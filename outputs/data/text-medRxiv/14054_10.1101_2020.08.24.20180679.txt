ABSTRACT

Introduction
Understanding the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to vaccine development,
epidemiological surveillance and control strategies. This systematic review critically evaluates
and synthesises the relevant peer-reviewed and pre-print literature published in recent months.

Methods
For this systematic review, independent keyword-structured literature searches were carried out
in MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19 Primer for studies published from 01/01/2020-26/06/2020.
Papers were independently screened by two researchers, with arbitration of disagreements by a
third researcher. Data were independently extracted into a pre-designed Excel template and
studies critically appraised using a modified version of the MetaQAT tool, with resolution of
disagreements by consensus. Findings were narratively synthesised.

Results
61 articles were included. Almost all studies used observational designs, were hospital-based,
and the majority had important limitations. Symptomatic adult COVID-19 cases consistently
show peripheral T cell lymphopenia, which positively correlates with increased disease severity,
duration of RNA positivity, and non-survival; while asymptomatic and paediatric cases display
preserved counts. People with severe or critical disease generally develop more robust, virusspecific T cell responses. T cell memory and effector function has been demonstrated against
multiple viral epitopes, and, cross-reactive T cell responses have been demonstrated in
unexposed and uninfected adults, but the significance for protection and susceptibility,
respectively, remains unclear.

Interpretation
A complex pattern of T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been demonstrated, but
inferences regarding population level immunity are hampered by significant methodological
limitations and heterogeneity between studies. In contrast to antibody responses, populationlevel surveillance of the cellular response is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. Focused
evaluation in specific sub-groups, including vaccine recipients, should be prioritised.

INTRODUCTION

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel pathogen causing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally and was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020.1 At the time of writing, there have
been around 22.3m confirmed cases and 782,456 deaths reported to the WHO.2 Lack of preexisting immunity to this novel and highly infectious betacoronavirus is likely to be responsible
for the extraordinary surge in cases worldwide.
There has been an unparalleled global effort to characterise the immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection, and to develop and test vaccine candidates at unprecedented speed.
Understanding the patterns in individual- and population-level immunity will be key to informing
future decisions on implementation of non-pharmacological interventions, broader public health
policies, and strategies for vaccine delivery.
While there is a rapidly growing body of literature on the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,
much less has been published on the cellular immune response, despite its critical importance
in antiviral immunity and vaccine development.
There are principally three areas of interest; firstly, the role of T cells in viral control and
immunopathogenesis during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; secondly the role of T cells in
establishing durable protective immunity against reinfection; finally, the relevance of pre-existing
cross-reactive cellular immunity from endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV), or SARS-CoV-1.3
This paper focuses on summarising current understanding of the cellular response to SARSCoV-2 infection, specifically exploring the role that T cell-mediated immunity might play in
resistance to severe infection, clinical and virological recovery, and long-term protection – while
recognising the dynamic interdependence of the two arms of the adaptive immune response. It
is the second of two linked papers4 summarising results from a wide-ranging systematic review
of peer-reviewed and pre-print literature on the human adaptive immune response to SARSCoV-2 infection.

METHODS

A systematic review was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was pre-registered with
PROSPERO (CRD42020192528).

Identification of studies
Keyword-structured searches were performed in MEDLINE, Embase, COVID-19 Primer and the
Public Health England library5 for articles published between 01/01/2020-26/06/2020. A sample
search strategy can be found in Supplementary Appendix A. We also consulted subject area
experts to identify relevant papers not captured through the database searches.

Definitions, inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included studies in all human and animal populations, and carried out in all settings
(laboratory, community and clinical - encompassing primary, secondary and tertiary care
centres), relevant to our research questions. We excluded case reports, commentaries,
correspondence pieces or letter responses, consensus statements or guidelines and study
protocols. We included studies reporting on any aspect of the T cell response, irrespective of
follow-up duration, and on correlates of that response. We defined “correlates” to include
(among others) age; gender; ethnicity; the presence of intercurrent or co-morbid disease e.g.
diabetes, cardiovascular, chronic respiratory disease; and primary illness severity, proxied by
the WHO’s distinction between “mild”, “moderate”, “severe” and “critical” COVID-19,6 or by
requirement for intensive care.

Selection of studies
Studies were independently screened on title, abstract and full text by two team members
(working across four pairs), and disagreements arbitrated by one of the review leads.

Data extraction, assessment of study quality, and data synthesis
Data were extracted in duplicate from each included study into a dedicated Microsoft Excel
template (Supplementary Appendix B). Pre-prints of subsequently published peer reviewed
papers were included, and results extracted where substantial differences in reported data were
identified; if little difference was found, only the peer-reviewed version was retained.

Critical appraisal for each included study was performed in duplicate using a version of the
MetaQAT 1.0 tool that was adapted for improved applicability to the basic science and
laboratory-based studies that are common in this field.7 The adapted MetaQAT tool was used to
gather both qualitative feedback on study quality, and scaled responses (yes/no/unclear) to
questions around study reliability, internal and external validity, and applicability, in turn
converted into weighted scores for each paper. Accordingly, studies were assigned a “high”,
“medium” or “low” quality grading. Full details of this process can be found in Supplementary
Appendix C.

Due to the degree of methodological heterogeneity across included studies, formal metaanalysis was not performed. Results are synthesised narratively in the sections that follow.

RESULTS

Descriptive overview of included studies:

A total of 9,223 records were identified through searches conducted for the review after deduplication, and a further five through expert consultation, of which 61 papers were included
(see PRISMA flowchart in figure 1).

Key characteristics of included studies are further summarised in table 1. Of the included
reports, 34 (58%) were peer-reviewed journal papers. The most common designs were casecontrol (n=26, 43%) and cohort (n=22, 36%), with 50 studies (82%) considering human
participants sampled from hospital settings, and most originating from China (n=32, 52%). Only
five studies (8%) specifically examined cellular responses in children; while only one study
examined differences by gender, and none by ethnicity (see table 2). Most studies were rated of
medium quality (n-44, 72%), with ten (16%) achieving a high-quality rating.

The majority of included papers commented on general aspects of the cellular response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the acute phase of illness, though the duration of this period was not
explicitly defined. Methods used to quantify the T cell response varied between studies; for
example, Laing et al partnered a total lymphocyte count from a full blood count and flow
cytometry to derive estimates of absolute T cell subset counts based on the gated percentages,
while other studies used direct quantification of lymphocyte subsets, such as TruCount™ and
Flow-Count™ Fluorosphere technology.

Higher quality studies consistently found evidence for reduction of total peripheral T cell counts
in symptomatic adult patients during the acute phase, often accompanied by increased
activation of remaining T cells and evidence of functional ‘exhaustion’, as defined by expression
of the markers PD-1 and Tim-3; however findings regarding specific subsets were more mixed.
Three well-designed cohort studies8–10 showed reductions in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts
in clinical cohorts ranging in size from 30 to 187 patients, while two found evidence of greater
reductions in CD8+ (cytotoxic) than CD4+ (helper) T cells.8,9 A cohort study (n=17 patients) only
found evidence of reduction in CD4+ but not CD8+ T cell counts on comparing patients with
‘aggravated’ (or clinically progressive) with non-aggravated disease.11 A cohort study of 64
patients from Italy showed that T cell frequencies were maintained in patients with mild and
asymptomatic disease.12 Broadly similar findings emerge from a range of high-quality casecontrol studies, typically with much larger sample sizes. Three hospital-based case-control
studies with sample sizes ranging from 102 to 522 patients found evidence of globally reduced
lymphocyte counts (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) in the acute phase.13–15 These findings were
also reflected in two summary reviews.3,16 The first, a medium-quality meta-analysis
incorporating data on 5,912 patients across 35 published/pre-print reports, showed that total
numbers of B cells, T cells and natural killer (NK) cells were all significantly decreased in
COVID-19 patients' peripheral blood.16 This picture of peripheral T cell lymphopenia in COVID19 patients is reinforced by findings from a larger body of medium- to low-quality observational
studies.e.g.16–18 Notably, four studies considering cellular responses in paediatric COVID-19
cases universally demonstrated comparable T cell counts to healthy paediatric controls, or
higher counts when compared against adult cases.19–21 The one study to evaluate responses in
asymptomatic adult cases (n=20) found little change in the circulating T cell counts within this
group also.12

Five studies provided more detailed analysis of T cell phenotypes in severe and/or critical
disease.12,22–25 A high-quality study by Anft et al. (n=53) found significant peripheral depletion in
critical patients of activated (e.g. HLA-DR+) memory/effector T cells that co-express tissue
migratory markers (e.g. CD11a), when compared to severe and moderate cohorts.22 Lower
frequencies of terminally differentiated T-cell subsets (TEMRA) were found in patients with both
severe and critical disease. Importantly, recovery from acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) was accompanied by a restoration of CD11a+ T cell subsets. Two studies of critically ill
patients identified stronger inflammatory cytokine T cell responses to spike protein,22 and to
spike, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins, with greater reactivity by CD4+ compared to CD8+
cells

23

within this group, respectively. Carsetti et al. reported an overall increase in activated

(e.g. HLA-DR+) CD4+ T cells in 16 patients across both mild and severe disease but found that
HLA-DR+ CD8+ cells were specifically increased in severe disease.12 Two studies also found
increased numbers of activated T cells in patients with severe and critical disease, with reversal
upon disease remission.24,25

Accompanying T cell dysregulation, a cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-like clinical picture
occurs in many patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.26 Elevated levels of many proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, and to lesser degree, IL-10, and TNF-α were identified in
patients in four studies.3,27–29 Concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6
positively correlated to severity of disease and with lymphopenia.9,13,16,17,24,30–36 A large peerreviewed study with 1,018 participants reported over ten-fold increases in IL-6 levels amongst
COVID-19 cases, and found that

serum IL-6

>20pg/mL was strongly associated with in-

hospital mortality (OR 9.78, p<0.001) on an adjusted multivariable regression analysis.36 A preprint systematic review reported 1.93-fold increases in IL-6 and 1.55-fold increases in IL-10 for
severe patients.16 In line with this, another large study (n=548) reported significantly increased
IL-6 levels in non-survivors compared with survivors.34 Correspondingly, levels of IL-6 and IL-10
appeared to be negatively correlated with total T cell and subset counts across all included
studies, and showed normalisation in tandem with clinical resolution.13 Findings for IL-1, IL-2,
IL-4 and IL-8 were more mixed.13,16,24,32,33,35,37

Dynamics of the T cell response over time during the acute phase

Seven studies reported longitudinal data on the cellular response, mostly focusing on withinhospital trends, with a maximum follow-up range of 14-44 days following symptom

onset.10,14,17,32,38–40 Two large high-quality case-control studies (n=103 and n=187) found that
low T cell counts on admission increased steadily over the course of admission. Subsequent
recovery of lymphocyte count was roughly consistent with clinical improvement.10,14 One study
found evidence of significant decreases in counts of CD3+ T, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells in
COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (all p<0.05) on admission. In a subset of
n=23 patients followed up two weeks after initial presentation, those with newly negative PCR
results showed the most dramatic recoveries in T cell subset counts.14 Two studies reported
longitudinal trends in detail at regular follow-up intervals; the first, a cohort study from Italy
involving 18 patients (nine mild and nine severe cases), found that low total lymphocyte counts
in severe cases were stably maintained for up to 20 days post-admission, with little discernible
difference between T cell subsets.17 The second, a French cohort study (n=15) of predominantly
elderly patients admitted to intensive care, found that CD8+ counts fell to their lowest value by
days 11-14 after symptom onset (p=0.03), with recovery thereafter, but noted a slightly later
nadir for CD4+ (days 19-23) and with no significant change in the overall CD4/CD8 ratio
throughout the 35-day follow-up period.39

Correlates of the T cell response

The number of studies addressing demographic and clinical correlates of the cellular response
was small and many potentially important variables such as ethnicity were not addressed. Key
findings from this literature are summarised in table 2. The largest single body of work
examined relationships between T cell response and disease severity, based predominantly on
studies in the hospital setting. Definitions of clinical severity employed in these studies were
variable (most as per WHO, however some were based on Chinese national guidance).

Viral cross-reactivity of T cells

Eight studies explored cross-reactivity of T cells between SARS-CoV-2 and related human
coronaviruses within small adult-only cases and controls.41–48. Using activation-induced marker
assays, Grifoni et al. detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells against a range of spike and
non-spike epitopes in 12/20 pre-pandemic US donors42 while Weiskopf et al reported low levels
of cross-reactivity in only 2/10 pre-pandemic German donors.48 Using IFN-γ ELISpot, Gallais et

al found some T cell cross-reactivity mainly to the S2-domain in 5/10 pre-pandemic French
donors41 and Le Bert et al found T cells specific to nucleocapsid protein (NP) and non-structural
proteins 7 and 13 (NSP7, NSP13) in SARS-CoV-1/2 unexposed donors.43 The latter Singaporebased study also reported robust SARS-CoV-2 NP-reactivity in T cells from SARS-CoV-1
convalescents, with these memory cells persisting for 17 years after the SARS outbreak.43

Amongst controls recruited during the pandemic, but confirmed as antibody- and PCR-negative,
spike-reactive T cells were demonstrated in 23/68 controls in a high-quality German study;44
and in 12/14 controls in a medium-quality Russian study, including one household contact of a
COVID-19 case. The latter study also included a smaller group of pre-pandemic donors (n=10),
who had significantly lower frequency and magnitude of reactivity than the controls recruited
during the pandemic, hinting at a possible protective effect of cross-reactive T cells.45 In
contrast, Peng et al. found no SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in either pre-pandemic or
during-pandemic antibody-negative UK controls (n=19).46

Notably, studies consistently found a lower frequency and magnitude of T cell response as well
as a differential pattern of immunodominance in reactive unexposed controls relative to SARSCoV-2 convalescents, with low homology between COVID-19 convalescent T cell epitopes and
known epitopes from other HCoV. Interestingly, an Australian study found that frequencies of T
follicular helper (TFH) cells specific to HCoV-HKU1 were higher amongst COVID-19
convalescents (n=41) than uninfected controls (n=27), suggesting boosting of HKU1-specific
responses following SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and hinting at a coronavirus-specific TFH
response.47

Characterisation of T-cell subpopulations and protective immunity

Twelve studies characterised T-cell subpopulations, including magnitude, functionality and
phenotypic characteristics, post-acute COVID-19 infection. Timing of sampling differed both
within and between studies (supplementary appendix D). One French contact-tracing study
demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses against structural (spike, membrane,
nucleocapsid) and accessory proteins in all nine index cases, in samples collected at 47-69
days post symptom-onset, as well as in 6/8 PCR-negative or untested contacts (of whom five
were symptomatic), in samples collected up to 80 days post-onset.41 A UK-based study of

COVID-19 convalescents (28 mild cases, 14 severe cases) characterised the T cell response
using IFN-γ ELISpot assays on samples taken at least 28 days post symptom onset.46 A strong
and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response was generally elicited but varied between
individuals. T cell response breadth (p=0.010) and magnitude (p=0.002) were significantly
higher in patients who recovered from severe disease in comparison to mild cases. Sub-set
evaluation demonstrated CD8+ T cells mediated a greater proportion of responses detected to
spike and membrane (M) or NP epitopes. No difference in the levels of polyfunctional T cells
was observed between mild and severe disease. Differences were observed in the cytokine
profiles of CD8+ T cells targeting different viral antigens, with the M/NP-specific CD8+ T cells
displaying wider functionality compared to those targeting spike protein (p=0.0231). In those
with mild disease, M/NP-specific CD8+ T cells were significantly higher than spike-specific T
cells. This trend was not observed in those with severe disease.46

These findings complement the study by Grifoni et al (discussed above) which found that NP, M
and spike contain the immunodominant epitopes for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.42 No
significant differences in the cytotoxic potential was detected between mild and severe disease.
Specific SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells were not frequently observed in healthy, unexposed
individuals. Furthermore, the magnitude of T cell responses in COVID-19 patients correlated
with related antibody titres (anti-spike, anti-RBD and anti-NP). Another study stimulated
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 18 COVID-19 patients ranging in disease
severity with two overlapping peptide pools spanning the full spike region.44 Twelve patients had
detectable CD4+ T cell reactivity against the first peptide pool, which contained N-terminal
epitopes including the RBD. Fifteen patients displayed reactive CD4+ T cells against the second
peptide pool, which contained C-terminal epitopes processing higher homology with HCoVs.
Among the non-reactive cases most had critical disease.44

Le Bert et al assayed peripheral blood T cell responses to NP and NSP7 and NSP13 of the
large SARS-CoV-2 proteome using an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. Samples were obtained from 24
individuals who had experienced mild to severe COVID-19. For all patients, IFN-γ spots were
observed following stimulation with NP peptide and nearly all displayed responses against
multiple regions of NP. A further sub-analysis demonstrated T cell recognition of multiple
regions of SARS-CoV-2 NP among recovered patients (8/9).43

Six studies reported on the phenotypic and target profile of T cell subsets. One study performed
an in-depth characterisation of humoral and cellular immunity against the spike protein in
samples taken from 41 adults who had recovered from mild-moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection
(five requiring hospitalisation but not mechanical ventilation) and 27 controls. Expanded
populations of spike-specific memory B cells and circulating (c)TFH cells (which play a critical
role in supporting antigen-specific B cells to initiate and maintain humoral immune responses)
were detected.47 The frequencies of unstimulated cTFH cells were comparable between SARSCoV-2 convalescent and uninfected groups. In general, robust cTFH cells activity to the SARSCoV-2 spike protein was observed among the convalescent group, whereas responses to RBDspecific cTFH were significantly lower (p<0.0001). The antigen reactivity of spike-specific noncTFH CD4 memory (CD3+CD4+CD45RA-CXCR5-) cells revealed similar trends with strong
recognition of SARS-CoV-2 and smaller frequencies of RBD-specific T cells. High plasma
neutralisation activity was also found to be associated with increased spike-specific antibody,
but notably also with the relative distribution of spike-specific cTFH subsets.47

Another study analysed the cellular response in samples taken from 31 COVID-19 patients,
none of whom required intensive care or oxygen supplementation. A central memory phenotype
(CD45RO+, CCR7+), followed by an effector memory phenotype (CD45RO+, CCR7-) were
predominate within the spike-protein reactive CD4+ T cell population. An effector memory,
followed by the terminal effector cells (CD45RO-, CCR7-) were the predominant phenotypes
among antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. A significant increase in activated (CD38+, HLA-DR+) CD4+
T cells was detected among cases. Further T cell response characterisation showed CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell activation in response to full-length S-protein exposure, and the M-protein response
was significantly stronger (p=0.0352). A “mild” correlation between the magnitude of T-cell and
humoral responses was reported (anti-RBD IgG and CD8+ T-cell response r=0.386 p=0.0321),
whereas an interdependence was observed between the magnitude of CD8+ and CD4+
responses (r and p values not presented).45. Minervina and colleagues reported detection of T
cell clones within both the effector and central memory subpopulations, in samples obtained
from two returnees from countries with high SARS-CoV-2 transmission.49 Similarly, Weiskopf et
al, in their study of 10 COVID-19 patients who developed ARDS, reported that peripheral SARSCoV-2-specific CD4+ T-cells typically had a central memory phenotype (based on CD45RA and
CCR7 expression), whereas the majority of virus-specific CD8+ T-cells had a CCR7- effector
memory (TEM) or TEMRA phenotype.48 In contrast, a study of four COVID-19 positive
paediatric cases with mild disease, and five uninfected controls, found no difference in the

effector or central memory phenotypes of the CD8+ and CD4+ populations compared with
controls.21

A small study conducted a phenotypic analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in
samples obtained 20-47 days post positive PCR from individuals recently recovered from mild
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The analysis was conducted using combination SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cell detection with CyTOF. IFN-γ producing spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
detected, suggestive of a spike-specific Th1 response, where as Th2 and Th17 lineages were
not detected among spike-specific CD4+ T cells.50
Evidence of potential protective T cell mediated immunity is provided by one US-based study
that measured the cellular response in rhesus monkeys (n=9 cases, n=3 controls) upon repeat
challenge with pooled spike peptides. Based on IFN-γ ELISpot assays, cellular immune
responses were observed in the majority of animals, with a trend toward lower responses in the
lower dose groups. Intracellular cytokine staining assays demonstrated induction of both spikespecific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Post re-challenge, very limited viral RNA was
observed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day one following re-challenge in three animals,
with no viral RNA detected at subsequent timepoints. In contrast, high levels of viral RNA were
observed in the concurrently challenged naive animals. However, these findings to do not
exclude the possibility that protection was antibody dependent rather than due to T cell
immunity exclusively.51

DISCUSSION

Summary of key findings
Acutely, adult COVID-19 patients exhibit a depletion of T cells in the peripheral blood, the extent
of which is positively correlated with disease severity, whereas asymptomatic patients and
children tend to have preserved peripheral T cell counts. This suggests an important
relationship between pathogenesis and the circulating T cell pool. It has been speculated that
children may receive protection from a diverse naive T cell repertoire, with adults of increasing
age at higher risk due to immunosenescence.52 Unfortunately, few studies have explored the
relationship between T cells, age and clinical severity, with appropriate statistical adjustment.
There is also emerging evidence of an important role for the over-production of cytokines – in

particular IL-6 – in immunopathogenesis within COVID-19, however, drivers of these observed
changes remain poorly understood.

Although less comprehensive, longer-term data suggest that T cell reductions are transient, with
rapid recovery of counts within days to weeks of clinical recovery and PCR negativity. This
supports the hypothesis that T cells are sequestered rather than destroyed, although the
observation of similarly depleted T cell numbers in the BAL samples of severe patients indicates
that T cells are not simply recruited en masse to infected tissues.53

In the context of well-recognised variations in COVID-19 clinical outcomes by age, ethnicity and
co-morbid status, there is a striking shortage of robust evidence on demographic and clinical
correlates of the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2. We identified a single study considering
gender-related effects on T cells, and eight studies considering cellular responses with age (a
majority of these in paediatric patients with or without adult controls). We identified no studies
evaluating other potentially important determinants, including ethnicity.

Evidence characterising cellular immune responses suggest enduring T cell immunity, with
phenotypic profiles consistent with helper and memory T cell functions and evidence of activity
against multiple viral targets. Variation in viral targets is observed between disease severity and,
based on one study, the breadth and magnitude of the T cell response were significantly higher
in patients who recovered from severe compared to mild disease. Responses were also
detected in individuals who experienced mild infection. However, this evidence derives from
small, observational studies conducted on samples taken at varying time points from individuals,
with selection criteria rarely described. The longevity of this T cell immunity and the degree of
protection it provides remains unknown.

Strengths and limitations of the study
This study is the first to systematically evaluate and critically appraise the published literature on
the T cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2, more than eight months since it has emerged.
Formative reviews of evidence on the immune response are narrative with few exceptions, or
focus on specific aspects.16,54 Our review is broader in scope and comprehensiveness.

Limitations arise from the methodology applied, and from the nature of the underlying evidence.
First, while the search strategy was broad in choice of keywords and inclusion of pre-print

publications, it is possible that some results were missed, particularly on pre-print servers for
which structured searches are more challenging. Additional limitations arise from the nature of
the underlying evidence base on which this review draws. Variations in reporting practice
present major challenges for critical appraisal and weighting of evidence. For example, narrative
reviews – popular in this field – have limited methods reporting. Further difficulty is introduced
through the varying treatment protocols employed, clinical severity and case definitions, and
varying methods adopted for T cell counts, functionality, phenotypes, and assay validation.
These considerations are critical to study T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as the assays are
evolving and yet to be formally validated and standardised. Thirdly, many of the studies have
important methodological limitations, notably; small sample sizes, minimal reporting on
participation selection and reasons for follow-up, non-blinding, and widespread lack of statistical
analysis that control for confounders.

Policy and practice implications

Many unanswered questions remain, such as the durability of and protection afforded by virusspecific T cell responses, and their relative importance in protection from reinfection compared
with antibodies. More data is also needed on correlates of T cell responses and the potential of
cross-reactive cellular immunity.

An important application of findings from cellular response studies will be towards the
development, evaluation, and implementation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In parallel with
emerging data from COVID-19 patients, vaccine developers have begun to report on cellular
immunogenicity from early phase evaluations, though this is notably lacking from the pre-print

demonstrated T cell responses against S-proteins. Responses for the CanSino candidate were
limited, however, by likely pre-existing immunity to the human adenovirus 5 vector. Furthermore,
unlike for the second dose of Moderna’s mRNA vaccine, cellular responses were not boosted
after a second dose of Oxford’s chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine.56–58 While there is an
understandable demand for candidates able to provide protection with a single dose, vaccines
which allow boosting of cellular responses may better mimic natural immunity against endemic
coronaviruses. It is also worth considering whether spike -focused platforms will be able to fully
harness the cellular response potential, or whether traditional inactivated whole-virus and novel

virus-like particle platforms, which provide a fuller range of epitopes, will be necessary to build
durable, protective immunity across populations. It will be important to evaluate vaccine efficacy
in groups with high prevalence of previous exposure or infection, such as health and care staff,
who will be a priority group following licensure. In addition to antibody testing, baseline
assessments of virus-specific T cell reactivity are likely to be highly useful for this purpose.

Current estimates of population immunity rely solely on seroprevalence studies, however in the
context of evidence for cellular responses in seronegative exposed individuals, and the
apparent waning of antibody responses over time, current surveillance methods are likely to be
underestimating both exposure and immunity. A more developed understanding of the role of T
cells in long-term protection will be helpful to policy makers in terms of modelling where
population-level immunity lies and informing long-term surveillance and immunisation strategies.
However, by contrast with antibody testing – a mainstay of immune surveillance for many
communicable diseases – existing T cell assays are difficult to standardise and hard to scale,
therefore unlikely to be deliverable at population level within the timeframe of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic. In the short-term, emphasis may need to be placed on determining the utility of T cell
assays to guide clinical and public health actions at the individual level, particularly in patients
with immunosuppression, or those at the extremes of age. In parallel, adequately powered and
controlled studies providing deep immunophenotyping of T cells, B cells, and comprehensive
characterisation of immune responses in mild or asymptomatic cases, and in vaccine recipients,
will yield insights about the interdependence and relative importance of cellular and humoral
responses. Over the long-term, development of scalable T cell assays may help to strengthen
population immune surveillance systems.

Conclusions
A complex picture is emerging concerning the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2
infection, including the interplay between compartments of the immune systems, and the
balance between protective versus pathological responses. Inferences are limited by
methodological limitations within studies, and heterogeneity between studies. Evaluation of
cellular responses at scale is currently infeasible and the benefits as yet unclear. Findings from
targeted testing may carry important clinical and policy implications for public health
interventions within at-risk sub-groups, for understanding mechanisms of vaccine efficacy, and
for informing long-term population immunisation and surveillance strategies.

Findings
•

One study evaluated T cell responses in asymptomatic patients (n=20) and found little change in the
circulating T cell frequencies within this group.12

Reduced numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in moderate and severe cases, alongside increased
numbers of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 or Tim-3; as well as potential reductions
in cytotoxic potential and polyfunctionality reported in one narrative review.3
Cell counts
•
A medium quality meta-analysis found that patients with severe disease had statistically significant, twofold decreases in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as in CD3+ T cells (1.7-fold) and overall
lymphocyte number (1.44-fold), alongside statistically significant increases in neutrophils (1.33-fold) and
16
overall leukocytes (1.2-fold).
•
A large study (N=599) by Diao et al. reported reduced total, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells being associated
with more severe disease, comparing n=43 ICU-admitted patients with non-ICU-admitted patients, and
comparing critical/severe non-ICU patients with mild/moderate non-ICU patients (as per Chinese
13
national definitions*).
10,32,34,59
•
Other large studies
showed comparable findings, and 3 studies also reported reduced CD3+
cells in more severe disease;10,34,59 however, Liu et al. only found significant cell count differences for
critical vs severe disease, and not for severe vs moderate disease.59
•

Cell ratios
•
Six studies reported marked increases in CD4/CD8 ratio (due to increases in CD4+ but reductions in
CD8+ cells) in severe and critical patients compared to those with moderate disease.9,22,30,34,60. The last
of these also showed CD8+ T cell counts were much slower to normalise than CD4+ in patients with
severe disease.60
•
Two studies however, reported significant reductions in CD4+, but not in CD8+, T cells in severe
disease (n=452), or ‘aggravated’ disease, defined as clinically progressive at 7 days (n=17).61,62
•
A small study from Iran reported increased CD8 expression in ICU patients relative to healthy controls,
quantified by flow cytometry as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), with no significant differences seen
in CD4/CD8 ratio, or CD4+ T cell MFI.63
Clinical

Survival vs nonsurvival

•

•
•

Two studies with large cohorts followed up COVID-19 patients until death or discharge, both conducting
multivariate analysis. Luo et al. (n=1018), reported significantly lower CD3+, CD4+ and especially CD8+
counts in non-survivors than survivors, and found that CD8+ T cell counts <165 cells/µL (OR 5.93) were
independently associated with mortality after adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities.36 Liu et al
(n=340) reported that lower helper T cells (OR 0.22) and higher CD4/CD8 ratio (OR 4.8) were highly
significant predictors of mortality.64
Whilst also reporting lower CD8+ counts in non-survivors throughout the disease course, Wang et al
(n=157) also found that non-survivors had lower CD4+ counts only evident in middle and late stages of
disease, and that non-survivors had a lower CD4/CD8 ratio.65
Based on 28 deaths amongst 187 patients, Xu et al demonstrated that total T cell counts <500/µl, CD3+
counts <200/µl, CD4+ or CD8+ counts <100/µ as well as B cell counts <50/µL, were significantly
10
associated with risk of in-hospital death, however this is only on univariate analysis.

In a cohort of n=548, Chen at al reported significantly elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR),
platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), reduced peripheral CD3+, CD4+ and particularly CD8+ counts in
non-survivors.34 He at al. (n=204) reported that T cell levels continued to fall until death in nonsurvivors, whilst in survivors with severe disease, levels increased after 15 days and normalised after
25 days of treatment.32
Four small but high or medium quality clinical cohort studies from China showed that slower resolution
of PCR-positivity is associated with reductions in peripheral T cells.
Jiang et al. (n=23) found that the baseline abnormalities in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells underwent
robust recovery in patients who became RNA negative 2 weeks after diagnosis, whilst they did not do
14
so in those who remained persistently positive.
Liu et al compared 37 cases who remained positive at day 20, with 37 patients at their point of
diagnosis, as well as 54 healthy controls, and showed that both the persistently positive and control
groups had higher CD3+ and CD4+ levels, suggesting that these subsets do normalise despite viral
persistence.40
In a similar study, though with a persistence threshold of 15 days, Dong et al (n=18) also found global
reductions across CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ subsets for persistent positives, which increased between
admission and discharge; as well as significant negative correlation between overall T cell count and
66
duration of positive nucleic acid test.
Liu et al. (n=39) also reported higher global T and B cells in patients becoming RT-PCR negative within
14 days.67
Three studies considered the effect of comorbid status, all originating from China and spanning patients
with non-severe, severe and critical clinical presentations.32,67,68 Two had significant methodological
limitations.67,68
One study (n=204) found significantly lower total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subset counts in patients
32
with comorbidities compared with those without (though “comorbidities” not defined).
+
The second (n=39) found statistically significant differences in CD8 counts between patients with
comorbid disease and those without (p=0.046), but no difference in CD4+ counts - although here again
the range of comorbidities considered was not defined.67
The final study compared outcomes in a paediatric cohort with or without “allergic disease” (not clearly
68
defined) and showed no effect on clinical course, total lymphocyte or lymphocyte subset counts.
A high-quality clinical cohort study and a medium-quality case-control study, both from China, reported
lower T cell total and subset counts, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ subsets, for older patients aged 60 or
over.13,32
Four medium-quality studies - 1 case control and 3 case series - considered cellular responses in
children in samples from China, all showing comparable CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ counts to healthy
paediatric controls, or where the comparison group was adults, higher T cell counts across
subsets.21,69–71 However, potential confounders such as disease severity or comorbidities were not
controlled for in these studies.
One medium-quality case series (n=27) from China examined differences in cytokine secretion by sex
+
+
of cases, showing reductions in CD4 and CD8 count for all patients irrespective of gender but more
generalised cytokine responses were observed among male participants than females, for IL-6, TNF-α
and procalcitonin – although the statistical significance of these differences was not tested.72
