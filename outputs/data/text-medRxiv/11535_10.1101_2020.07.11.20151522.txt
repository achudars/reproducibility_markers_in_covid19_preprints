Summary

Background. Inequalities and burden of comorbidities of the Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vary importantly inside the countries. We aimed to
analyze the Municipality-level factors associated with a high COVID-19 mortality
rate of in Mexico.
Methods. We retrieved information from 142,643 cumulative confirmed
symptomatic cases and 18,886 deaths of COVID-19 as of June 20th, 2020 from the
publicly available database of the Ministry of Health of Mexico. Public official data
of the most recent census and surveys of the country were used to adjust a negative
binomial regression model with the quintiles (Q) of the distribution of
sociodemographic and health outcomes among 2,457 Municipality-level.
Expected Mortality Rates (EMR), Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95%
Confidence Intervals are reported.
Results. Factors associated with high MR of COVID-19, relative to Quintile 1
(Q1), were; diabetes prevalence (Q4, IRR=2.60), obesity prevalence (Q5,
IRR=1.93), diabetes mortality rate (Q5, IRR=1.58), proportion of indigenous
population (Q2, IRR=1.68), proportion of economically active population (Q5,
IRR=1.50), density of economic units that operate essential activities (Q4,
IRR=1.54) and population density (Q5, IRR=2.12). We identified 1,351
Municipality-level without confirmed COVID-19 deaths, of which, 202 had
nevertheless high (Q4, Mean EMR= 8.0 deaths per 100,000) and 82 very high
expected COVID-19 mortality (Q5, Mean EMR= 13.8 deaths per 100,000).
Conclusion. This study identified 1,351 Municipality-level of Mexico that, in
spite of not having confirmed COVID-19 deaths yet, share characteristics that
could eventually lead to a high mortality scenario later in the epidemic and warn
against premature easing of mobility restrictions. Local information should be
used to reinforce strategies of prevention and control of outbreaks in communities
vulnerable to COVID-19.



Municipality-level factors associated with high mortality of COVID-19
were the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, mortality rate of diabetes, the



Municipality-level with high case-fatality rates of COVID-19 are likely
undergoing insufficient testing and should improve its availability.



Identified predictors ought to be considered by local governments to
reinforce tailored strategies to prevent casualties in populations
vulnerable to COVID-19, as mortality is expected to be eventually high in
some Municipality-level that may not have reached the apex of the
epidemic yet.

Introduction
The first case of the new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Mexico was
confirmed on February 28th, 20201. Since then, the Government of Mexico has
launched a series of preventive measures which adhere to the World Health
Organization (WHO) SARS-Cov-2 strategic preparedness and response plan
aimed at limiting the spread of the virus2. The “National Campaign for Healthy
Distance”, implemented from March 23rd to May 30th 2020 included social
distance, hand washing, general confinement, self-isolation for those with
COVID-19 associated symptoms for 14 days and limited economic mobility3. As
of June 20th, the spread of the virus continued to rise, resulting in 175 148
accumulated positive cases and 20 773 deaths4.
Globally, individual factors associated with COVID-19 mortality have been found
to be: male sex, age over 65 years, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease, among others5,6. According to the
2018 National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT-2018) of Mexico, 36.1%
of adults over the age of 19 were obese, 39.1% overweight, 13.7% diabetic and 25%
hypertensive7. Considering that most states in Mexico hold a heterogeneous
distribution in the prevalence of such comorbidities, regions with an increased
burden of these diseases and sociodemographic related factors are at higher risk
of encountering more severe manifestations of COVID-19 which might require
hospitalization or critical care, as well as higher COVID-19 mortality rates.
It is deemed that in order to curb the pandemic, national decisions ought to be in
coordination with those at a local level. In the United States sociodemographic
and health factors related to COVID-19 vary importantly across counties8-10.
Mexico has 2,457 Municipalities distributed in 32 states, which are the basis of
the territorial organization and the political and administrative division11. By June
1st, 2020, the federal government gave the states of the country the responsibility
for deciding the reopening of social, educational and economic activities based on
a “Traffic Light” system established by the MoH12. COVID-19 is however expected
to linger within communities for several months or even years to come. Targeted
public policy interventions in regions that are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 are
crucial to safeguard, protect and strengthen communities facing the pandemic.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the Municipality-level factors
associated with a higher mortality rate (MR) of COVID-19 in Mexico, and to
pinpoint locations expected to suffer from a high COVID-19 mortality.
Methods
Coronavirus pandemic surveillance in Mexico has been carried out using the
Sentinel model proposed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) 13.
This model works with 475 nationally representative health facilities that monitor
coronavirus cases through the test for SARS-CoV-2 conducted in ten percent of
suspected cases and 100% those suspected with severe acute respiratory
syndrome and signs of breathing difficulty, or in deaths of those hospitalized
suspected to be COVID-19 cases. The operational definition of a suspected case in
Mexico is of an individual who in the last 7 days presented at least 2 of the
following signs and symptoms: cough, fever, or headache, accompanied by at least
one of the following signs or symptoms: dyspnea, arthralgia, myalgia,
odynophagia/pharyngeal burning, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis and/or chest pain14.
A confirmed case of COVID-19 is defined as a person with a diagnosis given by the
National Network of Public Health Laboratories recognized by the Institute of
Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) who met the criteria of a
suspected case15.
We used the daily updated open data source from the General Directorate of
Epidemiology of Mexican MoH which includes demographic and health
information of confirmed, negative, and suspect cases of COVID-19.4 We extracted
the data as of June 20th, 2020 of the number of confirmed symptomatic cases and
deaths.
At the Municipality-level level, we obtained data on variables that we
hypothesized could be linked to differential testing practices or exposure to SARSCov-2 of the most recent and complete information from census, and records from
the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI per the Spanish
acronym) of the 2457 Municipality-level according to the 2017 geographical
division of the country16. We selected the following variables and years17-19;
population (2010 and 2015), illiteracy in population aged 15 years or more (2015),
proportion of indigenous population of 5 years or more (2010), proportion of the

population over 12 years of age who are economically active (2015), population
with private health insurance(2015), population affiliated to the Mexican Social
Security Institute (IMSS, per the Spanish acronym) (2015), population without
health care insurance (2019), proportion of households with indoor availability of
water service (2015), proportion of households without sewage drainage (2015),
population density (2015), and rate of economic units that operate essential
activities during COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico from the National Directory of
Economic Units/INEGI20.
From the Department of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Ministry of Health
(DGIS for its acronym in Spanish), we retrieved records of deaths due to diabetes,
hypertension and cardiovascular disease in adults over 20 years of age in 201821.
From the catalog of the Unique Key of Health Establishments (CLUES per the
Spanish acronym) we retrieved the number of medical units per Municipalitylevel for 2020 and we calculated the rate per 100 thousand inhabitants in the
Municipality for each type of medical unit22. Rates and proportions of the
variables at Municipality-level level were calculated using the annual population
projections from the National Population Council (CONAPO) 23. We obtained the
State level estimations for the prevalence of obesity, previously diagnosed
diabetes and previously diagnosed hypertension among adults aged 20 years and
over from the latest National Survey of Nutrition and Health (ENSANUT-2018)
24.

Statistical analysis
To identify the Municipality-level factors associated with the mortality rate of
COVID-19, we adjusted a negative binomial regression model in which the
dependent variable was the sum of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in symptomatic
cases (n=18 886) by Municipality of residence and the independent variables were
the quintiles of the distribution of sociodemographic and health outcomes within
the Municipality. Expected Mortality Rates (EMR) for each Municipality,
Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) and 95% Confidence Intervals were estimated.
To better understand the association between MR of COVID-19 and Municipalitylevel factors, and in addition to the main objective of the study, we also fitted

negative binomial regression models with the cumulative incidence rate of
confirmed symptomatic cases (n=142 643) [(cases/estimated population)*100
000 population], and with the case-fatality rate in confirmed deaths of COVID-19
(n=18 886 deaths) [(deaths/confirmed cases)*100] as of June 20, 2020. In a
supplementary table results are displayed stratified by months since the
beginning of the pandemic in Mexico.
Finally, to contrast our findings on mortality risk factors with those at individual
level in Mexico, we retrieved the following variables from the MoH coronavirus
database; age, sex, state, Municipality of residence, indigenous languages speaker,
diabetes, obesity, hypertension, COPD, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney
disease (CKD), immunosuppression, asthma, the dates of symptom onset, the
hospital admission, and death. We excluded 429 cases as they had incomplete
information on the covariates above mentioned. We fitted a Poisson regression
model where the dependent variable was the binary outcome of death due to
COVID-19 and the independent variables were the characteristics and binary
comorbidities of the individual. The analysis and maps were developed using the
statistical program STATA 14 (Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College
Station, TX: StataCorp LP), findings at p<0.05 were considered significant.
Results
From 402 083 observations, 35% were positive symptomatic cases of COVID-19,
50.3% negative and 14.2% suspect cases. The proportion of deaths was 11 .8% in
positive cases, 2.56% in negative cases, and 2.71% in suspect cases. At the moment
of the analysis, two thirds of the Municipality-level had symptomatic cases and
almost half had reported deaths due to COVID-19. (data not shown)
In Table 1 are displayed the means and 95% CI of the Municipal and State-level
factors included in the study, source of information and year of reference.
Municipality-level factors associated with high mortality of COVID-19 were the
prevalence of diabetes (Quintile 4, IRR= 3.43, 95% CI; 1.75-2.98), and obesity
(Quintile 5, IRR= 1.72, 95% CI; 1.20-2.47), the mortality rate of diabetes (Quintile
5, IRR= 1.49, 95% CI: 1.15-1.93), proportion of indigenous population (Quintile 4,
IRR= 1.51, 95% CI; 1.20-1.91), proportion of economically active population

(Quintile 5, IRR= 1.59, 95% CI; 1.09-1.32), and population density (Quintile 5,
IRR; 2.5, 95% CI; 1.78-3.51). Factors inversely associated with lower mortality of
COVID-19 at the Municipality-level were the hypertension prevalence (Quintile 5,
IRR= 0.39, 95%CI; 0.29-0.52) and characteristics of marginalized populations
such as; illiteracy (Quintile 5, IRR= 0.62, 95% CI; 0.40-0.95), houses without
drainage (Quintile 5 IRR; 0.71, 95% CI; 0.51-0.90), houses with dirt floors
(Quintile 5, IRR= 0.68, 95%CI; 0.47-1.00), proportion of population without
health care insurance (Quintile 5, IRR= 0.66, 95%CI; 0.45-0.96). (Table 2)
Municipality-level factors associated with high cumulative incidence rate of
COVID-19 were similar than those associated to high mortality, except by the
proportion of indigenous population (Quintile 5, IRR; 0.70, 95%CI; 0.57-0.86)
and the proportion of houses without sewage drainage (Quintile 5, IRR= 0.80;
0.65-1.00) which were inversely associated (Table 2). Finally, Municipality-level
factors associated with higher case-fatality of COVID-19 were as well the
prevalence of diabetes (Quintile 5, IRR= 2.11, 95%CI; 1.19-3.74), obesity
prevalence (Quintile 5, IRR; 2.37, 95%CI; 1.06-5.29), extreme poverty (Quintile 5,
IRR= 3.17, 95%CI; 1.37-7.33), and rate of social assistance medical units (Quintile
5, IRR; 2.47, 95%CI; 1.37-4.46). Quintiles of Crude mortality and expected
mortality rates of COVID-19 at Municipality-level-level are shown in Map 1 and
Map 2, respectively.
We identified 1 351 Municipality-level without COVID-19 deaths reported in
symptomatic cases, which according to its characteristics, 202 had high and 82
very high EMR of COVID-19 (Q4, Mean= 8.0, 95%CI: 5.7-11.2 and Q5, Mean=
13.8, 95%CI: 9.97-19.1 respectively). Supplementary Table 1 lists the name and
characteristics of the Municipality-level with high expected mortality rate COVID19 based on the significant risk factors identified in the binomial regression model
(Table 2). It is observed that many Municipality-level of the states of Oaxaca
(n=68), Yucatán (n=60), Sonora (n=33) Veracruz (n=25), Puebla (n=24) and
Michoacán (n=18) had the highest expected mortality rates (Quintile 4, Mean=
8.01, 95%CI; 7.85-8.17) (Quintile 5, Mean= 13.7, 95%CI; 13.1-14.4). It is observed
that 43 Municipality-level with high expected mortality of COVID-19 are Hope
Municipality-level. Case-fatality rate of COVID-19 in symptomatic cases are
shown in Supplementary Map 1. Can be observed that some Municipality-level of

the States of Oaxaca, Chihuahua and Guerrero had case-fatality rates of COVID19 higher than 80%.
At the individual level, we also explored characteristics of the confirmed
symptomatic cases that were associated with higher lethality of COVID-19 in order
to observed if the risk factors observed in other countries remain in the Mexican
context. (supplementary Table 2.) In concordance with the Municipality-level
results, diabetes, belonging to an indigenous ethnic group, and obesity were
associated with higher risk of mortality due to coronavirus. Other individual risk
factors of lethality-case were age 40 or over, male sex, hypertension, CKD, COPD
and immunosuppression. In addition, having received medical care in private
health institutions was associated with a lower lethality of COVID-19 compared to
those cared for at public health services. As for individuals who sought medical
attention between 6 and 14 days after the onset of symptoms, they had a higher
risk of dying compared to those who received medical care between 0 and 5 days
after the onset of symptoms.
In supplementary Table 3, we illustrate the Municipality-level factors associated
to the cumulative incidence and lethality rates as of June 20th, 2020 and
disaggregated by month. We found that Municipality-level factors association
with cumulative incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 varied within the
course of the pandemic in Mexico.

Discussion
Municipality-level factors found to be associated with higher risk of mortality of COVID-19
were the population density, the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, the mortality rate of
diabetes, the proportion of indigenous population, of economically active population and
the rate of economic units that operate essential activities during the COVID-19 outbreak.
First, high proportion of population economically active may reflect lower confinement and
increased mobility, while higher population density is may be related to less social distancing
and high connectivity. Secondly, high mortality rate of diabetes means inadequate control
of glucose levels - which has a negative impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems
both crucial in the body’s response to COVID-1925 - and also, lower access and quality of
medical care, or weaker local health care systems26.
Despite of at the individual level, the hypertension was associated with higher lethality of
COVID-19. At the Municipality level, the mortality rate of hypertension was not associated
with high mortality of COVID-19, and within States with the highest prevalence of
hypertension they had lower mortality risk of COVID-19. This result could be explained by
the fact that the prevalence used in our model came from adults already diagnosed with
hypertension, which according to previous surveys represented approximately 60% of the
total cases of hypertensive population and are those with access to health care services and
antihypertensive medication27. Nevertheless, unknown and unobserved variables, prior to
the demand of healthcare services might be reflecting an inverse association between
hypertension and COVID-19 mortality.

It is important to note that the cumulative incidence of cases in indigenous populations was
low; however, the risk of mortality from coronavirus was higher than in Municipalities with
lower proportion of indigenous population. These findings could indicate a lower access to
healthcare services and testing, combined with a dynamic where the epidemic migrates
further into more marginalized areas with a higher proportion of indigenous population.
Other countries have found that many mechanisms underlying the higher lethality of
COVID-19 in ethnic minorities are related to marginalization conditions such as locality of
residence, work conditions and health inequalities28,29.
Marginalized conditions such as non-sewage service or dirt floors were inversely associated
with mortality of COVID-19. Communities with these household characteristics are mostly
remote and with low connectivity, which could be protective from SARs-cov-2 exposure.
Notwithstanding, marginalized and remote communities could also have lower access to
both testing for SARs-Cov-2 and health care which could lead to underreporting of cases and
deaths. Special screening strategies and tracing and isolation of contacts within these
vulnerable communities are essential to favor the prevention of deaths from COVID-1930.
In May 2020, the Mexican MoH published a list of 324 Municipios de la Esperanza (“Hope
Municipalities”) which in the last 28 days prior to May 16 did not have any confirmed cases
of COVID-19 and were not adjacent to municipalities with confirmed cases. This list was a
guide for State governors to restart non-essential activities on May 18, 202031. However,
according to our results, 16% of these Municipality-level are at high risk of having worse
outcomes in the event of an outbreak and, as of June 20, 2020, 389 symptomatic cases and
29 deaths due to COVID-19 were confirmed in these municipalities.
The identification of municipalities with a high burden of risk factors of severe illness or
death of COVID-19 is critical to establish the most convenient health policies at the

Municipality level. Many of these municipalities are in locations susceptible to an outbreak
onset as the pandemic evolves in Mexico. municipalities with no confirmed cases yet, but
with populations at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 could have a greater
burden of the disease in the upcoming months if contingency measures and mobility
restrictions are eased to soon. A targeted approach will be crucial to prevent or control the
onset of new outbreaks within these municipalities include testing, isolation and contact
tracing as well as more general measures according to the three-stage traffic light system
that was established in Mexico to reactivate the economy and reduce contingency
measures12.
Additional to the Municipality-level factors associated with the cumulative incidence and
mortality of COVID-19 we identified that Municipalities in condition of extreme poverty had
higher case-fatality rate of COVID-19. For example, Oaxaca, Chihuahua and Guerrero are
States in which some municipalities had case-fatality rates higher than 80%. This finding
suggests a low availability of tests in this communities.
As per the limitations within our study, que precision of the estimations depends on the
quality of the databases for example; the aging of our data for some variables is up to 10
years, which may not reflect heterogeneous changes within municipalities by 2020.
Nevertheless, data from previous years, still holds relation to the following years and they
were useful to find expected associations. For obesity, diabetes and hypertension prevalence,
the information from the ENSANUT-2018 are representatively at State level reducing the
variability within Municipalities. However, for the rest of the variables, such as mortality
rates of diabetes and hypertension, information was disaggregated at the municipality.
Finally, the ecological design of our study prevented us to from establishing causal
associations.

To our knowledge this is the first study that estimated mortality rate of COVID-19 by using
the burden of related comorbidities and sociodemographic characteristics, in order to
identify municipalities at risk of high mortality rates of coronavirus in Mexico. Our findings
could contribute to the national strategic preparedness and response plans towards a “new
normality”30 by informing at a Municipality-level level factors ought to consider in the
decision-making process and public health interventions to minimize the negative impact of
COVID-19 on the health and livelihoods of the most at-risk communities.
Based on our results, we considered this is a good moment to modify the current
epidemiological surveillance strategy for confirming COVID-19 positive cases and deaths in
populations who might be under-reported by the Sentinel surveillance approach. For
instance, indigenous communities and communities with extreme poverty could be affected
not only by the risks of COVID-19 afflicting the health of the population, but also by
increasing food insecurity, domestic violence, disrupting the routine care of chronic diseases
or the economic repercussions this might bring. It is critical to count on data on the impact
of COVID-19 amongst these populations to identify, prioritize and address the needs of these
vulnerable populations.
Conclusion
Using small area demographic characteristics and burden of comorbidities of COVID-19 is
useful to identify locations at risk of COVID-19 mortality. In Mexico, Municipality-level risk
factors associated with high mortality rates of COVID-19 were high proportion of the
population economically active, high population density, high proportion of indigenous
population, and high diabetes mortality. Based on their characteristics many of the
municipalities that have not experienced high mortality yet are prone to do so as the
epidemic curve progresses. We therefore warn against overconfidence and premature easing
