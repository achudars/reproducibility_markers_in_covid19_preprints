Background: Given the COVID-19 pandemic’s, researchers are beseeched for effective
treatments. Herbal medicine is also queried for potential supplementary treatments for COVID19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of Sugarcane, Black Myrobalan, and Mastic herbal
medications for COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a double-blinded randomized clinical
trial study conducted over three months from May to July 2020 in patients admitted with a
diagnosis of COVID-19 in Peymaniyeh Hospital in Jahrom, Iran. The intervention group
received the treatment protocol approved by the Ministry of Health of Iran during the period of
hospitalization and the herbal supplement obtained from the combination of black myrobalan
and mastic and sugarcane, twice a day (3g of herbal supplements). All patients were compared
in terms of demographic variables, vital signs, clinical and laboratory variables. Results: 72
patients with COVID-19, divided into intervention (n=37) and control (n=35) groups.
intervention and control groups had not any significant difference in terms of baseline
characteristics. The time-to-event analysis revealed a significant difference in 4 symptoms of
cough, fever, dyspnea, and myalgia (P<0.05). The Control group had a significantly lower
decrease in C-reactive protein during 7 days (P<0.05). Patients in the herbal supplement group
were hospitalized for 4.12 days and in the control group were hospitalized for 8.37 days
(P=0.001). ICU admission and death only happened in 3 (8.6%) patients of the control group.
Conclusion: While advanced studies with more sample size are needed; the proposed
combination seems to be effective in the symptom treatment and reducing the length of
hospitalization.

COVID-19 is a viral disease that has been responsible for the deaths of large numbers of people around
the world in 2020. COVID-19 causes pneumonia, with classic symptoms of fever, cough, dyspnea, and
myalgia (Park et al., 2020). It can have so wide range of symptoms and also damage other organs such as
the heart, liver, kidneys. Some patients eventually die from multiple organ failure, shock, acute
respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmia, and renal failure (Cevik et al., 2020). During this
pandemic, various clinical trials have been launched to examine different medications, mainly with
properties in strengthening the body's immune system, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties to
prevent cytokine storm (Maguire and Guérin, 2020). Meanwhile, various studies have shown that
traditional herbal medicine could improve the symptoms of COVID-19 (Li et al., 2020). In this regard,
Traditional Iranian Medicine (TIM) has potential propositions that could be taken to account as
medications to improve COVID-19 symptoms. Some clinical trials are being conducted in Iran to assess
the effect of herbal medications for COVID-19. One of our potential herbal candidates for this aim was
the Black myrobalan (Terminalia chebula or black myrobalan) (Singh and Kumar, 2013), due to its wide
range of biologically active compounds and its applications in TIM for the treatment of respiratory tract
diseases (Saleem et al., 2002; Belapurkar et al., 2014). Our next candidate, sugarcane (Saccharum
officinarum) has been used extensively in TIM (Singh et aa;., 2015). Its beneficial effects are supported
by in vivo/vitro studies, including antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, and antihepatotoxic activity (Arruzazabala et al., 1994; Ledon et al., 2003; Jin et al., 1981). Pistacia lentiscus
resina (mastics) was another herb that attracted researchers due to reducing the symptoms of autoimmune
diseases by inhibiting the hyperinflammatory pathways (Dimas et al., 2012). In this study, we examined
the combining of these three plants (Sugarcane, black myrobalan, and mastic) along with the treatment
protocol of the Ministry of Health on COVID_19 patients.

The study population was patients admitted with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 in the wards of
Peymanieh Hospital in Jahrom. Sample size assuming standard difference=0.85 and confidence limits of
95% and power = 80% and assuming an equal number of samples in each group using Altman nomogram
and taking into account 15% precipitation, 70 Person was determined. Then, to have an equal chance of
being in the intervention group or control group, the samples were randomly assigned to the study groups
using a random number table.

All patients with inclusion criteria at the time of the study, after obtaining written consent and explaining
the study conditions, entered the study. patients participating in the present study were divided into
intervention and control groups by tossing coins. Patients were adjusted for age and sex. The treatment
protocol in the two groups of intervention and control was as follows. the intervention group received the
treatment protocol approved by the Ministry of Health of Iran during the period of hospitalization and the
herbal supplement obtained from the combination of black myrobalan and mastic and sugarcane, twice a
day. the control group only received the approved treatment protocol. Based on a literature review,
optimal doses with the lowest risk of adverse events were chosen. In the case of sugarcane, according to
the American Heart Association (AHA), the permissible daily intake of sugar for women is 6 teaspoons
equivalent to 25 grams, and for men, 9 teaspoons equivalent to 36 grams; in our study, 3 grams sugarcane
per day (1.5 grams BID) was used based on the TIM principles, which was safe based on the AHA
principles, too. Black myrobalan extract was used in a dose of the 1 gram single dose per day.

117
118

In the case of the mastic, a dose of 1 gram twice daily has been approved for the treatment of benign
gastric ulcers. Also, we used 1 gram mastic twice daily in our study.

To prepare the desired herbal supplement, sugarcane, mastic, and black myrobalan were purchased from
approved herb suppliers. The originality of the plants was confirmed by a botanist. Plants were washed
and dried to be powder by shredder considering the sterility. Powders were kept in special packages
containing 3000 mg of herbal supplements (0.5 gram black myrobalans, 1 gram mastic, 1.5 grams
sugarcane), which were given to patients evening and night before sleep. Based on the TIM guidance, the
medication should be used sublingually and the patient had not to try swallow or chew it first but had to
allow saliva to be secreted and mixed with it and gradually swallow it. Failure to pay attention to this
issue causes nausea in the patient based on TIM. It should be noted that drinking water with this
supplement and even up to an hour after taking it was forbidden due to the reduced effectiveness of the
drug with water, so we ask the patient to help us in this matter.

130

Control group:

131
132
133
134

The Control group was planned to receive a placebo and the treatment protocol approved by the Ministry
of Health of Iran during the period of hospitalization. Placebo was shape, size, and color-matched with
the main supplement in the intervention group. It was made of bran and barley powder (for color
matching).

Based on the randomization outcome declared by the lead nurse, the administration of herbal supplements
in the intervention group, and placebo in the control group were performed by nurses. The researchers and
nurses did not realize the randomization results and the type of package provided to the patient. The
researcher only provided the supplement and placebo to the head nurse, in the same form of packaging.

All patients were compared in terms of demographic variables, vital signs, clinical and laboratory
variables. Demographic characteristics included: age, gender, Body mass index (BMI), history of
smoking, occupation. Critical indicators including temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure,
heart rate, arterial blood oxygen saturation, and respiration rate were examined and recorded daily in both
groups. The averaged vital sign values and daily values were compared. Vital sign of each day was
recorded three times a day, including temperature (C), blood pressure (mmHg), pulse rate (beats per
minute), respiratory rate (beats per minute), blood oxygen saturation (percent). Clinical characteristics
including symptoms (Cough, Dyspnea, Myalgia, Fatigue, sputum discharge, Rhinorrhea, and Headache)
were assessed daily with a designed questionnaire. In this questionnaire, the patient first determines the
presence of these symptoms at the beginning of the disease and finally choose one of the options (It got
much better, It got better, It didn't change, It got worse, and It got much worse); symptoms tracks were
recorded for each of these symptoms. Laboratory indices were performed in the first to seventh days of
hospitalization. Laboratory indicators included: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international
normalized ratio (INR), Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), white blood cells (WBCs), red blood
cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HB), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte counts.

Data analysis:

158
159
160

Data analysis was performed by descriptive statistics indicators (frequency, percentage, mean and
standard deviation) and inferential statistical tests (Chi-square, ANOVA, and Repeated measurement)
using SPSS software version 21. The significance level was considered P <0.05.

In this study, 72 patients with COVID-19, divided into intervention (n = 37) and control (n = 35) groups
were studied. There were 17 (48.6%) male subjects in the control and 19 (51.4%) male subjects in the
intervention group. The results of statistical analysis showed that the intervention and control groups had
not any significant difference in terms of age, sex, BMI, smoking history, and occupation (P>0.05),
(Table 1).

Time to symptom disappearance was assessed for the major symptoms. The time-to-event analysis
revealed a statistically significant difference in 4 symptoms of cough, fever, dyspnea, and myalgia (figure
1). where median rate ratio of the cough disappearance in intervention group versus control group was
0.285 (CI95%:0.173- 0.427; P<0.05); rate ratio of the fever disappearance was 0.5 (CI95%:0.271 - 0.921;
P<0.05); rate ratio of the dyspnea disappearance was 0.285 (CI95%:0.169 - 0.480; P<0.05); and it was
0.333 (CI95%:0.185 - 0.598; P<0.05) for myalgia disappearance (table 2). Detailed analysis of daily
change in all symptoms is reported in supplementary table S1.

An evaluation of patients’ condition, daily vital signs were recorded and averaged value of vital signs
were compared between two groups. There wasn’t any significant difference in terms of averaged O2
Saturation, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse rate (PR), and respiratory
rate (RR) between the two groups (P>0.05), as shown in table 3. Daily vital signs are shown in table S2.

179
180
181

The trend of C-reactive protein in the group receiving herbal supplements decreased from the first to the
fourth day, but then increased from the fourth to the fifth day, and then decreased until the seventh day.
But the control group in comparison to the intervention group had a significantly lower decrease in CRP
in 7 days (P<0.05).

182
183
184
185

The mean number of hospitalization days in patients in the herbal supplement group was significantly
lower than the patients in the control group. Patients in the herbal supplement group were hospitalized for
4.12 days and patients in the control group were hospitalized for 8.37 days (Table 4). ICU admission and
death only happened in 3 (8.6%) patients of the control group.

The results of this study showed that the addition of the proposed supplement (the combination of
sugarcane, black myrobalan, and mastic) along with the treatment protocol of the Ministry of Health, can
shorten the duration of treatment in patients with new coronavirus and relieve symptoms. While this study
is the first study using this combination; no further studies with the same methodology and treatment
method were available for comparison. Also, none of the herbs used in our combination was investigated
in other studies as a treatment for COVID-19, except a clinical trial study in Iran, in which Anacyclus
pyrethrum, Senna, Ferrula asafoetida, and Terminalia chebula effect have been planed to be tested on the
COVID19 patients, but the study results are not yet reported. One of the main findings of this study was
medication safety, as no subject showed any adverse events. This will help us to perform studies in a
higher number of the patient or other groups of patients with more severe disease, underlying disease, and
other age groups. The observed effects of the combination of sugarcane, black myrobalan, and mastic
could be explained by the herb’s ingredients. In a 2008 study by Gupta et al. (2008), a randomized
double-blind clinical trial of 60 febrile patients using aspirin (60 mg/kg body weight per day) as a
standard drug compared with the use of sugarcane plant was done. this trial showed that fever after oral
administration of sugarcane at a dose of 60 mg decreased rapidly and significantly, and this effect on
fever was more stable and significant than aspirin. This may be the reason for the sooner fever control in
our intervention group. But we were not able to monitor conventional antipyretic use in these patients and

as a confounding factor, this was a limitation of our study; while for fever control, all patients had the
same physician medical order.

The active ingredients of black myrobalan are terpenoids, carotenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, and
glycosides (Vemuri et al., 2019). In studies, this plant has been mentioned as a rich flavonoid plant
(Sharma et al., 2019). While we did not have the opportunity of chemical constituent compounds analysis
of herbs; previous administrations of black myrobalan were shown to be safe in humans. AyuFlex herbal,
manufactured by Natreon Inc., New Jersey, USA, is a US FDA approved black myrobalan supplement
(Murali et al., 2007). Black myrobalan has antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial activity due to
containing a variety of molecules. Black myrobalan has been reported to be an effective antiviral agent
against swine flu type A, HSV-1, HIV-1 has been reported in various studies (Lopez et al., 2017; Ma et
al., 2010). Other molecules in this plant are gallic acid and 3-glycol glucose molecules that inhibit the
process of HIV-1 integration (Yukawa et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2001; Ardekani et al., 2011) and thus
prevent viral infection without any side effects. Black myrobalan extract is effective in inhibiting the
division of cytomegalovirus and is useful in people with immune deficiencies (Ahn et al., 2002; Nosalova
et al., 2013; aik et al., 2004); The effect of using Black myrobalan has been shown against Respiratory
syncytial virus, Hepatitis C virus, Herpes simplex virus, and Dengue virus (Jagtap et al., 1999). It also
eliminates salivary bacteria by inhibiting the glycolysis pathway (Jagtap et al., 1999). Anti-inflammatory
effects and improvement of asthma symptoms have been reported in the use of Terminalia chebula fruit
extract. Animal studies showed that it can relieve cough even better than Codein, a confirmed medication
for the cough (Nosalova et al., 2013; aik et al., 2004; Jagtap et al., 1999). Also, it's anticaries properties
may be as protection against tooth damage from daily sugarcane use, if the medication is going to be used
for long periods (Sharma et al., 2011). But this hypothesis needs to be evaluated in further studies.

Pistacia lentiscus resina (mastics), the other component of our supplement, have antibacterial activity
(Abidi et al., 2016), prevents inflammation due to its Linalool content (Shin et al., 2001). Studies show
that mastics prevents the production of pro-inflammatory substances such as nitroxide and prostaglandin
2 (inhibition of cyclooxygenase 2 at mRNA and protein levels); Therefore, it is known as an antiinflammatory and antioxidant substance (Peana et al., 2002; Mahmoudi et al., 2010). In laboratory studies
on animal models, it has been shown that mastic plant can be effective in improving pulmonary fibrosis.
the use of this plant extract in an animal model of asthma reduced airway inflammation by reducing the
expression levels of TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-5, and improved pulmonary inflammation (Zhou et al., 2009).
TNF-α is known to have potential activity in the cytokine storm, caused by COVID-19(GiamarellosBourboulis et al., 2020).

236

Study limitations:

237
238
239

Our study had some limitations. First due to a low number of subjects. Critically ill patients were not
evaluated in this study. Also, patients with the underlying disease were excluded. Further researches
could be conducted on these populations as no significant severe effect was recorded.

240

Conclusion:

241
242
243

The proposed combination of Sugarcane, Black Myrobalan, and Mastic seems to be effective in the
symptom treatment and reducing the length of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Also, its safety was
confirmed.

244

Conflict of interest: None.
