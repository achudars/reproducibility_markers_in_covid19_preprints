Key Points

32

Question: What epidemiological characteristics and risk factors are associated with household and

33

non-household transmissions of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in

34

China outside of Hubei Province?

35

Findings: In this epidemiological study analyzing 1,407 SARS-CoV-2 infection events reported

36

between 20 January 2020 and 19 February 2020, 643 transmission clusters were reconstructed to

37

demonstrate the non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events, short duration of serial intervals,

38

and a higher risk of being infected outside of household for male people of age between 18 and 64

39

years.

40

Meaning: These findings provide epidemiological features and risk estimates for both household and

41

non-household transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in China outside of Hubei Province.

43

Abstract

44

Importance Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city of

45

Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread globally. Limited information is available for

46

characterizing epidemiological features and transmission patterns in the regions outside of Hubei

47

Province. Detailed data on transmission at the individual level could be an asset to understand the

48

transmission mechanisms and respective patterns in different settings.

49

Objective To reconstruct infection events and transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2 for estimating

50

epidemiological characteristics at household and non-household settings, including super-spreading

51

events, serial intervals, age- and gender-stratified risks of infection in China outside of Hubei Province.

52

Design, Setting, and Participants 9,120 confirmed cases reported online by 264 Chinese urban Health

53

Commissions in 27 provinces from January 20 to February 19, 2020. A line-list database is established

54

with detailed information on demographic, social and epidemiological characteristics. The infection

55

events are categorized into the household and non-household settings.

56

Exposures Confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

57

Main Outcomes and Measures Information about demographic characteristics, social relationships,

58

travel history, timelines of potential exposure, symptom onset, confirmation, and hospitalization were

59

extracted from online public reports. 1,407 infection events formed 643 transmission clusters were

60

reconstructed.

61

Results In total 34 primary cases were identified as super spreaders, and 5 household super-spreading

62

events were observed. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 4.95 days (standard deviation: 5.24

63

days) and 5.19 days (standard deviation: 5.28 days) for households and non-household transmissions,

64

respectively. The risk of being infected outside of households is higher for age groups between 18 and

65

64 years, whereas the hazard of being infected within households is higher for age groups of young

66

(<18) and elderly (>65) people.

67

Conclusions and Relevance The identification of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a

68

higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of age between 18 and 64 indicate a

69

significant barrier to the case identification and management, which calls for intensive non-

70

pharmaceutical interventions (e.g. cancellation of public gathering, limited access of public services) as

71

the potential mitigation strategies.

Introduction

87

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-

88

2) emerged in Wuhan city of Hubei Province in China. World Health Organization (WHO) announced

89

a public health emergency of international significance on 30 January 2020 1 and classified the threat as

90

a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 2. More than 118,326 confirmed cases and 4,292 deaths have

91

been reported as of 11 March 2020. The majority of cases in China (67,773) were from Hubei

92

Province3.

93

On 23 January 2020, China raised the national emergency response to the highest level, triggered an

94

unprecedented travel ban starting from the lockdown of Wuhan on 23 January, and 14 cities nearby

95

Wuhan on 24 January, and more than 30 provinces thereafter (Figure 1a). Although this countrywide

96

travel lockdown was aimed to interrupt case exportations from the epicenter, we have estimated 130

97

(95% CrI: 190, 369) high-risk cities that have introduced SARS-CoV-2 cases prior to Wuhan’s

98

lockdown 4. Recent studies5,6 report similar estimates for the rapid geographic expansion of SARS-

99

CoV-2. These coincide with the frequent reporting of infection events in China outside of Hubei

100

Province during the three weeks following Wuhan’s lockdown (Figure 1c).

101

Since the last week of January 2020, more than 260 Chinese cities have implemented intensive non-

102

pharmaceutical controls (Figure 1b), which brought the epidemic under control 7,8,9. However, as of 19

103

February 2020, this epidemic still has caused >10,000 cases in China outside of Hubei Province. To

104

enhance public health preparedness and public awareness, Chinese health authorities have publicly

105

reported detailed records of confirmed cases since 20 January 2020. This provides a unique resource

106

and an opportunity for understanding the transmission patterns, routes, and risk factors of the COVID-

107

19 epidemic.

108

Methods

109

Data Collection

110

In China, 27 provincial and 264 urban health commissions have publicly posted 9,120 confirmed case

111

reports online since 20 January 2020, which comprises 72.7% of all cases confirmed in China outside

112

of Hubei Province by 19 February (Table S9). We compiled a line-list database from these reports with

113

extracted demographic characteristics, social relationships, travel history, timelines of potential

114

exposure, symptom onset, confirmation and hospitalization. We obtained the daily population

115

movement data in China between 1 January and 13 February 2020 from Baidu Qianxi Web Portal

116

(https://qianxi.baidu.com/). We estimated the daily number of passengers leaving each province by

117

using the migration scale index for moving out of that province each day. More details on our real-time

118

mobility and line-list case data are provided in Supplemental Material and will be available at our

119

GitHub.

120

Statistical Analysis

121

We identified 1,407 infection events with known social relationships. For each infection event, we term

122

the infector the primary case and the infectee the secondary case. We also consider connected chains of

123

confirmed cases; we term the original case the index and the entire chain of cases, including the index,

124

the transmission cluster (Figure 2a).

125

We stratify infection events by household versus non-household transmissions, where household

126

includes any infection event among members within the same family (e.g., between parents and

127

children), and non-household include all others (e.g. colleagues, classmates). The numbers of

128

household (662) and non-household (745) infection events are almost even.

129

For each infection event with known symptom onset timelines, we compute the serial interval, i.e., the

130

number of days between the reported symptom onset date for the primary case and that for the

131

secondary case. We estimate the distribution of serial intervals by fitting a normal distribution to 679

132

infection events with known serial intervals (Supplemental Material).

133

The age-stratified hazard of infection for household relative to non-household contacts is estimated by

134

the ratio between the probability that a secondary case of age group b was infected by a primary case of

135

age group a within the same household and the probability that a secondary case of age group b was

136

infected by a primary case of age group a outside of households. Gender-specific hazard of infection is

137

measured similarly (Supplemental Material).

138

Results

139

We reconstructed 643 transmission clusters from 1,407 infection events (Figure 2a). The sizes of 587

140

transmission clusters are smaller than 5, whereas the size of the largest cluster exceeds 20. We

141

observed 34 primary cases acting as super spreaders. Stratification by household shows that 356, 92,

142

and 34 primary cases infected only 1 member, 2 members, and at least 3 familial members within

143

households, respectively; 276, 78, and 75 primary cases infected 1, 2, and at least 3 secondary cases

144

outside households, respectively (Figure 2b). Only 5 household super-spreading events were observed.

145

The mean serial interval is estimated to be 4.95 days (standard deviation: 5.24 days) within households,

146

and 5.19 days (standard deviation: 5.28 days) for non-household transmissions. Notably, 26 of 339

147

household- and 29 of 340 non-household infection events reported negative-valued serial intervals,

148

implying pre-symptomatic transmission.

149

The hazard of being infected within households is higher for age groups of young (<18) and elderly

150

(>65) people, whereas the hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age groups

151

between 18 and 64 years (Table 1a). Primary cases of elderly (>65) people are more prone to cause

152

household infections. Hazard of infection between different genders is higher for households than non-

153

household transmission (Table 1b).

154

Discussion

155

We reconstructed 1,407 infection events formed 643 transmission clusters from 9,120 COVID-19 cases

156

confirmed in China outside of Hubei Province as of 19 February 2020. The entire database will be

157

available at our GitHub.

158

Although super-spreading events have been reported by media reports and a recent study 11 which

159

focuses on special settings (e.g., restaurant, chalet) before February 2020, systematic analyses with a

160

sufficiently large sample size is lacking. Here, we identified 34 primary cases classified as super-

161

spreader. Majority of the super-spreading events involve more non-household transmissions than

162

household transmissions. This indicates the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.

163

cancellation of public gatherings, limited access of public services) as the potential mitigation

164

strategies (see Table S2).

165

Household study helps identify risk factors for certain demographic groups 12. The age-stratified and

166

gender-specific hazard of infection suggests a higher risk of infection within households for age groups

167

of young (<18) and elderly (>65) and female people. The higher risk of being infected outside of

168

households for male people of age between 18 and 64 years indicates their role in driving household

169

secondary infections in the households included in our data, perhaps because these were travelers from

170

Wuhan of working age.

171

We identified 55 infection events (~4%) with the secondary case reporting symptom onset prior to the

172

primary case, which is consistent with our preliminary analysis 4 and recent clinical reports 13,14.

173

Negative-valued serial intervals indicate the potential occurrence of pre-symptomatic transmissions.

174

We estimate that the mean serial interval is ~5 days for both household and non-household infections,

175

which is considerably shorter than the mean serial interval estimated for SARS (e.g., 8.4 days 15) and

176

MERS (e.g. 7.6 days 16). These evidences impose a significant barrier to case identification and

177

management.

178

Our findings have several limitations. First, the size of each household and the primary cases without

179

secondary infections are unknown from original disclosures. This may give biased estimates if we

180

estimate the household reproduction number and secondary attack rate from raw data. Field surveys

181

will be helpful to adjust biases. Second, the information on nosocomial infections is unknown from

182

original disclosures, so that the observation of super-spreading events may be less common from our

183

dataset.

estimated by the mean daily number of passengers moving out of that province between 3 January

280

2020 and 9 January 2020 (i.e., the last week prior to the start of the Spring Festival travel season). The

relative change in outbound travel volume of province i on a given date Ti is measured by the ratio

282

between the estimated number of passengers moving out of province i on date Ti and the baseline daily

283

outbound travel volume of province i. Each row denotes a province, with Hubei Province highlighted

284

in red. Columns from left to right are ordered by calendar days. For the color bar, the dark red and blue

285

indicate a significant decrease and increase in the outbound travel volume, respectively. The Spring

286

Festival travel season officially started on 10 January 2020. The Lunar New Year holiday started on 25

287

January 2020 and was extended to 8 February 2020. The lockdown of Wuhan started on 23 January

Figure 2: COVID-19 transmission clusters. (a) 643 transmission clusters, stratified by the size of

297

cluster n. Red, green and blue nodes denote primary cases, household secondary cases and non-

298

household secondary cases, respectively. (b) Distribution of the number of secondary infections caused

299

by each of the 809 primary cases. (c) Distribution of serial intervals, which is fitted to 679 infection

300

events with known symptom onset timelines. For household transmissions, fitting with a normal

301

distribution suggests a mean serial interval of 4.95 days (standard deviation: 5.24 days); for non-

302

household transmissions, fitting with a normal distribution suggests a mean serial interval of 5.19 days

303

(standard deviation: 5.28 days). Alternative distributions fitted for the serial interval can be found in

304

Table S5.

Table 1: Hazard of infection stratified by age or gender. (a) Age-stratified hazard of infection for

308

the household relative to non-household transmission. (b) Gender-specific hazard of infection for the

309

household relative to non-household transmission. Red or blue shades indicate an increased or

310

decreased hazard of infection within households relative to outside of households, respectively.
