Abstract
Thrombotic and thromboembolic complications have been shown to play a critical role in the
clinical outcome of COVID-19. Emerging evidence has shown that exosomal miRNAs are
functionally involved in a number of physiologic and pathologic processes. However, neither
exosomes nor miRNAs have been hitherto investigated in COVID-19. To test the hypothesis
that exosomal miRNAs are a key determinant of thrombosis in COVID-19, we enrolled patients
positive for COVID-19. Circulating exosomes were isolated from equal amounts of serum and
levels of exosomal miRNAs were quantified. We divided our population in two groups based on
the serum level of D-dimer on admission. Strikingly, we found that exosomal miR-424 was
significantly upregulated whereas exosomal miR-103a, miR-145, and miR-885 were significantly
downregulated in patients in the high D-dimer group compared to patients in the low D-Dimer
group (p<0.0001).

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a public health crisis of global proportions caused by the
severe

acute

respiratory

syndrome

coronavirus

2

(SARS-CoV-2).

Thrombotic

and

thromboembolic complications have been shown to play a critical role in the clinical outcome of
COVID-19 (1-4).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that enhance mRNA degradation and/or
inhibit protein translation (5,6). Emerging evidence has shown that exosomal miRNAs are
functionally involved in a number of physiologic and pathologic processes (5,7,8).

However, neither exosomes nor miRNAs have been hitherto investigated in COVID-19.

Methods
To test the hypothesis that exosomal miRNAs are a key determinant of thrombosis in COVID19, we enrolled 26 patients positive for COVID-19 admitted to the Infectious Disease
Departments of University of Naples “Vanvitelli” and San Sebastiano Caserta Hospital (Italy).
The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles and approved by
the local Ethical Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Circulating exosomes were isolated from equal amounts of serum, as previously described and
validated by our group (9,10) and levels of exosomal miRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR,
normalizing values to spiked cel-miR-39 (10).

We divided our population in two groups based on the serum level of D-dimer on admission,
using a previously published cut-off of 3 μg/ml (4).

Results and Discussion
No significant differences in the main clinical characteristics were noted comparing patients with
low (n=11, 72.7% male) vs high (n=15, 53.3% male) D-Dimer: age (59.7±22.7 vs 68.6±10.7),
body mass index (27.3±2.3 vs 26.56±2.1 kg/m2), and hypertension (63.3% vs 66.7%).

Strikingly, we found a that exosomal miR-424 was significantly upregulated whereas exosomal
miR-103a, miR-145, and miR-885 were significantly downregulated (Figure 1, A-D) in patients
in the high D-dimer group compared to patients in the low D-Dimer group (p<0.0001).
Regression analysis confirmed these findings (Figure 1, E-H).

Mechanistically, Tissue Factor has been identified as a direct target of miR-145, while miR-885
has been shown to target the von Willebrand Factor (5,11). Equally important, miR-424 has
been associated with hypercoagulability whereas low levels of miR-103a have been observed in
deep vein thrombosis (5,12), although precise mechanisms have not been fully defined for
these miRNAs.

To our knowledge, this is the first study showing a functional contribution of exosomal noncoding RNA in COVID19. Limitations of our study include the relatively small population and the
fact that we did not determine the exact source of exosomes; nevertheless, since endothelial
dysfunction has been shown to be a prominent feature of COVID-19 and to contribute to the
pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory state of the vasculature (2), we speculate that a main
source could be represented by endothelial cells, which express these miRNAs in normal
conditions (5).
