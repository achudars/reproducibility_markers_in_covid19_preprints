Abstract
BACKGROUND
Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are
commonly used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation but have been associated with
complications in community acquired pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections (RTIs).
Conclusive data are not available about potential beneficial or adverse effects of COX inhibitors
on COVID-19 patients.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective, multi-center observational study by leveraging the harmonized,
high-granularity electronic health record data of the National COVID Cohort Collaborative
(N3C). Potential associations of eight COX inhibitors with COVID-19 severity were assessed
using ordinal logistic regression (OLR) on treatment with the medication in question after
matching by treatment propensity as predicted by age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status,
comorbidities, and BMI. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the correlation
of medication use with morbidity for eight subcohorts defined by common indications for COX
inhibitors.
RESULTS
OLR revealed statistically significant associations between use of any of five COX inhibitors and
increased severity of COVID-19. For instance, the odds ratio of aspirin use in the osteoarthritis
cohort (n=2266 patients) was 3.25 (95% CI 2.76 - 3.83). Aspirin and acetaminophen were
associated with increased mortality.
CONCLUSIONS
The association between use of COX inhibitors and COVID-19 severity was consistent across
five COX inhibitors and multiple indication subcohorts. Our results align with earlier reports
associating NSAID use with complications in RTI patients. Further research is needed to
characterize the precise risk of individual COX inhibitors in COVID-19 patients.

As of 3 April 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2) has infected more than 128 million people and caused more than 2.8 million deaths
worldwide.1 SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), a
condition characterized by pneumonia, hyperinflammation, hypoxemic respiratory failure, a
prothrombotic state, cardiac dysfunction, substantial mortality, and persistent morbidity in some
survivors.2
Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors represent a large and heterogeneous class of medications
defined by their ability to inhibit COX, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic
acid to prostaglandins. The two COX isoforms differ in their distribution and physiologic roles.
COX-1 is ubiquitously and constitutively expressed and produces prostaglandins implicated in
homeostatic functions such as maintenance of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal integrity. Many of
the adverse effects of conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including
GI bleeding, peptic ulceration, hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident, renal impairment,
wheezing, and rash) are thought to be primarily related to inhibition of COX-1. In contrast, COX2 is induced by cytokines and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain and inflammation.3
Due to their widespread use, NSAIDs are common causes of serious adverse events that
frequently necessitate hospitalization.4
NSAIDs have numerous potentially deleterious effects on immune function and may also mask
warning signs of severe infection such as fever and pain during the course of communityacquired pneumonia. NSAID exposure in the early stage of community-acquired pneumonia has
been associated with a delayed diagnosis and more severe clinical course,5,6 but the quality of
available research has been called into doubt and recent studies have failed to reproduce the
proposed association.7,8 Some NSAIDs have been associated with abnormalities of immune
function.9,10 Here, we investigate seven NSAIDs and acetaminophen, which has COX-2
inhibitory and other pharmacological activities.11 For conciseness, we will refer to the group of
NSAIDs and acetaminophen as COX inhibitors.

Existing evidence regarding the effect on COVID-19 of exposure to COX inhibitors is
inconclusive. Indomethacin has a direct antiviral effect against the SARS-CoV virus,12 and a
clinical trial to assess the effects of adding naproxen to the treatment of critically ill patients
hospitalized for COVID-19 infection is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04325633).
On the other hand, an apparent increase in the severity of clinical symptoms was noted in
French COVID-19 patients taking ibuprofen.7 In the early months of the pandemic, a study was
conducted with data from OpenSAFELY, a secure health analytics platform that covers 40% of
all patients in England. The study ran from 1 March 2020 to 14 June 2020, looking at two
(partially overlapping) cohorts: 2,463,707 patients in the general population with a history of
NSAID use, and 1,708,781 patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. In
both cohorts, the treatment group was defined as all patients who were prescribed NSAIDs
within 4 months of the study's start date; all others were considered controls. The primary
outcome was COVID-19 related death: no significant increase in mortality was shown in the
treatment group of either cohort.13 Other small cohort studies ranging in size from 293 to 1222
patients failed to show increased risks with use of various NSAIDs.14–17 An observational study
on 98 patients who had received aspirin within 24 hours of admission or 7 days before
admission compared to 314 patients who had not received aspirin showed significant
associations of aspirin use with decreased severity and mortality of COVID-19.18
Given the common use of COX inhibitors and the inconclusiveness of these prior studies,
additional insight on potential risks of COX inhibitor use by COVID-19 patients is needed. Our
research leverages data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a centralized,
harmonized, high-granularity electronic health record (EHR) repository with the largest, most
representative U.S. cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls to date. We assessed associations
of eight COX inhibitors with clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients, demonstrating
significant associations of five COX-inhibitors with increased COVID-19 severity and in two
cases, mortality.

Methods

STUDY POPULATION

All patient data were accessed through the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)
(covid.cd2h.org). N3C aggregates and harmonizes EHR data across 38 clinical organizations in
the United States, including the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program
hubs. For this analysis, data were derived from the 24 centers that provided data for all
predictors used in the regression analysis described below. Fourteen centers did not provide
data on Body Mass Index (BMI) and were not included in this study. N3C harmonizes data
across four clinical data models and provides a unified analytical platform in which data are
encoded using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)19 version 5.3.1 and
provides shared phenotype definitions such as those for positive COVID-19 laboratory tests and
COVID-19 clinical severity categories.20,21
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

Criteria for the current study were determined as follows. The COVID-19 positive cohort
(Supplemental Table S1) was defined as those patients with any encounter after January 1,
2020 and positive SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test (polymerase chain reaction or antigen). For this
study, data from up to February 2, 2021 were included. For each medication, we defined
subcohorts based on an indication for use of one of eight COX inhibitors (acetaminophen,
aspirin, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketorolac, meloxicam, naproxen) that were neither sexspecific nor limited to pediatric age groups on the basis of information in the DrugCentral
resource.22 Subcohorts of COVID-19 patients who had a history of that indication prior to
contracting COVID-19 were identified, as determined by a condition era23 that began before the
date of COVID-19 diagnosis. A treatment group within the subcohort was defined as patients
whose drug era23 for the medication in question began on or before the date of COVID-19

diagnosis and continued for at least one day. All other patients from the subcohort were used in
propensity matching to define the control group. A secondary analysis was performed on all
patients receiving the COX inhibitor regardless of indication.
Only patients with complete records (no missing values for any covariate used in propensity
matching or logistic regression) were included for further analysis. We studied the drugindication combinations for which there were at least 50 treated patients. OMOP concept ID
codes for all drugs and drug indications used in this analysis are listed in Supplemental Tables
S2 and S3.

OUTCOMES

The primary outcome of interest was the COVID-19 clinical severity category. Clinical severity
was classified into five categories using the Clinical Progression Scale (CPS) established by the
World Health Organization (WHO) for COVID-19 clinical research24: “mild” (outpatient, WHO
severity 1-3); “mild ED” (outpatient with ED visit, WHO severity 3); “moderate” (hospitalized
without invasive ventilation, WHO severity 4-6); “severe” (hospitalized with invasive ventilation
or ECMO, WHO severity 7-9); and “mortality/hospice” (hospital mortality or discharge to
hospice, WHO Severity 10).21 For the purposes of the ordinal logistic regression (OLR) analysis
described below, patients were assigned to severity groups according to the maximum clinical
severity during their index encounter,21 which was defined as the medical encounter during
which a positive COVID-19 test was documented for the first time. Secondary outcomes were
all-cause mortality recorded at any time following the COVID-19 diagnosis as well as analyses
of the entire groups of COVID-19 patients treated with the medications of interest without
restriction to indications.

STUDY DESIGN

For each of the eight COX Inhibitors, we constructed a codeset containing concept IDs
representing all formulations of the medications (see Supplemental Table S3) using ATLAS
(http://atlas-covid19.ohdsi.org/), the graphical user interface for the OMOP common data
model.25
We explored the potential association between treatment with a pharmaceutical agent and
severity of COVID-19. Two strategies were chosen to minimize the potential effects of
confounding. To control for confounding due to covariate imbalance, we compared outcomes in
a propensity-matched group of patients who had an indication associated with the COX inhibitor
of interest. This resulted in subchorts of relatively homogeneous patient clusters. Propensity
score matching was performed to correct residual covariate imbalance within these subcohorts.
Using the DrugCentral resource22, we developed the following list of representative indications:
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, angina pectoris, migraine, myocardial infarction, pain,
headache, and fever (OMOP concept id codes in Supplemental Table S2).19 Figure 1
summarizes the procedure used to define the aspirin-osteoarthritis subcohort; other subcohorts
were defined analogously.

“mortality/hospice”.21 We assessed the relationship between COVID-19 severity and treatment
with each medication under consideration as a part of multiple OLR with age, race, ethnicity,
gender, smoking status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and BMI as additional predictors. For
treatment with the medication we recorded the t value, the corresponding p value, and the odds
ratio along with its 95% confidence interval.
Cox proportional hazards modeling
A single index encounter was defined for each laboratory-confirmed positive patient as
described previously.21 Survival time was defined with respect to this encounter. For each
patient, the latest visit and date of death (if observed) was recorded to measure right censoring
(the last date for which death outcome can be ruled out) and survival, respectively. The survival
R package was used to produce Kaplan-Meier survival curves, compute Cox proportional
hazards regression using the same predictors as with OLR, and visualize Schoenfeld residuals.

RESULTS
We evaluated 250,533 patients with COVID-19 in a retrospective cohort study. Mean age was
41.6 years, and 115,828 patients (46.2%) were men. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used
to account for comorbidities,26 and the Clinical Progression Scale (CPS) established by the
World Health Organization (WHO) for COVID-19 clinical research was used to stratify patients
according to severity.24 A total of 6138 deaths were recorded in the COVID-19 cohort (1.9%).
Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the demographics of the cohort.
We evaluated eight COX inhibitors. For each medication, we chose one or more representative
indications with at least 50 cases, collected all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who
additionally had been diagnosed with the representative drug indication, and then divided this
cohort into individuals treated with the medication (cases) and those who were not (controls).
We reasoned that this would define more balanced case and control groups than if we
compared all COVID-19 patients who were receiving the medication with those who were not,

since medication use is a proxy for the distribution of comorbidities, some of which may
correlate strongly with COVID-19 outcome. To further reduce the effect of confounders, we
performed propensity matching27 to match drug-treated and untreated patients according to age,
race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and BMI. Table 1 shows a
representative cohort before and after propensity matching.

Table 1. Aspirin-treated osteoarthritis subcohort. SMD: standardized mean difference.

OLR was performed to assess the relationship between use of the candidate medication and
other covariates (age, race, ethnicity, gender, smoking status, Charlson comorbidity, and BMI)
and COVID-19 severity (“mild”, “mild ED”, “moderate”, “severe”, “mortality/hospice”). Sixteen of
the 21 cohort comparisons indicated a significant association of COX inhibitor use with
increased COVID-19 severity (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the distribution of severity classes in
osteoarthritis cohorts for aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, as well as the distribution of
severity classes in the entire COVID-19+ cohort for aspirin. In agreement with previous
studies28,29, we also consistently observed a significant association of age, male sex, and
Charlson comorbidity with COVID-19 severity (Supplemental Table S1 - S21). OLR relies on an
assumption of proportional odds, which we verified is tenable for these data (Supplemental
Figure S22). We calculated the E-value for the observed values of the odds ratio to assess the
sensitivity of our findings to uncorrected confounders.30 The observed odds ratio of 3.3 for the
association of aspirin with increased COVID-19 severity in the aspirin-osteoarthritis subcohort
could not be explained away by an unmeasured confounder that was associated with both the
treatment and the outcome by a odds ratio of less than 3.0-fold each above and beyond the
confounders included in the regression. E-values for other subcohorts are shown in
Supplemental Table S4.

mortality. Supplemental Tables S21-S60 and Supplemental Figures S1-S25 show detailed
results. Comparable results were obtained by analyzing the entire cohort of COVID-19 per
medication (Supplemental Figures S23-S31 and Tables S47-S62).
Discussion
Our findings show an association of COX inhibitors with increased COVID-19 severity across
five of the eight tested agents (aspirin, ibuprofen, ketorolac, naproxen, and acetaminophen).
Diclofenac, meloxicam, and celecoxib did not show significant associations with severity in our
study. Interestingly, these three agents display selectivity for COX-2.31
COX-2 selective inhibitors were developed with the goal of avoiding the adverse GI effects
associated with non-selective NSAIDs, but were found to be associated with a higher risk of
cardiovascular adverse events including stroke and myocardial infarction.32,33 Increased
cardiovascular risk was subsequently shown to be associated also with non-selective NSAIDs in
multiple studies.34
NSAIDs have multiple effects on the immune system, including inhibition of neutrophil
adherence, decreased neutrophil degranulation and oxidant production, inhibition of neutrophil
elastase activity and induction of neutrophil apoptosis, and inhibition of antibody production.10,35
Several studies have documented an association between NSAID use and risk of severe
pulmonary complications in the setting of community acquired pneumonia and acute viral
infection.5 Other studies have failed to find an association of NSAIDs with a worse prognosis
among patients admitted with influenza.8 Conceivably, the increased risk could be related to
effects of NSAIDs on the immune system or to a delay in treatment related to the masking of
symptoms of infection by an NSAID.36 We did not observe an association of NSAID use with
neutrophil counts in COVID-19 patients (data not shown). Insufficient data was available to
assess other potential associations with immune cell function. Acetaminophen, which has a
mechanism of action different from that of NSAIDs, has previously been associated with
decreased mortality in critically ill patients.37 These considerations, together with isolated reports

of exacerbation of the clinical course of COVID-19 following ibuprofen exposure, have led to
recommendations against the use of ibuprofen for managing symptoms of COVID-19.38

Strengths and limitations of this study
Observational studies such as retrospective EHR cohort analysis are subject to confounding. In
the case of our study, the decision of whether to treat a patient with a COX inhibitor could in
principle be correlated with the outcome of interest (COVID-19 severity). We applied two
strategies to mitigate confounding: (i) analysis of subcohorts according to indication, and (ii)
propensity matching. However, in observational studies a risk of residual confounding persists
because the efficacy of propensity matching is limited to known and measured factors.
Exposure to the drugs of interest, most of which are available without a prescription, was likely
to be captured incompletely in the EHR data used in the analysis. Thus, it is possible that there
was unrecorded use of COX inhibitors in the untreated group.
Our study uses a five-level ordinal measure of COVID-19 outcome that may allow increased
sensitivity compared with some previous efforts that use only COVID-19 mortality to measure
outcome.

Conclusions
The many NSAIDs vary with respect to their ability to inhibit each isoenzyme (COX-1 and COX2). Aspirin shows the lowest degree of COX-2 selectivity, while celecoxib is one of the most
COX-selective NSAIDs.39 In addition, celecoxib possess activities unrelated to COX inhibition.40
Therefore, it appears plausible that the adverse effect profile of COX inhibitors in individuals
with COVID-19 may differ from medication to medication. The results of our observational study
demonstrated a significant association of the use of five of eight different COX inhibitors with
increased clinical severity and mortality. We did not find evidence for an association of
increased COVID-19 severity with diclofenac, meloxicam and celecoxib, which are selective for

COX-2,31 raising the possibility of agent-specific risk profiles for individual COX inhibitors.
Additionally, we demonstrate a significant association between COVID-19 severity and
acetaminophen use, which does not provide support for recent recommendations for
acetaminophen for symptom relief in COVID-19. While our findings suggest the importance for
clinicians to carefully consider which COX inhibitor to prescribe, additional research will be
required to confirm our results in other settings and to address the question of whether different
COX inhibitors have different adverse effect profiles in treating COVID-19.
