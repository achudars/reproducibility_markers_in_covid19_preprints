ABSTRACT
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population has caused a huge pandemic that is
still unfolding in many countries around the world. Multiple epicenters of the pandemic have emerged
since the first pneumonia cases in Wuhan, first in Italy followed by the USA and Brazil. Up to now,
Brazil is the second most affected country, however, genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains
circulating in the country are restricted to some highly impacted states. Although the Pernambuco
state, located in the Northeast Region, is the sixth most affected brazilian state and the second
considering lethality rate, there is a lack of high quality genomic sequences from the strains
circulating in this region. Here, we sequenced 38 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from patients presenting
Covid-19 symptoms. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that three lineages were circulating in the
state and 36 samples belong to B1.1 lineage. We detected two introductions from European countries
and five clades, corroborating the community spread of the virus between different municipalities of
the state. Finally, we detected that all except one strain showed the D614G spike protein amino acid
change that may impact virus infectivity in human cells. Our study brought new light to the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 strains in one of the most heavily impacted states of Brazil.

INTRODUCTION
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is caused by several viral pathogens that are
able to infect the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans leading to compromised oxygenation
and multiple organ failure ​[1]​. Influenza viruses, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses (CoV) are commonly
associated with SARS, although with a low incidence due to the worldwide influenza immunization
campaigns and the mild symptoms normally derived from infection of other respiratory viruses ​[2]​.
On the other hand, recently emerged respiratory viruses, which are able to sustain human-to-human
transmission, may infect a large proportion of the world human population, leading to devastating
pandemics in the absence of a vaccine and/or preventive measures to control its dissemination. For
example, the H1N1 virus infected more than 575 thousand people during the 2009 pandemic ​[3] and
two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 that emerged in 2002 and MERS-CoV, in 2012, infected thousands
of people. These last two viruses were not well adapted to human-to-human transmission and the
outbreaks came into control before massive human spread ​[4]
Viruses from the Coronaviridae family have a positive sense RNA genome ranging from 27 to
32 Kb in length and codify 16 non-structural and 4 structural proteins ​[5]​. These highly diverse
viruses are composed by at least five genuses (Alphaletovirus, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,
Deltacoronavirus and Gamacoronavirus) that are infectious to a myriad of vertebrates ​[6,7]​. Six
different coronaviruses from Alpha and Betacoronavirus genuses are known to infect humans, all of
them likely derived from wild and domestic animals ​[5,8]​. Studies suggest that four of these viruses
are associated with only mild symptoms in humans (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and
HKU1), while SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV show a high morbidity and mortality rate (MASTERS,
2006; SINGHAL, 2020). However, around December 2019 a new pneumonia-like illness was
reported in the Wuhan municipality in China (ZHOU et al., 2020). A few weeks later the genome of
the etiological agent was sequenced and revealed a new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 ​[9]​.
Different from the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is particularly well adapted to
sustained human-to-human transmission. It is highly infectious, spreading easily through symptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals ​[10]​. Due to widespread human mobility, this virus reached all
continents
in
less
than
3
months
after
the
reports
from
Wuhan
(​https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/​).
Such
a
pandemic is still unfolding and more than 15 million people were already infected by the virus, and
more than 600 thousand succumbed, highlighting that the human kind is facing the largest and more
challenging human pandemic of all times.
Since the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2, there were two well recognized epicenters of the
pandemic: Northern Italy that reported the peak of the epidemic around late March to mid April 2020
[11,12] followed by the United States of America (USA), which reached the first peak around April
2020, with most cases concentrating in the New York City area ​[13]​. Currently, the USA is the most
affected country in the world, accounting for almost five million infected people. Real time
epidemiological monitoring are showing that the numbers of new infected patients are decreasing in
some early affected states while increasing rapidly in later affected ones giving support to a second
wave
in
the
country
​[14]
(​https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html​,
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/​). On the other
hand, SARS-CoV-2 human infections have been increasing at a rapid pace in South America, led
mostly by Brazil - the most populous country of the continent with more than 211.8 million people
according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e
Estatística, IBGE - http://www.ibge.gov.br). The first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazil was reported

in February 25th 2020, and now (July 2020), Brazil is the second most affected country in the world,
only behind the US in the number of new cases and deaths ​[15] (​https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
- ​https://covid.saude.gov.br/​). Recent publications based on the sequencing and characterization of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Minas Gerais and São Paulo (southeast region of Brazil) revealed the
introduction of different SARS-CoV-2 lineages from European countries, which were associated with
recent travel history of the patients ​[16–18]​. Resende et al 2020 [19], sequenced 95 SARS-CoV-2
genomes from 10 brazilian states and Candido et al 2020 sequenced 427 genomes from 21 Brazilian
states and both identified more than 100 independent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil ​[19,20]​.
Pernambuco is the seventh most populous state in Brazil and the eighth state regarding the number of
infected patients with 101.395 confirmed cases, but the fourth in terms of deaths (6.828 deaths) and
the second considering lethality (6.7%) (last accessed August 8th 2020 - CIEVS PE https://www.cievspe.com/​). So far no genomic epidemiology study ​[21] was performed to sequence
SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes circulating in the state.
In this study, we sequenced 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Pernambuco state,
Northeastern Brazil during an early pandemic phase in order to evaluate the emergence and
community spread of this virus in one of the most affected states. We found that two introductions are
directly linked with European countries and substantial community spread contributed to the
dispersion of the virus to smaller cities in the state country-side.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Sampling and Molecular Detection
Samples were obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from symptomatic
patients from different ambulatory facilities in Pernambuco (Northeast Brazil). These samples are a
part of the COVID-19 biorepository from the Aggeu Magalhães Institute (IAM), a Oswaldo Cruz
Foundation (FIOCRUZ) unit. All standard operating procedures (SOPs) established by the World
Health Organization guidelines were employed (2020c). Rigorous biosafety measures were employed
as all samples were manipulated in the BSL-3 facility laboratory. RNA extractions were performed
using the robotic platform using the Maxwell​® 16 Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega,
Wisconsin-USA), following the manufacturer's protocol. The molecular detection was performed
using the Kit Molecular Bio Manguinhos SARS-CoV-2 (E/RP): a single-step reaction for detecting
the virus envelope gene (E) and the Ribonuclease P housekeeping control gene (RNAse P) ​[22]​.
Genomic sequencing
Total RNA was used for single strand cDNA generation using Platus Transcriber RNase HcDNA First Strand kit (​Sinapse inc)​ following manufacturer's instruction. cDNA generated was
subjected to multiplex PCR reactions using Q5 High Fidelity Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (New
England Biolabs) and a set of SARS-CoV-2 specific primers, designed by
(​https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-sequencing-protocol-bbmuik6w​). Cycling conditions were:
98ºC at 30 seconds, 98ºC at 15 seconds, 62ºC at 30 seconds and 65ºC at 5 minutes during 35 cycles.
Amplified PCR products were purified using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter) following
standard protocol and quantified using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Sequence libraries were prepared with Nextera XT Library Prep Kit
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 1.5 ng of PCR products following the manufacturer’s

instructions. Sequencing was performed in the MiSeq (Illumina) machine using MiSeq Reagent kit V3
of 150 cycles employing a paired-end strategy.
Genome Assembly and Annotation
Low quality raw sequencing reads and primers sequences were removed using Trimmomatic
0.36 with default parameters. Based on the knowledge that epidemic viruses sampled at short time
frames does not accumulate a substantial amount of mutations, we performed a reference-based
assembly strategy using the first published SARS-CoV-2 genome as reference (​NC_045512.2​) using
Bowtie2 software ​[23] with default parameters. Following, we generated a .bed file using samtools 1.5
[24] and genomeCoverageBed from bedtools v 2.15.0 ​[25] keeping only position with > 5x of
coverage. Lastly we used vcf-annotate (parameters --filter Qual=20/MinDP=100/SnpGap=20) and
vcf-consensus from vcftools v 0.1.13 ​[26]​ to generate the final consensus sequences.
The N regions and coverage values for each genome were plotted using karyoploteR ​[27] and
the annotation was performed with VAPiD ​[28]​, using the ​NC_045512.2 genome as reference. All in

Evolutionary Analysis
Nineteen thousand nine hundred and one public genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved
from GISAID (​https://www.gisaid.org/ - accessed in 23 May 2020), this number represents only
SARS-CoV-2 genomes identified in human samples tagged as complete and sequenced with high
coverage. Sequences with less than 29400 bp were removed with fasta_cleaner.py resulting in 16,645
genomes. These genomes and the 38 ones sequenced in our study were aligned with the reference
genome NC_045512.2 using MAFFT add v7.310 ​[29] with the --keep-length parameter. The resulted
alignment was edited in different ways to generate three datasets: I - The 3’ and 5’ ends were
removed according to ​[30]​; II - The gaps and homoplasic sites were masked according to
(​https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473​) with algn_mask.py and III Only the gaps and nucleotide positions with degenerated IUPAC bases were masked. Each alignment
was submitted to a clustering step using cd-hit-est ​[31] to remove redundancy with cluster_gisaid.py,
where sequences with 100% of identity from the same country at the nucleotide level were clustered
and only one representative genome were selected for further analyses. Such subsampling strategy
was necessary since the sequencing effort has been much more intense in some countries than others.
Still, after this first redundancy removal more than 3000 genomes remained for the USA and England.
Then a second round of redundancy removal was applied using a lower identity threshold (99.7%)
only for some countries (see Supplementary Material 1 - Sheet 1) in order to sample a similar number
of genomes available for the majority of the remaining countries (ranging from 153 to 194). It is
important to note that we kept all the information about clustered sequences and added them back to
the alignment if some of our sequences grouped with high branch support to one of the representative
sequences from the clusters in order to reduce any bias to the final phylogenetic reconstruction.
Finally, each alignment dataset was visualized and checked with Aliview ​[32] and these 3 alignments
were submitted to the following steps.
The SARS-CoV-2 lineages were assigned with pangolin (​https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/​) and the
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with IQ-TREE ​[33] using 1000 replicates of the bootstrap
ultrafast method ​[34]​. The evolutionary models were selected with the ModelFinder ​[35] for each

dataset. The best model of substitution, log likelihood values for each datasets is available on
(Supplementary Material 1 - Sheet 2). iTOL ​[36] was used to annotate the phylogenetic trees, the
annotation files were generated with itol_annot.py and pangolin_annot.py. Tree branches were
colored by continent and tip color ranges were colored by pangolin lineage, the root was set between
lineages A and B, as proposed by ​[30]​. After each tree reconstruction and annotation, the dataset that
generates the tree with best log-likelihood value, and a topology that converges with pangolin
annotation was selected and subsets of each clade containing IAM genomes were created to rerun
phylogenetic trees for each clade (Supplementary Material 1 - Sheet 2) with the same parameters of
the previous tree. After tree reconstructions, genomes from GISAID that are present on
highly-supported clades (branch support ≥ 90) with IAM genomes were separated to evaluate the
SNPs supporting each cluster. Information about collection date and travel history used in subsequent
analysis can be found in Supplementary Material 1 - Sheet 3.
For the Bayesian analysis, datasets with SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sampled by week with
gisaid_sampler.py and only sequences showing complete collection dates (year-moth-day) were kept.
One dataset was constructed comprising the lineages B + B1 from pangolin including all
SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in this study. After the ML reconstruction with IQ-TREE the tree
was evaluated in Tempest 1.5.3 ​[37] to check the root-to-tip temporal signal. Outlier sequences were
removed before the phylodynamics analysis performed in BEAST 1.10.4 ​[38]​. Bayesian
phylodynamic analyses were performed using either a strict clock applying a fixed mean clock rate of
0.8x10​-3 as used in other studies ​[13,39] or an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model. The
analyses were performed either using a constant, coalescent exponential growth or Skyline
demographic model as tree priors and GTR+F+I as nucleotide substitution model. The molecular
clock and demographic model were evaluated based on likelihood using Path
Sampling/Stepping-stone sampling. The final analysis was based on three independent runs of 100
million MCM generations sampling in every 10.000 steps using the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed
clock and coalescent exponential growth demographic model. The run convergence was evaluated
with Tracer 1.7 and all parameters showed ESS values > 200. The generated trees were combined
using LogCombiner applying a burn-in of 25% and the Maximum clade credibility tree was obtained
using the treeannotator. The time-scaled trees were visualized on Figtree 1.4.4.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism analysis
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) were evaluated with the snp-sites tool ​[40]​, using as
input the alignments containing the genomes generated in this study and the ​NC_045512.2 genome as
reference. The positions with SNPs were retrieved with BCFtools ​[41]​. The SNPs positions were
crossed with the depth of genome assembly and nucleotide diversity per position accessed with
bam-readcount tool (​https://github.com/genome/bam-readcount​), the outputs from bcftools and
bam-readcount were crossed with snp_div.py to access the metrics and nucleotide diversity of SNPs
by genomic region (Supplementary Material 4 and 5). Owing to the importance of Spike protein in
SARS-CoV-2 biology, Single Amino acid Polymorphisms (SAPs) and regions were deletions were
found in other SARS-CoV-2 genomes ​[42] were carefully analyzed using Aliview and karyoploteR
(​http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/karyoploteR.html​).

SARS-CoV-2 confirmed and deaths cases from Brazil and Pernambuco state were obtained
from the coronavirus website from the brazilian Ministry of Health (​https://covid.saude.gov.br/​). We
collected the number of cases and deaths per day and per epidemiological week since the first case
reported in the state (March 12th, 2020). Plots were performed using the ggplot2 package of the R
statistical language (​https://www.r-project.org/​).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Epidemiological data from Pernambuco state
The thirty-eight samples processed for whole genome amplification and sequencing were
obtained from eight municipalities of the Pernambuco state (Figure 1A). The first confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection in Pernambuco was reported in the second week of March (12th March 2020),
in the 11th epidemiological week (Figure 1B), only sixteen days after the first confirmed case in
Brazil (25th February 2020) (Figure 1B - top-left panel). In the 21st epidemiological week, the
Pernambuco state reached the peak of the pandemics reporting 8298 new cases, averaging 1185 new
cases per day (Figure 1 - top-right panel). An increasing number of deaths followed, in which the
largest number occurred at the twenty-first epidemiological with 683 deaths and an average of 97.57
deaths per day (Figure 1 - lower panel). The thirty-eight samples selected for SARS-CoV-2 whole
genome sequencing were collected at the 15th (32 samples) and 16th (six samples) epidemiological
weeks (first and second weeks of April - blue bars in Figure 1B - lower panel) representing the
beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 spread at the Pernambuco state.

week of March 2020 and the first official case reported in Pernambuco on March 12th 2020.
Genome sequencing and variability
Thirty-eight SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained with a coverage breadth ranging from
93.92 to 99.92. All genomes were considered of high quality following the GISAID criteria (showing
coverage higher than 95%) except for sample IAM138 (Table 1). We also obtained a very high
average coverage depth of 2354x with a standard deviation of 868x (Table 1).

Coverage depth was mostly uniform with few amplicons showing a much higher depth and
few systematic gaps between the 7th and 8th kb position from the ORF1ab, the ORF that generate all
non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and between 20-21kb of the Spike protein ORF (S), the
outermost protein in the coronavirus crown responsible for the cell surface receptor binding ​[43]
(Figure 2 and ​Supplementary Material ​2. These systematic gaps are probably related to primer
competition during the PCR reaction, which probably lead to a higher abundance of some amplicons
in detriment of others. It can be clearly seen in the coverage depth plot for each genome in
Supplementary Material ​2. On the other hand, at least for the Spike protein deletions, Liu et al 2020
[27] found recurrent deletions in the coding region that ​may restrict late phase viral replication both in
clinical and in vitro isolated viral strains ​[42]​. In order to investigate if these natural occurring
deletions could be responsible for such gap patterns seen in the spike protein of the genomes
sequenced here we manually checked the alignment of all genomes from Pernambuco and probed our
raw sequencing paired-end data. We could not detect any evidence of deletion in the Spike protein
region ​(NSPRRAR) or (QTQTN) (​Supplementary Material ​3) identified by Liu et al. 2020 suggesting
that the gap regions found in the genomes sequenced here were likely a result of primer competition
and the low amount of sequenced amplicons corresponding to those regions.

genomes obtained in this study. Thirty-eighth SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced using whole
genome amplification and a paired-end sequencing strategy (2 x75 bp). Red rectangles above the
Wuhan-1 reference genome are the overlapping amplicons obtained with the NetworkArtic V3 primer
sets (​https://artic.network/resources/ncov/ncov-amplicon-v3.pdf​) while red spaces in the sequenced
genomes correspond to non sequenced regions.
Regarding amino acid mutations, new evidence recently emerged showing amino acid change
in the Spike protein. An amino acid change (D614G) is of particular interest since G614 lineages have
consistently replaced well established D614 strains and could confer a fitness advantage of the former
strains leading to a higher viral load in infected patients and higher mortality rate ​[44–46] although it
is not clear yet if this mutation has any impact on virus transmissibility and covid-19 progression and
outcome ​[47]​. Besides, this amino acid change is almost always accompanied by three other
mutations: a non coding nucleotide change (C-to-T) in the 5`UTR, a synonymous nucleotide mutation
(C-to-T) at position 3,037 and a non-synonymous mutation (C-to-T) at position 14,408 that generated
an amino acid change in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp P323L). All genomes
sequenced from the Pernambuco state showed the G614 amino acid change and the three
accompanying nucleotide mutations described above, except the IAM138 strain which has all four
positions identical to Wuhan-1 reference sequence (​Figure 3​, ​Supplementary Material ​4). Recent
experimental evidence, in different human cell lines, confirmed that C614G is a key amino acid
change that increases SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and when associated with I472V may increase the
resistance to neutralizing antibodies ​[44]​. Interestingly, two hundred and two SARS-CoV-2 genomes
available from Brazil have been screened for such mutations (up to 30th July 2020) and 190 of those
contain the D614G mutation (​https://cov.lanl.gov/apps/covid-19/map/​). Such data associated with the
results from our study suggests that G614 also replaced D614 strains in a similar way as it happened
in other countries or it is a result of a founder effect based on the importation of primarily G614

Phylogenetic clustering of Pernambuco SARS-CoV-2 strains
Comprehensive analysis with thousands of genomes have identified two main SARS-CoV-2
lineages called A and B, which emerged during the beginning of the pandemic in the Hubei province China ​[30]​. Besides, a subdivision of these lineages was also proposed with 5 and 9 sub lineages
belonging to A and B lineages, respectively. Both A and B major lineages spread worldwide, but
ongoing studies have been showing that the B lineage spread and replaced the lineage A in several
different countries ​[45]​. One clear example of that was the B1 lineage, that was responsible for the
Italian outbreak ​[48,49]​, and it later spread to other European countries and several countries in the
Americas including Brazil ​[20]​. Up to now, three studies investigated the SARS-CoV-2 lineages
imported to Brazil and its further spread into the country. The largest study sequenced 427 genomes
and analyzed 490 genomes from 21 brazilian states detecting that only 5 strains belong to the lineage
A while the remaining 485 belong to the B lineage ​[20]​. These authors estimated that more than 100
international introductions of the virus occurred in Brazil. Resende et al 2020 sequenced 95 genomes
from 10 Brazilian states characterizing six SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A.2, B.1, B.1.1, B.2.1, B.2.2 and
B.6). In agreement with the above, the majority of the strains were classified as clade B.1 (95%) and
92% of those belong to the sub-clade B.1.1 ​[19]​. Lastly, Xavier et al 2020 sequenced the genome of
40 strains of SARS-CoV-2 from Minas Gerais state where 85% of these belong to the B lineage in
which most of those fall within B1.1 and only one genome belong to the A lineage ​[18]
In order to evaluate which lineages belong the genomes sequenced in this study, we
performed the lineages and sublineages assignment with Pangolin following Rambout et al 2020
dynamic nomenclature for SARS-CoV-2 and plotted it onto a ML phylogenetic tree reconstructed
with 5297 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (​Figure ​4). All thirty-eight viral genomes obtained from
Pernambuco belong to the B lineage, one strain (IAM138) was basal to all B lineages but with low
branch support (Figure 4A). This same genome presented the lowest genome coverage breadth (89%)
(Table 1) and such clustering could be related to the lower amount of sequenced synapomorphic
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). However, we found several nucleotide and amino acid
polymorphisms that are characteristic of early diverging SARS-CoV-2 lineages such as the reference
Wuhan-1 genome sequencing (see ​Genome sequencing and variability ​section above and ​Figure 3​)
suggesting that this lineage is likely a representative of the early divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages
emerged from China.
A second strain (IAM19) was assigned to the B.1 lineage and grouped with high branch
support with two SARS-CoV-2 genomes from France (​Figure ​4 B​). The remaining thirty-six strains
grouped in the B1.1 lineage (Table 1 and ​Figure ​4 C), but 10 were placed directly at a polytomic
branch showing no specific clustering with other samples. The proofreading correction of the RNA
polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 genome results in a low mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 compared to
other RNA viruses ​[50] and such low variability of densely sequenced genomes from a short period of
time likely hindered the positioning of those samples since there is a low number of informative SNPs
available for a confident phylogenetic clustering from the early pandemic phase. In addition, IAM311
sample clustered with a genome from Belgium with posterior probability of 0.83 (​Figure 4C​). On the
other hand, at least twenty-three strains grouped between them in clades containing only Pernambuco
samples with a high posterior probability branch support (over 70). It clearly reveals virus
transmission chains between neighborhoods and municipalities of the Pernambuco state corroborating
the rapid community transmission within the state (​Figure 4 C​). In addition, two samples (IAM67 and
IAM356) grouped with high branch support with a sample from Alagoas, a southern neighbouring

state (​Figure 4 C​) and IAM307 grouped with several genomes from South America having as a sister
group of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from European countries, both highly-supported (​Figure 4 C​).
Time-resolved bayesian tree reconstructions confirmed all clades (Figure 4) and the
polytomic positioning of several of the genomes investigated here as shown in the ML tree including
the basal positioning of IAM138 samples although with no branch support (Figure 5). Besides, the
estimated most recent common ancestors (tMRCA) of specific clades are in agreement to the
emergence of the virus around December 2019. The IAM19 genome clustered with two samples from
France with an estimated the more recent common ancestor (tMRCA) between late February and mid
March ​(Table 2) ​suggesting that such viral strain correspond to one of the first importation cases to
the state in agreement with the first official case reported (March 12). Moreover, all other sequenced
strains belonging to the B1.1 lineage that were clustered in highly supported clades showed
overlapping tMRCA between mid March and Mid April (Table 2) supporting that these lineages that
emerged slightly later were the most successful ones spreading in the state. ​(Figure 5)​.
Overall, our results showed two new international introduction events of the SARS-CoV-2
from Europe, spread of the virus between brazilian states and the community transmission in the
Pernambuco state. Besides, the lineage assignment further supports that the B lineage is prevailing
through community spread in Brazil in line with other SARS-CoV-2 studies.

CONCLUSION
The genomic analysis of 38 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the beginning of the epidemic at
Pernambuco state - Brazil revealed at least two independent international importation events of
SARS-CoV-2 strains from Europe occurring from late February to mid March and a more recent one
from late March to mid April which is in line with studies focusing on other Brazilian states.
Moreover, we also found evidence of comunitary spread of SARS-CoV-2 among Recife city
neighborhoods and other municipalities. Interestingly, all genomes belong to the B lineage, with a
higher prevalence of B1.1 lineage, which was shown to be the most prevalent currently circulating in
Brazil. All except one genome have the G614 amino acid change which has been suggested to
increase the viral fitness allowing to reach a higher viral load in an experimental setting and likely in
human patients. G614 strains have replaced D614 strains in several regions around the globe where
the second was first established. The high prevalence of G614 strains in our dataset suggests two
possible explanations: I - most strains that entered Brazil belonged to G614 strains or D614 and G614
were equally imported into Brazil but G614 became prevalent as it occured in European and North
American countries. Continued genomic-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a much broader set of
samples is needed in order to access the viral mutational spectra and provide data to tease apart those
hypotheses that will likely impact the control measures set to curb the epidemic.
