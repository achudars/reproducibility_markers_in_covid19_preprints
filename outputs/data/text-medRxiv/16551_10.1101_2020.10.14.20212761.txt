Abstract:
Objectives:
The 2019 pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has prompted several efforts to
find safe and effective drugs, but little is understood as to where early efforts were
centered. Several clinical trials, both Allopathy and AYUSH medicines have been registered
in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI). We aimed to characterize and extract relevant
data registered under CTRI for COVID -19.

Materials and Methods:
A cross-sectional analysis was performed of clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19
that were registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) from 1st March 2020 to
22nd June 2020. Relevant trial records were downloaded, deduplicated, and independently
analyzed by three reviewers.

Main outcomes:
Trial intervention, design, sponsorship, phase of the trial, and indicated outcomes.

Results:
233 COVID-19 clinical trials, was registered from India in CTRI. Out of these, 146 were
Interventional trials, 84 Observational trials, and three Post-marketing surveillance.
Questionnaire and survey-based intervention occupy a significant portion. Randomized
control trials are large in number 37.8% than non-randomized. 20% of the trials were
recruiting patients, and the Research institution (34%) sponsored more than half of the
trials. Global trials are minimal, occupying 3% of total trials and Indian trials were 97%. In
most of the trials, the interventional agent is either multiple drug combinations or
compound drug formulations compared to single drug administration. Among the trials, 46
Allopathic interventions, 41 Ayurveda interventions, 14 Homeopathy interventions, one in
Unani, and 2 in yoga and Naturopathy.

Introduction:
Since Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] emerged from Wuhan, China, in
December 2019, has become pandemic and rapidly crossed all countries by reporting cases
by April 2020[2]. There are 4 10 461 cases and 13 254 deaths in India as of 30th June 2020.
These data correspond to the imminent risk facing the country. Transmission of the virus
spreads via droplets, physical contact with infected individuals, contaminated surfaces [3].
Fever, Cough, Headache, and Throat pain are the most common symptoms [4]. The severe
infection leads to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sometimes
multi-organ failures such as kidney failure and even death [5]. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are
the family of Coronaviridae with four gene era (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta), and only the
alpha and beta- strains identified to be pathogenic to human [6, 7]. There are no specific
anti-viral drugs to treat COVID-19. As of now, symptomatic supportive therapy will be the
treatment protocol. Govt of India has released guidelines via the Ministry of Health and via
the AYUSH Ministry for mitigation of COVID-19. However, medical researchers on both the
ends are rigorously working for solutions to combat COVID-19. Ethical issues involved in

these attempts should guide by existing Meuri guidelines that evolved during the Ebola
outbreak.
In this context, it becomes mandatory to analyze the conduct, creditability, ethical
issues, willingness, consensual integration; intervention used out of pocket expenses,
availability of the drugs, and drugs that emerged out of Indian origin. Above all, the
characters were extracted from the trials registered in Clinical Trials Registry—India
(CTRI).
The Clinical Trials Registry—India (CTRI) is a free and online public record domain
for registration of clinical trials conducted in India from 20th July 2007. Drug Controller
General of India has made it mandatory to register clinical trials at CTRI since 15th June
2009. Registering clinical trials is a contemporary issue in present health researchers [8].
The analysis performed using the data available online with CTRI helped us look for the
characters mentioned above in the purview of COVID-19, which may help more in future
pandemics. In the present study, the content from clinical trials registered in India was
summarized and analyzed from various perspectives and design of clinical trials for COVID19.

Materials and Methods
Search Strategy
'COVID-19' and 'INDIA' 'Coronavirus' or 'COVID-19' or 'COVID19' or '2019 novel
coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV' or 'SARS-CoV-2' (were used as the keywords to search for all
COVID-19 clinical trials registered from India on CTRI (Clinical Trials Registry – India) [9]
from 1st March 2020 to 22nd June 2020. All retrieved records were downloaded. The
following data were collected: study title, study type, study design, primary outcome
measures, condition, Number of groups, Intervention, blinding, phase of trials, and sample
size. A standard Microsoft-Excel database was created for the analysis.

Trial selection
We included all studies conducted on patients diagnosed with COVID-19. First, we
selected clinical trials based on the 'study type' variable. The variable contains
interventional and observational studies and others. We included all AYUSH system trials,
and our study does not have any limits based on the outcome.

Statistical Analyses
All continuous values were expressed as a median and interquartile range, and
categorical variables are expressed as percentages. All statistical procedures were
performed using the SPSS software (Version 26).

Data extraction and management
We extracted the following information from each trial: CTRI trial number,
registration date, recruitment status (recruiting, not yet recruiting, withdrawn or
canceled), recruitment country, phase (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1–2, 2–3, not applicable and missing),
sponsor, health condition, an intervention model (single-arm, parallel, cross-over, factorial,
platform trial or sequential), type of study, study design, sample size, trial duration,
allocation, blinding (open, single, double, triple or quadruple), primary outcomes.

Results
The Number of COVID-19 Clinical Trials Registered in India, 233 COVID-19 clinical
trials, was registered from India in CTRI. After the general analysis, 146 Interventional
trials, 84 Observational trials, and 3 Post-marketing surveillance were registered. The rates
of trial registration are incoherence, the incidence, and the intensity of the disease. There is
an ascending pattern in registration from March reaching its peak in May and slowing
down in June. India had registered 107 more trials than China in a set period of three
months (n- India (233) - n-China (126) = n=107) (Table – 1)(Figure – 1,2)
The recruitment status has been calculated here at least fifteen days after the trial is
registered in CTRI. At this point, not less than 50 % of the trials have not started recruiting.
COVID-19 is a peculiar condition wherein prophylaxis plays an important role, which is
evident from 32% of the people either in the survey or as a prophylactic intervention have
been registered under the category as healthy volunteers. However, it is also noteworthy
that 62% of the trials are COVID-19 affected individuals, which may benefit human society
by and large (Figure -3)
The intervention of various Medical systems are described in descending order;
surveys are dealt with separately. Allopathy and Ayurveda have a significant share of (25%
each) followed by Homeopathy 5.6%, Siddha 4.3%, Unani 0.5%, Yoga 1.3% (Table – 1)
(Figure -4). Questionnaire and survey-based intervention occupy a significant portion.
There is a demand for analyzing the nature of people's disease, psychological, social, and

lifestyle adaptation toward the new regular life pattern in lockdown. In certain hospitals,
integrated treatment is available for Ayurveda and Homeopathy, Ayurveda, and Yoga &
Naturopathy. There are database observations reported in certain hospitals that portrayed
integrated treatment between Allopathy and Siddha in Tamil Nadu. Clinical trials with
integrated approaches of Allopathy and Siddha are happening at Noida. New Delhi.
As of the current date, more than 46 Allopathic interventions from Anti-viral, Antimalarial,
oncologic drugs, Immunotherapies, Vaccines, and Plasma therapy are in testing. At the
same time, Siddha has 10 Medicines in the clinical trial platform. Ayurveda has used 41
medicines, 14 are used in Homeopathy Medicine, and Unani had one, and 2 in Yoga and
Naturopathy were tried (Table -2).

Study design
Randomized control trials are large in number 37.8% than non-randomized, 11.2%,
and Single-arm trials are next to RCT sharing 20.2%. Cohort studies are lesser 0.5% alone.
Among the global trials except one study checking the efficacy of remdesiver and all other
studies are observations and surveys. However, in the domestic trial scenario is a little
different. Nearly 20% of the trials were recruiting patients, and more than half of the trials
were sponsored by Research institution (34%) followed by others (29%), colleges (10%),
Pharmaceutical industry – Indian (10%), and private colleges/ clinic (10%) (Table – 1)
(Figure -5). The Number of COVID-19 clinical trials registered in CTRI is considerably high
over the past three months.

Sponsors
As in other scenarios, Research Institution occupies Trials' significant share (33%),
followed by Pharmaceutical Industries and Medical colleges. Private hospitals and medical
colleges register 25 %of trials (Table – 1).

Percentage of Global trials
Intercontinental of the inter-country collaborated global trial is minimal in Number,
indicating the complexity of the disease. Global trials are minimal, occupying 3% of total
trials and Indian trials were 97% (Table – 1) (Figure -6).

Sample size

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.14.20212761; this version posted October 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

The sample size varies between n=1 to n=5000 and above. 43% of trials have a sample size
within 100 and followed by 32% of cases with a sample size within 500. This is followed by
11% of trials having a Sample size between 1 and 5000. 7% of trials have a large sample
size above 5000, and 6% recruit within 1000 (Table – 1) (Figure -7).

Randomization
Certain trials have adopted Adaptive Randomization, which is 3%, which has a
chance of allocating patients following the already existing treatment groups. Stratified and
Block Randomization occupies equal share (4% each). Stratified randomization helps in
small trials, Permuted block randomization balances between the two intervention groups.
However, many of the COVID 19 trials have been used—computer-generated
randomization to prevent bias and human error. Computer Randomization occupies a
significant share of 22% (Table – 1).

Blinding
While 86% of Trials are not blinded, Double-blind trials are 5.5%, followed by Single
blinded 5.15%. 1.72% of trials are triple blinded, and two trials are quadruple blinded
(Table – 1).

Trial Phases Involved
From the applicable 48%, below 4% evaluate the Safety of Drugs, Therapeutic
exploratory is 24%, and Therapeutic confirmatory occupies 16%. Some trials have been
listed as Phase IV supporting repurposing phenomena like Lozenges.

Trial Duration
Five % of trials only showed trial duration greater than one year. 35% of both
category with 1-3 month and 3 to 6 months falls in this duration (Figure -8).

Discussion:
This study aims to measure the preparedness of various Indian health stakeholders
controlled by two Ministries, one dealing with the conventional therapy (Ministry of Health
and Family welfare) and the other with Indian traditional medicine (Ministry of AYUSH).

Clinical trial registries are depots of newer ideas and newer interventions. The kinesis of
conducting a Clinical trial during a pandemic is different from the normal situation.
Understanding this scenario, Govt. of India has directed every clinical trial registered in
CTRI. Ministry of AYUSH has released a particular GO, regulating the clinical trial during
COVID -19. A bird-eye view and the Interventions used to support an ideology of
repurposing existing drugs for novel coronavirus. PM of India has emphasized using
immunomodulators from the AYUSH sector in his famous Mann Ke Baat talk. This study
revealed that large-scale prophylactic prevention trials have been registered and used as a
weapon to contain the disease to its might. Encouragingly, many medical colleges have
collaborated with the AYUSH sector to integrate with the public's interventions or compare
the ordinary person's benefits. It is evident that both healthy volunteers (32%) and
affected individuals (68%) have also been subjected to trial in this pandemic situation, and
many have consented to participate. It shows the tendency of humankind to find a solution
to hunting problems and returning to normalcy.
Allopathic versus AYUSH interventions are equal in which Allopathy and Ayurveda
occupy 49%, followed by Homeopathy, Siddha, Unani, and Yoga and Naturopathy in
descending order.
As this a newer pandemic, after 100 years, a country like India and there exists a
particular need for a keen understanding of the disease condition and its epidemiological
aspects. This is reflected in the CTRI having a sizeable number of survey questionaries.
Almost all the systems Ayurveda and Siddha, in particular, have integrated with Allopathy.
Siddha, as integrated with Yoga and Ayurveda, has integrated with Homeopathy in certain
hospitals.
At this pandemic, health stakeholders have taken a significant step to stick with
standards reflected in 38% of the RCTs in CTRI. Next occupies open-ended single-arm trial
followed by Non-randomized trial. It is tougher to follow a group in a pandemic, evident
from only 0.5 % of cohort studies.
Research institutions and Medical colleges occupy a significant part of the trial, but
only 10% of the pharmaceutical industry is taking up this issue. There exist much scope for

pharmaceutical industries to invest more in real research. Global integrated trials are very
minimal, which once again is an alarming sign in research.
Therapeutic exploratory and therapeutic confirmatory occupies a significant share
while a sizeable number of trials have searched for Safety; based on the repurposing idea,
some trials are designed as Phase IV, which are like measuring the benefit of lozenges
among COVID -19 patients. The disease's complexity has affected blinding in the trials,
where only 14% of the trials are blinded. Among them, double-blinding occupies many, and
some are triple and quadruple blinding.
At a given point in time, India has 107 trials than China, which expresses the country
preparedness following the incidence and intensity of the disease.

Conclusion:
Despite the lockdown, the front line workers and health stakeholders of this country
are serious about their business finding a solution for the problem stated, i.e., COVID -19.
Allopathy and AYUSH's health sectors have attempted in rapidity, which shows their surge
to act against COVID -19. Revalidated interventions that have been used earlier in Dengue,
Malaria, Immunomodulators and Earlier anti-virals and drugs used in Cancer and HIV are
among the selected interventions. The outcome objectives were symptom reduction,
getting negative in RT-PCR, reduction in hospitalization, minimal use of ICU, ventilators,
and reduced mortality were the objectives observed. Post COVID-19 management clinical
trials were not registered during the said time. However, there exists a lot of scope and
necessity to do trials in Post Covid prospectively.

Limitations:
In this, the analysis was limited to a cross-sectional study of trials registered in the
COVID -19 pandemic concerning AYUSH and Allopathy stream on CTRI. Like study type,
study design, sponsorship, and relevant details on trial characteristics presented and
analyzed from 1st March 2020 to 22nd June 2020. We did not include trials from the WHO
database, US Canada, China, and other Clinical Trials Database. This analysis will give useful
data based on CTRI by gathering information to improve quality research opportunities. In
