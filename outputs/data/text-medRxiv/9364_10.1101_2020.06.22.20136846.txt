Abstract
Objectives
To compare the performance of chest computed tomography (CT) scan versus reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the reference standard in the initial diagnostic assessment of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Design
A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search of electronic information was
conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL and the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL).

Setting
Studies that compared the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan
versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected patients.

Participants
Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified.

Main Outcome Measures
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included
other test performance characteristics and discrepant findings between both investigations.

Results
Chest CT had a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 0.91 (0.82-0.98), 0.775 (0.25-1.00) and 0.87
(0.68-0.99), respectively, with RT-PCR as the reference. Importantly, early small, China-based studies
tended to favour chest CT versus later larger, non-China studies.

Conclusions
A relatively high false positive rate can be expected with chest CT. It may still be useful, however, in
patients with a suspicious clinical presentation of COVID-19 and a negative initial SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR. In acute cardiorespiratory presentations, negative CT scan and RT-PCR tests is likely to be
reassuring.

Highlights
-

The median accuracy of chest computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) is relatively high at 0.87 (range 0.68-0.99)

-

Chest CT has relatively low specificity, even within the context of a pandemic, for the
diagnosis of COVID-19 with an associated relatively high false positive rate

-

Chest CT scan, however, appears to be able to detect most initially positive and most initially
negative/subsequently positive RT-PCR diagnosed cases

1. Background
In December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) emerged from Wuhan city, China [1-2]. SARSCOV-2 is part of the Coronavirdae family that includes the common cold, Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). These viruses can cause Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), bilateral pneumonia and pulmonary failure leading to
mortality [3]. There is yet to be a highly effective pharmacological therapy identified for COVID-19,
further highlighting the importance of early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients to prevent
the spread of the disease [4].
Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are currently the gold
standard diagnostic tool for COVID-19. RT-PCR assays can be performed on nasopharyngeal and/or
oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, blood samples, body fluids, stool samples and bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid [5]. RT-PCR is limited by its low sensitivity and associated relatively high number of falsenegative results that can lead to the erroneous assumption that a patient who does actually have
COVID-19 does not have it and is not infectious, leading to an undetected transmission risk in either
the community or within an institutional setting [4].
CT has become a standard of care in the diagnosis and assessment of a variety of respiratory
conditions and optimises the management process [6-7]. Although CT scans are not routinely used
to diagnose ARDS, certain complications relating to mechanical ventilation, including pneumonia,
pneumothorax and emphysema, are sometimes identified by CT but not chest radiography [8]. In
addition, CT imaging can be used to identify lung atelectasis due to poor positioning of the
endotracheal tube as well as potentially directing ventilation to achieve optimal pressures and air
recruitment [8]. This is important in relation to COVID-19 since patients in ICU require optimisation
of ventilatory settings and it is increasingly recognised that prone ventilation appears favourable [9].
Nevertheless, in the clinical setting, the benefits of routine CT imaging must be weighed against the
considerable practicalities and risks, including that of infection transmission associated with

transporting a patient from the intensive care unit, or elsewhere in the hospital, to the radiology
department [8]. The Royal College of Radiologists does not recommend the use of CT-scanning as a
diagnostic tool for COVID-19, as a negative CT result does not rule out COVID-19 infection, except for
when CT-scanning results can change the management course, such as in those who require
emergency surgery [10]. Furthermore, both the American Society of Emergency Radiology and the
Society of Thoracic Radiology advise against the use of CT-scanning as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19
[11].
Given the recent observational studies of chest CT and RT-RCR in detecting COVID-19 cases
[4,12-23], there is a need for ongoing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies that have
directly compared the performance of these tests in the same patient cohorts. This study aimed to
compare the performance of chest CT-scan versus RT-PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 by
systematic review and meta-analysis of truly comparative studies.

2. Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted as per the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [24].

2.1.

Eligibility criteria
All relevant studies comparing chest CT with RT-PCR (as the reference standard) in the

diagnosis of patients with suspected COVID-19 were included [4,12-23]. Chest CT was the
intervention group of interest and RT-PCR was the comparator. All patients were included
irrespective of age, gender or co-morbidity status. Studies that did not compare the two tests
directly within the same patient cohort were excluded. Studies enrolling only confirmed COVID-19
cases or studies performing chest CT for prognostic purposes were also excluded.

2.2.

Primary Outcomes
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases were the primary

outcomes. Sensitivity (true positive rate) is the proportion of actual COVID-19 cases a test correctly

identifies. Specificity (true negative rate) is the proportion of non-COVID-19 cases a test correctly
identifies. Accuracy is the proportion (true positives and true negatives) of total cases examined a
test correctly identifies.

2.3.

Secondary Outcomes
The secondary outcomes were positive predictive value (in the event of a positive test the

probability the patient is truly positive), negative predictive value (in the event of a negative test the
probability the patient is truly negative), positive (PLR) and negative likelihood (NLR) ratios
(respectively, the probability a person who has COVID-19 testing positive divided by the probability
of a person who does not have COVID-19 testing positive [PLR] and the probability of a person who
has COVID-19 testing negative divided by the probability of a person who does not have COVID-19
testing negative [NLR]), and discrepancy of findings between both investigations.

2.4.

Search Strategy
Three authors independently searched online databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE,

EMCARE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The last search
was run on 23rd of August 2020. Thesaurus headings, search operators and limits in each of the
above databases were adapted accordingly. In addition, the WHO International Clinical Trials
Registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN Register and medRxiv were also searched for ongoing and
unpublished studies. The search terminologies included “COVID-19”, “Coronavirus”, “SARS-CoV-2”,
“CT”, “computed tomography”, “PCR” and “polymerase chain reaction”. The bibliographic lists of
relevant articles were also reviewed.

2.5.

Selection of Studies
The title and abstract of articles identified from the literature searches were assessed. The

full texts of relevant reports were retrieved and those articles that met the eligibility criteria of our
review were selected.

2.6.

Data Extraction
An electronic data extraction spreadsheet was created in line with Cochrane’s data

collection form for intervention reviews. Three authors cooperatively collected and recorded the
results with any disagreements resolved via discussion.

2.7.

Data Synthesis
Data synthesis was conducted using the Review Manager 5.3 software and Microsoft Excel.

The results are reported in forest plots with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and tables. A summary
receiver operator characteristic (sROC) curve was also generated.

2.8.

Subgroup Analyses
Additional sub-group comparisons were performed to assess differences in results for China-

based versus non-China and large versus small studies.

2.9.

Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment
Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias of

included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [25]. It offers a maximum score of nine stars
across three domains: selection, comparability and exposure. The overall rating of good, fair or poor
quality was based on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) standards [25].

3. Results
3.1.

Literature Search Results
Our search strategy retrieved 1,630 studies. Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria for

inclusion following systematic review of abstracts and manuscripts as appropriate (Figure 1).

3.2.

Characteristics of Included Studies
The baseline characteristics of the included studies are summarised in Table 1. All included

studies were comparative with CT scans being assessed using RT-PCR as the reference (‘gold’)
standard.

Primary Outcomes:

3.3.1.

Discriminatory power (sensitivity and specificity)
Sensitivity to detect COVID-19 cases was reported in 13 studies enrolling 4092 patients

(Figure 2). The median sensitivity of CT for the identification of COVID-19 cases was 0.91 (range 0.820.98) as demonstrated in Table 2. The specificity of CT scanning in identifying COVID-19 was
reported in 10 studies enrolling 3689 patients (Figure 2). The median specificity for chest CT was
0.775 (range 0.25-1.00) as shown in Table 2. The discriminatory power of CT scanning in identifying
patients with COVID-19 from non-infected patients, based on area under the sROC, is shown in
Figure 3.
3.3.2.

Diagnostic effectiveness (accuracy)
Accuracy to detect and exclude COVID-19 cases by CT scan was reported in 13 studies

enrolling 4092 patients with a median accuracy of 0.87 (range 0.68-0.99) as demonstrated in Table 2.

3.4.

Secondary Outcomes:

3.4.1.

Other test performance characteristics
As shown in Table 2, CT scanning had median positive and negative predictive values of 0.89

(range 0.59-1.00) and 0.85 (range 0.73-0.98), respectively. Additionally, the median PLR and NLR for
CT scan were 3.185 (range 1.29-18.35) and 0.13 (range 0.03-0.25) in turn.
3.4.2.

Discrepancy of Findings
Ai et al. [4] (n = 1014) reported that 75% (n = 310) of patients with negative RT-PCR results

and 97% (n = 583) of those with positive results had positive chest CT findings. Across all studies,
9.1% (230/2529) of PCR positive patients had a negative CT scan and 79.2% (42/53) of patients who
initially had a negative PCR but then had a positive PCR later had a CT scan suggestive of COVID-19
(Supplemental Material 1).

3.5.

Subgroup Analyses

3.5.1.

China and Non-China Based Studies
China-based studies had an accuracy range of 0.68 to 0.99 (median 0.92; 50% of studies had

an accuracy of >0.95) versus 0.72 to 0.89 (median 0.86; no studies had an accuracy of >0.9) in nonChina studies in the identification of COVID-19 (Supplemental Material 2).
3.5.2.

Larger and Smaller Studies
There was also a difference between larger (n ≥100) and smaller (n <100) study subgroups in

accuracy for the identification COVID-19 (Supplemental Material 3). Larger studies had an accuracy
range of 0.68 to 0.96 (median 0.825; 30% of studies had an accuracy ≥0.88) versus 0.88 to 0.99
(median 0.98; all studies had an accuracy of ≥0.88) for smaller studies.

3.6.

Methodological Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment
Although comparability was low in all the studies included, selection and exposure were of

higher quality (Supplemental Material 4). Overall, all studies were of good quality based on the
AHRQ standards [25].

4. Discussion:
Our findings suggest that CT scanning performs relatively well compared to RT-PCR as the
reference standard in the initial detection of COVID-19 in the clinical context of the studies
presented. Relatively few false negatives (approximately 9%) can be expected with CT scanning in
the context of a pandemic, although the expected false positive rate is higher at approximately
22.5%. The performance characteristics of all tests is context dependent, however, which means
that the performance of CT for identifying COVID-19 will be different outside of a pandemic and in
areas of the world with different endemicities. When the causes of bilateral CT changes return to the
usual heterogeneous state, with SARS-CoV-2 only one of many potential causes, as was the situation
pre-pandemic, the performance of CT will likely deteriorate with an even higher number of false
positives, in keeping with the relatively modest PLR for CT, even within a pandemic setting [4]. For
patients requiring hospitalisation with an acute cardio-respiratory presentation who undergo CT
scanning, however, a negative CT scan is reassuring, particularly if RT-PCR is also negative in keeping
with the low NLR for CT. Our results cannot be extrapolated to healthier SARS-CoV-2 patient cohorts
who are managed on an outpatient basis or in a community setting.
Diagnostic tests always have inherent strengths and weaknesses. In the case of the COVID19 pandemic it would be preferable to have a simple, rapid test with high sensitivity leading to a low
number of false negatives thereby allowing accurate decision-making regarding, for example, who
may be infectious and requires isolation in the hospital setting or home isolation in the community.
Based on those who had a suggestive CT but tested negative with RT-PCR, our findings suggest that
CT scan may be able to detect a high proportion of hospitalised COVID-19 cases overall and may be
useful when PCR testing is initially negative but clinical suspicion high [4]. There were relatively few
patients who had a negative CT scan, but who were initially RT-PCR positive. Of the studies that
reported patients who were initially RT-PCR negative, but subsequently became positive, 79.2% of
patients (42/53) had a suggestive CT. It is important to note that across the studies, however, only a
small proportion who were initially RT-PCR negative were systematically retested.

Overall, our results suggest that chest CT scan may be a useful adjunct to RT-PCR in the
initial detection of COVID-19 in certain circumstances, but not routinely, which supports published
guidance and thus we do not advocate a change in practice. CT scans are subject to their inherent
limitations. Firstly, they are best avoided during pregnancy due to the excessive radiation and risk of
harming the foetus [26]. In addition, over-scanning patients with suspected COVID-19 can increase
the risk of incidental imaging findings and an unnecessary financial burden on the healthcare system
[27]. Furthermore, the use of CT-scans for suspected cases is not practical since SARS-CoV-2 has a
relatively high transmission rate; each CT machine needs to be sterilised after use, which can waste
time and resources as well as overworking the radiology department in times of need resulting in
delayed reporting of other potentially life-threatening conditions.
Given the above, and based on our results therefore, we suggest that chest CT is limited to a
supplementary diagnostic role for COVID-19 in patients with suspicious symptoms, but who have
had at least one negative RT-PCR test result. In such situations, a repeat upper respiratory tract RTPCR, which is simple to do, rather than a CT scan should be performed first, although in our clinical
experience some patients with suspicious presentations are repeatedly negative or only positive on
a third or fourth test. Lower respiratory tract specimens (i.e. sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) are
more likely to be positive in this patient cohort, although most hospitalised patients are neither
productive nor ventilated.
This review provides a summary of the best available evidence using a systematic approach
and evaluated the risk of bias of included studies [4,12-23]. Although Kim et al. recently published a
meta-analysis on this topic, many of the studies included were not comparative (i.e. the tests were
not compared within the same patient cohorts) [28]. Our study synthesised comparative studies
only, and also included additional recently published studies and those in preprint, so our results
may more accurately represent how the investigations can be expected to perform and compare to
RT-PCR in routine clinical practice and as the pandemic progresses. Additionally, we also performed
important sub-group analyses that demonstrate how these tests may compare in different contexts,

including the fallacy of basing conclusions about a test’s performance early in a pandemic on small
studies in one geographic location.
The reported results should be considered in the context of inherent limitations. Only 13
non-randomised studies were identified enrolling a total of 4092 participants, which may not
be enough to draw definite conclusions and suggesting the need for further robust prospective
diagnostic research in COVID-19. The performance of molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to
improve and be closer at the point-of-care with time. Likewise, the use of, for example, machine
learning algorithms to interpret chest CT scan appearances may more accurately confirm COVID-19
than human reporting in the future, and thereby decrease the false-positive rate of CT scanning that
can be expected to increase as the pandemic wanes. Some included studies had incomplete data
resulting in difficulty in comparing both interventions completely. Additionally, all but one study
included a relatively small number of patients and the majority were of retrospective observational
design, with all the associated caveats. It is likely that further large comparative, and possibly
prospective, studies will be reported with further meta-analyses required. The between-study
heterogeneity for outcomes was high for sensitivity and accuracy.

5. Conclusions
Our study synthesised the best available comparative evidence, using a systematic approach,
for the identification of COVID-19 using chest CT versus RT-PCR as the reference standard [4,12-23].
Our results suggest that chest CT scan may be a useful adjunct in the initial detection of COVID-19 in
certain hospitalised patients in the context of a pandemic. We suggest RT-PCR remains the primary
diagnostic tool and that chest CT is only considered if there is a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19
with repeatedly negative RT-PCR test results, providing infection prevention and control measures
can be maintained. A negative CT scan is likely to be reassuring in a RT-PCR negative patient
requiring hospitalisation for possible COVID-19.
