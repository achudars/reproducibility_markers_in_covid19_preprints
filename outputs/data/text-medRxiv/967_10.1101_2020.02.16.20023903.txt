Abstract

54

Background Since late December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by the

55

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and

56

continued to spread throughout China and across the globe. To date, few data on immunologic

57

features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported.

58

Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who

59

were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were

60

included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their

61

clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10

62

moderate cases.

63

Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the

64

Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of

65

severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%)

66

moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%),

67

cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and

68

moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than

69

moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (0.7 ×

70

10 /L) than moderate cases (1.1 × 10 /L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase

71

levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases

72

(41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4

73

U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were

74

significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than

75

moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T

76

lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were

77

significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 × 106/L) than moderate cases

78

(676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 × 106/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be

79

lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%).

80

Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly

81

CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which

Introduction

89

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause diseases ranging

90

from the common cold to the Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe

91

Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)1,2, both of which are zoonotic in origin and induce fatal

92

lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary manifestations. The new

93

coronavirus, designated as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

94

(SARS-CoV-2), is a member of Beta-CoV lineage B, which was first identified in Wuhan,

95

China by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)3,4. Recent reports

96

have provided evidence for person to person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in family and

97

hospital settings

98

eclipsed 14000, exceeding the total number of SARS cases during the 2003 epidemic, and

99

more than 300 people had now died. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2-induced Coronavirus

100

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has put health authorities on high alert in China and across the

101

globe.

102

It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence 75% to 80% identical to the

103

SARS-CoV and has more similarities to several bat coronaviruses3. Both clinical and

104

epidemiological features of patients with COVID-19 have recently been reported,

105

demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness

106

with clinical presentations greatly resembling SARS-CoV, leading to ICU admission and high

107

mortality7. Clinical manifestations have included fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath,

108

and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, a study of the first 41

109

laboratory-confirmed cases with COVID-19 showed that 63% of patients had lymphopenia,

110

and cytokine storm could be associated with disease severity. However, little is known about

111

immunologic features between severe and moderate forms of COVID-197.

112

In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of characteristics of 21 patients with

113

COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. We aimed to compare the clinical and

114

immunologic features between severe cases and moderate cases. These findings will help us

115

extend our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

116

Patients and methods

117

Study participants

118

From late Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020, a total of 21 cases who initially presented with fever

119

or respiratory symptoms, with pulmonary infiltrates on chest computed tomography (CT)

120

scans in isolation ward of Department of Infectious Disease, Tongji hospital were later

121

confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus by the local health authority. Four cases

122

had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market.

123

We retrospectively evaluated and analyzed the medical history, physical examination, and

124

hematological, biochemical, radiological, microbiological and immunological evaluation

125

results obtained from these 21 patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,

126

and radiological characteristics and treatment as well as outcomes data were obtained from

127

electronic medical records. The data collection forms were reviewed independently by two

128

researchers.

129

The patients with SpO2≤93% or respiratory rates ≥30 per min were classified as having

130

severe COVID-19, those without above-mentioned signs as moderate cases.

131

Considering the emergence of COVID-19 cases during the influenza season, oseltamivir

132

(orally 75 mg twice daily) and antibiotics (oral and intravenous) were empirically

133

administered. Corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone) was given concomitantly to some

134

patients with COVID-19 by physicians. Oxygen support including nasal cannula and

135

non-invasive mechanical ventilation was provided to the patients according to the severity of

136

hypoxemia. After being identified as having laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,

137

these patients were transferred to the designated hospital.

138

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical

139

College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

140
141

Complication definitions

142

ARDS and shock were defined according to the interim guidance of WHO for novel

143

coronavirus8.

144

Hypoxemia was defined as arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction

145

(FIO2) of less than 300 mm Hg.

146

Acute kidney injury was identified and classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine

147

level or urine output criteria according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes

classification.

149

Acute liver injury was defined as jaundice with a total bilirubin level of

150

acute increase in alanine aminotransferase of at least five times the upper limit of the normal

151

range and/or an increase in alkaline phosphatase of at least twice the upper limit of the normal

152

range.

153

Cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomarkers were > the 99th percentile

154

upper reference limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography and

155

echocardiography.

156

Secondary infection including bacteria and fungus was diagnosed if the patients had clinical

157

symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumonia or bacteremia, and was combined with a

Results

218

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics of severe and moderate forms of

219

COVID-19

220

By Jan 22, 2020, a total of 21 admitted hospital patients with pneumonia were identified as

221

laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan Tongji hospital. Of these patients,

222

only four patients including a familial cluster of three confirmed cases had direct exposure to

223

Huanan seafood market. 11 (52.4%) patients with SpO2≤93% or respiratory rates ≥30 per min

224

who required high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive mechanical ventilation using the

225

Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) mode to correct hypoxemia, were classified as

226

having severe COVID-19, whereas 10 (47.6%) patients without above-mentioned signs as

227

moderate cases. 10 (90.9%) of severe cases and 7 (70%) of moderate cases were male (table

228

1). The mean age of the severe cases (63.9 years) was significantly older than moderate cases

229

(51.4 years). 90.9% of severe cases were above 50 years old, which was more frequent than

230

that of moderate cases (50%). 5 (45.5%) of severe cases and 2 (20%) moderate cases had

231

underlying diseases. Of 7 patients with underlying diseases, four patients had hypertension,

232

two had diabetes, and one had both hypertension and diabetes. The mean time from onset of

233

symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.3 days in severe cases and 5.5 days in moderate

234

cases.

235

Four of eleven severe cases died at an average of 20 days after the onset of the illness. Of

236

these four fatal cases, all of them were male and had age over 50 years old, and two had

237

hypertension. Mean age of fatal cases were 67.5 years old. Three of the fatal cases had

238

PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 100 on admission.

239

Excluding one comatose patient without a clear history (classified as severe case), the most

240

common clinical manifestations at onset of illness include fever (100% of total cases), cough

241

(70% of severe cases, 90% of moderate cases), fatigue (100% of severe cases, 70% of

242

moderate cases) and myalgia (50% of severe cases, 30% of moderate cases). Less common

243

symptoms include sputum production (20% of severe cases, 30% of moderate cases), diarrhea

244

(10% of severe cases, 30% of moderate cases), headache (10% of severe cases, 10% of

245

moderate cases) and hemoptysis (10% of severe cases). All the severe cases developed

246

dyspnea, and nine of them had SpO2<93% even with high-flow nasal cannula, who were then

247

ventilated using the BiPAP mode to treat hypoxemia. The mean duration from illness onset to

248

dyspnea was 8.6 days. Arterial blood gas (ABG) test was performed in 10 patients on

249

admission (six severe and four moderate cases). Of them, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly

250

lower in severe cases (122.9 mmHg) than moderate cases (366.2 mmHg). Three severe cases

251

had PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 100, indicating severe ARDS.

252
253

Laboratory findings and CT scans of severe and moderate forms of COVID-19

254

The routine blood tests on admission of three (30%) moderate cases showed mild leucopenia

255

(white blood cell count (WBC) < 4 × 10 /L). WBC counts were normal or slightly increased

256

in all the severe cases. Both WBC and neutrophil counts were significantly higher in severe

257

cases (9.2 × 10 /L and 8.0 × 10 /L) than moderate cases (4.7 × 10 /L and 3.1 × 10 /L).

258

Whereas lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (0.7 × 10 /L) than

259

moderate cases (1.1 × 10 /L). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <0.8 × 10 /L) was found in

260

8 (72.7%) severe cases and only 1 (10.0%) moderate cases (table 2).

261

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were

262

significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L and 51.0 U/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L

263

and 24.2 U/L). Albumin concentrations were significantly lower in severe cases (31.5g/L)

264

than moderate cases (37.6g/L). Levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly

265

higher in severe cases (567.2 U/L) than moderate cases (234.4 U/L).

266

Concentrations of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and ferritin on

267

admission were significantly elevated in severe cases (135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than

268

moderate cases (51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). Serum levels of procalcitonin on admission

269

tended to be higher in severe cases (0.5 ng/mL) than moderate cases (0.1 ng/mL). Activated

270

partial thromboplastin time (APTT) on admission was significantly shorter in severe cases

271

(36.2s) than moderate cases (44.6s). D-dimer levels on admission were markedly greater in

272

severe cases (8.2 ug/mL) than moderate cases (0.4 ug/mL).

273

Interstitial lung abnormalities were observed in chest CT scans of all patients on admission.

274

Of the 21 patients, 10 (90.1%) severe cases and 7 (70%) moderate cases had bilateral

remained unilateral involvement. The typical findings of chest CT images of severe

277

COVID-19 on admission showed bilateral ground glass opacity and subsegmental areas of

278

consolidation (figure 1A), then progressed rapidly with mass shadows of high density in both

279

lungs (figure 1B). Whereas the representative chest CT findings of moderate COVID-19

280

showed bilateral ground glass opacity (figure 1C). Later chest CT images revealed bilateral

281

ground-glass opacity had been resolved (figure 1D).

282
283

Immunologic features of severe and moderate forms of COVID-19

284

Evaluation of plasma cytokines revealed that IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α concentrations

285

on admission were moderately elevated in the majority of severe cases (88.9%, 88.9%, 77.8%,

286

and 88.9%), but only mildly increased (14.3%, 71.4%, 28.6%, and 42.9%) or remained within

287

the normal range in moderate cases (table 3). IL-8 concentrations were elevated in few

288

patients (22.2% severe cases, 14.3% moderate cases). IL-1β concentrations were undetectable

289

(<5pg/mL) in nearly all the patients with either severe or moderate COVID-19. IL-2R, TNF-α

290

and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4

291

pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6

292

pg/mL).

293

Preliminary analysis of circulating immune cells subsets showed that absolute number of total

294

T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in the majority of patients with either

295

severe (100%, 100% and 87.5%) or moderate COVID-19 (83.3%, 100% and 83.3%), and

296

total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells counts were reduced more profoundly in

297

severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 × 106/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 ×

298

106/L) (figure 2A, 2B). More severe cases (100%) had the proportion of HLA-DR+ expression

299

on CD8+T cells (of > 35%) than moderate cases (25%). Reduction of B cells and NK cells

300

counts tended to be more frequent in severe cases (37.5% and 75%) than moderate cases (16.7%

301

and 33.3%), whereas the proportion of B cells was significantly higher in severe cases (26.5%)

302

than moderate cases (12.0%). This could be partly due to the more significant decrease of T

303

lymphocytes in severe cases. In addition, six (75.0%) of eight severe cases showed a broad,

304

significant decrease in all the lymphocytes subsets excluding B cells, with total T

305

lymphocytes counts below 400 × 106/L, CD8+T cells counts below 150 × 106/L, and NK cells

306

counts below 77 × 106/L. Of these six patients, three (50%) eventually died.

307

Moreover, the frequencies of Treg (CD4+CD25+CD127low+) and CD45RA+Treg decreased in

308

nearly all the severe (60% and 100%) and moderate cases (100% and 100%), with

309

CD45RA+Treg decreased more profoundly in severe cases (0.5%) than moderate cases (1.1%).

310

The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T, CD8+T and NK cells were decreased in some patients

311

with severe (50%, 16.7% and 16.7%) or moderate COVID-19 (14.3%, 0% and 14.3%). The

312

expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than

313

moderate cases (23.6%) (figure 2C).

314
315

Complications and clinical outcomes of COVID-19

316

As for complications, nine (81.8%) severe cases and one (10%) moderate case developed

317

ARDS, among them, three (27.3%) severe cases had confirmed severe ARDS by ABG test

318

with PaO2/FiO2

319

including acute kidney injury, cardiac injury and heart failure as well as pulmonary

320

encephalopathy prior to admission. Another patient developed acute liver injury and

321

disseminated intravascular coagulation in a short time. These two patients died soon

322

afterwards. One patient with severe COVID-19 developed acute liver injury and was in

323

recovery and discharged after a three-week hospitalization, with extracorporeal membrane

324

oxygenation (ECMO) support. The chest CT scan afterwards showed improvement of

325

bilateral ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation.

326

Of 21 patients, nine (42.9%) required non-invasive ventilation. 19 (90.5%) patients received

327

antiviral therapy (oseltamivir and ganciclovir). All patients were given empirical

328

antimicrobial treatment (moxifloxacin or cefoperazone-sulbactam). In Addition, most patients

329

(85.7%) were administered corticosteroids (methylprednisolone). As of Feb 2, 2020, 4

330

(36.4 %) of 11 severe cases and none (0.0 %) of the moderate cases have died, the average

331

days from illness onset to death was 20 days. One severe and one moderate case have

332

recovered. Patients were transferred to the designated hospital after being identified as having

≤ 100. One case developed multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),

Discussion

336

This is the first preliminary study evaluating descriptively the immunologic characteristics of

337

patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both clinical and epidemiological

338

features of patients with COVID-19 have recently been reported5-7,9. However, there is

339

insufficient knowledge of pathophysiological parameters as well as immunologic indicators to

340

understand the mechanism involved in COVID-19. Consistent with previous reports7, in this

341

present study, a male predominance in the incidence of COVID-19 has been noted similar to

342

that of SARS-CoV, indicating males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than

343

females. Older males (>50 years old), in particular those with chronic comorbidities may be

344

more likely to develop severe COVID-19, and associated with a high mortality (28.6% of

345

males aged >50 years old with comorbidities). The most common clinical manifestations at

346

onset of illness included fever, cough, fatigue and myalgia. Severe cases were more likely to

347

have dyspnea and significantly lower PaO2/FiO2, and to develop ARDS. In terms of

348

laboratory finding, leukocytosis (≥10× 10 /L) but lymphopenia (<0.8× 10 /L) were more

349

common in severe cases than moderate cases. ALT, LDH, D-dimer and inflammatory markers

350

including hsCRP and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases than moderate cases.

351

Plasma concentrations of both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines,

352

including IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 increased in the majority of severe cases and was

353

significantly higher than did those in moderate cases, suggesting cytokine storms might be

354

associated with disease severity.

355

Additionally, we also noted that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause a significant reduction in

356

peripheral blood lymphocytes and T cell subsets. Although the proportions of T cells subsets

357

in peripheral blood remained within the normal range in most patients, the prevalence of

358

decreasing CD4+T cell counts and CD8+T cell counts was considerably high in both severe

359

and moderate cases. It is notable that both the proportion and number of B cells were not

360

frequently decreased in these patients. More importantly, the number of CD4+T cells and

361

CD8+T cells was markedly lower in severe cases than moderate cases. Albeit diminished

362

CD8+ T cells, the proportion of HLA-DR+ expression on CD8+T cells over 35% was more

363

common in severe cases than those of moderate cases. The expression of HLA-DR on human

364

T cells has been regarded primarily as a marker of activated T cells. However, It has been

365

recently indicated that CD8+ HLA-DR+ T cells constitute to a natural subset of Treg and may

366

exert suppressive effect involving CTLA-4 signaling between neighboring T cells 10 . Besides,

367

six out of eight severe cases and none of moderate cases with available immunologic data

368

exhibited a broad, significant decline in all the lymphocyte subsets excluding B cells, with

369

total T lymphocyte counts below 400 × 106/L, CD8+T cells below 150 × 106/L, and NK cells

370

below<77 × 106/L, of these six patients, three (50%) eventually died, indicating that

371

SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with severe lymphopenia have high-risk of developing severe

372

COVID-19 and extremely high mortality. Moreover, the production of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells

373

but not CD8+T cells or NK cells tended to be lower in severe cases than moderate cases.

374

These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes,

375

particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in diminished number as well as their IFN-γ production,

376

which might be correlated with disease severity of COVID-19.

377

CD4+ T cells play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses, orchestrating the deletion

378

and amplification of immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells. CD4+ T cells facilitate

379

virus-specific antibody production via the T-dependent activation of B cells11. However, CD8+

380

T cells exert their effects mainly through two mechanisms, cytolytic activities against target

381

cells or cytokines secretion, including IFN-γ , TNF-α, and IL-2 as well as many chemokines12.

382

The production of IFN-γ is essential for the resistance against infection of various pathogens

383

such as virus, bacteria, and parasite13. As a major source of IFN-γ, the ability of T cells to

384

respond to infection is part of the adaptive immune response and takes days to develop a

385

prominent IFN-γ response.

386

The roles of T cell responses in the context of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection have

387

been previously studied. Likewise, patients who survived SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

388

infections usually had better immune responses than those who did not14. The immune system

389

plays an important role in both diseases, but it is differentially affected by the two viruses15. A

390

study in SARS-CoV mice model has shown that depletion of CD8+ T cells at the time of

391

infection does not affect viral replication or clearance. However, depletion of CD4+ T cells

392

leads to an enhanced immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of

393

SARS-CoV from the lungs, demonstrating the vital role of CD4+ T but not CD8+ T cells in

394

primary SARS-CoV infection

395

demonstrated that the majority of infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium

396

are CD8+ T cells that play an important role in virus clearance as well as in immune-mediated

397

injury17. After comparing T cell-deficient mice and B cell-deficient mice, it is found that T

398

cells are able to survive and kill virus-infected cells in the MERS-CoV infected lung 18. These

399

data highlight the importance of T lymphocytes, in particular, CD4+ T cells but not B cells in

400

controlling and finetuning the pathogenesis and outcomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

401

infection.

402

Hin Chu et al demonstrated that MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV can efficiently infect T cells

403

from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs, and induce apoptosis in T cells,

404

which involves the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. This may

405

partly explain the lymphopenia observed in MERS-CoV-infected patients19. The inability of

406

the SARS-CoV to infect T cells may be ascribed to the lower expression of the SARS-CoV

407

receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression (ACE2) in T cells15,19. Several recent

408

structural analyses predict that SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 as its host receptor 20. Therefore,

409

these findings indicate that T cells might not be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and

410

warrants further investigation. Nevertheless, similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV

411

can also significantly decrease peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets and it was

412

related to the onset of illness 21. Several potential mechanisms may be involved, including the

413

development of auto-immune antibodies or immune complexes triggered by viral infection,

414

directly infecting and promoting the growth inhibition and apoptosis of hematopoietic stem

415

and progenitor cells, as well as the use of glucocorticoids, which may account for the decrease

416

of lymphocytes in some SARS patients22.

417

Although nothing is known about mechanism underlying the lymphopenia caused by

418

SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this present study, some patients were administered

419

methylprednisolone, the average dosage was a bit higher in severe cases (40-80mg once a day)

420

than moderate cases (20-40mg once a day). Since corticosteroids have a profound effect on

421

circulating T lymphocytes, which may involve their movement out of the intra-vascular

16

. A Chinese study in SARS-CoV-infected patients has

422

compartment23. In this study, we could not exclude the possibility that some of the

423

lymphopenia may be associated with use of steroids, but it does not account for all the cases,

424

and certainly not for the lymphopenia at the initial presentation. Further research is required

425

to determine the effects of corticosteroid on lymphocytes in the patient with COVID-19.

426

Our study has some limitations. First of all, we mainly evaluated the number of T cell subsets

427

and NK cells as well as their IFN-γ production, the function of these cells, and the role of

428

activated macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrating lung parenchyma remain unclear. Second,

429

this study only included a small number of patients, thus the results should be interpreted with

430

caution, and statistical non-significance may not rule out difference between severe and

431

moderate cases. Third, since data regarding the viremia profile of SARS-CoV-2 are not

432

available, further studies are needed to investigate the correlation between the virus load

433

kinetics and the dynamics of cellular immune responses. Clarification of these questions will

434

allow further dissection of the complex SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, with potential

435

implications for the development of therapeutics and vaccines.

436

In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, especially

437

CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which

438

may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early

439

immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may

440

serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19. Gaining a deeper understanding of the

441

factors that influence lymphocytes particularly CD4+T cell counts and their decrease in

442

patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is of importance for clinical management of COVID-19.
