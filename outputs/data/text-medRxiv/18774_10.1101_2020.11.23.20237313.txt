Abstract
Objectives: Diagnostic work-up following any COVID-19 associated symptom will lead to
extensive testing, potentially overwhelming laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding
negative results. We aimed to identify optimal symptom combinations to capture most cases
using fewer tests with implications for COVID-19 vaccine developers across different resource
settings and public health.
Methods: UK and US users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study app who reported new-onset
symptoms and an RT-PCR test within seven days of symptom onset were included. Sensitivity,
specificity, and number of RT-PCR tests needed to identify one case (test per case [TPC]) were
calculated for different symptom combinations. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm was
applied to generate combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.
Findings: UK and US cohorts included 122,305 (1,202 positives) and 3,162 (79 positive)
individuals. Within three days of symptom onset, the COVID-19 specific symptom
combination (cough, dyspnoea, fever, anosmia/ageusia) identified 69% of cases requiring 47
TPC. The combination with highest sensitivity (fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea,
headache, sore throat) identified 96% cases requiring 96 TPC.
Interpretation: We confirmed the significance of COVID-19 specific symptoms for triggering
RT-PCR and identified additional symptom combinations with optimal trade-offs between
sensitivity and specificity that maximize case capture given different resource settings.

Introduction
Safe and effective vaccines represent the most promising intervention to prevent morbidity and
mortality during the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic.1,2 Positive results have
recently emerged from three ongoing vaccine efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines.3-5
However, further vaccines are required to meet global demand, and vaccines currently in early
development may result in better tolerability profiles, scalability, impact on viral shedding, and
may be suitable to specific population subgroups. Thus, further important COVID-19 vaccine
efficacy trials are predicted to start soon. In a clinical trial, diagnostic testing of suspected cases
(e.g., reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) could be triggered by the presence of any COVID19 associated symptom. A household survey in the United Kingdom (UK) showed that fever,
cough, anosmia, and ageusia were present on the day of testing in only 60% of symptomatic,
RT-PCR positive individuals, implying that other less specific signs/symptoms associated with
COVID-19 occur in a substantial number of patients.6 The signs/symptoms associated with
COVID-19 are extensive and overlap with those of other common viral infections.7,8 Thus,
diagnostic work-up following any COVID-19 associated symptom may lead to indiscriminate
testing and potentially overwhelm laboratory capacity whilst primarily yielding negative
results.
Identification of an efficient symptom combination to trigger diagnostic work-up that will
capture the majority of COVID-19 cases using the lowest possible number of tests would
enable optimum use of laboratory and financial resources in future vaccine efficacy trials. This
would also be of wider benefit in public health settings for the early detection of symptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such data are scant and the triggering symptoms vary between
publicly available vaccine efficacy trial protocols.9-15
We simulate COVID-19 case finding in a trial population using a community-based,
prospective, observational cohort study. Data from UK COVID Symptom Study app

16

users

were used to quantify how much individual COVID-19 symptoms contribute to COVID-19
case finding and to generate symptom combinations with optimal trade-offs between sensitivity
and specificity that maximise the capture of RT-PCR positive cases given different laboratory
capacities. The findings were replicated in a dataset of COVID Symptom Study app users in
the United States (US).

Material
Study design and data source
A community-based cohort study was carried out using data from the COVID Symptom Study
app, a free smartphone app launched at the end of March 2020 and developed by Zoe Global
(London, UK) in collaboration with King’s College London (London, UK) and Massachusetts
General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA).16 Users from UK and US report baseline demographic
information, data on comorbidities and COVID-19 testing results, and are encouraged to selfreport a set of pre-specified symptoms on a daily basis to enable collection of longitudinal
information on incident symptoms. This study was approved by the Partners Human Research
Committee (Protocol 2020P000909) and King’s College London ethics committee (REMAS
ID 18210, LRS-19/20-18210).
Study population
Individuals were included in the study if they met the following criteria: 1) aged≥18 years, 2)
reported developing any symptom between March 24th and September 15th, 2020, and 3)
entered a valid RT-PCR test result within the first seven days of symptom onset. App users
who recorded a history of COVID-19 were excluded. Data were frozen and extracted on
October 21st, 2020. UK participants served as a discovery cohort, which was randomly split
into training and validation datasets of equal size. US participants served as a replication cohort
to confirm the generalisability of the results. Both cohorts were stratified by age (18-54 and
≥55 years) to align with age strata in ongoing COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials.
Methods
Data analyses
Symptoms recorded within three and seven days of symptom onset were included in the
analyses (see Supplementary Table 1 for complete list of symptoms and corresponding
questions participants were asked). Analysis of symptoms within the first three days is key to
enable testing for SARS-CoV-2 soon after symptom onset while viral load is highest. An
additional buffer for inclusion of symptoms within seven days was also used, which may be
important to detect development of lower respiratory tract signs indicative of pneumonia.
Anosmia and ageusia were considered one symptom in the reporting app.

Participants were classified as symptom-screening positive when they recorded at least one of
the symptoms in the symptom combination concerned. This was compared with self-reported
RT-PCR results considered the gold standard for COVID-19 case detection. If multiple positive
RT-PCR test results were recorded for an individual, only the first was included.
A COVID-19 case was defined as a newly symptomatic individual with a first ever positive
RT-PCR test result. For individual symptoms or symptom combinations, three evaluation
parameters were considered, taking disease status to be a positive RT-PCR test: 1) sensitivity,
computed as the percentage of COVID-19 positive individuals correctly identified, 2)
specificity, calculated as the percentage of individuals correctly classified as COVID-19
negative, and 3) the reciprocal of precision, that is the number of RT-PCR tests needed to
identify one RT-PCR positive COVID-19 case (i.e. Tests Per Case [TPC]).

Multi-objective evolutionary optimization
As sensitivity and specificity of a given symptom combination represent conflicting objectives,
a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) was used to generate optimal symptom
combinations from the data, each characterised by a good trade-off between specificity and
sensitivity. Optimisation problems with multiple objectives have a set of optimal solutions (i.e.,
Pareto-optimal solutions) rather than one single optimal solution. No Pareto-optimal solution
is better than the other without further information on the specific objective to be addressed.
For MOEA, we employed the well-known NSGAII 17 developed in the python package pymoo
v0.4.2.1. The optimal set of parameters were derived through experimenting with different
values (see Supplementary Table 2 for parameter information). The training and validation
datasets were used to generate and evaluate the Pareto-optimal symptom combinations
(referred to as data-inferred symptom combinations).

Evaluation of individual symptoms and symptom combinations
Sensitivity, specificity, and TPC were evaluated for each individual symptom and symptom
combinations using the validation dataset. We considered symptom combinations derived from
both clinical experience/guidance (i.e., clinically inferred symptom combinations) and
generated from the data using the MOEA (i.e., data-inferred symptom combinations). All
evaluations were repeated on the US-replication cohort and on the data stratified by age.

For clinically-inferred symptom combinations we evaluated: 1) respiratory symptoms (cough,
dyspnoea), 2) WHO-defined pneumonia symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, fever), 3) COVID-19
specific symptoms as defined by Public Health England (PHE) (fever, cough, dyspnoea,
anosmia/ageusia), and 4) extended symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnoea, anosmia/ageusia,
fatigue, headache). This latter category was added post-hoc after exploration of the app data
indicated high sensitivity of headache and fatigue in other contexts.18
Regarding data-inferred symptom combinations, among all the generated combinations, we
evaluated the one with highest sensitivity, the one with a sensitivity of ~90%, and the one
characterised by a specificity of ~50%, which is of interest from a clinical standpoint.
Results
A total of 122,305 individuals were included in the UK-discovery cohort, of which 1,202 tested
COVID-19 positive. In the US-replication cohort, 3,162 individuals were included, of which
79 tested COVID-19 positive. The patient selection flow charts are displayed in
Supplementary Figure 1 and 2. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the
population.

Evaluation of individual symptoms
The sensitivity, specificity, and TPC for each individual symptom reported within three and
seven days of symptom onset are displayed in Table 2. Using the UK-discovery cohort, the
individual symptoms with the highest sensitivity in both three- and seven-day analyses were
headache and fatigue (67% and 65% for three-day analysis and 75% and 78% for seven-day
analyses). Similar results were obtained with data from the US-replication cohort and when
data were stratified by age. The sensitivity of anosmia/ageusia in the UK-discovery cohort was
only 22% and 49% in the three- and seven days analyses, respectively. Anosmia/ageusia,
however, had the lowest TPC (20 and 10 for three- and seven-day analyses, respectively).

These results are confirmed by Figure 1, which displays the frequency of the symptoms for
the UK-discovery cohort for both COVID-19 positive and negative cases.

(right) cases
Evaluation of symptom combinations
The sensitivity, specificity, and TPC of both clinically- and data-inferred symptom
combinations, computed on the UK-validation and US-replication cohorts, and reported within
three and seven days of symptom onset are displayed in Table 3.
Cough or dyspnoea were reported by 46% of individuals positive for COVID-19 within the
first three days of symptom onset. The addition of fever (i.e., WHO-defined pneumonia
symptom combination) increased sensitivity to 60%, while the further addition of
anosmia/ageusia (i.e., PHE COVID-19 specific symptom combination) increased sensitivity to
69%. When headache and fatigue are added, (i.e., extended symptom combination) the
proportion of COVID-19 cases identified increased to 92% but the TPC doubled compared to
the respiratory symptom combination (42 versus 85). Similarly, within seven days of symptom
onset, COVID-19 specific and extended symptom combination were reported in 84% and 97%
of RT-PCR positive cases, at the cost of 42 and 81 TPC, respectively. Similar results were
obtained when data were stratified by age. The sensitivity estimates from the US-replication

Among data-inferred symptom combinations, the one with highest sensitivity (fatigue,
anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, and sore throat) identified 96% and 99% of RTPCR positive COVID-19 cases and required 96 and 92 TPC in the three- and seven-day
analyses, respectively. The sensitivity results were similar for the US-replication cohort and by
age. However, the number of tests needed for those aged ≥55 years increased by 30% for both
the three-day and seven-day analyses.

recorded within three days of onset. Diarrhoea as an individual symptom was not predictive of
a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR result but became predictive when associated with other

All the Pareto-optimal symptom combinations generated by the MOEA are displayed in Figure
3. Each point (solution) of the Pareto corresponds to a certain symptom combination with a
related sensitivity, specificity, and TPC (see Supplementary Table 4 and 5 for the complete
list of solutions for three- and seven-day analyses, respectively). These generated symptom
combinations achieved similar values of sensitivity and specificity for the UK-training, UKvalidation, and US-replication cohorts, thus confirming the validity of this methodology.
Moreover, results were also confirmed for the two age groups.
Figure 4 displays the frequency of symptoms selected in symptom combinations with a
sensitivity ≥90%. Fatigue, cough, and anosmia/ageusia were present in most symptom
combinations with high specificity. Diarrhoea was selected ~60% of the time for the three-day
analyses.

Discussion
We present data from, what is to our knowledge, the largest community-based COVID-19
symptom cohort study with the aim to quantify the contribution of various symptoms and
symptom combinations associated with COVID-19 to RT-PCR positive case-finding. COVID19 symptoms and RT-PCR test results were collected prospectively which allowed us to select

newly symptomatic individuals and simulate a clinical trial situation in which RT-PCR tests
are typically conducted within three days after symptom onset. We confirm the significance of
symptoms (fever, cough, anosmia/ageusia) widely considered important for triggering a RTPCR test and extend this to include additional symptoms (fatigue, sore throat, headache,
diarrhoea). The proposed approach enables the selection of symptom combinations to
maximise the capture of cases without overwhelming laboratory capacity. Our findings may
help to optimise the choice of triggering symptoms for diagnostic work-up in COVID-19
vaccine efficacy trials or in a wider public health setting.
In an efficacy trial, it is important to capture all COVID-19 cases with pulmonary involvement
as signs/symptoms of pneumonia define moderate or severe COVID-19. Therefore, the
signs/symptoms that characterise WHO-defined COVID-19 pneumonia (fever, cough,
dyspnoea, tachypnoea) should trigger diagnostic work-up in a trial participant.19 Additionally,
anosmia/ageusia have the highest sensitivity of all reported COVID-19 symptoms.9,20
Although our findings support the inclusion of these COVID-19 specific symptoms, they also
show that this combination correctly identified only 69% and 83% of COVID-19 cases in the
three- and seven-days analyses. This has important implications in terms of cases missed as the
COVID-specific symptoms align with the current PHE definition of a possible COVID-19
case.21 We found that the addition of headache and fatigue (i.e., extended symptoms) increased
the proportion of COVID-19 cases correctly identified to 92% but also almost doubled the TPC
(from 47 to 85). Thus, an increase in sensitivity comes at a cost.
Application of MOEA identified fatigue, anosmia/ageusia, cough, diarrhoea, headache, and
sore throat as the symptom combination with the highest sensitivity in three- and seven-day
analyses. Diarrhoea and sore throat were identified as symptoms that may increase case finding
in an efficient way, in addition to those symptoms already considered important for triggering
an RT-PCR test. In situations where there is a limited testing capacity, we provide a range of
optimal symptom combinations that could be used, given different target numbers of TPC
identified. This finding may prove useful for COVID-19 vaccine developers or in public health
settings when deciding which symptoms should trigger testing to optimise financial and
logistical resource utilisation. Importantly, all the symptoms that constitute the combination
with the highest sensitivity have been included as triggering symptoms in publicly available
clinical trial protocols of ongoing vaccine efficacy trials.9-14

Few studies have been published that assess COVID-19 symptoms in community-based
cohorts. Menni et al. presented results using data generated from this COVID-19 Symptom
Study app; however, the aim was different and only data from March-April 2020 were
included.22 We extend these data to September 2020 and, importantly, consider the results from
the perspective of a potential COVID-19 vaccine developer. Menni et al. suggest
anosmia/ageusia, fatigue, persistent cough, and loss of appetite might together identify
individuals with COVID-19.22 A separate COVID-19 symptom app from Germany suggests
nausea and vomiting have a stronger predictive value for COVID-19 infection than symptoms
such as sore throat or persistent cough.23 Thus, both studies identify gastrointestinal symptoms
as important in identifying cases of COVID-19. Our study reports similar findings with
diarrhoea found to be important to case finding. More recently, in another community-based
observational study, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were
reported for retrospectively collected symptoms and symptom combinations that occurred
during the 14-day period prior to screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a US seroprevalence
study.24 The two symptom clusters most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were: 1)
ageusia, anosmia, and fever, and 2) shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain. In our study,
dyspnoea was rarely and chest pain never selected as part of an efficient symptom combination
likely due to dyspnoea often occurring later in the disease course.25 The sensitivity of dyspnoea
increased in the seven-day compared to three-day analyses. However, the importance of
dyspnoea as a symptom of pulmonary involvement makes it a critical triggering symptom in
vaccine efficacy trials. Tachypnoea, which is included in the WHO-defined definition for
pneumonia, was not captured as a symptom in the app per se; however, it likely co-occurs with
dyspnoea. Headache and diarrhoea were more likely to be selected in the three-day scenario
and fever during the seven-day scenario again, reflecting different timings of symptoms in the
disease course.
The sensitivity of symptoms and various clinically inferred symptom combinations were
similar for the age groups (18-54 and ≥55 years); however, the TPC was higher in the ≥55 years
age group. This suggests self-reporting may work better for younger than older individuals.
The sensitivity, specificity, and TPC computed on the US-replication cohort were higher than
for the UK-discovery cohort possibly due to different testing practices and public health
measures adopted in each country. It will be important for these findings to be validated in lowand middle-income country (LMIC) settings as COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials are likely to
be conducted in high income countries as well as LMICs. Vaccine developers should take into

account regional considerations such as background incidence of co-infection and other trialrelated aspects when interpreting these results.
This study has many strengths, including the large sample size and cost-effectiveness of the
data source. Also, our study is community-based and adds important data as most studies that
have assessed symptoms in COVID-19 have involved hospital-based populations. Some
limitations, however, also need consideration. First, the results are based on data self-reported
through a mobile app and therefore biased towards people with smartphone access. However,
the app included a feature to enable reporting on behalf of someone else given their consent.
Second, reported test results were not externally verified, however, antigen tests were not
available during the study period, thus minimising risk of participant confusion regarding
precise swab tests. As the precise RT-PCR used was not recorded and likely varied between
participants, false positive rates were not known and results taken at face value. A further
limitation is that app users may not be representative of the wider population. Finally, these
data were generated in the spring and summer months when the incidence of concurrent
respiratory infections (e.g., influenza) is low. The latter may have implications for trials
conducted in winter.
In summary, we confirm the significance of symptoms widely recommended for triggering RTPCR and identified additional symptom combinations to enable efficient trade-off between the
number of positive cases detected and tests needed. Our findings may help optimise the choice
of triggering symptoms for diagnostic work-up in COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials and also
have wider public health implications.
