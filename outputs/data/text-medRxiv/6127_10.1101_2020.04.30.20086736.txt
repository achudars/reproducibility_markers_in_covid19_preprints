ABSTRACT
Background: Early studies of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated markedly
dysregulated coagulation and a high risk of morbid arterial and venous thrombotic events. While
elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been
described in patients with COVID-19, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis
remains unknown.
Objectives: To elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in
COVID-19-associated thrombosis.

Patients/Methods: This is a retrospective, case-control study of patients hospitalized with
COVID-19 who developed thrombosis (n=11), as compared with gender- and age-matched
COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis (n=33). In addition to capturing clinical data, we
measured remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated
histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera.
Results: The majority of patients (9/11) were receiving at least prophylactic doses of
heparinoids at the time thrombosis was diagnosed. As compared with controls, patients with
COVID-19-associated thrombosis had significantly higher blood levels of markers of NETs (cellfree DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil activation
(calprotectin). The thrombosis group also had higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and
platelets, but not troponin or neutrophils. Finally, there were strong associations between
markers of hyperactive neutrophils (calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer.

Conclusion: Elevated levels of neutrophil activation and NET formation in patients hospitalized
with COVID-19 are associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic complications. These
observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship
between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the disease known as
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It most commonly presents with influenza-like illness
and viral pneumonia, but in its most severe manifestation progresses to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure [1]. To date the viral pandemic has resulted
in millions of infections worldwide (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

In COVID-19, elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict severe respiratory disease and
unfavorable outcomes [2, 3]. Neutrophil-derived neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) play a
pathogenic role in many thrombo-inflammatory states including sepsis [4, 5], thrombosis [6-8],
and respiratory failure [9, 10]. NETs are extracellular webs of chromatin and microbicidal
proteins that are an evolutionarily conserved aspect of innate immune host-defense [11];
however, NETs also have potential to initiate and propagate inflammation and thrombosis.
NETs deliver a variety of oxidant enzymes to the extracellular space, including
myeloperoxidase, NADPH oxidase, and nitric oxide synthase, while also serving as a source of
extracellular histones that carry significant cytotoxic potential. NETs drive cardiovascular
disease by propagating inflammation in vessel walls [12]. Furthermore, when formed
intravascularly, NETs can occlude arteries [13], veins [14], and microscopic vessels [15]. Early
studies of COVID-19 suggest a high risk of morbid arterial events [16], and the risk of venous
thromboembolism (VTE) is increasingly revealing itself as more data become available [17].

Descriptive and mechanistic studies to date that examine COVID-19 pathophysiology have
focused on monocytes and lymphocytes more so than neutrophils and their effector products.
Our group recently reported high levels of NETs in 50 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 as
compared with healthy controls [18]. Here, we describe 11 cases of thrombosis in patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 and demonstrate an association with neutrophil hyperactivity and
NET release.

METHODS
Human samples for NETs analysis. All 44 patients studied here had a confirmed COVID-19
diagnosis based on FDA-approved DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct real-time RTPCR assay. Blood was collected into serum separator tubes by a trained hospital phlebotomist.
After completion of biochemical testing ordered by the clinician, the remaining serum was stored
at 4°C for 4 to 48 hours before it was deemed “discarded” and released to the research
laboratory. Serum samples were immediately divided into small aliquots and stored at -80°C
until the time of testing. This study complied with all relevant ethical regulations, and was
approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (HUM00179409), which
waived the requirement for informed consent given the discarded nature of the samples.

Quantification of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin). Calprotectin levels were measured with the
Human S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer DuoSet ELISA (DY8226-05, R&D Systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantification of cell-free DNA. Cell-free DNA was quantified in sera using the Quant-iT
PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, P11496) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes. Myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes were
quantified similarly to what has been previously described [19]. This protocol used several
reagents from the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche). First, a high-binding EIA/RIA 96-well
plate (Costar) was coated overnight at 4ºC with anti-human myeloperoxidase antibody (Bio-Rad
0400-0002), diluted to a concentration of 1 µg/ml in coating buffer (Cell Death kit). The plate
was washed two times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), and then blocked with 4%
bovine serum albumin in PBS (supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 hours at room
temperature. The plate was again washed five times, before incubating for 90 minutes at room
temperature with 10% serum or plasma in the aforementioned blocking buffer (without Tween
20). The plate was washed five times, and then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature
with 10x anti-DNA antibody (HRP-conjugated; from the Cell Death kit) diluted 1:100 in blocking
buffer. After five more washes, the plate was developed with 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate (Invitrogen) followed by a 2N sulfuric acid stop solution. Absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader
(BioTek). Data were normalized to in vitro-prepared NET standards included on every plate,
which were quantified based on their DNA content.

Quantification of citrullinated-histone H3. Citrullinated-histone H3 was quantified in sera
using the Citrullinated Histone H3 (Clone 11D3) ELISA Kit (Cayman, 501620) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis. When two groups were present, data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney
test. Correlations were tested by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Data analysis was with
GraphPad Prism software version 8. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

RESULTS
We identified 11 patients who developed a thrombotic event while admitted for treatment of
COVID-19 at a large academic medical center (Table 1). The events consisted of three strokes
and nine VTE events (Table 2). Nine were receiving at least prophylactic doses of heparinoids
at the time the event was diagnosed. The other two patients were found to have pulmonary
emboli on the day of admission (Table 2). Nine of the patients were receiving respiratory
support by mechanical ventilation at the time of the event. To date, eight have been discharged
from the hospital, two have died, and one remains hospitalized.

To better understand the extent to which patients diagnosed with thrombotic events differed
from other patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified a matched cohort of 33 patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 over the same month (Table 1). The control cohort was identical for
age and sex. The cohort was similar in terms of comorbidities and ultimate outcome (18% died
in the thrombosis group and 21% in the control group). For all 44 patients, we were able to
access a blood sample collected during their hospitalization. As it relates to diagnosis of the first
thrombotic event for each patient, six blood samples were banked within three days of event
diagnosis. Three were banked earlier (5, 7, and 12 days prior to event diagnosis) and two later
(both at 6 days). As compared with the control group, patients with a thrombotic event
demonstrated significantly higher levels of calprotectin, a marker of neutrophil activation (Figure
1A). Similarly, three different markers of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA
complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) were also markedly elevated in the thrombosis group
as compared with the matched controls (Figure 1B-D).

We then turned our attention to other clinical biomarkers that might associate with a thrombotic
event. The thrombosis group had higher levels of peak D-dimer (Figure 2A), but not troponin
(Figure 2B). Peak CRP and ferritin were also modestly higher in the thrombosis group (Figure
2C-2D). Interestingly, peak neutrophil levels did not differ between groups, but platelets were
significantly higher in patients who developed thrombosis (Figure 2E-F). Finally, we asked
whether there was an association between blood markers of neutrophil activation (such as
calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer within this cohort of COVID-19 patients (n=44).
Despite the small number of patients, there were strong correlations between peak D-dimer and
both calprotectin and cell free DNA (Figure 3A-B).

DISCUSSION
Hyperactivity of the coagulation system is a common finding of severe COVID-19 [20]. Indeed,
many patients have a profile to suggest a prothrombotic diathesis including high levels of fibrin
degradation products (D-dimer), elevated fibrinogen levels, and low antithrombin levels [20, 21].
We recently characterized the blood of 50 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and found
significantly elevated levels of NETs as compared with healthy controls [18]. Here, we extend
that analysis by demonstrating particularly high levels of NETs in a subgroup of COVID-19
patients diagnosed with a thrombotic event. Given the known link between NETs and
thrombosis in many inflammatory conditions, these data suggest that the role of NETs in
COVID-19-associated thrombophilia warrants systematic investigation.

Intravascular NET release is responsible for initiation and accretion of thrombotic events in
arteries, veins, and microvessels, where thrombotic disease can drive end-organ damage in
lungs, heart, kidneys, and other organs[22, 23]. Mechanistically, DNA in NETs may directly
activate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation[24], while NETs also present tissue factor to initiate
the intrinsic pathway[25]. Serine proteases in NETs such as neutrophil elastase release brakes
on coagulation by proteolyzing various tissue factor pathway inhibitors [26]. Bidirectional
interplay between NETs and platelets might also be critical for COVID-19-associated thrombosis
as has been characterized in a variety of disease models [23, 24].

Approaches to combatting NETs [27-29] include the dismantling of NETs with
deoxyribonucleases and strategies that prevent initiation of NET release such as neutrophil
elastase inhibitors and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 inhibitors. As we await definitive antiviral
and immunologic solutions to the current pandemic, we posit that anti-neutrophil therapies may
be part of a personalized strategy for some individuals affected by COVID-19. Furthermore,
those patients with hyperactive neutrophils may be at particularly high risk for thrombotic events
and might therefore benefit from more aggressive anticoagulation while hospitalized.

Figure 1: Elevated levels of NETs in the blood of COVID-19 patients diagnosed with a
thrombotic event, as compared with matched controls. Serum was tested for calprotectin
(A), cell-free DNA (B), myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes (C), and citrullinated histone H3 (D).
N=33 for the control group and n=11 for the thrombosis group. Comparisons were by MannWhitney test; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, and ***p<0.001.

Figure 2: Association between peak levels of clinical biomarkers and diagnosis of a
thrombotic event. Clinical testing is reported for D-dimer (A), troponin (B), C-reactive protein
(C), ferritin (D), absolute neutrophil count (E), and absolute platelet count (F). N=33 for the
control group and n=11 for the thrombosis group. Comparisons were by Mann-Whitney test;
*p<0.05 and **p<0.01. Comparisons for peak troponin and peak neutrophil count were not
statistically significant.
