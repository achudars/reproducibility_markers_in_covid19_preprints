TITLE : Estimating COVID-19 Virus Prevalence from Records of Testing Rate and Test
Positivity.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: PCR testing for COVID-19 is not done at random but selectively on suspected
cases. This paper presents a method to estimate a “genuine Virus Prevalence” by quantifying
and removing the bias related to selective testing.
Methods: Data used are from nine (9) neighbouring countries in Western Europe that record
similar epidemic trends despite differences in Testing Rate. Regression analysis is used to
establish a relationship of declining Test Positivity with increased Testing Rate. By
extrapolating this trend to an “infinitely complete” Testing Rate, an unbiased Test Positivity
or “genuine Virus Prevalence” is computed. Via pairing of “genuine Virus Prevalence” with
Excess-Deaths, a “genuine Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) is also derived.
Results: Peak levels of “genuine Virus Prevalence” were around 0.5 to 2% during the 1st
epidemic “wave” (week 10 to week 20) and are approaching similar levels in the ongoing 2nd
“wave” (week 34 onward). “Genuine Virus Prevalence” estimates are close to reported
Seroprevalence in the studied countries with a correlation coefficient of 0.58. “Genuine” IFR
is found comparable to closed-community model IFR. Finally, results of community masstesting in Slovakia are within the estimated range of “genuine Virus Prevalence”.
Conclusions: Estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence” benchmark favourably to other
indications of virus prevalence suggesting the estimation method is robust and potentially
deployable beyond this initial dataset of countries. “Genuine Virus Prevalence” curves
suggest that during the 1st epidemic “wave”, curve flattening and waning happened at very
modest levels of infection spread, either naturally or facilitated by government measures.

MAIN TEXT

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Corona virus disease 2019
(COVID-19) reached the pandemic phase on March 11, 2020. As of October 22, 2020, it had
spread to more than 200 countries worldwide, leading to 41,333,175 registered infections and
1,132,869 deaths. As the pandemic evolved, countries implemented routine testing of
suspected cases using real-time RT-PCR test assays; initially for diagnostic and reporting
purpose but subsequently stepping-up the Testing Rate in an attempt to map community
spread of the virus and to guide containment measures like isolation of infected patients,
lockdown of neighbourhoods with a high number of reported cases, etc. Obviously the testing
was not deployed at random but primarily on suspected cases especially early in the epidemic
when test capacity was very limited. Because of this biased deployment of testing, the
reported percentage of positive tests (the so-called “Test Positivity”) is almost certainly
higher than the true percentage of infected members of the population (called “genuine Virus
Prevalence” throughout this paper). It is likely that as countries stepped up the testing beyond
a baseload of symptomatic patients to include groups with a likely lower virus prevalence
(mild cases, routine testing of e.g. travellers and sportsmen, etc.), this biasing effect reduced.
In other words, the biasing of Test Positivity due to biased testing may have reduced as
Testing Rate increased. A study of testing records from the US, relatively early in the
epidemic outbreak, already demonstrated and quantified some of this effect with a sampleselection model [1]. This paper attempts to quantify and remove sampling bias from reported
test results using a much larger European dataset covering a longer period, using regression
statistics similar to methods deployed before on Malaria survey data [2]. Estimates of
“genuine Virus Prevalence” are made by analysing the relationship between Testing Rate
(number of tests per week per capita) and Test Positivity over time, for a number of countries
within the same geographic realm and therefore subject to similar trends in virus prevalence.
2. Methods
This paper made use of open-domain data on COVID-19 reported Cases, Deaths, Testing
Rate and Test Positivity per country per week as published by the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC [3]). COVID-19 records available from this database
up to 16/10/2020 were used.
Nine (9) countries in Western Europe were selected for analysis considering neighbouring
geography and consistency in reporting of data especially of Testing Rate and Test Positivity.
The idea being that epidemic trajectories across these neighbouring countries might be
sufficiently similar to observe the impact of Testing Rate on reported Test Positivity, as the
testing rate in different countries was stepped up over time but with different pace and timing.
And to then quantify this impact through statistical regression analysis. A trend between Test

Positivity and Testing Rate was established and then used to correct individual Test Positivity
records (reports of Test Positivity per week per country) for the anticipated testing bias. This
correction involves extrapolation of the trend between Testing Rate and Test Positivity to an
“infinitely complete” Testing Rate of 100,000 tests per 100,000 people per week. Biascorrected records of Test Positivity are considered an estimate of what Test Positivity might
have been if testing were complete, in other words, how the genuine infection spread among
the community might have varied over time in the different countries. In this paper, this
entity is called “genuine Virus Prevalence”, calculated as follows:
genuine Virus Prevalence = reported Test Positivity / regressed_Positivity [TRa] *
regressed_Positivity [TR100,000]
Where:
regressed_Positivity refers to the relationship between Test Positivity and Testing
Rate, TRa being the actual Testing Rate reported for each country Test Positivity
record and TR100,000 being an “infinitely complete” testing rate of 100,000 tests per
100,000 persons per week.
In the above equation, regressed_Positivity [TR100,000] is shifted up (P10) or down (P90) by
1.28 times the regression Standard Error to define a confidence band around the best-fit
estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence”.
Estimated “genuine Virus Prevalence” per week and per country is considered indicative of
the number of newly detected infections in that week rather than the total number of active
infections (new plus existing still active infections). Reason being, the weekly PCR Test
Positivity data from which “genuine Virus Prevalence” is derived, presumably record only
the new active infections confirmed for each week (CDC recommends not to subject cases
with a confirmed positive test result to another PCR for some three months following
recovery [4]).
To validate the estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence”, they were compared against
available estimates of COVID-19 Seroprevalence for the studied countries, mostly from
blood plasma studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The difference in reporting period needs to be
taken into consideration. Whilst “genuine Virus Prevalence” is like an “instantaneous”
measure of virus prevalence as it is based on active infections seen by PCR testing,
Seroprevalence data reflects antibody response to either active or historic infections that may
date back several months [13]. In this paper, it is assumed that the average antibody residence
time is about three months (12 weeks). Therefore, for each Seroprevalence report the
cumulative “genuine Virus Prevalence” over the reporting period plus the 12 weeks
preceding it, is reflected against the Seroprevalence percentage.
This study also paired estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence” per week per country, with
estimates of COVID-19 fatality per week per country, to yield a “genuine” Infection Fatality
Rate (IFR). In view of the general belief that officially recorded numbers of confirmed

COVID-19 Deaths likely underestimate the true fatality impact of COVID-19 due to a variety
of diagnosis and reporting issues [14], [15], Excess Deaths per country per week were used
instead. Excess Deaths were extracted for the 1st epidemic “wave” only (defined in this
instance as the period from 15th March to 7th July 2020) to avoid any bias due to
incompleteness of Excess Deaths data for recent weeks, and compared to “genuine virus
prevalence” for the same period. Source of data was the Our World In Data website [15] and
data was downloaded as of 30/10/2020. “Genuine” IFR values were then benchmarked
against IFR estimates from a closed-community outbreak study: the Diamond Princess (DP)
cruise ship [16]. Because of the strong age-dependency of IFR shown by the DP study [16]
and by the confirmed COVID-19 death statistics broken down by age, IFR estimates were
corrected for the differences in age breakdown between the DP closed-community and each
individual European country, using demographics data obtained from the UNdata website
[17] (downloaded as of 16/10/2020). This comparison of “genuine IFR” against closedcommunity IFR comprises a second attempt of results validation.
A final benchmarking of “genuine Virus Prevalence” estimates is done against results of
mass-testing of the Slovakia population at end of Week 43 [18]. To facilitate this
benchmarking, Testing Rate and Test Positivity data for that week were obtained from the
Slovak Municipal health department [19], complementing the records of earlier weeks
obtained from ECDC [3].

3. Results
3.1. Estimating Genuine Virus Prevalence
All of the nine European countries record a similar two “waves” epidemic trajectory
comprising a 1st “wave” in week 10 to week 20 and a 2nd “wave” from about week 34
onward. This is evident in both the number of reported Cases as well as in the % of Positive
test outcomes (“Test Positivity Rate”). Similarity in epidemic trends is despite the Testing
Rate (number of tests per week per capita) being quite different from one country to another.
For example, Portugal roughly doubled its Testing Rate from about 690 tests per 100,000
population per week around the peak of the 1st epidemic “wave” (week 15-16), to 1,440 in the
ongoing 2nd “wave” (week 40). Whilst over the same period, United Kingdom stepped up its
testing more than ten-fold: from 150 test per 100,000 population per week in week 15-16, to
2,710 in week 40. Differences in Testing Rate over time and between countries are likely to
reflect a varying degree of test selectivity bias on recorded Positivity.
A weighted average of Test Positivity across all countries was computed and used to quantify
the differences in Test Positivity in different countries, over time and relative to cross-country
trend. Differences in Test Positivity between countries may reflect a variety of things
including genuine differences in the spread of COVID-19 among the population, testing
protocol, etc etc., but certainly inclusive of differences in test-selectivity “bias” due to
different Testing Rate. To demonstrate this, Figure 1 cross-plotted the difference between

individual-country Test Positivity and the cross-country-average Test Positivity, against
Testing Rate. Note that the difference is expressed as a ratio (in other words, the Y-axis of
Figure 1 shows individual-country Test Positivity over cross-country-average Test Positivity).
As expected, there is a clear trend of decreasing Test Positivity with increased Testing Rate.
A best-fit relationship was computed through regression analysis as shown in Figure 1. Given
there are many other factors that may influence the difference in test Positivity between
countries and hence it cannot be expected that all differences are explained by Testing Rate,
the author considers the observed Correlation Coefficient (R2) of 0.215 as statistically
significant.
Figure 2 shows trajectories of the best-estimate of “genuine Virus Prevalence”: Test
Positivity corrected for suspected test-selectivity bias. As explained in the Methods section of
this paper, correction was done by extrapolating the regressed trend between Testing Rate
and Test Positivity (Figure 1) to an infinitely complete Test Rate of 100,000 tests per 100,000
population per week. Peak levels of “genuine Virus Prevalence” were around 0.5 to 2%
during the 1st epidemic “wave”, depending on the country, and are approaching similar levels
in the ongoing 2nd epidemic “wave”. Obviously these values are per-country averages and it
is possible that at individual epidemic-outbreak localities, the true virus prevalence might
have been considerably higher. The author believes that “genuine Virus Prevalence” may be a
fair reflection of the degree of community spread of COVID-19 infections. Next paragraphs
will validate this hypothesis by comparing “genuine Virus Prevalence” with independent
indicators of prevalence.
3.2. Genuine Virus Prevalence versus Seroprevalence
Table 1 shows a benchmarking of “genuine Virus Prevalence” estimates against
Seroprevalence data available for the studied countries. As explained, reported
Seroprevalence reflects antibody response to active plus historic infections over a
considerable time period (this paper assumed 12 weeks on average), Therefore, Table 1
compares Seroprevalence percentages against cumulative “genuine Virus Prevalence” over
the 12 weeks preceding the Seroprevalence reporting date. Seroprevalence is generally
somewhat lower than the equivalent best estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence” but the
difference is not much. 86% of the Seroprevalence data fall within the P90-P10 confidence
band of “genuine Virus Prevalence”. The correlation coefficient (R2) between Seroprevalence
and cumulative “genuine Virus Prevalence” is 0.58. Figure 4 illustrates the degree of
correspondence between these two independent measures of community virus-spread.

3.3. Genuine Infection Fatality Rate
Estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence” (which are, as explained in the Methods section,
believed to reflect the number of new active infections reported in a week) were converted to
cumulative and then paired with estimates of Excess Deaths per week and per country, to
yield “genuine” IFR estimates (Table 2). As explained, Excess Deaths were extracted and
used to estimate IFR for the period 15th March to 7th July only (the 1st epidemic “wave”).
Note that no Excess Deaths data was available for Ireland. With the exception of Belgium
and Denmark, Excess Death numbers are higher than the confirmed COVID-19 Deaths and in
some instances, considerably higher (Table 2).
Compared to uncorrected Case Fatality Rate (uCFR) estimates derived from pairing the
cumulative number of confirmed Cases with Excess Deaths per country, “genuine” IFR
estimates are between 13 to 25 times lower. Most of the “best” estimates of “genuine IFR”
are relatively close to closed-community model IFR [16] (Table 2). 75% of the model-IFR
estimates fall within the P90-P10 confidence band of “genuine IFR”.

3.4. Genuine Virus Prevalence versus Slovakia Mass Rapid-Testing
Slovakia recently became the first country to conduct mass testing of its population to
estimate the scale of COVID-19 community spread. A total of 3,625,322 Slovaks over the
age of nine were given antigen swab tests over the weekend of 31/10 to 1/11; 38,359 (1.06%)
tested positive [18]. In addition, during the same week as the mass rapid testing Slovakia also
conducted a total of 112,952 PCR tests of which 14.8% positive. The total number of newly
detected cases for week 43 is therefore 55,033 on 3,738,274 tests (1.48% Positivity).
Slovakia is not included in the nine countries to which this paper fitted the equations for
estimating “genuine Virus Prevalence” from records of Test Positivity and Testing Rate, but
it is geographically near the analysed countries and recording similar epidemic trends.
Therefore, this paper deployed the same methodology as used for the other countries to
compute a “Genuine Virus Prevalence” for Slovakia. Figure 4 shows the “genuine Virus
Prevalence” curve against the community-scale rapid testing result. The range in “genuine
Virus Prevalence” (from bias-corrected PCR Test Positivity only) estimated for Slovakia in
Week 43 is 0.92% / 2.21% / 5.34% (P90 / Best / P10) which is reasonably close to the mass
testing findings.

4. Discussion
4.1. Validation of “genuine Virus Prevalence” estimates
This paper presented a relatively simple and straightforward method of estimating “genuine
Virus Prevalence” based on records of Test Positivity and Testing Rate over time. Three
attempts of results validation were presented namely 1) by comparison of “genuine Virus
Prevalence” against Seroprevalence data, 2) via estimation of “genuine IFR” which was then
cross-compared against closed-community IFR, and 3) by estimating “genuine Virus
Prevalence” for Slovakia and then comparing the outcome with results of the recent
community mass-testing in that country. Paragraphs below discuss whether the validation
results can be considered favourable.
4.1.1. Validation against Seroprevalence
Differences between Seroprevalence for certain countries and cumulative “genuine Virus
Prevalence” in the 12 weeks prior to Seroprevalence reporting, are generally quite small
(Table 1) and the R2 of 0.58 is suggestive of a significant correlation (Figure 4). The fact that
"genuine prevalence” is generally somewhat higher than reported Seroprevalence is
unsurprising. Seroprevalence studies are mostly using blood-bank data that is likely biased
towards asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Symptomatic patients would not be allowed as
blood donors during or shortly after suffering from the disease.
Uncertainty on the exact duration of test-detectable antibody response following an infection
may also explain some of the observed discrepancy between Seroprevalence and equivalent
estimates of “genuine Virus Prevalence”. If in reality the antibody count in some patients

wanes to undetectable in less than 12 weeks, it means that for a fair comparison “genuine
Virus Prevalence” should be summed over a period of less than 12 weeks and/or with a
tapering window. In any case, such would lower the “genuine Virus Prevalence” numbers
and bring them even closer to Seroprevalence.
All in all, the comparison between “genuine Virus Prevalence” and Seroprevalence is
considered favourable.
4.1.2. Validation via Infection Fatality Rate
“Genuine” IFR values computed from the pairing of “genuine Virus Prevalence” with Excess
Deaths are reasonably close to closed-community model IFR (Table 2), albeit slightly lower.
The author identified at least two factors that can explain why “genuine” IFR estimates are on
the low side compared to model IFR. Firstly, given the nature of the underlying PCR Test
Positivity this paper assumes that “genuine Virus Prevalence” (per week, per country) is
reflective of the newly discovered COVID-19 cases in that week. If this assumption is not
entirely correct and in reality, “genuine Virus Prevalence” reflects a mix of new and existing
cases, it means that the true number of new cases per week is less than the “genuine Virus
Prevalence”. Such would reduce the cumulative number of cases and consequently, increase
the IFR. A second, alternative explanation could be that the closed-community IFR models
are based on observations early in the pandemic. Since then, insights in the disease and
effectiveness of treatment methods have evolved. It is entirely possible that some of this
progress is reflected in a genuine drop in IFR from the current data compared to early-stage
datasets like the Diamond Princess cruise-ship.
Given these considerations and interpretation uncertainties, this author believes that the
match between “genuine” IFR and closed-community model IFR is close enough to conclude
that the “genuine” IFR estimates and the underlying “genuine Virus Prevalence” are
reasonable.
4.1.3. Validation against Slovakia Mass Testing
Test Positivity of 1.06% as recorded in the COVID-19 mass community-testing in Slovakia,
week falls towards the low end of the range of “genuine Virus Prevalence” estimated for that
week. (Figure 4). Positivity for the combined test dataset of rapid tests and PCR tests during
that week (1.48%) is closer to the “genuine Virus Prevalence” best estimate but still on the
low side. This observation is consistent with the concern expressed by some experts [20],
[21] that antigen rapid-tests are less reliable and possibly much less sensitive compared to
PCR tests.
Slovakia was not part of the initial dataset of nine European countries from which this paper
derived the method and correction factors for estimating “genuine Virus Prevalence” from
Test Positivity and Testing Rate. Nevertheless, “genuine Virus Prevalence” for Slovakia is in
the same range as the community spread suggested by mass testing. This observation
suggests that the correction method and correction factors proposed herein may be more
universally deployable, beyond the initial dataset of countries.

4.2. Significance of the trends in “genuine Viral Prevalence”
The “genuine Viral Prevalence” curves for the studied European countries consistently show
a two “waves” pattern (Figure 1) with a 1st epidemic “wave” in week 10 to week 20 and a 2nd
“wave” from about week 34 onward. “Genuine Virus Prevalence” for the 2nd “wave” to date
is approaching similar levels as during the peak of the 1st “wave”. This means that the higher
number of confirmed COVID-19 Cases in the ongoing 2nd “wave” (depending on the country,
2 to 3 times the cases count during the 1st “wave”) is entirely the effect of improved cases
detection due to increased Testing Rate.
“Genuine Virus Prevalence” curves for the 1st epidemic “wave” recorded a “Gompertz style”
flattening and subsequent waning around 0.7% to 2% “depending on the country. Obviously
these values are per-country averages and it is possible that at individual epidemic-outbreak
localities the true virus prevalence might have been considerably higher. Nevertheless, it
appears that epidemic curve flattening and waning happened at relatively modest levels of
COVID-19 infection spread, either naturally or facilitated by the government measures that
restricted social interaction.

5. Conclusions
This paper studied records of PCR Testing Rate and Test Positivity for nine European
countries within the same geographic realm and recording similar trends in virus prevalence,
and developed a method to quantify and remove the biasing effects of different Testing Rate
(over time, or from one country to another) on Test Positivity. Bias-corrected records of Test
Positivity called “genuine Virus Prevalence” are considered a reflection of the degree of
community spread of COVID-19 infections. For the nine European countries, estimates of
“genuine Virus Prevalence” were around 0.5 to 2% during the peak of the 1st COVID-19
epidemic “wave” and are approaching similar levels in the ongoing 2nd epidemic “wave”. It
hence appears that in the 1st epidemic “wave”, curve flattening and waning happened at
relatively modest levels of COVID-19 infection spread, either naturally or facilitated by the
government measures that restricted social interaction.
Results validation by comparison of “genuine Virus Prevalence” against Seroprevalence data
for the studied countries gives a favourable outcome as differences between the two datasets
are relatively small and the observed correlation significant. “Genuine Infection Fatality
Rate” IFR, computed by pairing “genuine Virus Prevalence” with Excess Deaths data, also
shows a reasonable match with closed-community model IFR. Finally, computed estimates of
“genuine Virus Prevalence” for Slovakia give an acceptable match with the results of recent
community mass testing in the country. Based on these validations, the method of computing
“genuine Virus Prevalence” appears robust and may be deployable beyond just the initial
dataset of countries.
