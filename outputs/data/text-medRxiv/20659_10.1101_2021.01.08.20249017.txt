Abstract
Mass testing has been proposed as a strategy to address and contain the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic1,2. We have developed
MassMark, a novel and highly scalable multiplex method that employs next generation
sequencing for high-throughput, accurate and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, while
minimizing handling complexity and resources by utilizing a serial pooling strategy to
accommodate over 9,000 samples per workflow. Analytical validation showed that MassMark
was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA down to a level of 100 copies per reaction. We evaluated
the clinical performance of MassMark in a simulated screening testing with 22 characterized
samples from three different sources (nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs and saliva),
comprising of 12 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with mid to late Ct values (range: 22.98-32.72)
and 10 negative samples. There was one false negative and no false positives, giving an
overall sensitivity and specificity of 91.67% and 100% respectively, when compared against
an optimized RT-PCR test with a target size within 70 bp (CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RTNOTE: This preprint reports new3research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

Introduction
Since the first human cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in
December 2019, the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections have continued to grow at an
exponential rate, with over 79.2 million confirmed cases and over 1.7 million deaths reported
worldwide as of 27 December 20204. Furthermore, due to incomplete surveillance and
imperfect diagnostic accuracy, the confirmed case numbers are likely to be a significant
underestimate of the true number of SARS-CoV-2 infections5–7. While many countries were
able to moderate the spread of the virus via nonpharmaceutical interventions such as
lockdowns and travel restrictions8, the subsequent resurgence of cases in some areas9
demonstrates the necessity of constant and vigilant surveillance to control subsequent waves
of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Though recent breakthroughs around SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development have been highly
encouraging, with efficacy rates of 70-95% observed in Phase 3 clinical trials for three
separate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates10–12, manufacturing and distribution bottlenecks
are likely to pose significant challenges to widespread SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage and
limit its effectiveness in controlling the pandemic13. The number of total COVID-19 deaths
worldwide is projected to be over three million by April 2021, even after taking into account
the effect of vaccine rollouts14. Until effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are made broadly
accessible and widely deployed, mass testing and other mitigation strategies will continue to
play important roles.

Mass testing has been proposed as a strategy to contain and break the cycle of SARS-CoV2 transmission1,2 while minimizing the need for drastic restrictive measures such as lockdowns,
for which extended implementation is impractical due to severe, negative social and economic
impacts15. Population-wide mass surveillance will also allow the detection of asymptomatic
cases, estimated to be approximately 20% of total cases16,17, which form a contagious pool

that contributes to viral transmission18,19 but are difficult to identify with existing symptombased detection protocols.

While SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity has increased considerably worldwide since
the start of the pandemic, there is still a vast and significant gap between actual testing
capacity and benchmark numbers needed to suppress the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus1,20.
Inadequate testing capacity has led to testing backlogs and increased turnaround times21,
hampering efforts to curtail infections22. Other than the gold standard RT-PCR method,
alternative testing modalities will need to be introduced to overcome logistical bottlenecks and
increase testing throughput in order for mass testing to become a feasible reality. Here, we
describe MassMark, a novel method to scale-up SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capacity via
the use of massively parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS).

Like other proposed NGS-based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics23–27, MassMark
utilizes molecular barcodes to identify positive cases by incorporating a unique, predetermined
combination of index sequences to amplify the viral RNA present in a positive sample, while
samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 do not get amplified. The molecular barcode tagging is
achieved in two steps with serial reduction in handling complexity, using only two sets of 96
unique index sequences for over 9000 samples. The use of molecular barcodes allows
thousands of patient samples to be sequenced in parallel in a single NGS run, after which
demultiplexing is performed via the barcode sequences to retrieve the identity of samples that
are positive for SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that MassMark can be used for highly sensitive
and specific detection of extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal
swabs and saliva.

Results
The MassMark method (Fig 1A) consists of two serial rounds of barcoding with uniquely
indexed primers and sample pooling. In the first step, extracted viral RNA is specifically
converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) via reverse transcription (RT) at three target regions
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with three separate barcoding RT primers. Each barcoding RT
primer consists of a region of homology to its specific target region of SARS CoV-2 and a
predetermined 10-bp index sequence corresponding to the sample well position in a 96-well
plate. For each well, the three RT primers carry the same 10-bp index sequence. During the
RT step, individual samples are labelled with a unique sample index (well barcode). A sample
that is negative for SARS-CoV-2 will fail to incorporate the corresponding index sequences.
Products of cDNA synthesis from each 96-well plate are then combined, concentrated and
purified together in a single pool.

Each cDNA pool originating from a single 96-well plate is then subjected to a limited PCR
cycle with a second set of three barcoding primers, each consisting of a region of homology
to its specific target region of SARS CoV-2 and a predetermined 10-bp index sequence
corresponding to the plate identity. The limited PCR converts the products of the first step of
cDNA synthesis to double-stranded DNA products. Importantly, the limited PCR step
additionally labels each individual sample with a second index (plate barcode) common to all
samples originating from the same RT plate. Together with the first sample index (well barcode)
introduced during RT, the addition of the second sample index means that each sample will
be in possession of a unique dual-index combination that allows for subsequent demultiplexing.
Products of limited PCR (up to 96) are combined, concentrated and purified together, resulting
in a single pool of pools that represents SARS-CoV-2 amplicon sequences from up to 96x96
samples.

This double-stranded 96x96 DNA pool then undergoes a final PCR amplification step to
introduce adapters compatible with Illumina sequencing, and, optionally, to attach additional

library indexes to allow multiple 96x96 pools to be multiplexed in the same sequencing run
(Fig 1B). The final amplified library is sequenced, following which sequencing reads
corresponding to each amplicon are identified by their expected SARS-CoV-2 sequence and
are assigned to a starting sample by the identifiable, unique combination of well and plate
barcodes associated with each amplicon that was finally represented in the sequencing library.
An external spike-in control RNA is included in every well as a process control.

Analytical validation
We verified that all three amplicons A, B and C were amplified in positive control samples
comprised of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, diluted to known copy numbers with nuclease-free
water. We observed a linear relationship between sequencing read counts and the amount of
RNA input from approximately 100 to 50,000 copies per reaction, for all three amplicons (Fig
2). To determine the analytical limit of detection for MassMark, we repeated the protocol on
96 contrived samples comprising of 0 copies (n=56), 100 copies (n=20) and 250 copies (n=20)
of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig 3). At 100 input copies of SARS-CoV-2, reads above noise
level (i.e. above read counts for 0-copy samples, in theory expected to be zero) corresponding
to Amplicons A, B and C were detected in 17 (85%), 18 (90%) and 19 (85%) samples
respectively, out of a total of 20 samples. At 250 input copies, reads above noise level
corresponding to Amplicons A, B and C were detected in 20 (100%), 19 (95%) and 20 (100%)
samples respectively, out of a total of 20 samples. Hence, the analytical limit of detection,
defined as the lowest detectable amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA input at which ≥ 95% of all true
positive replicates test positive, was determined to be 100 copies per reaction for Amplicon C,
and 250 copies for both Amplicons A and B. Therefore, the overall analytical limit of detection
of MassMark was 100 copies per reaction.

Clinical validation
To validate the clinical performance of MassMark, we performed the MassMark protocol on
22 clinical samples which had been orthogonally tested for SARS-CoV-2 with an inhouse RT5

PCR Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) utilizing primers and probes from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RTPCR Diagnostic Panel3 with a target size within 70 bp. The 22 clinical samples comprised of
12 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with mid to late cycle threshold (Ct) values (range: 22.9832.72) and 10 SARS-CoV-2 negative samples across three different sample types
nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs and saliva) (Table 1). To evaluate the performance of
MassMark in a larger background of samples, we also included an additional 415 negative notemplate samples. This translates to 12 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (2.7%) out of a total of
437 samples, which would be in line with the approximately 1-4% prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infections observed from a number of surveillance5,7,28 and mass screening29 efforts in places
where the virus is actively spreading. Each plate also includes negative controls (0 copies)
and positive controls from SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the analytical LOD of each of the three
amplicons (100 copies or 250 copies) at fixed well positions per plate (Fig S1). The 22 clinical
samples were distributed randomly across five 96-well plates (Fig S1). Positive/negative calls
were made based on positive and negative controls included on each plate, according to the
interpretation guidelines outlined in Fig S2.

Out of 12 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples tested, we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2
reads above the detection limit in 11 samples via MassMark (Table 1, Fig 4A). There were no
false positives obtained among 10 SARS-CoV-2 negative clinical samples and 415 negative
no-template samples (Table 1, Fig 4A). Read counts obtained for positive clinical samples
were correlated with the Ct values previously determined by RT-PCR (Fig 4B). The single false
negative sample (LDX011) had a late average RT-PCR Ct value of 32.10. Since the RT-PCR
assay gives an average Ct value of 34.15 with 25 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA input (Table
S1), LDX011 would approximately contain less than 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which
is below the limit of detection of MassMark. Overall, for the 22 clinical samples tested, the
concordance of SARS-CoV-2 detection compared to RT-PCR was high, with one false

negative only (Table 2). The sensitivity of MassMark was 91.67% and specificity was 100%
(Table 3).

Discussion
Mass testing has been mooted as the most practical and straightforward way1,2 to curb the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as it allows health authorities to rapidly identify and isolate infectious
individuals, thus limiting the spread of disease and minimizing the need for drastic widespread
lockdown measures, which can have negative socioeconomic consequences15. Even in
places which have successfully controlled the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections,
population-scale mass testing has been proven to be helpful in identifying asymptomatic
cases30,31 that have been missed by symptom-based detection regimes but could still
contribute to silent transmission of the virus18,19.

With its intrinsic properties of being highly scalable and high throughput, NGS lends itself
naturally to mass testing of SARS-CoV-2 as it enables a large amount of data to be generated
in a relatively short amount of time, while allowing a high level of specificity to be maintained
via mapping of exact sequences. Along these lines, a number of different NGS-based
approaches have been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, including LAMP-Seq23,
DxSeq24, REMBRANDT25, HiDRA-seq26 and Swab-Seq27, all of which utilize molecular
barcodes for sample identification. Similarly, MassMark identifies patient samples by labelling
each sample with a unique, predetermined combination of index sequences, which enables
subsequent demultiplexing following sequencing with NGS.

However, unlike other NGS-based approaches, MassMark employs a novel multi-step pooling
approach where samples are combined together in consecutive steps, resulting in a single
library per workflow with up to 9,216 samples represented. Multiple libraries can be further

multiplexed to increase testing capacity per sequencing run. The serial pooling strategy of
MassMark reduces handling complexity and conserves resources after every pooling step,
thus allowing costs to be kept to a minimum, which is an important and desirable feature in
the context of mass screening. Multiplex detection of three specific SARS-CoV-2 amplicons
increases detection sensitivity while preserving a high level of specificity. By including multiple
amplicons, the chances of encountering false negatives due to de novo mutations arising in
primer binding sites are reduced, since the detection of a single amplicon is sufficient to call
the sample positive. In our study, detection sensitivity is improved by integrating information
from all three amplicons, compared to using any single amplicon alone (Table 1).

While RT-PCR tests are typically more sensitive than MassMark, slightly lower sensitivity is
an acceptable trade-off for higher throughput in the context of mass screening and
surveillance32. We show that MassMark is almost as sensitive as RT-PCR for detecting SARSCoV-2 positive clinical samples with mid to late Ct values (up to Ct 33). Compared to existing
methods for SARS-CoV-2 mass screening, MassMark offers a sensitivity that is several orders
of magnitude higher than rapid antigen tests33,34, at the cost of increased minimum assay
turnaround time, though not necessarily overall throughput. The turnaround time for MassMark
can be further improved by sequencing only the molecular barcodes needed for sample
identification, instead of the whole amplicon. In addition, the MassMark workflow can be
further streamlined by investigating its compatibility with direct, extraction-free detection of
SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples, which has been extensively studied and validated with
RT-PCR assays35–37.

In terms of detection specificity, MassMark offers an improvement over existing methods of
RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests. Sequenced reads are mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome,
thus providing further confidence of an accurate call and minimizing the number of false
positives. In our study of over 400 samples, no false positives were observed, indicating a
high level of specificity, although this would have to be further validated when MassMark is

deployed on a larger scale. MassMark also allows genotyping of a limited number of hotspot
regions in SARS-CoV-2, with Amplicon B designed to detect the D614G mutation, a major
variant in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-238. Should the need arise, other SARS-CoV-2
mutation hotspots can be potentially targeted as well by designing alternative amplicons.
Since MassMark is compatible with multiplexing, the method can also be readily extended to
target and differentiate other existing pathogens e.g. influenza viruses in the same assay or
even novel pathogens in future pandemics.

On its own, MassMark is by no means a complete solution for mass testing of SARS-CoV-2
as it requires specialized infrastructure. However, a ready source of NGS capacity is already
available at existing sequencing facilities, which can potentially be repurposed in order for
mass testing, which would require millions of tests per country per week39, to be feasible.
MassMark can be part of a solution for scaling testing capacity at a centralized mass testing
facility, and would have the advantage of being easily compatible with automation as well. A
single benchtop sequencer has sufficient capacity to sequence > 10,000 MassMark samples
in a single run (Table S2); with more sequencers even an average sequencing facility will be
able to perform hundreds of thousands of tests in a single day.

In summary, MassMark offers a unique feature set that is complementary to existing SARSCoV-2 diagnostic methods of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, and would be a viable
alternative option for scaling SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics especially in the context of mass
screening and surveillance, which still have an important role to play in pandemic
management while effective vaccines are being manufactured and made widely available.

Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Processing
Clinical specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs and saliva were collected
as part of a study that was evaluated and approved by the Director of Medical Services,
Ministry of Health, under Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act40. Viral nucleic acid was
extracted from the specimens using Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit II (Geneaid Biotech Ltd.,
Taiwan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted nucleic acid was stored
at -20°C. Samples were processed in a College of American Pathologists (CAP) accredited
and a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) licensed laboratory (Lucence)
and archived extracted RNA from anonymized samples were used.

RT-PCR Laboratory Developed Test
Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is employed to screen
for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using N1 and N2 markers as specified in the CDC 2019nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel3. 7.5 μl of extracted RNA was mixed with 10 μl
Luna Universal One-Step Reaction Mix (2x) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 1 μl
Luna WarmStart RT Enzyme Mix (20x) (New England Biolabs), 1.5 μl N1 primers+probe mix
(Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) or 1.5 μl N2 primers/probe mix (Integrated
DNA Technologies) in a 20 μl reaction. Reactions were carried out in a CFX96 Touch RealTime PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), with reverse transcription at 55°C
for 10 min, then an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95°C
denaturation for 10s and 60°C extension for 30s. Fluorescence intensity is captured at the end
of every extension cycle, and a cycle threshold (Ct) value is calculated using the Bio-Rad CFX
Manager 3.1 software. Limit of detection analysis for the RT-PCR LDT is shown in Table S1.

MassMark Primer Design
Primers were designed against the SARS-CoV-2 Reference Genome (NC_045512.2). We
utilised the Nextstrain41 and GISAID42 databases of SARS-CoV-2 sequences to identify

regions of low mutational entropy and minimize the chances of encountering mutations within
the primer binding sites. Three pairs of primers were designed to capture sequences
corresponding to three different target regions of SARS-CoV-2. Two of these amplicons
(Amplicons A and B) are located within the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, while the remaining
amplicon (Amplicon C) lies in the N gene.

Specificity/Exclusivity Testing: In Silico Analysis
BLASTn analysis queries of the primer pairs used in MassMark were performed against a
public domain nucleotide sequence database (updated on 07/12/2020) consisting of
GenBank+EMBL+DDBJ+PDB+RefSeq sequences, but excluding EST, STS, GSS, WGS,
TSA, patent sequences as well as phase 0, 1, and 2 HTGS sequences and sequences longer
than 100Mb. The search parameters automatically adjust for short input sequences, with
match and mismatch scores set at 1 and -3 respectively, and gap costs for creation and
extension at 5 and 2 respectively.
Amplicon A:
Forward primer showed high sequence homology with Pangolin coronavirus and Bat
coronavirus genomes, while reverse primer showed high sequence homology with Bat
coronavirus genome. Taking into account both primers, there are no significant homologies
with human genome, human pathogens or human microflora that would predict potential false
positive results.
Amplicon B:
Both forward and reverse primers did not show significant homology with other coronaviruses.
Taking into account both primers, there is no prediction of potential false positive results with
human genome, human pathogens or human microflora.
Amplicon C:
Forward primer showed high sequence homology with Bat coronavirus genome, while reverse
primer showed high sequence homology with SARS coronavirus, Pangolin coronavirus and
Bat coronavirus genomes. Taking into account both primers, there are no significant

potential false positive results.
In summary, the MassMark assay, which is designed for the specific detection of SARS-CoV2, showed no significant combined homologies with human genome, human pathogens or
human microflora that would predict potential false positive results.

Reverse Transcription with Indexing (or Barcoding)
Reverse transcription (RT) was performed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 10 μl of extracted RNA was mixed with 2 μl 10X RT Buffer, 0.8 μl 100mM
dNTPs, 1 μl Multiscribe Reverse Transcriptase, 1 μl RNase inhibitor, 2 μl 1μM barcoding (well)
RT primers (Integrated DNA Technologies), 1 μl 4.15fM spike-in control (Integrated DNA
Technologies) and nuclease-free water in a 20 μl reaction. Each reaction consists of a set of
three barcoding RT primers, with one RT primer for each of the three target amplicons
(Amplicons A, B, C). Reactions were carried out in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad)
at 25°C for 10 min, followed by 37°C for 120 min and finally 85°C for 5 min. First strand cDNA
products were immediately used in the subsequent steps or stored at -20°C.

Internal and External Reaction Controls
The spike-in control, a synthetic RNA with primer binding sites for reverse transcription and
PCR primers corresponding to Amplicon A, was included in every reverse transcription
reaction at 2,500 copies per well as an internal positive control. Other than the primer binding
sites, the spike-in control contains a pseudo sequence which allows it to be distinguished from
Amplicon A reads originating from actual SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.

Four external positive and four external negative controls were also included on every plate in
fixed positions. The four external positive controls comprised of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(Twist Bioscience, San Francisco, CA, USA) at 10,000, 1,000, 250 and 100 copies per well.

The negative, no template controls comprised of nuclease-free water instead of extracted
sample RNA.

PCR for Amplicon Generation with Indexing (or Barcoding)
A maximum of 96 first strand cDNA samples per plate were pooled together and concentrated
in an Amicon Ultra-2 Centrifugal Filter (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), followed by a round of
purification with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). A limited, single-cycle
amplification of the pooled cDNA products using a single barcoding primer for each of the
three amplicons was performed to generate double-stranded cDNA products. Briefly, 25 μl of
purified first strand cDNA was mixed with 5 μl 5X SuperFi II Buffer, 1 μl 10mM dNTPs, 1 μl
Platinum SuperFi II DNA (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), 1 μl 5μM barcoding (plate) forward
primers (Integrated DNA Technologies) and nuclease-free water in a 50 μl reaction. Reactions
were carried out in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler at 98°C for 90 s, 60°C for 6 min and finally
72°C for 6 min. Double-stranded cDNA products were immediately used in the subsequent
steps or stored at -20°C.

Product Amplification
A maximum of 96 double-stranded cDNA samples were pooled together and concentrated in
an Amicon Ultra-2 Centrifugal Filter (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The concentrated product
was subjected to treatment with 50 units of Thermolabile Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs)
in 1x NEBuffer 3.1 in a 50 μl reaction at 37°C for 10 min and then 80°C for 1 min, followed by
a round of purification with AMPure XP beads. To amplify products and add appropriate
adaptors for compatibility with Illumina sequencing, PCR was performed with KAPA HiFi
HotStart ReadyMix according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 23 μl of purified

15 s), annealing (60°C, 30 s) and extension (72°C, 30 s). This was then finished with a final
extension step at 72°C for 1 minute. The amplified libraries underwent two rounds of
purification with AMPure XP beads. The final purified libraries were visualized with a High
Sensitivity D1000 Screentape (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on a 4200 Tapestation (Agilent).
Libraries were quantified using a KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
on a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System, before sequencing on a MiniSeq
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) or NextSeq 550 (Illumina) depending on the sample load
(Table S2). 35,000 reads are allocated per individual sample.

Indexes
Well and plate indexes are all 10-bp long and are predetermined to have a minimum edit
distance of 3 from every other index. To achieve multiplexing of 9,216 samples, 96 well
indexes and 96 plate indexes are required.

Sequence Deconvolution and Sample Identification
Demultiplexed FASTQ files were analyzed for expected well and plate indexes that occur at
the beginning and end of reads and correspond to single specimens. Reads were matched to
targeted SARS-CoV-2 genome and enumerated for each well and plate index combination
available in the predefined index library. Reads were also matched to the spike-in control
sequence with same index combinations and enumerated. Specimens were positive for
SARS-CoV-2 if they were represented by well and plate index combinations, among the
sequencing reads. No corresponding well and plate index combination is expected for
specimens with no SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1: (A) Overview of MassMark workflow. 1) Extracted RNA undergoes reverse transcription to generate cDNA tagged with a barcode corresponding to the sample well
position in the plate, following which up to 96 samples are pooled per plate. Only one of up to 96 plates for one workflow is represented in the figure. The configuration of sample
barcodes is the same on each plate. 2) Single-stranded cDNA undergoes a limited, 1-cycle PCR to generate double-stranded cDNA. A second barcode representing the plate
identity is added in this PCR. Samples from up to 96 plates are then pooled together. 3) The double-stranded cDNA pool undergoes PCR amplification, during which Illumina
sequencing adapters and library indexes are attached. 4) The final library representing up to 9,216 samples is sequenced, and samples are demultiplexed according to their unique
combination of well and plate barcodes. Multiple libraries can be sequenced in the same run and demultiplexed according to their library indexes. (B) Structure of final dually
barcoded product to be sequenced.

Figure 2: Read counts are correlated to input copy numbers of samples of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA converted to
sequencing library using the MassMark method. Median read counts are plotted (n=3). Error bars denote interquartile
range. A linear relationship is observed between 100 and 50,000 copies input for amplicons A, B and C.

Figure 3: Analytical limit of detection (LOD) for three amplicons A, B and C in MassMark. Samples were run with 0 copies (n=56), 100 copies (n=20) and 250
copies (n=20) of input synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Solid horizontal lines represent mean read counts. Dotted lines separate read counts obtained for replicates
of 0 copies and replicates of copy number representing the LOD of MassMark assay for each of the three amplicons. The LOD differs for each amplicon and is
set to 100 copies per reaction for the overall assay.

Raw read counts
were normalized to internal plate positive controls. (B) Normalized sequencing read counts (MassMark) vs Ct values (RT-PCR) for 12 positive clinical samples.
In general, lower read counts are obtained for samples with higher Ct values.
