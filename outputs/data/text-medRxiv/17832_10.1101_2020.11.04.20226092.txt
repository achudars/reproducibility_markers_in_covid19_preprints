ABSTRACT
Data from non-traditional data sources, such as social media, search engines, and remote sensing,
have previously demonstrated utility for disease surveillance. Few studies, however, have
focused on countries in Africa, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, we
use searches of COVID-19 symptoms, questions, and at-home remedies submitted to Google to
model COVID-19 in South Africa, and assess how well the Google search data forecast shortterm COVID-19 trends. Our findings suggest that information seeking trends on COVID-19
could guide models for anticipating COVID-19 trends and coordinating appropriate response
measures.

INTRODUCTION (1473 words)
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has infected millions of people globally, and continues to spread
rapidly in many countries. During the initial COVID-19 outbreaks in March 2020, countries in
Africa were able to contain large waves of infections with the early implementation of
containment measures; however, as lockdowns and restrictions have eased and testing has
expanded, cases in Africa have steadily increased even with the scale up of national and
provincial responses.1 As of August 2020, more than half of Africa‚Äôs cases were recorded in
South Africa, despite only comprising 5% of the continent‚Äôs total population - largely due to
South Africa‚Äôs rapid expansion of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing capacity for SARSCoV-2 diagnosis.2,3 After the first wave, which occurred in the South African winter,
seroprevalence survey estimates that between 29%-40% have been infected, varying strongly by
geography.4,5 Moreover, as of October 2020, cases have been steadily increasing in South
Africa.6,7 A number of factors facilitate increased COVID-19 transmission in Africa, including
weak health care systems,8 high prevalence of other diseases such as HIV and TB,9-12 and the
inability to adhere to physical distancing and other intervention strategies.13
Although the current reported mortality burden is lower than had been projected by public health
experts, the pandemic has highlighted gaps in surveillance systems.14-16 Surveillance systems
could incorporate non-traditional sources of information that can provide insights into local
spread of disease. Data from non-traditional data sources, such as social media, search engines,
and remote sensing have demonstrated usefulness for disease surveillance. While there are
indications that these data could be useful for supplementing traditional surveillance systems,
few studies have focused on countries in Africa.17,18 Specifically, searches of disease-related
terms (such as, COVID-19) could reveal trends in cases. A recent report estimated that 56.2% of

the South African population had access to the internet in 2017.19 Data submitted on search
engines could assist in monitoring COVID-19 trends and response to interventions, which would
assist in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa, and to trigger rapid resource
allocation.
In this paper, we used searches of COVID-19 symptoms, questions, and at-home remedies
submitted to Google to model expected current and future COVID-19 cases in South Africa. We
assessed how well the search data forecasted near future COVID-19 trends, information vital for
the coordination of rapid response measures.

METHODS
COVID-19 Case Data
We collected data on reported COVID-19 cases and number of tests administered from the South
African National Institute of Communicable Diseases from April 19th 2020 to August 29th,
2020.20 The National Department of Health defined a COVID-19 case as laboratory confirmation
of COVID-19 disease based on PCR tests. Confirmed COVID-19 case counts and tests were
reported from all nine provinces in South Africa on a daily basis. Since variability in testing
during the pandemic can affect the number of cases detected, the main outcome of the study was
weekly test positivity rate, which is the number of positive cases divided by the number of
individuals tested. This metric has previously been used to gauge the current severity of the
epidemic.21

Google Search Data
We made a list of forty-three Google Search terms crowdsourced from infectious disease
modelers and data scientists in South Africa (Table 1). The term list included questions about
COVID-19, symptoms, and at-home remedies used in South Africa. We downloaded weekly
search volume from the Google API for each of the phrases in the list for all provinces (i.e.,
Gauteng, Eastern Cape, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West,
Northern Cape, and Western Cape). The search volume for each of the terms relative to the
search activity in the region is normalized by Google.

Statistical Analysis
We first calculated the association between the search terms and COVID-19 case data using
Pearson correlation to assess how well searches related to the test positivity rate. Next, we fit
several multivariable regression models using Elastic Net, a regularization and variable selection

method, previously used and validated for modeling influenza-like illness (ILI) trends.22-24 We
selected the Elastic Net modeling approach because it has many advantages, including good
performance when the number of observations are small and the number of covariates are
large.22,25 The multivariable regression model is defined as, ùë¶(ùë°) = ‚àëùëõùëó=1 ùõΩùëó (ùë°)ùë•ùëó (ùë°) + ùúÄ, where
x represents search terms for each of the provinces, y is the case positivity rate, ùõΩ are the model
estimated coefficients and ùë° is time. To determine the best model for each province, we varied

the value of ùõº in the estimator given by min 2 ‚àëùëõùëó=1(ùë¶ùëó ‚àí ‚àëùëõùëó=1 ùë•ùëóùëñ ùõΩùëñ )2 + ùúÜ ‚àëùëùùëñ=1[ 2 (1 ‚àí
ùõΩ

ùõº)ùõΩùëñ2

+ ùõº | ùõΩùëñ |]. When ùõº equals zero, the estimator equates to Ridge regression and Least

Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) when ùõº is one. We fitted separate models
for each province and used the adjusted coefficient of determination and Root Mean Squared
Error (RMSE) to assess model fit and forecast, as well as Pearson correlation to quantify their
associations.

RESULTS
Associations between searches and COVID-19 cases
The two search terms with the most significant correlation with COVID-19 case positivity rate
for each of the nine provinces were as follows (Figure 1): Western Cape (COVID symptoms
[r=0.878] and shortness of breath [0.729]), Eastern Cape (eucalyptus oil [0.926] and COVID
symptoms [0.858]), Northern Cape (eucalyptus oil [0.665] and shortness of breath [0.588]), Free
State (zinc [0.782] and COVID symptoms [0.890]), KwaZulu Natal (loss of smell [0.919] and
COVID symptoms [0.882]), North West (COVID symptoms [0.794] and symptoms of COVID19 [0.768]), Gauteng (loss of smell [0.899] and loss of taste [0.885]), Mpumalanga (COVID
symptoms [0.762] and eucalyptus oil [0.653]), and Limpopo (loss of smell [0.719] and runny
nose [0.673]). The search terms COVID symptoms, shortness of breath, eucalyptus oil, zinc, and
loss of smell were repeated for multiple provinces.

Figure 1: Correlation between search terms and COVID-19 case positivity rate. The correlations
were significantly higher for some provinces (such as, Gauteng and Eastern Cape) compared to
others especially for at-home remedies (e.g., Eucalyptus oil) and symptoms (e.g., loss of smell).

Nowcasting and Forecasting COVID-19 cases
Elastic Net with ùõº equal to one (i.e., LASSO regression) had the best model fit. The correlation
between the model estimates and proportion of positive cases were 0.854, 0.935, 0.949, 0.912,
0.962, 0.871, 0.776, 0.798 and 0.992 for Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, North West,
KwaZulu Natal, Free State, Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape, respectively
(Figure 2, SI Figure 1). The corresponding root mean squared errors (RMSE) were 0.048, 0.045,
0.038, 0.056, 0.034, 0.068, 0.073, 0.044 and 0.015. Moreover, there was a significant drop and
increase in reported Google searches during the first week and last weeks of August,
respectively, which impacted estimates for several provinces. When search trends from the
previous week were used to forecast cases for the next week, the models estimates of COVID-19
cases improved moderately (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Our work demonstrates that a number of Google Search terms were strongly correlated with test
positivity rate, and this varied by province. Furthermore, our province-level models predicted
COVID-19 test positivity with good model fit. This demonstrates the importance of
geographically specific models for using Google search term data to predict future cases. The
nowcast models suggest that people were already seeking information on remedies prior to
getting tested in some provinces, such as KwaZulu Natal, since our results show that Google
term searches peaked a week earlier than SARS-CoV-2 cases. This is consistent with the delay in
onset of symptoms, seeking a test, and getting a test result. As such, our forecast models
demonstrate that search data could be used to forecast short term trends in COVID-19 cases, as
individuals likely seek information about symptoms and remedies prior to getting tested, during

the first few days of symptom onset. Our findings suggest that information seeking trends on
COVID-19 could guide models for anticipating COVID-19 trends, informing decision making
and rapid resource allocation in South Africa. The use of these provincial-level google search
terms can also be an early warning system that could trigger additional mitigation measures
ahead of a rise in cases.
This study is important for several reasons. First, there is a paucity of studies demonstrating the
usability of data from Internet sources for disease surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. Second,
we note that in addition to symptoms, at-home remedies used in managing COVID-19 symptoms
were significant in estimating current and future COVID-19 case trends. This reinforces the need
for developing contextualized approaches that take into account cultural and social practices.18
Lastly, geographical variability in our estimates suggest that factors as Internet usage,
representation and socioeconomic factors should be considered when using digital data for
disease surveillance.
There are some limitations to our study. The study period is short, therefore limiting the
available data. However, even with the data limitations, we were able to create models with good
fit; thus, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, we would expect that additional data points
would only improve model estimates. Due to the small sample size, confidence intervals (CI)
were unreliable. However, CI can be estimated by adding an additional modeling step such as, a
generalized linear model (see SI Figure 1 and 2). Second, there might be variability in the athome remedies that were used in different provinces, and were not captured in our data. We
aimed to include an inclusive and comprehensive list of appropriate search terms, and the input
by several infectious disease scientists familiar with the South African context provided insight
on province-specific cultural and social practices. The inclusion of any further provincialspecific at-home remedies in our search terms would only further improve the model fit. Third, if
there are large changes to testing strategies used over time, that may affect the use of these
models to forecast case-positivity. Should changes to the testing strategy occur, such as
widespread use of rapid antigen diagnostics, or community testing, different outcome metrics
may become more reliable for forecasting.
Despite these limitations, we demonstrate that there is value in using non-traditional data sources
for disease surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. As more people use the Internet for seeking and
sharing health information, there will be more opportunities for developing digital surveillance
tools that could supplement traditional surveillance systems. Given that COVID-19 cases in the
African continent are increasing again, novel disease surveillance tools are invaluable for the
coordination of rapid response measures.
