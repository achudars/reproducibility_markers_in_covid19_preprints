Abstract

21

Background: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was characterized by rapidly increasing patient

22

volumes, which necessitated a swift emergency department (ED) overhaul. Challenges mainly

23

concerned surge capacity, frontline staff protection and the segregation of patients with suspected

24

COVID-19. To date, only few studies have assessed nation-wide ED preparedness for the COVID-19

25

pandemic. This study aimed to form an overview of preparations that were taken in Dutch EDs during

26

the initial phase of this public health crisis.

27

Methods: This study was designed as a nation-wide, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study

28

among Dutch hospital organizations with ≥1 ED. The questionnaire was conducted between the first

29

and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and contained close-ended and

30

open-ended questions on changes in ED infrastructure, ED workforce adaptions and the role of

31

emergency physicians (EPs) in the hospital’s crisis organization.

32

Results: Overall response rate was 79.5%. All EDs had made preparations in anticipation of a possible

33

COVID-19 surge. Treatment capacity was expanded in 69.7% of EDs, with a median increase of 49%

34

(IQR 32.5–72.7%). COVID-19 suspected patients were segregated from non-COVID-19 patients in

35

86.4% of EDs. Non-COVID-19 patients were more often assessed at alternative locations than

36

patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. In 81.8% of EDs the workforce was expanded, which

37

mainly concerned expansion of nursing staff. A formal role of EPs in the hospital’s crisis organization

38

was reported by 93.9% of EP staffed hospital organizations.

39

Conclusion: All Dutch EDs made preparations for COVID-19 in a short time span and with many

40

uncertainties. Preparations predominantly concerned expansion of treatment capacity and

41

segregation of COVID-19 ED care. EPs had a prominent role, both in direct patient COVID-19 ED care

42

and in the hospitals’ crisis organizations. Although it is vital for EDs to be able to dynamically adapt to

43

community needs, variability of pandemic ED preparedness was high.

Introduction

52

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in Southeast China in December 2019 and was

53

declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.1 As COVID-19 spread

54

rapidly around the globe, emergency departments (EDs) within hospitals braced for impact. In the

55

Netherlands, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on February 27, 2020.2 As of February 27,

56

2021, there have been 1,084,021 confirmed cases of infection (of which 24,165 were hospitalized)

57

and 15,543 confirmed COVID-19-deaths.3

58

Emergency medical services and the EDs within hospitals are viewed as the community-based

59

resources responsible for the initial medical response towards any type of disaster, both in the short

60

and long term.4 In contrast with sudden-onset events, large-scale infectious outbreaks typically

61

require a prolonged, sustainable response.4,5 Since its commencement, the current COVID-19

62

pandemic was characterized by rapidly increasing patient volumes, which necessitated a swift

63

overhaul of several aspects of ED preparations in Dutch hospitals.6,7 Challenges mainly concerned

64

surge capacity, frontline staff protection and the segregation of patients with suspected COVID-19.8-

65

11

66

To date, only few studies have assessed nation-wide ED preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. A

67

French questionnaire-based study, conducted during an early stage of the pandemic (March 7 to

68

March 11, 2020), revealed that EDs were poorly prepared.12

69

A similar study from India, limited to academic EDs, showed that 90% of hospitals had developed

70

specific COVID-19 triage systems and that almost 80% established dedicated areas for COVID-19

71

suspected patients. However, it also revealed that the level of preparedness amongst EDs was highly

72

variable. The authors stated that an individualized strategy for ED preparedness that considers

73

baseline needs and available resources is superior to a blanket strategy for all EDs.13

74

Whilst clinical and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity for COVID-19 in Dutch hospitals were closely

75

monitored and controlled through a national body, there was no guidance on the surge capacity

76

management of EDs.6 Consequently, hospitals largely restructured the organization of their EDs on a

77

solitary basis. This study aimed to form an overview of preparations that were taken in Dutch EDs

78

during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it aimed to explore the role of Dutch

79

emergency physicians (EPs) in the hospitals’ crisis organizations.

80

Methods

81

Setting

82

The Netherlands is provided with a modern healthcare system with effective primary care and a

83

finely meshed network of specialized acute and critical care facilities, including 83 EDs (Fig 1). The

84

EDs are located within 71 hospital organizations (11 hospital organizations have multiple ED

85

locations). These EDs serve a population of 17.4 million people and have a mean annual attendance

86

rate of 22,500 patients, of which on average 17.4% are self-referred.14

Study design

91

This was designed as a nation-wide, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study among Dutch hospital

92

organizations with ≥1 ED. For each hospital organization one respondent, consisting of either an EP

93

or an ED manager, received an invitation by email on July 29, 2020. If a respondent did not complete

the questionnaire, a reminder was sent every fortnight. The questionnaire could be completed until

95

September 30, 2020. English and Dutch versions of the questionnaire are provided as supplemental

96

file 1 and 2.

97

Respondents were requested to complete the questionnaire on behalf of the hospital organization

98

where the respondent practiced. When the hospital organization contained multiple EDs, the

99

questionnaire adapted to facilitate information on all EDs. The questionnaire contained 14 close-

100

ended multiple-choice questions and 2 open-ended questions on general ED details and on

101

preparations for a possible surge in COVID-19 patients. Broadly, these questions covered 3 topics:

102

changes in ED infrastructure, ED workforce adaptions and the role of EPs in the hospital’s crisis

103

organization.

104

Statistical analysis

105

All analyses were performed with SPSS version 26 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Continuous data were

106

reported as means with standard deviation (SD) or as medians with interquartile ranges (IQR).

107

Categorical data were reported as absolute numbers and as valid percentages (to correct for missing

108

data).

109

All data were collected anonymously. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in

110

Epidemiology guidelines was used for reporting this observational study.16 The Medical Ethics

111

Committee Zuyderland & Zuyd concluded that the rules of the Medical Research Involving Human

112

Subjects Act (WMO in Dutch) do not apply to this study (METCZ20200130). The study was registered

113

in the Netherlands Trial Register (Trial number NL8818).

114

Results

115

The questionnaire was completed on behalf of 66 (79.5%) out of 83 EDs (Table 1). These EDs served

116

58 (81.7%) out of 71 hospital organizations, as eight hospital organizations had multiple ED locations.

117

Pre-COVID, the majority of the EDs had an annual attendance rate of fewer than 30.000 patients per

118

year and 86.4% of EDs were staffed by EPs.

119

All participating EDs had made preparations in anticipation of a possible surge of COVID-19 patients.

120

The date when these preparations were finalized varied between February 24 and May 5, 2020.

Changes in ED infrastructure

124

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the median number of ED treatment spaces was 17 (IQR 12–21)

125

(Table 2). Treatment capacity was expanded in 46 (69.7%) EDs. The median number of additional

126

treatment spaces was 8 (IQR 4-10), which equals to a median increase of 49% (IQR 32.5–72.7%).

127

Explanations for not increasing the ED capacity included previous reduction of ED utilization by

128

several logistic alterations (15.2%), being designated as a non-COVID-19 ED (6.1%), and the inability

129

to expand ED treatment spaces due to isolation measures demanding more space per patient (4.5%).

130

Logistic alterations to usual practice included the redirection of low-acuity ED visits, such as minor

131

traumatic injuries, to outpatient departments in 41 (62.1%) EDs. Furthermore, 12 (18.1%) EDs

132

effectuated a faster admission process to hospital wards and intensive care units, therewith

133

shortening ED length of stay.

134

COVID-19 suspected patients were segregated from non-COVID-19 patients in 57 (86.4%) EDs. In the

135

majority (68.4%) of EDs, this was organized within the original ED space. The alternative locations

136

used by the remaining EDs can be found in supplemental file 3. In most (75.4%) EDs, the suspicion of

137

COVID-19 was established using a symptom-based checklist only.

138

In 53 (80.3%) hospital organizations, one or more of the implemented measures for the pandemic

139

were intended to be maintained (Supplemental file 4). These included improved infection prevention

140

in 13 (22.4%), improved interdisciplinary collaboration in 13 (22.4%), permanent adjustments to

141

ED workforce adaptations

146

In 54 (81.8%) EDs the workforce was expanded (Table 3). In all of these EDs nursing staff was

147

expanded by deploying both additional specialized ED nurses (53.0%) as well as nurses from other

148

departments (60.6%). A large variety of physicians were directly involved in COVID-19 ED care, of

149

which emergency medicine (86.4%), internal medicine (84.8%) and pulmonology (81.8%) were

role of EPs in the hospital’s crisis organization was reported in 46 (93.9%) hospital organizations. An

organizations.

166

Discussion

167

This questionnaire-based study aimed to provide an overview of preparations of Dutch EDs for the

168

initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. With a response rate of 79.5% of EDs, the results are

169

representative for all Dutch EDs.

170

All participating EDs made preparations for a surge in COVID-19 patients. Treatment capacity was

171

expanded in almost 70% of the participating EDs, with a median increase in treatment spaces of 50%.

172

COVID-19 patients were segregated from non-COVID-19 patients in 86.4% of EDs, and ED workforce

173

was expanded in 81.8% of EDs. EPs were directly involved in the care for COVID-19 patients in all EDs

174

and had a prominent role in the crisis organization in 93.9%.

175

The COVID-19 pandemic forced EDs to make drastic organizational changes in a very short time span.

176

At the time, it was unclear for EDs if they would be either sufficient or even necessary.8 In the

177

Netherlands, there was national guidance on clinical and ICU capacity.6 Remarkably, there was no

178

alignment or general advice on the expansion of ED capacity. This is reflected by the heterogeneity of

179

the results of this study. Although more alignment between EDs may be desirable, the solitary surge

180

capacity plans worked for most EDs as the majority reported no or occasional crowding. In this

181

perspective, it is important to acknowledge that ED surge capacity planning should be

182

accommodated to specific hospital characteristics and leave room for improvisation, even when

10

183

there is national guidance. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, regions within the

184

Netherlands differed considerably with regards to COVID-19 infection rates. This may have

185

influenced the burden on EDs and could in part explain the heterogeneity between pandemic ED

186

approaches as well.

187

The COVID-19 pandemic may have changed ED care forever, as some adaptions will remain. E-health

188

applications have flourished and there is more focus on getting the right care in the right place.17

189

Some patient categories do not necessarily need ED care, but may receive safe and efficient care at

190

another location. Furthermore, this public health crisis has shown the importance of a strong

191

emergency and critical care system, where a certain degree of overcapacity may be pivotal for an

192

effective response. As this pandemic is ongoing, surge capacity models that allow flexibility to some

193

extent may be most useful.7,9,18 Hospital capacity is dynamic and highly dependent on the occupancy

194

of available resources.19 At times when the pressure on ED care is temporarily lower, capacity could

195

be used for non-urgent care and vice versa. This way, hospitals could timely anticipate to community

196

demands.

197

Close collaboration within hospitals has always been of vital importance. As shown by our results,

198

virtually all medical disciplines were deployed in the EDs during the pandemic. Although this survey

199

did not examine the quality of inter-disciplinary collaboration, multiple respondents greatly valued

200

the unique situation where all kinds of disciplines worked closely together. It may not come as a

201

surprise that EPs, internists and pulmonologists were involved in COVID-19 ED care. However, EPs

202

also played an important role in ED coordination and triage. Furthermore, EPs took vital positions in

203

the hospitals’ crisis organizations, underling the necessity of experienced staff members working

204

specifically in the ED.

205

The present study is not without limitations. First, this was a retrospective questionnaire-based study

206

filled in by one respondent per ED, who may also have been the most involved professionals in crisis

207

management in these EDs. Second, hospitals all around the world experienced reduced utilization of

208

emergency services during the pandemic.20 This phenomenon, which is not yet completely

209

understood, may have salvaged EDs which could have suffered from overcrowding without the

210

reduction of non-COVID-19 ED care. In other words, the pandemic approaches of these EDs may not

211

be as successful in other crisis situations. Finally, the results of this study may not apply to EDs in

212

other healthcare systems, specifically systems without a strong primary care system functioning as

213

gatekeepers for the hospitals.

214

Conclusion

215

This study showed that all Dutch EDs made preparations for COVID-19 in a short time span and with

216

many uncertainties. Preparations primarily included the expansion of treatment capacity and the

217

segregation of COVID-19 care. EPs had a prominent role, both in direct patient COVID-19 ED care and

218

in the crisis organizations of hospitals. Although it is vital for EDs to be able to dynamically adapt to

219

community needs, variability of pandemic ED preparedness was high.
