Abstract
Introduction
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which
caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social,
political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always
work in a high-risk environment. Currently, there is no vaccine or drug for the disease.
Therefore, strictly practicing precautionary measures are the only option to save the life. Some
studies reported health professional’s practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19.
Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those
research gaps in the study setting.

Methods
In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals were involved from the public health
facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method was
employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool
and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15 and a binary logistic
regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association
was declared at P< 0.05.

Results
In this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals’ had a good practice on
precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands
continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during
sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common
practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR=1.84, 95%CI:
1.06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR=2.02, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.18),
and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19 were factors showed
signification association with the practice.

Conclusions
The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic
among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the
knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to
boost the practice and to advance service delivery.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by a novel
coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2). The case
was first identified in Wuhan province, China, and spread to other parts of the world within a
short period. The disease is highly infectious, and clinical symptoms include fever, dry cough,
fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea [1-5]. The three modes of transmissions are droplets (when an
infected person coughs or sneezes), contact (subject touches a surface or object contaminated
with the virus and subsequently touch their mouth, nose, or eyes), and aerosol (respiratory
droplets)[6, 7]. However, a few studies indicated the digestive system as a potential
transmission route for COVID-19 infection[8]. The nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 detects in the
real-time fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [7, 9, 10].
Currently, there are no drugs or vaccines approved to prevent or treat COVID-19. The best
prevention is avoiding exposure to the virus [11-19]. Health care professionals (HCPs) are at
the front line of the COVID-19 outbreak response. Preventing intra-hospital transmission of
contagious disease is, therefore, a priority [20, 21]. Because of their direct contact with
patients, health workers play critical roles in the prevention of the COVID-19 outbreak. A
combination of standards, airborne and droplet precautions should practice for all COVID-19
cases. They must use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a glove, gown or apron,
and surgical mask [16, 22, 23].
World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a public health
emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and as a global pandemic [24-26]. Several
thousand healthcare workers have already infected with COVID-19, and there is a report of
deaths in China, Italy, Spain, Pakistan, the UK, and other countries [21, 27-31]. According to
the Chinese Red Cross Foundation, the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s
Republic of China, and public media, a total of 23 of the health care professionals among these
3387 persons had died from COVID-19 after they became infected during the practice of
medicine in Wuhan and elsewhere in China [28].
The contained outbreak could significantly influence the global economy in the short run. The
scale of costs might be reduced by investment in public health systems in all economies but
particularly in less developed economies where health care systems are less developed, and
population density is high [32]. The public health systems in Africa are coming under severe
strain as the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic persists [33, 34].
Hospital associated transmission is suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for
affected health professionals (29%) and hospitalized patients (12.3%)[35]. A study conducted
in Washington State reported that due to ineffective precautionary measures, 81 of the
residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors infected and died with COVID-19[36]. Therefore,
universal source control, early identification, and isolation of patients with suspected disease,
the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with
COVID-19, and environmental disinfection are obligatory in the health care settings[37].
The practice of precautionary measures for coronavirus (CoVs) among HCPs was 89.7% in a
study conducted in China[38], 87.9% in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [39], and 70.12% Iran
[40]. To control the COVID-19 pandemic, 96.10% of HCPs had washing hands with soap or

cleaning with sanitizers, and 84.30% had avoided to touching of eyes, nose, or mouth in the
study from Pakistan [41], and 24.2% used facemask in the crowds in the study from Saudi
Arabia [42]. Another study from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia showed PPE used when seeing
suspected cases CoV infection was mainly the mask (94.1%), gloves (78.8%), the gown
(60%), goggles (31.8%), and the cap (22.4%) [43]. Different works of the literature indicated
that age, gender, knowledge level, attitude, work experience and job category, working hours,
educational attainment were factors associated with HCWs’ practice of precautionary measures
towards COVID-19 [38-40].
During this time, many studies are emerging by scholars regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nevertheless, health care professionals' practice of precautionary measures towards the
COVID-19 takes the lion share and vital to save the life of professionals and others. Presently,
a few studies assessed practice and factors affecting precautionary measures for the COVID19 pandemic among health professionals. Besides, there are limited studies in country
Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the health professional's practice and associated
factors towards precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic in public health facilities
of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia.

Methods
Study setting, and period
In this study, health professionals working in public health facilities of the Gamo zone,
southern Ethiopia, were involved, from June 10-19, 2020. Gamo zone is one of the
administrative zones in Ethiopia. It bordered with Wolayta, Dawro, and Gofa zones in the
North, on the northeast by the Lake Abaya and the southeast by the Amaro special woreda,
and Dirashe special woreda, and on the southwest by South Omo. The administrative center of
the Gamo zone is Arba Minch town. Arba Minch town, located 505 km southwest from Addis
Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, and 275 km southwest of Hawassa, the capital city of
southern Ethiopia. Gamo zone has one administrative town and 13 woredas. It hosted five
hospitals (one general and four primary hospitals), 56 health centers, and 299 health posts,
which serve the community by providing preventive and curative services. There are 2570
(1096 male and 1474 female) health professionals who are working in those institutions [44].
Study design
The institution-based cross-section study design was employed to meet study objectives.
Population
Source population
The source population for this study was all health professionals who work in public health
facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia.
Study population
The study population for this study was all health professionals who were working in selected
health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia, during the study period.

Eligibility criteria
All health professionals who were staff and working at least for six months in selected health
facilities recruited in this study, whereas those health professionals who were sick and on
annual leave at the time of data collection were not involved in this study.
Sample size determination
Epi info 7 StatCalc software used to estimate the sample sizes. For the first specific objective,
a single population proportion was used by considering the following assumption: P=0.897
from the study conducted in China [38], 95% level of confidence, and 3% margin of error.
Therefore, based on this assumption, the calculated sample size was 394. To determine the
sample size for the second objective two-sample comparison proportion was used by
considering the following assumptions: work experience of less than one year (P1) =82.7%,
and >5 years (P2) =95.7% from the study in Pakistan[41], 95% level of confidence, Power of
90%, and Ratio:1:1. Based on this assumption, the estimated sample size was 266. As such,
the final sample size came up by adding a non-response rate of 10% to the larger sample size,
which was 394 that estimated by the first objective. Therefore, the calculated sample size for
this study was 434.
Sampling procedure
Currently, there are five fully functional hospitals and fifty-six health centers in the Gamo
zone. A simple random sampling method was employed to select three hospitals and fifteen
health centers from them (Figure 1). Then, the calculated sample size, proportionally allocated
to those health facilities based on the number of health professionals who were working.
Finally, a simple random sampling method after generating a table of random numbers used to
select health professionals based on proportions allocated to each health facility (Table 1).

Data collection method
Interviewer-administered Open Data Kit (ODK) survey tool and observational checklist were
employed to collect the data. The survey tool and observational checklist were adapted by
reviewing different works of literature, WHO, and national guidelines related to COVID-19
precautionary measures [41, 45-47]. Eight data collectors and three supervisors were involved.
Before starting data collection, both the data collectors and supervisors trained on data
collection ways and overall procedure and ODK survey tool by experts for one day. The data
collectors gave information about the study's aim before interviewing the study participants.
Then those participants who were willing and signed in the voluntary consent interviewed.
Study variables
The dependent variable for this study was the health care professionals’ practice of
precautionary measures for COVID-19. Socio-demographic and professional-related
characteristics (age, sex, education level, job category, working hours, and work experience,
knowledge about COVID-19, and attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19
were the independent variables for this study.

Data quality control
The tools that were validated by scholars were employed to collect the information, and it was
pre-tested in setting with similar characteristics. Extensive training gave for both data
collectors and supervisors to maintain consistency and to standardize the data collection
techniques. The training focused on the objectives of the study, data collection tool, data
collection methods, ways of checking the completeness of data, ways of maintaining the
confidentiality of the data.
Data management and processing
The survey template uploaded to the ODK cloud server (ODK Aggregate platform of AMU),
then the survey template was download to individual data collector's smartphone for data
collection. After completing the data of each study participant, the data collectors sent the data
to the ODK cloud server after confirmed by supervisors. After cessation of the data collection,
the data were downloaded from ODK aggregate and then exported to Stata version 15 for
analysis.
Data analysis
The univariate analysis such as; proportions, frequency, and summary statistics computed. The
bivariate analysis used to see the association between each independent variable and the
outcome variable by using binary logistic regression. The assumptions for binary logistic
regression checked, and the goodness of fit-tested by the log-likelihood ratio (LR). All

possible confounders. A Multi-collinearity test ran to see the correlation between independent
variables by using collinearity statistics, and Variance inflation factor (VIF) >10 and tolerance
(T) <0.1 considered as suggestive of the existence of multi-collinearity. A crude and adjusted
odds ratio (OR) with 95%CI estimated, to identify factors affecting HCPs practice of
precautionary measures for COVID-19. In this study, P-value, <0.05 was considered to declare
a result as statistically significant.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
Ethical clearance obtained from Arba Minch University, College of Medicine and Health
Sciences, Institutional Research Ethics Review Board (IRB) with reference number:
IRB/408/12. Written and signed voluntary consent obtained from all study participants before

Factors associated with the health professionals practice of the precautionary measures
for the COVID-19 pandemic
In a multivariable model, marital status (being married), good knowledge about COVID-19,
and a positive attitude towards precautionary measures had shown a significant association
with health professionals' practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Married health professionals were 1.84 times more likely to practice precautionary measures
for COVID-19 in the health facility as compared to counterparts (AOR=1.84, 95%CI: 1.06,
3.18). The odds of good practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19 pandemic were
2.02 in health professionals with good knowledge of COVID-19 (AOR=2.02, 95%CI: 1.02,
3.99). Health professionals with a positive attitude were 29% more likely to practice
precautionary measures for COVID-19 pandemic in a public health facility (AOR=3.29, CI:
2.09, 5.19) (Table 6).

Discussion
This survey aimed to fill a research gap in Ethiopia by assessing health professionals’ practice
of precautionary measures for COVID-19 in public health facilities. In this study, 2/3rd of
health professionals’ had knowledgeable about the COVID-19 pandemic, 1/2nd were a positive
attitude towards precautionary measures for COVID-19, and only 1/3rd had a good practice on
precautionary measures in public health facilities. Marital status, knowledge about COVID-19,
and attitude towards precautionary measures were factors identified in this study that showed
significant association with good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19
pandemic.
In this study, the magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19 was
35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%). These were very low as compared to studies conducted in Iran
(70.12%) [40], in China (89.7%)[38], the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (87.9%)[39], Uganda
(74%)[48], and Ethiopia (62%)[49]. The finding of this study indicated that 50.5% of health
professionals avoided touching mouse, eyes, and noses, and 68.9% had wash hands
continuously with water, soap, or use hand sanitizer. These were incongruent with studies
conducted in Pakistan (84.3% for avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth, and 96.1% for
hand washing and use sanitizer)[41], in two studies from Saudi Arabia, 24.2% [42], and
94.1%[43] use facemask in crowds. The observational finding of this study also indicated that
a gap in applying droplet and contact precautions (using PPEs), routinely cleaning and
disinfecting surfaces with which the patient contact and equipment used, and controlling
visitors (there is overcrowding) in the health facility. This discrepancy may be due to
differences in socio-demographic and economic characteristics, technological advancement
and health care system, and social-cultural factors. The other factor may be methodological
aspects (the majority of previous studies were an online survey (using email, Facebook, and
telegram) that may overestimate the practice).
The health professionals’ marital status was significantly associated with good practice of
precautionary measures for COVID-19. However, other socio-demographic and professional
factors (sex, age, educational attainment, job category/profession, and work experience) had
not shown significant association. These were not in line with studies conducted in China[38],
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia[39], Iran[40], Pakistan[41], and Uganda[48]. This difference
might related to sampling variation or sample clustering that previous studies mainly based on
an online survey, and participants are only those who access the internet service during the
data collection period. Besides, a health professional who continuously manages patients with
COVID-19 might not involve in that study due to time shortage. Coronavirus disease-2019 is a
global pandemic that all the information sources (mass media, stream media, social media, and
others) and all the government sectors give focus on this issue, and health professionals seek
information utmost an equal level. Therefore, the practice of precautionary measures for
COVID-19 in health facilities does not that much vary with sex, age category, educational
level, job category, and work experience difference.
In this study, knowledge of health professionals' on the COVID-19 had shown a significant
association with a good practice of precautionary measures in health facilities. These were in
line with studies conducted in Pakistan[41], Iran[40], the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia[39],
China[38], Ethiopia [49, 50], and Uganda[48]. Similarly, the attitude of the health
professionals’ towards precautionary measures had shown a significant association with

practice in the health facility. These were in line with the study conducted in Pakistan [41].
These are facts that health professionals who are knowledgeable about the pandemic and
positive attitude towards precautionary measures are more likely to put in practice. In general,
the positive attitude of the health professional is a base to seeking information about the
pandemic from different sources and concerning bodies to build knowledge and resulted in
behavioral change and to put the practice in the ground.
The main strength of this study was that it assessed the health professionals’ practice and
factors affecting precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic in the health facilities
with limited previous studies. It also used validated Open Data Kit survey tools to collect the
information.
The limitation of this study was the study might subject to recall and social desirability biases.
The study, conducted in a very constrained environment that different activities controlled by
the national emergency team due to the pandemic. The study was cross-sectional that the
causal relationship was under caution. Therefore, those issues must consider while interpreting
the study findings.
The implication of this study is; it involved health professionals in health facilities and health
professionals are in the front line to this pandemic, and different interventions are needed in
the ground route to improve service quality and to stable the health care system. Currently,
millions of individuals are infected, and thousands died with this evil disease. The pandemic
disrupts the health care system. Therefore, assessing the practice and identifying the factors
affect is very important to intervene urgently to squeal the consequence within a short period.
The finding of this study can urge different stakeholders, task forces, and public health
emergency teams to design strategies for intervention.
In summary, there are limited studies that showed the health professionals’ practice and
factors affecting precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study
aimed to fill these research gaps in Ethiopia. This study identified that there was a gap in the
practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19 among health professionals, and knowledge
and attitude towards precautionary measures were the most determinate factors. The
observational finding also supplementary for the results indicated based on interviewed data.
This study had its limitation, and the results must interpret by considering those limitations.
These results of this study can be input for different stakeholders and task forces to design
specific strategies for intervention.

Conclusions
This study showed that the practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic
was low. Even if, majority of the health professionals know about COVID-19, there was a
gap. Marital status, knowledge about COVID-19, and attitude towards the precautionary
measures identified as factors. Therefore, the investigators recommended that the ministry of
health and other concerning task forces should provide capacity-building activities such as inservice training, motivate and recognize staffs to improve the knowledge, and to change the
behavior or attitude of the health professionals.
