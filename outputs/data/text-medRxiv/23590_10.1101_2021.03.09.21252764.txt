Abstract

37

In this study, we present the results of the first large-scale multinational study (36,220 participants)

38

that measures vaccine hesitancy among Arab-speaking subjects. Our analysis shows a significant

39

rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabs in and outside the Arab region (83% and 81%, respectively).

40

The most cited reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and distrust in healthcare

41

policies, vaccine expedited production, published studies and vaccine producing companies. We

42

also found that female participants, participants 30-59 year-old, those with no chronic diseases,

43

those with lower-level of academic education, and those who do not know the type of vaccine

44

authorized in their countries are more hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination. On the other

45

hand, participants who regularly receive the influenza vaccine, health care workers, and those from

46

countries with higher rates of COVID-19 infections showed more vaccination willingness.

Introduction

51

It has been recognized early on that the race to produce Covid-19 vaccines will not halt the

52

pandemic unless there is a general acceptance by the public to take the vaccine1,2. Therefore, Covid-

53

19 vaccination hesitancy has been studied heavily before and since the early stage of vaccine

54

availability, with high variation in the willingness to be vaccinated among different communities3–

55

5

56

(n=13,426)6, 15 countries (n=18,526)7, 15 countries (n= 13,500)8, 14 countries (n= 12,777)9, and 7

57

countries (n = 7,662)1. Interestingly, none of which covered Arabic speaking nations. A smaller

58

multinational study that surveyed 3,414 participants was conducted in Jordan and Kuwait, with

59

minor participation from some other Arab countries10. This study showed that vaccine acceptance

60

was low (29.4%) and was lower in females, individuals with lower academic education, and

61

individuals with no chronic diseases.

62

Other studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia (n =1000)11 and (n=3,101)12, Egypt (n=559)13,

63

Jordan (n =3100)14, and the UAE (n =1,109)15. With the Arab nations having significant variations

64

socioeconomically, politically and in the measures taken to control the pandemic, the study of

65

reactions to and acceptance of the vaccine becomes necessary. Also, the authorization of the use

66

of Sinopharm vaccine by some Arab countries, despite the lack of sufficient safety and

67

effectiveness evidence16, may have an impact on the public’s trust in the vaccine and the health

68

policies in these countries. Furthermore, attitudes towards the vaccines are affected by complex

69

and dynamic interplaying factors, and considerable changes over time have been observed in

70

acceptance and hesitancy rates6–9,17–19. For all of these reasons, the earlier local studies cannot be

71

generalized to the Arab world and further larger studies will present a clearer picture of the region.

72

Arab countries and territories (23 in total) span a large geographical area in North Africa and West

73

Asia with a population of over 440 million20. The total reported number of COVID-19 cases in the

74

region until the mid-February 2021 was more than 4.1 million with 70.7 thousand deaths21

. Several large multinational studies on vaccine acceptance have been conducted in 19 countries

75

(Supplementary Fig 1). Yet, the Arab region is understudied, despite the geographical spread, the

76

number of residents, and the number of cases and deaths. So, a large-scale multinational study for

77

this area is necessary.

78

Our study aims to fill the gaps by investigating vaccine acceptance using a large-scale survey

79

targeting the relatively understudied Arab populations living in different countries around the

80

world following vaccine availability and administration. Secondly, to unveil the barriers leading to

81

vaccine hesitancy and their prevalence among the participants using an extensive updated list of

82

barriers against vaccine acceptance. Thirdly, the study compares the answers of the respondents

83

residing in and outside the Arab world to evaluate the effect of socioeconomic, cultural, health

84

policies and political differences on their reported attitudes and barriers to acceptance.

Methods

87

The Survey of Arab COVID-19 Vaccine Acceptance (SACVA) is an open online survey that was

88

conducted using the online platform www.surveyplanet.com from 14-Jan 2021 to 29-Jan, 2021.

89

The sample population was a convenience sample targeted through a digital campaign using social

90

media platforms. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained from the last author’s

91

institution. Unique IP addresses are allowed to participate once on the survey platform to prevent

92

multiple entries. Consent to participate was obtained at the first entry of the survey portal for each

93

participant. The platform allows participants to move through screens only when answers were

94

obtained, which prevents missing entries. The survey consisted of 17 questions, including the

95

consent to participate. All questions were written and validated in the Arabic language- an English

96

translation of the questions can be found on Supplementary Document 1. Questions two to nine

97

captured demographics and current health status; question 10 was about the annual influenza

98

vaccine; question 11 was about available vaccine(s) in each country (if known) and answers to

99

subsequent questions were directed based on the type of available vaccine(s). Questions 12 and 13

100

queried whether the participant received the COVID-19 vaccination and if they had any side

101

effects. Those who had already taken the vaccine were not allowed to answer question 14 which

102

queried participant’s acceptance/hesitance towards COVID-19 vaccine; these participants were not

103

included in the analysis reported in this paper. Questions 15 and16 surveyed participants' attitudes

104

towards the need for COVID-19 vaccination and associated health policies. Question 17 was a

105

detailed question that evaluated 29 barriers which potentially influenced the decision to receive the

106

vaccine in addition to "I do not have any reservations about taking the vaccine" option. We also

107

allowed participants who answered “Yes”, meaning they are willing to be vaccinated, to choose

108

from the 29 barriers.

109

Questions were discussed thoroughly among authors and other colleagues. Face validity was tested

110

by the third author, who has expertise in the domain. A pilot survey was then posted online and

111

100 individuals participated following direct contacts by authors. Analyzing responses and

112

comments of this pilot survey helped in refining the final survey and confirming its validity and

113

reliability.

114

The survey data was analyzed using R software- v.4.0.2. Descriptive statistics and analytical graphs

115

were used as needed. Participants were also subcategorized based on country of residence. Arab

116

countries with less than 100 participants (Somalia, Djibouti and Comoros) were grouped together

117

in one category and labeled “Other Arab countries”. The non-Arab countries where the Arabic

118

speaking respondents were residing were classified into groups: European countries (n=30), North

119

American countries (n=3), Turkey and the rest of non-Arab countries as others (n=88). The

120

answers to the 14th question, “Do you intend to take the vaccine?”, were used as a dependent

121

variable and were analyzed using binary logistic regression. Two of the answer choices (“Yes”,

122

“Depends on the type of vaccine”) were used to define vaccine acceptance while the other three

123

(“No”, “Not sure”, “I will wait and see its effects on others” ) were labeled as “Vaccine Hesitancy”.

124

Responses to the question of the barriers to acceptance (Question 17) were compared for gender,

125

academic education and country of residence using Chi-Square. Our acquisition and analysis of the

126

results followed the guidelines of the CHERRIES checklist22.

127

As for COVID-19 cases and death statistics, we used the COVID19 package- v2.3.2- which collects

128

data from different sources to provide up-to-date COVID-19 statistics23. The total number of

129

confirmed cases and deaths were correlated with vaccine acceptance in different Arab countries

130

using the Spearman correlation. The results of the survey can be found on the project’s website at

131

https://mainapp.shinyapps.io/CVHAA.

135

Demographics

136

Our online survey raw data were downloaded on January 29th, 2021; there were 38,485 participants

137

who started filling the survey of whom 36,958 consented and proceeded with the survey. A total

138

of 738 participants reported receiving COVID-19 vaccination before filling the survey and were

139

excluded from further analysis in this report bringing the total respondents who qualify for analysis

140

to 36,220. The participants cover all the 23 Arab countries and territories (n=30,200, 83.4%) and

141

Arabs who live in 122 other countries (n= 6,020, 16.6%). Participants from countries out of the

142

Arab region were clustered into four groups: Europe (N=3130, 52%), North America (n=748,

143

12.4%), Turkey (n=1630, 27.1%) and others (n=512, 8.5%).

144

The mean age was 32.6 years (±10.8). There were more males (n=22,040, 61.1%) than females

145

(n=14,180, 38.9%)- Supplementary Fig 2. Chronic diseases were reported by 5,839 participants

146

(16.1%). Previous COVID-19 infection- suspected or confirmed- was reported by 6,637 (18.3%)

147

participants; 11,458 (31.6%) other participants were not sure if they had contracted the virus.

148

Among the 4,494 participants who reported testing for COVID-19, there were 2,792 participants

149

with positive test results (62.1% positivity). Only 908 (2.5%) participants reported annual influenza

150

vaccine while 28,040 (77.4%) reported never receiving it. More than half of the participants had a

151

bachelor’s degree or higher (22,236, 61.4%). Being a health care worker was reported by 5,708

152

participants (15.8%). When asked about the type of vaccine available in their countries, 15,057

153

(41.6%) did not know the type, while vaccines made in China and the United States were reported

154

by 12,374 and 12,254 participants, respectively. Detailed participant characteristics are shown in

155

COVID-19 Vaccination Hesitancy and related factors

159

When asked about their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine if the option is available to them;

160

4,548 (12.6%) of the respondents answered “Yes”; 1,615 (4.5%), answered “Depends on the type

161

of vaccine”; 7,552 (20.9%) answered “I will wait and see its effects on others”; 7,856 (21.7%)

162

answered “I am not sure”; and 14,649 (40.4%) chose “No”. The first two choices were considered

163

acceptance to receive a vaccine while the last three were labelled as vaccine hesitancy (Fig 1).

164

Variations in responses were analyzed using different factors as covariates (Fig 2).

165

Respondents from the Arab Gulf countries (Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and UAE)

166

plus Libya and Sudan showed the highest willingness for vaccination while those who showed the

167

least willingness are participants from the west region (Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Morocco)-

168

Fig 1. Arabic speaking participants living in North America were more willing to receive

169

vaccination than those in the other three clusters (Fig 1, Table 2).

170

Several factors (shown in Fig 3, Table 3) were tested in a binomial logistic regression model to

171

examine their correlation with vaccine hesitancy. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed

172

that almost all tested factors were significant predictors for vaccine hesitancy, reflecting the large

173

sample size tested. Odds ratio showed the stronger effect of the following factors on participants’

174

hesitance: Never (OR, 4.04) or rarely (OR, 2.69) receiving the influenza vaccine, not knowing the

175

vaccine type available (OR, 1.93), female gender (OR, 1.91), and outside of the healthcare system

176

(OR, 1.84). Vaccine acceptance in each Arab country was correlated with the number of confirmed

177

COVID19 cases and deaths using Spearman correlation. It was found out that the number of cases

178

(p=0.0047) but not deaths (p=0.3) correlated significantly with vaccine acceptance- supplementary

Barriers to acceptance

207

There were 3,905 participants who chose acceptance but yet had one or more barrier(s) selected.

208

Of the 29 barriers, the most common responses were “I am afraid side effects of the vaccine will

209

develop, other than what has been disclosed”- 22,235 (61.4%), “Not enough time has passed to

210

verify the vaccine’s safety”- 20,172 (55.7%), “The vaccine production has been rushed, making

211

me doubt the credibility of the producing company”- 16,698 (46.1%), "I do not trust the healthcare

212

policies applied in my country"- 14,151 (39.1%), and “I do not trust the published studies, nor the

213

company producing the vaccine” in 11,968 responses (33%) (Fig 4).

214
215

Comparison of participants inside and outside the Arab World

216

Participants in the Arab World were slightly more likely to have vaccine hesitancy when compared

217

to those living outside (83.3% vs. 81.2%)- Fig 1. Those living in North America were the least

218

hesitant (76.3%) while those living in Turkey had the highest hesitancy (83.6%). Additionally,

219

participants living in Arab countries were more likely to report “I do not trust the healthcare policies

220

applied in my country”, “There are no published studies on the vaccine”, “I do not trust the

221

published studies, nor the company producing the vaccine”, “No need for the vaccine as rates of

222

viral infection are decreasing”, and “No need for the vaccine as most people in my country have

223

already been infected” (chi-square test, p<0.0001, with difference > 5% for all) (supplementary

224

table 1, supplementary Fig 4).

225
226

Attitudes towards vaccination policies and need

227

When asked about their opinions regarding suggested vaccination policies, participants’ responses

228

were: To let people choose if they want to take it or not (59.5%), to mandate it on populations in

229

which the vaccine was proven to be effective and safe as per clinical studies (13.6%), not sure

230

(10.9%), should not be given to anybody (6.1%), and To give work and transportation privileges

Discussion

244

This study presents the largest online survey on vaccine hesitancy that covered a heterogeneous

245

population of Arabic people living all over the globe. In addition, it bridged the gap in knowledge

246

on vaccine hesitancy in the Arab region. It shows low rates of vaccine acceptance in the face of the

247

ongoing pandemic. Only one in eight respondents (12.5%) reported their willingness to take the

248

vaccine. One in 22 (4.4%) based their decision on whether to take the vaccine or not on the type of

249

the vaccine, acknowledging that the vaccine type they prefer may not be available in the near future

250

and even when available, they may not be given the choice of selecting that vaccine type. These

251

results are of unique significance because the study has been conducted after the vaccine has

252

become available and administered to millions of people worldwide, and while about 70 different

253

vaccine candidates are currently under development.

254

The study also showed a clear correlation between acceptance and gender, academic background,

255

attitudes toward the flu shot, having been previously suspected of- or confirmed with- COVID-19

256

infection and knowledge of the vaccine type. Females were more hesitant to take the vaccine, while

257

the previous studies were inconclusive on the correlation of hesitance with gender, where women

258

were found to have higher24–26, equal13, or lower6,27 hesitancy compared with men. Our results

259

show lower acceptance in participants with current or previous suspected or confirmed Covid-19

260

infection (data) when compared with Lazarus et. al. (n=13,426) who found no significant

261

correlation6. On the other hand, our results are consistent with the literature in terms of lower

262

acceptance in people who do not get influenza vaccination5 and who have lower academic

263

education5,6.

264

Respondents who did not know the vaccine type available to them showed increased hesitancy.

265

This may be attributed to the fact that some Arab countries were first to approve the Sinopharm

266

vaccine despite lack of affirmative data16. The impact of vaccine efficacy on attitudes towards

267

vaccination has been echoed in the study of Harapan et. al. (n=1,359)28, conducted before vaccine

268

availability, where 93.3% of respondents chose to be vaccinated with a 95% effective vaccine, but

269

this acceptance rate decreased to 67.0% in the case of a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. The

270

results showed a level of mistrust in healthcare policies in Arab countries (44%) which can also be

271

attributed to the selection of certain vaccines, as well as the inability to choose which vaccine to

272

take. all of these factors may contribute to high hesitance when the vaccine type is unknown to the

273

participant.

274

Consistent with previous studies28,29, health care workers were more accepting of the vaccine,

275

although with still low proportions of about one in four (18% yes and 7.1% depending on the type).

276

One study on Congolese health care workers (n=613) conducted in March-April, 2020 reported a

277

similar notably low rate of acceptance (only 27.7%)30. In addition, consistent with the results of

278

the multinational study by Lazarus et. el. (n=13,426)6, participants from countries with higher per

279

million Covid-19 cases were more likely to welcome the vaccine. Participants between the ages of

280

30 and 59 were less willing to receive vaccination compared with older participants, an expected

281

result given the fact that COVID-19 severity is associated with older age. However, younger

282

participants (<29 years old) showed more willingness to be vaccinated.

283

Among the 29 different reasons for vaccine rejection/hesitancy, the top two reasons selected by the

284

respondents reflected concerns about safety while the next three most prevalent reasons were issues

285

of distrust. This is consistent with the literature which showed high levels of distrust and concern

286

about safety5.

287

The three forms of distrust (in healthcare policies, in vaccine expedited production and in published

288

studies) were notably higher among respondents residing in the Arab countries than those living

289

outside the Arab world. The same applies to the belief that the vaccine has not been tested on a

290

large enough number of people, just tens or hundreds, which reflects less awareness of the vaccine

291

development process in the Arab countries and highlights the need to educate the general public

292

on the subject. Similarly, more residents of the Arab world believe that the vaccine is not necessary

293

anymore because most people in the participant’s country “have already been infected” or because

294

the infection rate is decreasing. The infection rate is in fact decreasing (supplementary Fig 1, panel

295

A) but the public may need to be made aware that future outbreaks are still a possibility.

296

With the high rate of distrust, any form of coercion to take the vaccine may have negative impacts.

297

Lazarus’s et. al. large-scale study indicated that promoting voluntary acceptance is a better route

298

and that coercion should be avoided6. Similarly, a systematic review indicated that “mandates could

299

increase resistance”5. In our study, the majority of participants (59.5%) believed that vaccination

300

should be left to individual choices and only a minority believed it should be mandated for certain

301

categories of people (6.1%) or on populations in which the vaccine was proven to be effective and

302

safe as per clinical studies (13.6%).

303

Approximately one-fifth of our respondents chose “The vaccine might lose its efficacy against the

304

new viral strains'' as a reason for hesitation. The survey was published shortly after reports of the

305

new viral strains in the UK and South Africa have been made public, and with the recent reports

306

of decreased efficacy of some vaccines31,32, this concern of efficacy is expected to increase among

307

the public.

308

Several factors appear to contribute to the low level of vaccine acceptance in the current study

309

compared with the previous works. First of all, the response to the question of willingness is broken

310

down from Yes/No or Likert scale (in previous works) to a spectrum of choices which could more

311

accurately detect the hesitant respondents who could have otherwise chosen (Yes) or

312

(Agree/Strongly agree). In a large-scale survey conducted in October, 2020 that included 18,526

313

adults across 15 countries7, 73% strongly agreed or agreed that “if a vaccine for COVID-19 were

314

available, I would get it”. However, of those, only 22% agreed that they would become vaccinated

315

‘immediately after the vaccine is available’, while some others chose that they would wait for a

316

year and even longer. The same study found out that there is less certainty about getting vaccinated

317

among those who will wait. Thus, the affirmative nature of the Yes/No and 5-point Likert scales

318

do not seem to reflect the true nature of hesitancy and whether or not it changes its nature over

319

time.

320

In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on

321

Immunization defined vaccine hesitancy as a ‘delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite

322

the availability of vaccination services’33. We, therefore, question considering those who intend to

323

take the vaccine after a prolonged time of availability as “Accepting” since this may interfere with

324

the targeted achievement of collective immunity.

325

In the present study, 20.8% of the participants chose (I will wait and see its effects on others)-

326

many of whom could have possibly chosen (Yes) or (Agree) had the waiting choice been

327

eliminated. A systematic review noted that “When answer options included different timings for

328

vaccination, more people chose to wait than get it as soon as possible” and that the two answer

329

choices (Yes/No) received relatively high affirmatives5. Only three out of about 70 studies and

330

polls in this review included the choice of “wait a while until others have taken it” for the question

331

of vaccine acceptance. In these three polls, conducted before vaccine availability, the percentage

332

of those who chose that they would take the vaccine as soon as they can (or as soon as possible)

333

was low (21%-28%). This indicates that vaccine acceptance may be overestimated in many studies

334

and highlights the need to redefine vaccine acceptance in a uniform way among different studies.

335

Another factor that may explain the lower rate of acceptance observed in the study is the nature of

336

our survey population. Social and political differences were found to have a prominent effect on

337

Covid-19 vaccine acceptance, especially that many people assumed political interference in the

338

vaccine and in the pandemic itself5. Vaccine acceptance was lower in Arab countries in previous

339

studies: Jordan (37.4%)14, Saudi (64.72%)11, (44.7%)12, and in a small multinational survey that

340

included several countries, mainly Jordan and Kuwait (29.4%)10.

not show a linear relationship- if anything, the public’s acceptance can be best described as

fluctuating. Several surveys conducted in the last third of 2020 have shown a decrease in

344

vaccination acceptance compared with previous surveys5,7,17,26. For example, the intent to vaccinate

345

has declined in ten out of the 15 countries from August to October, 20207. A systematic review of

346

publications until 20 October, 2020 showed declining vaccine acceptance (from >70% in March to

347

<50% in October) with demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan divides observed5. However, a

348

more recent multinational survey conducted from November, 2020 to mid-January, 2021 in 15

349

countries18 and a study conducted from Jan 28th to 31st, 2020 in 14 countries9 have both shown an

350

increase in vaccine acceptance.

351

As for Arab countries, the more recent studies10,14,34 show lower acceptance rates than the earlier

352

ones. For example, A study conducted in Egypt (n=559) during March, 2020 found out that about

353

73.0% were looking forward to getting the vaccine when available11-13. However, the more recent

354

study on HCW in Egypt (n=496) during December, 2020 concluded that only 13.5% totally agree

355

to receiving the vaccine, and 32.4% somewhat agree34. In our survey that is more recent than the

356

mentioned studies, 17.0% and 24.0% of participants in Egypt (general [n= 5,339] and HCW [n=

357

1,250], respectively) were willing to take the vaccine.

358

A Saudi Arabia study published in May, 2020 observed that 64.7% of participants (n=1000)

359

showed interest to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available11, and another study conducted

360

during May (n=3,101) showed a 44.7% acceptance rate12. However, in a more recent study in Saudi

361

Arabia too, published in December 2020, 31.8% of participants (n=154) showed acceptance10. In

362

our survey that is more recent than the mentioned studies, 19.8% of participants from Saudi Arabia

363

(n=3,588) showed acceptance.

364

This study comes with few limitations. Similar to several previous surveys5, participants were

365

recruited through social media. Being an online survey, our study may have under-represented

366

certain groups of individuals, including members of older age groups and those who are not active

367

on social media. We cannot rule out selection bias that might have affected our results. Other

368

high-risk groups such as people with chronic diseases are well-represented (n=5,839) or even over-

369

represented (HCW, n=5,708). Our sample size was not pre-planned but was rather arbitrary

370

reflecting a convenience sample. We believe that the large number of participants and the

371

consistency of results in different countries that were geographically close and similar

372

socioeconomically confirm the reliability of our survey.

Conclusion

375

Our results show high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Arab respondents residing inside and

376

outside the Arab world after millions of people around the world have received the vaccine. The

377

main reasons for hesitancy are concerns about safety and distrust in healthcare policies, vaccine

378

expedited production and published studies, with the distrust being notably higher among

379

respondents residing in the Arab countries. Given that the vaccine is being purchased from state

380

expenditure, the high vaccine hesitancy could further compromise the economies of Arab countries

381

in addition to the pandemic health hazard. At the same time, mandating the vaccine is not a

382

desirable choice and could further increase the distrust. With the highly dynamic nature of the

383

pandemic and vaccine production process and the interplay of ever-changing factors that affect

384

vaccine acceptance, our study needs to be replicated at a later time to measure the change in public

385

acceptance. The high proportion of people willing to wait until others have received the vaccine

386

and the unavailability of the preferred vaccine for others shows a need to create a uniform definition

387

for vaccine acceptance in the surveys to avoid misestimation.
