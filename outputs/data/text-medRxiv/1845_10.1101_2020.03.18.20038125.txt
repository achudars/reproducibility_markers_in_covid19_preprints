Abstract
Background: The ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat.
Identification of markers for symptom onset and disease progression is a pressing issue. We
compared the clinical features on admission among patients who were diagnosed with asymptomatic,
mild, and severe COVID-19 at the end of observation.
Methods: This retrospective, single-center study included 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 from the mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship from February 11 to
February 25, 2020. Clinical records, laboratory data, and radiological findings were analyzed.
Clinical outcomes were followed up until February 26, 2020. Clinical features on admission were
compared among those with different disease severity at the end of observation. Univariate analysis
identified factors associated with symptom onset and disease progression.
Findings: The median age was 68 years, and 54 patients were male. Briefly, 43, 41, and 20 patients
on admission and 33, 43, and 28 patients at the end of observation had asymptomatic, mild, and
severe COVID-19, respectively. Serum lactate hydrogenase levels were significantly higher in 10
patients who were asymptomatic on admission but developed symptomatic COVID-19 compared
with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age,
consolidation on chest computed tomography, and lymphopenia on admission were more frequent in
patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild COVID-19 at the end of observation.

48

Interpretation: Lactate dehydrogenase level is a potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19.
Older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease
progression of COVID-19 and contribute to the clinical management.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the PubMed database from its inception until March 1, 2020, for articles published in
English using the keywords “novel coronavirus,” “2019 novel coronavirus,” “2019-nCoV,” “Severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,” “SARS-CoV2,” “COVID-19,” “mass infection,” “herd
infection,” “cruise ship,” ”Diamond Princess,” “asymptomatic,” and “subclinical.” There were no
published clinical studies featuring COVID-19 as a result of mass infection on board a cruise ship.
We found published articles entitled “Characteristics of COVID-19 infection in Beijing” and
“Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive
study,” which compared patients with asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19. However, none of
the studies described potential markers for symptom onset or disease progression in patients with
COVID-19.
Added value of this study
We present the differences in clinical characteristics of 104 patients with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 as a result of mass infection on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were treated at
Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital, Japan from February 11 to February 25, 2020. On admission,
43, 41, and 20 patients had asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively, whereas 33, 43,
and 28 patients were determined to have asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19, respectively, at
the end of observation. During the observation period, 10 of the 43 (23.3%) asymptomatic patients
on admission developed symptoms of COVID-19. Conversely, eight of the 84 (9.5%) patients with
asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 on admission developed severe disease during the observation
period. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who
were initially asymptomatic on admission to the hospital and developed symptomatic COVID-19
during the observation period compared with 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the
observation period. The prevalence rates of consolidation on chest computed tomography (CT)
images and lymphopenia were significantly higher in eight patients who developed severe
COVID-19 during the observation period compared with the 76 patients with asymptomatic or mild
disease at the end of the observation. Older age, consolidation on chest CT, and lymphopenia on
admission were more frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 28) than those with mild
COVID-19 (n = 43) at the end of observation. LDH level might be marker for symptom onset in
patients with COVID-19, whereas older age, consolidation on chest CT imaging, and lymphopenia
are potential risk factors for disease progression. The current report findings will contribute to the
improvement of clinical management in patients with COVID-19.
Implications of all the available evidence
Serum LDH level is a potential predictor of symptom onset of COVID-19, whereas older age,
consolidation on chest CT imaging, and lymphopenia have potential utility as markers for disease
progression.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). The first case was reported in Wuhan, China, in
December 2019, 1 and the ongoing outbreak has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization. Since specific treatment for COVID-19 is unknown, identification of patients at high
risk for severe illness is critical to prepare and provide sufficient supportive therapy. Additionally, an
explosive increase in case numbers has led to the collapse of healthcare systems. Therefore, triage of
patients and their transportation to proper facilities are necessary. Although our knowledge of the
clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV2 are increasing, detailed
clinical characteristics of the disease remain unknown; most of the published studies to date focus on
patients with severe COVID-19. 2-5 In Japan, a large number of infections occurred among the
passengers and crew members on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February 2020. By
March 1, 2020, there were approximately 700 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2
infection. 6,7 Approximately 3700 passengers and crew members on the cruise ship were tested for
SARS-CoV2 by reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and all symptomatic
and asymptomatic cases were referred to medical institutions designated for infectious diseases in
accordance with the Infectious Diseases Control Law of Japan. 6,7 Approximately 15% of all
laboratory-confirmed cases from Diamond Princess were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces
Central Hospital in Japan.
In clinical settings, identifying patients who are at risk of symptom onset and clinical deterioration is
essential. Therefore, understanding the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 of
different severity is necessary. To that end, we retrospectively analyzed the detailed clinical
characteristics of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 as a result of the Diamond Princess outbreak,
including those with asymptomatic, mild, and severe disease presentation, who were treated in the
Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan.

Methods
Study design and patients
We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 104 patients with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in
Japan between February 11 and February 25, 2020. Approximately 3700 passengers on the cruise
ship were examined by quantitative RT-PCR or nested RT-PCR for SARS-CoV2 using pharyngeal
swabs or sputum specimens at the public health institutes based on the recommendations protocol by
the National Institute of Infectious Disease. 6-8 This study was reviewed and approved by the Japan
Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital (approval number 01-011). Informed consent, both written and
oral, was obtained from all enrolled patients.
Data collection
Patient information was retrospectively collected from the hospital medical records and included

clinical records, laboratory findings, and chest CT images. All data were collected and reviewed by
two study investigators (ST and KI).
Definitions
The geographical regions were classified according to the standard country or area codes for
statistical use (M49) by the United Nations Statistics Division
(https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/). Asymptomatic cases were defined as patients with
no history of clinical signs and symptoms. Severe symptomatic cases were defined as patients
showing clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnea, tachypnea, peripheral capillary oxygen
saturation <93%, and need for oxygen therapy). 9 Patients with other symptoms were classified as
mild cases. The observation period was defined as the time interval between the date of admission
and the date of discharge or February 26, 2020.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviation or medians with interquartile
range (IQR) and compared using Student’s t test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for parametric and
nonparametric data, respectively. Categorical variables were expressed as numbers (%) and
compared by the χ2 or Fisher’s exact test. A two-sided p value of less than 0·05 was considered to be
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were calculated using Stata13 (Stata Corp, College
Station, TX, USA).
Role of the funding source
There was no funding source for this study. The corresponding author had full access to all
study-related data and had final responsibility for the decision to submit the study for publication.

Results
During the observation period, a total of 107 patients on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were hospitalized in the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in
Japan. Three patients were excluded from the study because of withdrawal of consent to join the
study. Therefore, the remaining 104 patients were included in the final analysis. The patients’ clinical
history, physical examination, and chest CT findings were evaluated on the day of admission, and all
blood tests were completed within the first 2 days following admission. The characteristics of 104
patients are presented in Table 1. Briefly, the patient age ranged from 25 to 93 years (median, 68
years; IQR, 46·75–75 years), and 54 (51·9%) patients were male. Most of the patients were from
Eastern Asia, with Japanese and Chinese ethnicities as the majority. The range of observation period
was 3–15 days (median, 10 days; IQR, 7–10 days). Fifty-two (50·0%) patients had comorbidities.
Based on their presentation on the day of admission, 43 patients (41·4%) who did not display any
symptoms were classified as asymptomatic, whereas 41 (39·4%) and 20 (19·2%) patients were
classified to have mild and severe COVID-19, respectively.

The clinical findings of the patients who were symptomatic on the day of admission and at the end of
observation period are shown in Table 2. At the end of the observation, there were 33 (31·7%), 43
(41·3%), and 28 (26·9%) patients with confirmed asymptomatic, mild, and severe COVID-19,
respectively. The most common clinical signs and symptoms on admission among the 71
symptomatic patients at the end of the observation were fever (42·3%) and cough (40·8%). Of the 43
patients who were asymptomatic on admission, 10 (23·3%) patients developed symptomatic
COVID-19 during the observation period, including three (7·0%) patients who developed severe
COVID-19 and required supplemental oxygen therapy. Conversely, five of the 41 (12·2%) patients
with mild disease on admission developed severe COVID-19 and required supplemental oxygen
therapy. Therefore, eight of the 84 (9·5%) patients with asymptomatic or mild presentation on
admission developed severe COVID-19 during the observation period. Additionally, of the 71
patients who were symptomatic at the end of the observation, 14 (13·5%) and one (1·4%) patient
required oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, respectively, whereas 10 (14·1%) and five
(7·0%) patients were treated by antibiotics and lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively. There were no
reports of complications or death during the observation period.

The characteristics of 10 patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the observation
period among those who were asymptomatic on admission are presented in Table 3. Among these 10
patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19, the most frequent symptom was cough (n = 7,
70·0%). Conversely, 17 of the 33 (51·5%) patients never developed symptoms until the end of the
observation period had abnormal lung findings with various patterns on CT images (Table 3 and
Figure 1). By univariate analysis, there were no significant differences in the distribution of age, sex,
and comorbidities or the prevalence of abnormal lung findings and CT patterns between the
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The prevalence of elevated LDH levels above 230 IU/L was
significantly higher in patients who were initially asymptomatic but developed symptomatic
COVID-19 during the observation period (50·0% vs 12·1%; odds ratio [OR], 7·25; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1·43–36·70; p = 0·02).

In the group of eight patients who developed severe COVID-19 during the observation period, the
age range was 42–87 years (median, 70 years; IQR, 70–77 years), and five (62·5%) patients were
male. The period from symptom onset to the reclassification of disease presentation as severe
COVID-19 ranged from 1 to 5 days (median, 4 days; IQR, 2·5–5 days). Additionally, all eight
patients (100·0%) developed radiographical abnormalities on CT prior to the emergence of
symptoms of typical pneumonia including tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxemia (Figure 2).
Furthermore, among these patients who developed severe COVID-19 during the observation period,
4 (50·0%) and 3 (37·5%) patients lacked the symptoms of cough and fever, respectively. We also
compared these eight patients who developed severe COVID-19 with 76 patients who remained
asymptomatic or had mild COVID-19 at the end of the observation period. By univariate analysis, no

significant differences were observed in the distribution of age, sex, and comorbidities between the
two groups. The prevalence rates of consolidation (75·0% vs 19·7%; OR, 12·20; 95%CI, 2·23–66·59;
p = 0·04) and lymphopenia (62·5% vs 25·0%; OR, 5·00; 95%CI, 1·10–22·92; p = 0·04) on the day of
admission were significantly higher in patients who developed severe COVID-19 during the
observation period than in those who were asymptomatic or had mild disease at the end of the
observation period.

Finally, we performed analyses to identify differences in the clinical characteristics between patients
with mild and severe COVID-19 at the end of the observation period (Table 4). By univariate
analysis, age was significantly higher in the severe COVID-19 group than in the mild COVID-19
group (median, 72·5 years; IQR, 55·25–76·5 years vs median, 60 years; IQR, 40·0 –71·0 years;
p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in the distribution of sex, comorbidities, clinical
signs, and symptoms between the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in the
prevalence of consolidation as a CT pattern between the severe and mild cases (46·4% vs 20·9%; OR,
3·27; 95%CI, 1·15–9·30; p = 0·03). Among the blood tests, the rate of lymphopenia was higher in
patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with mild COVID-19 at the end of the observation
period (57·1% vs 23·3%; OR, 4·40; 95% CI; 1·57–12·32; p = 0·005).

Discussion
The present retrospective, single-center study provides a summary of the clinical features of patients
who developed COVID-19 of varying severity as a result of mass infection on board a cruise ship.
The LDH levels were significantly higher in 10 patients who were initially asymptomatic on
admission to the hospital and developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the observation period than
in 33 patients who remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period. Older age,
consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia at the time of admission were significantly more
frequent among 28 patients with severe COVID-19 than among 43 patients with mild COVID-19 at
the end of the observation period. Overall, these findings suggest that serum LDH level might be a
marker of symptom onset and that older age, consolidation on chest CT images, and lymphopenia are
potential risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19.

The predictors of symptom onset and risk factors for disease progression in COVID-19 remain
partially unclear because patients who are asymptomatic or are otherwise exhibiting mild symptoms
do not necessarily visit a hospital. During the COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise
ship, approximately 3700 individuals on board were tested for SARS-CoV2 by RT-PCR, and all
laboratory-confirmed patients were referred to the hospitals. This unique situation allowed us to
observe the clinical course of asymptomatic patients as well as those with mild and severe symptoms,
which has not been reported to date. 2-5

Based on the previously published findings of COVID-19 in China, old age, male sex, and presence
of comorbidities are considered as potential risk factors for disease progression and poor prognosis.
1,10
Zhou et al. indicated that older age, high sequential organ failure assessment score, and elevated
d-dimer level were potential risk factors for death in patients with COVID-19. 11 Qin et al. reported
that lymphopenia and higher neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio were frequently observed in patients with
severe COVID-19 compared with those with mild disease. The present study findings support those
of previous reports suggesting older age and lymphopenia as potential risk factors for disease
progression in COVID-19. Lymphopenia, a common feature of symptomatic COVID-19, 12,13 can be
a direct consequence of SARS-CoV2 or might be mediated by cytokines. Qin et al. also suggested
that SARS-CoV2 infection might affect T lymphocytes and dysregulate the immune system,
consequently leading to secondary bacterial infections. 14 In the present study, we observed
lymphopenia in 27.3% of the patients who were asymptomatic at the end of observation period,
which suggests the development of immune system dysregulation as a direct consequence of
SARS-CoV2 infection in asymptomatic cases. However, the role lymphopenia in asymptomatic
patients remains unclear. Further cohort studies are warranted to determine the effect of lymphopenia
caused by SARS-CoV2 infection in the presence of secondary bacterial infection.

In the present study, the prevalence of consolidation detected by chest CT was significantly higher in
severe cases than in mild cases. Consolidation was also frequently detected in patients who
developed severe COVID-19 during the observation period. Pan et al. and Shi et al. reported that
abnormal lung findings varied from ground glass opacities (GGOs) to consolidation during the
course of COVID-19 and that the appearance of consolidation was more frequent within 1–3 weeks
after the symptom onset. 15,16 Previous studies found that 55% of patients with COVID-19 developed
dyspnea in a median of 8 days (IQR, 5.0–13.0 days) after symptom onset; 1 thus, the development of
consolidation on CT is associated with disease deterioration. Generally, consolidation is easily
detectable by chest X-ray, which therefore might be useful for the evaluation of risk for disease
progression in patients with COVID-19 in settings with limited resources.

Additionally, CT imaging revealed a high prevalence of lung abnormalities in patients with
COVID-19. The various patterns of abnormal lung findings were observed in asymptomatic cases
(51·5%) as well as in symptomatic cases (69·0%) at the end of the observation period. In their report
focusing on CT imaging findings of COVID-19, Shi et al. also noted the presence of abnormal lung
findings in asymptomatic patients. 16 Bai et al. investigated the common radiological characteristics
of COVID-19 pneumonia and reported that chest CT had a diagnostic sensitivity of 73%–93% and a
specificity of 93%–100% in distinguishing COVID-19 from viral pneumonia. 17 Therefore, chest CT
imaging might also be useful diagnostic tool for the asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with
COVID-19. In the present study, all eight patients who developed severe COVID-19 during the
observation period presented with CT abnormalities, in advance of the appearance of typical

pneumonia symptoms such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Of these eight patients, four and
three patients lacked the symptoms of cough and fever, respectively. These findings highlight that
COVID-19 pneumonia silently progresses without any remarkable symptoms. Conversely, the
majority of asymptomatic patients with radiological abnormalities on CT imaging did not develop
severe pneumonia. The differences observed in the clinical outcomes might be associated with
patient background characteristics as well as the genetic and pathogenic diversity of SARS-CoV2.
Understanding CT abnormalities relevance to the duration of virus shedding and the incidence of
secondary bacterial pneumonia is important to improve the clinical management of COVID-19.
Further investigation is necessary to clarify the clinical impact of CT findings in patients with
asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.

Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the rate of patients with elevated LDH levels
between those who developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the observation period and those who
remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period, although there was no significant
difference in the prevalence of lymphopenia between the two groups. Elevated serum LDH levels are
associated with lung tissue damage, 18 and serum LDH is considered as a marker for disease activity
and progression in pneumonia due to various etiologies. 19,20 Given that abnormal lung findings are
frequently observed in patients with asymptomatic COVID-19, these findings implicate that an
elevated LDH level might also reflect lung tissue damage by COVID-19 and might be considered as
a predictor for symptom onset in COVID-19. Patient assessment with determination of serum LDH
levels and chest CT imaging might facilitate the successful dedication of medical resources to
patients who are at higher risk for disease progression in the setting of mass infections as well as in
normal clinical settings.

The major limitations of the present study were selection bias and low number of patients. We
enrolled an ideal, homogeneous cluster of relatively healthy individuals who could remain on board a
cruise ship for a relatively long term. Therefore, the patient population was not an exact
representation of normal clinical settings. Triage on the Diamond Princess cruise ship before
emergency transportation has also introduced a selection bias with an atypically large number of
patients. The Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo is close to the Yokohama port where the
cruise ship was docked, and the symptomatic cases were referred to the study hospital. However, the
critical cases were preferentially referred to neighboring hospitals in Yokohama. Likewise, several
clinical signs and symptoms, which have occurred and disappeared before the patients were referred
to our hospital, may be included or excluded from this study. In addition, laboratory tests and CT
images were obtained once in majority of the patients, and the present study was not able to
determine changes in lymphocyte count and radiological findings over the course of observation.
Therefore, multicenter, multi-national cohort studies should be conducted to determine predictive
markers for symptom onset and risk factors for diseases progression.

Conclusion
The present study highlights the clinical features of patients who developed COVID-19 as a result of
mass infection on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Our analyses reveal serum LDH level as a
potential predictor of symptom onset in COVID-19. Age, consolidation on chest CT images, and
lymphopenia might be risk factors for disease progression. These findings contribute to a better
understanding of the clinical course and access points to improve disease management in patients
with COVID-19. Additional cohort studies are warranted to determine predictors for symptom onset
and risk factors for disease progression.
