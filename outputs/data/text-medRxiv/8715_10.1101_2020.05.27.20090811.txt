Abstract:
Background: SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is important for understanding immunity prevalence, and
may have implications for healthcare workers (HCW) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods:
We conducted immunologic testing of healthcare workers to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
IgG in this population. HCW were advised to wait at least two weeks from time of symptom onset or
suspected exposure before undergoing testing. All participants were self-reported asymptomatic for at
least three days at the time of testing. Results: Two hundred eighty-five samples were collected from
March 24, 2020 to April 4, 2020. The average age of participants was 38 years (range 18-84), and 54%
were male. Thirty-three percept tested IgG positive, 3% tested weakly positive, and 64% tested
negative. Neither age nor sex was associated with antibody development. Conclusion: Thirty-six
percent of HCW had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of inpatient and
ambulatory frontline staff to this viral illness, most of whom had minimal symptoms and were working
in the weeks preceding testing. While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions per
CDC guidelines for all HCW, HCW with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers
as we learn if our IgG antibodies confer immunity. Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns
regarding personal risk as this pandemic continues.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is important for understanding immunity prevalence, and may have
implications for healthcare workers (HCW) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While it remains
unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation confers immunity, based on patterns seen in other
viral illnesses, it is possible IgG presence may protect against reinfection.

HCW in the Mount Sinai Health System, a large, urban, academic tertiary care center, are at high risk
for disease exposure as they live in areas with high rates of community spread and work in
environments predominantly caring for SARS-CoV-2 patients. (1) Given limited availability of PCR
testing, many HCW self-diagnose illness and self-isolate until resolution of symptoms, in accordance
with Department of Health guidelines. (2)

We conducted immunologic testing of HCW to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in this
population.

Methods
We collected serum IgG antibody titers from self-referred HCW throughout our health system using a
serologic ELISA assay. (3) In week one, we tested HCW in departments with the greatest exposure to
aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., emergency medicine, critical care, anesthesiology), and in week two
tested all interested HCW with direct patient exposure. HCW were advised to wait at least two weeks
from time of symptom onset or suspected exposure before undergoing testing. (4) All participants were
self-reported asymptomatic for at least three days at the time of testing. Serum IgG titers were
considered “positive” if detected at dilutions of 1:320 or greater and “weakly positive” if detected at
dilutions of 1:50 to 1:160. Titers of 1:320 or greater were eligible for serum plasma donation. One-way
ANOVA test and Fisher’s exact test were used to compare results among groups. Specimens were

collected as part of our convalescent plasma donor identification and treatment program. This study
received IRB exemption.

Results
Two hundred eighty-five samples were collected from March 24, 2020 to April 4, 2020. The average
age of participants was 38 years (range 18-84), and 54% were male. Thirty-three percept tested IgG
positive, 3% tested weakly positive, and 64% tested negative. Neither age nor sex was associated with
antibody development (Table 1). Nine percent were Ab positive in week one versus 44% in week two.

Discussion
Thirty-six percent of HCW had IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, reflecting the high exposure of
inpatient and ambulatory frontline staff to this viral illness, most of whom had minimal symptoms and
were working in the weeks preceding testing. Interestingly, while HCW in the first week of our study
were in high risk departments, a larger proportion of HCW in the second week tested positive, likely
reflecting the longer time course required for antibody development and the rise in community
incidence. A limitation of our study was HCW who were eager to learn their antibody status may have
presented too soon after exposure, leading to potential false negative testing. Additionally, it is possible
that HCW with higher suspicion of infection were more likely to self-refer, potentially overestimating
the rate of antibody positivity.

While we continue to recommend standard protective precautions per CDC guidelines for all HCW,
HCW with SARS-CoV-2 IgG may become our safest frontline providers as we learn if our IgG
antibodies confer immunity. Knowing IgG antibody status may ease concerns regarding personal risk
as this pandemic continues. The next step will be to screen a larger proportion of our workforce in

will help us better understand duration of IgG response.
