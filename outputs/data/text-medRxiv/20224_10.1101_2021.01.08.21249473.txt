Abstract
Background
Migrant populations (defined as foreign-born) are one of several under-immunised groups in the
EU/EEA, yet little is known about how they are affected by outbreaks of vaccine-preventable
diseases (VPDs). This information is vital to develop targeted strategies to improve the health of
diverse migrant communities and to assess risk factors and correlations with major European
peaks in incidence of key VPDs over time.
Methods
We did a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019157473; Medline, EMBASE, and Global Health
January 2000 to October 2019) adhering to PRISMA guidelines, to identify studies on VPD
outbreaks (measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, hepatitis A, N meningitidis, and
H influenzae) in migrants residing in the EU/EEA and Switzerland.
Results
45 studies were included, reporting on 47 distinct VPD outbreaks across 13 countries (26 [55%]
were reported between 2010 and 2020, including 16 [34%] since 2015). Most reported outbreaks
involving migrants were of measles (n=24; 6578 total cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 596
cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1510 cases), rubella (n=3; 487 cases) and mumps (n=2; 295 cases). 19
(40%) of outbreaks, predominantly varicella and measles, were reported in temporary camps or
shelters for asylum seekers and refugees. Of 11 varicella outbreaks, 82% were associated with
adult migrants. Half of measles outbreaks (n=12) were associated with migrants from Eastern
European countries, often involving migrants of Roma ethnicity.
Conclusions
Migrants represent one of several under-immunised groups involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe,
with adult and child refugees and asylum seekers residing in shelters or temporary camps at
particular risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Vulnerability varies by disease, setting, and
individual demographics, highlighting the importance of tailoring strategies for implementing
catch-up vaccination to specific groups, alongside the strengthening of routine data collection, in
order to meet regional and global vaccination targets. Better understanding vaccine uptake and
demand issues in migrant groups, and reducing the barriers they face to accessing vaccination
services, is urgently needed, with direct implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery at the current

Introduction
Migration to the EU/EEA and Switzerland has risen substantially in recent years and includes a
diverse group of asylum seekers, refugees, labour migrants, EU/EEA internal migrants, and
undocumented migrants from many regions of the world, with considerable implications for
health services (1). Migrants are considered to be one of several under-immunised groups in
Europe (1-3). The European Vaccine Plan asks Member States to pay particular attention to
migrants, international travellers, and other marginalised communities to ensure their access to
effective and culturally appropriate immunisation services (4). Migrants in Europe may come
from countries with limited or disrupted health and vaccination systems and may therefore be
unaligned with the vaccination schedule of their host country. Certain settings, such as refugee
camps and immigration detention centres, may also be extremely conducive to vaccinepreventable disease (VPD) outbreaks with unsanitary living conditions, lack of access to
healthcare often combined with low vaccination coverage of residents (5).
Migrants may face barriers in access to health services, exclusion from services due to lack of
entitlement to free health care, and inconsistencies in delivery of care, including for catch-up
vaccinations and other preventative health-care services (7, 8). There are currently shortfalls in
catch-up vaccination delivery for migrants on arrival to the EU/EEA, particularly among older
age-groups outside routine childhood vaccination schedules. Language is often a key barrier for
migrants accessing vaccination services (6) as well as a lack of systems in place for catch-up
vaccination in adolescent and adult migrants (7). Some migrants may also fear approaching
healthcare providers, including vaccination services, because of links with immigration
authorities (8). Data suggest that low confidence in vaccination could also contribute to low
immunisation coverage of some migrant groups (9, 10), yet it is unclear to what extent migrants
– or specific nationality groups – are vaccine hesitant (11). These factors hold immediate
relevance to current COVID-19 vaccination roll-out, with ethnic minority groups in one study
associated with low intent to vaccinate for COVID-19 in the UK and US (12).
Although migrant communities have been affected by VPD outbreaks in EU/EEA countries, the
link between migration and outbreaks has been poorly elucidated to date. It is essential that
further research is carried out to identify drivers and risk-factors to inform targeted strategies

for improving vaccination uptake in at-risk populations. Several major measles outbreaks have
been recorded in Europe in recent years, with over 60,000 cases reported since January 2015
(data to September 2020), thought to involve under-vaccinated adult migrants (13, 14). Major
measles clusters in Greece, Belgium and Germany during 2019 suggested that migrants from
Eastern European countries may be heavily affected compared to other populations (15-17).
However, regional databases do not routinely collate data on VPD incidence disaggregated by
migrant status, meaning the vaccination of migrants is currently a poorly evidenced aspect of
public health policy in Europe. What data do exist is often not disaggregated and therefore gives
little information on high-risk groups, including specific nationalities. These data are vital if we
are to develop effective and targeted vaccination interventions to ensure immunisation
coverage reaches established Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) targets to prevent VPD outbreaks
(18, 19). Ensuring high levels of vaccination coverage is a key priority for European countries
through the European Vaccine Action Plan, to prevent outbreaks with unnecessary morbidity,
mortality and costs to health care systems.
We therefore did a systematic review to collate data from all outbreaks of key VPDs involving
migrants in EU/EEA countries and Switzerland, to identify key risk factors and drivers involved.

Methods
Search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria
We did a systematic literature review in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (20) and registered on PROSPERO
(CRD42019157473). Primary outcomes were migrant cases of vaccine-preventable diseases as
part of an outbreak; secondary outcomes were risk factors associated with having a VPD (age,
nationality, migrant status, setting, immunisation status). We searched Embase, Global Health,
and MEDLINE for peer-reviewed primary research reporting on VPD outbreaks involving migrant
populations in the EU/EEA and Switzerland between January 1st 2000 and May 22nd 2020, with no
language restrictions. Following a search of relevant systematic reviews and consulting with
experts in the field, a Boolean search strategy was developed containing terms relating to
migration, outbreaks of VPD and European location (see Supplementary file for full search terms).
We defined a migrant as any individual born outside of the country in which data were collected.
We included papers reporting primary data from observational studies (e.g. cross-sectional, case-

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249473; this version posted January 9, 2021. The copyright holder for this

control or cohort studies and outbreak or case reports), conference abstracts and systematic
reviews (where they presented data not published elsewhere). Comments, editorials, literature
reviews and letters were excluded. Non-English papers were included to ensure that the review
is representative of outbreaks occurring across Europe. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they
reported primary data on one or more outbreaks involving at least one migrant in the EU/EEA and
Switzerland where migrant status was clear.
We used the WHO definition to define an outbreak: “the occurrence of cases of disease in excess
of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season. An
outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries. It
may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years. A single case of a communicable disease
long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously
recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may
also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated”(21). Therefore, for all
diseases except polio, reports of single, unlinked cases of disease were excluded. Polio has been
absent from the European region since 2002 (22, 23), therefore a single case would be considered
an outbreak and included. Data not disaggregated into distinct outbreaks were included in the
narrative synthesis but excluded from spatial mapping. For studies reporting on multiple
outbreaks, data was extracted separately for each outbreak. Where multiple studies reported on
the same outbreak, the most complete description of the outbreak was included, with multiple
reports included when necessary to provide required data.
Outbreaks pertaining to the following diseases were included: diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae
type b (Hib), hepatitis A, measles, mumps, N. meningitidis, pertussis, polio and rubella. We
searched for studies from the following EU/EEA countries and Switzerland: Austria, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
and the UK.
Exclusion criteria were studies in which data were not transparently reported for migrants or
migrant status could not be identified, studies reporting on fewer than two cases of a disease
(except for polio), on an expected number of cases for the area or on multiple but clearly unlinked cases. Studies reporting on cases of vaccine-derived polio as opposed to wild-type polio
were also excluded.

Data screening, extraction, and synthesis
AD carried out title and abstract screening, full text screening, data extraction, and quality
assessment, with all steps duplicated by an independent second reviewer (SH, RH or AB), in line
with PRISMA guidelines. Where decisions could not be reached, two further reviewers (SEH, KR)
arbitrated. All titles and abstracts were screened for their relevance and eligibility. Full text
screening was carried out for all potentially eligible studies, and reasons for exclusion recorded.
Data were extracted on the following, where available: Time period of outbreak (year, month,
duration), location (country, setting i.e. temporary camps [defined as: refugee camps, shelters,
asylum residences or detainment centres] or general community, population affected (migrant
status [e.g. refugee, asylum seeker, students, workers], age-group, gender, nationality, ethnicity)
number of cases, migrant proportion of cases, index case, reported immune status of cases (oral
vaccine history or measured antibody titres), diagnostic methods and genotyping data. Where an
outbreak resulted in cases in multiple settings, the setting where the majority of cases were found
was reported.
Quality assessment of the included studies was carried out independently by two reviewers using
the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool (20). 10 points were allocated to each study,
with scores of 8-10 considered high quality; 5-7 medium, 1-4 low. Studies were not excluded
based on quality assessment in order to increase transparency.
Spatial mapping analysis
Using the ggplot2 package in R (version 3.6.1), the number of cases in all published outbreaks
involving migrants was plotted against the GPS co-ordinates of the reported outbreak location.
Where an exact location was not provided, the GPS co-ordinates of the country were used. The
outbreaks were colour coded by disease type.

Results
Overview of included studies
45 studies were included, reporting 47 distinct VPD outbreaks across 13 EU/EEA countries and
Switzerland (Figure 1). Twenty-one outbreaks involving migrants (45%) were reported in these
countries between 2000 and 2010 and 26 (55%) were reported between 2010 and 2020,
including 16 (34%) since 2015. Two reports, from Spain and Germany, did not disaggregate
cases into distinct outbreaks, but presented all outbreak-related cases across a specific time
period (24, 25). Measles had the highest number of reports of outbreaks involving migrants
(n=24; 6496 cases), followed by varicella (n=11; 505 cases), hepatitis A (n=7; 1356 cases), rubella
(n=3; 487 cases) and mumps (n = 2; 293 cases). Table 1 summarises the characteristics of all
included studies. In terms of quality, 23 papers were of high quality, 16 medium and 6 low, with
research not excluded on the basis of quality.
Outbreak Characteristics and Settings
In 35 (74%) included outbreaks, the index case was a migrant; of which 19 outbreaks (56%) only
went on to subsequently infect migrants, and 6 (18%) only clearly reported migrant status for
the index case. 19 outbreaks (40%) were reported from hosting facilities for refugees and
asylum seekers (temporary camps, detention centres or mass accommodations) (16, 26-37),
whereas 26 (55%) outbreaks involving migrants were reported in the general community (17,
25, 37-58). Other settings in which outbreaks were reported included an American military base
(59) and a prison (60).
Of outbreaks occurring in hosting facilities for refugees and asylum seekers (n = 19), four
reported spread to members of the local population. During these four outbreaks, the
secondary cases among the local population were mostly limited; one case of hepatitis A in a
health care worker (HCW) based in an affected camp (34), three HCWs and one volunteer
infected with measles during an outbreak in the Calais refugee camps (26) and the son of an
asylum centre worker infected with varicella (33). However, one outbreak of measles originating
in asylum seekers (146 asylum seekers affected) in Berlin spread widely among the host
population, resulting in 1,344 cases overall, 345 hospitalisations and the death of a 1-year old
child (37). The most frequent outbreaks occurring in camp-settings were varicella (n=9) (24, 27,
30-33, 36) and measles (n=8) (16, 24, 26, 29, 35, 37), with nearly all (75%) varicella outbreaks
occurring in these settings, as shown in Figure 2.

Of outbreaks occurring in the community (n = 26), 17 (65%) reported a migrant index case.
These included two small outbreaks of hepatitis A in which the index cases were internationally
adopted children (41, 43), a rubella outbreak originating from a Brazilian woman living in Spain
(61), a small measles outbreak with a Somali child as the index case (57) and multiple measles
outbreaks with index cases from Eastern European countries, predominantly of Roma ethnicity.
The most common diseases causing outbreaks in the general community were measles (n=15),
hepatitis A (n=5) and rubella (n=3).
Geographical distribution of VPDs: Spatial mapping analysis
Germany (n=9) (16, 29, 32, 34, 37, 52, 56, 59, 62), Spain (n=8) (43-45, 48, 61, 63-65), Italy (n=6)
(33, 36, 40, 46, 47, 58, 60) and Greece (n=5) (28, 42, 50, 51, 54, 55) were the countries that most
frequently reported outbreaks involving migrants between 2000 and 2020. Two thirds (n=6) of
included outbreaks in Germany affected refugee or asylum-seeking populations, mostly in
temporary camps, 78% (n=7) were measles outbreaks and all but one were reported in 2010 or
later. All included outbreaks in Spain took place in the general community between 2000 and
2007. In Italy, the outbreaks included were equally distributed between 2000 and 2020 and half
of outbreaks were of varicella. Outbreaks reported from Greece were predominantly measles
(n=3) and all but one occurred in 2010 or later.
Other countries reporting outbreaks were Austria (n=1) (62), Belgium (n=1) (17), Croatia (n=2)
(53), England (n=2) (38, 66), France (n=3) (26, 27, 30), Ireland (n=2) (41, 49), Norway (n=2) (39,
57), Poland (n=3) (35) and Switzerland (n=3) (31). Some clustering of diseases by country was
observed, for example, rubella outbreaks involving migrants between 2000 and 2020 were only
reported in Spain (61, 64, 65). Figure 3 highlights the case-load of VPD outbreaks (n=43)
involving migrants by reported location, highlighting clustering.

Measles outbreaks in migrant populations
21 reports discussing measles outbreaks were included, reporting on 24 distinct outbreaks and
one report that presented all outbreak-related cases in asylum seekers in Germany from 2004 to
2014. Seven reports originated from Germany (16, 24, 29, 37, 52, 56, 59), four from Greece (50,
51, 54, 55), three from Italy (46, 47, 58), two from Spain (45, 48) and one each from Croatia (53),
France (26), Ireland (49), Norway (57) and Poland (35). A large proportion of outbreaks were
associated with Eastern European migrants, particularly of Roma nationality, including nine

outbreaks with an Eastern European index case (16, 37, 46, 47, 51, 52, 58, 62, 67, 68). Measles
outbreaks were frequently observed in refugee camps, residences or shelters, with a high
burden in children and adolescents in both Roma communities and refugee camps.
Between August 2009 and July 2011, a Europe-wide outbreak occurred, which peaked in March
2010 with 6,664 cases (14) and arose from a new strain of measles virus, D4-Hamburg, which
notably led to over 24,000 cases in Bulgaria (62). Nine reports of measles outbreaks involving
migrants were included from this time period (29, 49, 52-54, 56, 57, 62), of which six had a high
burden in migrants from Eastern European countries, mostly of Roma ethnicity (49, 52, 54-56,
62) and four had a Bulgarian index case (52, 54-56, 62). These outbreaks were often linked to
very low vaccination coverage in the affected populations. In one Greek outbreak, none of the
migrant cases had a recorded measles vaccination and in an Irish outbreak, only 14% and 2% of
cases had evidence of having had one and two measles vaccines, respectively (49, 54). The
Greek outbreak led to 83 hospitalisations, whereas in Ireland 115 hospitalisations occurred.
Post-2015, which saw a major influx of migrants to Europe (69), four measles outbreaks
involving migrants were reported, two of which took place in hosting facilities for asylum
seekers and refugees (16, 26). Another took place in Greece across 2017 and 2018 and was
responsible for 3150 cases, of whom the majority (80.4%) were unvaccinated, with three
Romanian Roma siblings reported as the index cases (51). Over half (61.3%) of the cases were
hospitalised, with complications reported in 17.1% of cases and four deaths.

Varicella in migrant populations
Ten reports discussing varicella outbreaks were included, reporting on eleven distinct outbreaks
and one report that presented all outbreak-related cases in asylum seekers in Germany from
2004 to 2014. Three reports came from Italy (33, 36, 60), two from France (27, 30) and Germany
(24, 32) and one each from Croatia (53), England (66) and Switzerland (31). Ten of the included
varicella outbreaks (83.3%) took place in refugee camps or asylum centres, of which only one
case resulted in spread to the general population; the son of an asylum centre worker was
infected following an outbreak in the centre (33). Populations involved in varicella outbreaks
were mainly African, Middle Eastern or South Asian, with the most frequently-reported
nationalities involved being Sudanese (27, 30, 33) and Somalian (31, 32, 66) (both n=3) followed
by Eritrean (27, 31) and Sri Lankan (31, 33) (both n=2). In all five papers where age-groups
involved were reported, the populations affected were adults.

Following the major influx of migration to Europe in 2015, a varicella outbreak took place in an
asylum centre in Italy, infecting 41 individuals of mostly East and West African origin (36).
Following this outbreak, serology testing was done in the asylum centre, showing that >20% of
East and Central Africans and South Asians were susceptible. Two outbreaks affected refugee
camps in the Calais area, with the first resulting in 12 cases, of whom two were hospitalised for
respiratory involvement, and the second 351 cases, of whom 90% were over 15 years old and
two went on to suffer from pulmonary complications (27, 30).

Hepatitis A outbreaks in migrants
Eight papers included in this review reported on hepatitis A outbreaks involving migrants. Two
papers reported on outbreaks occurring in Germany (24, 34), two in Spain (25, 43), two in
Greece (28, 42) and one each in Ireland (41) and Italy (40). A total of 1,510 cases of hepatitis A
were reported as part of outbreaks involving migrants, of which 1,322 (87.5%) occurred after
January 2015. Outbreaks affecting migrants were predominantly reported to be of sub-genotype
IB, similar to strains previously isolated from samples in the Middle East, Turkey, Pakistan and
East Africa (28, 34, 42), in contrast to recent European hepatitis A outbreaks in native
populations, where sub-genotype IA is often prevalent (34, 70-72).
Between September 2015 and March 2016, cases rose across Germany by 45% from what is to
be expected (34). This dramatic increase was due to an unusually high burden of disease in
migrants; of the 699 cases, 278 (40%) were in asylum seekers, 90% of which were of subgenotype IB. In 2016 and 2017, Greece reported 188 and 30 cases, respectively, of hepatitis A of
mainly sub-genotype IB in the childhood refugee population (28). The individuals affected were
mainly Syrian, with some Iraqi and Afghan nationals also reported as positive.
Rubella outbreaks in migrants
Three rubella outbreaks involving migrants were reported, all occurring in Spain (44, 61, 64, 65).
Overall, 487 cases of rubella were included, of which 277 (56.9%) were migrants. Across all
outbreaks, the migrants affected were predominantly Latin American, with two affecting only
this group (61, 64). Around a third of cases (151; 31.0%) were reported as being in women of
child-bearing age, of whom seven were pregnant and subsequently terminated their
pregnancies. In two outbreaks, all affected individuals reported being unvaccinated. In the
remaining outbreak, 94.3% (n=460) did not have evidence of rubella vaccination (65).

Mumps and other VPDs in migrants
Mumps outbreaks were reported in three studies (295 cases), including two distinct outbreaks
(39, 63) and one report that presented all outbreak-related cases in asylum seekers in Germany
from 2004 to 2014 (24). One outbreak in Spain across 17 municipalities of Almeria (63) caused
145 infections, of which a small number (4 cases) were migrants. Another outbreak in Norway
was reported as having a foreign student as the index case and went on to infect 148
individuals, resulting in seven hospitalisations and one case of meningitis (39).

Discussion
Our data highlight that migrants are an at-risk group involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe. We
have shown that adult and child migrants living in temporary shelters or camps are at particular
risk, alongside specific nationality groups. Measles, varicella and hepatitis A were responsible for
the largest burden of outbreak-related VPDs in migrants. A large majority of included varicella
outbreaks were associated with adults, whereas measles and hepatitis outbreaks affected a
wide range of age-groups. Half of included measles outbreaks were associated with migrants
from Eastern European countries, often of Roma ethnicity, with several outbreaks leading to
high numbers of hospitalisations, complications and deaths. Our data highlight the importance
of tailoring strategies for implementing catch-up vaccination to specific at-risk groups, alongside
the strengthening of routine data collection, in order to avoid outbreaks of vaccine-preventable
disease.
Measles, varicella and hepatitis A outbreaks were frequently reported from hosting facilities for
refugees and asylum seekers, making up almost half of all outbreaks included in this systematic
review. In these outbreaks, secondary cases among the local population were mostly limited,
but large numbers of migrants were often affected, for example, 351 migrants in a camp in
Calais during an outbreak of varicella (30). Since the large influx of migration in 2015, temporary
camps have become a new feature in Europe and the numbers of forced migrants residing in
such conditions continues to increase, with Greece alone hosting almost 40,000 migrants living
in temporary reception centres in 2020 (73). Many stay for extensive time periods in these
settlements, which often run well beyond capacity and in suboptimal conditions, including lack
of basic infrastructure and sanitation facilities. In most cases, migrants residing in temporary
camps are not included in national vaccination systems, which could mean children miss their
routine vaccinations. Poor sanitation makes these settlements highly conducive to outbreaks
such as hepatitis A, which can be spread through poor sanitation (5, 42). Despite this, limited
interventions exist in European countries to provide vaccination services to those living in
refugee camps, with NGOs often left to fill the gap (74).
Hepatitis A outbreaks among migrants were often associated with living conditions and
genetically unrelated to outbreaks in the general population, amongst whom MSM (men who
have sex with men) can be considered the main risk group (42). Varicella, which we have shown
often causes outbreaks amongst adults in temporary camps or detention centres, some of
whom required hospitalisation, is associated with more severe outcomes in adults (75). Whilst

most children born in Europe will have varicella at a young age and gain immunity, less than 60%
of adults from tropical countries have immunity through a varicella episode during childhood
(75, 76). Varicella is not part of routine vaccination schedules in most European countries;
however, our data suggests that the impact on communities living in refugee camps justifies the
implementation of organised vaccination in these settings. Provision of sanitary living conditions
and appropriate healthcare in refugee camps and detention centres, alongside universal
vaccination of residents for key diseases, such as measles, varicella and hepatitis A, are essential
to avoid further mortality. In 2014, a measles outbreak amongst young asylum seekers spread to
the wider population, causing a total of 1,344 cases and leading to 345 hospitalisations and the
death of a 1-year old child (37), demonstrating the potential consequences of neglecting at-risk
populations.
A key risk-factor for outbreaks is under-immunisation in the affected populations, with affected
migrant groups often having particularly low vaccine coverage. Numerous previous studies have
suggested migrants are an under-immunised group; we have shown in a previous systematic
review and meta-analysis that migrants represent an under-immunised population in the EU for
measles, mumps, diphtheria and tetanus (77). Another review has also suggested low immunity
coverage in migrants and refugees to the EU compared to the host population (2). A recent
study reported that the only factor associated with increased measles incidence is low vaccine
coverage, rather than migration itself; the study highlights the current low coverage of the
second vaccine dose (MCV2) in many Eastern European countries, in particular Romania
(coverage of 75%), a country which also has the highest measles incidence rate in the region
(46.1/100,000) (78). This reflects our findings that movement of under-immunised children from
Eastern Europe, mainly of Roma ethnicity, combined with pockets of under-immunisation in
host countries are a linking factor between outbreaks of measles. Roma communities are an
under-immunised group in a variety of settings in Europe and face many barriers to accessing
vaccination, including language, trust in health services, and concerns around vaccine safety (7982). Robust scientific messaging to address community-specific trust issues and circulating
misinformation has been highlighted as a key component of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out (11, 12).
It is crucial going forward that interventions are developed and tailored towards at-risk migrant
communities to build trust and reduce disparities in access to vaccination systems (83). Migrants
should have access to key vaccines regardless of their immigration status: the IOM has
specifically called for governments to ensure an adequate COVID-19 vaccine stock be reserved
for non-nationals and forcibly displaced migrants, regardless of their immigrations status (84).

Whilst our systematic review has brought to light several key at-risk populations groups for
specific diseases in Europe, the scope of the results is limited by the availability and quality of
the datasets that have been published. Despite including ten distinct VPDs in our search
strategy, only five diseases (measles, varicella, hepatitis A, rubella and mumps) returned any
reports that met our inclusion criteria. This may be due to a higher outbreak-causing potential
of these diseases compared to, for example, diphtheria, where isolated cases in migrants were
often reported but did not appear to spread (85-87). Few studies compare migrant incidence or
involvement in outbreaks with non-migrants, making it difficult to put these data into context
and determine which groups are most vulnerable. Differences in reporting systems between
European countries is inhibitory to the assimilation of accurate data on at-risk groups for VPD
outbreaks. It is of utmost importance that demographical data on outbreaks (including
nationality and migrant status) is collected and reported in a transparent and disaggregated
manner, for example, as part of the European Surveillance System (TESSy), as this can provide
insight into populations who may be at particular risk as well as health system or technological
weaknesses that may leave an area or population open to future outbreaks.
Recent ECDC guidelines (88) call on EU/EEA countries to offer vaccination against measles,
mumps and rubella (MMR) to all migrant children and adolescents as well as adults without
immunisation records, in accordance with the immunisation schedule of the host country. Adult
migrants should also be given a primary series of diphtheria, tetanus, and polio vaccines. We
have also shown in this systematic review the risks associated with lack of immunity to varicella
and hepatitis A, particularly in refugee camps, suggesting specific guidelines should also be
developed to cover these vaccinations for migrants. These data provide a clear rationale for
greater emphasis to be placed on developing effective and targeted strategies to improve
vaccine coverage in migrants as an at-risk group, particularly for adolescent or adult migrants
who will not be easily incorporated into host vaccination schedules on arrival. This will require
further research to better understand vaccine uptake and demand issues in migrant groups
(including confidence, convenience and complacency) and greater focus on co-designing vaccine
uptake strategies in close collaboration with affected communities, as well as commissioning of
health services and offering incentives for intervention development. Ensuring clinicians have
access to appropriate guidelines and heightened awareness of potential under-immunisation in
at-risk groups presenting is a vital next step in improving vaccine coverage and preventing
outbreaks and cases of preventable VPDs going forward. A specific focus needs to be placed on

catch-up vaccination for adults who may be excluded from routine immunisation schedules in
their host country, with an emphasis on community engagement to ensure acceptability. It is
also crucial that vaccination efforts in refugee camps, where poor living conditions leave many
at risk, are prioritised using NGOs or other groups who have already developed connections and
trust in these settings.

Panel: Key messages

Migrants are an at-risk group involved in VPD outbreaks in Europe and comprise one of
several under-immunised groups in the Region.
Adult and child migrants living in temporary shelters, camps or detention centres are at
high risk from VPD outbreaks, particularly of measles, varicella and hepatitis A.
At-risk groups varied by disease; a large majority of varicella outbreaks were associated
with adult migrants, whereas half of included measles outbreaks were associated with
migrants of all ages from Eastern European countries, often of Roma ethnicity.
Our data highlight the importance of tailoring vaccine-delivery strategies to specific atrisk migrant groups, and strengthening routine data systems to capture data on uptake
and coverage, in order to meet regional and global vaccination targets and avoid
outbreaks.
Migrants may face barriers to vaccination on arrival, including exclusion from vaccination
systems, with important implications for COVID-19 vaccine delivery going forward. A
better understanding of vaccine uptake and demand issues in migrant groups is urgently
needed, alongside a greater focus on co-designing vaccine uptake strategies in close
collaboration with affected migrant communities.
