Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the shortcomings in the deployment of state-of-the-art
diagnostic platforms. Although several PCR-based techniques have been rapidly developed to meet the
growing testing needs, such techniques often need samples collected through a swab, the use of RNA
extraction kits, and expensive thermocyclers in order to successfully perform the test. Isothermal
amplification-based approaches have also been recently demonstrated for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection by
minimizing sample preparation while also reducing the instrumentation and reaction complexity. There
are limited reports of saliva as the sample source and some of these indicate inferior sensitivity when
comparing RT-LAMP with PCR-based techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate an improved sensitivity
assay to test saliva using a 2-step RT-LAMP assay, where a short 10-minute RT step is performed with only
B3 and BIP primers before the final reaction. We show that while the 1-step RT-LAMP demonstrate
satisfactory results, the optimized 2-step approach allows for single molecule sensitivity per reaction and
performs significantly better than the 1-step RT-LAMP and conventional 2-step RT-LAMP approaches with
all primers included in the RT Step. Importantly, we demonstrate RNA extraction-free RT-LAMP based
assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from VTM and saliva clinical samples.

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has become
a major challenge for national health care systems, infecting millions of people, burdening daily life, and
causing heavy economic losses1,2. The fast spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the
shortcomings of the existing technologies and testing paradigm for viral diagnostics and has propelled the
need for alternate rapid and accurate diagnostic approaches for SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we await
the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, massive and repeated testing has been highlighted as a critical step to suppress
the spread3. However, due to the current cost of the test, the time required to obtain results, and other
logistical difficulties for massive deployment, there is further need for additional scientific improvements
for the deployment of testing solutions.
The current gold standard approaches for viral detection primarily relies on polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) but such assays often need extensive and time-consuming RNA purification steps and expensive
thermocyclers to successfully perform the test. These assays are also challenging to perform at the point
of care. Isothermal amplification techniques such Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)4 have
generating much interest especially to eliminate the need for precise thermal cycles to achieve the nucleic
acids amplification5. Likewise, LAMP has also shown to be robust against crude samples and inhibitors
that often slow PCR6,7. In addition, its use of 4-6 primers to identify 6-8 regions of a target genome for
amplification increases the specificity in comparison to PCR4,8. The robustness of the Bst polymerase and
Reverse Transcriptase enzymes allow direct detection of RNA targets from crude samples without any
RNA extraction or purification6,9. However, the sensitivity of these assays detecting RNA viruses has
remained low and to the best of our knowledge never reached single molecule detection limits10-12. In the
particular case of SARS-CoV-2, recent studies indicate that the sensitivity of RT-LAMP is inferior to that of
some PCR-based techniques for COVID-19 in saliva specimens13.
Besides the detection technique, the sample specimen is also critical when developing assays that could
be massively scaled or used for asymptomatic testing. Towards this end, although saliva is becoming a
preferred and scalable option for reliable and massive testing, very few of the EUA approved PCR-based
tests detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva specimens14 and to the best of our knowledge to the date
there are no saliva-to-RT-LAMP EUA approved tests. The use of saliva as sample has demonstrated not
only to serve as an alternative upper respiratory tract specimen type for SARSCoV-2 detection15-17, but
also saliva offers a number of advantages over nasopharyngeal (NP) and nasal swabs when considering
the aforementioned criteria for mass testing efforts. The use of NP swabs can cause discomfort and
irritation that could promote sneezing and coughing and increase the risk of exposure for the medical
providers18,19. Collection of NP swabs has been associated with variable, inconsistent, and false negative
test results17. On the other hand, saliva does not require a certified swab, specific collection receptacle,
or transport media, and does not have to be obtained by a skilled healthcare provider, all of which increase
diagnostic associated costs. Despite the interest generated and the mentioned advantages, only 3 papers
in the pre-print form20,21 or peer-reviewed13 have been reported regarding RT-LAMP detection of SARSCoV-2 RNA from saliva specimens. Although these papers highlight the possibility of bypassing the RNA
extraction step20,21, they note the limitation on sensitivity of traditional RT-LAMP when detecting SARSCoV-2 RNA from saliva. For instance, it is mentioned that RT-LAMP reaction was still not sufficiently
sensitive to detect fewer than 200 viral copies/μL in saliva and that significant modifications to the RTLAMP technique were needed to achieve the single-copy detection levels20. Also, an RT-LAMP colorimetric
assay enabled detection of ~ 100 viral genomes per reaction21, and in an study across 103 saliva
specimens, the RT-LAMP show only 70.9% of sensitivity and its sensitivity was behind of some PCR-based
techniques 13.
In this paper, we address the above limitations and present an optimized RT-LAMP approach for detecting
viral RNA with single molecule sensitivity from NP swabs (Viral Transport Media) and saliva specimens. By
adding a short 10-minute RT-incubation step with B3 and BIP primers specifically separated to improve

primer annealing with target, we increase the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP reaction by 2 orders of
magnitude over the current 1-step or 2-step RT-LAMP reactions. We first characterize our approach for
detection of Zika virus as an example, and quantitatively demonstrate the improvement in limit of
detection (LOD). We then use our optimized assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and inactivated
viruses in buffer to achieve single molecule sensitivity. Next, we show the robustness of our assay by doing
direct detection of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses in unprocessed VTM and saliva samples, bypassing the
RNA extraction step, with a detection limit down to 1 copy/L within 40 minutes, and with a sample to
result time of less than 1 hour. Finally, we tested our RT-LAMP reactions detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus in 50
VTM and 34 saliva clinical samples. It is important to note that our protocol gives superior sensitivity to
the conventional 2-step RT-LAMP protocol where reverse transcription (RT) is separately performed with
all primers followed by an amplification step22-24. We believe, with our improved LOD and simple RNA
extraction-free protocol, our approach will allow rapid scaling of testing and detection of cases which
might have been otherwise missed due to low viral loads.

Results
Improved RT-LAMP assay
For sensitive detection of viruses, we optimized the standard 1-step RT-LAMP process flow to include a
short incubation step for cDNA synthesis before the LAMP reaction. Figure 1 compares our optimized 2steps RT-LAMP protocol with the conventional 1-step RT-LAMP and 2-step RT-LAMP approaches. Our
improved RT-LAMP assay is a 2-step process that begins with thermally lysed viral samples (95 C, 10
minutes). We and others have recently shown that a short thermal lysis prior to RT-LAMP reaction
efficiently exposes the RNA for amplification and is also known to inactivate nucleases in crude
samples5,25. In our new protocol, post thermal lysis, we add LAMP buffer reagents, B3 and BIP LAMP
primers, and the thermophilic Reverse Transcriptase enzyme (RTx, NEB), and perform a 10-minute RT
incubation at 55 C. The reduced temperature for the RT step (55 C RT vs 65 C LAMP) allows for improved
annealing between the RNA and the primers and allows for efficient complementary strand synthesis.
Since LAMP requires the formation of loop structures for amplification through a defined sequence of
steps (binding and extension of inner primer, followed by binding and extension of outer primer), having
only B3 and BIP in the RT step reduces the possibility of mis-priming events26,27 and allows for improved
LOD which we characterize in the following sections. After the short RT incubation, the rest of the primers
(F3, FIP, LF and LB) and Bst polymerase are added, and the LAMP reaction is performed at a constant
temperature (65 C, 60 min.). It is important to note that our modified protocol involving a separate RT
step with only B3 and BIP primers offers superior sensitivity to the conventional 2-step RT-LAMP process
where RT incubation is performed with either random hexamers or all of the LAMP primers22-24.
Characterization with Zika RNA and virus
We characterized our optimized RT-LAMP assay by comparing the LODs of RT-LAMP assays with and
without the short RT incubation step using Zika genomic RNA as target. Figure S1a-c (supplementary
information) shows the amplification curves for the detection of Zika genomic RNA with: 1) our optimized
2-step reaction with a reverse transcriptase incubation (RT-incubation) step (55 C, 10 minute), where
only the B3 and BIP primers were added during the RT-incubation (all other primers were added for the
final reaction at 65 C) (Figure S1a); 2) in a 1-step RT-LAMP reaction (no intermediate incubation step)
(Figure S1b); and 3) in a 2-step reaction process with an intermediate RT-incubation at 55 C (10 min.) and
where all primers were added (Figure S1c). Figure S1d shows the threshold times plot for these reactions.
While in the case of the 1-step RT-LAMP reaction the LOD was 2x103 copies/L, in the traditional 2-step
RT-LAMP reaction the LOD improved to 2x102 copies/L with 2/3 amplifications for 2x101 copies/L.
However, when using our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction, the LOD was as low as 2 copies/L (2/3
replicates were amplified). This improved LOD is 3 orders of magnitude better than the detection limit of

a 1-step RT-LAMP reaction. Note that the limit of detection is determined by the expected sampling
frequency and as we approach single molecules, sampling bias can start to occur.
Then, we evaluated the efficiency of our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP assay to directly detect viruses using
Zika virus as the target. We serially diluted Zika viruses and spiked them in our reactions. Figure S1e-f
shows the amplification curves for the detection of Zika virus in a 1-step RT-LAMP reaction and in our
optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction. While in the 1-step RT-LAMP reaction the LOD was 4x102 copies/L
(only 1/3 amplifications for 4x101 copies/L), in the case of our optimized reaction the obtained LOD was
4x101 copies/L with all three replicates amplifying in less than 20 min. Figure S1g shows the threshold
times plot for these reactions. Though the detection limit of Zika virus did not reach 4 copies/L, we
observed 1 order of magnitude improvement in detection limit with our 2-step RT-LAMP process as well
as faster amplification timings for the 4x103 and 4x102 copies/L target concentrations.
Characterization with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and virus
We next evaluated our assay composition and protocol with SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and inactivated
viruses. Thus, we first confirmed the improved detection limit of our optimized RT-LAMP assay by
performing the 1-step and our modified 2-step reactions to detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. Figure S2ab shows the amplification curves for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in a 1-step RT-LAMP
reaction and in our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction. While in the 1-step RT-LAMP reaction the LOD
was 2x101 copies/L, we observed that our optimized 2-step assay allowed an improved LOD of 2
copies/L with all three replicates amplifying within 25 minutes. Figure S2c shows the threshold times
plot for these reactions. These results highlight that our optimized RT-LAMP assay is able to amplify 2
copies/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in starting sample.
Next, we compared the results between a 1-step RT-LAMP assay and our optimized 2-step assay for the
detection of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. The LOD was 1 copy/L using our optimized protocol with a
short RT-incubation and separated primers (Figure S2d-e). This is more than 1 order of magnitude
sensitive than the LOD of the 1-step RT-LAMP assay for SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Figure S2f shows the
threshold times plot for these reactions We further observed 3-5 minutes faster amplification timings for
the three highest concentrations of viral sample (4x103-4x101 copies/L) in the 2-step RT-LAMP process.
These results highlight that our optimized RT-LAMP assay can show single molecule sensitivity.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Viral Transport Media
Current diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 includes collecting nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal specimen
swabs with viruses and transferring them into viral transport media (VTM), from which the sample can be
collected, purified, and tested using a diagnostic assay28. To evaluate if the detection limit of viral samples
in VTM is improved by our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction, we spiked serial dilutions of inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 virus in VTM and performed both the usual 1-step and our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP
reactions. The amplification curves (Figure 2a-b) and threshold times (Figure 2c) show a detection limit of
1 copy/L for our optimized RT-LAMP assay in comparison to the LOD of 40 copies/L in the 1-step RTLAMP process. These results demonstrate no reduction in sensitivity of our assay in VTM compared to
viruses spiked in buffer. It also highlights the fact that for our assay sensitive detection is possible without
any RNA extraction. This pathway can allow potential integration in the current clinical workflow from
nasopharyngeal or nasal samples.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in spiked healthy human saliva
The use of saliva has been demonstrated as an alternative upper respiratory tract specimen type for SARSCoV-2 detection and also to offer advantages over the use of NP and nasal swabs. Thus, to evaluate our
optimized assay with unprocessed saliva samples, serial dilutions of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses were
spiked in purchases pooled human saliva (Innovative Research). The detection was performed using the

conventional 1-step as well as our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction. In the amplification curves (Figure
2d-e) and threshold times (Figure 2f), we observed that for the 1-step RT-LAMP reaction, a LOD of 4x102
copies/L virus in saliva was obtained (with 2/3 replicates amplifying for 4x101 copies/L). In contrast, in
our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP assay in saliva, all three replicates amplified for 4 copies/L and 1/3
replicates amplified for 1 copy/L. This highlights the single molecule sensitivity with which we can detect
SARS-CoV-2 viruses from unprocessed human saliva samples without any purification or extraction of
RNA. These results were again confirmed when repeating the experiments under the same conditions
(Figure S3).
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus from clinical samples
In order to demonstrate the applicability of our assay, we also characterized our optimized 2-step RTLAMP reaction using 50 VTM clinical samples (25 known positives and 25 known negatives) and 34 saliva
clinical samples (from in-patients at Carle Foundation Hospital). While for the analysis of the VTM samples
we used our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction (2 L sample + 14 L reaction mix), for the
characterization of our assay with saliva samples we compared our 2-step RT-LAMP reaction with the
conventional 1-step RT-LAMP reaction and also using two different reaction volumes to examine
differences in sampling. For saliva, we used the small volume format (2 L sample + 14 L reaction mix)
and also the large volume format (12 L sample + 84 L reaction mix) for both optimized 2-step and
traditional 1-step reactions. Thus, in the case of saliva, four different reactions were used to analyze each
of clinical samples. In addition to the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the quality of samples (both VTM
and saliva) was also tested by spiking an aliquot of the sample with MS2 bacteriophage (internal control).
Figure 3 summarize the samples, techniques, and volume formats used. Each clinical sample (both VTM
and saliva) was also tested using the RT-PCR assays from clinical lab results (gold standard), which included
the RNA purification step, and were used to compare our RT-LAMP results.
The VTM samples used in our work were obtained from Order of St. Francis (OSF) Healthcare (Peoria, IL)
through an approved institutional review board (OSF Peoria IRB # 1602513 through the University of
Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria with waiver for consent). The samples received were VTM discards
prior to the RNA purification step. Along with the samples, we also received the results of the RT-PCR tests
performed by OSF Healthcare. The results obtained using these VTM clinical samples are summarized in
Figure 4 (raw amplification data is in Figure S4). Our RNA extraction-free 2-step RT-LAMP reaction (small
volume) was able to detect as positives, 23 of 25 confirmed VTM positive samples, after a thermal lysis
step (95 C, 1 minutes). Likewise, this reaction was able to detect as negatives, 25 of 25 confirmed VTM
negative clinical samples. With these results, the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value
(NPV), sensitivity, and the specificity were calculated as 100%, 92.6%, 92%, and 100% respectively.
The saliva samples used in this work were obtained from COVID-19 in-patients at Carle Foundation
Hospital (Urbana, IL.) through an approved institutional review board (Carle IRB # 20CRU3150). Along with
the collection of the saliva clinical samples, nasal swab samples were also collected from the same subject
at Carle Foundation Hospital and analyzed by RT-PCR technique at Carle clinical lab. Immediately after
collection, the saliva samples were mixed with TE buffer (1:1). The use of TE buffer reduced the viscosity
of the sample, allowing for easier pipetting. The results obtained using these saliva clinical samples are
summarized in Figure 5 (amplification raw data and internal control results are in Figure S5).
Results demonstrate that our 2-step RT-LAMP reaction (large volume) offered the best results with 100%
of sensitivity when analyzing the 21 saliva samples that were confirmed positive with the RT-PCR results
from clinical laboratory from the nasal swab control samples. Interestingly, from the 13 saliva samples
confirmed negative, 3 where detected as positive with our method. Note that samples (both confirmed
positive and negative) are from patients admitted in the hospital who were diagnosed COVID-19 positive
by RT- PCR of nasal samples obtained within 14 days of the saliva sample collection date.

Discussion
Although nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal swabs have been recommended by the CDC as the
upper respiratory tract specimen types for SARS-CoV-2 viral testing28, saliva specimens have been an
appealing alternative to the swabs, as saliva samples can be collected non-invasively, and minimizes the
contact between healthcare workers and patients and the chance of exposure to the virus16,17. In previous
analysis of the concordance between nasopharyngeal and saliva samples for detection of SARS-CoV-2 and
other respiratory pathogens, it has been demonstrated that sensitivity between the two sample types are
highly comparable16,17,29,30. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus
without RNA extraction not only from VTM clinical samples but also from saliva clinical samples using the
optimized 2-step RT-LAMP protocol in the current clinical workflow. In addition, in the case of saliva, we
studied the role of the sampling volume in the assay sensitivity. For saliva clinical samples, we used the
small volume format (2 L sample + 14 L reaction mix) and also the large volume format (12 L sample
+ 84 L reaction mix) for both optimized 2-step and conventional 1-step RT-LAMP reactions.
The VTM patient samples used in this work were collected and stored frozen prior to the RNA purification
step at OSF Hospital (25 confirmed positive and 25 confirmed negative). The saliva samples used in this
work were obtained from in-patients for COVID-19 (21 confirmed positive and 13 confirmed negative). In
both cases, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed using RT-PCR technique from NP (for VTM)
and nasal swabs (for Saliva) as the control. First, we tested the VTM samples using our optimized 2-step
RT-LAMP approach with the small volume format (2 L sample + 14 L reaction mix) due to limited sample
amount available. The results (Figure 4) indicated a perfect agreement with the RT-PCR control when
testing the negative samples. However, from the 25 positive samples, 2 were detected as negatives with
our reaction in the small volume format. We believe this could be attributed to the fact that the
concentration in these samples was low and the RNA molecules was not sampled in the volume that we
analyzed. Results for PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated based on these results (VTM in
Figure 6a and Figure 6b). As shown in Figure 6a-b, our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP approach (small volume)
show 100% PPV and specificity. However, due to the 2 false negatives, NPV and sensitivity were 92.6%
and 92% respectively. Based on these results we decided to study the role of the sampling in the assay
sensitivity by including a large volume format when analyzing saliva samples.
We found that when using a larger saliva sample volume in the optimized 2-step RT-LAMP approach, we
obtained 100% sensitivity as we were able to detect as positives the 21 confirmed positives samples
(Figure 5a, saliva - before clinical adjudication - in Figure 6a, and Figure 6c). However, 3 of the confirmed
negative samples (# 23, 27, and 30) from the in-patients were detected as positives with our reaction
impacting the specificity results (76.9%) (Figure 5b). Similar behavior was obtained when using the
optimized 2-step RT-LAMP approach (small volume) and conventional 1-step RT-LAMP approach (large
volume) where samples 23, 27, and 30 were also detected as positives. However, in these cases the
sensitivity was worse as these reactions reported 4 and 3 false negatives, respectively. Finally, the
conventional 1-step RT-LAMP approach (small volume) reported the lowest sensitivity (76.2%) although
the specificity was a little bit better (84.6%) as only sample numbers 23 and 30 (not sample 27 in this case)
were detected as positives. Interestingly, since the patients were known to be COVID-19 positive from an
earlier test when admitted to the hospital due to symptoms, and were still in the hospital being treated
when the saliva sample and the control nasal swab sample was taken, it could be hypothesized that the
saliva samples depict the real presence of the viral RNA and the nasal swab does not. If samples 23, 27,
and 30 are considered positives (after clinical adjudication), then sensitivity and specificity change as
shown in Figure 6a, and Figure 6d. First, the total number of positives is now 24, while the total number
of negatives is now 10. The optimized 2-step RT-LAMP approach (large volume) indicates a perfect
agreement with the control (PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity = 100%). In addition, for all reaction
conditions studied, the specificity would be 100%. We can conclude that increasing the sample volume,

improve the reaction sensitivity, although this also increase the cost of the assay due to increase use in
reagents. Also, the use of the optimized 2-step approach improves the assay sensitivity in comparison
with the conventional 1-step reaction when the same volume of sample is used. An important point to
note is that the saliva samples can detect the presence of RNA in in-patient samples diagnosed of COVID19 when the nasal swabs were not.
The better performance of the optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction (large volume) is also highlighted in
the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (Figure 6c-d). With this reaction condition (after
clinical adjudication) the AUC was 1.00, showing that this reaction can correctly detect positive and
negative samples without false positives or false negatives. The saliva results and the study of the volume
sampling indicate that the optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction (small volume) can produce some false
negatives. This could explain the 2 false negatives we obtained when analyzing the VTM clinical samples.
It is important to highlight that although the sensitivity can vary with the different approaches used in this
study, the RT-LAMP reaction achieves 100% specificity when analyzing VTM and saliva samples,
independent of the assay conditions. This improved performance along with the high sensitivity of our
optimized 2-step RT-LAMP approach are very important features when considering the use of RT-LAMP
reactions for massive surveillance testing especially for portable and point of care applications5.

Methods
Zika and SARS-CoV-2 Genomic RNA and Viruses
We obtained ZIKV (PRVABC59) genomic RNA, NR-50244, and SARS-CoV-2 (Isolate USA-WA1/2020)
genomic RNA, NR-52285, from BEI Resources and stored them in -80 °C. Stock volumes of genomic RNA
were diluted to the correct concentrations in water. We also obtained whole viruses from BEI resources
for ZIKV (PRVABC59), NR-50240, as well as heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2, NR-52286. The stock vials were
aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until used for experimentation. To obtain the appropriate concentrations,
viruses were diluted in Tris-EDTA Buffer or VTM.
Primer Sequences and Primer Validation Reactions
The primer sequences for the Zika and SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP reactions used in this paper were obtained
from our previously published work5,9 and were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies.
Clinical samples
VTM clinical samples used are discarded viral transport medium prior to the RNA purification step from
25 samples from patients who were tested positive for COVID-19 and from 25 samples from patients who
were tested negative for COVID-19 at OSF Healthcare (Peoria, IL) by a RT-PCR test performed at OSF
Healthcare. The samples were received de-identified, frozen and were obtained through an approved
institutional review board (OSF Peoria IRB # 1602513 through the University of Illinois College of Medicine
with waiver for consent).
Saliva clinical samples were collected from 34 in-patients at Carle Foundation Hospital (Urbana, IL) who
were tested COVID-19 positive (RT-PCR) when they were admitted in the hospital (or at most 14 days
before admission) through an approved institutional review board (Carle IRB # 20CRU3150).
Simultaneously to the collection of the saliva clinical samples, nasal swab samples were also collected
from the same subject at Carle Foundation Hospital and analyzed by RT-PCR technique at Carle clinical
lab. Immediately after collection, the saliva samples were mixed with TE buffer (1:1). Samples were
received de-identified and either fresh (during the collection day) or frozen (the next day after the
collection day).

The following components comprised the RT-LAMP assay: 4 mM of MgSO4 (New England Biolabs), 1× final
concentration of the isothermal amplification buffer (New England Biolabs), 1.025 mM each of
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, and 0.29 M Betaine (Sigma-Aldrich). Individual stock components
were stored according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and a final mix including all of the components
was freshly created prior to each reaction. Along with the buffer components, a primer mix consisting of
0.15 μM F3 and B3, 1.17 μM forward Inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP), and 0.59 μM of
LoopF and LoopB was added to the reaction. Finally, 0.47 U/μL BST 2.0 WarmStart DNA Polymerase (New
England Bioloabs), 0.3 U/μL WarmStart Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs), 1 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin (New England Biolabs), and 0.735× EvaGreen (Biotium) were included in the reaction.
EvaGreen dye is a double- stranded DNA intercalating dye. After addition of the template, the final volume
of the reaction was 16 μL (small volume format) or 96 μL (large volume format). In the case of the small
volume format, the volume of the template/sample was 2 μL, while in the case of the large volume format,
the volume of the template/sample was 12 μL.
All RT-LAMP assays were carried out in 0.2 mL PCR tubes in an Eppendorf Mastercycler realplex Real-Time
PCR System at 65 °C (60 min). Fluorescence data were recorded every 1 min. after each cycle of the
reaction. While all characterization experiments were performed with number of replicates n = 3, n = 4
was used for the analysis of clinical samples.
For the 1-step RT-LAMP reactions without incubation, the first step was to serially dilute genomic RNA or
viruses in H2O and aliquot 2 or 12 L sample of the correct concentration into PCR tubes. Samples with
viruses were thermally lysed (95 C, 1 min.). Finally, 14 or 84 L of RT-LAMP reagents were added with
final concentrations as mentioned above, and the final reactions were incubated in the thermocycler for
amplification.
For the 2-step RT-LAMP reactions with RT-incubation, the first step was to perform serial dilutions of the
RNA or viral sample as mentioned in the 1-step protocol and to aliquot 2 or 12 L sample of the correct
concentration into PCR tubes. Only samples spiked with viruses were lysed (95˚C, 1 min.) in a heater. Post
thermal lysis, we added 3.28 L (small volume format) of a buffer mix with B3 and BIP primers as well as
reverse transcriptase enzyme and incubated the reaction tubes in a heater for 10 minutes at 55 °C (RTincubation step). In this step, BIP and B3 primers anneal to the target and begin cDNA synthesis, without
competition from other primers, reducing primer dimers. Post RT-incubation, 10.71 L (small volume
format) of the rest of the reagents for RT-LAMP were mixed in the reaction tubes and final reactions were
incubated in the thermocycler for amplification. Final concentrations of all reagents in the two-step RTLAMP assay were the same as mentioned above.
All RT-LAMP reactions consisted were performed with at least one set of non-template negative controls.
SARS-CoV-2 Genomic RNA and Virus Detection in RT-LAMP Reactions
Reactions done with heat-inactivated viruses and clinical samples included a thermal lysis step. Heatinactivated viruses were serially diluted in TE Buffer and then thermally lysed in a heater at 95 °C (1 min)
prior to their addition into the final reaction mix. VTM clinical samples were thermally lysed in a heater at
95 °C (1 min) prior to their addition into the final reaction mix, while in the case of saliva clinical samples
the thermal lysis step lasted 10 min. After heat lysis, the tubes were centrifuged (2000 g, 1 min.) and then
kept in 4 °C (5 min.).
In the first analysis of VTM clinical samples we noticed that samples # 15, 18, 22, and 25 did not show
amplification. Likewise, internal controls from samples # 21, 24, and 25 did not show amplification either.
During processing we noticed that these samples were highly viscous and contained debris, which may
have prevented amplification. We repeated the analysis of these samples but added a 5 min centrifugation
step (4000 g). This additional centrifugation allowed separation of the debris and viscous components
from the viral particles. The amplification reaction these samples was repeated using the supernatant post

centrifugation. After the second analysis, internal controls from samples # 21, 24, and 25 did show
amplification while from the VTM clinical samples only samples # 15 and 25 did show amplification.
Results in Figure 4, Figure 6a-b, and Figure S4 report the second analysis of these samples.
VTM used for assay characterization was obtained from Redoxica (VTM-500ML), aliquoted, and stored in
4 °C away from direct light. Saliva used for assay characterization was pooled human saliva obtained from
Innovative Research (IRHUSL5ML) and aliquoted and stored in -20 C until use for the reactions. The
pooled material was collected from donors prior to December 2019.
Serial dilutions of heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses were done in VTM to concentrations ranging from
4x103 copies/L to 1 copy/L in the starting sample. The samples were aliquoted into PCR tubes and lysed
(95 C, 1 min.) prior to adding RT-LAMP reaction mix. For our optimized 2-step protocol, the B3 and BIP
primers and RT enzyme were added for the RT-incubation step (55°C, 10 min.). Remaining RT-LAMP
reagents including F3, FIP and Loop primers were added for a final reaction volume of 16 L. The
amplification reaction was performed at 65°C for 60 min.
Reactions done with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses in saliva were in the same formats as mentioned
above for the 1-step and our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP assays. Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses were
serially diluted and directly spiked in saliva to starting sample concentrations ranging between 4x103
copies/L to 1 copy/L. The samples were aliquoted into PCR tubes and thermally lysed at 95C for 1
minute prior to adding the RT-LAMP reaction reagents. In our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP assay, 7.85 L of
RT reaction volume including the B3, BIP primers, RT enzyme, and buffer were added to 2 l of sample for
the RT-incubation step (55°C, 10 min). Remaining RT-LAMP reagents (6.15 L) were added post RT step,
for a final reaction volume of 16 L. The amplification reaction was done in a thermocycler (65°C, 60 min.).
Prior to the thermal lysis step, the clinical samples (VTM and saliva) were aliquoted in two portions. One
aliquot was used for internal control and therefore spiked with MS2 bacteriophage (ZeptoMetrix
Corporation) in a 1:9 ratio (MS2:sample).
Amplification Data Analysis
The RT-LAMP fluorescence curves and amplification threshold bar graphs were analyzed using a MATLAB
script and plotted using GraphPad Prism 8. For each curve, the threshold time was taken as the time
required for each curve to reach 20% of the total intensity. The amplification threshold bar graphs show
the mean and SD of three samples for characterization experiments and the mean and SD of four samples
for clinical samples analysis.
ROC analysis was performed on GraphPad Prism 8.
PPV = (Number of true positives)/(Number of true positives + Number of false positives).
NPV = (Number of true negatives)/(Number of true negatives + Number of false negatives).
Sensitivity = (Number of true positives)/(Number of true positives + Number of false negatives).
Specificity = (Number of true negatives)/(Number of true negatives + Number of false positives).

Figure 3|VTM and saliva samples collection and pathways of analysis. VTM samples (NP swab collection)
were analyzed using our optimized 2-step RT-LAMP reaction (2 L sample + 14 L reaction mix) and RTPCR gold standard technique (control). Saliva samples and nasal swab (collected from the same subject)
were analyzed using RT-LAMP and RT-PCR (control) techniques respectively. For the RT-LAMP technique
we compared our 2-step RT-LAMP reaction with the conventional 1-step RT-LAMP reaction using the small
volume (2 L sample + 14 L reaction mix) and the large volume (12 L sample + 84 L reaction mix)
formats. In the case of RT-LAMP techniques, for both VTM and saliva, the quality of samples was also
tested by spiking an aliquot of the sample with MS2 bacteriophage (internal control).
