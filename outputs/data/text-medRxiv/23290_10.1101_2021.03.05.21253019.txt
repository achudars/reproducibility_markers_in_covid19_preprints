Abstract
We reviewed publicly available data from major U.S. health jurisdictions to compare case
fatality rates in people experiencing homelessness (PEH) to the general population. Case fatality
among PEH was 1.3 times (95% CI 1.1, 1.5) that of the general population, suggesting that PEH
should be prioritized for vaccination.

Introduction
People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to numerous
factors including increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection. Lacking permanent
shelter, PEH are less able to mitigate exposures through social distancing, often living doubled
up in the homes of friends and family, in crowded shelter facilities, or in densely populated
encampments. Recommended strategies to prevent infection may be challenging for PEH:
access to high-quality masks may be limited and inconsistent access to running water makes
hand hygiene challenging. Through the course of the pandemic, health authorities have
reported high seroprevalence among PEH1 and large outbreaks at homeless shelters and
encampments.2–5 Relatedly, research has linked evictions to community-level COVID-19 risk.6,7
Once infected, PEH may be at elevated risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Homelessness
takes a dramatic toll on health. Researchers have estimated life expectancies among the
chronically homeless to be as low as 42-52 years.8 Weathering homelessness means that PEH
develop age-related health problems decades earlier than their housed counterparts.9,10 Many
of these conditions may increase risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19. For example,
the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among PEH may be two to three times
that of the general population.10–12 Based on this underlying risk, a modeling study projected
that 4% of the U.S. homeless population would require hospitalization due to COVID-19
infections and that nearly 1% would die.13

Despite substantial vulnerability to COVID-19 among PEH, few data exist to gauge the impact of
homelessness on COVID-19 outcomes. We therefore reviewed publicly available data in U.S.
health jurisdictions to compare case fatality rates among PEH to population-wide case fatality
rates.

Methods
We systematically searched for PEH-specific COVID-19 case and mortality data on websites
from public health agencies with jurisdiction over the 25 most populous U.S. counties (n=25),
the 25 most populous U.S. cities (n=12 additional), and the most populous city in each state
(n=39 additional). Data were collected from February 19th – 28th, 2021.
If PEH-specific counts were available, we extracted the most recent cumulative case and death
counts for PEH, as well as jurisdiction-wide case and death counts. Where possible, we also
extracted data by demographic factors such as age.
For each jurisdiction, we calculated PEH case fatality rates (CFRs, defined as deaths per 100
cases) and jurisdiction-wide CFRs, and compared these via relative risk (a ratio of PEH CFR over
jurisdiction-wide CFR). We then summarized CFRs and relative risk estimates across all
jurisdictions as a population-weighted average. If a jurisdiction published age-stratified PEH
case and death counts, we calculated age-specific CFRs and relative risk.

Results
Of the 76 jurisdictions reviewed, 7 (9.2%) with data on PEH were included. In these
jurisdictions, the CFR for PEH ranged from 0.3% to 4.8%, compared to jurisdiction-wide CFRs
that ranged from 0.6% to 2.5% (Figure 1a, relative risks ranging from 0.3 to 2.2). Across
jurisdictions, the overall CFR was 2.1% (95% CI 1.8, 2.3) among PEH and 1.6% (CI 1.6, 1.6) for
the general population (relative risk 1.3 (CI 1.1, 1.5)).
Only Los Angeles County stratified PEH data by additional demographic characteristics. We
compared age-specific CFRs between PEH and the county population (Figure 1b), and found
CFRs were significantly increased for PEH under 65 compared to the county population, with
relative risks of 13.7 (95% CI 6.0, 31.1), 4.6 (3.3, 6.3), and 1.9 (1.5, 2.4) for 18-29, 30-49, and 5064 year-olds, respectively. Among adults aged 65 and over, this trend was reversed, with a
relative risk of 0.5 (0.4, 0.7).

Discussion
Our review identified few jurisdictions with publicly available information on COVID-19 cases
and mortality among PEH; however, the available data reveal significantly elevated overall and

age-specific COVID-19 mortality among PEH compared to the overall population. Individuals
identified as experiencing homelessness at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis had a 30% higher
risk of death than the overall population, underscoring the need to prioritize PEH for COVID-19
prevention interventions, including vaccination. Because this increased risk was especially
pronounced in younger age groups, age-based vaccine eligibility criteria may be inappropriate
for this medically vulnerable population.
Expanding vaccination eligibility to all PEH, regardless of age or presence of comorbidities,
would prevent COVID-19 mortality, while also streamlining vaccine distribution. The CDC
prioritized residents of long-term care facilities in Phase 1A of vaccine distribution because
congregate living and medical vulnerability placed residents at increased risk of COVID-19
infection and death, respectively.14 The same reasoning applies to PEH. Location-based
eligibility would enable jurisdictions to more efficiently leverage homeless outreach and
healthcare personnel. For example, vaccinating all consenting adults at one shelter or
encampment and then moving to the next reduces need for repeat visits to deliver vaccine to
only a small portion of eligible individuals at a time.
We found substantial heterogeneity in case fatality and CFR ratios across jurisdictions, likely
reflecting local differences in COVID-19 dynamics, surveillance and testing practices, homeless
services, and reporting. Careful evaluation of local COVID-19 prevention and control programs
is important to identify effective strategies to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in PEH.
Interestingly, we found that PEH cases over 65 years had a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality
than cases in Los Angeles’ overall over-65 population. The most likely explanation for this
finding is survivor bias: on average, PEH who survive to age 65 without shelter may be less frail
than older adults in the general population. Given low life expectancy among PEH,8 we also
hypothesize differing age distributions within this stratum, with fewer PEH aged 80 and over.
Importantly, however, older PEH remained at substantially elevated mortality risk compared
with younger PEH.
There are several limitations to our study. Because so few jurisdictions published PEH-specific
data, the generalizability of our estimates may be limited. Since available PEH data were rarely
disaggregated, we were not able to account for underlying differences such as age structure in
our comparisons of PEH versus jurisdiction-wide cases. Additionally, PEH status is prone to
misclassification and differential classification across jurisdictions. Specifically, we expect that
PEH not accessing homeless services would be misclassified as not PEH. Furthermore, COVID-19
screening programs by homeless services and health departments may increase detection of
mild COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among PEH compared with the
general population. Importantly, exposure misclassification and differential surveillance would
likely lead to underestimation of the degree to which homelessness increases COVID-19 case
fatality, strengthening our conclusion that PEH are a highly vulnerable population in need of
effective interventions to prevent COVID-19.
The paucity of COVID-19 data specific to PEH represents a limitation not just for our study, but
for public health surveillance as a whole. Disaggregated data allow for development of targeted

public health interventions that prioritize high-risk populations for case finding and vaccination.
Moreover, these data allow for monitoring of health inequities, documenting the degree to
which PEH are disproportionately burdened by COVID-19. Moving forward, it is essential that
data on homelessness be made available to understand the degree to which structural failures
such as insufficient housing have compromised U.S. pandemic preparedness. Routinely
collecting housing status as part of disease surveillance may pose logistical challenges in some
jurisdictions, as clinics, testing sites, laboratories, and coroners would need to coordinate
carefully. Nonetheless, we see this as an important step for the control of COVID-19 and other
infectious diseases in this high risk and underserved population.
As COVID-19 vaccines bring new signs of hope, we urge public agencies to prioritize PEH for
vaccination. Past outbreaks and seroprevalence studies have shown that exposure and
infection risk are extremely high among PEH. Our analyses suggest that COVID-19 may also be
particularly deadly for this population, independent of age. Vaccinating PEH has the potential to
prevent deaths, promote health equity, and reduce community transmission of COVID-19 in
many of the country’s hardest hit cities.15
