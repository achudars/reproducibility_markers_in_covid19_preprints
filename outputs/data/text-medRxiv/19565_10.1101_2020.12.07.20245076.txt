Abstract
Background:
This paper analyses any possible association of various factors like gender, last
COVID-19 PCR test results, BCG Vaccination, Seasonal Flu vaccination, Occupation and confirmed
case contact history with COVID-19 RDT results of the participants. COVID-19 will soon become
endemic in Pakistan, the government should adopt COVID-19 RDT kits for trace, test and quarantine
activities.

Methodology:
Considering the availability of COVI-19 rapid diagnostic kits, 596 individuals all previously
COVID-19 PCR tested were made part of this cross sectional study. Simple random sampling was used
for the selection of study participants. The whole study was conducted during September and October
2020.

Results:
The major findings of this study is clearly showing that the Positive Likely hood ratio of the
COVID-19 RDT Kits (LR+) is well above 1; similarly the Negative Likely hood ratio is approaching
0.On the other hand the Sensitivity and Specificity 80% and 74% respectively .Similarly study found
statistically significant association was between RDT out comes and Last PCR Test status, Occupation
and Contact with COVID-19 positive individuals. While other variables like Gender, BCG Vaccination
and history of seasonal flu vaccinations were found to have no significant associations with COVID-19
RDT Kit out comes.

Back Ground:
The COVID-19 infections are characterized by highly nonspecific manifestations including respiratory
symptoms, fever, cough, difficulty in breathing. These symptoms are also seen as clinical presentations
of other virus-related diseases including influenza [1,2]. This poses a challenge in identifying those
patients with COVID-19 from individuals with other respiratory diseases. Therefore, there is a need for
a diagnostic test that is rapid, accurate and cost efficient that may be used at point-of-care to screen and
confirm suspected cases. Early case detection has been proven to have a dramatic effect in controlling
infectious disease outbreaks [3]. The current, WHO-recommended gold standard for the diagnosis of
COVID-19 is the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid via reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR is reported to have a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity
of 100%; for every 100 COVID-19 positive patients, RT-PCR would have a falsely negative result in 5
patients [4]. The test, however, has limitations such as long turnaround times and complicated logistical
operations that makes it infeasible as a rapid and simple field test option to screen and diagnose patients.
Another proposed rapid, simple, and highly sensitive way to diagnose COVID-19 is through the
qualitative detection of antibodies that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 instead of the direct detection and
measurement of viral load through RT-PCR. Several studies have investigated the use of antibodies in
the diagnosis of COVID-19 using ELISA [5, 6, 7] and lateral flow rapid test kits [8,9]. These studies
show different sensitivity and specificity results, and different recommended timing of testing.
Disparities between ELISA and lateral flow rapid test results may be due to the longer incubation time
for ELISA compared to swift resolution for lateral flow tests, the slow kinetic dissociation rate of
ELISA compared to a faster kinetic association rate in lateral flow tests, and the ELISA “capture”
antibody and “detector” antibody designations may be reversed in lateral flow tests [10]. Thus, results
from studies using ELISA and lateral flow tests should be analyzed separately.
A rapid point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay test product was developed intended for qualitative
detection of IgM/IgG in human blood within 15 minutes. It has been designed to be a complementary
aid in the diagnosis of patients suspected to have the COVID-19 infection. Limitations of the test
include the following: 1) it does not directly confirm virus presence, instead, it provides serological
evidence of recent infection, 2) it is not known if the test will cross-react with antibodies to other

coronaviruses and flu viruses [8]. Further, studies in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS), a disease also caused by a coronavirus, show that IgM is detectable as early as 3 to 6 days from
symptom onset, while IgG is detectable after 8 days, with peak titers at 15 to 20 days [9,11]. This
potentially limits the clinical and public health utility of antibody tests for the early diagnosis of
coronavirus infections. Clinical trials that investigate the accuracy and safety of IgM/IgG rapid test kits
for diagnosis of COVID-19 patients are still limited.

Literature Review:
This rapid review summarizes the available evidence on the accuracy and safety of lateral flow
immunoassay (LFIA) IgM/IgG rapid test kits in diagnosing patients with COVID-19. Evidence on the
accuracy and safety of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for COVID-19 are
summarized in a separate rapid review.
Population: Symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and suspected COVID19 patients of
any age, with any comorbidities, any severity
Intervention: Antibody/Antigen test, IgM/IgG rapid test kit
Comparator: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Outcomes: Sensitivity, Specificity, Time to detection of antibodies
Methods: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized studies, cohort studies, casecontrol studies, cross-sectional studies.
After comprehensive search and appraisal, two (2) completed studies (Appendix 1) and one (1) ongoing
trial (Appendix 2) on the accuracy of IgM/IgG antibody test kits for diagnosing COVID-19 were
identified.Li et al., examined 525 blood samples of clinically positive (including PCR test) (n = 397) and
clinically negative(n=128)patients to determine these sensitivity and specificity of the IgM /IgG rapid test
kit [8].On the other hand,Yingetal.,investigated179 patients who were PCR positive (n=90) And PCR
negative (n=89) comparing the over-all sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test kit and when done
between day 0-7,day8-15, or day16 and beyond [9].In both studies, apositive test result was defined as
detection of either or both IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. A negative test result was defined as
non-detection of any or both IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS- CoV-2 [8,9].The ongoing trial
(NCT04316728) is designed to evaluate the clinical performance of IgM/IgG antibody test kits in the
early diagnosis of COVID-19inhighriskpopulations.The study will serially test uninfected health-care
workers and individuals with chronic conditions (n=200)and is expected to complete data collection by
September2020.

Critical Appraisal
Two studies provided direct evidence on the accuracy of lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)IgM/IgG rapid
test kits in diagnosing COVID-19 compared with PCR and clinical picture as the reference standard. Both
studies did not adequately describe the methods used to validate the accuracy of the test kits. As such, it is
difficult to ascertain whether or not safeguards to ensure a good estimate of the test kit’s diagnostic
accuracy were in place; the absence of these safeguards would tend to result in an overestimate of the test
kit’s diagnostic accuracy. As such, the results of these two studies need to be interpreted with caution.

Accuracy Outcomes
The overall accuracy of the rapid test from the two identified studies are summarized below.

In majority of cases, Li et al was not able to determine the number of days from symptom onset to the
time the blood sample for the rapid test was collected. However, in a subset of patients from one
institution (n=58), the blood samples were collected at day 8 to 33 after symptom onset [8].
Ying et al reported the time from onset of illness to blood sample collection in 115 patients. The accuracy
of the rapid test kit, stratified according to number of days of onset, is summarized below. The sensitivity
(18.8%) of the rapid test was extremely low among those who had their blood samples collected within
the first week of symptom onset [9].

Safety Outcomes
No adverse events were reported among the studies reviewed.

Problem Statement:
COVID 19 is a new disease not much is known about it and it would soon become endemic in Pakistan.
Till 30th August 2020, 1215 confirmed cases have been reported and local transmission is on its peak
with 7 infected districts in Balochistan. The current cases of COVID-19 are iceberg of diseases, there
may be many more cases in community.

Rationale:
The present standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 is through qualitative detection of COVID19 virus
nucleic acid via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Due to long turnaround
times and complicated logistical operations, a rapid and simple field test alternative is needed to
diagnose and screen patients. There is delayed in results due to limited RT PCR Laboratory in
Balochistan Province and its limited capacity to carry out daily PCR test. Even it was observed that
results are declared after death of Positive case. As compared to RT-PCR, RDT is simple, cost effective
and timely test to be conducted in field. As, Novel nature of disease, antibodies studies are conducted on
limited level throughout Pakistan. Study is justifiable because so far no published study has ascertained
the association of various known factors with immunity status using COVID-19 RDT results among
suspected, confirmed and exposed individuals so that in the long run Possible COVID-19 exposure and
encounter event could be made from individual’s history while performing Trace, test and Quarantine
(TTQ) activities in the field till the development of a vaccine.

Research Questions:
Q: Is there any association between COVID-19 RDT out-comes and certain variable of interest like
Gender, Last COVID-19 PCR results, BCG Vaccination, Seasonal Flu vaccination, Occupation and
Close contact or living with confirmed case of COVID-19 in last 15-45 days ?

Q: Is COVID-19 RDT Kits suitable for diagnostic Purposes?

Objectives:
1. To ascertained the association of various known factors with immunity developed against
COVID-19 using serological COVID-19 RDT for suspected, confirmed and exposed individuals.

2. To determine the Positive and Negative Likely hood Ratios for the COVID-19 RDT kits.

3. To ascertain clinical history based positive COVID-19 cases in the field while performing Test,
Trace and Quarantine (TTQ) activities in the field till the development of a vaccine.

Hypothesis:
H10: COVID-19 Serological Rapid Diagnostic test outcome has no association with Gender,
Last COVID-19 PCR report, BCG vaccination, Seasonal flue vaccination, Occupation and
Close contact or living history with confirmed case of COVID-19 in last 15-45 days.

H1a: COVID-19 Serological Rapid Diagnostic test outcome has association with Gender, Last
COVID-19 PCR report, BCG vaccination, Seasonal flue vaccination, Occupation and Close
contact or living history with confirmed case of COVID-19 in last 15-45 days.

H20: There exists no association between COVID-19 RDT Kits out comes and COVID-19
Diagnosis.

H2a: There exists an association between COVID-19 RDT Kits out comes and COVID-19
Diagnosis.

Research Methodology:
A Cross-sectional study was performed, considering the availability of COVID19 Rapid Diagnostic test kits a total of 596 individuals were included in this study. All of these
participants were selected by Simple random sampling after acquiring the “Complete name list” of all
the individuals whom had done their PCR lab test in Fatimah Jinnah Chest Hospital Quetta. The study
setting was District Quetta Balochistan,the whole population of Balochistan was considered as sample
population. Every individual of any age and gender belonging to any district of Balochistan who had done his or her
COVID-19 PCR test at PCR Lab Fatimah Jinnah Chest hospital Quetta from 1st January 2020 till 30th August 2020 were
included in the study regardless of their PCR test reports. Prior to data collection Ethical review board at

Director General Health Services Balochistan was approached for the approval. Informed consents were
acquired from each participant after briefing them. Data collection was done through interviews using
structured questioner. Later on at the end of each interview a single fresh blood drop was acquired from
every individual for COVID-19 Rapid Diagnostic test. The whole study was conducted during
September and October 2020.
Descriptive statistics was used for age, sex, occupation, educations status, &
Blood groups of the study participants while inferential statistics like Chi-square was used to assess
various associations. SPSS Software -19 versions was used to analyze the data. Similarly Positive and
Negative Likely hood ratios calculated using 2x2 table.

It is clear from the analysis that the Positive Likely hood ratio LR+ is more than 1, while Negative
Likely hood ratio is approaching 0. Hence COVID-19 RDT Kits could be used for diagnostic purposes
in all Clinical and Screening setup and especially for Test trace and Quarantine (TTQ) activities.

Discussion:
The major findings of this study are almost in line with the set hypothesis and objectives of
this study, this study is clearly showing that the Positive Likely hood ratio of the COVID-19 RDT Kits
(LR+) is well above 1; similarly the Negative Likely hood ratio is approaching 0.On the other hand the
Sensitivity and Specificity 80% and 74% respectively .Similarly study found statistically significant
association was between RDT out comes and Last PCR Test status, Occupation and Contact with
COVID-19 positive individuals. While other variables like Gender, BCG Vaccination and history of
seasonal flu vaccinations were found to have no significant associations with COVID-19 RDT Kit out
comes.
The results from this study seems to be consistent with previous studies like in his study Li
et al was able to report COVID-19 RDT kits sensitivity as 88.7% , specificity as 90.6%,LR+ = ratio as
9.46 while LR- = ratio as 0.13(8). In another study Ying et al has reported sensitivity to be
85.6%,Specificity as 91.0%,LR+ = 9.52 and LR- = 0.16(9). Which in comparison to this our study has
reported _ sensitivity 80%, specificity of 74% respectively while LR+ = 3.07 and LR- = 0.28. All the
findings of our study are almost identical. It can be clearly seen that in all three studies COVID-19 RDT
Kits (LR+) is well above 1; similarly the Negative Likely hood ratio is approaching 0.
Conclusion:
Being the first study of its kind in Pakistan the major findings of this study are almost in line
with the set hypothesis and objectives of this study and based on study findings it will be of high value to
use COVID-19 RDT kits during mass screening especially during Test, Trace and Quarantine activities.
These kits are reliable, cheap, easy to use and quick to produce results. With such promising likely hood
ratios it will be convenient to use these kits for bed site diagnosis of COVID-19.
