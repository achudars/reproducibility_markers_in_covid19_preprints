Abstract

2
3

Background: Changes in the prevalence of mental health problems among smokers due to

4

the COVID-19 pandemic in England have important implications for existing health

5

inequalities. This study examined the prevalence of psychological distress among smokers

6

following the onset of the pandemic compared with previous years.

7
8

Methods: Cross-sectional data were used from a representative survey of smokers (18+) in

9

England (n = 2,927) during four months (April to July) in 2016, 2017 and 2020. Adjusted

10

logistic regressions estimated the associations between past-month psychological distress

11

across two time periods (2016/17 and 2020), and age. Weighted proportions, chi-squared

12

statistics and stratified logistic regression models were used to compare the distributions of

13

minimal, moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-demographic and smoking

14

characteristic categories in 2016/17 and 2020.

15
16

Results: The prevalence of moderate and severe distress among past-year smokers was

17

higher in 2020 (moderate: 28.79%, 95%CI 26.11-31.60; OR=2.08, 95%CI 1.34-3.25; severe:

18

11.04%, 9.30-13.12; OR=2.16, 1.13-4.07) than in 2016/17 (moderate: 20.66%, 19.02-22.43;

19

severe: 8.23%, 7.16-9.47). While there was no overall evidence of an interaction between

20

time period and age, young (16-24 years) and middle-age groups (45-54 years) may have

21

experienced greater increases in moderate and older age groups (65+ years) in severe distress

22

from 2016/17 to 2020. There were also increases in 2020 of moderate distress among those

23

from more disadvantaged social grades and of both moderate and severe distress among

24

women and those with low cigarette addiction.

Conclusions: Between April-July 2016/17 and April-July 2020 in England there were

2

increases in both moderate and severe distress among smokers. The distribution of distress

3

differed between 2016/17 and 2020 and represents a widening of established inequalities,

4

with increases in distress among socio-economically disadvantaged groups, women and

5

diverging age groups.

What this paper adds
•

Surveys in the UK indicate that there has been a deterioration in mental health of
the general population since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

•

Smoking is strongly associated with poor mental health, and a deterioration in
mental health among smokers has potentially damaging consequences for existing
health inequalities in the UK.

•

Our findings using data from a large population-based sample of adults in England
show that between 2016/17 and 2020 there were increases in moderate and severe
psychological distress among smokers.

INTRODUCTION

2
3

Between 2014 and 2015 the prevalence of adult smoking in England was estimated to be

4

16.4%.1 Across the same period smoking prevalence was higher among those with anxiety or

5

depression (28.0%), a long-term mental health condition (34.0%) and serious mental illness

6

(40.5%).1 Those with a mental health condition are more likely to be more dependent

7

smokers and to have greater difficulty in remaining abstinent after quitting, despite greater

8

desire to quit compared with the general population.2 These differences in smoking may

9

account for up to two thirds of the inequality in life expectancy between those living with and

10

without a mental health condition.3 This study aimed to examine the prevalence of distress

11

among smokers following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in England compared with

12

previous years.

13
14

Serious psychological distress is defined as mental health problems that are associated with

15

impairment in social or occupational functioning and require treatment.4 Psychological

16

distress is more common among smokers and is negatively associated with quit success and

17

abstinence.5,6 The relationship between smoking and distress may be explained by common

18

risk factors related to socio-economic position7, but research also suggests potential

19

bidirectionality8. Individuals may be motivated to smoke to alleviate symptoms of distress,

20

and there is evidence that smoking may itself directly increase the risk of distress.9,10

21
22

Between 2016-2017 in England, 24.3% and 9.7% of past-year smokers indicated moderate

23

and serious past-month distress, respectively.11 Also, those with an indication of a mental

24

health problem were more dependent on cigarettes but more likely to be motivated and have

25

recently attempted to quit.

1

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government ‘lockdown’ measures were associated

2

with a deterioration of mental health in the UK compared with pre-COVID-19 trends, with

3

specific burden among women and young adults.12,13–15 Research has suggested that

4

following the March 2020 government restrictions, smokers were more likely to try and quit,

5

and rates of smoking cessation were higher.16 However, a deterioration in mental health

6

among smokers may negatively impact quitting behaviour given that smokers with distress

7

have been found to be less likely to quit and remain abstinent.5,6

8
9

Our previous research has highlighted an age gradient in distress among smokers, with

10

younger groups reporting higher levels of distress compared with older age groups.11

11

However, considering the sharp positive age gradient in the risk of death from COVID-1917,

12

deterioration in mental health during the pandemic may be more pronounced among older

13

age groups.

14
15

An increase in the prevalence of distress among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic in

16

England could potentially widen existing health inequalities. Monitoring levels of distress

17

among smokers is important to highlight unmet need for mental health and smoking cessation

18

support in general and also during current and potential future respiratory disease epidemics.

19

Using Smoking Toolkit Study (STS) data the aims of this study were to i) examine the

20

prevalence of psychological distress among past-year smokers during April-July 2020

21

compared with the same monthly time period (April-July) in 2016-2017 (the previous time

22

distress was assessed in the STS) and ii) examine the distribution of distress within

23

sociodemographic and smoking characteristic categories of past-year smokers during April-

24

July 2020 and April-July 2016-2017.

METHODS

3
4

Study design

5
6

Data were drawn from the Smoking Toolkit Study (STS), a monthly repeated cross-sectional

7

survey of a representative sample of adults in England.18 The dataset for the primary analysis

8

consisted of four months of STS data from April to July in each of the years 2016, 2017 and

9

2020. Respondents were age 18 years or older.

10
11

The STS uses a hybrid of random location and quota sampling to select a new sample of

12

approximately 1,700 adults each month. Locations are randomly selected from around

13

170,000 output areas in England stratified by geodemographic characteristics. Interviews are

14

performed with one household member until quotas based on factors influencing the

15

probability of being at home (e.g. gender, age, working status) are fulfilled. Comparisons

16

with other national surveys show that the STS recruits a representative sample of the

17

population in England.18 Data are usually collected monthly through face-to-face computer

18

assisted interviews. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2020 data were

19

collected via telephone only. Diagnostic analyses have suggested it is reasonable to compare

20

data from before and after the lockdown, despite the change in data collection method.16

21
22

Ethical approval for the STS is granted by the UCL Ethics Committee (ID 0498/001; ID:

23

2808/005). The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology

24

(STROBE) reporting guideline were used in the design and reporting of this study.19

Dependent variables, independent variables and covariates

The primary outcome of this study was the prevalence of psychological distress among past-

5

year smokers. This was derived using the following measures.

6
7

Mental health (Past-month psychological distress)

8
9

Past-month distress was measured using the K6 community screening measure of non-

10

specific psychological distress.20,21 The measure has ‘substantial’ concordance with

11

independent clinical ratings of serious mental illness.21 Participants were asked:

12
13

“During the past 30 days, about how often, if at all, did you feel... nervous; hopeless; restless

14

or fidgety; so depressed that nothing could cheer you up; that everything was an effort;

15

worthless?”

16
17

The answer options were presented in a randomised order and for each the respondent

18

indicated one of the following: “All of the time (scored 4); Most of the time (3); Some of the

19

time (2); A little of the time (1); None of the time (0)”

20
21

A sum score with a possible range from 0 to 24 was calculated. Based on previous research

22

scores of 13 and higher were categorised as serious distress, scores between 5-12 as moderate

23

and less than 5 as no/minimal distress.22

Smoking status

3
4

Smoking status was ascertained using responses to the following question:

5
6

“Which of the following best applies to you?”

7
8

Those who responded with “I smoke cigarettes (including hand rolled) every day” and “I

9

smoke cigarettes (including hand rolled), but not every day” were categorised as current

10

cigarette smokers.

11
12

Those who responded with “I smoke cigarettes (including hand rolled) every day”, “I smoke

13

cigarettes (including hand rolled), but not every day” and “I have stopped smoking

14

completely in the last year” were categorised as past-year smokers.

15
16

Those indicating that they do not smoke cigarettes, but do smoke tobacco of some kind (e.g.

17

Pipe, cigar or shisha) were excluded from the analysis (n=138) because they do not include

18

measures of dependence that are measured for cigarette.

19
20

Smoking and quitting behaviour

21
22

Cigarette addiction

23
24

Cigarette addiction was measured using the heaviness of smoking index (HSI).23 This HSI

25

uses two questions from the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence: time to first cigarette

in the morning after waking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Those with a score

2

>4 are considered to have high addiction, and those with <4 considered to have low/moderate

3

addiction.

5

Motivation to stop smoking

6
7

Motivation to stop smoking was assessed using the Motivation To Stop Scale24, a single-item

8

measure with seven response options representing increasing motivation to quit. Responses

9

were collapsed into two variables reflecting high vs. low or no motivation to stop smoking.24

10
11

Quit attempts

12
13

Quit attempts in the past month was measured among past year smokers using the question

14

“How many serious attempts to stop smoking have you made in the last 12 months?”, and if

15

one or more attempts were reported: “How long ago did your most recent serious quit attempt

16

start?”.

17
18

We distinguished those who attempted to quit up to 1 month ago versus those who made no

19

quit attempt or attempted to quit more than 1 month before the interview but were not

20

successful.

including nine categories: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East

Time period

10
11

The variable for time period included four months of data (April-July) each from the years

12

2016, 2017 and 2020. In this study, data from 2016 and 2017 were collapsed together to form

13

a new variable reflecting April-July 2016-2017. These time periods were chosen because

14

questions related to mental health outcomes were not included in the surveys during 2018 and

15

2019, and were only re-added from April 2020. The comparison of the same four month time

16

period in 2020 and 2016-2017 sought to account for potential seasonality in mental health

17

disorders.25,26

18
19

Sample selection

20
21

Overall, 19,960 (unweighted) adults aged 18+ were surveyed. Of these, 3,640 past-year

22

(current and recent ex) smokers were asked the mental health questions. Those who

23

exclusively smoked cigars and pipes (n = 138), did not complete the mental health questions

24

or selected ‘I don’t know’ or ‘prefer not to say’ in response to any of them (n = 399), or had

25

missing data on any of the other variables included in the present analysis were excluded.

This left a final unweighted sample size for analysis of 2,972 past-year smokers of which

2

2,418 were current smokers.

Statistical analysis

5
6

To address our first aim, weighted proportions (95% CIs) were used to describe the

7

prevalence of past-month moderate and severe distress, respectively, during the period of

8

April-July 2020, and April-July 2016-2017 among past-year smokers.

9
10

We constructed separate logistic regression models to assess changes in moderate and severe

11

distress, respectively, among smokers (past-year and current) between the two time periods

12

(April-July 2020 vs April-July 2016-2017 as referent) and age (six categories with 16-24 as

13

referent) and the interaction terms.

14
15

All associations are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (adjusted for

16

sex, social grade and region). The inclusion of the time period*age interaction allowed us to

17

examine psychological distress at different levels of age, which is of interest given the strong

18

age gradient in risk of death from COVID-19.17

19
20

To address our second aim, we: i) calculated weighted proportions and chi-square statistics to

21

compare the distribution of moderate and severe distress, respectively, within socio-

22

demographic (age, sex, social grade, whether there were children in the house) and smoking

23

characteristics (cigarette addiction, quit attempts and motivation to stop smoking) of past-

24

year smokers during April-July 2020 and April-July 2016-2017; and ii) constructed a series

25

of stratified logistic regression models to examine any changes within these socio-

Analysis was carried out in R version 3.6.0 in September 2020. A 2-sided P<.05 was

7

considered statistically significant. The analysis plan was pre-registered online at

10

Sensitivity analysis

11
12

The same analyses reported for the primary analysis was conducted but comparing April-July

13

2020 with all months in 2016-2017.

14
15

Unregistered post-hoc analyses

16
17

We conducted further logistic regression models to explore changes in moderate and severe

18

distress among recent ex-smokers (quit within the past year) between the two time periods

19

(April-July 2020 vs April-July 2016-2017 as referent) and age (six categories with 16-24 as

20

referent). We calculated Bayes factors (BF) for non-significant associations to explore

21

whether they provided evidence for no effect (BF < 1/3) when compared to the alternative

22

hypothesis or indicated data insensitivity (BF ≥ 1/3 and < 3).27 The alternative hypothesis was

23

modelled using a half-normal distribution centred on zero, with a standard deviation equal to

24

the expected effect size.

1

In 2016-2017 mental health data was only collected among current and recent ex-smokers.

2

From April 2020 all respondents were asked questions about their mental health, allowing us

3

to examine levels of distress across all categories of smoking status. Analysing distress

4

according to smoking status contextualises the findings among smokers against those who

5

have never smoked or have been abstinent for a long time. Further analyses were run

6

exploring differences in the prevalence distress between April-July 2020 according to

7

smoking status. The results are presented as weighted proportions (with 95% CIs). Logistic

8

regression was used to estimate the association between distress and smoking status (four

9

categories: Smoker, Stopped in the past year, Stopped >1 year ago and Never Smoker

10

(referent)).

RESULTS

13
14

A weighted total of 3,211 past-year smokers (mean (SD) age = 43.26 (17.11) years; 48.08%

15

women) completed the STS survey between April-July in 2016 (n = 1,106), 2017 (n = 1,066)

16

and 2020 (n = 1,039). Among the overall sample 748 (23.29%) reported moderate distress,

17

and 293 (9.12%) reported severe distress. See Table 1 for an overview of the sample

18

characteristics. Weighted prevalence statistics for moderate and severe distress among past-

19

year smokers in 2016, 2017 and 2020 are shown in Figure 1.

Past-year smokers in 2020 had twice the odds of moderate and severe distress, respectively,

17

compared with 2016-2017 (Table 2). An age gradient was apparent, with older age groups

18

less likely to report moderate or severe distress, respectively, compared with those aged 16-

19

24. There was no evidence of an interaction between time period and age.

Similarly, current smokers in 2020 had twice the odds of moderate distress compared with

Recent ex-smokers

3

Among the much smaller group of recent ex-smokers (n=277) there were no significant

4

associations between moderate or severe psychological distress, respectively, in 2020

5

compared with 2016-2017 (Supplementary Table s2). Based on observed increases in mental

6

health problems pre and post COVID-19 among the general population in the UK28,

7

exploratory expected effect sizes (ORs) were set to 1.1, 1.5 and 1.9 respectively. The

8

calculation of Bayes factors under all of these contexts indicated that the data were

9

insensitive to detect these effects (Supplementary Table s3).

The prevalence of moderate distress was higher in 2020 compared with 2016-2017 among:

22

those aged 16-24 and 45-54, women, those in more disadvantaged social grades, those with

23

and without children in the house, and among those with low cigarette addiction (Table 3).

24

No differences were apparent among those who had tried to quit within the past month or

25

among current smokers with high motivation to quit.

The prevalence of severe distress was higher in 2020 compared with 2016-2017 among: those

Between April-July 2016/17 and April-July 2020 in England there were increases in

4

moderate and severe distress, respectively, among both past-year and current smokers. Older

age groups were less likely to report symptoms compared with younger groups, but there was

6

no interaction between age and time period. Within socio-demographic categories, moderate

7

distress was greater in 2020 among those aged 16-24 and 45-54 years, women, those from

8

more disadvantaged social grades, those with and without children at home and those with

9

low cigarette addiction. Severe distress was greater in 2020 among those aged 65+, women

10

and among those with low cigarette addiction.

11
12

The increase in levels of both moderate and severe distress among smokers is likely caused

13

by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated stay-at-home restrictions that have

14

affected work and social life in England.29 Moreover, while mental health has deteriorated in

15

the overall population as a result of COVID-1912, our analysis using exclusively April-July

16

2020 data highlighted that smokers specifically continue to display elevated levels of distress

17

compared with non-smokers. Together these findings have concerning implications for

18

existing smoking-related health inequalities considering the strong and potentially bi-

19

directional associations between smoking and mental illness.8

20
21

Older smokers were less likely to report distress compared with younger groups.11 These

22

findings re-emphasise the need to address higher prevalence of poor mental health among

23

younger smokers.12,30,31 We hypothesised that there may be an interaction between age-group

24

and year with older smokers experiencing greater distress in 2020 due to the age gradient in

25

deaths from COVID-19 and the known risks of smoking. This was not borne out in the

primary analysis, but there were signals of age-group differences in our stratified socio-

2

demographic analyses discussed below.

3
4

Compared with 2016/17 the distribution of moderate distress in 2020 differed within certain

5

sociodemographic characteristics, with higher prevalence in those aged 16-24 and 45-54,

6

women, those from more disadvantaged social grades and in both those with and without

7

children in the home. The distribution of severe distress was broadly similar across the two

8

time periods, with the exceptions of higher prevalence in 2020 within women and those aged

9

65+. These demographic profiles of distress have important implications for existing

10

inequalities and support other findings that the impacts of COVID-19 on worsening mental

11

health have not been felt equally across society, but specifically among women and the more

12

socioeconomically disadvantaged.12 However, the reported significance of these stratified

13

socio-demographic analyses within age specifically (given the absence of interaction effects

14

described above), but also other characteristics should be treated with caution and viewed

15

descriptively.

16
17

Regarding smoking and quitting behaviour, our results indicate that between 2016/17 and

18

2020 there have been no changes in the prevalence of high cigarette addiction among those

19

with moderate or severe distress, respectively. There were, however, increases in the

20

prevalence of low addiction. Whether this phenomenon is unique to 2020 or represents a

21

sustained change in the mental health population (as has been observed in the general

22

population of smokers in England32) will be monitored going forward. The prevalence of past

23

month quit attempts or motivation to stop smoking (among current smokers) did not change

24

between 2016/17 and 2020 within any category of psychological distress. This is consistent

1

with recently published findings in the general population showing that COVID-19 triggered

2

only a minority of quit attempts in England.33,34

3
4

Recent YouGov data in England has suggested that those with existing mental health

5

problems may have been more likely to have quit successfully during the pandemic.35

6

However, robust analyses of this unexpected finding is needed. Moreover, the same YouGov

7

data has suggested that smokers with poor mental health who did quit during the pandemic

8

are smoking more and are less likely to quit as a result of COVID-19.

9
10

Findings from this study have implications for policy and practice. The levels of distress

11

among disadvantaged social grades and women, and the persistence of poor mental health

12

among younger smokers is concerning given that the prevalence of mental illness 2016/17

13

was already thought to be greater in these demographics than in previous years.36 It is

14

important that support for smoking cessation is available to those with mental health

15

problems during the pandemic and in its aftermath. Mental health practitioners should

16

continue to monitor the smoking status of their patients, and offer referral to local authority

17

stop smoking services where they can receive effective support for smoking cessation.37

18

Specific attention should be considered for smokers aged 65+ at this time, who are generally

19

more dependent on cigarettes38 and from our analyses appear to have greater distress than in

20

previous years. Advice on effective harm reduction alternatives such as electronic cigarettes

21

should also be considered.39,40 In addition, clear public health messaging about the immediate

22

health benefits of smoking cessation is necessary to counter the uncertainty that has emerged

23

related to some evidence that smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-Cov-2

24

infection.41

1

To our knowledge this study is the first to analyse psychological distress among smokers

2

using data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is limited by the use of

3

cross-sectional survey data where smoking status is self-reported. Moreover, we did not have

4

mental health data in 2018, 2019 and the first three months of 2020. While it is likely that

5

some of the increase in mental health problems in 2020 reflect a continuation of a secular

6

trend going back to 200836, data from the opinions and lifestyle survey collected between

7

2018 to date highlight a clear deterioration in wellbeing among smokers following the onset

8

of the pandemic in England.42

9
10

Future research should continue to monitor changes in distress among smokers throughout

11

the ongoing pandemic and its aftermath. Greater understanding about the direction(s) of the

12

relationship between smoking and mental illness will also help inform the best approach for

13

reducing smoking levels in this vulnerable group.

14
15

In conclusion, comparing April-July 2016/17 with April-July 2020 in England there were

16

increases in moderate and severe distress among smokers. Continued support and messaging

17

for smoking cessation among those with poor mental health is ever more important during the

18

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in its aftermath.
