Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic,
data from smartphones and connected sensors have been used
to better understand presentation and management outside the
clinic walls. However, reports on the validity of such data are
still sparse, especially when it comes to symptom progression
and relevance of wearable sensors.
Objective: To understand the relevance of Person-Generated
Health Data (PGHD) as a means for early detection, monitoring, and management of COVID-19 in everyday life. This type
of data include quantifying prevalence and progression of symptoms from self-reports as well as changes in activity and physiological parameters continuously measured from wearable sensors, and contextualizing findings for COVID-19 patients with
those from cohorts of flu patients.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective digital cohort study of individuals with a self-reported positive SARSCoV-2 or influenza test followed over the period 2019-12-02 to
2020-04-27. Three cohorts were derived: Patients who selfreported being diagnosed with flu prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic (N=6270, of which 1226 also contributed sensor
PGHD); Patients who reported being diagnosed with flu during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (N=426, of which 85 also shared
sensor PGHD); and patients who reported being diagnosed with
COVID-19 (N=230, of which sensor PGHD was available for 41).
The cohorts were derived from a large-scale digital participatory surveillance study designed to track Influenza-like Illness
(ILI) incidence and burden over time.
Exposures: Self-reported demographic data, comorbidities, and
symptoms experienced during a diagnosed ILI episode, including SARS-CoV-2. Physiological and behavioral parameters
measured daily from commercial wearable sensors, including
Resting Heart Rate (RHR), total step count, and nightly sleep
hours.
Main Outcomes and Measures: We investigated the percentage of individuals experiencing symptoms of a given type (e.g.
shortness of breath) across demographic groups and over time.
We examined illness duration, and care seeking behavior, and
how RHR, step count, and nightly sleep hours deviated from expected behavior on healthy days over the course of the infection
episode.
Results: Self-reported symptoms of COVID-19 present differently from flu. COVID-19 cases tended to last longer than flu
(median of 12 vs. 9 days), are uniquely characterized by chest
pain/pressure, shortness of breath, and anosmia. The fraction
of elevated RHR measurements collected daily from commercial
wearable devices rise significantly in the 2 days surrounding ILI
symptoms onset, but does not appear to do so in a way specific
*Authors contributed equally

to COVID-19. Steps lost due to COVID-19 persists for longer
than for flu.
Conclusion and Relevance: PGHD can be a valid source of
longitudinal real world data to detect and monitor COVID-19related symptoms and behaviors at population scale. PGHD
may provide continuous, near real-time feedback to intervention effectiveness that otherwise requires waiting for symptoms
to develop into contacts with the healthcare system. It has
also the potential to increase pre-test probability of other downstream diagnostics. To effectively leverage PGHD for participatory surveillance it is crucial to invest in the creation of trusted,
long-term communication channels with individuals through
which data can be efficiently collected, consented, and contextualized, while protecting the privacy of individuals and ultimately
facilitating the transition in and out of care.

Introduction
The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and
subsequent rapidly expanding pandemic has created significant gaps in our understanding of the prevalence of symptoms
among individuals with COVID-19.
Multi-disciplinary teams of physicians, data scientists, clinical informaticians, epidemiologists and many others around
the world have engaged in using real-world data collected
at point of care to help answer key questions around management of COVID-19 patients (see (1) for a US-centric
overview of initiatives and open questions). At the same time,
data from individuals in the context of participatory syndromic surveillance for COVID-19 (2–4) are being collected
via smartphone apps around the world to perform hotspot detection and show promise in understanding symptom presentation and prevalence outside the clinic walls (5). In addition
to self-report, recent literature suggests that data from commercial sensors may be used for large scale surveillance of
influenza outbreak, based on the fact that physiologic measures provided by the sensors (e.g., RHR) (6–8) and temperature (9) change in the presence of an infection. Several efforts are currently underway exploring the potential of wearable technology in support of syndromic surveillance aimed
at the COVID-19 pandemic (10–12), however, no data yet
exists on quantifying the link between COVID-19 disease
and changes in physiological and behavioral parameters over
the course of the disease. While specific clinical symptoms

such as shortness of breath, fever, and dry cough have become hallmark characteristics of the disease (13), symptoms
presentation and patient behavior outside the clinic walls has
received little attention. Lack of testing means we cannot
build a canonical symptom presentation, which significantly
undermines our ability to track, predict and control disease
progression and manage critical care.
Using a large-scale digital participatory surveillance study
designed for the purpose of monitoring ILI over the 20192020 influenza season, we present data collected from a cohort of individuals who have self-reported being diagnosed
by a medical provider with flu or COVID-19. A subset of
this cohort provided daily physiological and behavioral data
derived via wearable activity monitors (daily RHR, daily step
count, and nightly sleep hours) allowing for the explicit linkage of illness onset and continuously measured physiological
and behavioral parameters. Our contributions are twofold.
First, we present data on the progression of COVID-19 symptoms in everyday life and contextualize those by comparing
them with seasonal influenza. Second, we show that changes
in physiological signals such as RHR are associated with the
onset of symptoms, though they may not be specific to the
type of ILI. To our knowledge, this is the first study that looks
at longitudinal symptom reports of COVID-19 patients. It
is also the first study presenting symptom reports linked to
wearable data at the individual level for ILI (flu or COVID19), enabling temporal alignment of symptom reports with
correspondent changes in wearable data.

Dataset Description
Evidation Health currently supports a mobile consumer application called Achievement (14) that rewards members
based on completing health-related behaviors and participating in research by sharing Person-Generated Health
Data (PGHD). Achievement members can connect activity trackers and health applications and authorize Achievement to automatically and continuously ingest connected data
streams (15). Achievement has an active user base of 3.7M
individuals that are economically, demographically, and geographically diverse, and enables rapid (16) recruitment of
participants.
Since 2017, Achievement has been used to run a participatory ILI surveillance program, examining annual waves of
Influenza virus infections (17). The 2019-2020 version of the
program consists of sending a weekly one-click survey to all
Achievement members that asks if the individual experienced
any flu-like symptoms in the past 7 days. Individuals who
answer "yes" are immediately sent to a questionnaire, which
contains questions about the dates of illness onset and/or recovery, symptom experiences in the previous 7 days, healthcare interactions and outcomes, medications, and household
characteristics. On 2020-03-30, the questionnaire was updated to include questions that specifically address COVID19, including questions about COVID-19 diagnosis, testing,
and social distancing measures, as well as an expanded list of
symptoms (consisting of shortness of breath, chest pain, and
anosmia). The contents of the original and updated question2

naires are included in Supplementary Note 2 in the Appendix.
Since participants were sent a one-click survey every week,
participants could submit multiple survey responses for the
same ILI event. Responses to the original and updated surveys, collected between 2019-12-02 and 2020-04-27, comprise the initial survey dataset and include a total of 194,401
responses from 85,558 unique participants.
In addition to agreeing to participate and sharing their survey responses, participants agreed to share their activity data
from connected wearable sensors. The sensors data analyzed
in this project consisted of minute-by-minute step counts,
RHR recordings, and sleep states from 2019-11-01 to 202005-13 for the subset of participants with Fitbit sensors connected to the Achievement platform.

Methods
Survey Preparation. The pipeline for preparing the surveys

for analysis is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1 (a)
and summarized here. Initial survey cleaning consisted of
excluding all survey responses with self-reported illness onset dates or recovery dates that occurred 30 or more days
before the survey completion date, excluding surveys with
invalid illness onset and/or recovery dates (defined as dates
occurring after the survey date or responses in which the illness recovery date occurred before the illness onset date), removing multiple survey responses from the same participant
on the same day, and de-duplicating identical sets of survey
responses. This filtering process reduced the dataset from
194,401 survey responses from 85,558 unique participants to
146,133 responses from 71,556 unique participants.
Since participants could submit multiple survey responses
for the same ILI event, distinct ILI events were inferred by
merging survey responses from the same participant when the
dates encompassing self-reported illness onset through recovery overlapped or were separated by no more than two days.
The reconciliation process for merging individual question
responses is described in Supplementary Note 3 in the Appendix. After excluding participants with five or more ILI
events or multiple diagnosed ILI events (to remove participants with possible erroneous or fraudulent responses), the
analysis set was reduced to a subset of 6,926 ILI events with
self-reported confirmed diagnosis, each corresponding to a
different participant.
The analysis set was supplemented with demographic information (if available) from a different general health survey
that included information about gender, age, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, race, and pre-existing health conditions.
Since the general health surveys were completed at different
times as the ILI survey, there may be slight discrepancies in
time-variant demographic data, such as age, BMI, and health
conditions.
Cohort Definition. All participants included in the analysis

self-reported seeking medical care and being diagnosed with
flu and/or COVID-19 by a healthcare provider (N=6,926).

three cohorts. Participants who completed the amended survey and self-reported being diagnosed with COVID-19 were
assigned to the COVID-19 cohort (N=230). Participants who
completed the updated survey and reported being diagnosed
with the flu were assigned to the Non-COVID-19 Flu cohort (N=426). This group allows a comparison of COVID19 and flu cases that is not confounded by time of year, time
since survey completion, survey content, or recent large-scale
societal changes, such as shelter-in-place orders or changes
within the healthcare system. Participants who reported being diagnosed with both flu and COVID-19 (N=83) were assigned to the COVID-19 cohort, under the rationale that some
individuals may consider COVID-19 to be a type of flu, and
the relative order in the questionnaire (flu preceding COVID19). Finally, participants who reported being diagnosed with
flu in the original survey were assigned to the Pre-COVID19 Flu cohort (N=6270). These cases spanned the 2019-2020
flu season before the COVID-19 outbreak, and are included
to provide a comparison to a larger group of canonical flu
events.
Statistical Testing. A two-step statistical testing procedure

was used to test for differences in demographics, healthcare
care-seeking behavior, medical outcomes, and symptoms
among the three cohorts. First, for each sub-analysis (i.e.,
demographics, medical care-seeking, and symptom prevalence), a series of chi-squared tests of independence were
performed to test for an association between the three cohorts and the different possible outcomes for each category.
A Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for running
multiple chi-squared tests in each sub-analysis.
Second, follow-up two-proportion z-tests were performed to
test for differences in proportions for each outcome and each
pair of cohorts. These follow-up tests were only performed
for the categories with significant cohort differences as determined by the chi-squared tests.
Wearable Sensor Data Preparation. Of the 6,926 partic-

ipants with diagnosed ILI events, 4,778 (69%) have shared
as part of the study data from at least one wearable device
connected to the Achievement platform: 2,582 (37%) parLuca Foschini et al.

ticipants had connected Apple Watches, 2,166 (31%) had
connected Fitbit devices, 420 (6%) had connected Garmin
devices, 123 (2%) had connected Withings devices, and 17
(0.2%) had connected Misfit devices. We focus the analysis of sensor data on the subset of participants with connected Fitbit devices, consisting of minute-by-minute steps,
heart rate recordings, and sleep states, were available for a
subset of study participants. This data was collected from
2019-11-01 through 2020-05-13 and analyzed to investigate
the impact of COVID-19 and flu on everyday behavior and
physiology.
Since the sensor data was collected passively in real-world
settings, daily sensor wear-time varied across participants
and study days. We implemented a three step procedure to
enforce adequate data density around each ILI event prior
to analysis. First, we estimated if the sensor was worn for
each participant for each minute in the study period. Periods
of non-wear-time were defined as 180 or more consecutive
minutes of zero steps or null RHR recordings. Second, days
with 10 or more hours of sensor wear-time were tagged as
valid for analysis. For the sleep data, days with a main sleep
period recorded by Fitbit were considered valid. Third, the
analysis set was restricted to only include participants with
1) at least 10% of valid days for each day of the week in
the baseline period (defined as all participant-days that occurred outside the window of 10 days prior to and 20 days
after illness onset) and 2) at least 50% valid days in the time
period surrounding the ILI event (defined as all days within
the window of 10 days prior to 20 days after illness onset).
Dense sensor data was available for 41 COVID-19 patients
(36 with steps, 33 with RHR, and 35 with sleep), 85 NonCOVID-19 Flu patients (80 with steps, 60 with RHR, and 64
with sleep), and 1226 Pre-COVID-19 Flu patients (1193 with
steps, 1025 with RHR, and 979 with sleep). Sensitivity analysis on the valid day thresholds was conducted and results
did not change significantly when removing the requirement
of having 10% of valid days for each day of week, or lowering the percentage of individual valid days to as low as 30%.
The pipeline for preparing the wearable data for analysis is
illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1 (b).
Elevated RHR Prevalence. Similarly to previous work (8),

we examined the fraction of each cohort with elevated RHR
in the days preceding and following ILI onset. First, days
with no RHR recordings were imputed in order to ensure that
the cohorts were the same across days of interest. Imputed
RHR values were generated from predictions of a mixed effects regression model that was fit to all participant-days that
RHR was recorded. The model specified fixed-effects for the
week of the year to control for time of year effects (more
specifically, this consisted of three terms for the 1st, 2nd, and
3rd expansions of an ordinal variable for week of flu season),
a categorical fixed effect for the day of the week to account
for differences in activity patterns by day of week, a fixedeffect for the average activity level in the participants’ state of
residence to control for different state-wide shelter-in-place
and social distancing measures, and a random-intercept for
each participant’s baseline activity level to control for indibioRχiv

vidual differences in activity levels. The model was fit to all
participant-days with a RHR recording using the lme4 package for R (18). Note that the imputed values were used only
to fill days when RHR was not recorded, on all other days the
observed value was used.
Next, in order to account for individual differences in RHR
when defining thresholds for elevated RHR, RHR values
were converted to z-scores using each participant’s RHR
mean and standard deviation across all days. The fraction
of each cohort with elevated RHR was computed for the days
surrounding the ILI event, defined as 10 days prior to 20 days
after ILI onset. Elevated RHR was defined as being greater
than 1 standard deviation above the participant’s mean RHR.
Two-proportion z-tests were performed to answer the following two questions: 1. Does a greater fraction of the COVID19 cohort have elevated RHR in the days surrounding ILI onset (defined as Days -2 to 2 1 ) compared to baseline days
prior to ILI onset (defined as Days -10 to -5 2 ) and 2. Does
the fraction of participants with elevated RHR surrounding
ILI onset differ between COVID-19 and Flu cohorts?

Behavioral and Physiological Changes During ILI
Events. In order to characterize daily changes associated

with COVID-19 and flu events, we measured deviations from
typical healthy measurements (RHR, step count, sleep hours)
that occurred while participants were ill. We used a model on
symptom-free days (conservatively assumed all days excluding the range 10 days before symptoms onset and within 20
days after symptoms onset) to generate individualized estimates of daily measurements that would have been recorded
in the counter-factual scenario that the participant did not fall
ill, and then computed the excess, defined as the difference
(observed - estimated), on the days surrounding symptoms
onset, and finally report the excess as a measure of deviations from expected typical measurements. The symptomfree day model was a mixed effects regression model with
the same specification as what was used to impute missing
RHR values in the previous analysis. The key difference in
this analysis was that, in order to generate estimates based
only on assumed symptom-free days, we excluded all data
within 10 days before symptoms onset and within 20 days
after symptoms onset when fitting the model. In order to visualize the time course of behavioral changes during COVID19 and flu events, for each cohort we fit generalized additive
mixed models with spline smoothing functions and random
intercepts to the daily excess time series using the mgcv package for R (20). This procedure was performed three separate
times, once for each of the channels considered: daily total
step counts, daily RHR, and total daily sleep minutes.

1 We conservatively allow 2 days for physiological changes before any
symptom is reported, and up to 2 days after the onset of symptoms as the
time horizon within which actions can be taken that would not be taken otherwise, without information from the wearable device)

Results
In the following section, we compare the presentation of diagnosed COVID-19 cases (N=230) to two groups of diagnosed flu cases: Non-COVID-19 Flu cases (N=426), which
occurred in the same time frame as the COVID-19 cases, and
Pre-COVID-19 Flu (N=6270), which occurred earlier in the
2019-2020 flu season before the outbreak of COVID-19.
Comparison of Demographic Trends. A demographic

summary of the three cohorts is provided in Table 1. A
chi-squared test of independence was performed for each demographic category to test for significant differences across
the full cohorts. Age-group and race were the only demographics that differed significantly among the cohorts after
applying a Bonferroni correction to adjust for performing
five comparisons (age group: p=.008, race: p<.001). Compared to the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort, the COVID-19 cohort
was less likely to be White/Caucasian (63.9% vs. 70.0%)
and more likely to be Asian or Pacific Islander (9.6% vs.
4.6%) (follow-up two-proportion z-tests, p=.047 and p<.001,
respectively). The COVID-19 cohort was also more likely
to prefer not to report race than both the Non-COVID-19
Flu and Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohorts (p=.018 and p<.001, respectively). In follow-up comparisons, the proportion of
the COVID-19 cohort belonging to each age group was not
significantly different than the Non-COVID-19 Flu nor the
Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohorts, however a greater proportion of
the Non-COVID-19 Flu cohort was aged 55 or older compared to the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort (7.5% vs. 3.8%, twoproportion z-test, p=.001). The demographics of the analyzed cohorts differs from what described in the literature
for medically attended ILI events for the general US population (21). The sample should be reweighed (22) before
meaningful comparisons can be made with a target population with different demographics characteristics.
Care-seeking Behavior. Although all patients had to re-

port seeking medical care and being diagnosed with either
Flu or COVID-19 to be included in the analyses, locations
of medical care, hospitalization rates, and medication prescription rates differed significantly across the three cohorts
(chi-squared tests of independence with a Bonferroni correction, all p<.001), and are summarized in Table 2. Compared to Non-COVID-19 Flu and Pre-COVID-19 Flu patients, COVID-19 patients were less likely to seek care at a
primary care clinic (37.4% vs. 50.2% for Non-COVID-19
Flu, p=.002, and vs. 45.7% for Pre-COVID-19 Flu, p<.001)
or urgent care facility (16.1% vs. 23.5% for Non-COVID-19
Flu, p=.026, and vs. 39.1% for Pre-COVID-19 Flu, p<.001)
and more likely to seek care in an emergency room (17.0%
vs. 8.2% for Non-COVID-19 Flu, p<.001, and vs. 6.9%
for Pre-COVID-19 Flu, p<.001) or other location (37.4% vs.
50.2% for Non-COVID-19 Flu, p=0.002, and vs. 45.7% for
Pre-COVID-19 Flu, p<.001). An informal review of the freeform text responses provided for the "other" location suggest
that COVID-19 patients were more likely to seek care via
telehealth services.

Table 1. Demographic summaries for the full COVID-19, Non-COVID-19 Flu and Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohorts, as well as the subset of each cohort with dense steps, RHR,
and/or sleep data.

COVID-19 patients were more likely to be hospitalized
(36.1%) than Non-COVID-19 Flu (15.7%, p<.001) and PreCOVID-19 Flu (7.1%, p<0.001) patients. Interestingly, a
greater proportion of patients with recent flu events were hospitalized than those with flu events earlier in the season (NonCOVID-19 Flu vs. Pre-COVID-19 Flu, p<.001).
Both the COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Flu cohorts were
less likely to be prescribed medication than the Pre-COVID19 Flu cohort (p<.001 and p<.001), but the medication rates
between COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Flu patients did not
differ significantly (p=.202).
Symptom Prevalence. In addition to differences in medi-

cal care-seeking and outcomes, we also observed differences
in self-reported symptoms between COVID-19 and the two
cohorts of flu patients. A summary of symptom prevalence

across cohorts is reported in Table 3. The most common
symptoms across all ILI groups included cough, headache,
body muscle ache, fatigue, and fever. The prevalence of
symptoms was significantly different across the three cohorts (chi-squared test of independence, p<.001), confirming emerging literature and anecdotal reports (4, 10–13). All
follow-up pairwise symptom comparisons were tested with
two-proportion z-tests and a Bonferroni correction was applied for performing 33 tests.
Compared to the Non-COVID-19 Flu cohort, patients with
COVID-19 were significantly more likely to report experiencing cough (84.3% vs. 71.6%, two-proportion z-test,
p<.001), loss of sense of smell (anosmia) (38.3% vs. 15.5%,
p<.001), persistent pain or pressure in the chest (49.6% vs.

teristic of COVID-19 and have been reported to differentiate
COVID-19 from seasonal flu, although it’s important to note
that, with the exception of cough, these symptoms are not
necessarily common COVID-19 symptoms. For example, in
the COVID-19 cohort, reports of chest pain were as common
as reports of nasal congestion and sore throat, and reports of
anosmia were as common as sneezing.
Compared to the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort, the COVID19 cohort was significantly less likely to report experiencing
body muscle ache, fever or feeling feverish, nasal congestion
or runny nose, sneezing, chills or shivering, and sweats (all
p<.001). The prevalence of several symptoms (i.e., shortness
of breath, anosmia, and chest pain) could not be compared
between the COVID-19 and Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohorts because they were not included in the original survey. Together,
these findings are in line with recent work suggesting that the
presentation of COVID-19 differs from other ILIs (2, 23), in
particular with regard to anosmia, shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, and muscle aches.
With the exception of headache, all symptoms were significantly less prevalent in the Non-COVID-19 Flu cohort relative to the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort. One possible reason
for the difference in symptom presentations in the two flu cohorts is that the 2019-2020 flu season consisted of two waves
of different flu strains: strain B (Victoria lineage) appeared
earlier on and was followed by strain A (H1NI-pdm09) (24).
According to the CDC, vaccines for the 2019-2020 season
were well-matched against circulating strain A but not as
well-matched against strain B (25), which could account for
the more mild symptom presentation in the more recent flu
cases in the Non-COVID-19 Flu cohort compared to the earlier cases in the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort.

cohorts, we examined the prevalence of co-occurring sets of
symptoms for the COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Flu cohorts (Figure 2). The Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort was excluded from this analysis since only a subset of symptoms
were available for this cohort. To reduce the complexity of the possible symptom sets, we included only the 5
most prevalent symptoms in each cohort, which resulted in
a reduced set of 7 symptoms: cough, headache, fever, fatigue, body muscle ache, chills or shivering, and shortness
of breath. The two most common symptom sets consisted of
all symptoms, which was predominated by COVID-19 cases,
and all symptoms except for shortness of breath, which was
predominated by Non-COVID-19 Flu cases. The other symptom sets that were more indicative of COVID-19 than NonCOVID-19 Flu included the symptom pair of shortness of
breath and cough, and all symptoms other than chills or shivering.
Symptom Time Course. Patients reported the dates of ill-

ness onset and illness recovery, which were used to compute
the duration of each ILI event in days (Figure 3). Duration
of illness for COVID-19 cases tended to be longer than flu
cases; COVID-19 illnesses lasted a median of 12 days, compared to 9 days for the Non-COVID-19 Flu cases and 7 days
for the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cases.
Symptom prevalence across each cohort for each day after
illness onset is illustrated in Figure 4 and the days of peak
symptom occurrence for each cohort are reported in Table
3. In general, day-by-day symptom prevalence peaks later
for the COVID-19 cases compared to the two groups of flu
cases. With the exception of shortness of breath for NonCOVID-19 Flu cohort, all symptoms peak 2-3 days after illness onset in both flu cohorts. In contrast, COVID-19 symptoms peak 3-7 days after illness onset, with most symptoms
peaking 4-5 days after illness onset. Some of the latest peaking symptoms are those that are most tightly associated with

Table 3. Summary of self-reported symptoms for the COVID-19 (N=230), Non-COVID-19 Flu (N=426) and Pre-COVID-19 Flu (N=6270) cohorts. Symptom prevalence refers
to the percentage of the cohort reporting the symptom at any time during the ILI event and symptoms are sorted by most (top) to least (bottom) prevalence in the COVID-19
cohort. The day of peak symptom occurrence relative to illness onset corresponds to the maximum of a centered three-day rolling mean of day-by-day symptom prevalence
for each cohort. Some symptoms (i.e., shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, and anosmia) were only included in the updated survey and therefore are not available for
the Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohort.

Wearable Sensor PGHD. Objective PGHD from commer-

cial Fitbit sensors were available for at least one day between 2019-11-01 and 2020-05-13 for approximately 31%
of all participants. A smaller subset of these participants met
the criteria for sensor data density and were included in the
analysis, including 41 (18%) COVID-19 patients, 85 (20%)
Non-COVID-19 Flu patients, and 1,226 (20%) Pre-COVID19 Flu patients. The demographics of the cohorts with dense
sensor data are described in Table 1. The same two-step statistical testing procedure was applied to test for demographic
differences among participants with (N=1,352) and without
(N=5,574) dense sensor data. Compared to participants without dense Fitbit data, those with dense Fitbit data were more
likely to be female (p<0.001), white (p<0.001), obese (30+
BMI, p=0.003), and in an older age group (45-54, p<0.001;

Elevated RHR. Given the association between elevated RHR

and the inflammatory immune system response (27, 28),
we examined the prevalence of elevated RHR among the
COVID-19, Non-COVID-19 Flu, and Pre-COVID-19 Flu
around the ILI events (Figure 5. Elevated RHRs were defined as RHRs that surpassed participants’ mean RHR levels
by 0, 0.5, or 1 standard deviation. In both the COVID-19
and Pre-COVID-19 Flu cohorts, we observe a spike in the
prevalence of elevated RHR in the first few days after illness onset. We ran two-proportion z-tests to test 1) whether a
greater proportion of COVID-19 patients had elevated RHRs
around illness onset compared to before illness onset and 2)
whether the prevalence of elevated RHR around illness onset
differed between COVID-19 and Flu cases. The percent of
COVID-19 patients with elevated RHRs (defined as a RHR
>1 standard deviation above their personal mean RHR) was
higher around the onset of COVID-19 (from Days -2 to 2)
compared to the baseline period 5-10 days before illness onset (25% vs. 13%, p=0.005). The percent of the COVID-19
cohort with elevated RHR around illness onset was higher
than that of the Non-COVID-19 cohort (16%, p=0.026), but
did not differ from that of the Pre-COVID-19 cohort (22%,
p=0.454).
ILI Impact Estimation. Symptoms reports analyzed in pre-

vious sections can be understood as an assessment of the
deviation from how the participant normally feels. In this
section we present an analysis of wearable data to derive an
analogous of the concept of deviations from the norm during the ILI event that symptoms reports capture. The objective impact of ILI (COVID-19 or flu) was quantified as
the excess observed in daily steps lost, additional minutes
of sleep, and increased RHR as compared to the expected
measurements recorded in the counter-factual scenario where
symptoms were not present for that day and individual, as
estimated from a model fit only to symptom-free days. We
present aggregate time series of these excesses for each of the

Figure 6.
Results are shown in Figure 6. Reductions in daily step
counts are more marked and prolonged for COVID-19 as
compares to Non-COVID-19 Flu and Pre-COVID-19 Flu.
This is consistent with our observation of more extended
symptoms and illness durations in the COVID-19 patients,
but may also be explained by the adoption of more stringent
self-imposed quarantine measures after COVID-19 diagnosis
in addition to shelter-in-place. RHR has similar profiles for
flu and COVID-19, suggesting the possibility to be used for
real-time detection and monitoring of the time-course of the
illness, but not necessarily forecasting before (self-reported)
symptom onset or distinction of different ILIs. Sleep changes
appear inconclusive, as the post-onset total sleep time increase observed for pre-stay-at-home flu may be explained
by changes in sleeping schedule during sick days that would
be less prominent when working from home.

Conclusions
We present the first read-out of PGHD including longitudinal symptoms reports and linked data from commercial wearables for 6,926 diagnosed flu and 230 diagnosed COVID-19
patients remotely collected in real-life settings.
We describe symptoms across different ILIs, in order to build
a better understanding of COVID-19 presentation and contextualize it with flu. Specific symptoms, including chest
pain, shortness of breath or anosmia, as well as combinations of these symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath and coughing) were more prevalent in COVID-19 as compared to NonCOVID-19 Flu. Other symptoms, including fatigue and
cough, were more pronounced later after illness onset. Generally, patients reported longer COVID-19 illnesses (median
of 12 days) than Non-COVID-19 and Pre-COVID-19 Flu illnesses (9 and 7 days, respectively).
Our results show that COVID-19 patients are far more likely
to seek emergency care, and are more likely to be hospi8

talized. This observation supports the severity with which
COVID-19 infection is taken, and the scaling up of the medical response to the pandemic. We also observe however that
COVID-19 patients are less likely to be prescribed medication, indicating the current dearth of available proven treatments, and further underlining the need for remote monitoring and containment (29).
Differences in self-reported symptoms are supported by data
from the subset of our cohort who also contributed wearable
sensors PGHD. We observed that activity (measured as lost
steps) was reduced longer and more prominently for COVID19 patients as compared to other groups. This is consistent with the observed longer illness durations for COVID19 generally, but could also reflect orders to self-quarantine.
Consistent with this line of reasoning, 89% of the COVID19 cohort reported being told by a medical provider to selfquarantine compared to only 57% of the Non-COVID-19 Flu
cohort.
We observe a significantly increased fraction of participants
with elevated RHR measurements in the 2 days surrounding
ILI symptoms onset. This has previously been observed for
other ILIs (7), and is also observed for COVID-19 patients.
If validated in large and representative populations (30), our
findings suggest the potential for PGHD to support remote
monitoring of infectious disease patients, with opportunities
ranging from improve resource allocation for further remote
diagnostic, to inform population-level early-warning systems
based on geo-localized aggregate symptoms.
The prominence of passively collected sensor data among
other PGHD data sources requires further investigation. The
key observation from our findings is that although sensor
data can be a general, real-time trigger for ILI recognition
and tracking, subjective symptom information is required to
provide specificity in distinguishing COVID-19 from flu and
likely other ILI. While disease-specificity may be improved
by additional data sources such as pulse oximetry, respiration
rate, electrodermal activity, but may still ultimately require
further interactions with the individual. This underlines that

to assess any clinical utility.
Biases & Limitations. The studied cohorts come from con-

venience samples that are not representative of the US population at large, in particular we note that African-Americans,
alongside older individuals, are underrepresented in our cohort therefore our findings may not generalize. Increasing access and usage of these tools in these risk groups (31) is therefore of critical importance. Differences in the rate of the occurrence across demographic groups and disease severity levels have not been investigated, though preliminary findings
point to possible differences with other ILIs (23, 32). Largescale connected populations offer the ability to reduce this divide and examine the impact COVID-19 is having across demographic and geographic groups, helping to highlight vulnerable populations and target care delivery (4).
It is also clear that even our approach may underestimate
severity, due to participants not reporting symptoms or not
wearing sensors in days when symptoms are most severe, or
during hospitalization events (see Figure S3). The conclusions presented here may therefore even be conservative.
Additionally, we recognize that our analyses do not immediately translate to real-time implementation, due to lag in data
collection that comes from sensor synchronization and data
synchronization. Lags in our dataflow are nevertheless small
compared to the gains in symptom detection and reporting
compared to canonical practice.
Clearly the COVID-19 pandemic is still in its infancy, and although our work on surveying annual waves of ILI infections
is well established, testing is currently reserved for patients
with severe symptoms, or strongly suspected to be infected
with COVID-19. This could create a self-fulfilling prophecy
where patients that match the current assumptions about presentation are more likely to be tested, and therefore more
likely to confirm current thinking in our symptom reporting.
For example, a patient with non-canonical COVID-19 symptoms may not get tested but simply be told they have another
ILI. This further underlines the criticality of widespread testing to develop a canonical presentation.
We are also aware that in our selection of ILI events, for each
participant we select COVID-19 events or the most recent ILI
event. This biases our analysis towards later calendar dates
when sensor data is most affected by social distancing. For
this reason we have included a chronologically parallel group
of Non-COVID-19 Flu patients. A second issue is that we
could be missing participants’ most severe ILI events, which
could have happened earlier in the season. We will continue
to monitor symptomatic and behavioral changes associated
with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ILIs as more events are
captured and as guidance on social distancing and stay-athome measures are relaxed. Further analysis will focus on
how strongly these measures confound our observations.
Outlook. These subjective (self-reported) and objective (via

commercial wearables) PGHD allow us to learn about symptom presentation, care-seeking behavior, and contextualize
COVID-19 as compared to flu. As more data is being collected, further work will focus on increasing the breadth of

participation, and examining other PGHD signals which may
support early detection and differentiation of ILIs. To accelerate learnings and findings generalizability it would be desirable that the many ongoing study initiatives could participate in the creation of a data consortium to facilitate access
to cross-study harmonized datasets to a broader audience of
qualified researchers, following the example of data consortia
that are being created for Real-World Data (33).
As care becomes more decentralized and telehealth becomes
more prominent (34), PGHD can become a valuable tool
on an individual level as patients transition in and out of
care (35). Equally, taken in aggregate, PGHD can provide
insights into public health, such as hotspot detection and real
time-monitoring for public health interventions, crucial in
monitoring effectiveness of reopening and enabling contact
tracing (29, 36).
The vast majority of learnings about COVID-19 have come
from real world data sources such as EHR, claims, etc.
PGHD can be an crucial addition to the real world data arsenal, adding a large-scale understanding of early signals, several days before impact is seen at centers of care. As the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, and as future annual ILI waves arrive, understanding and correctly reacting
to symptom presentation will be critically important. These
results support not only an emerging picture that COVID-19
has a distinct presentation, but highlight the power of PGHD,
digital health, and connected populations in broadly and remotely monitoring health status.

Fig. S1. (a) Flow diagram for preparing survey data for analysis. Data preparation consisted of filtering survey responses and merging
responses that correspond to the same ILI event. (b) Flow diagram for preparing Fitbit wearable data. Participants with data too sparse
were filtered out.

Survey Filtering. Survey responses with self-reported illness onset dates or recovery dates that occurred 30 or more days
before the survey completion date were excluded, leaving 158,999 survey responses from 73,728 unique participants. Survey
responses with invalid illness onset and/or recovery dates (defined as dates occurring after the survey date or responses in
which the illness recovery date occurred before the illness onset date) were also removed, leaving 149,309 survey responses
from 71,556 unique individuals. Finally, the set of survey responses was restricted to one survey per participant per day. If one
participant attempted more than one survey in a given day, the less complete survey was excluded.
Inference of Distinct ILI Events. Participants could submit new survey responses as frequently as once per week, with no

maximum limit. Therefore, individual symptom trajectories for an ILI event had to be inferred by concatenating and reconciling
multiple surveys responses, for example, if the participant were midway through their illness when they submitted their first
survey their next survey could describe the second half of their illness.
We inferred ILI events by merging multiple surveys from the same participant with date ranges encompassing symptoms onset
and recovery that overlapped or were separated by no more than 2 days. Participants with more than 5 ILI events were removed,
eliminating 16,878 surveys and 1,639 participants, and leaving 126,014 survey responses, corresponding to 99,604 distinct ILI
events and 69,034 participants.
This gives the set of discrete ILI events per participant, from which we will select only 1 for analysis. If a participant has a
diagnosed COVID-19 ILI event, that event is selected, otherwise the most recent ILI event is selected. This process removes
a further 40,357 surveys and 30,567 distinct ILI events, and 0 participants. Participants reporting multiple non-overlapping
diagnosed COVID-19 events were then excluded (excluding 7 survey responses, 6 distinct ILI events, and 3 participants).
Reconciliation of Merged Survey Responses. At this point, we have one ILI event per participant, corresponding to 85,650

surveys for 69,031 distinct ILI events across 69,031 participants. We then reconcile responses to derive a single value per item.
For example, the date of onset and recovery are taken as the earliest and latest reported date for that ILI event, respectively.
Flu events drawing from multiple surveys responses may have differing symptoms reports for the same calendar date. Such
day-level values (e.g., symptoms reported for a specific day) were collapsed if identical, and if not, the survey submitted on the
date closest to the calendar date was used. Participants were also allowed to report annotations, for example "the worst day",

during a given event. These are highly subjective, thus all responses were retained, with a given date coded as "one of the worst
days" if the participant indicated as such in any survey.
For event-level categorical features, the algorithm described in Figure S1 was used to collapse surveys to a single response.
Numerical event-level features, for example the number of household members who have experienced ILI symptoms, were
aggregated by taking the maximum value reported. All other features which could not be reconciled were simply aggregated as
concatenated unique values.
