Effects of physical activity and exercise on well-being in the context of the Covid-19
pandemic
Abstract
Background: A disease discovered in China, COVID-19, was characterized by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic in March 2020. Many countries in the world
implemented social isolation as a strategy to contain the virus transmission. The same
physical distancing which protects society from COVID-19 from spreading may have an
impact on the mental health and well-being of the population This study aims to shed some
light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and SWB
among individuals in the social isolation period of COVID-19.
Methods: Data were collected in Brazil between March 31st and April 2nd, 2020. All
volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement right after
reading the Consent Terms. The inclusion criteria were participants over 18 years old who
had been in social isolation for at least one week and agreed to the Consent Terms. Three
instruments were used: a questionnaire was built for this study which aimed to assess the
participants’ exercise routine. The second instrument called Psychosocial Aspects, Wellbeing and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) was also created by these researchers and
aimed to assess the relationship between well-being and physical activity during the social
isolation period. And the third measure was the Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).
Findings: A total of 592 participants reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4
(SD=3.3) days. The amount of participants who reported strength training as exercise
increased from 31 (5.2%) before isolation to 82 (13.9%) during quarantine. The study shows
that well-being related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine is linked to an
established routine of physical activity prior to the social isolation period.
Interpretation: People who already practiced physical activity feel more motivated to
continue practicing during this period and this causes the appearance of positive affects,
unlike people who are only now starting to exercise; according to the study, negative aspects
can occur for those who are only just starting. In a period of social isolation, it is important
that the practice of physical activity is closer to previous habits, also finding that an
obligation to exercise during this period when this was not a reality for the person can
contribute to an increase in malaise.

Introduction
The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) was discovered in China in December
2019 in the city of Wuhan, and soon became a public health emergency of international
interest (Wang et al., 2020). Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of
severe acute respiratory syndrome, which can cause respiratory infections. The clinical

conditions vary from mild to moderate and at times evolve into severe. In its milder form, the
manifestation of symptoms is similar to that of a common flu: symptoms such as fever,
coughing, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, headache and a sore throat and runny nose.
The virus can be transmitted from one person to another through droplets of saliva or mucus,
expelled through the mouth or nostrils when an infected person coughs or sneezes (WHO,
2020).
On March 11th, 2020, Covid-19 was characterized by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as a pandemic. One of the preventive measures suggested by the WHO to contain its
contagious spread was physical distancing between people, instructing everyone to stay in
their homes (Findik et al., 2012; (Geelhoed, 1978); Ward, 2000; WHO, 2020). An
interruption of daily activities such as work, studies, and leisure, among others, occurred in
an attempt to prevent the increase in cases in the country. Since the beginning of March,
most states in Brazil have adhered to social isolation and the population constantly refers to
this period as quarantine (Brazil, 2020). Social isolation is the behavior where a person or a
group of people, voluntarily or involuntarily, withdraws from social interactions and
activities, therefore decreasing the chances of greater spread of diseases (Hawryluck et al.,
2004).
In the COVID-19 pandemic, asymptomatic people may transmit the virus, so there is
a great need for social distancing for the entire population, not only including those at risk or
including who are proven to be infected. The Ministry of Health in Brazil published through
ordinance 356 of March 11th, 2020, that “...isolation policies aim to separate symptomatic
and asymptomatic people diagnosed with COVID-19 from the rest of the population in order
to prevent the spread of infection and local transmission” (Brazil, 2020).
However, the same physical distance, which protects COVID-19 from spreading, may
have an impact on mental health and the well-being of the population. In a 2004 study of 129

Canadian people who were quarantined due to the SARS epidemic outbreak, symptoms of
post-traumatic and depressive stress were observed. The symptoms were directly related to
age, educational level, living with other adults and not having children, and the duration of
quarantine. The longer in isolation, the greater the risk of symptoms to appear (Hawryluck et
al., 2004). The same results were found in similar studies of SARS quarantine in Taiwan (Bai
et al., 2004) and Hong Kong (Lee et al., 2005). Filgueiras and Stults-Kolehmainen (2020)
recently studied the psychosocial factors among Brazilians in quarantine due to Covid-19 and
found that gender, quality of nutrition, attendance in tele-psychotherapy, exercise frequency,
presence of older adults in quarantine with the person, obligation to work outside, education
level (more educated, lesser risk for mental illness) and age (younger age, greater risk)
predicted depression and anxiety states.
According to the most consensual and empirically tested definition, Subjective WellBeing (SWB) refers to understanding how people assess their own lives. Such assessments
must be cognitive (overall satisfaction with life and other specific domains such as marriage
and work) and must also include a personal analysis of the frequency with which positive and
negative emotions are experienced. For an adequate level of SWB to be reported, it is
necessary for the individual to recognize higher levels of life satisfaction, a high frequency of
positive emotional experiences and a low frequency of negative emotions (Siqueira &
Padovam, 2008). This leads to the assumption that lower levels of SWB are also linked to
higher levels of psychosocial symptoms such as anxiety, depression and stress (Whitehead et
al., 2019). In fact, there is evidence that supports this hypothesis among different types of
samples, such as: children and adolescents (Pate et al., 2019), young adults (Whitehead et al.,
2019) and older adults (Cheng et al., 2019).
Recent evidence supports the pivotal role of physical activity and exercise to decrease
stress, depression and anxiety-like symptoms (Cid et al., 2007; Berger, 2004; Stuart &

Nanette, 2007; Buckworth & Dishman, 2002; Kekäläinen et al., 2019; Panza et al., 2019;
(Singleton, 2019). The International Society of Sport Psychology (Singer, 1992), provided a
consensus statement linking physical activity and psychological benefits, and their
conclusion was that long-term exercise is generally associated with reduced anxiety and
stress levels, a decrease in depression levels, and an increase in subjects’ self-esteem and
positive emotions.
According to the meta-analysis carried out by (Stuart & Nanette, 2007), sessions of
twenty to sixty minutes, three to five times a week, with an intensity between 60%-90% of
the maximum cardiac frequency (FCMax) are the key factors for physical exercise to
generate more consistent psychological benefits (Berger, 2004; Buckworth & Dishman,
2002; A.Cruz, 1996; Samulski & Noce, 2000). Thus, the main hypothesis based on this
evidence provided by the literature so far is that physical activity leads to reduced
psychosocial symptoms and negative affect, whereas it also means increase in positive affect
and overall SWB. However, it is unclear whether people in quarantine are able to engage in
such frequency and regularity of exercise and if this practice is enough to provide SWB. The
present research aims to shed some light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship
between physical activity and SWB among individuals in the social isolation period by
COVID-19.

Method
Sample
The sample consisted of a total of 592 participants [371 women (62.7%), 220 men
(37.2%) and 1 transgender (0.01%)], with an average age of 32.3 years (SD=10.5). All
volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement right after
reading the Consent Terms.

Procedures
This study was conducted between March 31st and April 2nd, 2020. The project was
approved by the Ethical Committee of the last author’s institution under the protocol
no.2020.876-459. All procedures were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and the
Ethical guidelines of the Brazilian authorities. Volunteers were recruited via authors’ social
media and messaging smartphone apps. Upon receiving the link to answer the questionnaire,
the participant had access to the research presentation and Consent Terms, explaining that
this research was voluntary and non-mandatory and that the information obtained would be
kept anonymous. After agreement to participate, those who did not accept were directed to a
thank you page; whereas the others were addressed to the demographic questionnaire. The
appearance order of questions and instruments were always the same: (1) Consent Terms, (2)
demographic questionnaire, (3) exercise routine, (4) PAWEC, (5) PANAS, (6) Thank you
page.
The inclusion criteria were participants over 18 years old who had been in social
isolation for at least one week and agreed to the Consent Terms. Exclusion criteria were
volunteers with a history of any kind of psychiatric condition, even those under treatment,
and those who self-reported to be sedentary.
Instruments
Three instruments were used online and sent in a single form of Google Docs.
Respondents first had access to the Consent Terms. After agreement to participate, the
sociodemographic section was presented (age, gender, education, number of days in
quarantine, physical activity and exercise habits) followed by the three questionnaires in
separate sections.
The first questionnaire was created for this study. It is an 8-item instrument which
aimed to assess the participants’ exercise routine. Five questions were answered in

dichotomous multiple-choice options: 1 - “Yes” or 2 - “No”. Items answered using the
previous scale were: (i) “Have you been monitored by an online fitness coach during
quarantine?”, (ii) “Were you monitored by a fitness coach before isolation?”, (iii) “Did you
use any media source (i.e., YouTube, Social Media, videos, smartphone apps, etc.) to
exercise before the quarantine?”, (iv) “Do you use any media source (i.e., YouTube, Social
Media, videos, smartphone apps, etc.) to exercise during isolation?” and (v) “Are you doing
exercise more frequently now than before the quarantine?”.
Another two items (i.e., “What physical activities do you do?” and “What physical
activities did you use to do before confinement?”) were answered using the following
options: “strength training”, “functional training”, “yoga/pilates”, “martial arts/fighting”,
“walking/running”, “dancing/zumba”, “bicycle”, “swimming” and “other”; participants were
instructed to consider the type of exercise they did most frequently. The final question was
responded using an open-ended form in which volunteers had to provide information
regarding “the number of days you practice exercise or physical activity before isolation.”
The second instrument called Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being and Exercise in
Confinement (PAWEC) was also created by these researchers and aimed to assess the
relationship between well-being and physical activity during the social isolation period. It is
an 18-item questionnaire which seeks to investigate whether the frequency that physical
activity and exercise had a positive or a negative influence on psychological and SWB
aspects, namely mood, happiness, motivation, anxiety and sadness. The answers were
provided in a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “Always” to “Never” (specifically, 1 “Always”, 2 - “Sometimes”, 3 - “Rarely” and 4 - “Never”). Among the 18 items of this
measure, 8 items are scored inversely (items 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 and 18). Examples of
items are: item 7 - “Do you feel happy while exercising in quarantine?”, item 9 - “How often

do you believe it is important to exercise during isolation?” and item 13 - “Do you feel
anxious whenever you exercise during quarantine?”.
The third measure was the Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) by Pires et al. (2013). It is a 20-item instrument to be
answered in a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 - “totally disagree” to 5 - “totally
agree”) which was originally developed by Watson, Clark and Tellegen (1988), and aims to
measure Positive Affect (AP) and Negative Affect (NA), defined as general dimensions that
describe the affective experience of individuals. High scores in NA reflect subjective
displeasure and malaise, including emotions such as fear, nervousness and disturbance. High
levels of PA implicate subjective pleasure and well-being, including emotions such as
enthusiasm, inspiration and determination. The Brazilian version of PANAS presented a twofactor structure of significantly moderate negative correlation between factors (r=-0.42) and
reliability of α=0.84 measured by Cronbach’s alpha, ranging from α=0.88 in the positive
affect dimension to α=0.90 in the negative affect factor (Pires et al., 2013).
Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated according to the nature of the measure:
frequency and percentage were provided for categorical data, whereas arithmetic average
and standard deviation (SD) were provided for continuous data. Cronbach’s alpha (α) was
computed in order to investigate preliminary reliability of PAWEC. The preliminary validity
was assessed using an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) which was performed adopting
the (Baglin, 2014) recommendation for ordinal variables. The procedure to determine the
number of factors was the Parallel Analysis (PA) using the polychoric correlation matrix,
the Unweighted Least Square (ULS) factor modeling was performed to assess factor
retention and the Direct Oblimin rotation was adopted as an oblique method if needed due to
expectancy of correlated factors, even though significant negative correlation was expected.

After ensuring enough reliability and validity of both measures developed for this
research, a linear multiple regression (LMR) was separately computed for PA and NA
PANAS scores as dependent variables. The stepwise method was adopted in those
regressions. The first step was the PAWEC total score, demographic (i.e., age, gender,
education and number of days in quarantine) and exercise routine variables were considered
to predict the results of both PANAS factors. The second step of the regression comprised
the PAWEC items independently. The significance level for variable inclusion in the LMR
was p<0.05, the beta (β) coefficient revealed the strength of the association level between
independent and predicted variables, t-test statistics (in addition to the p-value and effect
size) were computed to assess whether one variable would be included in the LMR or not,
and an ANOVA was provided to compare the LMR model to the null-hypothesis (i.e. the
constant). The effect size was measured by the f2 statistics of the respective ANOVA
considering the following interpretation: above 0.02 and below 0.15 is a small effect size,
above 0.15 and above 0.35 is considered a moderate effect size, and above 0.35 is a large
effect size. Descriptive statistics and LMR were computed in the free R software program
using the psych package. EFA was performed in the FACTOR software program (Baglin,
2014) and effect sizes were calculated in the G*Power version 3.1.9.2 software program.

Results
Participants reported in the demographic questionnaire being in an average of 14.4
(SD=3.3) days in social isolation with other 2.7 (SD=2.3) people living with them during this
period. Volunteers showed diverse levels of education, with 150 (25.3%) answering to have
completed elementary school, 161 (27.1%) had a high school degree, 172 (28.9%) were
attending College, 28 (4.7%) had a Bachelor’s degree, 41 (8.1%) reported to have a Master’s
degree and 35 (5.9%) a Ph.D. Regarding marital status, 343 (57.9%) participants were single

and 189 (31.9%) were married. Finally, volunteers responded to have 2.1 (SD=2.6) children.
In addressing the exercise routines of the participants, the data showed that they engaged in
physical activities on average 4.5 (SD=1.2) days per week. Categorical variables of the
exercise routine of participants are shown in Table 1.
----------------------------------------------------PLEASE, INSERT TABLE 1 HERE
----------------------------------------------------Type of exercise before and during quarantine changed frequency, although it is not
possible to infer statistical differences. The amount of participants who reported strength
training as exercise increased from 31 (5.2%) before isolation to 82 (13.9%) during
quarantine; functional training also increased from 26 (4.4%) to 292 (49.3%), yoga/pilates
practice decreased from 63 (10.6%) to 36 (6.1%), martial arts/fighting also decreased with
107 (18.1%) of the volunteers reporting to practice it before quarantine and only 10 (1.7%)
during isolation; walking/running increased as the main exercise for people from 27 (4.6%)
to 71 (12.0%) before and during confinement, respectively; dancing/zumba remained almost
the same, being reported to be the main exercise of 28 (4.7%) before quarantine to 27 (4.6%)
during isolation; bicycle training (either exercise bike or traditional cycling) decreased from
162 (27.4%) to 19 (3.2%); swimming also decreased from 99 (16.7%) to 2 (0.3%), and other
types of exercise including possible combinations increased from 49 (8.3%) before isolation
to 53 (9.0%) during confinement.
The psychometric properties of PAWEC were to be provided before proceeding with
other analyses. Preliminary EFA results showed sample adequacy for KMO=0.849 and a
significant Bartlett sphericity test: χ2=3509.238, df=153; p<0.001. PA revealed that the best
solution would be a 3-factor structure that explains 53.54% of the variance cumulatively.

----------------------------------------------------Next, three dimensions were named based on the content of items loaded in the same
factor: exercise effects (positive or negative affect of exercise for people in quarantine),
cognition (cognitive variables which entail understanding reasons and importance of exercise
during confinement) and mood (motivational and emotional aspects involved in exercising
during social isolation). Reliability of the entire PAWEC was α=0.84. Separately, the factor
exercise effects presented α=0.77, the factor cognition showed α=0.71 and the factor mood
had α=0.82.
After reassuring the validity and reliability of PAWEC, the first LMR computed was
the Positive Affect score of PANAS as the dependent variable. The model was significant for
F(5,30)=30.850; p<0.001; f2=0.06 with 19% of the variance explained according to the
r2=0.19. Regarding the Negative Affect factor of PANAS, the model was also significant for
F(7,28)=35.498; p<0.001; f2=0.08 and coefficient of determination r2=0.22, which suggests
that the variance of NA explained by independent variables was 22%. Table 3 provides
statistical coefficients of the two LMR.

Discussion
This study aimed to understand the relationship between physical activity and SWB
among individuals in the social isolation period due to COVID-19. Considering the presented
results, the practice of physical activity during the quarantine was associate to SWB in the

aspects regarding mood, effects of exercise, gender, number of days in social isolation, the
use of media resources and the frequency of physical activity before and during the
quarantine.
Although the main goal of this research was to understand the relationship between
aspects of exercise and SWB, an instrument was developed for measuring attitude of
individuals toward exercise during quarantine. The PAWEC was a scale created for this
study and factorial analysis pointed to a three-factor model as the best framework to explain
the latent structures of physical activity among people in confinement situations. Exploratory
factor analysis were conducted according to Baglin’s (2014) suggestions and revealed good
sample adequacy and capacity for factorial rotation, which was required since the instrument
showed a multidimensional structure. The first PAWEC’s dimension was mood (i.e., either
positive or negative effects of exercise for people in quarantine, but not necessarily after
exercising, more of an overall feeling such as feeling less anxious or feeling more motivated
to work out during the quarantine). The second PAWEC’s factor found in this EFA was
named exercise effects (i.e., motivational and emotional positive aspects involved in
exercising during social isolation, such as feeling happy or feeling well disposed after
exercising). The last of the PAWECs dimensions was cognition (i.e., understanding reasons
and importance of exercise during confinement such as believing being necessary to exercise
and understanding to be important to practice physical activity). All factors separately and
the scale as a whole showed Cronbach’s alpha above 0.70, which was considered enough to
assume good internal consistency. The instrument, then, proved to be reliable and well
structured.
Results suggested that the exercise effects dimension of the PAWEC was correlated
with both negative and positive affect subscale of the PANAS. The more the person feels that
physical activity during confinement has a clear effect in their feelings, the greater the

association to both dimensions of the SWB. It means that a person who does not enjoy
exercising will probably not feel neither positive nor negative aspects of the SWB. The
neurophysiological, social and interactional benefits of regular physical activity are already
known (Abrantes et al., 2012; Buffart et al., 2012; Edenfield & Saeed, 2012). These benefits
are also maintained during a social isolation situation, as experienced in the pandemic period
of Covid-19, especially when we take into consideration the mood factor. However, SWB as
measured by PANAS is only associated whenever the person actually experiences either the
subjective feeling of happiness and physical disposition after exercising or any negative
effects of exercising. For those people who do not feel any changes after exercising, the
SWB will remain unaltered.
Another dimension of the PAWEC, exercise effects, also showed significant
relationship with both positive and negative affects of the SWB. The literature has shown
previously that exercising leads to improving well-being and mental health outcomes
(Samulski & Noce, 2000; Stuart & Nanette, 2007; Panza et al., 2019). Accordingly, feeling
better during the quarantine due to Covid-19 is something that can be linked to exercise
routine, since it prevents depression, anxiety and stress levels to increase (Filgueiras &
Stults-Kolehmainen, 2020). So, these findings corroborate with previous literature that
suggests that exercising frequently helps the positive aspects of the SWB.
Even though there are studies that highlight the relevance of individuals’ awareness
of exercise benefits to engage and endure in its practice and to improve SWB (Santos et al.,
2009), the present evidence suggests that being aware of the role of exercise does not lead to
either improvement or decrease of SWB among people in quarantine due to Covid-19.
Therefore, just saying that exercising during quarantine is important does not have any effect
on people’s well-being. Practitioners must rely on preparing exercise routines that are joyful

and ludic instead of worrying on explaining individuals the relevance of exercising, at least
in situations of social isolation.
Beyond attitude towards exercise of participants, more objective variables were
collected in the present study. Gender correlated to negative affect of the SWB. Due to the
coding (i.e., men was coded as #1 and women coded as #2) the positive linear relationship
between negative affect and gender means that women showed higher negative affect of the
SWB when compared to men. This evidence is supported by previous findings that women
suffer more anxiety, stress and depression when compared to men during quarantine due to
Covid-19 (Filgueiras & Stults-Kolehmainen, 2020), so it makes sense that women feel more
discomfort in those conditions.
Another evidence that could be expected to be found was the association between
number of days in quarantine and negative affect. The longer the quarantine, the worse are
the feelings regarding SWB. Those findings corroborate with evidence from other studies of
mental health among people in quarantine due to other epidemic conditions (Bai et al., 2004;
Hawryluck et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005). A long time of social isolation and confinement
increases the risk for mental health symptoms, thus, quarantine must be a temporary rather
than a permanent resource for avoiding contamination.
Participants answered questions regarding their frequency and type of physical
activity. Although type of exercise did not differ in the present results, two exercise-related
variables were significantly associated to SWB: frequency of exercise before the quarantine
and increase of frequency of exercise during quarantine. The literature indicates that three to
five days a week of moderate exercise increases positive affect and decreases negative affect
of the SWB (Stuart & Nanette, 2007; Buckworth & Dishman, 2002). In fact, those
participants who reported to exercise before the quarantine and kept exercising showed
higher association with positive affect of the SWB than those who did not engage in physical

activity routines before the quarantine. On the opposite side of the SWB, increasing in the
frequency of exercise was positively associated to negative affect, which means that those
who reported more exercise during quarantine felt worse than those who kept their routines.
Stuart and Nanette (2007) suggest that sudden increases in exercise routine as well as
exhaustive exercises above five days a week may lead to less SWB. What the findings from
this study support is that balance is pivotal regarding exercise routine, so, both sedentary and
exaggerate exercise behaviours may increase negative affect of one’s SWB. In this sense, a
physical activity program to introduce more benefits must be individualized and developed
by a physical education teacher who has knowledge of these training principles in order to
achieve maximum exercise performance and protect the body against harmful excesses, such
as injuries (Bessa, Silva, Carrijo, & Oliveira, 2013). Thus, people who included physical
activity practice only after quarantine may not have taken these principles into account and
this will generate feelings of discomfort.
The study by Filgueiras and Stults-Kolehmainen (2020) on mental health during
quarantine due to Covid-19 showed that sudden changes in habits during the isolation period
increases the risks for depression, anxiety and acute stress. This result corroborates with
these found in the present study. Quarantine provides people the sense of that starting regular
physical activity could contribute to their physical and mental health. However, it seems
clear that this sudden inclusion of an exercise routine, and often without prior planning, can
contribute to a greater sense of subjective malaise.
An important aspect highlighted by Becker Junior (2000) is that in order to observe
the effects of exercise and sport on the emotional area, it is necessary to respect the practice
time, varying between four and twenty weeks. The intensity with which physical exercise is
performed is also a factor, which interferes with the type of emotional response observed.
The more frequent the exercise practice, the less presence of psychological disorders and

many stressors tend to reduce their strength as the exercise habit increases (Krause et al.,
1993). Thus, the inclusion of physical activity only in the quarantine period is not associated
with greater subjective well-being. This result points out that the inclusion of healthier habits
in the social isolation period should not start with an increase in physical activity practice.
The sudden introduction of physical activity and the lack of individualized planning
lead to another issue found in this research: the relationship between SWB and the adoption
of social media and other internet resources to build exercise routines. Those who used
technological yet impersonalized applications (i.e., YouTube, Instagram and other mobile
apps) to conduct their practices of physical activity had a decrease in the positive affect of
the SWB and an increase of negative affect of the SWB. These classes of training designs do
not take into account the reality of each individual, they are generalists, and, therefore only
meet the demands of a specific group of people (Bessa et al, 2013). Although it could be
expected that those resources actually are beneficial or, at least, unassociated to SWB, in fact
they decrease positive affect and increase negative affect, which makes them not
recommended for people in quarantine due to Covid-19.
Based on the results described herein, physical activity practice during quarantine can
contribute to a greater SWB for people in quarantine due to Covid-19, but only those who
were already in the habit of exercising. Including a new habit, which requires guidance and
care during isolation, can induce increase of negative affect. In addition, indiscriminate use
of media resources to initiate practice brings greater sense of discomfort. It is important that
the practice of physical activity in a period of social isolation is designed to be closer to
previous habits; including an obligation to exercise during this period when this was not a
reality for the person can contribute to an increase in malaise. Maybe other strategies such as
investing in a balanced diet and regular feeding habits (Filgueiras & Stults-Kolehmainen,
2020), getting involved with artistic activities can be better ways to increase well-being.
