Summary. We have constructed a COVID-19 infection hazard model for the return of pupils to
the 16,769 state Primary Schools in England that takes into account uncertainties in model
input parameters. The basic probabilistic model estimates likely number of primary schools
with one or more infected persons under three different return-to-school circumstances. Inputs
to the infection hazard model are: the inventory of children, teachers and support staff; the
prevalence of COVID-19 in the general community including its spatial variation, and the ratio
of adult susceptibility to that of children. Three scenarios of inventory are: the counts on 1st
June when schools re-opened to Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children, when
approximately one-third of eligible children attended; a scenario assuming a full return of
eligible children in those cohorts; and a return of all primary age children, scheduled for
September. With a national average prevalence, we find that for the first scenario between 178
and 924 schools out of 16,769 in total (i.e. about 1% and 5.5% respectively) may have infected
individuals present, expressed as a 90% credible interval. For the second scenario, the range is
between 336 (2%) and 1873 (11%) schools with one (or more) infected persons, while for the
third scenario the range is 661 (4%) to 3310 (20%) schools, assuming that the prevalence is the
same as it was on 5th June. The range decreases to between 381 (2%) and 900 (5%) schools with
an infected person if prevalence is one-quarter that of 5th June, and increases to between 2131
(13%) and 9743 (58%) schools for the situation where prevalence increases to 4 times the 5th
June level. Net prevalence of COVID-19 in schools is reduced relative to the general community
because of the lower susceptibility of primary age children to infection. When regional
variations in prevalence and school size distribution are taken into account there is a slight
decrease in number of infected schools, but the uncertainty on these projected numbers
increases markedly. The probability of having an infected school in a community is proportional
to the local prevalence and school size. Analysis of a scenario equivalent to a full return to
school with an average national prevalence of 1 in 1700 and spatial prevalence variations,
estimated from data for late June, indicates 82% of infected schools would be located in areas
where prevalence exceeds the national average. The probability of having multiple infected
persons in a school increases markedly in high prevalence areas. Assuming national prevalence
characteristic of early June, individual, operational and societal risk will increase if schools reopen fully in September due to both increases in numbers of children and the increased
challenges of sustaining mitigation measures. Comparison between incidents in primary schools
with positive tests in June and July and our estimates of number of infected schools indicates at
least an order of magnitude difference. The much lower number of incidents reflects several
factors, including effective reduction in transmission resulting from risk mitigation measure
instigated by schools.

On 11 May 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that selected primary age children
would return to school on 1st June in England. The returning cohort would include Reception,
Year 1 and Year 6, noting that there would also be Year 2 to 5 children of frontline workers and
those identified as vulnerable who were already being taught in many schools. Nursery age
children were also invited to return with some nurseries being part of Primary schools. The
devolved administrations decided at the time not to re-open schools. The Government
abandoned the proposal for a full return of Primary school children in England before the
summer holidays. There is now an expectation that schools will fully re-open in September.

The partial re-opening of Primary schools was widely debated with concerns from some
parents, teaching unions and teacher associations about the safety of the children and school
staff. There was also concern about the effect on infection rate in the wider community, for
example by triggering a second wave. While official guidelines for re-opening schools have been
issued by the Department of Education (DfE) and form the policy basis for risk mitigation in
schools, individual schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies (Sparks et al. 2020).
Some schools re-opened on 1st June, some delayed their re-start while, in other cases, schools
did not re-open under advice of local education authorities. Data from DfE indicates on 2nd July
that about 88% of state-funded Primary Schools had re-opened to some extent. The community
response has been variable and between 1st and 15th June 2020 approximately 35% of eligible
children returned. The numbers increased somewhat: 41% (year 1) and 49% (year 6) attended
on 2nd July. Between 18th May and 31st July 2020 there have been 247 COVID-19 related
incidents in schools of which 116 were tested to be positive test (PHE 2020).

This study is part of a quantitative hazard assessment for schools with respect to COVID-19. The
study seeks to enumerate potential infection levels in primary schools, with estimates of
attendant uncertainties. The study involves building a stochastic uncertainty model of hazard
which includes information on schools and epidemiological parameters that control occurrence
and transmission of COVID-19 within schools. Much of the information is derived from national
statistics on schools and information about the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 in
England.

This study does not address the implications of opening schools for spread of the infection in
the wider community, which are being addressed by other modelling studies. Here we
distinguish between societal risk, operational risk and individual risk. The question of how
opening schools up affects the national and regional picture of infection is an example of
societal risk assessment; for example, by estimating the change in the reproduction number
(Panovska-Griffiths et al. 2020). Operational risk concerns a school identifying an infection or
the threat of an infection breakout. Mitigating steps might include asking confirmed or
suspected COVID-19 persons to self-isolate, classes to be sent home, or even schools to close
again, entirely. Individual risk concerns the probability that a child, teacher or other support

staff acquires infection as a consequence of the initially unknown presence of an infected
person in the school.
Here we have developed a model of infection hazard, which is defined as the probability of one
or more infectious person (child, teacher or support staff) being on the premises of a school on
any one day. The study uses a fast, stochastic uncertainty modelling tool (UNINET) to construct
an uncertainty model for infection hazard levels in primary schools in England. A model of
infection hazard is a necessary first step in developing a risk model which needs to include
infection transmission. The model is extended to take account of spatial variations in
prevalence to characterize infection hazard level in relation to geographical locations. Our
model is flexible and dynamic. Thus, in the future it will enable risk to be assessed for different
return-to-school scenarios, including secondary schools, for regional or local situations and
potentially for individual schools. The approach can also be modified for different kinds of
educational operation, such as Universities and Further Education colleges. The model can also
be used to estimate sampling power in schools in the context of an infection testing
programme.

Different domains of science and society use terms like hazard and risk in different ways and in
different contexts. Risk can sometimes be discussed in the context of risk mitigation and safety,
whereas in, for example, the financial sector the risk is defined as expected monetary loss. In
the health and safety context risk is the chance of harm, whereas in some natural hazard
contexts threat is used to signal the potential of harm. Exposure is sometimes used to indicate
that an asset or person is in harm’s way. Risk also pertains to different scales and kinds of loss
or harm. Risk management benefits from information on the hazard, the exposure, the
vulnerability to the hazard and its potential impact. Ultimately, quantitative risk assessment
involves calculating the probability of a loss or a harm. Here, we treat COVID-19 infection as a
hazard and the presence of infectious persons in schools as a threat that might lead to harm.

Our computational platform is the UNINET LightTwist software (https://lighttwistsoftware.com/uninet/). UNINET is a standalone uncertainty analysis software with a focus on
dependence modelling for high dimensional statistical or probability distributions (Hanea et al.
2018). The program implements and computes continuous non-parametric Bayesian Belief
Network (BBN) models as the framework for probabilistic modelling. A BBN is a graphical
model, which represents joint distributions in an intuitive and efficient way. It encodes the
probability density (or mass) function of a set of variables by specifying a number of conditional
independence statements in the form of a directed acyclic graph. The structure of the model is
specified by the analyst to incorporate all essential input variables and conditionalizing factors
that are needed to quantify the problem and to enumerate output probability distributions.
The approach is quite general and allows traceable and defensible results to be generated very
efficiently as UNINET uses unique fast Bayesian updating algorithms. One of the other main

advantages of UNINET is that it can handle a large number of continuous variables and does not
require these to be represented as discretized distributions, as in many BBN programs.

137
138
139

An added benefit is that other factors, elements and complexities can be readily added to the
BBN model formulation, for example, by including details of school characteristics or agedependent transmission rates and, perhaps most pertinently, the BBN calculations can be
quickly updated if new or revised data are forthcoming. The model can be applied at different
granularities and at a regional or local level. As we have found with volcanic eruptions, this
latter capability is invaluable for real-time forecasting applications.

The Government announcement for re-opening primary schools and nurseries on 1st June
stipulated that the returning children would be confined to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. The
pupil database for January 2019 lists numbers of children by age, which does not exactly map
onto school years. We used these data to give numbers as follows: 618,700 (Reception),
636,664 (Year 1) and 620,053 (Year 6). A small proportion of Year 2 to 5 children of emergency
workers and children from vulnerable environments are present in school. Data for daily
national attendance of pupils, teachers, teaching assistants and ancillary staff in schools can be
found at:

For epidemiological data we used a variety of sources. Prevalence data were obtained from
infection surveys published by the Office of National Statistics.

ONS state that the number of infections within the community population refers to private
residential households, but excludes those in hospitals, care homes or other institutional
settings. This measure of prevalence is suitable for our infection hazard model as those
presenting at school are not in the excluded group. However, some of these same people will
mix with family and friends in the excluded group, suggesting that the national prevalence
infection survey data are an underestimate.

191
192

Incidence data at UTLA level, to be used as a proxy for regional variations of prevalence, were
obtained from Public Health England.

Figure 1 shows the basic Bayesian Belief Network established to estimate infection hazard in
schools. Input parameters include prevalence, the susceptibility ratio of children relative to
adults in the 20 to 60 year age range, and the inventory of children and staff in Primary Schools.
Outputs include the prevalence in schools, the number of schools with one or more infected
person on a given day and how the infection is spread between different cohorts of persons
(e.g. children and adults).

BBN modelling introduced a range of random variable values for prevalence in different geographical
areas as depicted in Figure 3. Plain white nodes carry input variable uncertainty distributions, white
nodes with handles represent fixed (constant) input values. Yellow nodes are intermediate functional (i.e.
calculational) nodes. Pink nodes compute the required output variable probability distributions; some
these are also intermediate calculation steps, feeding uncertainty distributions into other output nodes.

Having an infectious person in a school poses a threat to individuals, the operation of the
school, which in extremis might have to close, and to the wider community. We term a school
of one or more infectious individual present as an “infected school.” The harm, potentially
caused by this threat, will depend on the context and a full risk assessment would involve
quantification of the probability of this harm occurring.

Scenarios and model assumptions

223
224
225
226
227

We adopt here a scenario approach in which some input parameters are either fixed or
represented by probability density functions reflecting informational uncertainty. The main
assumptions for a given scenario are the number of pupils, teachers, teaching assistants and
ancillary support staff present in schools. The scenario parameters are summarized in Table 2
and are now described.

228
229
230
231
232
233

Scenario I considers the situation on 1st June 2020, the first day of school return for selected
Year groups. Numbers of persons are obtained from the attendance data. The ONS published a
probability density function (pdf) for adult prevalence on 5th June 2020 (mean value expressed
as odds 1 in 1700) and this is used for Scenario I. Scenario II assumes attendance of all children
in the selected Year groups, adjusted for typical absenteeism (4%). Thus, Scenario II represents
the case had there been high compliance with the return to school on 1st June.

Looking forward to the full re-opening of schools in September, Scenario IIIa assumes the
return of all primary school children in all years (adjusted for typical absentee rates). Two
additional sub-scenarios are also considered for September: one in which the adult prevalence
is 4x greater than that given in the ONS pdf from the 5th June survey (Scenario IIIb) and another
for a drop to ¼ of that prevalence (Scenario IIIc). We note here that the prevalence in early
August is 1 in 1500, remaining close to the value of 5th June. These sub-Scenarios provide two
alternative but plausible ranges of adult prevalence reflecting the future level of, and
uncertainty in, prevalence in September. The numbers of persons in each Scenario are given in
Table 2.

Footnotes:
1. The Government Web Site reports 62% returns and describes a methodology to estimate the overall attendance.
Note that some schools rationed attendance with groups of different children only attending on two days a week.
2. The numbers in Nursery have been increased by 2% to take account of children of critical workers and
vulnerable children in each year groups. This estimate is given in the government web site.
3. These number for years 2 to 5 and for scenarios are reduced by 4% from the full inventory of pupils, teachers,
teaching assistants and ancillary staff to take account of absentees.
4. The Government web site gives returning teachers, teaching assistants and ancillary staff for all schools but this
includes secondary schools. Here we take the returning staff as 53% of the reported numbers.
5. In Scenarios I and II we were unable to obtain accurate national figures for Cohorts 3 and 4 because the June
attendance information was not broken down between Primary and Secondary and seems to have included some
private sector schools. Information from the 36 primary schools in the study gave an average of 65% return of
teachers and 58% return of other staff, noting considerable variations between individual schools. Assuming the
schools in the Royal Society network are a representative sample of Primary schools in England, we estimate 235,000
teachers and teaching assistants and 70,000 ancillary staff adjusting for the fact that 8% of schools had not reopened. Teaching staff on rota during the week and part-time staff further increase the difficulty of determining
precise numbers, so we have included +/-10% uncertainty on our estimates.

An initial and relatively simple baseline problem for modelling is to estimate the number of
schools with at least one infectious pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic individual present. We
assume here that once symptoms are recognized steps will be taken to remove the individual
from the school and to identify possible contacts. A key issue here is that there is mounting
evidence that children are less susceptible to COVID-19 infection than adults. The
comprehensive modelling analysis of global data by Davies et al. (2020) led us to adopt a pdf for
the ratio of adult to children’s susceptibility with a median of 2.3 and 90% credible interval

We divided the persons into four cohorts based on the children’s Year groups and staff roles.
While a simplification, the cohorts are expected to have different contact characteristics, e.g.
with respect to interactions between children, between children and adults and between
adults. The cohorts are as follows: Cohort 1 are Nursery, Reception and Year 1 children; Cohort
2 are Years 2-6 children, noting that for Scenario 1 the Year 2-5 children are those of key
workers and from vulnerable environments; Cohort 3 are classroom teachers and teaching
assistants; Cohort 4 are non-teaching staff such as administrators, cooks, etc, who have more
limited contact with children (see Table 1).

In order to develop the basic infection hazard model to take account of regional variations of
prevalence, we used incidence data as a proxy for prevalence because there is no directly
measured prevalence data at less than national scale. To first order, prevalence can be related
to incidence since, at steady state, new infections are balanced by recovered individuals who
are no longer infectious. Thus, prevalence can be scaled from incidence data. Table 3 displays
the basis for our calibration of regional prevalence from incidence data at an Upper Tier Local
Authority (UTLA) granularity.

As with all proxies there are limitations and caveats. Incidence estimated from PCR testing will
be underestimated significantly because not all those infected are tested. Further testing is
focused more on symptomatic people so many asymptomatic persons may be missing from
incidence data. To reconcile incidence and prevalence data from mid-June, for example, it is
necessary to invoke a factor of about 6 in the under-reporting of incidence (Table 3). There will
inevitably be significant uncertainties in this factor. However, creating an informative proxy
model for regional prevalence variation does not require an accurate knowledge of how
prevalence and incidence are related because incidence varies by about three orders of

(per 100,000 people), whereas three other UTLAs reported zero incidence for the same week.

While subject to the above caveats, use of incidence as a proxy enables a simplified model of
spatial prevalence distribution to be constructed, scaled by spatial incidence distribution.
Incidence and population data from PHE and ONS were processed to create a coarsely binned
distribution of prevalence with population weights. Six bins are defined, divided by intervals of
weekly incidence per 100,000 persons: 0-0.29; 0.3-0.99; 1-2.9; 3-9.9; 10-29; 30-99; >100 (the
latter is only Leicester). Each bin represents an amalgamation of populations data and UTLA
incidence rates for the week starting 25th June 2020. Within each bin we estimated incidence
from the total number of positive tests and bin population. The error at the 95th confidence
level was calculated from the total number of positive tests sampled within each bin. Table 3
shows the data and the caption describes the basis for the model of regional prevalence.

A final embellishment added to the model explored the effects of school size distribution. Our
baseline scenarios assumed all primary schools had a mean pupil population of 282 and
averaged numbers of classroom and support staff based on the data in Table 1. The size
distribution of primary schools in England based on pupil numbers is wide and polymodal
(Figure 2).

We first present results for the distribution of infected schools for the three defined Scenarios.
Numbers of schools with one or more infected persons are listed in Table 4a and counts of
infected children, teachers and support staff, present in the national primary school system, are
given in Table 4b. Example model output distributions are shown in Figures 3a-c, illustrating
typical uncertainty spreads and some skewness in distribution shapes; long-tailed behavior, as
evinced here, could have implications for decision-making. Percentages of infected schools are
given. As expected, the relative number of schools with infected persons increases in
proportion to the increasing number of returning children and teachers.

The uncertainties are large and so only allow rather general inferences. Assuming a fixed
prevalence (5th June 2020 ONS data) under current conditions (Scenario I), a few hundred
schools are likely to be infected, while with full return (Scenario IIIa) the proportion increases
by a factor of slightly over 3.6x, in terms of mean numbers of schools involved. The increase in
number of persons between Scenario I and Scenario III (a factor of 5.6x) is greater than the
projected increase in the number of infected persons. This result is a consequence of the lower
susceptibility of children: the bulk of the increase in persons in school, between Scenario I and
Scenario III, is dominated by children, since about 65% of adult staff have already returned.

Prevalence in the community is a major factor in infection hazard. The large uncertainties in the
ONS national prevalence infection surveys make it difficult to infer trends. Prevalence has
fluctuated modestly over the last several weeks, declining through June and early July but
increasing during late July and early August at the time of writing. Thus, June 5th data appear
representative and are similar to early August. The effects of prevalence are clear from
comparing Scenarios IIIa, IIIb and IIIc (Table 4b). If continued public adherence to guidance is
maintained to September and prevalence drops to ¼ of current levels then, in terms of mean
values, approximately 2.5% of schools will have infected persons, compared to 10% at current
levels. However, a second wave, causing, say, a factor of 4 increase in prevalence, will increase
this estimate to about 30%. We stress that uncertainties are large so there is a 1 in 20 chance
that the percentages could be higher than the 95th percentile estimate reported in Table 4a (i.e.
58%). The prevalence in schools is lower than in the general community because children
dominate the school population. If the general community prevalence has a median value of 1
in 1700 then the median value of prevalence in schools is estimated as 1 in 2800 for Scenario I
and 1 in 3300 for Scenario IIIa. A major caveat, addressed below, is that prevalence may vary
considerably from region to region, or even from locality to locality, and there may be very

In the following findings, we report our results as values rounded to an appropriate number of
significant figures. Given the large uncertainties present in the results, exact values - as
provided automatically by the modelling program - can give a misleading impression of
precision and accuracy when output is reported without qualification. For brevity, we discuss
some of the results and compare Scenarios in terms of median and mean values. However, it is
essential that the large uncertainties in the model outputs are fully appreciated.

Infection hazard for a particular school is a function, inter alia, of size. The average Primary
school in England hosts about 280 children. The percentages in Table 4a can be applied to a
school of this average size to give the probability that such a school will have an infected person
on any one day. The mean odds are 1 in 40 for Scenario I and 1 in 10 for Scenario IIIa. Using
children count as an approximate proxy for school size, the mean odds of there being an
infected person present in a small rural school with 60 children would be about 1 in 190 while,
for a large urban primary school of 700 children, the corresponding probability would be 1 in
16.

The number of infected persons in Table 4b add up to a slightly larger count (by a few) than the
number of schools in Table 4a. This difference is due to a small number of schools which will
have two or more infected persons present on the same day. Conditional on at least one
infected person being present, the probability of having two or more cases in one school of
average size is approximately 0.005 (i.e. 1-in-200), while for three or more it is about 0.00015
(1-in-6667). However, these probabilities only apply to infected persons drawn at random from
the wider community, assuming average national prevalence; the risk of having multiple
infected persons in a school is developed further, below, in relation to spatial prevalence
variations. These estimates do not take account of secondary infections occurring within the
school. Our analysis also assumes that all individuals (pupils, teachers and other staff) are
independent ‘samples’ in population statistics terms, and therefore their probabilities of
infection are uncorrelated. If there were two or more siblings in one school, say, then the joint
probability of them being infected together is increased relative to two unrelated or otherwise
unconnected members of a population (see Appendix 2).

Infection hazard does not equate directly to the extent that infection might spread, but we
expect that risk of an outbreak will be proportional to infection hazard. Between 18th May and
31st July 2020 there have been 247 COVID-19 related incidents in schools of which 116 were
tested to be positive test (PHE 2020). Details about the circumstances for those that tested
positive are not accessible, but the data provide a lower bound on the number of schools with
infectious persons present. There may be a significant number of asymptomatic persons
present and it also does not follow that having an infectious person in a school will lead to an
incident leading to a test, especially in the context of stringent risk mitigation measures being
applied in primary schools. The number of schools estimated to contain an infectious person
on a given day is thus much higher than the occurrences of reported cases with positive tests.

There are many reasons why infection may not be passed on, resulting in a much reduced
frequency of outbreaks and hence lower disease incidence. The infectiousness of the particular
individual may be low and they may start feeling ill outside school hours. Infectiousness is
thought to be at a maximum just before feeling ill (He et al. 2020; Ashcroft et al. 2020) and this
heightened state might be reached also outside school hours (e.g. weekend). In contrast,
asymptomatic carriers may not be recognized at all. The risk mitigation measures to reduce

contacts between people, ensure hygiene and isolate persons who display possible COVID-19
symptoms (Sparks et al. 2020) indicate they are effective in reducing opportunities for infection
spread.

436
437
438
439

It is tempting to scale up from the schools’ actual breakout data during Scenario I to project
potential Scenario III incidents in a linear manner, using the relative exposed population ratio.
However, it seems more likely that the scaling will not be linear. In particular, risk mitigation
might be less strict and harder to maintain when many more children are back in school.

The results in Tables 4a and 4b, and discussed above, assume a constant prevalence across the
UK, but this is clearly not the case with localized hotspots, such as Leicester, Blackburn and
Bradford in July. Regional variations of prevalence in early July suggest a variation at the UTLA
(ONS upper tier local authority) scale of at least 350x. We have explored as a simple illustration
how this variation might affect the results. In the BBN, six half-log incidence bins with sampling
uncertainties are introduced, with separate contiguous weekly incidence rates, and these are
converted to equivalent prevalence distributions using a generic scaling factor (Table 3); the
prevalence values are the inverse of the odds of an infected person in a population. For each
bin we calculated from ONS data the total number of persons that tested positive in each bin to
estimate a sampling error.

452
453
454
455
456

We have modelled regional prevalence variation for a case equivalent to Scenario IIIa with a
uniform prevalence. Table 5a shows prevalence rates partitioned into six regions (Bins) with the
quantiles of the distributions ascribed to each Bin. Also shown are the relative population
weightings for each Bin. These BBN node histogram distributions are shown in Figure 4, with
means and standard deviations in the lower panels.

In terms of schools’ infection hazard results, Table 5b shows the statistical characteristics of the
estimated number of state primary schools with one or more infected persons for the Scenario
IIIa base model versus the multi-prevalence model, outlined above (see also Figure 4); the
equivalent percentages of all schools are shown in parentheses. The prevalence model with
spatial variation projects slightly reduced number of infected schools compared with the
uniform prevalence model. Estimated number of infected persons in primary schools, by pupil,
teacher or ancillary staff, for Scenario IIIa base model versus multi-prevalence model are shown
in Table 5c. In terms of mean values, the numbers are almost identical. However, the variances
on the number of schools and infected numbers of persons in the spatial model are increased
relative to the base model with more marked skewness reflected in the lower median values
compared to the uniform prevalence model.

To model the distribution of infected schools in areas of different prevalence, we individually
modelled each bin with school numbers proportioned to bin population. Table 6 shows the
results comparing the bins by number of infected schools per 100,000 people. One major and
unsurprising consequence of spatial variation of prevalence is that the number schools with

infectious individuals is strictly proportional to prevalence. The corollary of this result is a lower
mean number of schools with infection (and lower numbers of infectious pupils, teachers and
ancillaries) in areas of lower prevalence. Figure 5 displays the results as percent of infected
schools that exceed a given prevalence value. For this illustrative scenario, 82% of infected
schools are in areas of above average prevalence.

One of the consequences of high prevalence in an area is to concentrate, in that area, the
number of schools that have two more infectious persons on the same day. An approximate
measure of the number of schools that have multiple infectious persons is the difference
between the number of schools with one or more infected persons and the corresponding
infected person numbers: the excess infectious cases indicate some schools in a high
prevalence area can expect to have two or more cases at any one time. For the uniform model
(Scenario IIIa), the difference between number of schools with an infected person and number
of infected persons is 114, but for the spatial prevalence model the difference is 288. This result
is significant in that there will be almost a factor of 3 increase in risk of an outbreak in those
schools with multiple infected persons.

Effects of school size and multiple infections

539

Schools vary significantly in size (Figure 2). We expect that the probability of encountering one
or more infected persons in a school will depend on size. We therefore ran a model which
sampled from the national distribution of school sizes, rather than assuming a mean school size.
The model chosen was Scenario IIIa with spatial prevalence variation. The results are shown in
Table 5b. Including variation in school size reduces the number of infected schools from 1458
to 1405 while the uncertainty range increases slightly. The decrease is because of the higher
probability of an infectious person being encountered in a larger school. Since there is no
change in the overall number of infectious persons, the implication of a smaller mean number
of schools with infection is that there will more cases of multiple infections in some schools.

The discussion has so far focused on estimating the probabilities of encountering one or more
infected persons in school. Because there could be implications for transmissibility risk levels,
our analysis is extended to enumerate probabilities for 2, 3, 4 … N infected persons per school.
For the model including the school size distribution and regional prevalence we find mean
proportions as follows for Scenario IIIa:

By way of illustration, we contrast a small school (50 pupils; 10 teachers; 10 other staff), in an
area with the second lowest spatial mean prevalence, with a large school (900 pupils; 100
teachers; 100 other staff) in the second highest prevalence area (see Figure 3). The probability
of one infected person (pupil or adult) in the small school is 4.8x10-3, for two or more the
probability is about 1.1x10-5. In contrast, for the large school the probabilities of N infected
persons are:

For a very big primary school in a high prevalence area, there is a 40% chance of having 2 or

the school at any one time.

this expected number would be somewhat reduced by about 15% to 390 (see Table 5b). With
time the numbers of schools in which an infected person has been present will slowly grow so
an implication is that the number of schools will be much higher after a few weeks. A quite
complicated calculation would be needed to infer what numbers of primary schools could have
been infected in June and July. It would need to consider both temporal and spatial variations
of prevalence and variations of how long an individual remains infectious. A very approximate
simplified calculation, however, gives a sense of the number. If infectiousness typically lasts a
week (He et al. 2020) then for fixed prevalence and a daily rate of new infected schools of 55
per day, the total number of schools that had been infected would be about 1925.

Between 18th May and 31st July 2020, 247 COVID-19 related incidents were reported in schools,
of which 116 were tested to be positive test (PHE 2020). Even allowing for the large
uncertainties, these numbers are below our estimate of the number of infected schools.
However, it seems likely that many infections were not detected because the infected persons
were asymptomatic or developed unreported symptoms outside school hours. The low number
could also reflect incomplete testing coverage. Further, the probability of transmission could
be significantly lower than 1. We have shown elsewhere (Sparks et al, 2020) that close contacts
between persons in schools were reduced in Primary schools by between 45% and 75%,
compared to normal Pre-COVID times, while other risk mitigation measure will have reduced
transmission significantly.

Use of findings for informing policy decisions

597

The main policy implications of our preliminary infection hazard results are that in England a
few hundred primary schools were expected to have infectious individuals within them in early
June, just after re-opening. With a partial return to school, social distancing measures are
relatively easy to comply with. On this basis, for a full return to school in September, similar
numbers of schools are expected to have infectious persons present on one day, but only
provided that prevalence falls to about ¼ of the 5th June level; on the other hand, numbers can
be expected to more than triple if prevalence stays at current levels.

603
604

If a national scale second wave comes with, for example, community prevalence increasing by a
factor of 4 compared to 5th June, several thousand schools may have infectious persons
present. This despite the fact the net prevalence in schools is likely to be much lower than in
the general community because of the high proportion of persons in schools being children
with lower infection susceptibilities. Infection hazard is proportional to school size but also
depends on the relative proportion of children and adults. Social distancing measures will be
much harder to implement with a full return to school.

A model which explores the effects of spatial prevalence variations finds that schools with
infected persons are preferentially concentrated in high prevalence communities. There is an
overall slight decrease in the number of infected schools nationally. However, in high
prevalence areas there is an approximately three-fold increase in likelihood of some schools
having more than one infectious person in attendance at any one time, even without
considering the effect of siblings and transmission leading to secondary infections. Infections
will tend to be concentrated in larger schools.

In the Scenario IIIa model with regional prevalence variations, the number of infected schools
per 100,000 people varies by a factor of over 350 between the lowest and highest prevalence
areas in England at the UTLA scale. This large variation suggests a strong policy focus on
mitigating risk in high prevalence areas. In our illustrative model, 82% of infected schools are
located in areas with prevalence above the national average. One option for government or for
a local authority is to consider stricter risk management regimes in schools where and when
local incidence rates exceed a threshold. To set such a threshold on a reasoned and defensible
basis, requires a formal quantitative risk assessment, with uncertainties properly incorporated.

Our results are also consistent with the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures taken in
schools to reduce transmission. The number of incidents in schools with positive tests are less
than the number of expected schools with infectious persons present by at least an order of
magnitude. Unfortunately, interpretation of the difference is confounded by other factors (e.g.
completeness of testing and role of asymptomatics). Nonetheless the reduction of contacts
within primary schools of between 45 and 75% (Sparks et al. (2020) and instigation of other
safety measure (e.g. handwashing and fastidious cleaning) supports risk mitigation as a
significant factor.

One factor not fully explored here is the size distribution of primary schools. We have assumed
that the national size distribution applies everywhere, but this size distribution is likely to vary
at the UTLA scale across the country, depending on the character and make-up of the local
community Thus, our results can be anticipated to change somewhat when repeated at greater
granularity at Lower tier or school catchment scale, for example. A city like Leicester (a single
UTLA) could be modelled at much finer local scale to understand which individual schools
within that conurbation will have higher COVID-19 infection hazard. Our model captures the
first order picture but does not have the necessary spatial resolution to understand infection
hazard at local levels. Postcode-based incidence and prevalence data would allow modelling to
address risks at an individual school’s catchment scale.

For incidence parameter uncertainty characterization, we adopted the assumption of lognormal
distributions for the different partitions of the UTLA geographic-referenced data. As always,
there are a number of reasons for settling on one preferred distribution type or another; in
many disciplines, when treating positive real variable data, a lognormal process is regarded as
the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of several factors, which is likely to be
true with incidence/prevalence data. The lognormal has the advantage of common statistical
usage, and understanding, hence we adopted here for our initial ‘scoping’ analyses. Other
distributions (e.g. Weibull; gamma) may represent more appropriate functional forms for these
particular data when aspects like goodness-of-fit are considered. We intend to explore
alternatives objectively in follow-on work, paying attention to upper tail fitting because, in a
safety-critical risk assessment, it is there that low probability, but potentially disastrous
outcomes may reside. The likelihood of occurrence of such threats warrants enumeration as
reliably as possible, in the face of many intrinsic uncertainties.

Our BBN model, as now set up, can also be configured straightforwardly to estimate infection
risk in schools of specific sizes (i.e. small, medium or large) and for individual schools, of given
size, in areas with known, specific prevalence rates. The model can be operationalized at
national and local levels to give near real-time infection hazard informed by weekly changes of
incidence and prevalence. The model is thus suitable for decision support with regard to
management strategies at school, city, local authority and national scales, and for informing
other research programmes, e.g. infection testing in schools.

This interim report only presents the results of an initial first stage analysis. The school infection
rate estimates presented above do not include the possibility of individual schools having
sibling pupils who may be simultaneously infectious; these would need to be modelled as nonindependent cases, i.e. correlated samples, within a school population. In similar vein, there
can be a number of schools with twins or triplets in the same class; this, too, would affect
potential infection and onward transmission rates. An initial scoping exercise, however,
suggests that co-sibling infection rates are low and, as the proportion of a school pupil
population that is represented by siblings is also small, the influence of children living at the
same home address is likely to be marginal for school population infection rates.

The current model is not a direct measure of outbreak risk in schools, although we surmise the
infection hazard is strongly correlated with outbreak risk. We have noted that the central
(mean) model estimates the daily presence of a few hundred infected primary schools in
England during June. Reported incidents with associated positive tests amounted to 116. While
hypothesizing that infections are likely to have been undetected or under-reported and while
transmission has been strongly suppressed by risk mitigation measures applied in the schools,
much more work needs to be done to understand the differences. An adjunct transmission
model will need to be added to our infection hazard to characterize the probability of detected
infections outbreak, given the presence of one or more infectious individuals in a school.

Appendix 1. Stochastic Modelling and Uncertainty Analysis with UNINET

723
724
725
726
727

In the present study, we use UNINET in its basic stochastic uncertainty modelling mode, i.e. to
perform Monte Carlo re-sampling from random variables described by statistical distributions
or by uncertainties derived from expert judgement elicitation. (In this application, the program
is not used for Bayesian inference, although the model is represented by a directed acyclic
graph very similar to a Bayesian Belief Network, a BBN).

In the following simple illustrative model (Figure A1), there are two random variables, one a
Lognormal distribution, the other a Normal distribution, each with definable parameters. These
‘parent’ nodes are connected to a third ‘child’ node by influence arcs, denoting the child node
has dependencies on both parents. The child node is a functional or calculational node, that is,
it contains a formula for solving its relationship to the parents, in this case, the simple product
LogNormal * Normal.

The result of performing multiple re-sampling of the two parent node distributions and
calculating the product of these samples in the third node computes the full statistical
distribution of the product, given the uncertainties associated with the parent nodes (in this
model, 100,000 samples were used). UNINET can show graphically all node distribution shapes,
with their means and standard deviations displayed, as below, and can report more detailed
properties of the distributions, as in the lower right panel; the program can also export the
individual samples collected from the Monte Carlo re-sampling for post-processing in other
forms of analysis.

sampling iterations, the Product node computes the product of LogNormal * Normal and
creates a new distribution reporting its mean and quantiles.
The UNINET program includes implementations of several common forms of statistical
distribution, which can be uniquely parameterised, and has a full range of numerical operators
for performing stochastic calculations via functional node equations defined by the analyst. In
addition, the program has options for computing results when input variables are
conditionalized on specific point values or ranges of values. With these powerful capabilities,
UNINET provides an efficient, easily developed modelling tool for conducting sophisticated
exploratory uncertainty analysis in problems of high dimensionality.
The calculations being performed within the UNINET platform in this study would be
exceedingly simple if there were no uncertainty in the pertinent epidemiological parameters,
no spatial variations in prevalence and if all schools were exactly the same size with the same
proportions of children, teachers and other support staff. In addition, we need the total
number of schools (Ns), children (Nc) and adults (Na) in the school system. Such a simple but
unrealistic case, however, does allow the essence of the calculations to be described. For
schools of identical characteristics the number of infectious persons present in schools would
be proportional to prevalence, p, and would depend on the susceptibility ratio of the adults
relative to children, Sr. For simplicity the susceptibility of an adult is taken as 1. The number of
infectious children, Ic, and infectious adults, Ia, can then be written as:
Ia = pNa

768

Ic = pNc/Sr.

Even in this simplest of case the number of schools with an infectious person (Is) would not
necessarily equal the sum of Ia and Ic because of the possibility that, by random chance, a few
schools might have 2 or more infectious people. Thus, we could expect Is ≤ Ia + Ic. For very small
p <<1, Is ~ Ia + Ic. However, even here a computational model would need to be developed to
randomly assign infectious persons among the Ns schools and repeated calculations would
result in uncertainty for Is.
However, the key epidemiological parameters have large uncertainties, while school sizes and
relative proportions of children and adults vary. Therefore, what is required is a high
dimensional computation enabled by the UNINET platform in which the uncertainty
distributions are sampled a very large numbers of times in order to make sure that tails of the
probability density functions (pdfs) are well sampled. Just as the inputs are uncertain so are the
outputs of Is, Ia and Ic. Thus, stochastic uncertainty modelling of this kind is ubiquitous in
almost all risk-related areas of environmental sciences and in many engineering applications,
and this has been the case for several decades.
Complexity can be readily added to a BBN network. For example, school size distributions and
spatial variation in prevalence can be added to understand how infectious schools are
distributed geographically. A transmission model or a model of the presence of siblings in

Appendix 2. Effect of siblings on school infection hazard level estimates
One possible concern in relation to the occurrence of infections in schools is the role of
siblings. If a child becomes infectious and has a sibling attending the same school, there
is a significantly increased chance that the second sibling would also be infected. We
perform a simple scoping calculation to understand the potential impact of co-infected
siblings on school infection levels.
Numbers of siblings attending the same state primary school were determined by Nicole
and Rabe (2014): they reported that 435,890 siblings in the age group 4 – 16 years lived
at same address (including step- and half siblings). To put this in context, according to
2017 data in the ONS National Pupil Database, the total number of pupils aged 5 – 15
years was 7,100,054 pupils; the School Census reported 6,612,292 pupils for the same
2017 cohort. Thus, we adjust Nicole and Rabe’s number by a factor of 10/12 to align it
with the ONS age cohort. This leads to an estimated 363,242 sibling pupils in primary
schools, or 5.5% of the total number of all pupils.
If we assume an average age difference of 3 years between siblings, then approximately
half of all siblings will overlap with their other sibling in a primary school; we conclude
that about 2.8% of primary school pupils are siblings attending the same school as their
brother or sister. This means 1.4% of all pupils are one-half of a sibling pair. The
question then arises, if the probability Sibling 1 is infected is identical with community
prevalence, what is the probability Sibling 2 gets infected given their exposure is not an
independent sample from a random community process. This probability is needed to
compute the effect on infection hazard level due to having two (or more) overlapping,
correlated siblings in the same school. Thus, we need to know the likelihood that a
second sibling is infected GIVEN his/her sibling is infected.
If cross-sibling infection correlation were to approach 1, the effective prevalence rate
for second siblings will be doubled, conditional on the first infection being a random
community case. This said, if, as indicated above, only about 1.4% of all pupils are
second siblings, with elevated effective prevalence rate, a small marginal increase in
mean school infection hazard level is anticipated. Jing et al (2020) suggest sibling
infection correlation rate is only about 0.15. Even if this value understates correlated
sibling infections in British families, the “sibling effect” only impacts 95th percentile
school infection rate estimates in our study.
