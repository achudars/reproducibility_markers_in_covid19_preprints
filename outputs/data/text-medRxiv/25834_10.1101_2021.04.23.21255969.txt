Abstract
Direct contact and airborne spread are main mechanisms of transmission for SARSCoV-2, and virus can stay viable for at least 3 hours in aerosols. Initus-V system uses a Farultraviolet C (UVC) system, UVC resistant textile and googles to provide virus, bacteria and
spore free environments in hospitals, crowded public places and travel environments. Initus-V
system may help in prevention of epidemic diseases such as Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid19), influenza, treatment of airborne viral diseases and spread of hospital-borne resistant
infections.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) first appeared in December 2019 was first reported
in December 2019 and pronounced as pandemic March 11, 2020. Due to inexperience in
global pandemics Covid-19 has spread to 5.3 million confirmed cases and killed over 340,000
patients as of May 25, 2020 (1). Transmission of beta coronavirus causing COVID-19 is
through both direct contact and airborne routes (2). Due to up to survival of virus in aerosols
up to 3 hours and asymptomatic carriers new technologies are essential to prevent spread of
the disease in hospitals and public places (3). Ultraviolet (UV) light exposure is effective

against airborne viruses and low pressure mercury-vapor arc lamps and xenon lamps are
commonly used as 254nm or broad spectrum UV sources (4-6). These UV lights cannot be
used in the presence of living organisms due to serious skin and eye problems (7-10).
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is currently used in high risk settings (1113). UVGI effectively can kill different microorganisms in various settings (13-15). UV can
be used for air disinfection either as duct irradiation or upper room UVGI (UV irradiation
above people’s heads in a room). UVGI was effectively used in tuberculosis wards in the past
but it has recently become popular during Covid-19 pandemic (16,17).
There is a recent development in UVC field called far-UVC. Far-UVC light (207 to
222 nm) is a limited spectrum of UVC and is as efficient as conventional germicidal UV light
in killing microorganisms (18) and recent revealed that Far-UVC exposure do not cause skin
and eye problems as in conventional UVC (19-22). Far-UVC light can only penetrate a few
micrometers in biologic materials and startum corneum and cannot reach living human cells
in the skin or eyes, being absorbed in the skin stratum corneum or the ocular tear layer. A few
micrometer of biological penetrance is enough for killing virus and bacteria. Far-UVC has
same germicidal efficacy but without health hazards of conventional UVC (19-22). Far-UVC
light (207 or 222 nm) generated by inexpensive excimer lamps which can be deployed in
occupied public locations (23-25). Low-dose-rate far-UVC can be a good tool to prevent
spread of aeorosolized viruses in public locations (26).
Initus-V system uses a Far-UVC system, UVC resistant textile and googles to provide
virus, bacteria and spore free environments in hospitals, crowded public places and travel
environments. Initus-V system may help in prevention of epidemic diseases such as Covid-19,
influenza, treatment of airborne viral diseases and spread of hospital-borne resistant
infections.
Methods and Results
222nm UVC light source:
Initus-V’s 222nm light source was produced by Vestel Inc. (Manisa, Turkey) and
InnowayRG Inc. (Istanbul, Turkey) consists of a krypton-chloride (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp and
an optical filter with emission maximum output at wavelength 222 nm limiting the emission
wavelengths to 200-230 nm. The lamp unit consists of a lamp, air cooling fan, mirrors and a
special band-pass filter. The attached filter was used to remove almost all other wavelengths
from the spectrum except the dominant 222 nm emission wavelength. The intensity of 222 nm
light was measured using an S-172 / UIT250 accumulated UV meter (Ushio Inc.) and was
found to be maximum 2.23 uW/cm2 at center and minimum 1.34 uW/cm2 from 2.5 mt
distance (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Initus-V’s 222 nm Far-UVC light source produced by Vestel and InnowayRg Inc.
Daily allowable 222nm UVC radiation limits:
The limit for people exposed to 222 nm wavelength UVC in the 8-hour period
determined by International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection) (ICNIRP) is
approximately 22 mJ / cm2 (27).

Textile Fabric used in Initus-V system and UVC 222 nm transmittance
measurements:
We measured by Mettler Toledo UV7 spectrophotometer device 222 nm wavelength
transmittance of the textile fabric used in Initus-V overalls and it was 1.5% on avarage.
Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) is an indicator of how much UV radiation (both UVB and
UVA) a fabric allows to reach your skin. UPF 50 fabric blocks 98 percent of the sun's rays
and allows two (1/50) percent to penetrate, thus significantly reducing your exposure risk
Textile fabric used in Initus-V system is in the UPF 50+ class (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Initus-V textile fabric overall 222nm wavelength transmittance measurements by
Mettler Toledo UV7 spectrophotometer
Installation of Initus-V 222nm UVC source in the working environment and
calculations of UVC to be exposed:
In order for the UVC exposure of a 170 cm operator under textile fabric overalls to
remain within legal limits, Initus-V UVC sources should be placed 220 cm and above from
the ground. With a design that will remain within the daily allowable limits of 22 mj/cm2 with
1.5% textile fabric permeability to the head area, UVC irradiation can be from top or sides. It
corresponds to 22 mj/cm2 in 8 hours under the fabric and 1488 mj/cm2 on the surface of
textile fabric. These values are reached at a distance of 50 cm from Initus-V UVC source and
devices must be mounted >50 cm from nearest body part of the operator.
Operating Room/Intensive Care System setup where personnel can work inside
with an active Initus-V Far-UVC light:
In Initus-V system, 200-222nm UVC light source is used together with UVC-proof
glasses and textile fabrics while UVC is active in the environment. It is possible to get rid of
viruses, microbes, bacteria and pathogens that threaten human health by using the Initus-V
system. Despite many papers documenting safety of Far-UVC light on skin and eyes we
preferred textile and google protection to stay within regulatory limits of ICNIRP. There no
long term human studies with far-UVC technology and regulatory bodies are very hesitant to
allow use of far-UVC in the presence of living subjects in environment. Patent applications
were submitted to Turkish Patent Institute for Initus-V system and our solution provides
immediate use of Far-UVC technology without any regulatory body conflict or restriction.
Textile innovation keeps human exposure to 222 nm UVC within regulatory limits and makes
far-UVC usable in all environments without waiting for long term human studies.

Initus-V System Description with Figures:

whole body and head and zippered in the front or as poncho for easier movement and
comfort. If the patient is in the intensive care unit or operating room, it is covered with a UVC
protective cover (Figure 4,5). The operator can perform the operation while the UVC lamps
are working actively and any virus or bacteria in the environment is inactivated by UVC.

Discussion
Infection protection equipments such as protective overalls, glasses, gloves, masks
against viruses and bacteria only prevent human contact without eliminating viruses and
bacteria in the air. Initus-V system may reduce the use of protective equipment and provide a
more comfortable working environment for employees. Factories, airports, shopping malls,
schools, buses, airplanes and similar areas that cannot be used due to social distance or
infection threat may be able to reduce social distance and normalize production, working and
travel conditions with Initus-V system use. Far-UVC 200 nm light transmission from the
cornea to the lens is predicted to be essentially zero. It has been observed that 207 nm UV
light kills MRSA efficiently, but unlike conventional germicidal UV lamps, it kills very few
cells in human cells (19-22). There was no tumor induction in Xpaknockout mice and
wildtype mice by repetitive irradiation with 222nm UVC, using a tumor producing
protocol which was shown to produce tumor when irradiated with broadband UVB (23)
In a three-dimensional human skin model, 207-nm UV light produced virtually no
mutagenic UV-associated DNA lesions, unlike significant side effects caused by a traditional
germicidal UV lamp (24,25). In this way, UVC sterilization is aimed without harming human
health when there are people in the environment.
In a previous study effect of exposure of the skin to UV radiation of wavelength 222
nm using a device that is used to sterilize equipment (Sterilray™ Health Environment
Innovations, Dover, New Hampshire, USA) was assessed by induction of skin erythema and
induction of cyclopyrimidine dimers (CPD) in skin biopsies. Study found that not only is
erythema inducible using the UVC emitting Sterilray, but also that DNA damage in the form
of the skin cancer– associated CPDs, has also been induced. These events are occurring at
Sterilray dosage levels below the threshold for bacteriostatic/bacteriocidal effects suggesting
that frequent, several times daily, use of Sterilray irradiation is unlikely to be tolerated as a
non-chemical antiseptic for human skin (28).
A recent paper revealed that viable SARS-CoV-2 can be present in aerosols generated
by a Covid-19 patient in a hospital room in the absence of an aerosol-generating procedure,
and can thus serve as a source for transmission of the virus in this setting (29). Air samples
were collected in a room that was part of a designated Covid-19 ward. The room had six air

changes per hour and the exhaust air underwent triple filter treatment, coil condensation (to
remove moisture), and UV-C irradiation prior to recycling 90% of the treated air back to the
room. The air-samplers were stationed from 2 to 4.8 m away from the patients. This article
suggests that despite maximum air filtering aerosol transmission is possible from a 4.8 mt
distance of a patient and Initus-V system can inactivate airborne viruses regardless of
ventilation.
Low-dose-rate far-UVC can be a good tool to prevent spread of aeorosolized viruses
in public locations but regulations about UVC exposures are very strict and using Far-UVC
with UVC resistan textile like in Initus-V seems to be only way to introduce this technology
into common public places without waiting for long term human trial results or regulatory
changes (26)
Contrary to the current technique, UVC systems with a wavelength of 200-222 nm are
low in error, do not harm human health, are easy to install, effective and not dependent on
consumables. By combining this system with clothes and covers made of UVC-proof fabric in
Initus-V, we eliminate the long-term damage hesitation and enable working under UVC light
immediately without any concern. Our recommended system includes UVC-protected
wearable fabric and clothing, patient and operating room cover, UVC-proof glasses, and
laboratory lighting in the 200-222 nm range.
