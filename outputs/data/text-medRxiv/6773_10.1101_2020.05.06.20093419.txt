Abstract
Background. Research is ongoing to identify an effective way to prevent or treat COVID-19, but
thus far these efforts have not yet identified a possible solution. Prior studies indicate the
protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health, mediated by vitamin D
synthesis. In this study, we empirically outline a negative association of UVB radiation as
measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) with the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 (COVID19 deaths).
Methods. We carry out an observational study, applying a fixed-effect log-linear regression model
to a panel dataset of 152 countries over a period of 108 days (n=6524). We use the cumulative
number of COVID-19 deaths and case-fatality rate (CFR) as the main dependent variables to test
our hypothesis and isolate UVI effect from potential confounding factors such as underlying time
trends, country-specific time-constant and time-varying factors such as weather.
Findings. After controlling for time-constant and time-varying factors, we find that a permanent
unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of
cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01] as well as a 1.0 percentage points decline in the daily
growth rates of CFR [p < 0.05]. These results represent a significant percentage reduction in terms
of the daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-11.88%) and CFR (-38.46%). Our
results are consistent across different model specifications.
Interpretation. We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths,
indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths. If confirmed
via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight
exposure or vitamin D intervention will be very attractive because it is cost-effective and widely
available.

1 Introduction
COVID-19 is causing significant economic, healthcare and social disruption globally.
However, it is not yet known how to prevent or treat COVID-19. Prior studies indicate the
protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in human health. UVB radiation exposure is
a major source of vitamin D, which increases immunity and reduces the likelihood of severe
infections and mortality.
A recent COVID-19 study indicates abnormally high case-fatality-rate (CFR) of 33.7%
among nursing home residents 1, which is consistent with the studies indicating higher
prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among them, due to lower mobility 2,3. Increasingly,
studies establish a link between vitamin D deficiency and comorbidities such as
cardiovascular disease 4, hypertension 5, obesity 2,6, type 1, and type 2 diabetes 7. This
evidence is consistent with the clinical studies in China and Italy that indicate comorbidities
such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases could be important risk factors for
critical COVID-19 cases 8–10. Epidemiology of COVID-19 provides evidence that vitamin D
might be helpful in reducing risk associated with COVID-19 deaths11,12. If such a link is true,
then it will be cost-effective to mitigate COVID-19 via sensible exposure to sunlight or via
vitamin D nutritional intervention. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, so far, no empirical
study has used data across many countries to explore the association between UVB radiation
as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) and the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19
(COVID-19 deaths).
The aim of this study is therefore to examine the relation of UVB radiation, as measured
by ultraviolet index (UVI), with the number of COVID-19-deaths. The results of our study
demonstrate that a one-unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline
in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths. The robustness checks show similar

effect of UVI on case fatality rate (effect size: -0.010) and the results are consistent across a
variety of different model specifications (effect size: -0.006 to -0.012).
A major threat to identifying the effect of UVB with the number of COVID-19 deaths is
the presence of time trends, which could affect UVI as well as the number of COVID-19
deaths. For example, many countries affected by COVID-19 are in the northern hemisphere
leading to a natural phenomenon that UVI increases over time. In addition, growth rates of the
cumulated COVID-19 deaths are decreasing over time. This negative correlation between
UVI and the cumulated COVID-19 deaths due to time is the source of the identification
problem. We address this problem through our statistical analysis in which we flexibly isolate
UVI from linear or non-linear time trends which can be either similar across countries or even
country-specific.

2 Importance of UVB Radiation for Human Health
Prior studies find that UVB radiation plays a protective role in human health because it
reduces the severity of immune diseases 13, reduces the risk of getting cancer - e.g., prostate
cancer 14 and dying from cancer 15,16 and may reduce the prevalence of hypertension17.
Humans receive vitamin D either from their diet (natural food, fortified food or
supplements) or from skin synthesis by solar UVB radiation exposure 18. In general, skin
synthesis is the major source of vitamin D 19,20, as the dietary intake is usually insufficient 21.
Various studies consider that UVB exposure twice a week is sufficient to maintain vitamin D
levels 21 and vitamin D once produced can be stored in body fat and can be utilized later21,
indicating a lagged effect of UVB.
UVB radiation shows significant variation according to latitude, seasons and time of the
day. Specifically, during winter months in northern latitudes (e.g., above 35o latitude Oklahoma - US), the ozone absorbs most of the UVB22, leading to reduced likelihood of UVB
radiation exposure and thereby insufficient vitamin D synthesis as indicated in Figure 1.

Other weather factors such as cloud cover, precipitation, visibility and temperature influence
the likelihood of exposure to UVB radiation and thereby vitamin D deficiency due to reduced
skin synthesis. For example, clouds not only reduce the amount of UVB radiation but also the
likelihood of UVB radiation exposure as people are more likely to undertake outdoor
activities on less cloudy days. Lifestyle and mobility also influences the likelihood of UVB
radiation exposure 3,23,24. Similarly, the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency also increases with
age 21, skin pigmentation 25 and obesity due to reduced skin synthesis 26.

COVID-19 Deaths Mediated by Vitamin D Synthesis & Deficiency

In Figure 1, we summarize these different factors explaining the potential protective role
of UVB radiation in reducing COVID-19 deaths, mediated by vitamin D synthesis and
deficiency. Since UVB radiation exposure is a major source of vitamin D, an increase in the

likelihood of skin exposure to UVB radiation increases vitamin D synthesis, thereby reducing
the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency. Therefore, different time varying and time-constant
factors influencing the UVB radiation variation and exposure also influence the likelihood of
vitamin D synthesis and thereby deficiency. Prior studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency
increases the likelihood of weakened immune response 18,27,28, infectious diseases in the upper
respiratory tract 21,29,30 and the severity as well as mortality in critically ill patients 31.
Therefore, we expect that an increased skin synthesis of vitamin D due to increased UVB
radiation increases the likelihood of immunity and reduces the likelihood of severe infections,
thereby reducing the critical COVID-19 cases. Thus, we anticipate that an increase in UVB
radiation as measured by ultraviolet index (UVI) relates to a reduction of the number of
COVID-19 deaths.

3 Methods
3.1 Description of Data
In order to identify the relation of UVB radiation and COVID-19 deaths, we constructed
the dataset outlined in Table 1. We collected data covering 108 days from 22 January 2020
until 8 May 2020 across 183 countries of which 158 reported COVID-19 deaths prior to 8
May 2020 and of which 152 reported more than 20 COVID-19 infections prior to 8 May
2020. We focus on those 152 countries to ensure that the results are not biased by countries
that are at a very early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, which would limit data points with
respect to COVID-19 deaths. In addition, we drop the first 20 daily observations of every
country after that country reported the first COVID-19 infection to further ensure that results
are not biased by the observations at the very early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The corresponding country level data consist of the cumulative daily COVID-19 deaths
and infections, the daily ultraviolet index (UVI), which is closely connected to the daily UVB

We present descriptive statistics of the dataset in Table 2. As of 8th of May, the cumulative
COVID-19 deaths of these 152 countries were on average 1,808 and the growth rate of
COVID-19 deaths on May 8 was on average 2.6% as compared to the average growth rate of
COVID-19 deaths across countries and time which was 10.1%. The cumulative COVID-19
infections were on average 25.888. The case-fatality-rate (CFR), as measured by the
cumulative COVID-19 deaths divided by the cumulative COVID-19 infections per country,
was on average 4.3%. The growth rate of CFR on May 8 was on average -1.1% as compared
to the growth rate of CFR across countries and time which was 2.6%. We use cumulative
COVID-19 deaths as the main dependent variable to test our hypothesis linking UVB
radiation to COVID-19 deaths and use the CFR to test the consistency of our results. On
average, the first reported COVID-19 infection in each country happened 68.15 days before 8
May 2020. UVI is on average 6.81 representing a moderate to high risk of harm from
unprotected sun exposure.

The graph on the bottom of Figure 2 shows the daily growth rates and daily UVI for Italy
as well as the UVI values lagged by one, two, three, four and five weeks respectively. It is
important to consider the lagged effect of UVI because synthesized vitamin D is cumulative
and can be stored in body fat to be used later21. Therefore, it seems more plausible that an

increase of UVI today will continue to support an individual’s immunity later i.e., two- or
more weeks’ time. Furthermore, the likelihood of skin synthesis is low in severely infected
people, while they are hospitalized, indicating the importance of lagged UVI values.
It is evident that the growth rates slow down over time, as counter-measures imposed by
governments take effect, which results in lower infection rates and lower mortality rates. At
the same time, the UVI is increasing due to seasonal changes in the northern hemisphere
countries. In order to approximate the association of UVI, we need to isolate it from the
underlying time-trends, which are potentially affecting both UVI as well as the growth rates
of cumulative COVID-19 deaths.

4 Results
We estimate the effect of UVI on the cumulative COVID-19 deaths by using log-linear
fixed-effects regression. The effect of UVI is isolated from time-constant country-specific
factors (see Figure 1) by using a within-transformation of the transformed structural model as
outlined in equation (1) in Supplementary Appendix. Further, we use the partialling-out
property to isolate the effect of UVI from all linear as well as some non-linear effects of time
varying factors such as weather and time, which may confound the results. Our statistical
analysis is outlined in detail in Description of Methodology section in Supplementary
Appendix.
The key finding is the significant negative long-run association of UVI on cumulative
COVID-19 deaths. As we outline in the Identification of UVI Effect section in Supplementary
Appendix, the estimate is likely to identify an upper bound of the relation, indicating that the
association could be even stronger. Our results presented in Table 3 suggest that a permanent
unit increase of UVI is associated with a decline of 1.2 percentage points in daily growth rates
of cumulative COVID-19 deaths [p < 0.01]. Relative to the average daily growth rate of
10

cumulative COVID-19 deaths (10.1%), this decline translates into a significant percentage
change of -11.88% (=-1.2%/10.1%). We further find that a permanent unit increase of UVI is
associated with a decline of 1.0 percentage points in the daily CFR growth rate [p < 0.05].
Compared with the average daily growth rate of CFR (2.6%), this decline translates into a
significant percentage change of -38.46% (=-1.0%/2.6%).
Results indicate no significant association from an increase of UVI on cumulative
COVID-19 deaths on the same day or a week ahead. This insignificant finding is consistent
with the fact that severely infected people are more likely to be hospitalized and therefore less
likely to be exposed to UVB radiation during their hospital stay. We further recognize that
UVB radiation may not make a real difference, when someone is already severely infected
and developed severe complications. The results also show that UVI has a stronger relation to
COVID-19 deaths than CFR. We anticipate that the weaker association with CFR is plausible
as UVI helps in vitamin D synthesis, making the infection less severe due to increased
immunity, thereby prompting fewer people to take the test.
The results of the robustness checks presented in Table 2 and Table S3 (Robustness
Checks section in Supplementary Appendix) suggest that the relation of UVI on cumulative
COVID-19 deaths is consistent (-0.006 – -0.012) across different model specifications which
isolate the association of UVI from underlying time trends in flexible ways. In fact, the most
flexible model - Model 8 of Table S3 (Robustness Checks section in Supplementary
Appendix) - reveals substantial and significant evidence of the UVI relation with cumulative
COVID-19 deaths (-0.008, p < 0.05). A decline of 1.2 percentage points in daily growth rates
of cumulative COVID-19 deaths has significant long-run effects on the cumulative COVID19 deaths as outlined in Figure 3. In order to simulate the long-run effects, we take the
average number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths across all 152 countries as of May 8, 2020,
i.e., 1,808 as cumulative COVID-19 deaths at day 0 as shown in Figure 3. A scenario with a

5 Discussion
In this study, we find evidence of the protective role of UVB radiation in reducing
COVID-19 deaths. Specifically, we find that a permanent unit increase in ultraviolet index
(UVI) is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of COVID-19
deaths [p < 0.01] as well as a 1.0 percentage points decline in the daily growth rates of CFR
[p < 0.05]. These results translate into a significant percentage reduction in terms of the daily
growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths (-11.88%) and CFR (-38.46%). Our results are
consistent across different model specifications.
We acknowledge that we may not be able to isolate the association of UVI with cumulative
COVID-19 deaths from all confounding factors. Still, we anticipate that an increased

likelihood of immunity and a reduced likelihood of infections mediated by an increased
likelihood of vitamin D synthesis may plausibly explain this finding. We also acknowledge
that we may not be able to rule out the possibility of mediation by other UVB induced
mediators – such as cis-urocanic acid, nitric oxide 13,32. Therefore, further clinical studies observational or randomized controlled trials - are required to establish the casual relationship
of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 deaths, potentially leading to a cost-effective policy
intervention for the prevention or as a therapy for COVID-19. The possibility of mitigating
COVID-19 via sensible exposure to sunlight or via vitamin D intervention seem to be very
attractive from a policy maker’s perspective because of its low cost and side effects.
Various countries are implementing lockdown as a preventive measure to mitigate COVID19 impact on healthcare system. Unfortunately, confinement at home also leads to limited
UVB exposure, possibly increasing the risk of COVID-19 deaths. While sensible exposure to
sunlight helps in synthesizing vitamin D, disproportionate exposure may also increase the risk
of sunburn and skin cancer21. Countries could create awareness among the population
regarding the importance of sensible exposure to sunlight, whilst continuing other measures
such as social distancing as well as cautioning against disproportionate exposure. If confirmed
via additional clinical studies, then countries could adopt a cost-effective vitamin D
intervention program – especially among vulnerable populations with increased risk of
vitamin D deficiency, e.g., elderly populations living in nursing homes, people with high body
mass index, dark skinned people residing in higher latitudes, people with indoor lifestyle, or
vegetarians.

13 Supplementary Appendix
13.1 Description of Methodology
We apply a fixed-effect log-linear regression model to estimate the effect of UVI on the
number of COVID-19 deaths that builds upon Figure 1 in Manuscript. A log-linear model
increases the comparability of the growth rates of COVID-19 deaths across countries because
it considers percentage rather than absolute changes over time, and percentage growth rates
are more comparable across countries than absolute ones. The model isolates the effect of
UVI from country-specific time-constant factors. These time-constant factors consist of the
countries’ latitude and diet related effects such as dietary supplements, food fortification and
diets which are rich in vitamin D. They also consist of population parameters such as how
active their people’s lifestyle and mobility are and the composition of the population with
respect to their age, skin pigmentation or obesity rates.
Furthermore, the model allows to control for an increasing pressure on the healthcare
system over time measured by the time passed by since the first reported case of COVID-19
in the specific country. Importantly, this factor would partial out any linear change of growth
rates over time that is similar across countries. Therefore, the model isolates the effect of UVI
from an exponential-shaped curve which is often observed in the cumulative COVID-19
deaths over time or in the growth rates of Figure 2 in Manuscript. The model also isolates the
effect of UVI from factors which can influence UVI or individuals’ absorption of UVB such
as precipitation index, cloud index, ozone level, visibility level, humidity level, and
temperature.
Because an increase of UVB today plausibly affects individuals two and three weeks later
we include in our model three weekly lags of UVI and of the control variables. Thus, we use
the following model to explain the number of COVID-19 deaths:

𝐷𝑖,𝑡 represents the cumulative COVID-19 deaths for country 𝑖 at time point 𝑡 (in days) and it
is related to the explanatory factors via an exponential growth model on the right-hand side of
the equation. The exponential growth model flexibly allows for different shapes of the
cumulative COVID-19 deaths. These shapes cover the one described Figure 2 in Manuscript
or often observed S-shaped curves which appear at later stages of COVID-19 outbreaks,
depending on how flexible time is allowed to enter the exponential growth model.
The exponential growth model consists of six explanatory parts.
1) 𝛾 represents the daily growth rate of COVID-19 deaths from 𝐷𝑖,𝑡−1 to 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 that is
independent of the factors presented in Figure 1 in Manuscript. 𝛾 covers virus-specific
attributes like its basic reproductive rate R0 combined with its lethality.
2) 𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 represents the 𝑈𝑉𝐼 for a country 𝑖 at day 𝑡 lagged by 𝑗 weeks. 𝛽𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 reflects
the effect of 𝑈𝑉𝐼 lagged by 𝑗 weeks.
3) 𝐶𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 stands for the set of control variables. This set consists of precipitation index,
cloud index, ozone level, visibility level, humidity level, as well as minimum and
maximum temperature for a country 𝑖 at day 𝑡 lagged by 𝑗 weeks. The vector 𝛽𝐶,𝑗
identifies the effect of these control variables lagged by 𝑗 weeks.
4) 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 stands for the time passed by since the first reported COVID-19 infection for a
country 𝑖 at day 𝑡 and 𝛽𝐹𝐼 identifies the associated effect.
5) 𝑢𝑖 represents time-constant country-specific factors influencing the growth rate of
cumulative COVID-19 deaths (e.g., diet related effects, population parameters about
their activities and demographic composition).
6) 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 consists of all the remaining factors that are not identified but also have an effect
on the cumulative COVID-19 deaths (i.e., all non-linear differences of growth rates
with respect to time and country-specific linear differences of growth rates with
respect to time. They could be caused by a decreasing number of people who could

An appropriate transformation (see Section 13.6 for the Derivation of Equation (2)) results in

𝛾 and 𝑢𝑖 do not appear in the equation anymore and a linear regression can identify all
other coefficients. Equation (2) also shows why we can only use those observations where
cumulative COVID-19 deaths are larger than zero. For example, the first COVID-19 death of
Italy was reported on 02/21/2020. Therefore, we can only include observations of Italy
starting from 02/22/2020. This condition explains the difference between the 7,471
observations of 152 countries in Table 2 and the 6,524 observations of 152 countries in Table
3 in Manuscript. We present an overview of how many observations of which country we use
in our analysis in Table S8.

13.2 Derivation of Short- and Long-Run Effects
The interpretation of the coefficients of equation (2) is percentage wise and the effect of
lagged variables can be separated into a short- and a long-run effect. For example, a one-unit
increase of 𝑈𝑉𝐼 at time s affects the cumulative COVID-19 deaths 𝐷𝑡=𝑠 via 𝛽𝑈𝑉𝐼,0 in the
short-run. After one week, the increase of 𝑈𝑉𝐼 affects 𝐷𝑡=𝑠+1 firstly via 𝐷𝑡=𝑠 and secondly
via 𝛽𝑈𝑉,1 because 𝐷𝑡=𝑠+1 = 𝐷𝑡=𝑠 𝑒 𝛽𝑈𝑉,1 (partialling out the daily growth rate 𝛾 and keeping
the control variables constant). Consequently, if the model consists of 3 lags, the long-run
effect will be reached after 3 weeks (see Table S1). Therefore, an increase of 𝑈𝑉𝐼 by one-unit
increases the cumulative COVID-19 deaths approximately by (𝛽𝑈𝑉,0 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,1 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,2 +
𝛽𝑈𝑉,3 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,4 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,5 ) × 100% percent in the long-run (the exact number is
(𝑒 (𝛽𝑈𝑉,0+𝛽𝑈𝑉,1+𝛽𝑈𝑉,2 +𝛽𝑈𝑉,3+𝛽𝑈𝑉,4 +𝛽𝑈𝑉,5 ) − 1) × 100%). In comparison, a permanent increase of

𝑈𝑉𝐼 by one-unit increases the cumulative COVID-19 deaths approximately by
(𝛽𝑈𝑉,0 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,1 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,2 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,3 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,4 + 𝛽𝑈𝑉,5 ) × 100% each day.

13.3 Identification of Effect of Ultraviolet Index (UVI)
The key assumption that is required to identify a causal effect of UVI on the cumulative
COVID-19 deaths is that 𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑠 is uncorrelated to 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 at all points in time. This means that
1) past or future unexplained parts of 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 must not affect 𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡 . These unexplained parts
would appear in 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 and be correlated with 𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑠 for some 𝑠. The key assumption requires
further, that 2) there is no factor affecting 𝐷𝑖,𝑡 which also influences 𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡 in addition to
country-specific time-constant factors or those variables which we include in the analysis.
This additional factor would appear in 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 and correlate with 𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑠 for some 𝑠. Both
requirements are always satisfied, if UVI is randomly distributed after controlling for an
appropriate set of control variables1.
The first assumption is likely satisfied because the cumulative COVID-19 deaths cannot
influence UVI. However, there have been structural changes with respect to the behavior of
individuals because the number of COVID-19 deaths likely influences them. Currently,
individuals of regions where COVID-19 is present are less likely to go outside. However,
going outside is a precondition for individuals to absorb UVB. Suppose the effect of UVI is
𝛽ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ high for the first ten observations and 𝛽𝑙𝑜𝑤 for the subsequent twenty observations,
because individuals do not go outside and absorb UVB. Then, the estimate 𝛽𝑒𝑠𝑡 recovers the
1

2

weighted average of both effects, meaning that 𝛽𝑒𝑠𝑡 = 3 𝛽ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ + 3 𝛽𝑙𝑜𝑤 , but would not be
biased due to the behavioral change.
The second assumption could be violated by changes in the growth rates of the cumulative
COVID-19 deaths with respect to countries over time. Such changes could be growth rates
which are 1) country-specific and time-constant, 2) linearly time-varying but similar across
23

countries, 3) non-linearly time-varying but similar across countries, and 4) linearly or nonlinearly time-varying and country-specific. Such changes in the growth rates threaten a causal
identification of the effect of UVI because UVI increases over time as summer is coming
closer (in the countries on the Northern hemisphere). Our main model specification isolates
the effect of UVI from changes in the growth rates of type 1) and type 2) by partialling out
any country-specific time-constant differences of growth rates and linear changes of growth
rates with respect to time that are similar across countries. In our robustness checks we
increase flexibility of the model to also capture country-specific linear differences of growth
rates with respect to time as well as some non-linear differences of growth rates with respect
to time, which are either similar across countries or even country-specific.
Cloud or precipitation index could also violate condition 2). On the one hand, a high cloud
coverage and precipitation today decrease the future number of infections because individuals
are less likely to go outside and get infected today and die in future. On the other hand, both
indices decrease UVI, because they absorb the radiation. Therefore, these two relationships
could create an upward bias in the estimate of UVI. Consequently, controlling for the cloud
and precipitation index mitigates the bias and makes a causal identification more plausible.
The air quality could violate condition 2). The decrease in traffic over time leads to an
improvement of the air quality and air quality is likely to reduce the cumulative COVID-19
deaths2. Because UVI increases over time, the air quality could be positively correlated with
UVI. These relationships could cause an upwards bias in the estimate of UVI meaning that the
true effect of UVI is lower that the estimate. Therefore, negative estimates can be considered
conservative.
A country-specific mutation of the virus over time could also violate assumption 2. If a
mutation increased the cumulative COVID-19 deaths, then it could positively correlate with
UVI due to time. This relationship would create an upward bias. Therefore, negative estimates
24

of the effect of UVI can be considered conservative. Another threat to our identification is a
potential systematic false reporting about the cumulative COVID-19 deaths. In the beginning
of the crisis it seems likely that not all deaths have been tested for COVID-19 (so that the
reported number of COVID-19 deaths is smaller than the true value) while nowadays all
deaths which are tested positively for COVID-19 are reported as a COVID-19 death, even
though not entirely caused by it (i.e., reported COVID-19 deaths is higher than true value).
This positive correlation of measurement error with time would generate an upward bias of
the estimate of the effect of UVI. Therefore, negative estimates can be considered
conservative.

13.4 Model Selection to Identify the Effect of Ultraviolet Index (UVI) on the
Cumulative COVID-19 Deaths
We estimate equation (2) up to a lag of 8 weeks and decided to choose models with 5 lags
and all control variables as presented in Table S2. On the one hand, we did not find major
changes with respect to the size and statistical significance of the estimate of UVI. On the other
hand, including more lags increases the number of estimates which decreases their accuracy
such that a more parsimonious model is favorable.

13.5 Robustness Checks
To examine the robustness of our results we change the dependent variable into the casefatality-rate (CFR). CFR is defined as the cumulative COVID-19 deaths divided by the
cumulative COVID-19 infections. Therefore, CFR of country 𝑖 day 𝑡 is calculated as CFR 𝑖,𝑡 =
𝐷𝑖,𝑡
𝐼𝑖,𝑡

, where 𝐼𝑖,𝑡 stands for the cumulative COVID-19 infections. It is a common measure to

assess the severity of diseases because a high CFR leads to a high number of cumulative
COVID-19 deaths. Its advantage to the cumulative COVID-19 deaths is that it relates the
cumulative number of deaths to the cumulative number of infections for a disease. Therefore,
it helps to isolate the effect of UVI on cumulative COVID-19 deaths from its effect on

cumulative COVID-19 infections. Provided that the cumulative COVID-19 infections follow
the same model structure as outlined in equation (2), we can express 𝐼𝑖,𝑡 via an exponential
growth model:
5

𝐼𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐼𝑖,𝑡−1 × 𝑒 𝛾𝐼+∑𝑗=0[𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑗𝛽𝐼,𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗+𝐶𝑖,𝑡−𝑗𝛽𝐼,𝐶,𝑗]+𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡𝛽𝐼,𝐹𝐼+𝑢𝐼,𝑖 +𝜖𝐼,𝑖,𝑡

(3)

The interpretation of the coefficients and variables is essentially the same as in equation
(2) but relates to the cumulative COVID-19 infections rather than deaths. Dividing equation
(1) by equation (3) leads to equation (4).
5

𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1 × 𝑒 𝛾𝐶𝐹𝑅 +∑𝑗=0[𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗+𝐶𝑖,𝑡−𝑗𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝐶,𝑗 ]+𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝐹𝐼+𝑢𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝑖 +𝜖𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝑖,𝑡

(4)

After applying the same transformation on equation (4) to derive equation (2) we get the
estimable equation (5).

(5)

𝑗=0

Every coefficient of equation (5) shows the effect of UVI or the effect of a control
variable on CFR. For example, 𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 stands for the effect of UVI lagged by 𝑗 weeks on
CFR. Moreover, 𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 reflects the difference of the effect of UVI on the cumulative
COVID-19 deaths and infections, because 𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 = 𝛽𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 − 𝛽𝐼,𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 . This relationship also
holds for 𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝐶,𝑗 and 𝛽𝐶𝐹𝑅,𝐹𝐼 .We expect to find smaller effect sizes for UVI on CFR. On the
one hand, we expect UVI to decrease the cumulative COVID-19 deaths. On the other hand,
we expect UVI to decrease the cumulative COVID-19 infections. The reason is not that fewer
people get infected but rather that the infections are less severe which makes it less likely that
people get themselves tested. One concern when using the observed case fatality rate 𝐶𝐹𝑅 𝑜𝑏𝑠
that is obtained during an epidemic, is that it likely understates the true case fatality rate
𝐶𝐹𝑅 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 . Note, however, that the model is robust to a miss-reported value of 𝐶𝐹𝑅 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 as long
as the error is multiplicative and time-constant. Suppose the observed case fatality rate

where 𝜗𝐶𝐹𝑅 represents the multiplicative and time-constant error. This relationship could
be the result of miss-reported cumulative COVID-19 deaths and infections, if there are timeconstant errors for the cumulative COVID-19 deaths and infections, because

𝐶𝐹𝑅𝑜𝑏𝑠

× 𝜗𝐶𝐹𝑅

where 𝜗𝐷 and 𝜗𝐼 represent the multiplicative and time-constant error for the cumulative
COVID-19 deaths and infections, respectively. If, for example, the true cumulative COVID19 deaths at day t are always 10% higher than the observed one, then this 10% difference
represents a multiplicative and time-constant error.
If the multiplicative errors of cumulative COVID-19 deaths and infections are not timeconstant but grow linearly over time, then the multiplicative error of CFR will still be time
constant:

where 𝜗𝐷,𝑡 and 𝜗𝐼,𝑡 represent the multiplicative error for the cumulative COVID-19 deaths
and infections, respectively, which could grow linearly over time. For example, if the true
cumulative Covid-19 deaths or infections are first underreported and later over-reported, then
𝜌𝐷 or 𝜌𝐼 will be positive and 𝜗𝐷,𝑡 as well as 𝜗𝐼,𝑡 will first be negative and later (i.e., with
larger values for 𝑡) become positive.
Despite those two forms of measurement-error outlined in equations (7) and (8), our
statistical analysis is able to identify the effect of UVI on CFR.

The four aforementioned changes in growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths with
respect to time threaten a causal identification of the effect of UVI. Therefore, in addition to
controlling for time-constant country-specific changes of growth rates as well as linear
changes of growth rates that are similar across countries, we increase the flexibility of our
main model specification. The more flexible model isolates the effect of UVI from time trends
by allowing time to affect the growth rates of all countries linearly or non-linearly in the same
or different way. Essentially, in addition to 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 we also include (𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 )2 and 𝑒 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 into the
model, and we interact each of the variables 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 , (𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 )2 and 𝑒 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 with 64 dummy variables,
one for each country, to allow for country-specific linear and non-linear time effects.

13.6 Derivation of Equation (2)
Start from equation (1).
5

𝐷𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐷𝑖,𝑡−1 × 𝑒 𝛾+∑𝑗=0[𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 +𝐶𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝐶,𝑗]+𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡𝛽𝐹𝐼+𝑢𝑖+𝜖𝑖,𝑡

(1)

Taking the natural logarithm leads to equation (1.1).

5

ln (𝐷𝑖,𝑡 ) = ln (𝐷𝑖,𝑡−1 ) + 𝛾 + ∑

[𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 + 𝐶𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝐶,𝑗 ] + 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 𝛽𝐹𝐼 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖,𝑡

(1.1)

𝑗=0

Deducting ln (𝐷𝑖,𝑡−1 ) leads to equation (1.2)
5

∆ ln(𝐷𝑖,𝑡 ) = ln(𝐷𝑖,𝑡 ) − ln(𝐷𝑖,𝑡−1 ) = 𝛾 + ∑

[𝑈𝑉𝐼𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝑈𝑉𝐼,𝑗 + 𝐶𝑖,𝑡−𝑗 𝛽𝐶,𝑗 ] + 𝐹𝐼𝑖,𝑡 𝛽𝐹𝐼 + 𝑢𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖,𝑡 (1.2)

𝑗=0

The average version of the left-hand side and right-hand side of equation (1.2) across time is
given by equation (1.3) and (1.4), respectively.

13.7 Identification of Daily Growth Rate 𝜸
Instead of demeaning equation (1) we can assume that 𝑢𝑖 is uncorrelated to all explanatory
variables such that a random effects model can be estimated. Under these more restrictive
assumptions, 𝛾 is identified. The results are provided in Table S4. The daily growth rate is
estimated to increase COVID-19 deaths by 61.98% [𝑒 0.4823 -1] each day. A robust Hausman
test to assess the plausibility of the additional assumptions required to identify 𝛾 is not
rejected. Therefore, a random effects model can be used. Nevertheless, the estimate needs to
be interpreted with caution because the magnitude lacks theoretical plausibility.

13.8 Extended Regression Results (Fixed Effects Analysis)
Table S5, S6, and S7 outline the estimation results of our main model up to 8 weeks lagged
for different sets of control variables. The estimates do not change substantially after we
include three or more lags of UVI or the control variables. We find that the model with three
lags is favorable and we use this model in our main analysis.
