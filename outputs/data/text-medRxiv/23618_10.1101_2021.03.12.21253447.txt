ABSTRACT
Background

29

Approval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 has brought hope and expectations, but not without additional

30

challenges. One central challenge is how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines. This study

31

evaluates various prioritization strategies and the efficacy of the vaccination campaign underway in the U.S.

32

Methods

33

The study develops a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under

34

various social interventions including full and partial closures, isolation and quarantine, use of face mask and

35

contact tracing, and vaccination. The model is populated with demographic and societal data for an urban

36

community in the U.S. with 2.8 million residents as well as viral parameters. The model tracks daily numbers of

37

infected, hospitalized, and deaths for all census age-groups. Model is calibrated using parameters for viral

38

transmission and level of community circulation of individuals. Published data from the Florida COVID-19

39

dashboard is used to validate the model. Vaccination strategies are compared using hypothesis test for pairwise

40

comparisons.

41

Results

42

Three prioritization strategies examined are: a close variant of the CDC recommendation, an age-stratified strategy,

43

and a random strategy. The impact of vaccination is also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario. The comparison

44

shows that the ongoing campaign in the U.S. using vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna is

45

expected to 1) reduce the cumulative number of infection by 10% and 2) help the pandemic to subside below a small

46

threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month. The prioritization strategies when

47

compared with each other showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation.

48

Conclusions

49

Recent explosive growth of the number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. continues to shrink the susceptible

50

population. This, we believe, will likely limit the expected number of people that could be prevented from getting

51

infected due to vaccination. A shrinking susceptible pool may also be an attributable reason for the observed lack of

52

statistical difference among the outcomes of the prioritization strategies. However, the invariance of the strategies

53

should give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19 vaccine distribution.

INTRODUCTION

135

SARS-CoV-2 and resulting COVID-19 disease has been raging world-wide since early 2020, killing over 2.0

136

million globally and nearly 450,000 in the United States by the end of January 2021 [12]. A significant winter swell

137

in cases is underway in the U.S. despite protective measures in place such as face mask usage, limited contact

138

tracing, travel restrictions, social distancing practices, and partial community closures. To combat this, many

139

promising novel vaccines have been under development, of which two (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) have been

140

authorized for emergency use since mid-December 2020 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) [26].

141

Data from initial trials of cohorts greater than 30,000 people showed that these vaccines, given in two doses, are safe

142

and have ~95% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 [23]. Vaccine deployment in the U.S. began soon after

143

USFDA approval.

144
145

Implementing an effective vaccination campaign will be essential to dramatically reduce the infection,

146

hospitalization, and death rates, but it poses many unique challenges. Vaccine prioritization and allocation strategy

147

is at the forefront of the challenges to effectively vaccinate communities. Strategy is influenced by a number of key

148

factors: 1) limited initial vaccine supply in the months following release, 2) transmission and severity of COVID-19

149

varying by segment of the population, 3) vaccine approvals only for adults, and 4) acceptability and compliance in

150

the community for two dose vaccination [4].

151
152

U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has released an outline prioritizing healthcare personnel, first responders,

153

persons with high risk medical conditions for COVID-19, and older adults >65 years. These groups will be given

154

priority for vaccination in phase 1, defined as when vaccine supply is still limited. In phase 2 (supply increases to

155

begin to meet demand) and phase 3 (supply is greater than demand), other population groups begin to be vaccinated

156

based on age and availability [25]. Vaccine allocation structures with basic similarities and some key differences are

157

being used by countries around the world. For example, after healthcare workers, France’s vaccine allocation is

158

scheduled to include other general workers regardless of age who they have determined to be at high risk of

159

contracting and spreading the virus due to contact with the general public. This includes retail, school,

160

transportation, and hospitality staff [17]. Such differences in vaccine prioritization structures are as of yet untested

161

and warrant modeling and examination.

162
163

The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of vaccination on the pandemic via outcome measures of numbers

164

of infected, hospitalized, and dead in the months following December 15, 2020, when vaccination began in the U.S.

165

Two specific objectives of our investigation are: 1) to assess the expected impact of the vaccination program that is

166

currently underway on mitigating COVID-19, and 2) to inform public health officials on the comparative benefits, if

167

any, of the different vaccine prioritization strategies. We conduct our investigation by using our agent-based (AB)

168

simulation model for COVID-19 that was presented recently in [19]. We first extended calibration of our model till

169

December 30, 2020 to ensure that our model appropriately tracks the explosive increase in cases that started with the

170

onset of winter and the year-end holiday period. We then enhanced the model by adding a framework for

171

vaccination. This included: vaccination priorities for people based on attributes including profession and age, use of

172

two different vaccines by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna with their contracted quantities and approximate delivery

173

timelines, acceptability of vaccines to prioritized cohorts (approximately 60% based on national survey data [3,18]),

174

transition period between each priority group, vaccination rate, and immunity growth for vaccinated starting with the

175

first dose.

176
177

As in [19], we implement our calibrated AB model, augmented with vaccination, for Miami-Dade County of the

178

U.S. with 2.8 million population, which has been an epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S. We conduct our

179

investigation by implementing four different strategies (including no vaccination) and obtaining the corresponding

180

numbers of total infections, reported infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. We compare and contrast the numbers

181

to assess vaccination efficacy and relative performances of the priority strategies. The vaccination strategies that we

182

investigate are a close variant of the CDC recommended strategy, an age-stratified strategy, and finally a random

183

strategy. We make a number of key observations from the results, which we believe will help public health officials

184

around the world to choose effective vaccine prioritization strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19.

187

Vaccine prioritization and allocation are among the key challenges to strategically vaccinate communities during a

188

pandemic outbreak. On a global scale, equitable and ethical distribution of vaccines for all (low, medium, and high-

189

income) countries is an important question. As the world leader in promoting global health, WHO released an

190

evidence-based framework for vaccine-specific recommendations [24]. WHO proposed vaccine prioritization for

191

three potential scenarios of transmission: community transmission, sporadic cases or cluster of cases, and no cases.

192

Each scenario has three stages and focuses on different risk groups. COVID-19 pandemic resembles “community

193

transmission.” For this, the first stage focuses on healthcare workers and older adults with highest risk; second stage

194

continues the focus on older adults and people with comorbidities, sociodemographic groups, and educational staff;

195

and the third stage focuses on essential workers and social/employment groups unable to physically distance

196

themselves.

197

National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAESM) developed a more comprehensive phased

198

framework for equitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccine [29]. The first phase prioritizes healthcare workers and

199

first responders, people with high risk comorbidities, and older adults in overcrowded living conditions; second

200

phase focuses on K-12 school staff and child care workers, essential workers, people with moderate risk

201

comorbidities, people living in shelters, physically and mentally disabled people and staff that provide care,

202

employment settings where social distancing is not possible, and remaining older adults; third phase prioritizes

203

young adults, children, and workers; and fourth phase includes everyone else. No specific studies have yet been

204

presented to the literature that evaluate the efficacy of the proposed vaccination priorities for mitigating COVID-19.

205

A number of studies can be found in the literature on vaccination strategies for controlling outbreaks of other

206

viruses. The work presented in [8] analyzes the effect of both CDC guided targeted vaccination strategy as well as a

207

mass vaccination strategy for seasonal Influenza outbreaks in the U.S. The study found that a mass vaccination

208

policy reaped the most benefits both in terms of cost and quality-of-life years (QALYs) lost. Authors in [15] use a

209

genetic algorithm to find optimal vaccine distribution strategies that minimize illness and death for influenza

210

pandemics with age specific attack rates similar to the 1957–1958 A(H2N2) Asian influenza pandemic and the

211

1968–1969 A(H3N2) Hong Kong influenza pandemic. They consider coverage percentage under varying vaccine

212

availability and develop an optimal vaccination approach that is 84% more effective than random vaccination. A

213

study reported in [14] examined vaccination to prevent interpandemic influenza for high-risk groups and children,

214

and recommended concentrating on schoolchildren, most responsible for transmission, and then extend to high-risk

215

groups. A compartmental model in [13] was used to develop optimal strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality

216

of the H7N9 pandemic. The study found that age specific vaccination schedules had the most beneficial impact on

217

mortality.

218

It can be concluded from the above review of relevant literature that there is no ‘one size fits all’ strategy for

219

vaccination to either prevent a pandemic outbreak or mitigate one. Virus epidemiology and corresponding disease

220

characteristics, as well as the efficacy and supply of the vaccine must be considered in developing an effective

221

vaccination prioritization strategy. Our paper aims to address this need by presenting a detailed AB simulation

222

modeling approach and using it to assess efficacy of vaccine prioritization strategies for COVID-19.

223
224

METHODOLOGY

225

Published COVID-19 modeling approaches are either data-driven models, as in [2, 5, 7, 9, 20], or variants of SEIR

226

type compartmental models as in [1, 11, 16, 21, 22]. Data driven models are very well suited for understanding the

227

past progression of a pandemic and also for estimating parameters characterizing virus epidemiology. However,

228

these models offer limited ability to predict the future progression of a pandemic that is dynamically evolving with

229

regards to virus epidemiology, disease manifestations, and sociological conditions. Compartmental models, on the

230

other hand, are aggregate in nature and do not adapt well to changing dynamics of disease transmission. An AB

231

modeling approach is considered to be more suitable for a detailed accounting of individual attributes, specific

232

disease natural history, and complex social interventions [6].

233
234

We use an enhanced version of our AB simulation model that was developed to examine various social intervention

235

strategies for COVID-19 [19]. The AB simulation model replicates the dynamics of the pandemic outbreak by

236

incorporating: 1) population demography of the outbreak region for all age groups and employment categories, 2)

237

numbers, sizes, and compositions of households, schools, workplaces, and community places, 3) daily schedules for

238

people of all age groups before and during the intervention orders (e.g., stay-at-home), 4) isolation of infected and

239

quarantine of household members, 5) closure and reopening of schools, workplaces, and community places, 6)

240

compliance to isolation and quarantine requirements, 7) face mask usage, 8) contact tracing, 9) prioritization of

241

people for vaccination, 10) vaccinating those willing to receive based on supply and priority windows, 11)

242

epidemiological parameters of the virus, 12) infection spread, and 13) disease natural history. The key

243

epidemiological parameters include: disease natural history with average lengths of latent, incubation, symptomatic,

244

and recovery periods; distribution of infectiousness; percent asymptomatic; and fatality rate.

245
246

As in the model presented in [19], each day our model tracks the following for each person: 1) hourly movements

247

and locations based on their daily schedules that depend on age, employment status, prevailing social intervention

248

orders, and quarantine/isolation status; 2) hourly contacts with other susceptible and infected; 3) vaccination status

249

and immunity, 4) force of infection accumulation; 5) start of infection; 6) visit/consult with a doctor (if symptomatic

250

and insured); 7) testing (if infected and visited/consulted a doctor or asymptomatic chosen for testing either

251

randomly or via contact tracing); 8) test reporting delay; 9) disease progression (if infected); 10) hospitalization (if

252

infected and acutely ill); and 11) recovery or death (if infected). The AB model reports daily and cumulative values

253

of actual infected, reported infections, hospitalized, and dead, for each age category. A schematic diagram depicting

254

the algorithmic sequence and parameter inputs for the AB simulation model is presented in Figure 1.

255
256

The AB simulation-based methodology is particularized using data for Miami Dade County of Florida, with 2.8

257

million population, an epicenter for COVID-19 spread in the South-Eastern United States. A step by step approach

258

for building such a model for another region can be found in [19]. The methodology begins by generating the

259

individual people according to the U.S. census data that gives population attributes including age (see Table A1 in

260

[19]) and occupational distribution (see Table A4 in [19]). Thereafter, it generates the households based on their

261

composition characterized by the number of adults and children (see Table A2 in [19]). The model also generates,

262

per census data, schools (see Table A3 in [19]) and the workplaces and other community locations (see Table A4 in

263

[19]). Each individual is assigned a household, while maintaining the average household composition, and,

264

depending on the age, either a school or a workplace (considering employment levels). A daily (hour by hour)

265

schedule is assigned to every individual, chosen from a set of alternative schedules, based on their attributes. The

266

schedules vary between weekdays and weekends and also depend on the prevailing social intervention orders (see

267

Table A5 in [19]).

272

Simulation begins on the day when one or more infected people are introduced to the region (referred to as

273

simulation day 1). Simulation model tracks hourly movements of each individual (susceptible and infected) every

274

day, and records for each susceptible the number of infected contacts and their identification at each location. Based

275

on the level of infectiousness of each infected contact (which depends on the day of his/her infectiousness period),

276

the model calculates the daily force of infection received by each susceptible from all infected contacts at all hours

277

of the day [10]. Since the exact immune response from vaccine is not known yet, we assume a linearly increasing

278

partial immunity for susceptibles after they receive the first dose, attaining full immunity after seven days after the

279

second dose; we have so far only considered vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. Following the

280

assumption made in [19], the daily force of infection is considered to accumulate. However, it is assumed that if a

281

susceptible does not gather any additional force of infection (i.e., does not come in contact with any infected) for

282

two consecutive days, the cumulative force of infection for the susceptible reduces to zero. At the end of each day,

283

the model uses cumulative force of infection to calculate the probability of infection for each susceptible. The model

284

updates the infection status of all individuals to account for new infections as well as disease progressions of

285

infected individuals. A pseudo-code in Figure 2 depicts the major elements and structure of the AB simulation

286

program.

The infected people are considered to follow a disease natural history as shown in Figure 3, parameters of which can
an

be found in Table A6 of [19]. The model assumes that the recovered cases become fully immune to further COVID-

308

19 infections. However, since this assumption is not fully supported yet by data, people recovered from COVID-19

309

are also considered candidates for vaccination. The duration and intensity of infectiousness is considered to be

310

guided by a lognormal density function (see Figure 4). The function is truncated at the average length of the

311

infectiousness period (which is considered to be 9.5 days). Asymptomatic cases are assumed to follow a similar

Equation (1) is a modified version of the force of infection equation given in [10], parameters of which can be found

322

in Table A7 of [19]. The force of infection is gathered by a susceptible individual each day from all infected contacts

323

The AB model incorporates all applicable intervention orders like stay-at-home, school and workplace closure and

reopening, isolation of symptomatic cases at home, and quarantine of household members of those who are infected.

328

The model also considers: varying levels of compliances for isolation and quarantine, lower on-site staffing levels of

329

essential work and community places during stay-at-home order, restricted daily schedule of people during various

330

social intervention periods, phased lifting of interventions, use of face masks, contact tracing with different target

levels to identify asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases, and vaccination. The timeline for social interventions

implemented in the model are summarized in Table 1. For many other salient features of our AB simulation model,

As observed in [19] , though it is implemented for a specific region, our model is quite general in its usability for

341

workplaces of various types and sizes) are curated from both national and local census records. Social interventions

342

vary from region to region and the related parameters can be easily updated. Similarly, the data related to

343

epidemiology of COVID-19 are unlikely to be significantly vary from one region to another, though some

344

adjustments of these based on population demographics may be needed.

345
346

Model Calibration

347

The AB model utilizes a large number of parameters, which are demographic, epidemiological, and social

348

intervention parameters. We kept almost all of the above parameters fixed at their respective chosen values and

349

calibrated the model by changing values for only a few. The calibrated parameters include the transmission

350

coefficients used in calculating force of infection at home, work, school, and community places (

351

choice of the values of transmission coefficients was initially guided by [10] and thereafter adjusted at different

352

points in time during the calibration period (until December 30, 2020). The only other parameters that were

353

calibrated are the number of errands in the daily schedules under various intervention conditions and the percentage

354

of workers in essential (e.g., healthcare, utility services, and grocery stores) and non-essential (e.g., offices and

355

restaurants) workplaces who physically reported to work during different intervention periods. Calibration of the

356

above parameters was done so that the daily cumulative numbers of reported infected cases from the AB simulation

357

model closely match the values published in the Florida COVID-19 dashboard until December 30, 2020. Figure 5

358

shows the daily cumulative average values (with 95% confidence intervals) for the reported infected cases,

359

hospitalizations, and deaths as obtained from the simulation model. The dotted lines represent the actual numbers

VACCINE PRIORITIZATION STRATEGIES

429

We used our AB model to examine the expected benefits of the ongoing vaccination in the U.S. using the limited

430

supply of two types of vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which currently have the emergency

431

approvals for distribution. We considered the number of vaccine doses that the two companies are contracted by the

432

U.S. government to supply, which include the initial contracts for 100 million doses from each company and the

433

more recent contract for an additional 100 million doses from Pfizer/BoiNTech. That makes it a total of 300 million

434

doses which can inoculate 150 million people, as both vaccines require two doses to be administered 21 days and 28

435

days apart, respectively for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna. To our knowledge, the total supply is being apportioned

436

among the states and the counties depending on the population. Florida has approximately 6.5% of the U.S.

437

population and the Miami Dade County has 13% of Florida’s population. Hence, we assumed that Miami Dade

438

County will receive approximately 2.54 million doses and be able to vaccinate 1.27 million people out of the total

439

2.8 million population. We also assumed that the vaccine deliveries will occur in batches starting in late December

440

2020 till late June 2021. Our study goal was to first determine the extent of reduction in the number of infections,

441

hospitalizations, and deaths that we can expect to realize from the vaccination process in comparison with if no

442

vaccines were available. Thereafter, we conducted a comparative study between three different vaccination priority

443

schemes to determine if the outcomes (number of reported cases, hospitalized, and dead) from those are statistically

444

significant.

Figure 6: Vaccine prioritization strategies examined using AB simulation model for COVID-19 in the U.S.
The priority strategies that were examined are broadly described here; a more complete description is presented in

459

Figure 6. In the absence of a declared timeline for transition of eligibility from one priority group to the next, we

460

assumed 30 days between transition. This period was extended to allow all eligible and willing to be vaccinated
d

461

when the phased vaccine supply fell short of the number of people in the eligible priority group. The first strategy
gy

462

that we implemented is a close variant of the CDC recommended strategy: Priority 1: healthcare providers and
nd

463

nursing home residents; Priority 2: first responders, educators, and people of ages 75 and over; Priority 3: people of

464

ages 65 to 74; Priority 4: people of ages 16 to 64. The CDC recommended strategy also includes in priority 3 people
ple

465

of ages 16 to 64 with specific health conditions. Since we did not track health conditions in our AB model, we

466

limited our priority 3 to people of ages 65 and above only. The second strategy that we implemented is an age--

467

stratified strategy: Priority 1: healthcare providers and nursing home residents; Priority 2: people of ages 65 and
nd

468

over; Priority 3: people of ages 55 to 64; Priority 4: people of ages 45 to 54; Priority 5: people of ages 16 to 44. The
he

469

third strategy that we implemented is a random strategy: Priority 1: healthcare providers and nursing homee

470

residents; Priority 2: all people of ages 16 and over. People with prior COVID-19 history were not excluded and
nd

471

60% of the people were considered willing to vaccinate [3, 18].

473

RESULTS

474

The strategy based on of the CDC recommendation achieves a reduction of 9%, 10%, 9%, and 11% for total

475

infected, reported cases, hospitalized, and dead, respectively, compared to the outcomes with no vaccination.

476

According to our model, with the close variant of CDC strategy the pandemic is likely to subside below a small

477

threshold (100) of new reported cases by May 16, 2021 compared to June 12, 2021 if no vaccines were available

478

(see Figure 7). Hence the likely net impact of vaccination in the urban Miami-Dade County of Florida will include

479

sparing approximately 5.6% of the population from infection and achieving normalcy about a month sooner. This

480

seemingly low impact of vaccination may be attributed to the fact that the trend of explosive growth of new cases in

481

the winter months will have significantly reduced the pool of susceptible people by late spring, possibly approaching

482

the ‘herd immunity’ state. Figure 7 presents the plots of AB model predicted outcomes for four scenarios: no

483

vaccination and the three vaccine prioritization strategies. The plots show the average cumulative cases for infected

484

(actual number of infected, which is not observed and can only be assessed through a model), reported cases,

485

hospitalizations, and deaths. As can be seen, vaccination, irrespective of the strategy for prioritization, yields a

486

significant reduction in the pandemic impact. Per our model, with no vaccination, the percentage of infected

487

population will reach nearly 61% by mid-June of 2021.

509

stratified and random strategies also yield statistically significantly lower numbers of reported cases compared to no

510

vaccination. However, comparison among the three vaccine prioritization strategies showed no significant statistical

511

difference for reported cases between strategies (p-values near 0.4). The numbers for hospitalizations and deaths

512

also had a similar trend. The model predicted values of the cumulative numbers of infected cases, reported cases,

513

hospitalized, and dead from the three policies and their 95% confidence intervals are presented in Table 2. The table

514

also provides the time frame when the pandemic falls below the threshold of 100 new reported cases. We observed

515

from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard that reported numbers of deaths are the most inconsistent of all reported data

516

due to reasons like: the timeline for deaths occurring from COVID-19 is highly variable, and deaths occur at homes,

517

hospitals, long term care facilities for which the reporting mechanism is perhaps not as streamlined. Hence, we

518

applied the percentages of deaths of those hospitalized in various age groups in the month of November 2020 to all

519

the subsequent months of our simulation study (till end of July 2021). As expected, CDC variant strategy produced

520

statistically significant lower numbers of hospitalized and deaths compared to no vaccination (p-values 0.0014 and

521

0.0015, respectively). The differences among the three vaccination strategies, however, are not statistically

522

significant (p-values range from 0.08 to 0.3).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

529

We have developed a detailed AB simulation model for mimicking the spread of COVID-19 in an urban region

530

(Miami-Dade County, Florida) of the of the U.S. The model is calibrated using transmission coefficients and daily

531

schedules of the people and validated using the data reported in the Florida COVID-19 dashboard till December 30,

532

2020 (see Figure 5). On this validated model we have incorporated the vaccination process that started in the U.S. on

533

December 15, 2020 using two different vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna with an estimated

534

2.54 million doses for Miami-Dade county to inoculate 1.27 million people on a 2 dose regimen, based on

535

government contracts at the time of study.

536
537

Model results indicate that the use of the available vaccines can reduce the spread of the virus and help the pandemic

538

to subside below a small threshold of daily new cases by mid-May 2021, approximately a month sooner than if no

539

vaccines were available. Also, the vaccination is expected to reduce number of infections by approximately 10%

540

compared to no vaccination, which translates to sparing 5.6% of the total population from being infected.

541

We note that, even though the vaccines were developed and approved for human use at a much faster rate than ever

542

accomplished before, the accelerated growth of the infections, especially with the onset of the winter in the northern

543

hemisphere, reduced the opportunities for benefits that the vaccines could have delivered. For example, by end of

544

January 2021 a large proportion (over 41%) of the Miami-Dade population is expected to be infected, significantly

545

reducing the pool of susceptible for vaccines to work on.

546
547

Another noteworthy finding of this study was that there was no statistical difference in number of reported cases

548

between vaccination prioritization strategies tested: CDC recommendation based strategy, strictly age-based

549

strategy, and random strategy. This information can help give more latitude for decision makers in COVID-19

550

vaccine distribution, as this research suggests that adhering strictly to priority groups may not be as paramount to

551

vaccination campaign success as simply distributing the vaccines.

552
553

Though our AB model is well suited to study future progression of COVID-19, it has some limitations. As

554

mentioned under vaccination strategies, our model did not include health conditions that are relevant to COVID-19

555

(like pulmonary disease, obesity, heart problems) as attributes for people. Hence, we were not able to implement one

24

556

element of the CDC recommended prioritization strategy that includes people aged 16-64 years with underlying

557

medical conditions in priority 3. Also, we did not consider any vaccine wastage due to complexities associated with

558

refrigeration, distribution, and human error. We also assumed that vaccination of all priority groups will occur

559

uniformly over the eligibility periods considered, which may not reflect the reality. Also, since, to our knowledge,

560

there is little available literature on the rate of immunity growth each day from the two dose vaccines, we assumed a

561

linear growth starting with the first dose and culminating (full immunity) seven days after the second dose. Lastly,

562

as the pandemic progresses, new strains of the virus are being identified with slightly different viral parameters that

563

may not receive full coverage from the vaccine. It is unclear how this will impact the pandemic projection presented

564

in this model, though latest research shows that those vaccinated are likely to be protected from the new strains.

565
566

Unlike highly aggregated compartmental models that are relatively easy to apply to multiple regions/countries,

567

agent-based models are highly granular and require extensive data collection for the application region. The data

568

include population in all age groups, household compositions of adults and children, essential and non-essential

569

businesses and factories of different sizes as places for employment, schools and colleges of different sizes for

570

different age groups, peoples schedule on weekdays and weekends during different social intervention phases,

571

intervention timelines, testing availability and reporting delays, quarantine, isolation, and mask usage compliance,

572

and level of contact tracing. Hence, implementing the AB model to another region is a major task (see [19] for a

573

step-by-step approach).

574
575

As vaccination is ramping up in earnest in the U.S. at the time of our study, we believe that our results will provide

576

useful information for the healthcare policy makers not only for Miami-Dade County but for similar urban regions in

577

the U.S. and perhaps elsewhere in the world with a similar demography.
