10 Abstract
11 Importance: There are growing concerns that the UK COVID-19 lockdown has reduced opportunities to maintain
12 health through physical activity, placing individuals at higher risk of chronic disease and leaving them more vulnerable
13 to severe sequelae of COVID-19.
14 Objective: To examine whether the UK’s lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts on intensity of
15 physical activity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be, at heightened risk from COVID-19.
16 Designs, Setting, Participants: UK-wide survey of adults aged over 20, data collected between 2020-04-06 and
17 2020-04-22.
18 Exposures: Self-reported doctor-diagnosed obesity, hypertension, type I/II diabetes, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart
19 disease. Self-reported disabilities and depression. Sex, gender, educational qualifications, household income, caring for
20 school-age children. Narrative data on coping strategies.
21 Main Outcomes and Measures: Change in physical activity intensity after implementation of UK COVID-19 lockdown
22 (self-reported).

Results: Most (60%) participants achieved the same level of intensity of physical activity during the lockdown as before
the epidemic. Doing less intensive physical activity during the lockdown was associated with obesity (OR 1.21, 95% CI
1.02-1.41), hypertension (OR 1.52, 1.33-1.71), lung disease (OR 1.31,1.13-1.49), depression (OR 2.02, 1.82-2.22) and
disability (OR 2.34, 1.99-2.69). Participants who reduced their physical activity intensity also had higher odds of being
female, living alone or having no garden, and more commonly expressed sentiments about personal or household risks
in narratives on coping.

32

Conclusions and relevance: Groups who reduced physical activity intensity included disproportionate numbers of
people with either heightened objective clinical risks or greater tendency to express subjective perceptions of risk.
Policy on exercise for health during lockdowns should include strategies to facilitate health promoting levels of physical
activity in vulnerable groups, including those with both objective and subjective risks.

Introduction

34

The pandemic spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] was

35

declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organisation on

36

30 January 2020 [2] and by the end of April 2020 the virus had infected more than 3 million people

37

worldwide, causing more than 200,000 deaths [3]. In order to limit the spread of COVID-19,

38

governments across the globe imposed varying degrees of social distancing advice and nationwide

39

lockdowns. On 23 March 2020 the UK government enacted measures that were included in the

40

Coronavirus Act 2020 and recommended that everyone must stay in their homes unless (i)

41

shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, (ii) requiring medical assistance, (iii) caring for

42

vulnerable people, (iv) travelling to and from work if absolutely necessary and (v) to carry out one

43

form of exercise (e.g: walking, running, cycling) each day, either alone or with people who live

44

together. Some adults aged 70 and over and those with specific underlying health conditions

45

including asthma, heart disease, diabetes and being seriously overweight were also advised to

46

follow much stricter social isolation recommendations. In this paper we refer to the combined

47

package of measures as ‘lockdown’.

48

There have been growing concerns that the limitations lockdown has placed on opportunities for

49

individuals to be physically active could have public health implications [4,5]. The tradeoff between

50

protection from COVID-19 and increased risk of inactivity presents already vulnerable populations

51

with a potential “no-win” situation; for instance where the consequence of protection from

52

acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection is increased inactivity, which could put these same individuals at

53

heightened risk of mental health problems [6], chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease,

54

stroke [7,8] and premature mortality [9]. Longer term, it is therefore also possible that because of

55

lockdown-associated increases in underlying health conditions [10], the effects of changes in

56

physical activity (PA) during lockdown could actually serve to increase the size of the population

57

that is vulnerable to severe complications from COVID-19 in subsequent epidemic waves. Reduced

58

PA may also have a negative impact on the control of chronic health problems including metabolic,

59

cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, pulmonary and psychiatric conditions; all of which are often better

60

controlled when PA is included as part of the management plan [11]. These effects could

61

potentially add additional pressure to the health system during the current or later epidemic

62

waves.

63

The WHO and UK guidelines on PA for adults recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate PA, 75

64

minutes of vigorous PA, or some equivalent combination of the two per week [12]. Newly revised

65

guidelines by the UK Chief Medical Officers also emphasised that some PA is better than none and

66

that even light activity brings some health benefits compared to being inactive, especially in the

67

case of older adults who are more likely to live with chronic health conditions [13].

68

In this study we identify whether the UK’s lockdown measures have had disproportionate impacts

69

on PA intensity in groups who are, or who perceive themselves to be at risk of worse outcomes of

70

COVID-19 disease. This study takes the form of a UK-wide survey of adults aged over 20.

Methods

72 Online Survey
73

Anonymous survey data were collected online between 2020-04-06 and 2020-04-22, roughly

74

mapping to weeks 3-5 of the lockdown in the UK. The survey included 49 questions which covered

75

a broad range of topics including (1) Demographics, (2) Health and Health Behaviours, (3)

76

Adherence to COVID-19 Control measures, (4) Information sources used to learn about COVID-19,

77

(5) Trust in various information sources, government and government decision-making, (6)

78

Rumours and misinformation, (7) Contact & Communication during COVID-19 and (8) Fear and

79

Isolation.

80

The survey was publicised using a ‘daisy-chaining’ approach in which respondents were asked to

81

share and to encourage onward sharing of the survey’s Uniform Resource Locator (URL) among

82

friends & colleagues. The study team directly targeted a number of faith institutions, schools and

83

special interest groups and also used Facebook’s premium “Boost Post” feature. A “boosted” post

84

functions as an advert which can be targeted at specific demographics. We boosted details of the

85

survey and it’s URL to a target audience of 113,280 Facebook users aged 13-65+ years and living in

86

England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Participants were also provided with URL links to a

87

set of freely available summary reports and analyses which were periodically updated in near-real

88

time.

89

We used an ODK XForm (https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/) deployed on Enketo smart paper

90

(https://enketo.org/) via ODK Aggregate v.2.0.3 (https://github.com/getodk/aggregate). Form level

91

encryption and end-to-end encryption of data transfer were implemented on all submissions.

92 Disability and classification of health conditions
93

Participants were assessed for disability by asking about difficulties in six activities of daily living

94

(ADLs) [14] including bathing, dressing, walking across a room, eating (such as cutting up food),

95

getting in and out of bed, and using the toilet (including getting up and down). Disability was

96

defined by the presence of at least one ADL. We also explored depressive symptomatology with

97

the question “In the past two weeks, how often have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?”.

98

Options were “not at all”, “several days”, “more than half the days” and “every day”. Participants

99

were classified as currently depressed if they reported feeling this way either “more than half the

100

days” or “every day”. To determine whether patients had any previous or current chronic

101

disease(s) diagnosis (CDD), participants were asked “Has a doctor ever diagnosed you with any of

102

the following?”. The question allowed for multiple chronic diseases to be selected from a list that

103

included diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2, lung disease, cancer, stroke, heart disease, high blood

104

pressure (hypertension) and obesity.

105

We additionally asked participants to provide (in narrative text form) details about any other

106

medical conditions that they felt would increase their risk of getting seriously ill if they were to

107

catch coronavirus. We chose to recode any participant who mentioned asthma as having a lung

108

disease because the topic of “Asthma” accounted for around 25% of the open text responses to

109

this question (Determined by structural text modelling, see below) and because asthma was

110

mentioned directly by 678 participants (Supplementary Figure S1) . The majority of people who

111

reported having a doctor’s diagnosis of lung disease also mentioned asthma (63.4%, n = 225,

112

Supplementary Table S1) suggesting that they operationalised asthma as a lung disease and may

113

have been referring to asthma when they reported their prior diagnosis of lung disease. 8.3% (n =

114

453) of people who did not report having ‘lung disease’ did however mention asthma in the free

115

text.

116 Analysis
117

We performed a complete case analysis of male and female gendered participants aged 20 years

118

and over, opting to include only participants who had provided responses to all the relevant fields

119

including baseline PA, PA during lockdown, highest educational qualifications, age (20-34; 35-54;

120

55-69; 70+), gender, whether living alone, household income, presence of ADLs, self-rated

121

depression and pre-existing chronic diseases. Pearson’s

122

with statistically significant differences between the groups when the data were grouped according

123

to baseline (pre-COVID-19) PA levels. Due to significant differences according to baseline PA, all

124

further analyses were corrected for baseline PA. The main response variable for statistical

125

association tests was any change in PA intensity from pre-COVID-19 lockdown to the time of survey

126

participation. This value was calculated by comparing baseline PA (“Before the outbreak began,

127

what type of exercise did you regularly do?”, options “None”, “Mild [e.g. walking short distances,

128

doing DIY etc.]”, “Moderate [e.g. A gentle workout, Digging the garden, Dancing]” & “Vigorous

129

[e.g. Running/Jogging/Hiking, Cycling, Weightlifting]”) to PA during COVID-19 lockdown (“What

130

type of exercise are you doing now?”, options as for baseline). Participants were classified as doing

131

the “Same”, “Less” or “More” than their usual PA intensity. Using the ‘nnet’ R package, we applied

132

a multinomial log-linear model via neural networks [15] to the detection of factors which were

133

associated with change in PA intensity during lockdown.

134 Topic Modelling
135

We used Structural Text Modelling (STM) [16] to identify key topics in the data on self-perceived

136

medical risk factors (see above), and also to determine whether changes in PA intensity were

137

associated with participants’ other perceptions of risk from COVID-19. STM employs machine

138

learning (ML) approaches to explore open ended survey questions in a highly structured and

139

reproducible way [16]. The goal of STM is to identify topics and perspectives in free-text data, for

140

instance by highlighting specific diseases, themes or perspectives being reported in the survey. This

141

is functionally analogous and equivalent in results to the type of human coding of text data

142

performed by anthropologists and ethnographers; but unlike more conventional topic modelling,

143

STM makes it possible to link topic models to metadata and quantitative data in a way that is

144

directly amenable to statistical modelling [16,17]. All STM was performed using the ‘stm’ package

145

[17] for R. STM was applied to data from the open ended survey question “On 23rd March 2020,

146

the Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a complete lockdown in the UK. Tell us what you have

147

been doing to help you cope during this difficult time?”. The text data were processed into a corpus

148

and transliterated to lower-case. Numbers, common punctuation and stop-words (such as “I”,

149

“me”, “that's” and “because”) were stripped and data were trimmed to include only words which

150

appeared in 20 or more responses to the survey. The corpus was then bound to the quantitative

151

data from the survey and the STM was optimised to determine the number of topics which

152

maintained the balance between high semantic coherence (i.e. the topics were clear and

153

understandable) and exclusivity (vocabulary and themes had little cross-over between topics). The

154

topics were then labelled manually (this and defining the number of topics of interest were the

155

only subjective components of the process) by first examining the word usage within topics

156

(weighted by exclusivity) and then assessing a number of representative perspectives (quotes)

157

from each of the topics. Expected text proportions (ETP) were defined as the proportion of the

158

total corpus which related to each topic. Between-topic correlations were measured using the

159

semiparametric procedure described in the R package “huge” (High-Dimensional Undirected Graph

160

Estimation). Tests for statistical associations between the PA data set and the STM topics used

161

regressions of the STM, where the between group ETPs were the outcome variables and the survey

162

PA question data, including the change in PA intensity were the explanatory variables.

163 Patient and public involvement
164

This project uses tools and methods that have been developed as part of projects that were guided

165

from the earliest stages by patient and public involvement and stakeholders have been included in

166

all stages of the research. The open source survey software used in this study was developed in

167

collaboration with a global community of researchers, data scientists and field epidemiologists,

168

including members of the public, not-for-profit organisations and partners from low and middle

income countries. A group of around 15 lay members of the UK public, including both younger and

170

older people, were asked to test, review and recommend changes to the content of the survey

171

before it was fully deployed.

172 Ethics, Confidentiality & Participant wellbeing

173

The study was approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Observational

174

research ethics committee (Ref: 21846). All data were fully anonymous and the study team had no

175

means by which they could identify individual respondents. All participants provided consent to

176

participate in the study by ticking a box on the survey web-form. All questions in the survey were

177

optional (excepting age and number of people in the household), meaning that participants could

178

skip questions if they did not want to divulge specific data.

Results

180

The survey consisted of 9,456 participants. After filtering the data (Supplementary Table S2) to a

181

complete case analysis we retained 5,820 participants for analysis and demographic characteristics

182

of the sample are given in Table 1.

183

The majority of respondents (78%) were female and most (83%) were aged between 35 and 69

184

years. There was a relatively normal distribution of household incomes but a large proportion of

185

the participants (62.9%, n = 3,659) were educated to degree level or higher. Participants lived

186

across the UK including 6% in Scotland, 5% in Wales, 1% in Northern Ireland, and of those from

187

England, 35% in London and the South-East regions. Ethnically, 95.4% of participants were white,

188

with just 3.7% being from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. 0.9% of respondents

189

opted not to reveal their ethnicity. Ethnicity was not included as a covariate in statistical analyses

190

as the numbers were too small. Similarly, non-male, non-female gendered (n = 55) participants

191

were excluded from analysis due to limited numbers. Adults were less likely to report vigorous PA

192

prior to the lockdown if they were female, older, had fewer educational qualifications, lower

193

household income, lived alone, had a garden, had school-aged children and if they had obesity,

194

hypertension, type II diabetes, lung disease, one or more ADLs and depression during the epidemic

195

(Table 2).

196

Approximately 37% of participants (n = 2,161) reported a change in their PA behaviours during

197

lockdown, with 25.4% (n = 1,479) doing less and 11.7% (n = 682) doing more than before the

198

pandemic. After correcting for baseline PA intensity, there were significantly increased odds for

199

women (compared to men) to have started doing less intense PA under lockdown (OR 1.27, 95% CI

200

1.11-1.43, p = 0.003). This was also the case for people who did not have access to a garden (OR

201

1.43, 95% CI 1.22-1.65, p = 0.001). Older people appeared to be more likely to be doing the same

202

intensity of PA during lockdown and compared to the group aged 70 and over, the 20-34 year olds

203

were significantly more likely to have changed to either less (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26-1.92, p = 0.006)

204

or more (OR 3.57, 95% CI 3.09-4.05, p = 0.0000002) intense PA. Decreasing age had a linear

205

relationship to the odds of changing PA behaviours in either direction (Figure 1).

206

Lung diseases were significantly associated with increased odds of change towards doing less

207

intense PA (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13-1.49, p = 0.003), which still held true in a sensitivity analysis when

208

we did not include the additional asthma cases in the lung disease category (OR 1.306, 95% CI

209

1.05-1.56, p = 0.04). Hypertension (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.33-1.71, p = 0.00002), depression (OR 2.02,

210

95% CI 1.82-2.22, p = 4.25 * 10-12) and disability from one or more ADLs (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.99-2.69,

211

p = 1.6 * 10-6) were all significantly associated with change towards less intense PA behaviours

212

(Table 2, Figure 1). All statistical testing used the group who had not changed PA intensity as the

213

reference group.

214

To investigate the role of self-perceived risks on PA behaviours during lockdown, we used STM to

215

reveal 10 topics in the 5506 survey responses which constituted the corpus of text on the

216

coping-strategies of the study participants. The 10 key topics we identified were (T1) "Virtual

217

Meetings/Online life", (T2) "Buying Food, Handwashing", (T3) "Key workers, NHS, essential jobs",

218

(T4) "Perceptions of risk to self or household members", (T5) "Activities around the house", (T6)

219

"Psycho-social effects of lockdown", (T7) "Playing games/Quality Time Together", (T8) "Walking as

220

part of structured routine", (T9) "Exercise & Exercise routines” and (T10) "Children/Grandchildren,

221

food & drink". Representative perspectives (in the form of quotes) from the topics are provided in

222

Supplementary Table S3. Three topics related directly to PA (T5, T8 and T9) and these PA related

223

topics accounted for around 40% of all text content in the corpus. Topic T5 ("Activities around the

224

house") appeared to encompass the kind of moderate intensity PA that takes place primarily in the

225

home and which is focussed around activities such as gardening, whilst T9 ("Exercise & Exercise

226

routine”) appeared to refer more explicitly to exercise for fitness. T8 (“Walking as part of

227

structured routine") referenced the kind of mild exercise (specifically walking) that one does in the

228

context of everyday routine such as going to the shops or work, or walking the dog. Figure 2 is a

229

correlogram for the 10 SMT topics, which highlights how participants whose responses were

230

classified as relating to topic T4 "Perceptions of risk to self or household members" were also likely

231

to feature text relating to the psycho-social effects of lockdown (T9) and what we considered to be

232

the least active of the three exercise related topics (T8). The three exercise related topics T5, T8

233

and T9 were largely exclusive, meaning that individual participant responses were unlikely to cover

234

more than just one of these topics.

235

When we performed a statistical analysis of how change in PA intensity related to coping strategies

236

during lockdown, the STM expected text proportions revealed that perceptions of risk to self or

237

household members (topic T4) were mentioned in 9.7% (9.0-10.5%) of responses from participants

238

who had changed towards less intense PA during lockdown (Figure 3) . This was significantly more

239

(p = 0.00042) than the 8.2% (7.7-8.6%) of responses linked to topic T4 in participants who were

doing the same intensity of PA. Topic T5 (Activities around the house) featured in a significantly

241

lower (p = 0.00073) proportion of responses from the reduced PA group. The ETPs for topics T6

242

(Psycho-social effects of lockdown, P = 0.0037) and T2 (Buying food, handwashing, p = 0.019) were

significantly lower in the group doing more intense PA, whilst in the same group, topic T9 (Exercise

and exercise routine, p = 0.0078) had a higher ETP. The ETP for topic 10 (children, grandchildren,

245

food & drink) were higher both for participants who changed towards more (p = 0.0268) and less

246

(p = 0.00009) intense PA.

Nodes show topics and lines show positive correlations between the topics. There was a close correlation
between topic T4 “Perceptions of risk to self or household members” and topics relating to the psycho-social
impacts of lockdown (topic T6), more gentle PA (topic T8) and challenges of daily life (topic T2). Those
whose responses were focussed towards discussion of more intense PA (topic T9) or activities (including PA)
around the house (topic T5) were less likely to also focus on T4, T6, T2 or T8. The topic correlation cutoff
was 0.01.

Participants were asked to describe their coping behaviours during the UK COVID-19 related lockdown.
Perceptions of risk to self or household members (topic T4) were mentioned in 9.7% (9.0-10.5%) of
responses from participants who had changed towards less intense PA during the lockdown. This was
significantly more (p = 0.00042) than the 8.2% (7.7-8.6%) of responses linked to T4 in participants who were
doing the same intensity of PA. Discussion of the psychosocial effects of lockdown (T6) featured in
proportionally fewer responses from people doing more intense PA (p = 0.0037).

Discussion

403

In this large UK-wide survey of adults aged 20 and over we show that the majority (~60%) of the

404

study sample succeeded in maintaining their normal PA intensity level during the study period of

405

COVID-19 lockdown. Among those who changed their PA levels, more than twice as many people

406

reduced their PA intensity as increased it. Adults who reported having a doctor’s diagnosis of

407

obesity, hypertension, lung disease (including asthma), depression or at least one ADL were more

408

likely to be doing less intensive PA compared to their activity before the epidemic. Compared to

409

the oldest age group (70+), younger age groups were significantly more likely to have changed and

410

to be doing either more, or indeed less intense PA since the lockdown began. Being female, living

411

alone or being without a garden were also associated with doing less intensive PA during the study

412

period. Importantly, we found these associations were independent from all identified

413

confounders. We also applied ML-based text mining to open ended text data about participants’

414

lockdown coping strategies and found that people who expressed sentiments about personal or

415

household risks were more likely to have exhibited a PA behaviour change towards less intense

416

activity. This is important because individual level behaviour change is guided by both subjective

417

and objective risks and because perceptions of risk may act as a conditioning factor in a

418

participant’s balancing of concerns of safety, self-isolation and health during the COVID-19

419

lockdown.

420

The strengths of this study include the large population sample of adults who provided information

421

on a wide range of demographic factors and health conditions in addition to PA behaviours before

422

and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Our mixed methods approach allowed us to capture not only

423

objective medical risks for COVID-19 from doctor diagnosed conditions, but also participants’

424

self-perceived risks which make less intensive PA more likely. We applied a recently described ML

425

approach to the codification of topics from open-ended questions, eliminating much of the

426

subjectivity that is usually associated with anthropological & ethnographic approaches to

427

text-mining. Limitations of the study do exist, particularly in that this study relied on self-reported

428

information (eg: intensity of PA, medical conditions) leaving it susceptible to response bias (e.g.

429

imprecise recall, influence of social desirability), however we minimised this where possible, for

430

instance by giving examples of different types of physical activity, with corresponding intensities

431

and asking about medical conditions that were diagnosed by a physician. Whilst the ML approach

432

we used for text mining was fully reproducible and largely autonomous, topic labels were added

433

manually and the findings of this part of the work should be interpreted with reference to the

434

perspectives presented in Supplementary Table S3. This study is observational and therefore causal

435

links between the outcomes and exposures cannot be assumed. Confounders that were not

436

included in the study or those that were misclassified may lead to residual confounding. A

437

significant limitation is that we could not assess the role of ethnicity, which is particularly

438

important because there is substantial evidence that there is a disproportionate effect of COVID-19

439

on minority ethnic groups [18,19] and because people from minority ethnic groups have worse

440

health than the overall population, especially among those over 60 [20]. The study findings are not

441

generalisable, as with many epidemiological surveys participants were disproportionately likely to

442

be highly educated, white and female.

443

The extent to which adults in the UK will revert back to their usual PA regimes once lockdown

444

measures are relaxed is unclear, but the potential for multiple lockdowns being necessary over a

445

protracted period could lead to prolonged periods of low PA in a substantial proportion of the

446

population. This is concerning because it is well established that insufficient levels of PA are

447

associated with poor mental [6] and physical [7,8] health and with premature mortality [9].

448

Furthermore, a reduction in PA levels for even short durations (for example a decrease in

449

step-counts per day for two weeks) are associated with indicators of poor health including reduced

450

insulin sensitivity, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle mass and increased central fat [21,22]. The

451

results of our current study suggest that the health of adults who have disabilities, depression,

452

obesity, hypertension and lung disease may be disproportionately impacted because they are more

453

likely to reduce the intensity of their PA. Scientists have recently published recommendations for

454

self-isolation, including that individuals should attempt to increase their PA (even if only by a little)

455

and to exercise every day in order to improve physical cardio-respiratory fitness in case they

456

contract coronavirus and become severely ill [5]. This advice may be even more pertinent for those

457

who are at higher risk of complications from underlying health conditions such as obesity and lung

458

conditions, or for those without gardens. Our findings suggest that these sub-populations are more

459

likely to be doing less than before the lockdown. New advice that promotes home-based exercises

460

such as including extra daily step counts [5] and more intensive forms of PA [23] should be

461

considered as part of any new public health guidelines for self-isolation and future lockdowns.

462

Targeting PA health messaging to address the potential harms of subjective risks may also be key,

463

given that those who have no known objective clinical risk in the current epidemic may change PA

464

behaviour in light of their perception of risk, thereby driving the development of clinical risk factors

465

and as a consequence potentially suffering more severe sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections during

466

future epidemics.

467

To date, studies examining changes in PA before and during COVID-19 lockdown are very limited in

468

number; this is the first study using data from the UK to examine changes in PA intensity during the

469

COVID-19 lockdown. The results of this study are in line with recent findings from an online survey

470

(n =1,047) of participants from across different continents, which indicate that home confinement

471

due to COVID-19 could negatively impact participation in PA such that it was associated with a 35%

472

reduction (equivalent to 2.45 days) in the number of days per week walking [24].

473

Lockdown measures due to COVID-19 are associated with a reduction in the intensity of PA in

474

adults with obesity, hypertension, lung disease, disability and depression. Participants more

475

frequently expressed sentiments and perspectives on risk to self or household members when they

476

had changed towards less intense PA. Future research questions should examine how adults with

477

and without chronic health conditions can maintain a healthy PA regime whilst adhering to

478

lockdown restrictions.

Gardening and diy have therefore become the norm.
Staying at home, working from home, doing the garden and odd jobs.
T4 : Perceptions of Risk to Self or Household Members
I’d lockdown before then as my husband suffers from Parkinson’s Disease & I wanted to protect him. I organised milk
delivery & a fortnightly supermarket delivery. I made sure I had frozen fruit & veg, pulses & nuts stocked ( we are
vegetarian). I paid a newspaper bill in advance.
Working, a lot, including caring for Covid+ patients. Then I was ordered into lockdown due to inability to care for me if
I get sick (medical conditions) which I've been struggling with as I feel I've abandoned my colleagues
I have been semi-retired for the past 2 years so already had established routines prior to lockdown. Lockdown has not
had a significant impact as I am fortunate enough to have a garden and I keep poultry
I live on a boat. I have not been out other than hospital for cancer treatment. Husband done everything. Not feeling
too isolated. Now have access to food delivery.
I am a teacher who is 9 months pregnant and I currently have an 19 month old son. I started isolating when they
classed pregnant women as vulnerable. My partner continued working as he is in the energy industry but has begun
self isolation last week as the baby is due in 1 weeks time. We have been very lucky to have such nice weather
recently as we have spent most days in our small garden. When I first started isolation we had no garden toys, but
luckily our family and friends donated some to keep our son busy. The hardest part has been keeping our toddler
occupied. I have done lots of cleaning!!
I've got a huge garden that needs loads of restoration. I put the infrastructure in last year including a kitchen garden.
I've loads of seeds, two polytunnels plus a small flock of ex battery hens. Plenty to keep me busy.
I've been in the house since 24th Feb, cos I had Covid 19 then, and was ill for 5 weeks. I spend time with my husband;
I talk to friends and family on line; I do 'colouring in, and I watch a lot of TV.
I also spend a lot of time trying to get supermarket deliveries for us and for my 87 year old mum, who is 350 miles
away!
I don’t feel I’ve had to cope‚ I’ve found it easy.
We have a garden and surrounded by farmland so naturally isolated. We spend time in the garden, care for our pets
(on property), try and homeschool my children and maintain housekeeping routines. We have also watched a lot of
children's films which are up lifting
We had been isolating for two weeks prior to this with a vunerable disabled daughter. Working from home and access
to private outside space with delivery of food has made it easy.

T6 : Psycho-social effects of lockdown
I like this way of life. I miss certain things but love the way nature is getting a break.
I wish we would stay like this forever with a limit on our carbon consumption and a carbon currency used. I guess
thinking about these things is helping me cope, but it's not lockdown that's the problem, it's the thought of people
'returning to normal'.
I am not copeing well. I was just emerging from a depressive episode that had lasted six months. Now I'm feeling
much worse and would rather die than live like this. So many of the events that I had booked, which were what was
giving me a reason to look forward to and keep going, have now been cancelled. There's nothing to look forward to
and being stuck in doors with no gym or friends to see is miserable. This life is not worth living.
I am not coping since I have Asperger's syndrome which makes me terribly anxious. I talk to my wife who is coping
better. I feel tremendous resentment at the strategy some want to pursue. Repeated lockdowns until end 2021!?!?! I
repeat REPEATED, PROLONGED LOCKDOWNS ARE BARBARIC AND UNACCEPTABLE.
I have 6 yr old grandson living with me, he is a difficult child, so this makes coping more difficult. I would do better
coping on my own.
Nothing different, its just more peaceful while I read, meditate and learn
I live by myself, in a City 30 miles from my nearest family (sister). I don't see friends very often. Apart from not being
able to go out in my car, nothing has changed that much.
I don't find it particularly difficult; nothing has happened to me/my family yet, and I do not tend to worry ahead. I
think that it is a fascinating time, in a way, and observing the social/sociological/psychological side of it is rather
exciting. I would probably miss going out, but I currently have leg injury and cannot walk anyway; that is quite
annoying. What I worry about is when will I be able to visit/see my family (parents/brother) - they are overseas (I am
Polish). But, as I have no impact on it, I do not think about this too much. (This is, actually, quite a prompting question
- why assume it is automatically 'difficult'? There may be a variety of reactions)
Doing exactly the same things as I did before. Hasn't changed my life much.
no change to my life, just can't go to the pub
I am alone anyway. So in a perverse way, the fact that others now have to live simply and quietly by themselves is a
strange comfort.
Been involved in NHS all my adult life (ex husband a Doctor) In the past, was sad that I had wasted my life caring so
much. Now feel proud to have carried that torch of humanity, and see it blaze in this time of uncertainty. It is all that
really counts in a life lived.
T7 : Playing games/Quality Time Together
Playing guitar
Enjoying family movies together
riding bike / running
Having projects to do in the house & garden (re-upholstered an ottoman, lifted paving slabs, painted fences) catching
up on incomplete tasks or tasks not yet got round to (tidying the cupboards etc).
Playing board games and video games with my daughter. Baking and cooking with my daughter.
