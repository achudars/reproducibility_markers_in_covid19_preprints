Prehospitalization Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and Clinical
Outcomes in COVID-19

Abstract
Background and Aim
Gastric acid has shown to neutralize many viruses. The working receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is
angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which has shown to be omnipresent in the
gastrointestinal tract. There is a theoretical concern that SARS-CoV-2 can escape the
neutralization by gastric acid because of hypochlorhydria caused by the use of proton pump
inhibitors (PPI) and can predispose the patients for severe COVID-19.
Methods
We studied the association between prehospitalization PPI use and clinical outcomes among
hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Results
In our study, 15.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were on PPIs at home. Mortality among
PPI-users was 2.3 times higher than non-users, along with 2.5 times higher risk of mechanical
ventilation. This relationship existed even after adjusting for confounding variables.
Conclusion
These results warrant further investigation in prospective studies to evaluate if PPI-induced
hypochlorhydria is associated with worse outcomes, including mortality because of the
omnipresence of ACE-2 in the gastrointestinal tract.

Keywords: Proton pump inhibitors; PPI; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; gastrointestinal symptoms;

Prehospitalization Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) use and Clinical
Outcomes in COVID-19
Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2]. Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 can also present
with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, dysgeusia, diarrhea, and
abdominal pain [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified
as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 to enter the epithelial cells, and it is highly expressed
throughout the GI system, including the gastric epithelium [6]. It is thought that gastric acid
could neutralize the virus on ingestion, and there is a concern that decreased gastric acid
secretion by proton pump inhibitors (PPI) could potentially increase the risk of GI symptoms
and might increase severity in COVID-19 [7, 8]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that
there is an increased risk of infections and all-cause mortality in patients with prolonged use of
PPIs [9]. However, no study has determined an association between the history of PPI use and
clinical outcomes, particularly mortality in COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the association
between PPI and clinical outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Methods
It is a retrospective cohort study conducted on patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of
COVID-19 in a tertiary care academic medical center in Brooklyn, New York, from March 1st to
April 25th, 2020. Patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years, who were not
hospitalized and managed on an ambulatory basis, pregnant, unavailability of the results of
SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal testing, and missing data on mortality or disposition. Data related
to patientsâ€™ demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidities, history of medications, vitals at
presentation, admission laboratory tests, inpatient medications, and outcomes were collected.
In our study, the primary exposure of interest was the history of PPI use as a home medication.
The home PPI use was determined based on the documentation of any type of PPI use
(including omeprazole, esomeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, etc.) as an active home

medication at the time of admission. The study cohort was divided into two groups based on
PPI use at home: COVID-19 patients on PPI (cases) and COVID-19 patients not on PPI (controls).
The primary outcomes are all-cause mortality and mechanical ventilation. The secondary
outcomes are septic shock and hospital length of stay.
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS software version 26 (SPSS Inc, Armonk, NY)
and STATA 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Two models of multivariable logistic
regression analysis were conducted for evaluating the effect of PPI use on the primary
dichotomous outcome variables, death, and mechanical ventilation separately. In Model 1, we
adjusted for any significant variables associated with PPI (P<0.05) based on the univariate
analysis. In Model 2, we performed the multivariable analysis based on clinically relevant
confounders associated with outcome and PPI use (BMI, Age, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, CAD, DM,
Cancer, COPD, aspirin, statin, smoker, gender, H2 blocker use). All the non-significant predictors
were dropped from the final model and retained the maximum five variables to avoid any overfitting issue in the multivariable model. The effect size of PPI use obtained from logistic
regression analyses was summarized using the odds ratio (OR) along with a 95% confidence
interval (CI). P-values less than or equal to 5% were considered statistically significant results.
We also performed subgroup analyses, according to essential cofactors, to examine the
heterogeneity of PPI effects on mortality outcomes (Forest Plot).
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Protocol 20-12) of Brookdale
University.
Results
A total of 295 hospitalized COVID-19 patients formed our final study population. Of these,
15.6% (46/295) patients had documentation of any PPI use before admission (Figure 1).
Baseline demographics, laboratory, and outcomes data are shown in table 1. We observed
increased mortality in patients with a history of PPI compared to patients without PPI (34.8% vs.
16.2%, P=0.007). The odds of mortality remained significantly higher in the PPI group compared
to control (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.1 â€“ 4.8, P=0.03) even after adjusting for potential factors in
multivariate analysis (Table 2).

Furthermore, the odds of mechanical ventilation were also observed to be higher in cases when
compared to controls after adjusting for potential confounders as well as predictors (OR 2.5,
95% CI 1.1â€“5.4, P =0.02). The PPI use was associated with an increased odds of mortality in
most subgroups of patients, as shown in the Forest Plot (Figure 2). The profound effect of PPI
on mortality was observed in younger patients without cardiac risk factors (diabetes,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, CAD) or Charlsonâ€™s comorbidity index of zero, suggesting that a
history of PPI exacerbate prognosis even in patients without having underlying cardiac
conditions.
Discussion
In our study, we found that 15.6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were on PPIs at home. PPIusers had more than two-fold higher risks of mortality and mechanical ventilation requirement
than non-users, even after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Our subgroup analyses
showed that PPI users had markedly worse prognosis in patients without underlying cardiac
comorbidities.
PPIs predominately exert their effect by reducing gastric acid output via irreversible proton
pump inhibition [10]. This profound hypochlorhydria can diminish the protective effect of
gastric acid, which can theoretically increase the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the stomach and
invading the GI epithelial cells [1, 8, 11]. In the study by Xiao et al., viral host receptor ACE2 and
viral nucleocapsid protein stained positive in the cytoplasm of GI epithelial cells suggesting that
the SARS-CoV-2 virus invades the mucosal cells, multiply and produce virions [1]. In addition,
the reduced acid output due to PPI can change the composition of the gut microbiome, which
could increase enteric infections [9, 12, 13]. Furthermore, digestive symptoms such as altered
taste, nausea, loss of appetite, and diarrhea are common in COVID-19 patients, and few studies
reported worse outcomes with the presence of GI symptoms [2, 5]. In our study, the PPI group
did not have higher GI symptoms compared to controls. It remains to be studied in prospective
studies if individuals with long-term PPI users are more susceptible to manifest GI symptoms.
Although in our study, the PPI-group is associated with increased mortality after adjustment of
potential confounders, these differences should be interpreted with caution as there could be

potential unrecognizable confounders. The biological plausibility of such association needs
further elaboration, especially with changes in acid secretion and viral transmission through the
GI tract. Further studies are urgently needed to evaluate the effect of pH changes in the
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Regardless, these findings are vital and provide a roadmap for future
studies to evaluate the effect of PPI use and outcomes in COVID-19.
Important limitations exist for this study. Our study is a single-center, retrospective, small-sized
study which could introduce bias and limit its generalizability. Given the retrospective nature of
the study, we could only include the information which was available in the medical records.
We were unable to determine the information about the type, dose, duration, frequency, and
compliance for the PPI use since we did not have access to the outpatient medical records.
Lastly, potential unrecognized confounders could have been missed in our study. Despite these
limitations, the main strength of the study is that it addresses a clinically significant issue about
the implication of pre-hospitalization PPI use and COVID-19.
In conclusion, Pre-hospitalization PPI use is prevalent in COVID-19 infected patients and
associated with increased mortality and MV support among hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The results of our study warrant further investigation to evaluate if PPI-induced acid
suppression is associated with worse clinical outcomes primarily because of the omnipresence
of ACE-2 in the GI tract.

Forest Plot indicates that PPI increased the odds of mortality regardless of any patient
subgroups. It also shows that PPI increased the odds of mortality in patients who had CCI (at
least 1 or higher) or received statin. Even patients without having cardiac risk factors (DM, HTN,
HLD, and CAD) or CCI of zero had a higher odds of mortality if they received PPI. PPI did not
increase the odds of mortality only among patients who had asthma, received ACE-ARB, and did
not receive a statin.
