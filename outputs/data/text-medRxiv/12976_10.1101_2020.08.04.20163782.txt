Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore the need for policy makers to receive timely and
ongoing scientific guidance in response to this recently emerged human infectious disease. Fitting
mathematical models of infectious disease transmission to the available epidemiological data provides
a key statistical tool for understanding the many quantities of interest that are not explicit in the
underlying epidemiological data streams. Of these, the basic reproductive ratio, R, has taken on
special significance in terms of the general understanding of whether the epidemic is under control
(R < 1). Unfortunately, none of the epidemiological data streams are designed for modelling, hence
assimilating information from multiple (often changing) sources of data is a major challenge that is
particularly stark in novel disease outbreaks.
Here, focusing on the dynamics of the first-wave (March-June 2020), we present in some detail the
inference scheme employed for calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model to the available public health
data streams, which span hospitalisations, critical care occupancy, mortality and serological testing.
We then perform computational simulations, making use of the acquired parameter posterior distributions, to assess how the accuracy of short-term predictions varied over the timecourse of the outbreak.
To conclude, we compare how refinements to data streams and model structure impact estimates of
epidemiological measures, including the estimated growth rate and daily incidence.

Introduction

1

In late 2019, accounts emerged from Wuhan city in China of a virus of unknown origin that was leading
to a cluster of pneumonia cases [1]. The virus was identified as a novel strain of coronavirus on 7th
January 2020 [2], subsequently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), causing the respiratory syndrome known as COVID-19. The outbreak has since developed into a
global pandemic. As of 3rd August 2020 the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is approaching
18 million, with more than 685,000 deaths occurring worldwide [3]. Faced with these threats, there
is a need for robust predictive models that can help policy makers by quantifying the impact of a
range of potential responses. However, as is often stated, models are only as good as the data that
underpins them; it is therefore important to examine, in some detail, the parameter inference methods
and agreement between model predictions and data.
In the UK, the first cases of COVID-19 were reported on 31st January 2020 in the city of York. Cases
continued to be reported sporadically throughout February and by the end of the month guidance
was issued stating that travellers from the high-risk epidemic hotspots of Hubei province in China,
Iran and South Korea should self-isolate upon arrival in the UK. By mid-March, as the number of
cases began to rise, there was advice against all non-essential travel and, over the coming days, several
social-distancing measures were introduced including the closing of schools, non-essential shops, pubs
and restaurants. This culminated in the introduction of a UK lockdown, announced on the evening of
23rd March, whereby the public were instructed to remain at home with four exceptions: shopping for
essentials; any medical emergency; for one form of exercise per day; and to travel to work if absolutely
necessary. By mid-April, these stringent mitigation strategies began to have an effect, as the number
of confirmed cases and deaths as a result of the disease began to decline. As the number of daily
confirmed cases continued to decline during April, May and into June, measures to ease lockdown
restrictions began, with the re-opening of some non-essential businesses and allowing small groups of
individuals from different households to meet up outdoors, whilst maintaining social distancing. This
was followed by gradually re-opening primary schools in England from 1st June and all non-essential
retail outlets from 15th June. Predictive models for the UK are therefore faced with a changing set of
behaviours against which historic data must be judged, and an uncertain future of potential additional
relaxations.
Throughout, a significant factor in the decision-making process was the value of the effective reproduction number, R of the epidemic; this quantity was estimated by several modelling groups that provided
advice through the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling Group (SPI-M) [4]. The Warwick COVID19 model presented here provided one source of R estimates through SPI-M. When R is estimated to
be significantly below one, such that the epidemic is exponentially declining, then there is scope for
some relaxation of intervention measures. However, as Rt approaches one, further relaxation of control
may lead to cases starting to rise again. It is therefore crucial that models continue to be fitted to the
latest epidemiological data in order for them to provide the most robust information regarding the
impact of any relaxation policy and the effect upon the value of Rt . It is important to note, however,
that there will necessarily be a delay between any change in behaviour, the epidemiological impact
and the ability of an statistical method to detect this change.
The initial understanding of key epidemiological characteristics for a newly emergent infectious disease
is, by its very nature of being novel, extremely limited and often biased towards early severe cases.
Developing models of infectious disease dynamics enables us to challenge and improve our mechanistic
understanding of the underlying epidemiological processes based on a variety of data sources. One way
such insights can be garnered is through model fitting / parameter inference, the process of estimating
the parameters of the mathematical model from data. The task of fitting a model to data is often
challenging, partly due to the necessary complexity of the model in use, but also because of data

limitations and the need to assimilate information from multiple sources of data [5].
Throughout this work, the process of model fitting is performed under a Bayesian paradigm, where
model parameters are assumed to be random variables and have joint probability distributions [6].
These probability distributions quantify uncertainty in the model parameters, which can be translated
into uncertainty in model predictions. We take a likelihood-based approach, in which we define the
likelihood (the probability of observing the data given a particular model and parameter set) and
use the likelihood to find the probability distribution of our model parameters. In particular, we use
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes to find the posterior probability distribution of our
parameter set given the data and our prior beliefs. MCMC methods construct a Markov chain which
converges to the desired posterior parameter distribution at steady state [7]. Simulating this Markov
chain thus allows us to draw sets of parameters from the joint posterior distribution.
As stated above, the parameter uncertainty may then be propagated if using the model to make projections. This affords models with mechanistic aspects, through computational simulation, the capability
of providing an estimated range of predicted possibilities given the evidence presently available. Thus,
models can demonstrate important principles about outbreaks [8], with examples during the present
pandemic including analyses of the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curbing the outbreak
of COVID-19 in the UK [9].
In this paper, we present the inference scheme, and its subsequent refinements, employed for calibrating
the Warwick COVID-19 model [10] to the available public health data streams and estimating key
epidemiological quantities such as R. In particular it is worth stressing that throughout we present
our approach as it evolved during the outbreak, rather than the optimal methods and assumptions
that would be made with hindsight.
We begin by describing our mechanistic transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 in section 2, detailing in
section 3 how the effects of social distancing are incorporated within the model framework. In order to
fit the model to data streams pertaining to critical care, such as hospital admissions and bed occupancy,
section 4 expresses how epidemiological outcomes were mapped onto these quantities. In section 5, we
outline how these components are incorporated into the likelihood function and the adopted MCMC
scheme. The estimated parameters are then used to measure epidemiological measures of interest,
such as the growth rate (r), with the approach detailed in section 6.
The closing sections draw attention to how model frameworks may evolve during the course of a disease
outbreak as more data streams become available and we collectively gain a better understanding
of the epidemiology (section 7). We explore how key epidemiological quantities, in particular the
reproduction number R and the growth rate r, depend on the data sources used to underpin the
dynamics (section 8). To finish, we outline the latest fits and model generated estimates using data
up to mid-June (section 9).

Model description

83

We present here the system of equations that account for the transmission dynamics, including symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, household saturation of transmission and household quarantining. The population is stratified into multiple compartments: individuals may be susceptible (S),
exposed (E), with detectable infection (symptomatic D), or undetectable infection (asymptomatic,
U ). Undetectable infections are assumed to transmit infection at a reduced rate given by τ . We
let superscripts denote the first infection in a household (F ), a subsequent infection from a detectable/symptomatic household member (SD) and a subsequent infection from an asymptomatic
household member (SU ). A fraction (H) of the first detected case in a household is quarantined
(QF ), as are all their subsequent household infections (QS) - we ignore the impact of household quarantining on the susceptible population as the number in quarantine is assumed small compared with
the rest of the population. The recovered class is not explicitly modelled, although it may become
important once we have a better understanding of the duration of immunity. Natural demography
and disease-induced mortality are ignored in the formulation of the epidemiological dynamics.

where β H represents household transmission and β N = β S + β W + β O represents all other transmission
locations, comprising school-based transmission (β S ), work-place transmission (β W ) and transmission
in all other locations (β O ). These matrices are taken from Prem et al [11], although other sources such
as POLYMOD [12] could be used. σa corresponds to the age-dependent susceptibility of individuals
to infection, da the age-dependent probability of displaying symptoms (and hence being detected),
and τ represents reduced transmission of infection by undetectable individuals compared to detectable
infections.

Amendments to within-household transmission
We wanted our model to be able to capture both individual level quarantining and isolation of households with identified cases. In an standard ODE framework this level of household structure is only
achievable at large computational expense [13, 14], so instead we make a number of approximation to
achieve a comparable effect.
We make the simplification that all within household transmission originates from the first infected
individual within the household (denoted with a superscript F or QF is they quarantine). This allows
us to assume that secondary infections within a household in isolation (denoted with a superscript
QS or Q) play no further role in the transmission dynamics. This means that high levels of household
isolation can drive the epidemic extinct, as only the first individual infected in each household can
generate infections outside the household. This methodology also helps to capture to some degree
household depletion of susceptibles (or saturation of infection), as secondary infections in the household
are not able to generate additional household infections. Adopting this formulation naturally leads
to a reduction in total onward transmission compared with a model where such household effects is
ignored - this is because we have truncated within household transmission. We find that a simple
multiplicative scaling to the household transmission (β H → zβ H , z ≈ 1.3) generates a close match
between the new model and one in which saturation effects are ignored, and we therefore include this
scaling within the full model.

As with any model of this complexity, there are multiple parameters that determine the dynamics.
Some of these are global parameters and apply for all geographical regions, with others used to capture
the regional dynamics. Some of these parameters are fitted to the early outbreak and other data
(table 1), however the majority are inferred by the MCMC process (table 2).

Relationship between age-dependent susceptibility and detectability
We interlink age-dependent susceptibility, σa , and detectability, da , by a quantity Qa . Qa can be
viewed as the scaling between force of infection and symptomatic infection. Taking a next-generation
approach, the early dynamics would be specified by:
N
R0 Da = da σa βba
(Da + τ Ua ) /γ

132

133
134
135

N
R0 Ua = (1 − da )σa βba
(Da + τ Ua ) /γ

where Da measures those with detectable infections, which mirrors the early recorded age distribution
(1−α)
of symptomatic cases. Explicitly, we let da = κ1 Qa
and σa = k1 Qαa . As a consequence, Qa = κkda σa ;
where the parameters κ and k are determined such that the oldest age groups have a 90% probability
of being symptomatic (d>90 = 0.90) and such that the basic reproductive ratio from these calculations
gives R0 = 2.7.

Throughout much of our work with this model, the values of α and τ are key in determining behaviour
- in particular the role of school children in transmission [15]. We argue that a low τ and a low α
are the only combination that are consistent with the growing body of data suggesting that levels
of seroprevalence show only moderate variation across age-ranges [16], yet children do not appear to
play a major role in transmission [17, 18]. To some extent, the separation into symptomatic (D) and
asymptomatic (U ) within the model is somewhat artificial as there are a wide spectrum of symptom
severity that can be experienced.

Regional Heterogeneity in the Dynamics

Firstly, the initial level of infection in the region is re-scaled from the early age-distribution of cases,
with the regional scaling factor set by the MCMC process. Secondly, we allow the age-dependent
susceptibility to be scaled between regions (scaling factor I R ) to account for different levels of social
mixing and hence differences in the early R0 value. Finally, the relative strength of the lockdown
(which may be time-varying) is again regional and is determined by the MCMC process.

Age-structured contact matrices for the United Kingdom were obtained from Prem et al. [11] and

used to provide information on household transmission (βab

transmission (βab ) and transmission in all other locations (βab ). We assumed that the suite of socialdistancing and lockdown measures acted in concert to reduce the work, school and other matrices
while increasing the strength of household contacts.
We capture the impact of social-distancing by defining new transmission matrices (Ba,b ) that represent
the potential transmission in the presence of extreme lockdown. In particular, we assume that:

Throughout the current epidemic, there has been noticeable heterogeneity between the different regions
of England and between the devolved nations. In particular, London is observed to have a large
proportion of early cases and a relatively steeper decline in the subsequent lock-down than the other
regions and the devolved nations. In our model this heterogeneity is captured through three regional
parameters which act on the heterogeneous population pyramid of each region.

As such, home and school interactions are scaled between their pre-lockdown values (β) and postlockdown limits (B) by the scaling parameter φ. Work interactions that are not in public-facing
‘industries’ (a proportion 1 - θ) were also assumed to scale in this manner; while those that interact
with the general populations (such as shop-workers) were assumed to scale as both a function of their
reduction and the reduction of others. We have assumed θ = 0.3 throughout. Similarly, the reduction
in transmission in other settings (generally shopping and leisure) has been assumed to scale with the
reduction in activity of both members of any interaction, giving rise to a squared term.

Public Health Measurable Quantities

The main model equations focus on the epidemiological dynamics, allowing us to compute the number
of symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious individuals over time. However, these quantities are not
measured - and even the number of confirmed cases (the closest measure to symptomatic infections) is
highly biased by the testing protocols at any given point in time. It is therefore necessary to convert
infection estimates into quantities of interest that can be compared to data. We considered six such
quantities which we calculated from the number of newly detectable symptomatic infections on a given
day nDd .
1. Hospital Admissions: We assume that a fraction PaD→H of detectable cases will be admitted
into hospital after a delayP
q from the onset of symptoms. The delay, q, is drawn from a distribution DqD→H (note that q DqD→H = 1.) Hospital admissions on day d of age a are therefore
given by

hospital. We therefore define two weightings, which determine if someone admitted to hospital
still occupies a hospital bed q days later (TqH ) and if someone admitted to ICU occupies a
hospital bed on a normal ward q days later (TqI→H ). Hospital beds occupied on day d of age a
are therefore given by

X

6. Proportion testing seropositive: Seropositivity is a function of time since the onset of symptoms; we therefore define an increasing sigmoidal function which determines the probability that
someone who first displayed symptoms q days ago would generate a positive serology test from
a blood sample. The shape of this sigmoidal function is matched to data from PHE, while
the asymptote (the long-term sensitivity of the test, ST ) is a free parameter determined by the
MCMC. We match our age-dependent prediction against antibody seroprevalence from weekly
blood donor samples from different regions of England (approximately 1000 samples per region) [19].
These nine distributions are all parameterised from individual patient data as recorded by the COVID19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System (CHESS) [20], the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) database sourced from the COVID-19 Clinical Information Network
(CO-CIN) [21, 22], and the PHE sero-surveillance of blood donors [19]. CHESS data is used to define the probabilities of different outcomes (PaD→H , PaD→I , PaH→Death ) due to its greater number of
records, while CCP-UK is used to generate the distribution of times (DqD→H , DqD→I , DqH→Death ,TqH ,
TqI , TqD→I ) due to its greater detail (Figure S1).
However, these distributions all represent a national average and do not therefore reflect regional
differences. We therefore define regional scalings of the three key probabilities (PaD→H , PaD→I and
PaH→Death ) and two additional parameters that can stretch (or contract) the distribution of times spent
in hospital and ICU. These five regional parameters are necessary to get good agreement between key
observations in all regions and may reflect both differences in risk groups (in addition to age) between
regions or differences in how the data are recorded between devolved nations. We stress that these
parameters do not (of themselves) influence the epidemiological dynamics, but do strongly influence
how we fit to the evolving dynamics.

Likelihood Function and the MCMC process

Multiple components form the likelihood function; most of which are based on a Poisson-likelihood.
For brevity we define LP (n|x) = (n ln(x) − x) / log(n!) as the log of the probability of observing i
given a Poisson distribution with mean x. Similarly LB (n|N, p) is the log of the binomial probability

This log-likelihood is the key component of the MCMC scheme. In the MCMC process, we apply
multiple updates of the parameters using normal or log-normal proposal distributions about the current
values. Some parameters (the scaling of age-structure α, the relative transmission rate τ , the latent
period 1/ε and the test sensitivity ST ) are global and apply to all regions; new values of these are
proposed and the log-likelihood calculated over all 10 regions. Other parameters are regional (such
as the relative strength of lockdown restrictions φR ) and can be updated for each region in turn, the
ODEs simulated and stored. Finally, another set of regional parameters govern how the ODE output
is translated into public health measurable quantities (section 4). These can be rapidly applied to the
solution to the ODEs and the likelihood calculated. Given the speed of this last set, multiple proposals
are tested for each ODE replicate.
New data are available on a daily time-scale, and therefore inference needs to be repeated on a similar
time-scale. We can take advantage of this sequential refitting, by using the posteriors of one inference
process as the initial conditions for the next, thus reducing the need for a long burn-in period.

Measuring the Growth Rate, r

The growth rate, r, is defined as the rate of exponential growth (r > 0) or decay (r < 0); and can be
visualised as the gradient when plotting observables on a logarithmic scale. Figure 1 shows a simple
example, whereby linear trends are fitted to the number of daily hospital admissions (per 100,000
people) in London. In this figure, three trend lines are plotted: one before lock-down; one during
intense lock-down; and one after partial relaxation on 11th May. This plot clearly highlights the very
different speeds between the initial rise and the long-term decline.
While such statistically simple approaches are intuitively appealing, there are three main drawbacks.
Firstly, they are not easily able to cope with the distributed delay between a change in policy (such as
the introduction of the lockdown) and the impact of observable quantities (with the delay to deaths
being multiple weeks). Secondly, they cannot readily utilise multiple data streams. Finally, they can
only be used to extrapolate into the future - extending the period of exponential behaviour - they
cannot predict the impact of further changes to policy. Our approach is to instead fit the ODE model
to multiple data streams, and then use the daily incidence to calculate the growth rate. Since we use
a deterministic set of ODEs, the instantaneous growth rate r can be calculated on a daily basis.

Fig. 1: Daily hospital admissions per 100,000 individuals in London. Points show the number of
daily admissions to hospital (both in-patients testing positive and patients entering hospital following a positive
test); results are plotted on a log scale. Three simple fits to the data are shown for pre-lockdown (red), strictlockdown (blue) and relaxed-lockdown phases (green). Lines are linear fits to the logged data together with
95% confidence intervals, returning average growth rates of 0.21 (doubling every 3.4 days), −0.06 (halving every
11.5 days) and −0.02 (halving every 34 days).

There has been a strong emphasis (especially in the UK) on the value of the reproductive number (R)
which measures the expected number of secondary cases from an infectious individual in an evolving
outbreak. R brings together both the observed epidemic dynamics and the time-frame of the infection,
and is thus subject to uncertainties in the latent and infectious periods as well as in their distribution
- although the growth rate and the reproductive number have to agree at the point r = 0 and R = 1.
We have two separate methods for calculating R which have been found to be in very close numerical
agreement. The first is to calculate R from the next generation matrix βba /γ using the current
distribution of infection across age-classes and states. The second (and numerically simpler method)
is to use the relationship between R and r for an SEIR-type model with multiple latent classes, which

An Evolving Model Framework

Unsurprisingly, the model framework has evolved during the epidemic as more data streams have
become available and as we have gained a better understanding of the epidemiology. Early models
were largely based on the data from Wuhan, and made relatively crude assumptions about the times
from symptoms to hospitalisation and death. Later models incorporated more regional variation, while
the PHE serology data in early May had a profound impact on model parameters.
Figure 2 shows how our short-term predictions (each of three-weeks duration) have changed over time,
focusing on hospital admissions in London. It is clear that the early predictions were pessimistic about
the reduction that would be generated by lockdown, although in part the higher values from early
predictions is due to having identical parameters across all regions in the earliest models. In general

amounts of data. The intervals represent our confidence in the fitted ODE model, and do not account for
either stochastic dynamics nor the observational distribution about the deterministic predictions - which would
generate far wider intervals.

later predictions, especially after the peak, are in far better agreement although the early inclusion of
a step-change in the strength of the lockdown restrictions from 13th May (orange) led to substantial
over-estimation of future hospital admissions. Across all regions we found some anomalous fits, which
are due to changes in the way data were reported (figures S3 and S4).

The comparison of models and data over time can be made more formal by considering the mean

time varying quantities: (i) the mean value of the public health observable (in this case hospital
deaths) in each region; (ii) the mean error between this data and the posterior set of ODE model
predictions predicting forwards for three weeks; (iii) the mean error between the data and a simple
moving average across the three time points before and after the data point. The top left hand graph

average, giving support to our assumption (in the likelihood function) that the data are reasonably
approximated as Poisson distributed such that the variance and mean are equal. The other two graphs
show how the error in the prediction has dropped over time from very high values for simulations in
early April (when the impact of the lockdown was uncertain) to values in late May and June that are
comparable with the error from the moving average.

Choice of Parameters to Inform the Likelihood

The likelihood expression given above is an idealised measure, and depends on all the observed data
streams being available and unbiased. Unfortunately, ICU admission data have not been available to
date, and there are subtle differences in data streams between the devolved nations. An important
question is therefore how key epidemiological quantities (and in particular the reproduction number
R and the growth rate r) depend on the data sources used to underpin the dynamics.

Fig. 4: Impact of a change in underlying restrictions on the growth rate of modelled data streams.
A change in the underlying restrictions occurs at time zero, taking the asymptotic growth rate r from ≈ −0.026
to ≈ +0.01. This change is reflected in an increase in growth rate of five key epidemiological quantities, which
reach the true theoretical growth rate at different times.

In a high dimensional systems with different temporal lags (see Figure S1), there are inevitably different
time-scales from when a change in policy or adherence occurs and when its impact is observed in key
quantities. We briefly assess this problem in Figure 4, by introducing a change in the strength of
lock-down restrictions (φ) and recording the subsequent rates of change of five key model parameters
(infections, symptomatic cases, hospitalisations, admission to ICU and Deaths). Unsurprisingly, the
impact of this change in restrictions takes the longest time to resolve in the mortality, taking around
seven weeks to realise the true growth rate. Even measures which should be more immediate, such
as the growth of symptomatic cases, take some time to settle to the theoretical growth rate given the
high dimensionality of the age-structured model. This all strongly suggests that at best our estimates
of r and hence R will not be able to rapidly detect changes to the underlying behaviour.
Figure 5 (left panel) shows the impact of using different observables for London (other regions are
shown in Figure S5). Five different choices are shown: matching to recorded deaths only (using the
date of death); matching to hospital admissions (both in-patients testing positive and admissions of
individuals who have already tested positive); matching to bed occupancy, both hospital wards and
ICU; matching to a combination of deaths and admissions; and finally matching to all data. In general
we find that just using reported deaths produces the greatest spread of growth rates (r), presumably
because deaths represent a small fraction of the total outbreak, and therefore naturally introduce

more uncertainty. Using hospital admissions (with or without deaths) generates similar predictions
and similar levels of uncertainty in predictions.

Fig. 5: Impact of data streams and model structure on estimated growth rate. Here the growth rates
are estimated using the predicted rate of change of new cases for London on 10th June 2020, with parameters
inferred using data until 9th June. (a) The impact of restricting the inference to different data streams (deaths
only, hospital admissions, hospital bed occupancy, deaths and admissions or all data); serology data was included
in all inference. (b) The impact of having different numbers of lockdown phases (while using all the data); the
default is three (as in Figure 1).

As mentioned in section 7, the number of phases used to describe the reduction in transmission due to
lockdown has changed as the situation, model and data evolved. The model began with just two phases;
before and after lockdown. However, in late May, following the policy changes on 13th May, we explored
having three phases. Having three phases is equivalent to assuming the same level of adherence to
the lockdown and social-distancing measures throughout the epidemic, with changes in transmission
occurring only due to the changing policy on 23rd March and 13th May. However, different number
of phases can be explored (figure 5, right panel). Moving to four phases (with two equally spaced
within the more relaxed lockdown) increases the variation, but does not have a substantial impact on
the mean. Allowing eight phases (spaced every two weeks throughout lockdown) dramatically changes
our estimation of the growth rate as the parameter inference responds more quickly to minor changes
in observable quantities.
Lastly, it was noted in late May that one of the quantities used throughout the outbreak (number of
daily hospital admissions) could be biasing the model fitting. Hospital admissions for COVID-19 are
comprised of two measures:
(i) In-patients that test positive; this includes both individuals entering hospital with COVID-19
symptoms who subsequently test positive, and hospital acquired infections. Given that both of
these elements feature in the hospital death data, it is difficult to separate them.
(ii) Patients arriving at hospital who have previously tested positive. In the early days of the
outbreak, these were individuals who had been swabbed just prior to admission; however in the
latter stages there are many patients being admitted for non-COVID related problems that have
previously tested positive.
It seems prudent to remove this second element from our fitting procedure, although we note that
for the devolved nations this separation into in-patients and new admissions is less clear. Removing
this component of admissions also means that we cannot use the number of occupied beds as part
of the likelihood, as these cannot be separated by the nature of admission. In figure 6 we therefore

compare the default fitting (used throughout this paper) with an updated method that uses in-patient
admissions (together with deaths, ICU occupancy and serology when available). We observe that
restricting the definition of hospital admission leads to a slight reduction in the growth rate r but a
more pronounced reduction in the incidence.

Current Fits and Results

354

Using a fit to the data performed on 14th June, which matched to in-patient data, ICU occupancy,
date of death records and serological results, we analysed growth rate predictions and how growth
rate predictions inferred at earlier times compare to current estimates. We focus on London and the
North East and Yorkshire region, with other regions given in the Supplementary Material.
The time profile of predicted growth rate illustrates how the imposition of lockdown measures on
23rd March led to r decreasing below 0. The predicted growth rate is not a step function as changes
to policy precipitate changes to the age-distribution of cases which has second-order effects on r.
The second change in φ (the relative strength of lockdown restrictions) on 13th May, leads to an
increase in r in all regions, although London shows one of the more pronounced increases. Despite
this increase in mid-May, models estimates suggest r remained below 0 across all regions as of 14th
June (figure 7).
Early changes in advice prior to the introduction of lockdown measures were also included in the model,
such as social distancing, encouragement to work from home (from 16th March) and the closure of
all restaurants, pubs, cafes and schools on 20th March. For all regions, we observe minor declines in
the estimated growth rate following introduction of these measures, though the estimated growth rate
remained above 0 (figure 7). As the model has evolved and the data streams become more complete,
we have generally converged on the estimated growth rates from current inference. It is clear that it
takes around 20 days from the time changes are enacted for them to be robustly incorporated into

model parameters (see dots and 95% credible intervals in figure 7).
Using parameters drawn from the posterior distributions, the model produces predictive posterior
distributions for multiple health outcome quantities that have a strong quantitative correspondence
to the regional observations (figure 8). We recognise there was a looser resemblance to data on
seropositivity, though salient features of the temporal profile are captured. In addition, short-term
forecasts for each measure of interest have been made by continuing the simulation beyond the date
of the final available data point, assuming that behaviour remains as of the final period (starting 13th
May).

Discussion

381

In this study, we have provided an overview of the evolving MCMC inference scheme employed for
calibrating the Warwick COVID-19 model [10] to the available health care, mortality and serological
data streams. We have focused on the period May-June 2020, which corresponds to the first wave of the
outbreak; a brief account of further refinements is given below. The work we describe was performed
under extreme time pressures, working from limited initial knowledge and with data sources of varying
quality. There are therefore assumptions in the model that with time and hindsight we have refined and
compared to other more recently available data sources; similarly, the focus on hot-spots of infection
during the summer and the rise in cases into autumn has shaped much of our methodology. This
article relates the model formulation that was used to understand the dynamics, predict cases and
advise policy during the first wave.
A comparison of model short-term predictions and data over time (i.e. as the outbreak has progressed)
demonstrated an observable decline in the error - suggesting that our model and inference methods
have improved. We have considered in some detail the choice of data sets used to infer model parameters and the impact of this choice on the key emergent properties of the growth rate r and the
reproductive number R. We highlight that many of the decisions about which data sets to utilise
are value judgements based on an epidemiological understanding of the relationships between disease
dynamics and observed outcomes. None of the data sets available to epidemiological modellers are
perfect, all have biases and delays; here we believe that by using multiple data sources in a Bayesian
framework we arrive at a model that achieves a natural compromise. In particular, we have highlighted how single measures such as the number of daily deaths generate considerable uncertainty in
the predicted growth rate (Figure 5) and may be slower to identify changes in behaviour (Figure 4).
However, some questions related to the data are more fundamental; the ambiguity of what constitutes
a COVID hospitalisation (Figure 6) is shown to cause a slight difference in the estimated growth rate
r but a more marked discrepancy in incidence.
It is important that uncertainty in the parameters governing the transmission dynamics, and its
influence on predicted outcomes, be robustly conveyed. Without it, decision makers will be missing
meaningful information and may assume a false sense of precision. MCMC methodologies were a
suitable choice for inferring parameters in our model framework, since we were able to evaluate the
likelihood function quickly enough to make the approach feasible. Nevertheless, for some model
formulations and data, it may not be possible to write down or evaluate the likelihood function. In
these circumstances, an alternative approach to parameter inference is via simulation-based, likelihoodfree methods, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation [23–25].
As we gain collective understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 disease it causes,
the structure of infectious disease transmission models, the inference procedure and the use of data
streams to underpin these models must continuously evolve. The evolution of the model to date is
documented here (Figures 2 and 7), we feel it is important to show this evolving process rather than
simply present the final finished product. A vast body of work exists describing mathematical models
for different infectious outbreaks and the associated parameter inference from epidemiological data.
In most cases, however, these models are fitted retrospectively, using the entire data that have been
collected during an outbreak. Fitting models with such hindsight is often far more accurate than
predictions made in real-time. In the case when models are deployed during active epidemics, there
are also additional challenges associated with the rapid flow of detailed and accurate data. Even if
robust models and methods were available from the start of an outbreak, there are still significant
delays in obtaining, processing and inferring parameters from new information [5]. This is particularly
crucial as new interventions are introduced or significant policy changes occur, such as the relaxation
of multiple non-pharmaceutical interventions during May, June and July of 2020 or the introduction of

the nationwide ”test and trace” protocol [26]. Predicting the impact of such changes will inevitability
be delayed by the lag between deployment and the effects on observable quantities (Figure 4) as well
as the potential need to reformulate model structure or incorporate new data streams.
Multiple refinements to the model structure and approaches have been realised since June and more
are still possible. Immunological assessments have found evidence of some infected individuals becoming seronegative within eight weeks of hospital discharge [27], this waning seropositivity mechanism
has been included in the model, providing a better match to later serology data where a decline in
seropositivity has been observed - especially in London [19]. (It is worth stressing that here we are
describing a waning of the ability to detect that someone has been infected, rather than a direct
waning of the immune respond and therefore reversion to susceptibility.) The knowledge that infection may be partially driven by nosocomial transmission [28, 29], while significant mortality is due to
infection in care homes [30, 31], suggests that additional compartments capturing these components
could greatly improve model realism if the necessary data were available throughout the course of
the epidemic. Additionally, as we approach much lower levels of infection in the community, it may
be prudent to adopt a stochastic model formulation at a finer spatial resolution to capture localised
outbreak clusters, although the potential heterogeneity in local parameters may preclude accurate
prediction at this scale. Since June, an additional source of data has become available: the number
of positive and negative samples through Pillar 1 and 2 swabbing (generally reflecting testing in the
health-care and community settings). This rich data source is now incorporated within the likelihood,
relating modelled levels of infection to the proportion of positive samples. More consideration has
also been given to detecting changes in the strength of social distancing (φ). In this model original
model φ was inferred in two main phases: the main lockdown (from 23rd March to 13th May) and the
more relaxed restrictions (from 13th May). In practice, there will be continuous changes to this quantity as the population’s behaviour varies, given the importance to public health planning of rapidly
detecting such changes the values of φ are now estimated on a weekly timescale. Finally, we have
assumed that many of the observable epidemiological quantities (such as hospitalisation and death)
are related in a fixed way to the age-distribution of infection in the population. In reality, the medical
treatment of COVID-19 cases in the UK has changed dramatically since the first few cases in early
March, such that the risk of mortality, the need for hospitalisation and the duration of hospital stay
have all changed. Incorporating such changes is essential if the model is to predict both the first and
subsequent waves.
In summary, if epidemiological models are to be used as part of the scientific discussion of controlling
a disease outbreak it is vital that these models capture current biological understanding and are
continually matched to all available data in real time. Our work on COVID-19 presented here highlights
some of the challenges with predicting a novel outbreak in a rapidly changing environment. Probably
the greatest weakness is the time that it inevitably takes to respond – both in terms of developing
the appropriate model and inference structure, and the mechanisms to process any data sources, but
also in terms of delay between real-world changes and their detection within any inference scheme.
Both of these can be shortened by well-informed preparations; having the necessary suite of models
supported by the latest most efficient inference techniques could be hugely beneficial when rapid and
robust predictive results are required.

Fig. S7: Impact of including different types of hospital admission in parameter inference on the
estimated regional growth rates (on 10th June 2020). For each region, growth rates were estimated from
the ODE epidemic for 10th June 2020. In each panel, blue dots (on the left-hand side) give r estimates when
using all hospital admissions in the parameter inference (together with deaths, ICU occupancy and serology when
available); red dots (on the right-hand side) represent r estimates using an alternative inference method that
restricted to fitting to in-patient hospital admission data (together with deaths, ICU occupancy and serology
when available). Parameters were inferred using data until 9th June, while the r value comes from the change
in predicted rate of change of new cases. We observe that restricting the definition of hospital admission leads
to a slight reduction in the growth rate r but a more pronounced reduction in the incidence. (This separation
is not possible for the devolved nations, but the associated distributions are shown for completeness.)

Fig. S9: Evolution of growth rate predictions and model estimates in each of the ten regions.
For each region, we show how predictions of r have evolved over time (dots and 95% credible intervals). These
predictions are from the date the MCMC inference is performed. The solid blue line (together with 50% and
95% credible intervals) shows our estimate of r through time using the later fits to the data (performed on 14th
June using in-patient data only). Vertical dashed lines show the two dates of main changes in policy, reflected
in different regional φ values.
