SUMMARY
BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may exacerbate
COVID-19 and worsen associated outcomes by upregulating the enzyme that SARS-CoV-2
binds to enter cells. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined the association
between NSAID use and the risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among hospitalised patients.
METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using South Korea’s nationwide
healthcare database, which contains data of all subjects who received a test for COVID-19
(n=69,793) as of April 8, 2020. We identified a cohort of adults hospitalised with COVID-19,
where cohort entry was the date of hospitalisation. NSAIDs users were those prescribed
NSAIDs in the 7 days before and including the date of cohort entry and non-users were those
not prescribed NSAIDs during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite of inhospital death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; our
secondary outcome was cardiovascular or renal complications. We conducted logistic
regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using
inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize potential confounding.
FINDINGS: Of 1,824 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 (mean age 49·0 years, standard
deviation 19·0 years; female 59%), 354 were NSAIDs users and 1,470 were non-users.
Compared with non-use, NSAIDs use was associated with increased risks of the primary
composite outcome (OR 1·65, 95% CI 1·21-2·24) and of cardiovascular or renal
complications (OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·25-2·80). Our main findings remained consistent when we
extended the exposure ascertainment window to include the first three days of hospitalisation
(OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·06-3·29).
INTERPRETATION: Use of NSAIDs, compared with non-use, is associated with worse
outcomes among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. While awaiting the results of confirmatory

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic.1,2 Concerns exist that the use
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may exacerbate COVID-19 by
upregulating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressions,3,4 the enzyme which
SARS-CoV-2 binds to enter cells. In addition, NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX),5
which could be involved in the pathogenesis of viral infections to result in tissue damage.6,7
These concerns are were based on unconfirmed anecdotal reports of four young
COVID-19 patients who developed serious infectious complications following NSAIDs use.8
The Health Minister of France subsequently recommended that paracetamol (acetaminophen)
be used as first-line antipyretic agents over NSAIDs.
In contrast, the US Food and Drug Admnistration,9 European Medicine Agency,10
and Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Admnistraiton11 stated that there is insufficient evidence to
draw conclusions regarding this safety concern and thus, current clinical practice should not
be changed until further evidence becomes available. This position is supported by a recent
systematic review of randomised trials and observational studies of respiratory viral
infections, which concluded that there is currently no evidence to support that NSAIDs are
harmful with respect to COVID-19.12 Despite the widespread use of NSAIDs, to our
knowledge, there is currently no published observational study that specifically assessed the
association between NSAIDs use and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients.
This cohort study therefore aimed to examine the association between NSAIDs use,
compared to non-use, and worsened clinical outcomes among adults hospitalised with
COVID-19 using South Korea’s nationwide healthcare database containing all COVID-19
patients.

METHODS
Data source
We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database of
South Korea, provided as part of the #OpenData4Covid19 project, a global research
collaboration on COVID-19 jointly conducted by Ministry of Health and Welfare of Korea
and HIRA.13 Briefly, the South Korean government released the world's first de-identified
COVID-19 nationwide patient data on March 27, 2020. Owing to South Korea’s National
Health Insurance system, which is the universal single-payer healthcare provider covering the
entire Korean population of 50 million, and its fee-for-service reimbursement system, the
database includes information from both inpatient and outpatient settings.
The HIRA COVID-19 database contains data of all subjects who received a test for
COVID-19 as of April 8, 2020, linked to their administrative healthcare data from the
previous 3 years (January 1, 2017 to April 8, 2020). The HIRA COVID-19 database includes
anonymized patient identifiers, sociodemographic characteristics, healthcare utilization
history, diagnoses (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; ICD-10), and drug
prescription information (national drug chemical code, prescription date, day’s supply, dosage,
route of administration). The national drug chemical codes used in South Korea are based on
the drug’s active chemical ingredient, and are mapped to the Anatomical Therapeutic
Chemical (ATC) classification codes (Supplementary Material 1).14
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sungkyunkwan
University (SKKU 2020-03-012), which waived the requirement of obtaining informed
consent.

1, 2020 to April 8, 2020, 5,707 tested positive for COVID-19 (Figure 1). The presence of
COVID-19 was defined by positive findings on Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
approved diagnostic tests that used the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
method targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, N, and E genes.15 Confirmed
COVID-19 cases were patients with a positive diagnostic test result and a recorded diagnosis
of COVID-19, defined using domestic codes (Supplementary Material 2).
This population-based cohort study included 1,824 adults (aged ≥19 years)
hospitalised with COVID-19 between January 20, 2020 (e.g., when the first patient was
admitted) and April 8, 2020 in South Korea (Figure 1). In South Korea, patients diagnosed
with COVID-19 are required to be admitted to hospital if they are symptomatic, and they
remain hospitalised until fully recovered from COVID-19.16 With the HIRA COVID-19
database covering all Koreans, our study enrolled all inpatients who were hospitalised for
COVID-19, and cohort entry was defined by the date of admission for incident COVID-19
hospitalisation.

Exposure to NSAIDs
We defined exposure using inpatient and outpatient prescription records of NSAIDs
from the HIRA database, including both oral and intravenous formulations (aceclofenac,
diclofenac, etodolac, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, dexibuprofen, ibuprofen, ibuproxam,
ketoprofen, dexketoprofen,

ketorolac,

meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, celecoxib,

polmacoxib, etoricoxib) (Supplementary Material 2). We ascertained exposure to NSAIDs
according to an intention-to-treat approach, in which exposure was defined in the index
period of 7 days before and including the date of cohort entry among hospitalized COVID-19
patients. Patients prescribed NSAIDs during this period were classified as NSAIDs users
whereas those not prescribed NSAIDs during this period were classified as non-users. To

minimize any time-related biases such as immortal time,17 follow-up was initiated from the
date of cohort entry for both NSAIDs users and non-users and was ended on the earliest of
date of outcome occurrence or end of the study period (April 8, 2020).

Outcomes
Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital death, intensive care
unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis. Our secondary outcome was a
composite endpoint of cardiovascular or renal complications (myocardial infarction, stroke,
heart failure, acute renal failure). We defined outcomes using in-hospital ICD-10 diagnostic
codes and procedures using the national procedure coding system (Supplementary Material 2).

Potential confounders
We assessed sociodemographic and clinical factors considered to be associated with
NSAIDs use and risk of the outcomes of interest. For sociodemographic factors, we assessed
age, sex, and health insurance type (national health insurance, medical aid) at cohort entry;
age was grouped into 10-year bands. Clinical variables included comorbidities and use of comedications assessed in the year before cohort entry using inpatient and outpatient data. The
following comorbidities were defined using ICD-10 diagnostic codes: hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, atherosclerosis, chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis, gastrointestinal conditions. We used the expanded benefit coverage codes in
addition to diagnosis codes to define malignancy to minimize false positives. Use of comedications were defined using ATC codes and included the following medications:
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor II blockers (ARBs), βblockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and nitrates (Supplementary Material 2).

Statistical analysis
Baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were summarised for NSAIDs
users and non-users using counts and proportions or mean with standard deviation for
categorical or continuous variables, respectively. We calculated the absolute standardised
difference (aSD) between NSAIDs users and non-users to determine whether important
imbalances were present between groups, with aSD ≥0.1 considered important.
We estimated the cumulative incidence of the primary and secondary composite
outcomes among NSAIDs users versus non-users. We used three outcome models using
logistic regression to estimate odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) of the association of interest. The first model was unadjusted. The second model
included all covariates described above. The third model, considered our primary analysis,
was weighted by propensity scores (PS) using the inverse probability of treatment weight
(IPTW) approach.18 The PS, or probability of receiving NSAIDs, was estimated using
multivariable logistic regression analysis, with the following variables included as
independent variables: age, sex, health insurance type, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia,
diabetes mellitus, malignancy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atherosclerosis,
chronic renal failure, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gastrointestinal
conditions, and use of co-medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, calcium channel
blockers, diuretics, and nitrates). The c-statistic value was used to determine model
discrimination, with a value between 0.6 and 0.8 considered adequate to predict treatment
status based on covariates included.19 The IPTW approach involves weighting the inverse
probability of receiving NSAIDs (1/PS for NSAIDs, and 1/(1−PS) for non-user groups).

In subgroup analyses, we conducted sex- and age-stratified analyses, with age
classified into three groups (<45, 45-65, ≥65 years), for the risk of the primary outcome
associated with NSAIDs use. In addition, we stratified by route of administration (oral versus
intravenous) and by history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, or diabetes mellitus.

Sensitivity analyses
Redefining the exposure ascertainment window
We varied the exposure ascertainment window to 7 days before and including the
third day after the date of cohort entry among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients
prescribed NSAIDs during this period were classified as NSAIDs users whereas those not
prescribed NSAIDs were classified as non-users. Follow-up was initiated from the third day
after the date of cohort entry for both NSAIDs users and non-users and was ended on the
earliest of date of outcome occurrence or end of the study period (April 8, 2020).

Head-to-head comparison of NSAIDs versus paracetamol
To examine the potential effects of confounding by indication, we compared NSAIDs
users to paracetamol users as these two drugs are used for similar indications. Paracetamol
and propacetamol (prodrug of paracetamol used in South Korea) were included in the
paracetamol user group, with both oral and intravenous formulations included
(Supplementary Material 2). We classified patients based on their exposure to NSAIDs or
paracetamol in the 7 days before and including the day of cohort entry, excluding those not
exposed to one of the two drugs of interest and those who received both NSAIDs and
paracetamol during this exposure assessment window. Follow-up was initiated from the date
of cohort entry for both NSAIDs users and paracetamol users and was ended on the date of
outcome occurrence or end of the study period (April 8, 2020), whichever occurred first.

RESULTS
Of 1,824 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in South Korea, there were 354
NSAIDs users (19%) and 1,470 non-users (81%). NSAIDs users were older than non-users
(mean age 54·1 years [standard deviation 17·6 years] versus 47·8 years [standard deviation
19·1 years], aSD 0·43), but had similar sex distribution (58% versus 59% female; aSD 0·01).
Except for history of renal failure, NSAID users had a greater comorbidity burden and greater
use of co-medications compared to non-users (Table 1). The median length of hospitalisation
was 12·0 days among NSAIDs users and 13·0 days among non-users.
There was a total of 76 primary composite events (in-hospital death, ICU admission,
mechanical ventilation use, or sepsis), 23 of which occurred in NSAID users (cumulative
incidence 6·5%) and 53 (3·6%) among non-users. Compared to non-use, NSAIDs use was
associated with an 65% increased risk of the primary composite outcome (IPTW OR 1·65, 95%
CI 1·21-2·24). There were 44 secondary events of cardiovascular or renal complications
(NSAIDs users: 28, 1·9%; non-users: 16, 4·5%). Compared with non-use, use of NSAIDs was
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular or renal complications (IPTW OR 1·87,
95% CI 1·25-2·80) (Table 2). The detailed breakdown of the primary and secondary
outcomes by component of the composites are shown in Supplementary Material 3.
Results of subgroup analyses for the primary outcome revealed no difference
between the association between NSAID use and the risk of our primary composite endpoint
by age group (<45, 45-65, ≥65 years), sex, and histories of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia
(Figure 2). However, use of intravenous NSAIDs was associated with a greater increased risk
(IPTW OR 2·06, 95% CI 1·41-3·00) than use of oral NSAID formulations (IPTW OR 1·42,
95% CI 1·00-2·02; p-for-interaction 0·0486). In addition, the risk of the primary composite
endpoint associated with NSAID use was greater among patients with no history of diabetes
mellitus (IPTW OR 1·90, 95% CI 1·35-2·67) then among those with a history of diabetes

mellitus (IPTW OR 0·75, 95% CI 0·35-1·64; p-for-interaction 0·0151).
Findings from sensitivity analyses remained largely consistent, where the effect
estimate for the primary outcome associated with NSAIDs users, as compared with non-users,
was moderately increased (IPTW OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·06-3·29) when the exposure
ascertainment window was extended to include the third day after hospital admission. When
NSAIDs users were compared to paracetamol users, our sample size was greatly reduced, and
there were no events that occurred in the NSAID group (cumulative incidence for NSAIDs
users: 0·0%; paracetamol users 4·1%). Results of sensitivity analyses for the secondary
outcome were generally consistent to that of our main findings, where when comparing
NSAIDs users to paracetamol users, a null association was observed (IPTW OR 0·92, 95% CI
0·44-1·91) (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based cohort study to have
investigated the association between NSAID use and adverse outcomes among patients with
COVID-19. From 1,824 adults hospitalised with COVID-19 in South Korea, NSAIDs users,
as compared with non-users, had a 65% increased risk of the primary composite outcome of
in-hospital death, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation use, or sepsis (IPTW OR 1·65, 95%
CI 1·21-2·24). Moreover, the risk of cardiovascular or renal complications were further
elevated in NSAIDs users (IPTW OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·25-2·80) compared to non-users. The
association with the primary outcome remained largely consistent when the exposure
ascertainment period used to classify exposure groups was varied (IPTW OR 1·87, 95% CI
1·06-3·29). This study provides novel, real-world evidence that supports the association
between worsened clinical outcomes and NSAIDs users.
To our knowledge, this is the first to date, to assess the safety of NSAIDs among
COVID-19 patients. Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with indirect evidence from
patients with acute respiratory infections or community-acquired pneumonia. A survey from
regional pharmacovigilance centres in France reported 386 cases of serious infectious
complications resulting in hospitalisations or death among patients who received NSAIDs
(ibuprofen, ketoprofen) for acute respiratory infections.20 However, given the limitations of
pharmacovigilance assessments, causality could not be assessed. Moreover, a systematic
review of observational studies found an increased risk of pleuropulmonary complications,
disseminated infection, abscess, prolonged illness, delays in antibiotic prescriptions
associated with NSAIDs in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.21,22 It is possible
that NSAIDs use could have similarly worsened outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
Our findings showed a particularly increased risk of cardiovascular or renal
complications among NSAIDs users (IPTW OR 1·87, 95% CI 1·25-2·80) compared to non13

users. This finding is consistent to the results of two case-crossover studies conducted among
patients with acute respiratory infections, which found that NSAIDs use, as compared with
non-use, was associated with increased risks of ischemic stroke (aOR 2·27, 95% CI 2·00-2·58)
and myocardial infarction (aOR 3·41, 95% CI 2·80-4·16).23,24 In addition to the established
risks of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with NSAIDs use in the general
population,25,26 our findings suggest an elevated risk of cardiovascular complications with
NSAIDs use in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, use of NSAIDs that results in
nephrotoxicity27,28 may be more common among those seriously affected by COVID-19, as
health conditions could be further exacerbated by fever and dehydration.
The underlying pathogenic link between NSAIDs and COVID-19 has yet to be
elucidated. However, one animal study found increased ACE2 expressions with NSAIDs
(ibuprofen)29 in various organs such as the lung, heart, and kidneys.4,30,31 Thus, ACE2
upregulation induced by NSAIDs could theoretically heighten the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2
to worsen clinical outcomes, resulting in multiple organ failure in severe cases. Other
hypothetical mechanisms have also been suggested. NSAIDs could aggravate infections by
upregulating COX-2 in activated B lymphocytes to interfere with antibody productions,32 or
by selectively inhibiting interferon-γ productions that are vital for immunity against foreign
pathogens.33 However, with inconsistent findings from animal studies and the precise
biological mechanisms yet to be understood, it remains unclear as to whether these findings
are readily transferable to humans.
We defined exposure using an approach analogous to an intention-to-treat, with
exposure assessed in the 7 days before and including the day of cohort entry (hospital
admission). We used this approach to avoid time-related biases that could be introduced by
assessing in-hospital NSAID use as the date of prescription was not available for ~50% of inhospital prescriptions. The length of hospital stay not only influences the probability of being

exposed to NSAIDs while hospitalised but is also associated with worse prognosis. However,
with exposure defined using pre-hospital medication use, our exposure assessment was
independent of in-hospital outcomes and the duration of hospital stay. The use of this
exposure definition would bias towards the null hypothesis (e.g., towards no association) as it
does not account for NSAID use during hospitalization, suggesting that the observed
increased risk is a conservative estimate.
Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first population-based
study conducted using all hospitalised patients with COVID-19 to assess the association
between NSAID use and COVID-19 related outcomes. Moreover, we used a nationwide
healthcare database of South Korea that includes information on healthcare utilization of all
COVID-19 cases as of April 8, 2020. Therefore, our findings provide real-world evidence
that is highly generalizable to everyday clinical practice. With its large source population, our
data source was sufficiently large to assess this clinically important issue. In addition, our
findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses that extended the index period.
Our study also has some limitations. First, outcome misclassification is possible.
However, misclassification of in-hospital death is likely to be very small, and the validity of
procedure codes to define ICU admission or mechanical ventilation use are also expected to
be high as these codes are used for reimbursement processes by the health insurance authority.
Also, the positive predictive value of diagnosis codes between claims data and electronic
medical records was previously reported to be 82%,34 and we believe its validity to be greater
as we restricted to hospitalised patients receiving close monitoring. Second, our findings may
have theoretically underestimated the association between NSAIDs users and clinical
outcome due to depletion of susceptible,35 as we included prevalent users of NSAIDs.
However, our study period included the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea,
making it unlikely that patients who were susceptible to adverse COVID-19 related outcomes

were excluded prior to entering our cohort. Third, our results may be affected by confounding
by indication given our use of an unexposed reference group. Finally, residual confounding
from unmeasured confounders (e.g. smoking history, body mass index) may be present due to
inherent limitations of claims data.
In summary, NSAID use was associated with worse COVID-19 related outcomes
compared to non-use among patients hospitalised with COVID-19. While awaiting the results
of confirmatory studies, we suggest NSAIDs be used with caution among patients with
COVID-19 as the harms associated with their use may outweigh their benefits in this patient
population.

Note: HIRA=Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. NSAIDs=nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
The HIRA database of South Korea contains insurance benefit claims and longitudinal history
of all medical services from the entire Korean population of 50 million inhabitants, based on
fee-for-service payment system; thus, data from both inpatient and outpatient settings are
available. A cohort of adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were identified from
confirmed cases of COVID-19. Patients prescribed NSAIDs while hospitalised were
classified as NSAIDs users and those not prescribed NSAIDs were classified as non-users.
We assessed the risk of death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, or
sepsis associated with NSAIDs users compared to non-users
