Summary

30

A dysregulated immune response against coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a critical role in

31

the outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A significant increase in

32

circulating plasmablasts is characteristic of COVID-19 though the underlying mechanisms and

33

its prognostic implications are not known. Here, we demonstrate that in the acute phase of

34

COVID-19, activated PD-1highCXCR5–CD4+ T cells, peripheral helper T cells, (Tph) are

35

significantly increased and promote inflammatory tissue-homing plasmablasts in patients with

36

stable but not severe COVID-19. Analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that plasmablasts in

37

stable patients express higher levels of tissue-homing receptors including CXCR3. The

38

increased Tph cells exhibited “B cell help” signatures similar to that of circulating T follicular

39

helper (cTfh) cells and promoted B cell differentiation in vitro. Compared with cTfh cells, Tph

40

cells produced more IFNγ, inducing tissue-homing chemokine receptors on plasmablasts.

41

Finally, expansion of activated Tph cells was correlated with the frequency of CXCR3+

42

plasmablasts in the acute phase of patients with stable disease. Our results demonstrate a

43

novel role for Tph cells in acute viral immunity by inducing ectopic, antibody secreting

44

plasmablasts.

Introduction

50

SARS-CoV-2 causes a wide spectrum of symptoms ranging from asymptomatic infections

51

to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1,2. COVID-19 is the clinical manifestation of

52

SARS-CoV-2 infection and it has become clear that a dysregulated immune response against

53

SARS-CoV-2 is central in determining disease severity. Increased frequencies of circulating

54

neutrophils with low frequencies of natural killer cells or CD4+ T cells are characteristic of

55

peripheral blood immune profiles observed in patients with COVID-193–6. The generation of a

56

robust antibody response is critical for clearing the virus and alterations in B cell lineages with

57

the expansion of plasmablasts are reported both in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage of

58

patients with COVID-196–8. The increase in plasmablasts, which can represent up to 30% of

59

circulating B cells, is observed in a subset of patients comparable to acute Ebola or dengue

60

virus infections9,10.

61

During the acute phase of COVID-19, activated B cells differentiate into plasmablasts that

62

migrate to target inflammatory tissues, especially the lungs11, indicating that trafficking patterns

63

of plasmablasts are important in the disease course. These plasmablasts express tissue-

64

specific chemokines together with adhesion molecules and produce organ-specific protective

65

antibodies for viral control12,13. This rapid antibody response is critical as the early containment

66

of virus reduces the risk of cytokine storm syndrome with excessive accumulation of immune

67

cells in the lung parenchyma with ARDS. Despite this important role, the control of expansion

68

and migration capacity of plasmablasts in patients with COVID-19 remains poorly understood.

69

During the adaptive immune response, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells play crucial roles

70

in B cell differentiation14,15. Circulating CXCR5+CD4+ T cells, termed cTfh cells, support B cell

71

differentiation in blood while Tfh cells located in lymphoid tissues allow B cell differentiation in

72

lymph nodes16. Intriguingly, while the plasmablast response correlates with the cTfh responses

73

in subjects recovered from COVID-1917, there is no correlation between the frequency of cTfh

74

cells and that of plasmablasts in symptomatic patients with COVID-196. Moreover, in the acute

75

phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a striking absence of germinal centers in lymphoid organs

76

was reported, similar to SARS, but activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-expressing B

77

cells are still preserved18. These data suggest that activated helper T cells other than Tfh cells

78

support the differentiation of B cells at extra-follicular regions in acute phase of COVID-19.

79

To examine the mechanism of T cell regulation of plasmablast differentiation in COVID-

80

19, we investigated the characteristics of B and T cells in patients by single cell RNA-seq

81

(scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry datasets. Here, we report that PD-1highCXCR5–CD4+ T cells,

82

so called peripheral helper T (Tph) cells19,20, are significantly increased and positively

83

correlated with the frequency of plasmablasts in peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19.

84

These Tph cells exhibit “B cell help” signatures to a similar degree as cTfh cells, but also

85

express more inflammatory chemokine receptors including CCR2 and CCR5. In vitro

86

experiments indicate that PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells have higher IFNγ production, which

87

promotes CXCR3 expression and differentiation of plasmablasts. Finally, we demonstrate that

88

CXCR3+ tissue-homing plasmablasts are significantly increased in patients with stable

89

COVID-19 while they are decreased in patients with severe disease. These findings provide

90

a mechanism for the increase of plasmablasts apart from Tfh cells in the acute phase of

91

COVID-19. Thus, the induction of plasmablast trafficking to inflammatory sites by activated

92

PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells is important for disease control in the acute phase of COVID-19.

Results

95

Expanded plasmablasts express higher tissue-homing molecules in patients with

96

stable COVID-19

97

We first confirmed that the frequency of plasmablasts is significantly increased in the

98

peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 by flow cytometry3,21 (Figure 1a, Supplemental

99

Table 1, 2). To further understand the characteristics of B cells in patients with COVID-19, we

100

next analyzed previously collected scRNA-seq data5 and sub-clustered B cells (total 13550

101

cells from 31 samples) into eight clusters according to gene expression (Figure 1b, 1c,

102

Supplemental Figure 1a, 1b, Supplemental Table 3). We identified naïve B cells

103

(MS4A1+IGHD+), germinal center-like B cells (MS4A1+NEIL1+; GC-like B cells), intermediate

104

memory B cells (IGHD+CD27+), memory B cells (MS4A1+CD27+), and two plasma cells

105

clusters: plasmablasts (MZB1+CD38+) and Ki67+ plasmablasts (MZB1+CD38+MKI67+), in

106

accordance with a previous report22 (plasmablasts; 912 cells and Ki67+ plasmablasts; 537

107

cells). GC-like B cells also express CD923,24 (Supplemental Figure 1b). Additionally, we were

108

able to identify two additional clusters, namely, FCRL5+ B cells (MS4A1+FCRL5+) and CD1c+

109

B cells (MS4A1+CD1C+). FCRL5+ B cells also express higher levels of ITGAX and ZEB2 than

110

the other B cells, and this cluster was similar with atypical B cells or double-negative (DN)

111

cells25–27 (Supplemental Figure 1b). CD1c+ B cells express higher levels of CD52 compared

112

to the other B cell subclusters, which implies that gene expression signatures of this cluster

113

resemble marginal zone-like B cells28,29. There was no significant difference in the clonal

114

diversity or the frequency of unmutated clones between the two clusters of plasmablasts

115

(Supplemental Figure 1c, 1d). Both plasmablast clusters expressed IgG, which indicated that

116

they had undergone class-switching (Figure 1d). Ki67+ plasmablasts had a significantly lower

117

frequency of somatic hypermutations (SHM) in COVID-19 subjects compared with the other

118

plasmablasts (Figure 1e). The proportion of GC-like B cells was significantly decreased and

119

FCRL5+ B cells were increased in patients with progressive COVID-19. These observations

120

imply that the extrafollicular response is related to B cell activation in patients with COVID-

121

1930 (Supplemental Figure 1e). To further examine the characteristics of each single cell RNA

122

cluster, we determined gene expression levels as related to B cell function31 (Supplemental

123

Figure 1f). It was of interest that the expression level of CXCR3, the receptor necessary for

124

trafficking to sites of inflammation, was upregulated in plasmablast clusters, especially in Ki67+

125

plasmablasts. Homing receptors32, which promote homing to lymph nodes (CCR7, SELL),

126

were highly expressed in healthy control plasmablasts, while Ki67+ plasmablasts in stable

127

COVID-19 patients expressed tissue-homing molecules (CXCR3, CCR2) (Figure 1f, 1g).

128

Taken together, Ki67+ plasmablasts trafficking to inflammatory sites are a unique population

129

expanded in stable patients in contrast to patients with severe COVID-19, and these acute

130

plasmablast responses might be beneficial for hosts to prevent viral expansion at inflammatory

131

tissues.

132
133

PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells are significantly increased in patients with COVID-19 and

134

have a unique gene expression profile

135

Tfh cells provide essential B cell help during the adaptive immune response, and

136

circulating Tfh (cTfh) cells share functional properties with Tfh cells16. Notably, PD-

137

1highCXCR5– Tph cells, that are reported to be associated with extra follicular B cell

138

differentiation20, were significantly increased in the blood of COVID-19 patients, in addition to

139

significant increase in PD1high/intCXCR5+ Tfh cells (Figure 2a, Supplemental Figure 2a, 2b).

140

Tph cells were barely detected in healthy blood and moreover, correlated in COVID-19

141

patients with the frequency of circulating plasmablasts (Figure 2b, Supplemental Figure 2c)

142

but not with clinical characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), and sex) (Supplemental

143

Figure 3a-c). The increase of PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells and the positive correlation between

144

these cells and plasmablasts in the acute phase of COVID-19 patients were validated from

145

another dataset6 (Supplemental Figure 4a-c).

146

To further characterize these T helper populations, six subsets of memory CD4+ T cells

147

(CD45RA– CD4+ T cells), categorized by PD-1 and CXCR5 expression levels, were sorted and

148

gene expression profiles were examined by bulk RNA-seq (Figure 2c). Principal component

149

analysis (PCA) placed PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells at a distinctive position relative to other

150

subsets, indicating a unique gene expression profile. PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells had similar

151

expression of Tfh-related genes19 compared to PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells and expressed

152

molecules including MAF, TIGIT, SLAMF6, and IL21, which are important for Tfh functions

153

(Figure 2d). PD-1intCXCR5+ Tfh cells also expressed these genes, but had less ICOS

154

expression than PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cell, suggesting that PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells are more

155

activated cTfh cells14. We identified 100 genes that were differentially expressed in PD-

156

1highCXCR5– Tph cells compared with PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells (|Log2FC| >1, FDR <0.05)

157

(Figure 2e); PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells showed marked upregulation of tissue-resident

158

chemokine receptors, including CCR2, CCR5 and CX3CR1 (Figure 2f, Supplemental Figure

159

3d). Additionally, we surveyed the expression of T cell lineage genes, and found that Th1-like

160

signatures (CXCR3, TBX21, STAT1) were highly expressed in PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells

161

(Supplemental Figure 3e). Thus, PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells exhibit “B cell help” signatures to

162

a similar degree as cTfh cells, but with a unique gene expression profile.

163
164

PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells promote B cell differentiation, and produce more IFNγ than

165

PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells

166

We examined whether PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells promote B cell differentiation in

167

vitro. As with PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells, these cells induce memory B cells into plasmablasts,

168

and initiated IgG production (Figure 3a, 3b). Stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies

169

induced greater IFNγ and IL-10 production from PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells (Figure 3c), which

170

is of interest as IFNγ is known to upregulate CXCR3 expression during B cell differentiation33.

171

We observed that CXCR3 expression on plasmablasts was upregulated in a dose dependent

172

manner by IFNγ while IL-10 was not (Figure 3d, 3e). Moreover, besides CXCR3, other

173

inflammatory tissue-homing receptors such as CCR2 were upregulated, but CXCR4 was not

174

(Figure 3f). These data indicate that PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells promote B cell differentiation

175

and have a capacity to induce plasmablasts which express homing-molecules for

176

inflammatory tissues via IFNγ production.

177

The proportion of activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells are significantly increased in

178

stable as compared to severely ill patients with COVID-19 and are positively

179

correlated with CXCR3+ plasmablasts

180

To investigate the characteristics of PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells in vivo, we evaluated the

181

specific gene signatures of this subset (Supplemental Table 4). Compared to the other five

182

subsets in memory CD4+ T cells, CXCR6, LAG3, and PRR5L were significantly upregulated,

183

while CHD7, ZBTB20, ZNF251, GRK25, and GPRASP1 were significantly downregulated in

184

PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells (Figure 4a, 4b). Flow cytometry analysis also showed the same

185

trend of upregulation of LAG3 and CXCR6 expressions (Supplemental Figure 5a, 5b).

186

Embedding these gene lists with CD4+ T cell clusters from our scRNA-seq data set5, we found

187

that dividing CD4+ T cells best fit with these signatures (Figure 4c). We previously reported

188

that dividing CD4+ T cells share the characteristics of HLA-DR+CD38+ activated T cells5, and

189

indeed, more than half of the activated CD4+ T cells were in the PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cell

190

population (Figure 4d). In contrast, 15% of PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells exhibited an activated

191

state among all COVID-19 samples (data not shown), with a significantly higher proportion in

192

patients with stable disease as compared to patients with progressive disease (Figure 4e). We

193

confirmed that these observations were not highly confounded by known risk factors for

194

disease severity, such as age, BMI, and sex (Supplemental Figure 5c-e).

195

Finally, we observed a positive correlation between activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells

196

and CXCR3+ plasmablasts (Figure 4f). There was no difference in the proportion of PD-

197

1highCXCR5– Tph cells between stable and progressive patients at baseline, but interestingly

198

they increased in progressive patient over time and reached significance at two weeks after

199

the baseline (Supplemental Figure 5f, Supplemental Table 5). In contrast, the significantly

200

elevated frequency of activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells in stable patients at baseline

201

became less significant over time (Supplemental Figure 5g). These data demonstrate that

202

prompt increased HLA-DR+CD38+ activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells are one of the early

203

responses in stable patients, which is also positively correlated with tissue-homing CXCR3+

204

plasmablasts.

Discussion

207

Here, we performed a bidirectional-analyses between T cells and B cells in patients with

208

COVID-19 by both bulk and scRNA-seq studies with B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire analysis

209

and in vitro assays. PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells were increased among the PBMCs of patients

210

with COVID-19 and were positively correlated with the frequency of plasmablasts. These PD-

211

1highCXCR5– Tph cells had a similar gene profile with cTfh cells focused on “B cell help”

212

signatures and promoted B cell differentiation in vitro. Moreover, CXCR3+ tissue-homing

213

plasmablasts were markedly increased in patients with stable but not severely ill patients with

214

COVID-19 where we hypothesize that activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells promoted these

215

plasmablasts via IFNγ production. Thus, these data suggest that tissue homing plasmablasts

216

are important for the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 (Supplemental Figure 6).

217

PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells were first described in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis

218

and the peripheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)19,34, indicating

219

an important role in autoimmune diseases with tissue specific, ectopic antibody production.

220

Our data extend those findings, demonstrating a role for these Tph cells in acute viral

221

infections. We show that not only PD-1high/intCXCR5+ cTfh cells, but also PD-1highCXCR5– Tph

222

cells are significantly increased in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients supporting the

223

expansion of plasmablasts. One of the common signals between the acute phase of COVID-

224

19 and chronic autoimmune conditions such as SLE are type-1 interferon (IFN)

225

signatures5,35,36. Type-1 IFN (IFN-I) is reported to downregulate CXCR5 expression on human

226

T cells37 and our recent data showed that IFN-I upregulates PD-1 expression and

227

downregulates CXCR5 expression in an in vitro assay38. Intriguingly, most of the genes unique

228

to PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells such as CXCR6, LAG3, ZBTB20, and CHD7 had the same

229

directions for their expression levels after type-1 IFN stimulation38. These data indicate that

230

type-1 IFN might be one of the key signals to induce these Tph cells.

231

Patients with COVID-19 have a striking loss of GCs in lymph nodes with underlying

232

extrafollicular B cell responses, particularly in severe cases18,39. Our scRNA-seq data showed

233

an increase in FCRL5+ B cells in progressive patients (Supplemental Figure 1e), which

234

supports this observation. Our results highlight the characteristics of PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells

235

as: 1) lacking CXCR5 expression, important for the entry in GCs; 2) producing more IFNγ that

236

is similar to T cells residing in the extra-follicular regions of lymph nodes18; and 3) exhibiting

237

highly overlapping signatures with dividing CD4+ T cells that are positively correlated with the

238

proportion of Ki67+ plasmablasts40, which had lower SHM frequencies in our scRNA-seq data.

239

These findings suggest that circulating PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells may be the counterpart of T

240

cells which promote more extra-follicular responses20. On the other hand, we could detect

241

these T cells in peripheral blood of stable COVID-19 patients despite the lack of extrafollicular

242

signatures in such patients. In acute viral infections, extra-follicular responses are thought to

243

bridge between innate- and GC-responses of B cells41. Many effector molecules control the

244

switch between GC- and extra-follicular responses42, which is dynamically changed in the

245

acute phase of COVID-19. Though it might be difficult to conclude the direct relationship

246

between extra-follicular responses and blood PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells from our dataset, the

247

longitudinal assessment of these T cells together with their spatial analysis with B cells in

248

lymph nodes will clarify these relationships.

249

In the Salmonella infected mouse model, the antibody responses important for the

250

bacteria clearance are established by day 3 through 5 weeks, and GC formation is observed

251

approximately one month after infection, indicating GC formation is not necessary for these

252

early responses43. Similarly, in COVID-19 human samples, earlier antibody responses are

253

likely to be associated with better recovery44,45, which is consistent with our findings that the

254

rapid induction of inflammatory tissue-homing plasmablasts was linked with a better clinical

255

outcome. Additionally, we detected that PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells in the activated state had

256

the capacity to support the induction of tissue-homing plasmablasts, and these T cells were

257

significantly increased in stable patients at the earlier stage of disease. The significant

258

difference in the frequency of activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells between stable and

259

progressive patients disappears over time, indicating that the prompt induction of activated

260

PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells might be critical for the promotion of tissue homing plasmablasts to

261

effectively remove virus from inflamed tissues and thus linked with better clinical outcomes.

262

Not only sex differences3, but also genetic backgrounds are reported to be related to T cell

263

activation46,47 and further analyses combined with these factors will lead to the more precise

264

identification of patients at higher risk, and thus expected to be valuable for the development

265

SARS-CoV-2 and other IFN-I inducing viral infections. In summary, our data implicate PD-

269

1highCXCR5– Tph cells as triggering acute protective plasmablast responses with direct

270

relevance in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Moreover, these data shed light on how T cells can

271

affect B cell differentiation in COVID-19 and provide potential insights into the role of PD-

272

1highCXCR5– Tph cells on a variety of immune-mediated diseases with possible contribution of

273

aberrant T-B interaction, including chronic autoimmune diseases.

Ethics Statement

277

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Yale School of Medicine

278

(2000027291REG and FWA00002571, Protocol ID. 2000027690). Informed consent was

279

obtained from all enrolled patients, healthcare workers and healthy donors.

280
281

Patients and Samples

282

Adult patients (≥18 years old) admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital, positive for SARS-CoV-

283

2 by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, and able to provide informed

284

consent (surrogate consent accepted) were eligible (Supplemental Table 1). Individuals with

285

active chemotherapy against cancers, pregnant patients, patients with background

286

hematological abnormalities, patients with autoimmune diseases and patients with a history

287

of organ transplantation and on immunosuppressive agents, were excluded from this study.

288

For the characterization of T cells and B cells, the flow data deposited in the Yale IMPACT

289

Biorepository study were analyzed as described elsewhere3,21. All the patients were admitted

290

between 30 March and 27 May 2020 and hospitalized. Only the baseline data were analyzed

291

except for the analysis of time kinetics (Supplemental Table 2). All the experiments were

292

performed on fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and samples were drawn

293

on the average of 11.8 days after first symptoms. 92 patients with COVID-19 and 64 COVID-

294

19-uninfected healthcare workers (HCs) were enrolled. COVID-19 patients who required

295

admission to the ICU had been classified as “progressive” and 27.8% of them were expired.

296

The other patients classified as “stable” were all discharged without ICU admission. For the

297

patients who are 90 years-old or older, their ages were protected health information, and ‘90’

298

was put as the surrogate value for the analyses. HCs were all negative in both PCR and

299

serology tests.

300

Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) was performed on cryopreserved PBMC samples of

301

10 patients with COVID-19 following the same criteria as above and 13 age- and sex- matched

302

controls. All the samples were drawn on the average of 11.7 days after first symptoms. Control

303

samples were already collected before the first report of COVID-19 in 2018. From eight of ten

304

patients with COVID-19, PBMC samples from two different time points had been analyzed.

305

Four patients had been classified as “progressive”, who required admission to the ICU, and

306

the other six patients classified as “stable” who were hospitalized and all discharged, and the

307

same criteria as flow data. We have described the full cohort elsewhere5.

308

All the other experiments which include in vitro experiments and bulk RNA-seq were

309

performed with fresh PBMCs at the baseline. All the patients were admitted between 21st July

310

and 22nd Jan 2021.

311
312

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolation

313

PBMCs were prepared from whole blood by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Histopaque (Sigma)

314

in the Yale IMPACT Biorepository study and Lymphoprep (Stemcell) in other experiments).

315

The PBMC layer was collected into a new 50-ml tube and washed twice with PBS to remove

316

any remaining Lymphoprep/Histopaque. As for scRNA-seq and flow cytometry, the pelleted

317

cells were treated with ACK buffer for red cell lysis. All the other experiments including bulk

318

RNA-seq samples were processed without lysis buffer.

319
320

Flow Cytometry and sorting

321

In the Yale IMPACT Biorepository study, the staining was performed mainly in two separate

322

panels for (1) T cell surface staining and (2) B cell surface staining. PBMCs were plated at 1-

323

2 × 106 cells in a 96-well U-bottom plate, and resuspended in Live/Dead Fixable Aqua

324

(ThermoFisher) for 20 min at 4 °C. Following a wash, cells were then blocked with Human

325

TruStan FcX (BioLegend) for 10 min at room temperature. Cocktails of desired staining

326

antibodies were directly added to this mixture for 30 min at room temperature. Before analysis,

327

cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C. We

328

have described the detailed methods elsewhere3. The adopted antibodies and their clones

329

were as follows. Anti-CD3 (UCHT1), anti-CD19 (SJ25C1), anti-CD4 (SK3), anti-CD45RA

330

(HI100), anti-PD-1 (EH12.2H7), anti-CD38 (HIT2), anti-CXCR5 (RF8B2), anti-CXCR3

331

(1C6/CXCR3), anti-CD20 (2H7), anti-CD27 (M-T271), anti-IgD (IA6-2).

332

For other experiments, freshly isolated PBMCs were stained with cocktails of desired

333

staining antibodies for 30 minutes at 4°C. Specific T cell and B cell subsets were sorted on a

334

Sony MA900 cell sorter. The adopted antibodies and their clones were as follows. Anti-CD4

335

(OKT4), anti-CD19 (HIB19), anti-CD20 (2H7), anti-CD27 (M-T271), anti-CD38 (HIT2), anti-

336

T-B-cell co-culture experiments

342

Co-culture experiments were performed referenced as described previously19. In brief, sorted

343

T cell populations (5000-10000 cells) from PBMCs of patients with COVID-19 were co-cultured

344

with autologous CD20+CD27+ memory B cells at a ratio of 1:3 in 200 µl of RPMI 1640 medium

345

(Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 nM L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml

346

penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Lonza), stimulated with SEB (1 µg/ml) and LPS (1 µg/ml)

347

for 7 days. Supernatants were collected, and total IgG (Invitrogen) was measured by ELISA.

348

Cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry, with plasma cells defined as

349

CD27highCD138+ cells.

B cell differentiation in vitro

352

We extracted PBMCs from healthy volunteers. After the isolation of CD19+ B cells from

353

PBMCs using Human B cell isolation kit (Stemcell Technologies), CD20+CD27+ memory B

354

cells were sorted on a FACS Aria (BD Biosciences) and stimulated with CD40L (0.05 µg/ml)

355

(Enzo), IL-21 (20 ng/ml) (R&D systems) and other cytokines (all from R&D systems) in culture

356

medium the same as above. After 7 days, CD27highCD138+ plasma cells were sorted for gene

357

expression analysis by qPCR.

358
359

T cell stimulation in vitro

360

We extracted PBMCs from patients with COVID-19. Each subset of memory CD4+ T cells

361

based on the expression levels of PD-1 and CXCR5 were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28

362

(each 1 µg/ml; BD Biosciences) for 48 hrs and cytokine levels were measured by ELISA (all

363

from R&D systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1% Triton X-100 for 60

364

minutes at room temperature was added before ELISA to reduce risk from any potential virus

365

in the supernatant48.

Quantitative PCR

368

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s

369

instructions. cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen). cDNAs

370

were amplified with Taqman probes (Taqman Gene Expression Arrays) and TaqMan Fast

371

Advanced Master Mix on a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) according

372

to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA expression was measured relative to B2M

373

expression. The adopted Taqman probes were as follows. CXCR3 (Hs01847760_s1), CXCR4

374

(Hs00607978_s1), CCR2 (Hs00356601_m1).

375
376

Single cell RNA-seq data processing

377

A PBMC scRNA-seq data set which had been previously performed and reported by us5 was

378

reanalyzed. In brief, single cell barcoding of PBMC and library construction had been

379

performed using the 10x Chromium NextGEM 5 prime kit according to manufacturer's

380

instructions. Libraries had been sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. Raw reads

381

had been demultiplexed and processed using Cell Ranger (v3.1) mapping to the GRCh38

382

(Ensembl 93) reference genome. Resulting gene-cell matrices had been analyzed using the

383

package Seurat49,50 in the software R (v3.6.2) including integration of data, clustering, multiplet

384

identification and cell type annotation. We have described the detailed methods elsewhere5.

385

The annotated R object was used for sub-clustering of B cells.

386

The three cell populations, "Memory B cells", "Naïve B cells " and "Plasma cells" in

387

total PBMCs were re-clustered to obtain a finer cell type granularity. To remove batch- and

388

single-donor effects, we integrated all 31 samples of these populations into one dataset using

389

reference-based anchor finding and integration workflow. We chose 2 healthy donor samples

390

(C27 and C32) and 2 COVID-19 samples (NS1B and TS3A), which have enough B cell

391

numbers, as references for anchor finding and integration. The top 2000 variable genes were

392

selected, and integration anchors were determined by “FindIntegrationAnchors” without k.filter

393

for low cell numbers in some samples. These anchors were used to integrate the data using

394

the “IntegrateData” function with top 30 dimensions and scaled. The top 17 PCs were used

395

for data integration and downstream steps, along with a clustering resolution of 0.4. Cluster- 14 -

396

specific gene expression profiles were established using the “FindAllMarkers” per cluster and

397

per subset to annotate the clusters. Doublet clusters were determined by co-expression of

398

heterogeneous lineage markers (e.g., MS4A1 and CD3). These clusters were removed prior

399

to finalizing the UMAPs.

400
401

B cell receptor repertoire analysis

402

B cell receptor (BCR) V(D)J repertoire data processing, clonal clustering, and unmutated

403

germline ancestor sequence reconstruction was previously performed in5. Briefly, V(D)J

404

genes aligned to the IMGT/GENE-DB v3.1.2651 germline reference database using IgBLAST

405

v.1.15.052. Cells with multiple IGH V(D)J sequences were assigned to the most abundant

406

IGH V(D)J sequence by UMI count, and ties were broken by the first identified heavy chain.

407

Non-functional sequences were removed. V(D)J sequences within each patient were

408

grouped into clonal clusters by first partitioning based on common IGHV gene annotations,

409

IGHJ gene annotations, and junction lengths. Within these groups, sequences differing from

410

one another by a length normalized Hamming distance of 0.15 within the junction region

411

were defined as clones by single-linkage clustering using Change-O v.1.0.053. Germline

412

sequences were reconstructed for each clone with the D segment and N/P regions masked

413

(replaced with “N” nucleotides) using the CreateGermlines.py function within Change-O

414

v.1.0.0.

415

Somatic hypermutation frequency was calculated using SHazaM v1.0.2.99954 as the

416

frequency of non-ambiguous nucleotide differences along the IGHV gene segment (IMGT

417

positions 1-312) between each sequence and its inferred germline ancestor. To identify

418

unmutated B cell clones of different cell types and isotypes, B cell clones were separated by

419

cell type and isotype and considered “unmutated” if the median somatic hypermutation

420

frequency of their constituent sequences was < 1%. This cutoff was also used in5,55. To

421

quantify B cell clonal diversity, we calculated Simpson’s diversity within each patient for

422

plasmablast subsets using the alphaDiversity function of Alakazam v1.0.2.99953. To account

423

for differences in sequence depth, the number of sequences within each patient were down-

424

sampled to the same number of sequences, and the mean of 100 such re-sampling

425

repetitions was reported. Only patients with at least 30 B cells were included in diversity

426

calculations. All statistical analyses of BCR sequences were performed with R (v3.6.1).

cDNA and library preparation and sequencing:

431

RNAs were isolated using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN) and cDNAs were generated

432

using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for sequencing (Takara/Clontech).

433

Barcoded libraries were generated by the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina)

Bulk RNA-seq data analysis:

438

Low quality ends (less than phred score=30) and short read length (minimum length=30)

was trimmed using PRINSEQ++56 (version1.2). Trimmed reads were aligned to the hg38

440

genome reference using STAR57 (v2.7.1), and subsequently RSEM (RNA-Seq by

441

Expectation-Maximization)58 was used to count reads mapping to the genes from Ensembl

Schematic model of T-B interactions in a) healthy donors, b) stable COVID-19

patients, and c) progressive COVID-19 patients in acute phase.

610

Under healthy conditions, we can detect few plasmablasts and PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells. In

611

the acute phase, PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells increased in COVID-19 patients and are related

612

to the promotion of plasmablasts. Among patients with COVID-19, stable groups can increase

613

activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells quickly, which can produce IFNγ more than PD-

614

1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells, and promote inflammatory-tissue homing plasmablasts at the proper

615

timing. Progressive COVID-19 patients can also increase activated PD-1highCXCR5–Tph cells

616

but delayed, which lead to insufficient promotion of plasmablasts at proper timing and worse

617

clinical outcome.

Figure 3 The functions of PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells
PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells promote B cell differentiation and produce IFNγ much higher than cTfh cells, which affects the expression
levels of tissue-homing receptors on plasmablasts. a-b, Each T cell subset and autologous CD20+CD27+ B cells were sorted and
co-cultured with SEB and LPS for 7 days (n=5, COVID-19 patients). Representative flow data of CD27highCD138+ plasma cells after
co-culture (a). IgG concentrations in supernatants of co-cultures were evaluated by One-way ANOVA with Dunn’ s multiple
comparisons tests (b). c, Sorted T cells (n=4, COVID-19 patients) were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 (each 1 µg/ml) for 48 hrs, then
cytokine production levels were measured (IFNγ, IL-17A, IL-10). d-f, Sorted CD20+CD27+ memory B cells (n=5, healthy donors)
were cultured with CD40L (0.05 ng/ml), IL-21 (20ng/ml), and IL-10 (10 ng/ml) or different concentration of IFNγ (0 , 3, 10, 30 ng/ml)
for 7 days (n=5, healthy controls). Representative histogram of flow data for CXCR3 expression on plasma cells (d, left), CXCR3
gMFI was evaluated by One-way ANOVA with Tukey’ s multiple comparisons tests (d, right). After 7 days in culture, CD19+CD27
+
CD138+ plasma cells were sorted and gene expression measured relative to B2M by qPCR (e, f). The expression levels were
evaluated by One-way ANOVA with Tukey’ s multiple comparisons tests (c-f).

Supplemental Figure 6 Schematic model of T-B interactions in a) healthy donors, b) stable COVID-19 patients, and c)
progressive COVID-19 patients in acute phase
Under healthy conditions, we can detect few plasmablasts and PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells. In the acute phase, PD-1highCXCR5– Tph
cells increased in COVID-19 patients and are related to the promotion of plasmablasts. Among patients with COVID-19, stable
groups can increase activated PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells quickly, which can produce IFNγ more than PD-1highCXCR5+ Tfh cells, and
promote inflammatory-tissue homing plasmablasts at the proper timing. Progressive COVID-19 patients can also increase activated
PD-1highCXCR5– Tph cells but delayed, which lead to insufficient promotion of plasmablasts at proper timing and worse clinical
outcome.
