Abstract

47

Background and Objective

48

Hypertension is a common comorbidity of patients with COVID-19, SARS or HIV

49

infection. Those patients are often treated with commonly used antiviral and

50

antihypertensive agents concomitantly, such as ritonavir-containing regimens and

51

nifedipine. Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, when nifedipine is combined

52

with ritonavir-containing antiviral drugs, there is a potential risk of drug-drug

53

interaction. This study aimed to provide guidance on nifedipine treatment during and

54

after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens using a physiologically-

55

based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis.

56

Methods

57

A PBPK/PD model was developed for nifedipine by the software of Simcyp®, and the

58

model was verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine

59

exposures and systolic blood pressure were assessed for instant-release, sustained-

60

release and controlled-release formulations. Moreover, various nifedipine regimens

61

were investigated when co-administrated with and withdrawing ritonavir.

62

Results

63

PBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established.

64

The model predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine were comparable to the

65

published data. Ratios of predicted versus observed AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine of nifedipine

66

were within 0.70- to 1.83-fold. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of

67

ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC

68

by 44.94-50.77 times at steady state. Moreover, nifedipine dose reduced to 1/16 of the

69

regular dose during ritonavir co-administration could lead to severe hypotension.

70

Conclusions

71

Ritonavir had a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive

72

effect of nifedipine. It is not recommended for patients to take nifedipine and ritonavir-

73

containing regimens simultaneously.

Introduction

78

The calcium channel blocker (CCB) nifedipine is effective in the treatment of

79

hypertension, angina pectoris and other cardiovascular diseases [1, 2]. European, the

80

United States and Chinese guidelines of hypertension treatment recommend calcium

81

channel blockers (CCB) as the first-line drug therapy [3-5]. The advantages of

82

nifedipine use are rapid onset of action and lack of central nervous system depression.

83

Moreover, comparing to the immediate release (IR) formulation, new once-daily

84

formulations reduce the frequency of nifedipine administration, and thus improve

85

patient compliance. Nifedipine is quickly absorbed after oral administration with peak

86

plasma concentrations occurring in 30 minutes for the IR formulation [6]. It is well

87

absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, whereas the oral bioavailability of the parent

88

drug is only 45% [7] which suggests that nifedipine undergoes extensive first pass

89

metabolism along the intestine and liver[8, 9]. It is almost completely metabolized by

90

cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in human body [10]. Therefore, co-administering

91

nifedipine with the strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 may increase its plasma concentrations,

92

leading to the risk of hypotension, hyperglycemia, and conduction disturbances [11].

93

In recent years, viral infections including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),

94

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), Middle East

95

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-

96

nCoV) have risen as a global threat to public health. Hypertension, the leading risk

97

factor for mortality worldwide, is a growing problem in viral infections patients [12,

98

13]. And many virus-infected patients with hypertension are treated with antiviral and

99

antihypertensive agents concomitantly, such as ritonavir (RTV) -containing regimens

100

and nifedipine.

101

The antiviral drug RTV is a protease inhibitor which can be used as a booster to

102

increase the blood levels of other antiviral medicines including amprenavir, atazanavir,

103

darunavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir. Among them,

104

lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is the most widely used for the treatment of HIV[14] and is

105

regarded as a potential candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 [15-17].

106

RTV is a strong time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Extensive investigations

107

have proved that RTV has significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4

108

substrates, such as saquinavir[18], quinine[19] and atazanavir[20]. Consequently, co-

109

prescription of these drugs leads to the substantial increase of the blood concentration

110

of CYP3A substrates and increase the risk of adverse drug reactions. Regarding the

111

DDI between nifedipine and RTV, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–

112

approved label states that caution is warranted, clinical monitoring of patients is

113

recommended and a dose decrease may be needed for nifedipine when co-administered

114

with RTV[21]. But the detailed guidance is not provided. Therefore, there is an urgent

115

need to address how to adjust the dose of nifedipine when co-administered with RTV-

116

containing regimens especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

117

To our knowledge, there have been no reports on DDI between nifedipine and RTV

118

except for a case report[22] which showed that co-administration of nifedipine with

119

RTV may significantly increase nifedipine exposure, leading to severe hypotension and

120

renal failure in a patient with HIV. Therefore, it is risky and costly to investigate the

121

DDI between nifedipine and RTV through traditional clinical trials. While

122

physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can be of great value for the

123

assessment of the various dose regimens and analysis of the dynamic change in plasma

124

concentrations over time for the victim and inhibitor drugs, and the exploration of the

125

magnitude of DDI[16]. Moreover, PBPK models could link with pharmacodynamic

126

(PD) models to predict changes in drug effect due to extrinsic or intrinsic factors that

127

affect the drug PK[23].

128

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of RTV on nifedipine

129

exposure and systolic blood pressure (SBP) via a PBPK/PD modeling approach. And to

130

apply the model to assess various nifedipine dose regimens in the presence or absence

131

of RTV in order to design the regimen for nifedipine during and after co-administration

132

with RTV-containing therapies.

Methods

134

Nifedipine PBPK model development

135

The PBPK model for nifedipine was built in Simcyp® simulator (version 16, Certara

136

Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, USA). Nifedipine is a Biopharmaceutics Classification

137

System Class II drug, with low solubility and high intestinal permeability[24]. It is

138

predominantly eliminated through CYP3A4 metabolism[24, 25]. Nifedipine

139

physicochemical properties (LogP and pKa), absorption, distribution, metabolism and

140

elimination (ADME) parameters are summarized in Table 1.

141

The PK profiles for nifedipine were predicted using the Simcyp® nifedipine

142

compound file, with a minimal PBPK distribution model and elimination pathway

143

characterized by enzyme kinetics. There are three available nifedipine formulations on

144

the market, namely IR, sustained-release (SR) and controlled-release (CR) formulation.

145

This study investigated all three formulations. The first order model was used to

146

describe the absorption process of nifedipine IR. For the SR and CR nifedipine, the oral

147

absorption was described by the Advanced Dissolution, Absorption and Metabolism

148

(ADAM) model within Simcyp® using in vitro dissolution data. Dissolution data of the

149

CR and SR formulation were obtained from literature [27] and package insert of

150

Adalat®[28], respectively.

152

Nifedipine PBPK model verification

153

IR formulation PBPK model of nifedipine IR was verified using clinical DDI data

154

with CYP3A inhibitors/inducers. The predictive performance of DDI for nifedipine

155

PBPK model was investigated by using the perpetrators of diltiazem and rifampicin,

156

which all have the built in compound files in Simcyp®. Observed data of nifedipine PK

157

from six published DDI studies [1, 2, 29-32] was captured using GetData Graph

158

Digitizer (version 2.22, www.getdata-graph-digitizer.com). Details of these clinical

159

DDI studies were summarized in Table 2.

160

SR and CR formulations The PBPK models for SR and CR formulations were

161

also verified with PK data from a single-dose administration in healthy volunteers [33,

162

34]. The predicted area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios of

163

nifedipine were compared with the respective observations.

164

The accuracy of prediction was measured by calculating the fold error between

165

predicted and observed, described as (Eq.1). Cmax and AUC ratios were estimated for

166

all three formulations. Evaluation criteria is the ratio of predicted AUC and Cmax values

167

are within 2-fold namely, 0.5≤ratio≤2.0 of the observed values.

Nifedipine-RTV DDI prediction
First, the changes of CYP3A4 abundance in liver and intestine with or without RTV
were predicted in order to explore the inhibition of RTV on CYP3A4.

172

Then, the established nifedipine PBPK model was used to predict multiple dosing

173

of nifedipine when co-administered with RTV-containing regimens. Since RTV is the

174

only clinical inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4 within the regimen, only RTV was

175

simulated as a surrogate for the RTV-containing regimens [35]. In addition, the PBPK

176

model of RTV has been already verified by simulating its inhibition effects on the PK

177

profiles of CYP3A4 substrates [36]. Thus, the RTV model was not herein verified.

179

alone was simulated to reach the steady state, followed by the combination of 100 mg

180

Q12H RTV and 10 mg Q12H nifedipine for 14 days. The commonly used regimen for

181

SR and CR formulations 30 mg Q12H and 60 mg every 24 hours (Q24H), respectively

182

were also simulated. Considering no consensus for the use of nifedipine in patients

183

receiving RTV, PK profiles at different dose levels of nifedipine was simulated to

184

investigate the optimal dose during the co-administration with RTV.

185

After RTV was discontinued, 2 different dose regimens were investigated. One is

186

to use reduced-dose nifedipine, and the other is to restore to the original dose of

187

nifedipine. Taking IR tablets as an example, in the first regimen, nifedipine at a lower

188

dose (5 mg Q12H) or an extended dosing interval (10 mg Q24H) was taken for 5 more

189

days after the last dose of RTV, followed by a return to an original regimen (10 mg

190

Q12H). Moreover, lower dose of nifedipine (1.25 mg, 1/4 of the minimum specification

191

of IR nifedipine tablets) was investigated. Since chewing or crushing before swallowing

192

SR or CR tablets is not allowed, dose less than 30 mg or 60 mg was not assessed. In the

193

second regimen, the regular dose of nifedipine (10 mg Q12H) was taken immediately

194

after the last dose of RTV. The detailed dose adjustment scenarios are shown in Table

195

3. Due to the limitation of software, the dose amount of SR and CR tablets cannot be

196

adjusted directly and only the adjustment of the dosing interval was assessed.

197

Nifedipine PD model development and verification

198

Studies have demonstrated that it is more important to control systolic blood

199

pressure (SBP) than diastolic blood pressure (DBP)[37], and SBP is a better predictor

200

of cardiovascular risk than DBP in most of patients treated with antihypertensive

201

agents[38]. Therefore, only SBP was employed in the PBPK/PD modeling. A Emax

202

model developed by Shimada et al.[39] was linked to the PBPK to investigate the effect

203

of DDI on the SBP. The relationship between nifedipine concentration and the reduction

204

in SBP was expressed by ordinary Emax model (Eq. 2).

207

SBP, nifedipine concentration at 50% maximum effect and nifedipine concentration,

208

respectively.

209

The Emax and the EC50 were -35 mmHg and 35 nM for therapeutic dose in the

210

previous report, respectively[39]. However, in reported cases of nifedipine overdose,

211

the SBP of the patients would decrease about 50 mmHg [6, 40, 41]. Therefore, in this

212

study, the Emax value was increased to -50 mmHg to fit the maximal SBP decrease based

213

on the previous case reports of nifedipine overdose. In addition, based on the range of

214

EC50 values reported in the literature [39, 42] , PD model under different EC50 values

215

was examined to fit the observed SBP change caused by nifedipine at therapeutics doses

216

[43, 44]. Details of these clinical PD studies were summarized in Table 4. The accuracy

217

of prediction was measured by comparing the maximum reduction in SBP (Rmax) and

218

the area under the effect-time curve (AUE) between prediction and observation. The

219

acceptable criteria were within 2-fold error.

220

Nifedipine PBPK/PD model application

221

The developed PBPK/PD model was used to predict the changes in SBP caused by the

222

dynamic changes in nifedipine exposures with and without RTV. Two clinical scenarios

223

were simulated and all the model simulations were carried out using a virtual population

224

representative within Simcyp®.

225

The first scenario was designed to answer whether dose adjustment of nifedipine

226

can maintain SBP at normal range. Two dosing regimens were investigated after

227

patients taking combined nifedipine with RTV at steady state, (1) the nifedipine dose

228

was continued at regular regimen during co-administration with RTV; (2) the nifedipine

229

regimen was changed to extended dosing interval during the co-administration with

230

RTV.

231

The second scenario was designed to investigate how to adjust the dose regimen of

232

nifedipine after the withdrawal of RTV. For this scenario, two dosing regimens were

233

examined, (1) adjusted dosage regimen was continued for 5 more days after the last

234

dose of RTV; (2) the regular regimen was resumed immediately after RTV was stopped.

Results

236

Development of the nifedipine PBPK model

237

The model of IR nifedipine was developed first using the Simcyp® compound file. Next

238

was development of the SR and CR nifedipine model which used the same input data

239

as the IR model except for the absorption model and dissolution data. The IR nifedipine

240

used the first-order absorption model, while the SR and CR formulations used the

241

ADAM model.

242

Verification of the nifedipine PBPK model

243

Concentration−time plasma profiles from DDI studies were used to verify the PK model

244

of nifedipine. The PBPK model predictions of nifedipine plasma concentrations profiles

245

in three formulations (IR/SR/CR) were consistent with the clinically observed data and

246

met the model acceptance criteria. The detailed results are as follows:

247

IR formulation Using 6 published DDI studies[1, 2, 29-32], the predicted AUC

248

and Cmax ratios of nifedipine after single or multiple administrations in the presence and

249

absence of concomitant drugs were compared with the respective observations (Table

250

5; Figure 1-2). The results show that the predicted nifedipine AUC values in the

251

absence of concomitant drugs were consistent with observed data, and median fold-

252

error was 0.66 (range: 0.29-1.84). In the presence of concomitant drugs, the predicted

254

AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine value. Relatively good predictability of the Cmax ratios within 0.5-

255

Thus, the current nifedipine model demonstrated good performance for the purpose of

DDI investigation.

261

predicted AUC ratio was 1.45-fold of the observed AUC which indicated good

262

predictive performance.

263

CR formulation Figure 4 shows the observed and predicted values for CR

264

nifedipine PK profiles after a single oral dose administration in the healthy volunteers.

265

The predicted Cmax and AUC ratios were within 1.46-fold of the observed data.

266

Therefore, the PBPK model for CR formation showed a good descriptive and predictive

267

performance.

268

Nifedipine-RTV DDI

269

The final PBPK model was used to predict changes in CYP3A4 enzyme abundance and

270

nifedipine plasma PK profiles after the co-administration with RTV over time. As

271

shown in Figure 5, the CYP3A4 in the liver and intestinal were maximally deactivated

272

within three days after the co-administration of RTV (100 mg Q12H), which suggested

273

there was a strong DDI between nifedipine and RTV. Figure 6 shows the predicted PK

274

profiles of three formulations nifedipine over time following the dosing schedules listed

275

in Table 3. Both the Cmax and AUC increased significantly due to CYP3A4 inhibition

276

by RTV and reached steady state on approximately Day 10. The inhibitory effect of

277

RTV on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC24h

278

by 44.94-50.77 times (Table 6), which showed that the combination of RTV have a

279

significant impact on the exposure of nifedipine.

280

Moreover, the plasma concentration of three formulations of nifedipine decreased

281

to the baseline (without RTV) on the 4-5th day after the last dose of RTV.

When the EC50 was set to 98 nM, the PD model fitted best. The model-predicted SBP

284

compared with the observations for nifedipine at regular dose were presented in Figure

285

7. And the predicted PD profiles for three formulations nifedipine at regular doses

286

suggested that the model was successful in predicting the clinical data. The ratios of the

287

predicted and observed values of Rmax and AUE for IR, SR and CR nifedipine were

288

within 0.87-1.14 (Table 7). Thus, the current nifedipine PD model showed good

289

predictive performance.

290

Nifedipine-RTV PBPK/PD model application

291

For the three formulations of nifedipine, dose adjustment of nifedipine during RTV co-

292

administration was unable to maintain nifedipine plasma concentrations and SBP at the

293

same level as without RTV (Figure 8). Moreover, the established PBPK model showed

294

that reducing the daily dose of IR nifedipine from 20 to 1.25 mg did not significantly

295

alter the nifedipine–RTV DDI potential, suggesting that reduced-dose (1/16) nifedipine

296

(Figure S1) might not fully mitigate the risk of severe hypotension when combined

297

with standard-dose (100 mg) RTV. The influence of dose reduction on the SR and CR

298

formulations are the same as IR.

299

For scenario 1, Figure 9 shows the PD profiles of regular dose of nifedipine

300

combined with RTV. For an individual taking a regular nifedipine dose combined with

301

100 mg Q12H RTV, the predicted dynamic SBP decrease was up to 47 mmHg, which

302

might be a critically low blood pressure. Moreover, nifedipine at a reduced dose during

303

RTV co-administration was unable to maintain SBP in normal range (Figure 10).

304

Therefore, the combined use of nifedipine and RTV-containing regimens is not

305

recommended.

306

The simulations from scenarios 2 (Figure 10) showed continuing the reduced

307

nifedipine dose for an additional 5 days results in a lower nifedipine plasma

308

concentrations and a corresponding increase in SBP over the 5 days. This suggested

309

that the dose of nifedipine cannot be immediately restored to the regular dose after the

310

withdrawal of RTV in case of RTV co-administration.

311

Discussion

312

With the outbreak of viral infections such as COVD-19, MERS and SARS, the antiviral

313

effect of RTV-containing regimens has received increasing attention [16, 45].

314

Hypertensive patients are often potential susceptible population [46, 47] and require

315

antiviral treatment after viral infection. Thus, the combination of CCB and RTV is not

316

unavoidable. There have been previous studies [35, 48] on the DDI of RTV and

317

amlodipine, but there is a lack of systematic research on the commonly used CCB,

318

nifedipine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study to investigate

319

the DDI between nifedipine and RTV-containing regimens by using PBPK/PD analysis.

320

Previously published PBPK modeling of nifedipine mainly focused on the drug

321

formulations [23, 49] or special populations [50-52]. The nifedipine model developed

322

in this study is more comprehensive considering commonly used three formulations,

323

relationship of PK and PD and DDI. Moreover, the nifedipine PBPK model built in the

324

software of Simcyp® hasn’t been well verified for the purpose of DDI prediction. The

325

developed nifedipine model was herein verified with clinical DDI studies involving

326

CYP3A inhibitors/inducers or with PK profiles from the healthy volunteers. Although

327

the absolute values of the model-predicted Cmax and AUC did not match the observed

328

values perfectly, the exposure change caused by DDI were in good agreement with the

329

observed data (all the fold errors <1.83) (Table 4). This indicates the good performance

330

of nifedipine PBPK model as a victim drug in the DDI prediction.

331

Nifedipine undergoes significant first-pass metabolism by CYP3A in the both

332

intestine and liver[53], thus resulting in significantly enhanced in vivo exposure of the

333

drug when administered together with strong irreversible CYP3A4 inhibitor like RTV.

334

The inhibitory potency of RTV in vivo has been shown to be equivalent to or greater

335

than ketoconazole which is a strong index CYP3A inhibitor for DDI studies [54]. The

336

PBPK model described the interaction over time between nifedipine and RTV, and

337

showed that the combined use of RTV significantly reduced the CYP3A4 enzyme

338

content in the liver and intestine and the Cmax and AUC24h of nifedipine increased by

339

9.82-34.35 and 44.94-50.77 times, respectively. The Cmax of all three formulations

340

nifedipine exceeded 700 ng/ml, which is far beyond the therapeutic concentration range

341

of nifedipine (25-100 ng/mL)[6]. Therefore, the potential risk of severe hypotension

342

becomes very high after its combined use with RTV.

343

Moreover, the established PBPK/PD model showed that nifedipine dose reduced

344

to 1/16 of the regular dose during RTV co-administration couldn’t prevent the risk of

345

hypotension. Therefore, patients are not recommended to take any formulations of

346

nifedipine and RTV-containing regimens simultaneously. In addition, it takes 5 days of

347

wash-out after RTV withdrawal to allow the nifedipine concentration to drop down to

348

a safe level when patient taking nifedipine. These results are the important hints for

349

patients taking the nifedipine treatment.

350

The PBPK/PD analysis was once used to investigate dose adjustment

351

recommendations for amlodipine during and after co-administration of RTV by

352

Mukherjee, et al [35]. The analysis suggested that resuming a full dose of amlodipine

353

(5 mg QD) immediately or continuing with the reduced dose (2.5 mg QD) for 5 days

354

after the last dose of RTV could be appropriate. Based on the simulation of this study,

355

the effect of RTV on nifedipine PK is significantly stronger than that on amlodipine,

356

although nifedipine and amlodipine are both dihydropyridine CCBs. Compared with

357

nifedipine, amlodipine has a lower incidence of interactions due to less first-pass

358

metabolism[55]by CYP3A isoform in the intestine and liver.

359

This study systematically investigated the DDI between nifedipine and RTV-

360

containing regimens, and provided meaningful guidance for clinical use, especially

361

during the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial in

362

patients with COVID-19 showed that triple combinations of interferon beta-1b, LPV/r

363

and ribavirin was safe and superior to LPV/r alone in alleviating symptoms and

364

shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to

365

moderate COVID-19[17]. And it’s reported that among 5700 patients hospitalized with

366

COVID-19 in the New York City area, even up to 56.6% have comorbid hypertension

367

[56]. Thus, the scenario of combining RTV during nifedipine drug treatment would

368

probably be of great clinical relevance. Our study showed that it could lead to severer

369

hypotension for patients with COVID-19 to take nifedipine and RTV-containing

370

regimens simultaneously.

371

Due to the lack of pharmacodynamic studies of nifedipine overdose, PD model in

372

this study referred to the previously reported model and verified with clinical data at

373

therapeutic doses, which may not accurately predict blood pressure changes at

374

excessive dose. However, the exposure of nifedipine regardless of the formulation has

375

increased many times after the combined use of RTV, far beyond the normal range.

376

Therefore, the combined use of nifedipine and RTV-containing regimens is still not

377

recommended according to PK prediction results. If an antiviral regimen containing

378

RTV is required, other antihypertensive agents should be replaced.

379

Conclusions

380

RTV had a pronounced effect on the pharmacokinetics of nifedipine. Combinations of

381

nifedipine and RTV is not recommended according to the PBPK/PD analysis. Restart

382

of nifedipine 5 days after discontinuation of RTV can maintain plasma levels and blood

383

pressure at a relatively safe level.
