ABSTRACT
We evaluated the performance of the Abbott BinaxNOWTM Covid-19 rapid antigen test to detect
virus among persons, regardless of symptoms, at a public plaza site of ongoing community
transmission. Titration with cultured clinical SARS-CoV-2 yielded a human observable threshold
between 1.6x104-4.3x104 viral RNA copies (cycle threshold (Ct) of 30.3-28.8 in this assay).
Among 878 subjects tested, 3% (26/878) were positive by RT-PCR, of which 15/26 had a Ct<30,
indicating high viral load. 40% (6/15) of Ct<30 were asymptomatic. Using this Ct<30 threshold for
Binax-CoV2 evaluation, the sensitivity of the Binax-CoV2 was 93.3% (14/15), 95% CI: 68.199.8%, and the specificity was 99.9% (855/856), 95% CI: 99.4-99.9%.

INTRODUCTION
The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection has spread at an unprecedented pace [1]. Efficient
transmission of infection by the respiratory route, including by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
persons, has fueled ongoing surges of new cases. Countries that have succeeded in epidemic
control have done so through the use of non-pharmacologic measures to reduce transmission
(universal masking, social distancing) coupled with aggressive testing, tracing and isolation of
infected subjects and quarantine of their contacts [2,3].
To date, the cornerstone of testing has been quantitative RT-PCR examination of respiratory
secretions. Such testing has excellent sensitivity and specificity but is expensive and requires
sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel to complete [4]. In practice in the United
States, these features have often generated testing bottlenecks that can result in long delays in
the reporting of results, compromising their utility in epidemiologic investigation and high
frequency of testing approaches [5]. As a result, there is increasing interest in more rapid and
economical assays that circumvent these limitations [6]. However, methods that do not include
an amplification step are inherently less sensitive; thus, their proper deployment in populations
will therefore require a rigorous evaluation of their performance characteristics in the different
epidemiologic settings in which they may be used.
Lateral flow antigen detection diagnostics have long been deployed for a variety of infectious
diseases including malaria, RSV, influenza, and more. For the current pandemic, one of the most
available of these tests is the Abbott BinaxNOWTM COVID-19 Ag Card (hereafter referred to as
Binax-CoV2), which detects viral nucleocapsid (N) protein in direct nasal swabs. The test requires
no laboratory instrumentation; results are scored visually and returned within 15 minutes. In
August 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for this test in the diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients being tested within 7 days of symptom onset
[7]. The US Department of Health and Human Services is now distributing 150 million test kits to

the 50 states, including some directly to nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other highrisk settings; allocation of the remaining tests will be decided by state governments. Given the
value of a rapid assessment of infectiousness, there is anticipated use in a broad range of subjects
including those who are asymptomatic.
Here we present the first systematic examination of the performance characteristics of the BinaxCoV2 test in a community screening setting where testing was offered for symptomatic and
asymptomatic subjects. Additionally, we present data from controlled laboratory evaluations of
the Binax-CoV2 test and quantification of inter-lot variability.
METHODS
Study population and Specimen Collection
Over 3 days in September 2020, we offered testing in the Mission District, a Latinx-predominant
neighborhood, known from prior surveys to have an elevated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
[8,9]. Walk-up, free outdoor testing was conducted at a public plaza located at a point of
intersection between the Bay Area-wide subway system (BART) and the San Francisco city
bus/streetcar system (MUNI). On the day of test, participants self-reported symptoms and date of
onset, demographics, and contact information, as required by state and federal reporting
guidelines. On each participant, a laboratory technician performed sequential anterior swab (both
nares per swab) for the Binax-CoV2 assay followed by a second swab (both nares) for RT-PCR.
Participants were notified of RT-PCR test results via standard procedures; because of
uncertainties of testing performance in this population and setting, Binax-CoV2 results were not
reported back to study subjects.
Laboratory Testing for SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the CLIA-certified lab operated by UCSF
and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub as described [10,11]. Briefly, anterior nasal swabs collected in
DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research) were subjected to RT-PCR using probes specific to the viral
N and E genes, and to an internal human positive control (RNAse P). The assay has a detection
limit of 100 viral copies/mL, and a sample is designated as positive if either the N or E probes
yield cycle thresholds of less than 45.
Field Testing using Binax-CoV2 assay
Binax-CoV2 assay was performed by technicians on site as described by the manufacturer using
the supplied Puritan swabs. Each assay was read by two independent observers, and a third
observer served as a “tie-breaker”. Beginning on day 2 of the study, each Binax-CoV2 assay card
was scanned onsite using a color document scanner (CanoScan LIDE 400, Canon). For the
purpose of this paper, the sample bands were retrospectively quantified from image data. Briefly,
sample and background regions were localized by offset from the control band, and relative mean

pixel intensity decreases were calculated from blue and green channels averaged with respect to
background.
Titration of in vitro cultured SARS-CoV-2 on Binax-CoV2 cards
SARS-CoV-2 from a UCSF clinical specimen was isolated, propagated and plaqued on Huh7.5.1
cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [12]. Viral titers were determined using standard
plaque assays with Avicel RC-591 [13]. For viral titration experiments, SARS-CoV-2 with known
titer was diluted in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and 40 microliters of each
dilution was absorbed onto Puritan Sterile Foam Tipped Applicator swabs. After absorption,
antigen detection was completed using Binax-CoV2 per manufacturer instructions. Images of
Binax-CoV2 cards were taken on an Apple iPhone6. Each dilution was also assayed by RT-PCR
calibrated with internal cloned viral RNA standards. All experiments using cultured SARS-CoV-2
were conducted in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
N protein titration assay of Binax-CoV2 lots
SARS-CoV-2 N protein (1-419) was expressed in BL21(DE3) E.coli and purified by Ni-NTA
chromatography, incorporating a 1M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole wash to remove bound RNA, and
formulated in 50 mM Na2HPO4, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0 at 1.72 mg/mL. Purified
protein was diluted in 50 mM Na2HPO4, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.2. Six concentrations of N protein
were tested on ten lots of Binax-CoV2 kits: 9 lots obtained from the State of California and 1
original lot used in the community study and laboratory live virus work (126029). Briefly, 40ul of
purified N protein was absorbed onto the provided Puritan swab. Binax-CoV2 card tests were run
per manufacturer instructions by two technicians per lot for a total of four replicates per
concentration and imaged on document scanner. The Abbott-provided positive control swab from
each lot was run and passed quality control for all ten lots.
Ethics statement
The UCSF Committee on Human Research determined that the study met criteria for public health
surveillance. All participants provided informed consent for dual testing.
RESULTS
Binax-CoV2 performance using a titration of in vitro cultured SARS-CoV-2
To explore the relationship of RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), viral load, and the corresponding
visual Binax-CoV2 result, a dilution series of lab-cultured SARS-CoV-2 with known titers was
assayed both by RT-PCR and by Binax-CoV2 (Figure 1). For this stock of virus, the threshold for
detectability by human eye on the Binax-CoV2 assay was between 1.6-4.3x104 viral copies (100250 pfu), corresponding to a Ct (average of N and E genes) of 30.3 and 28.8, respectively in this
assay.

Community RT-PCR Testing Results
Of the 878 subjects tested, 54% were male, 77% were 18 to 50 years of age, 81% self-identified
as Latinx, and 84% reported no symptoms in the 14 days before testing. Twenty-six persons (3%)
were RT-PCR+; of these, 15/26 (58%) had a Ct<30 and 6/15 (40%) were asymptomatic. Among
asymptomatic individuals with Ct<30, 4/6 developed symptoms within 2 days after testing. Of the
11 persons RT-PCR-positive with Ct>30, 4 reported symptom onset > 7 days before testing, 1
reported symptom onset 3 days prior to testing, and the remainder reported no symptoms.
Comparison of RT-PCR and Binax-CoV2 testing results from Community Testing
Because the readout of the Binax-CoV2 assay is by visual inspection of the bands on the lateral
flow assay strip, there is an element of subjectivity in scoring the results, especially when bands
are faint or partial (i.e. do not extend across the entire width of the strip). The manufacturer’s
instructions suggest scoring any visible band (partial or full, faint or strong) as positive. Because
these criteria were elaborated from studies of symptomatic cases, we were uncertain of their
applicability to the screening of populations with asymptomatic subjects. Accordingly, we used
the manufacturer’s reading instructions and tested 217 samples, of which 214 yielded valid BinaxCoV2 results: 7 (3.3%) were RT-PCR (+); using the manufacturer’s proposed criteria, 5 of these
7 were Binax-CoV2 (+). However, of 207 RT-PCR (-) samples, 9 (4.3%) were Binax-CoV2 (+).
Thus, using the manufacturer’s proposed criteria, 9/14 Binax-CoV2 (+) tests (64%) in this
population were likely false positives (Ag(+)/RT-PCR(-)). Clearly, these initial criteria were
problematic in a screening setting like this one.
Therefore, on subsequent test days, we evaluated additional criteria for classifying a band as
positive, in consultation with experts from the manufacturer’s research staff. Classifying only
strong bands as positive eliminated false positives, but did not address the subjective thresholding
process, particularly for calling faint bands. Optimal performance occurred the when bands were
scored as positive if they extended across the full width of the strip, irrespective of the intensity of
the band. Using these criteria on 283 RT-PCR-negative samples, none scored positive for antigen
on the Binax-CoV2 test, thus markedly alleviating the false positive readings. With these updated
scoring criteria, 5/9 RT-PCR (+) samples were Binax-CoV2 (+) for antigen. The 4/9 RT-PCR (+)
samples that were Binax-CoV2 (-) had Ct>30. We find that scoring a test as positive if bands
extended across the full width of the strip, irrespective of band intensity, the least subjective and
easiest method to implement in the field and have developed a training tool:
https://unitedinhealth.org/binax-training. Accordingly, this method was used to score the data
collected in this study (Figure 2).
The Binax-CoV2 assay results of the 26 RT-PCR-positive individuals are stratified by the Ct value
of the RT-PCR test and shown in Figure 2. As might be expected, the rapid antigen detection test
performed well in samples with higher viral loads: 15 of 16 samples with Ct<32 were positive
(Figure 2a). By contrast, none of the 10 samples with Ct≥34 were positive by Binax-CoV2 antigen
detection. Retrospective image quantification of Binax-CoV2 sample bands correlates with RT-

PCR Ct values for those individuals (Figure 2b). In each case, the corresponding image is shown
in order to demonstrate the correspondence between RT-PCR and the visual result (Figure 2c).
Sensitivity and Specificity
RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection [4] and, in this assay, has a
limit of detection of 100 viral RNA copies per mL. Direct antigen assays, such as Binax-CoV2, are
unlikely to rival the sensitivity of RT-PCR. Thus, to quantify the performance on the Binax-CoV2
assay in the context of community based testing, we defined a threshold for high virus levels
corresponding to the range thought to be the most transmissible: a cycle threshold of 30, which
corresponds to a viral RNA copy number of approximately 1.9x104 in this assay [11]. Using this
Ct<30 case definition and 95% confidence interval (CI), the sensitivity of the Binax-CoV2 was
93.3%, CI: 68.1-99.8% (14/15), and the specificity was 99.9%, CI: 99.4-99.9% (855/856).
Adjusting the threshold to a more conservative cycle threshold value of 33 (2.6x103 viral RNA
copies), the sensitivity was 93.8%, CI: 69.8-99.8% (15/16) and the specificity was 100%, CI: 99.6100% (855/855).
Evaluation of Binax-CoV2 lot-to-lot variation
We quantified lot to lot variability in 10 different lots of Binax-CoV2 card tests using a dilution
series of N protein, the SARS-CoV-2 protein that is captured in the Binax-CoV2 assay
(Supplementary Figure 1). At protein concentrations 17.2ng/ml and greater, sample band was
detected in all lots, and thus would not affect the outcome of this binary assay (Supplementary
Figure 1A). The binary scoring of the Binax-CoV2 tests is likely to be affected by lot to lot
variability only at lower levels of viral protein concentration, near the inherent limit of detection of
the test.
DISCUSSION
These data provide the first quantitative analysis of the performance characteristics of a widely
disseminated rapid antigen detection kit when applied to a population-based cohort that included
asymptomatic subjects. These results indicate a clear relationship between relative viral load and
test positivity, and provide a practical, real-world criterion to assist calling results in this setting.
We found that small modifications to the training of Binax-CoV2 technicians reduced the presence
of false-positives, a legitimate concern for the roll-out of these tests. Importantly, directing
technicians to call positives only if the sample band extended edge-to-edge of the test strip
appeared to preserve sensitivity while also reducing false-positives results.
The currently approved EUA for the Binax-CoV2 assay specifies use only in symptomatic
individuals. One of the main drivers of the current pandemic is that a substantial percentage of
infected people do not report symptoms, despite having viral loads indistinguishable from
symptomatic individuals [8,14]. The results presented here suggest that the Binax-CoV2 test
should not be limited to symptomatic testing alone but should also incorporate asymptomatic

individuals. Limiting use of Binax-CoV2 to symptomatic individuals would have missed nearly half
of the SARS-CoV-2 infections with high viral loads.
Furthermore, the impact of effectively deployed tests on forward transmission is hampered by
long wait times, often days, for test results. We reported previously that in the community setting,
by the time a person is tested, counseled and situated under effective isolation conditions, the
effective isolation period is often nearly over [9]. This is particularly true for many communities of
color, where reported delays in accessing tests and results are even longer [5,15]. Rapid tests
could reduce these delays and maximize time of effective isolation. Limitations of our study
include its cross-sectional design and overall small number of RT-PCR positive cases. Additional
field performance of this assay is needed and will help inform optimal use strategies. We
recommend evaluating the Binax-CoV2 assay side by side with RT-PCR in each context it will be
used prior to use of Binax-CoV2 without the use of RT-PCR.
During the early stages of infection, viral load may be too low to detect by direct antigen assays,
such as Binax-CoV2. This inherent lower sensitivity may be offset by faster turn-around, the ability
to test more frequently, and overall lower cost, relative to traditional RT-PCR methods. That said,
for persons who present with a high index of suspicion of COVID-19 and a negative Binax-CoV2
result, the test should be complimented with RT-PCR or a repeat Binax-CoV2 test at a later time
to make sure case not missed.
In summary, under field conditions with supplementary technician training, the Binax-CoV2 assay
accurately detected SARS-CoV-2 infection with high viral loads in both asymptomatic and
symptomatic individuals. The Binax-CoV2 test could be a valuable asset in an arsenal of testing
tools for the mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 spread, as rapid identification of highly infectious
individuals is critical.
