Abstract

32

Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants pose a threat to human immunity induced by natural infection and

33

vaccination. We assessed the recognition of three variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) in

34

cohorts of COVID-19 patients ranging in disease severity (n = 69) and recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech

35

vaccine (n = 50). Spike binding and neutralization against all three VOC was substantially reduced in the

36

majority of samples, with the largest 4-7-fold reduction in neutralization being observed against B.1.351.

37

While hospitalized COVID-19 patients and vaccinees maintained sufficient neutralizing titers against all

38

three VOC, 39% of non-hospitalized patients did not neutralize B.1.351. Moreover, monoclonal neutralizing

39

antibodies (NAbs) show sharp reductions in their binding kinetics and neutralizing potential to B.1.351 and

40

P.1, but not to B.1.1.7. These data have implications for the degree to which pre-existing immunity can

41

protect against subsequent infection with VOC and informs policy makers of susceptibility to globally

42

circulating SARS-CoV-2 VOC.

Introduction

45

With over 140 million confirmed infections and over three million deaths as of April 2021, the coronavirus

46

disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shows few signs of abating (1). While severe acute respiratory

47

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, remained relatively stable

48

genetically and antigenically during the first stage of the pandemic, higher levels of genetic variation have

49

been observed during the second wave of the pandemic with considerable genetic changes compared to

50

the original Wuhan Hu-1 strain of SARS-CoV-2. These genetic changes include substitutions within the

51

functional domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein resulting in altered phenotypes of the virus. The

52

WHO has currently defined three VOC based on possible increase in transmissibility or change in COVID-

53

19 epidemiology, increase in virulence or change in clinical disease presentation, or decrease in

54

effectiveness of available diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics. These VOC include B.1.1.7

55

(20I/N501Y.V1, first detected in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (20H/N501Y.V2, first detected in South

56

Africa) and B.1.1.28.P1 (P.1, 20J/N501Y.V3, first detected in Brazil), which have since spread globally and

57

as of April 2021, cases with these variants have been reported in 132, 82 and 52 countries, respectively

58

(2–5). The emergence of these variants has raised concerns as to whether immunity, be it natural

59

immunity from prior infection or immunity from vaccination, can protect against these different variants.

60

Moreover, it is unclear whether therapeutic monoclonal NAbs isolated from convalescent donors retain

61

therapeutic efficacy against these new variants.

62

The S protein of coronaviruses is the main target of NAbs and consists of a membrane-proximal

63

S2 domain containing the fusion peptide and a membrane-distal S1 domain containing the receptor

64

binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain (NTD) (Fig. 1A). The S protein mediates viral entry

65

through interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells (6, 7).

66

Therefore, substitutions present in the RBD of these emerging VOC are particularly worrisome as they

67

might improve binding to the human receptor and thus increase viral fitness and transmissibility. Indeed,

68

B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 all share the N501Y RBD mutation, which contributes to an enhanced interaction

69

with the human ACE2 receptor resulting in increased infectivity and transmissibility (Fig. 1A) (8, 9). In

70

addition, both B.1.351 and P.1 contain the E484K substitution and a substitution at position 417 (K417N in

71

B.1.351 and K417T in P.1) both of which have been implicated in escape from NAbs by several studies

72

(Fig. 1A) (10, 11). More recently, E484K has also been observed in B.1.1.7 variants that have adopted this

73

mutation independently, leading to a more substantial loss of neutralizing titers in vaccinated individuals

74

than for B.1.1.7 alone (12). Additional substitutions mostly arise in the NTD region, located apically on the

75

S1 domain. Although the exact functional implication of substitutions within the NTD is not clear, it has

76

been shown that this domain is an important target for NAbs (13, 14). VOC B.1.351 and P.1 both carry five

77

mutations in this region of which they share one (L18F). Early reports on the B.1.351 lineage reported

78

variants with a substitution at position 242 and 246 (L242H and R246I), while other sublineages had a

79

three amino acid deletion (Δ242-244) (4). B.1.1.7 does not have substitutions in its NTD but has deletions

80

in this region (Δ69-70, Δ144) (Fig. 1A). Other mutations are identified in the S2 domain of the S protein

81

and their impact on antibody recognition and infectivity is not yet well understood, partly because the vast

82

majority of NAbs target the RBD or NTD. Finally, all these variants have the D614G mutation that defines

83

the B.1 lineage and became dominant throughout 2020, now being present in the large majority of

84

sequenced SARS-CoV-2 variants (> 99%) (Fig. 1A) (15).

85

All three VOC have been linked to increased infectivity and transmissibility, and the first reports

86

about specific substitutions in B.1.351 and P.1 associated with escape from immunity by infection or

87

mRNA vaccines have become available (10, 16–18). These first reports suggest that pre-existing immunity

88

was generally sufficient to neutralize B.1.1.7 to similar levels as WT in mRNA vaccine recipients and in

89

convalescent individuals up to nine months after infection (17, 19). In case of B.1.351, the impact is more

90

substantial with neutralizing titers from convalescent patients being reduced by ~6 to 13-fold while vaccine

91

recipients are reported to have a ~10 to 14-fold reduction (10, 17, 18). Moreover, it is reported that ~40%

92

of convalescent patients do not have any neutralizing activity against B.1.351 nine months after primary

93

infection (17). A recent study showed that although B.1.351 and P.1 have similar mutations in their RBD,

94

sera from convalescent patients as well as mRNA vaccine recipients showed a neutralization reduction of

95

~3-fold against P.1 while this was 7-13-fold for B.1.351 (20, 21).
Although these studies have provided valuable initial insights in altered antigenic properties of

96
97

these VOC, few studies have compared all three VOC side-by-side. Furthermore, comparing immune

98

responses from vaccine recipients and individuals who have suffered from mild or severe COVID-19 as

99

well as reactivity of NAbs to all three VOC within the same study will provide useful insights that can be

100

used for additional surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the use of monoclonal antibodies for treatment

101

and modifications of vaccines in order to increase immune coverage of immunity to include yet unknown

102

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

103
104

Results

105

Recognition of SARS-CoV-2 VOC by convalescent and vaccine sera is reduced

106

Here, we assessed the impact of VOC B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 on humoral immunity elicited either by

107

mRNA vaccination or by natural infection with SARS-CoV-2. To this end, we studied two cohorts of

108

individuals: the COSCA cohort that included convalescent COVID-19 patients (n = 69) and the S3 cohort

109

that included health care workers (HCW) who were vaccinated twice with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19

110

vaccine (n = 50) (Table 1). The COSCA cohort included hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients in the

111

Netherlands who were enrolled and sampled four to six weeks after symptom onset (i.e. close to the

112

expected peak of humoral immunity) between March 2020 and January 2021 (Table 1). Based on the

113

rarity of B.1.351 and P.1 in the Netherlands, no individuals are expected to have been infected with either

114

VOC. However, infections with B.1.1.7 became more prevalent towards the end of 2020, with the

115

estimated prevalence of B.1.1.7 reaching 24% in the Netherlands in the week of the last inclusion

116

(January 2021) (22). As genomic data was not collected as part of this study, we cannot exclude that a

117

few patients were infected with B.1.1.7. The S3 cohort consists of health care workers without prior SARS-

118

CoV-2 infection who received the approved Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine twice with a three

119

week interval and sampled four weeks after the second vaccination (Table 1).

120

We first assessed S protein binding titers of convalescent and vaccinee sera in a custom multiplex

121

protein microarray that has been extensively validated for clinical use (table S1) (23). We generated S

122

proteins, using previously described stabilization approaches, from all three VOC that had been identified

123

at the time of assessment as well as a control wild-type (WT) S protein from the Wuhan Hu-1 virus

124

(GenBank: MN908947.3) isolated in December 2019 (6, 24, 25). Overall, the antibody responses against

125

each S protein were heterogeneous and differed up to ~1200-fold between the strongest and weakest

126

responders. The recognition of the three VOC by convalescent patients was significantly reduced

127

compared to WT by an average of 2.4-fold, 3-fold and 4-fold for B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, respectively (p <

128

0.0001 for all, Fig. 1, B and C). Binding titers elicited by the mRNA vaccine were more homogeneous than

129

those elicited by natural infection and differed ~10-fold between responders, with all participants having

130

half-maximal binding titers (ED50s) exceeding 103, except for one poor responder (Fig. 1B). Since the

131

variability of binding titers in convalescent sera is considerable, we examined whether this variability was

132

related to severity of disease (i.e. hospital admission, Fig. 1D). We observed a highly significant ~8-fold

133

difference in ED50s between non-hospitalized patients and hospitalized patients, which is in line with

134

previous reports of WT SARS-CoV-2 binding titers correlating with severity of disease (p < 0.0001) (26,

135

27). This difference in binding titers between non-hospitalized patients and hospitalized patients was

136

consistent for all three SARS-CoV-2 VOC studied (Fig. 1D). When comparing immune responses of

137

vaccine recipients with convalescent sera, we observed similar S protein binding titers between vaccinee

138

and hospitalized patients, which are an average ~4 to 11-fold higher compared to non-hospitalized

139

patients for all VOC (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that vaccine recipients as well as

140

COVID-19 patients exhibit reduced binding to S proteins of the currently circulating VOC, with hospitalized

141

patients and vaccine recipients exhibiting higher binding titers overall compared to non-hospitalized

142

patients.

143
144

SARS-CoV-2 VOC are substantially less sensitive to serum NAbs

145

We next tested the neutralizing activity of convalescent and vaccinee sera (Fig. 2, table S1). To this end,

146

we generated lentiviral-based pseudoviruses of the currently widespread SARS-CoV-2 D614G (WT)

147

variant as well as B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1. We detected substantial neutralizing activity against the WT

148

virus (half maximal neutralization titer, ID50 > 100) in 96% of convalescent patients irrespective of

149

hospitalization, and in all vaccine recipients, except the one poor responder (Fig. 2A). Indeed, the overall

150

binding titers correlated well with the neutralization titers for all VOC (fig. S1C). Non-hospitalized patients

151

had the most heterogeneous responses, with WT neutralizing titers differing by up to ~150-fold, while titers

152

against WT were much more homogeneous in hospitalized patients (up to ~20-fold difference) and

153

vaccine recipients (up to ~12-fold difference) (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the binding results, we observed a

154

marked and significant reduction in serum ability to neutralize VOC pseudoviruses (Fig. 2A). For all three

155

groups, the difference was most apparent against the B.1.351 VOC, showing a reduction of ~4-, 7- and 5-

156

fold in neutralizing titers for non-hospitalized patients, hospitalized patients and vaccine recipients,

157

respectively (p < 0.0001, Fig. 2, A and B). The data were corroborated in an authentic SARS-CoV-2

158

neutralization assay (fig. S2, A-D). We did not observe an effect of medication, including the antiviral drug

159

remdesivir (rdv) and the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (dexa) on neutralization activity in sera

160

from convalescent but previously hospitalized patients (fig. S2E).

161

Some sera, most notably those from non-hospitalized patients, showed a complete loss of

162

neutralization against some VOC, whereas they did neutralize WT pseudovirus (Fig. 2A). When the sera

163

that reached the limit of detection against one of the VOC (i.e., ID 50 < 100) were excluded, the fold

164

difference observed between WT and VOC neutralization remained very similar across the three groups

165

(fig. S2F). 39% (16/41) non-hospitalized patients in this study lost all neutralizing activity against B.1.351

166

and 34% (14/41) were unable to neutralize P.1 while they did neutralize WT pseudovirus and B.1.1.7 (Fig.

167

2C). In contrast, all hospitalized patients (28/28) retained at least some neutralizing activity against

168

B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 and only 1/50 vaccine recipients completely lost neutralizing activity against

169

B.1.351, suggesting that high titers of NAbs against WT are predictive for cross-neutralization of VOC (Fig.

170

2C). Neutralizing titers of vaccine recipients against B.1.1.7 were an average ~3.6-fold lower than those of

171

hospitalized patients (p = 0.0015), while this was less substantial and not significant for B.1.351 (~2.2-fold)

172

and P.1 (~2.4-fold, Fig. 2D). Although B.1.351 showed the largest reduction in serum neutralization titers,

173

the largest reduction in binding for both convalescent patients and vaccinee was seen against P.1 (Fig. 1C

174

and Fig. 2B). Overall, we conclude that high neutralization levels against WT virus are predictive for the

175

ability to neutralize VOC, while low neutralization levels against WT often translate to the inability to

176

neutralize VOC B.1.351 and P.1.

177

Although hospitalized patients did not show a significant reduction in B.1.1.7 neutralization, both

178

vaccine recipients and non-hospitalized patients showed a small but statistically significant 1.6-fold

179

reduction for B.1.1.7 compared to WT (p = 0.0035, Fig. 2, A and B). The sole RBD mutation in B.1.1.7,

180

N501Y, might contribute to this effect although it has only been sporadically implicated in NAb escape

181

(28). Alternatively, the two NTD deletions in B.1.1.7 (Δ69-70, Δ144, Fig. 1A) that are not present in WT,

182

B.1.351 or P.1 might play a role. Moreover, while P.1 carries amino acid substitutions in the RBD at the

183

exact same positions as B.1.351, the reduction in P.1 neutralization compared to WT was significantly less

184

than for B.1.351 (p < 0.001, Fig. 2, A and B), which might be explained by differences in the NTD.

185
186

Neutralizing monoclonal NAbs lose potency against VOC

187

To obtain more insight into the antibody specificities that were affected by the mutations in the VOC we

188

assessed a panel of NAbs with known specificities isolated from convalescent patients, some of which

189

have since been characterized structurally, and some of which have been evaluated in preclinical

190

protection models (25, 29, 30). Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) experiments showed that for the majority of

191

RBD-targeting NAbs that span the four known epitope clusters on the RBD (31) the binding to B.1.351 and

192

P.1 S protein was reduced substantially, while binding to the B.1.1.7 S protein was mostly similar to WT

193

binding. This is consistent with observations that the only RBD mutation in B.1.1.7, i.e. N501Y, has not

194

been associated with escape from antibodies and was probably selected for increased ACE2 binding (8,

195

9), while E484K and K417N/T have a larger impact in neutralization by NAbs. RBD-targeting NAb COVA1-

196

18, which neutralized WT with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the ng/mL range and

197

protected from WT infections in three preclinical animal models (25, 30), displayed dramatically reduced

198

binding to B.1.351 and P.1 S proteins (Fig. 3A). Similarly, COVA2-15, which is highly potent against WT,

199

showed decreased binding kinetics to S proteins from B.1.351 and P.1 compared to WT and B.1.1.7 S

200

proteins (Fig. 3A). We also tested binding of RBD-targeting, SARS-CoV cross-NAbs COVA1-16 and

201

COVA2-02, which showed highly similar binding to all VOC S proteins tested, indicating that these NAbs in

202

particular target a conserved epitope that has not been influenced by the mutations present in these three

203

VOC. This is in line with previous findings of COVA1-16 able to recognize RBDs of pangolin and bat

204

origin, indicating that COVA1-16 recognizes an epitope that is highly conserved among sarbecoviruses

205

(29). For the NTD-targeting NAbs COVA1-22 and COVA 2-17, we found a substantial reduction of binding

206

to B.1.351 and P.1. COVA1-22 also showed reduced binding to B.1.1.7 S protein, while COVA2-17

207

retained binding to B.1.1.7. These results show that the binding of RBD NAbs as well as NTD NAbs are

208

impacted by mutations in VOC, while there are some RBD NAbs that retain similar binding kinetics to all

209

VOC.

210

Next, we attempted to pinpoint which mutations have the most impact on binding of RBD NAbs.

211

Therefore, we expressed soluble RBDs of VOC B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 as well as a RBD with only the

212

E484K mutation and performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with our panel of RBD

213

NAbs (fig. S3, A and B). Similar to our BLI data (Fig. 3A), most RBD antibodies show a large and similar

214

reduction in binding to B.1.351 and P.1 RBDs. However, COVA2-15 shows a ~4-fold lower half-maximal

215

binding titer (EC50) to P.1 compared to B.1.351, indicating that the K417N mutation impacts binding of this

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.21257441; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

216

particular highly potent antibody more than K417T (25) (fig. S3, A and B). A similar observation can be

217

made for COVA2-07, which does retain some binding against P.1 RBD but not against B.1.351 RBD (fig.

218

S3, A and B). Interestingly, while E484K alone knocks out binding in COVA1-12, COVA1-18, COVA2-29

219

and COVA2-39, this is not the case for the other RBD NAbs that are not impacted by E484K unless it is

220

accompanied by N501Y and a substitution at position 417 (fig. S3, A and B). For SARS-CoV cross-NAbs

221

COVA1-16, COVA2-02 and CR3022, none of the substitutions found in the VOC studied here had any

222

effect on binding. Thus, we show that while E484K alone has a substantial effect on the binding of some

223

NAbs, it is the combination of E484K with other mutations such as K417N/T that have the greatest impact

224

on the binding of RBD NAbs.

225

Finally, we sought to confirm these findings in pseudovirus neutralization assays (Fig. 3B, fig. S4).

226

In line with previous results (25), COVA1-18 and COVA2-15 exhibit picomolar IC50 titers against WT and

227

B.1.1.7 while neutralization against B.1.351 was completely knocked out for COVA1-18 and reduced by

228

~100-fold for COVA2-15 (Fig. 3B, fig. S4). Of note, only 5/11 tested RBD NAbs retained any neutralization

229

against B.1.351 and P.1, consistent with their abilities to bind the S proteins of these VOC or not. Both

230

NTD NAbs lost all neutralization potency against B.1.351, while COVA2-17 retained neutralizing activity

231

against P.1 (Fig. 3B). The 5-fold decrease in neutralization potency for COVA2-17 against B.1.1.7 is

232

consistent with earlier findings (32). Strikingly, SARS-CoV cross-NAb COVA1-16 did not lose potency

233

against any VOC, in line with previous results (10). The preservation of COVA1-16 potency (0.02 - 0.16

234

235

remaining virtually unchanged throughout sarbecovirus evolution and after >1 year of global SARS-CoV-2

236

evolution (29), thereby underlining the importance of having such NAbs readily available as therapeutics

237

against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOC.

Discussion

240

In this study, we show that COVID-19 convalescent patients as well as mRNA vaccine recipients sampled

241

at the expected peak of their immunity, showed a marked decrease in binding and neutralization potency

242

against two of three VOC currently circulating (Fig. 2, A and B). While patients who experienced mild

243

infection have lower binding and neutralization titers against the original virus and often no activity against

244

B.1.351 and P.1, all hospitalized convalescent patients and all but one vaccine recipient maintain

245

neutralizing titers against the three VOC (Fig. 2C). Although the observed cross-reactivity is considerable,

246

the substantial reduction in binding and neutralization titers against VOC B.1.351 and P.1 could possibly

247

leave them more vulnerable to a (re-)infection with these VOC. Indeed, first reports of breakthrough

248

infection in vaccine recipients are starting to emerge (33).

249

To date, most studies have focused on a specific VOC or on a specific set of samples (i.e. vaccine

250

recipients, convalescent patients or NAbs) (4, 10, 16, 20). Here, through systematic comparison of non-

251

hospitalized patients, hospitalized patients and vaccine recipients in the context of multiple VOC, we are

252

able to assess the impact of specific sets of mutations. We observed that serum binding titers were

253

impacted most by the P.1 VOC, while for neutralizing titers against B.1.351 showed the largest reduction

254

in all three groups studied (Fig. 1C and 2B). This irregularity might be explained by non-neutralizing Abs

255

targeting the S2 domain or NTD being more affected by the amino acid substitutions in P.1 compared to

256

B.1.351. The most striking differences between B.1.1.7 and the other two VOC are the high number of

257

mutations in the S2 domain and the lack of RBD mutations in B.1.1.7 that would result in a reduction in

258

potency of RBD-targeting NAbs. Moreover, B.1.351 and P.1 show different neutralization signatures, most

259

notably in hospitalized patients and vaccine recipients that have higher neutralization titers in general (Fig.

260

2B). While we and others have shown the E484K mutation impacts binding and neutralization by serum

261

and RBD NAbs greatly (fig. S3B) (34), the discrepancy in neutralizing titers between B.1.351 and P.1 in

262

vaccinees specifically might be because of the difference in amino acid substitution at position 417, as

263

indicated by the NAb binding to the RBD variants. Alternatively, this discrepancy in neutralizing titers,

264

despite similarity in their RBD, could be indicative of the NTD substitutions in B.1.351 causing a greater

265

decrease in neutralizing titers than those found in P.1, which is reflected by NTD-targeting NAb COVA2-

266

17. These results provide additional guidance for the risk evaluation of newly emerging variants during

267

routine surveillance.

268

An implication of this study could be that (re-)infections with new VOC will become more

269

prevalent, especially later on when antibody titers have declined. However, the question remains whether

270

infection with an emerging, antigenically-altered variant will result in a less severe course of infection.

271

While circulating neutralizing antibodies are expected to play a dominant role in preventing infection,

272

memory B cells might prevent severe disease, as they quickly gear up to generate new neutralizing

273

antibodies. Our finding that NAbs that have lost their neutralization capacity against VOC can often still

274

bind to VOC S proteins, suggests that memory B cells of this specificity would still be able to recognize

275

incoming VOC, and affinity-mature to regain neutralization capacity, resulting in faster virus clearance than

276

during de novo immune responses. Indeed, the first results of the Ad26.CoV2.S phase 3 clinical trial

277

indicate that the vaccine, coding for the WT S protein, does result in a milder disease course after infection

278

with the B.1.351 VOC(35). It remains to be seen if this effect persists when antibody levels decline over

279

time.

280

Some real-world consequences from the observations we made here can be gleaned from phase

281

3 efficacy studies with vaccines based on the Wuhan Hu-1 strain and performed in geographic areas

282

where VOC dominated during the trial. First, the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S vaccine, which was tested in

283

the United Kingdom when WT and B.1.1.7 were co-circulating, was subtly less effective against B.1.1.7

284

compared to the original virus (~70% versus ~81%) (36, 37), while it was virtually ineffective in South

285

Africa where B.1.351 was dominant during the trial (38). The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was tested in

286

many countries including the United States and South Africa. The vaccine was 74% effective at preventing

287

moderate-to-severe disease in the United States, where 97% of sequenced viruses were of the reference

288

Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G strain, whereas in South Africa 95% of sequenced viruses were B.1.351 and vaccine

289

efficacy fell to 52% (35). Similar trends were reported for the Novavax subunit vaccine in a press release.

290

Our results and those of others (35, 36, 38) strongly suggest that booster vaccines with

291

antigenically diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants are needed to induce longer-lasting and more cross-reactive

292

immunity. Indeed, multiple vaccine manufacturers have announced that they are already working on

293

implementing VOC into their immunization regimen, with Moderna having started the evaluation of a

294

booster vaccine candidate based on B.1.351 in a phase 1 clinical trial (39). Considering the timelines for

295

modification of mRNA versus other vaccine platforms, the mRNA vaccines might offer advantages against

296

the evolving virus.

297

We observed that NAb COVA1-16 retained activity against B.1.351 and P.1, both of which have

298

the E484K mutation that has now also been observed in the B.1.1.7 lineage and multiple other lineages (9,

299

12). The intrinsic capacity of COVA1-16 to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV and its highly conserved epitope

300

that remained unchanged throughout sarbecovirus evolution holds promise when considering SARS-CoV-

301

2 evolution now and in the future. Moreover, COVA1-16 synergizes with another cross-reactive NAb

302

CV38-142 to enhance neutralization of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (40). Together with the reduced

303

effectiveness of several emergency-use authorized NAbs and NAb cocktails against B.1.351, our results

304

re-emphasize the importance of not only having potent, but also cross-reactive NAbs available as a

305

therapeutic tool(10). Therefore, particularly when the potency of COVA1-16 can be improved, it could be

306

an attractive component of a pan-sarbecovirus NAb cocktail to prevent and treat infection with emerging

307

SARS-CoV-2 variants and to have on the shelf for future sarbecovirus pandemics.

308

While our study aims to provide an overview of many different aspects of pre-existing immunity

309

against VOC, there are some limitations. In this study, we present a vaccinee population that consists of

310

primary health care workers that are generally of middle age, with only four (8%) participants being older

311

than 60 (Table 1). However, we found no correlation between age and titers in convalescent patients

312

against any of the VOC tested. Moreover, we have focused on the neutralization potential of immune sera

313

and did not examine antibody effector functions which have been implicated previously in the control of

314

SARS-CoV-2 infection (41). Similar to other studies, our convalescent and vaccinee sera samples were

315

collected four to six weeks after infection and four weeks after vaccination (i.e. at the peak of immunity),

316

respectively. While we present findings that may have implications for additional booster vaccines and the

317

monitoring of VOC, we did not examine the aspect of waning antibody titers and how those might

318

influence VOC binding and neutralization. Finally, we have merely examined an early line of defense

319

against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. serum antibody levels), while we expect memory B cells to play an

320

important part in re-infections with SARS-CoV-2 VOC. Indeed, swift re-activation of memory compartments

321

may lead to reduced transmissibility, a milder course of disease and a more potent immune response.

322

In conclusion, we observed a substantial reduction in binding and neutralization potency against

323

all three VOC in the majority of samples, with the individuals with lowest binding and neutralization titers

324

losing potency altogether, especially to B.1.351 and P.1. These data have implications for the degree to

325

which pre-existing immunity can protect against subsequent infection with VOC, the possible need of

326

vaccine modifications in order to increase immune coverage and the use of monoclonal antibodies of

327

therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. An important outstanding question is what else the virus has in store

328

for us and whether VOC, when not brought under control, will evolve further and continue to escape from

329

humoral immunity induced by infection or vaccination.

Materials & methods

331

Study design

332

The sera of 69 SARS-CoV-2 infected adults were collected four to six weeks after symptom onset through

333

the cross-sectional COVID-19 Specific Antibodies (COSCA) cohort (NL 73281.018.20) as described

334

previously (25). All participants had at least one nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab positive for

335

SARS-CoV-2 as determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR,

336

Roche LightCycler480, targeting the Envelope-gene 113bp). Participants were included from the start of

337

the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands in March 2020 until the end of January 2021. To investigate

338

the humoral response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine we used sera collected four

339

weeks after the second dose of 50 health care workers who were included at the beginning of the

340

pandemic in March 2020 in a prospective serologic surveillance cohort in two tertiary medical centers in

341

the Netherlands (S3 cohort; NL 73478.029.20). Participants of the surveillance cohort were tested routinely

342

for seroconversion by using a WANTAI (WS-1096) SARS-CoV-2 RBD total immunoglobulin serum

343

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and underwent additional PCR testing when experiencing

344

COVID-19 related symptoms. Participants were excluded when any of the above tests were indicative of a

345

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both studies were conducted at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers in the

346

Netherlands and approved by the local ethical committee. All individuals included in this study gave written

347

informed consent before participating.

Protein design

350

The S constructs contained the following mutations compared to the WT variant (Wuhan Hu-1; GenBank:

351

MN908947.3): deletion (Δ) of H69, V70 and Y144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A and

352

D1118H in B.1.1.7; L18F, D80A, D215G, L242H, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G and A701V in

353

B.1.351; L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K, N501Y, D614G, H655Y and T1027I in P.1.

354

They were ordered as gBlock gene fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned PstI/NotI in a

355

pPPI4 expression vector containing a hexahistidine (his) tag with Gibson Assembly (ThermoFisher). All S

356

constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing and subsequently produced in HEK293F cells

357

(ThermoFisher) and purified as previously described (25). The RBD constructs contained the following

358

mutations: N501Y in B.1.1.7; K417N, E484K and N501Y in B.1.351; K417T, E484K and N501Y in P.1;

359

E484K as a single mutant. They were made by introducing the mutations into the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (331-

360

528 amino acids)-StrepII construct, kindly provided by Dr. Premkumar Lakshamanane (42), using a

QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). All RBD constructs were produced in

362

ExpiCHO cells and purified as previously described (43).

363
364

Multiplex protein microarray

365

HCoV-PMA slides were produced as described previously (23). WT and VOC (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) S

366

proteins were spotted in duplicate in three drops of 333 pL each on 24-pads nitrocellulose-coated slides

367

(ONCYTE AVID, GraceBio Labs, Bend, USA) by using a non-contact Marathon Arrayjet microarray spotter

368

(Roslin, UK). Printed micro-array slides were pre-treated with Blotto blocking buffer (ThermoFisher) to

369

avoid non-specific binding. Sera were tested in four 4-fold dilutions starting at 1:20, diluted in Blotto buffer

370

containing 0.1% Surfact-Amps20 (ThermoFisher) as previously described (23). Subsequently, slides were

371

incubated with goat anti-human IgG, F(ab’)2 fragment specific, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated (Jackson

372

Immunoresearch, West Grove, USA), diluted 1:1000 in Blotto buffer with 0.1% Surfact-Amps20 as

373

described. Incubation steps were followed by a washing step with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)

374

with 0.1% Tween. After the last wash, slides were washed with sterile water and dried. Day-to-day

375

variations were monitored by including a SARS-CoV-2 positive control serum in each test round. An in-

376

house SARS-CoV-2 standard was included in each test batch to correct for test-to-test variation. If the titer

377

of the positive control deviated more than 2-fold from the expected titer, the test batch was rejected and

378

repeated.

379
380

Pseudovirus design

381

The B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 pseudovirus constructs contained the same mutations as the S constructs.

382

They were ordered as gBlock gene fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned SacI/ApaI in the

383

pCR3 SARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 expression plasmid (GenBank: MT449663.1) (44) using Gibson Assembly

384

(ThermoFisher). The D614G pseudovirus construct was made using QuickChange Site-Directed

385

Mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). All constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing. Pseudovirus was

386

produced by co-transfecting the pCR3 SARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 expression plasmid with the pHIV-1NL43 ΔEnv-

387

NanoLuc reporter virus plasmid in HEK293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) (44, 45). Cell supernatant

388

containing the pseudovirus was harvested 48 h post transfection and stored at -80°C until further use.

cells/well in a 96-well plate coated with 50 μg/mL poly-L-lysine 1 day prior to the start of the neutralization

393

assay. NAbs (1-50 μg/mL) or heat-inactivated sera samples (1:100 dilution) were serial diluted in 5-fold

394

resp. 3-fold steps in cell culture medium (DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100

395

U/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and GlutaMax (Gibco)), mixed in a 1:1 ratio with pseudovirus and

396

incubated for 1 h at 37°C. These mixtures were then added to the cells in a 1:1 ratio and incubated for 48

397

h at 37°C, followed by a PBS wash and lysis buffer added. The luciferase activity in cell lysates was

398

measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and GloMax system (Turner

399

BioSystems). Relative luminescence units (RLU) were normalized to the positive control wells where cells

400

were infected with pseudovirus in the absence of NAbs or sera. The inhibitory concentration (IC 50) and

401

neutralization titers (ID50) were determined as the NAb concentration and serum dilution at which infectivity

402

was inhibited by 50%, respectively using a non-linear regression curve fit (GraphPad Prism software

403

version 8.3) (45).

404
405

Authentic virus neutralization assay

406

SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays were performed as described previously (46, 47). Duplicates of 2-

407

fold serial dilutions (starting at 1:10) of heat-inactivated sera (30 m, 56°C) were incubated with 100 median

411

cells were added in a concentration of 20,000 cells/well and incubated for 72 h at 35°C. The serum virus

412

neutralization titer (VNT50) was defined as the reciprocal value of the sample dilution that showed a 50%

413

protection of virus growth. Samples with titers ≥ 20 were defined as SARS-CoV-2 seropositive.

414
415

Monoclonal antibodies

416

The NAbs used in this study were isolated from participants in the “COVID-19 Specific Antibodies”

417

(COSCA) study as described before. NAbs were produced in HEK293F (ThermoFisher) cells as previously

418

described (25).

Bio-layer interferometry (BLI)

421

BLI experiments were performed on an Octet K2 (ForteBio). Ni-NTA biosensors (ForteBio) were loaded

423

buffer (PBS, 0.02% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA) for 300 s. After the biosensors were washed in a well

424

containing running buffer to remove excess protein, the biosensors were dipped in a well containing 30

425

µg/mL NAb in running buffer for 120 s to measure association. Next, the biosensors were moved to a well

426

containing running buffer for 120 s to measure dissociation of the S protein-NAb complexes.

427
428

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

429

Purified RBD-StrepII proteins (200 ng/well) were coated overnight onto Nunc MaxiSorp 96-well plates

430

(Thermo Fisher) at 4ºC. The plates were washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 before blocking

431

with 5% milk/PBS for 1 h at RT. After washing as described above, COVA NAbs, serially diluted in 2%

432

milk/PBS, were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. Bound NAbs were detected using horseradish

433

peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:3000) in 2% milk/PBS for 1 h at RT. After washing,

434

the color reaction was developed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Thermo Scientific).

435

The reaction was stopped by adding 0.3 N sulfuric acid and OD 450 was read using an Enspire instrument

436

(Perkin Elmer).

Visualization and statistical analysis

439

Data visualization and statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism software (version 8.3). The

440

non-parametric Friedman test was performed to assess statistical differences for paired samples, while the

441

non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for unpaired samples. Significance is denoted as ****, p

Figure 1. Binding of convalescent and vaccinee sera to VOC B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 spike
proteins. (A) Structural representation of spike (S) protein with its three domains (N-terminal domain,
NTD, in magenta; receptor-binding domain (RBD), in blue; S2 domain in green). Mutations in each of the
VOC S proteins are listed as well as their location in the trimer. Colors correspond to the S protein
domains in which the mutation occurs in. (B) Half-maximal binding (ED50) titers of polyclonal convalescent
sera (left, n = 57) and vaccinee sera (right, n = 50) to S protein of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 VOC.
Connected dots indicate results from the same individual. The lower cutoff for binding was set at an ED50
of 10 (grey shading). (C) Mean ± SEM fold reductions in ED50 titers for convalescent patients and vaccine
recipients against S proteins of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 VOC in comparison to ED 50 titers to the WT S
protein. (D) ED50 titers of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, hospitalized COVID-19 patients and
vaccine recipients against WT S protein and each of the VOC S protein. ****, p < 0.0001; ***, p < 0.001;
ns, not significant. All data points shown here represent the mean of a technical triplicate.

Figure 2. Neutralization of VOC B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 by convalescent and vaccinee sera.
(A) Half-maximal neutralization (ID50) titers of polyclonal sera from non-hospitalized convalescent patients
(n = 41), hospitalized convalescent patients (n = 28) and vaccine recipients (n = 50) against pseudoviruses
of WT and B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 VOC. Connected dots indicate results from the same individual. The
lower cutoff for neutralization was set at an ID50 of 100 (grey shading). (B) Mean ± SEM fold reductions in
ID50 titers for non-hospitalized convalescent patients, hospitalized convalescent patients and vaccine
recipients against B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 VOC pseudoviruses in comparison to ID 50 titers against the
WT pseudovirus. (C) Percentage of individuals in each of the three groups in (B) that have no detectable
serum neutralizing activity (ID50 < 100) against the indicated pseudoviruses. (D) ID50 titers of nonhospitalized patients, hospitalized patients and vaccine recipients against WT pseudovirus and each of the
VOC pseudoviruses. ****, p < 0.0001; ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05; ns, not significant. All data
points shown here represent the mean of a technical triplicate and are representative of at least two
independent experiments.

Figure 3. Binding kinetics and neutralization of NAbs isolated from convalescent COVID-19
patients. (A) Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) sensorgrams of 15 NAbs binding profile to WT spike as well as
to each of the VOC S proteins (WT, grey; B.1.1.7, orange; B.1.351, purple; P.1, green). The dotted line
indicates the end of NAb association and the start of dissociation. (B) Half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) values of 15 NAbs to each of the pseudoviruses used in Figure 2., separated by their
target epitope on S protein. COVA1-18, COVA2-15, COVA2-17 and COVA1-16 are highlighted because of
their neutralization characteristics. The grey shading indicates the maximum NAb concentration tested (50
µg/mL). Connected dots indicate IC50 values from the same NAb. Each dot represents the mean ± SD of a
technical triplicate. The curves shown are representative of at least two independent experiments.
