Abstract
The world is entering a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic in which there is an increasing call for reliable
antibody testing. To support decision making on the deployment of serology for either population
screening or diagnostics, we present a comprehensive comparison of serological COVID-19 assays. We
show that the assay detecting total immunoglobulins against the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV2, had optimal characteristics for antibody detection in different stages of disease.
Introduction
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has emerged in China in
late 2019 causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The rapid global spread and exponential growth of the
first pandemic wave in China, Europe and the US have stretched the limits of the available healthcare and
ICU capacity, reaching critical levels in the province where the outbreak originated, and elsewhere. Since
the initial notification of an outbreak on December 31st, the global response has transitioned from the
initial policy of active case finding and containment to an increasingly complex package of confinement
measures including closures of schools, restaurants, shops, implementation of travel restrictions, and
physical distancing measures. At present, given the global circulation of SARS-CoV-2, the consensus is that
elimination of the virus is no longer feasible, and that longer-term strategies are needed that strike a
balance between the economically and socially damaging (near) lockdown approaches and full release of
any control measures. There is wide agreement that, in the latter situation, rapid resurgence would be
very likely, with modelled epidemic peaks potentially exceeding the current healthcare capacity 1.
The "exit" strategy is defined as the transition from the current approach, which focuses entirely on
flattening the peak of the COVID-19 emergence curve, to the transition phase in which restrictions are
gradually lifted. The gradual lifting of control measures will require active surveillance to allow early
detection of new cases or clusters, coupled with contact tracing and quarantine, most likely combined
with continued physical distancing recommendations and enhanced protection of those at risk from most
severe disease. A key knowledge gap is the level and duration of immunity in the population at large and
in specific groups, including persons with different clinical severity 1. To assess the extent of virus
circulation in the community, and the likelihood of protection against a re-infection, there is a crucial
need to add serology to the testing algorithms. The required performance of a serological assay will
depend on the specific aim of testing which may be either population screening (in the general population

or at-risk populations) or diagnostic support. When selecting an appropriate assay for a specific purpose,
decision making should include the available knowledge on antibody specificities, kinetics, and functions.
We recently showed that antibodies directed against the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
specifically to the receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit strongly correlate with virus
neutralization 2. The likelihood of predicting protective antibody responses will thus increase when using
either S1 antigens or RBD in the assay. Here, we present a comprehensive comparison of a selection of
COVID-19 assays for antibody measurements to support decisions on deployment of serology for
population testing and diagnostics. The list of commercial assays offered is growing exponentially (FINDDX
inventory, currently 254 immunoassays are listed). We chose to include commercial assays that 1)
preferably target the spike of SARS-CoV-2 2) had received at least European Conformity (CE) marking or
other authorization, and 3) ensured sufficient production capacity.
Methods
Blood Samples
We used a well-defined specificity panel of 147 serum and plasma samples from persons exposed to a
human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, NL63 or OC43), SARS, MERS, or with a range of other respiratory
viruses (Table 1) to determine specificity of the assays. Specimen from patients with recent CMV, EBV or
M. pneumoniae infection were included as these have a high likelihood of causing cross reactivity. To
determine the sensitivity, 93 sera from 24 confirmed COVID-19 patients with different levels of disease
severity were analyzed. All specimen were stored at -20°C until use.
Ethical clearance
The use of specimen from the Netherlands was approved by the local medical ethical committee (MEC
approval: 2014–414). Serum samples from SARS patients were kindly provided by professor Malik Peiris,
Hong Kong University.
ELISA
ELISAs were selected based on predefined selection criteria like the coating antigen, authorizations for
use by various national regulatory agencies, availability of large scale production and available validation
data : 1) Wantai SARS-CoV-2 total Ig and IgM ELISA from Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise
Co., Ltd and 2) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISA assay (EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG.
ELISAs were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol.

DiaSorin Liaison XL
The Liaison XL is a semi-automated system using chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) technology for
detection of Ab in human samples. The assays were performedfollowing manufacturer’s protocol.
Rapid antibody test
The rapid tests we evaluated are 1) Rapid SARS -CoV-2 Antibody (IgM/IgG) Test from InTec utilizing the
nucleocapsid protein as antigen (Test of lot S2020021505), 2) the qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Cassette Rapid
Test (GICA) from Cellex Inc. utilizing both the spike and the nucleocapsid protein (Test lot
0200311WI5513C-3) and 3) the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (Whole Blood/Serum/Plasma)
from Orient Gene / Healgen (Test lot 2003260), utilizing both the spike and the nucleocapsid protein. All
three tests are based on immunochromatography for detection of IgG and IgM specific to SARS CoV-2 in
human whole blood (venous and fingerstick) serum or plasma. We performed the tests following the
manufacturers’ instructions. Each sample was tested by one test and readout (positive/negative)
interpreted by two operators in parallel.
PRNT 50
PRNT50 was used as a reference for this study, because neutralization assays are the standard for CoV
serology. We tested serum and plasma samples for their neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2
(German isolate; GISAID ID EPI_ISL 406862; European Virus Archive Global # 026V-03883) by plaquereduction neutralization test (PRNT50) as previously described (Okba et al, EID, 2020).
Statistical Analysis
The outcome of commercial testing was correlated to functional antibody measurements to assess
likelihood of predicting protective antibody responses. The results of the different ELISAs and RDTs were
correlated to those detected by PRNT, as the gold standard for CoV serology at various time points after
symptom onset. Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8 (https://www.graphpad.com)
and sensitivity/specificity were calculated.

Results and discussion
1. Population screening
The specificity of serological tools detecting antibodies against SARS CoV-2 might be hampered by the
presence of antibodies against other circulating coronaviruses in the population, and thus testing for cross
reactivity is crucial. In population screening during an early pandemic phase, a highly specific assay is
required, to assure an acceptable positive predictive value in populations with a low sero-prevalence 3.
This condition was met for all but one of the ELISA assays and the Liaison analyzer (Suppl table 1 and 2),
when testing serum samples from persons exposed to a range of viruses. For the rapid tests, specificity
varied more widely (Suppl table 3), using a restricted sample set.
The limited knowledge on antibody kinetics in emerging virus infections is always a challenge. A recent
study 3 did show that in both hospitalized patients and patients with mild disease, seroconversion rates
reach 100% after 10-14 days, and that antibody levels may correlate with clinical severity 2,3. This is in line
with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, in which antibody responses
varied depending on disease severity, with mild and asymptomatic infections resulting in weaker immune
responses 4. Therefore, for meaningful interpretation and extrapolation of population serology studies,
sufficient follow-up samples from persons with mild and asymptomatic disease should be included. This
patient group is underrepresented in the currently available validation data.
The golden standard for determining antibodies against coronaviruses up to present is virus
neutralization, which detects antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS CoV-2 2. Comparing the results of
the available assays to our in-house plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT50) in Figure 1A-D shows
a high sensitivity of the Wantai Ig assay using the RBD as coating antigen and detecting total
immunoglobulins. For population- based serology, assays measuring long-lived IgG isotype antibodies or
memory IgA antibodies are preferable, once these are expected to be present (from around 14 days post
onset of disease). Both IgG and IgA assays in our comparison (Liaison and Euroimmun, Fig 1B,C) clearly
demonstrate this, and especially the high-throughput Liaison system will be useful in population
screening. However, both the testing in patients with subclinical disease and longer term follow-up of
patients is needed to better understand the relationship between the antibody measurements and
neutralizing antibodies. Multiplex platforms allowing differentiation between isotypes in a single serum
sample will be an add-on to this question.
The observation that all samples testing positive in the Wantai Ig ELISA with a signal > 2 had high levels of
neutralizing antibodies suggests that - using a cut-off- this assay could be used to indicate presence of

protective antibodies, although a true correlate of protection remains to be determined. For further
quantification, linearity of the ELISA results compared to the neutralizing antibody titers was assessed.
Here, the Euroimmun IgA assay shows a good quantitative relationship, specifically once neutralizing titers
were higher than 80 (PRNT50 units), upon which the Wantai Ig assay becomes non-linear. As IgA testing
will detect both early and memory IgA responses, it will be a useful addition. The possible relevance of
quantitative antibody measurements will need to be assessed when results of longer term patient follow
up studies become available.
In addition to specialized ELISA assays used in laboratory settings, a wide range of rapid tests has been
put on the market, triggering the question whether they can be used for widespread testing. The selected
rapid tests in our evaluation provide qualitative (yes/no) results which does not allow quantification or
the definition of a cut-off for neutralization (Figure 1E,F). Although the Orient gene rapid test, showing
high specificity (Suppl. Table 3), seems useful for population screening, additional validation in patients
with mild disease is required to assess the possible under-ascertainments. An additional drawback of rapid
testing outside controlled laboratory settings is registration the poor of the results and the possible risk
that people will interpret a positive test outcome as a measure of protection.
2. Patient diagnostics
Serological testing to support clinical diagnostic work-up is mostly requested in hospitalized patients for
example when SARS CoV-2 RNA diagnostic testing remains negative in a patient despite a strong clinical
suspicion, for patients whose samples during the acute phase were not collected, or in patients with low
viral loads awaiting decision to end isolation measures. In these patients, the onset of disease is known,
as well as the clinical phase of disease. Usually these serological results are interpreted by laboratory staffs
and there is a possibility to test follow-up sera or perform confirmation serological testing. When carefully
taking into account the performance characteristics, the validated commercial ELISAs can be applied in
patient care, but the Liaison platform will lack sensitivity at early time-points. For all assays tested, it is
clear that the use of rapid tests during triage - as has been suggested in some marketing campaigns should be discouraged as the sensitivity of serology in early stage infection is too low.
In conclusion, based on our assessment to date, the RBD ELISA had optimal characteristics for use in both
population-level serological testing and patient diagnostics, including the potential to set a cut-off
indicating high levels of protective antibodies. Although some rapid tests could be used for population
level antibody screening, their performance is not robust enough for over the counter personalized
testing.
