Chyawanprash for the prevention of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers: A
Randomized Controlled Trial
Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) occurs after exposure to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). For persons who are at high risk of
exposure, the standard of care is personal protection from getting infected. Whether Ayurvedic
rasayana drug like Chyawanprash can prevent symptomatic infection in frontline health care
workers is unknown.
Objective: To evaluate the effect of the combination of Chyawanprash and Standard Preventive
Regimen compared to the use of Standard Preventive Regimen alone on the proportion of RTPCR confirmed COVID-19 infections among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs).
Methods: An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted in the HCWs between 25 to
60 years age currently working in an environment with chance of direct exposure to COVID-19
cases. The interventions to be compared in this trial were Standard Preventive Regimen as per
institutional guidelines and based on their roles (Group I) and Ayurvedic Intervention viz.,
Chyawanprash 12 g twice for 30 days from day of randomization plus Standard Preventive
Regimen (Group II). The incidence of RT PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases in both groups, was
the primary outcome measure. Evaluation of the safety of the study drug (by any statistically
significant change in various biochemical and hematological parameters and occurrence of any
adverse drug reactions); incidence of any other infective diseases (bacterial /viral/ fungal / etc.)
like upper respiratory tract illness during the study period and any change in the
immunoglobulins like IgG, IgM and IgE and inflammatory markers like TNF alpha, IL-6 and IL10 were the secondary outcome measures.
Results – Out of 193 participants who completed the study, no participant in both groups was
COVID-19 positive at the end of one month. In post intervention follow-up, 4 subjects in Group
I and 2 subjects in Group II were COVID-19 positive. No adverse drug reaction or any serious
adverse event was reported during the study. No clinically significant change in the safety
parameters was observed before and after the study. Statistically significant rise in Serum IgG
level was seen in Group II but other inflammatory and immune markers did not show statistically
significant difference.
Conclusion – Chyawanprash was well tolerated by all the participants in the intervention group
but to prove its adaptogenic effect and efficacy as an add-on to the standard care in preventing
the occurrence of COVID-19, clinical trial for longer duration with larger sample size is needed.

Introduction
Background
COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. These
droplets are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious
droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the
lungs. So, the best preventive measure is avoiding contact of the droplets until an effective
vaccine is administered. Respiratory droplets can land on hands, objects or surfaces around the
person when they cough or talk, and people can then become infected with COVID-19 from
touching hands, objects or surfaces with droplets followed by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth
as a habit. Such transmission of COVID-19 can also occur through droplets of those with mild
symptoms or those who do not feel ill.1 Transmission due to short-range inhalation of aerosols is
a possibility particularly in crowded medical wards and inadequately ventilated spaces. So, strict
adherence to Infection Prevention Control (IPC) practices especially appropriate use of Personal
protective equipment (PPE) is advised to protect the health care workers.2
Everyone is at risk of getting infected with the SARS CoV-2. In India, the first case of COVID19 was documented on 31st January 2020.3 Till first week of January 2021, 10.4 million cases of
COVID-19 were diagnosed in India, among them, 9.98 million have recovered and more than
150 thousand deaths have occurred due to COVID 19 in the country.4 Currently, care for patients
with COVID-19 is primarily supportive. Care is given to patients to help relieve symptoms and
manage respiratory and other organ failure. There are currently no specific antiviral treatments
licensed for COVID-19, however many treatments are under investigation and there is limited
evidence for the efficacy of these medicines, in the present situation.5
Till the arrival of the vaccine for prevention of COVID-19, numerous recommendations from the
health authorities were issued as prophylactic measures. The Joint Monitoring Group and the
National Task Force for COVID-19 management in India had recommended the prophylactic use
of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in asymptomatic health workers involved in containment and
treatment of COVID-19 as well as in non-COVID hospitals/non-COVID areas of COVID
hospitals/blocks; asymptomatic frontline workers, such as surveillance workers deployed in
containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in COVID-19 related activities
and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases with contraindications in
retinopathy, Hypersensitivity to HCQ or 4-aminoquinoline compounds, G6PD deficiency, preexisting cardiomyopathy and cardiac rhythm disorders, children under 15 years of age and in
pregnancy and lactation. As per the revised advisory on the use of HCQ as prophylaxis for
SARS-CoV-2 infection dated 23rd March, 2020, there is a rare possibility of cardiovascular side
effects such as cardio-myopathy and rhythm (heart rate) disorders, transient visual disturbance
including blurring of vision that needs the drug to be discontinued and so its intake is
recommended to under strict medical supervision. Its use against COVID-19, even as a
prophylaxis, needs continuous monitoring, especially in individuals with preexisting heart
conditions.6 Chloroquine as prophylaxis is contraindicated in patients with severe renal or

hepatic diseases.7 In context with controlling the spread of disease, state agencies also undertook
population-wide distribution of yet unproven homeopathic and Ayurvedic medicines and herbal
tea mixes (ukalo), claiming they boost immunity and prevent quarantined individuals from
getting infected.8 Practitioners also prescribed various other medications, including the antiparasitic drug ivermectin.9 Ivermectin is currently not recommended in the national guidelines
but can be used in patients in whom HCQ is contraindicated as per the expert opinion published
on website of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India.10
Although there is high risk of exposure during health care in the isolation wards, in the
background of community transmission, there is always a high risk of transmission to the
healthcare workers (HCWs) from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic patients reporting with
non-COVID illness also in non-COVID-19 hospitals.11 While the COVID-19 care hospitals are
equipped with specialized safety measures and PPEs, doctors who treat patients before the
hospitalisation stage (general practitioners or family physicians) are not protected similarly. N95
masks and gloves are the protective equipments recommended by the Government for the
outpatient doctors. But the HCWs who deal with patients prior to confirmed diagnoses, using
mere masks and gloves may not be protected sufficiently. Several patients hide the history of
their exposure and triaging patients into fever and non-fever categories is also not done in small
and congested clinics eventually, the healthcare workers pose more threat of getting infected in
such a scenario. The recent news report reveals that more than 87,000 healthcare workers have
been infected with COVID-19 with 9% positivity rate, with just six states viz., Maharashtra,
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, West Bengal, and Gujarat accounting for three-fourths of the case
burden and over 86% of the 573 deaths among the healthcare workforce. Possible factors
responsible for high infections include lax infection control in healthcare facilities and the lack of
stringent containment measures in areas where healthcare workers reside.12
Therefore, although the standard of care to prevent exposure to the virus containing droplets is of
utmost importance to avoid spread of COVID-19, there is a need to gather evidence for
effectiveness of certain interventions that could be safely co-administered to enhance immunity
and build strength in the host to prevent the infection especially in high risk individuals. So this
study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an Ayurvedic formulation which is categorized
as a Rasayana medicine, as an add on to the standard preventive measures, in preventing
COVID-19 infection in health care workers functioning at a COVID-19 care hospital in Delhi.
Objective of the study:
The present study was conducted to assess the impact of Chyawanprash on incidence of SARSCoV-2 (COVID 19) infection among health care personnel exposed to COVID-19 cases.

A randomized controlled trial was conducted between May 2020 to September 2020 among 199
HCWs functional at the COVID-19 Isolation Ward in Choudhary Brahmaprakash Ayurveda
Charak Sansthan’s Hospital, Khera Dabur, New Delhi, India. The study was conducted in
compliance with applicable ethical guidelines. Ethics committee approvals were obtained before
study initiation. The Study was registered with the Clinical Trail Registry of India vide
CTRI/2020/05/025275 dated 20/05/2020. The CONSORT statement guidelines have been
followed in reporting the outcomes of the study.
Study Participants
All the Health care workers of either sex functional at the said study setting during the study
period were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria after getting informed written consent.
Inclusion Criteria
All HCWs between 25 to 60 years currently working in an environment with direct exposure to
patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were eligible to participate in the trial.
Exclusion Criteria
HCWs who declined consent, who had a confirmed COVID-19 infection, those who were
already taking chloroquine/HCQ for any indication or any other prophylactic drug, pregnant or
breast-feeding women, having known co-morbidity or immune-compromised state, having
known allergy for the study drug were excluded.
Randomization
Eligible participants were allocated 1:1 in either group randomly by using a computer generated
list of random numbers. This list was generated at the headquarters of Central Council for
Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, New Delhi. This was an open label study. Assigned treatment
was known to the research team and participant. Bias was supposed to be mitigated through an
objective end point (laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection).
Study Intervention
The interventions to be compared in this trial were Standard Preventive Regimen (Group I) and
Ayurvedic Intervention viz., Chyawanprash 12 g twice plus Standard Preventive Regimen
(Group II). Chyawanprash is a classical Ayurvedic formulation. The Standard Preventive
Regimen included standard precautions like Hand hygiene, Personal protective equipment (as per
institutional guidelines and based on their roles), Respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette.
Participants were discouraged from taking any other home remedies or other preventive
measures in both groups (such as gargling with hot water etc.) throughout the study period. In the
current study Chyawanprash manufactured by Dabur India Limited was used.
Study Procedure
Participants were assessed clinically on Baseline, 7th day, 15th and 30th day for protocol
compliance and recording any adverse events if happened. As the duration of intervention was
30 days from the day of randomization, the lab investigations were done at the baseline and on
30th day.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was assessment of prophylactic efficacy of Chyawanprash as add on
intervention to the standard preventive measures adopted by HCWs in a COVID care hospital.
So the primary outcome measure was incidence of COVID-19 cases confirmed by Reverse
Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test, in both the groups.
The secondary outcomes were evaluation of safety of the study drug by comparing the
biochemical and hematological parameters before and after the study and through occurrence of
any adverse drug reactions, assessment of efficacy of Chyawanprash in preventing other
infective diseases (bacterial /viral/ fungal / etc.) like Upper respiratory tract illness through
incidence of group of symptoms like Fever/fatigue/cough/anorexia/malaise/muscle pain/sore
throat/dyspnoea/nasal congestion/headache and evaluation of effect of Chyawanprash on
immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers through comparing the levels of IgG, IgM, IgE,
high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP), Tumor Necrosing Factor alpha (TNF alpha) and
Interleukins viz., IL-6 and IL-10. The immunoglobulins and inflammatory markers were
assessed in every fifth subject in each group before and after the study.
Statistical Analysis
Sample size calculation
On the basis of assuming incidence of COVID – 19 in only 40% patients in Group I (Standard of
care) as compared to 20% in Group II (Chyawanprash as add on to the standard of care) with
95% Confidence Level (α = 0.05), 80% power and expecting a dropout rate of 20%, the number
of patients to be enrolled in the study was calculated as approximately 100 in each group.
Therefore, total sample size was 200 health care workers.
Data was collected in pre-designed Case Report Forms (CRFs) and entered in an electronic
format prepared in ms-excel. Qualitative variables are described in Number (%) while
quantitative variables are described in mean (SD) or Median (Q1, Q3). Qualitative variables in
the study have been compared using chi-square test. The quantitative variables are compared by
repeated measure ANOVA/Friedman test and paired t test/Wilicoxon sign test in within group. In
between group comparison t test/Mann Whitney test is used. The level of significance is taken at
5%.
Results
Out of total 204 HCWs screened, 199 were enrolled in the study. 95 participants in the control
group (Group I) and 98 in the intervention group (Group II) completed the study (Fig. No.1). In
Group I, 04 participants were drop outs as they didn’t want to continue participation and 02
participants in Group II were lost to follow up as they were not able to visit for follow-up.
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Baseline characteristics of the participants in both the groups were similar [Table 1]. In the
standard care group that is Group I, 50.5% participants were female, mean age was 33.35 years

and mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 24.44 kg/square meter. Whereas in Group II, in which
participants were given Chyawanprash along with standard protective measures, 59.2% were
male, mean age was 32.12 years and mean BMI was 23.56 kg per square meter. History of
allergy to some material was reported by 14.7% participants in Group I and 17.3% in Group II.
Majority of the participants in both groups had no addiction history. None of the participants had
history of COVID-19 in the family prior to enrollment in both groups. In group I almost 30%
participants had moderate to too much stress whereas in Group II 17% participants reported
having moderate to too much stress. However this difference between both groups is not
significant statistically. The participants with different work profiles were enrolled and equally
distributed in two groups. [Table 1]
Assessment of Efficacy
None of the participant in either group was found COVID-19 positive at the end of study period.
As the study revealed that no participant in any group got infected from COVID-19, we
telephonically followed the participants for next four months after completion of study period for
knowing the protection rate in both the groups. This follow-up data regarding incidence of
COVID-19 among the study participants revealed that, 04 participants in Group I showed
symptoms like fever, cough, anosmia and loss of taste and tested COVID-19 positive as
confirmed by RT-PCR, out of them 01 had to be hospitalized, whereas only 02 participants in
Group II tested COVID- 19 positive and both were asymptomatic. All the 6 participants were
diagnosed as COVID-19 positive within 2 months after completion of study period.
There was no incidence of any other infective diseases (bacterial /viral/ fungal / etc.) like upper
respiratory tract illness during the study period in both the groups.
Assessment of inflammatory and immune markers in 18 participants in each group showed that
median IgG levels increased significantly from 1337.5 (1185, 1610.4) at baseline to 1361 (1126,
1675) on 30th day in Group II (p=0.016). Median IgE levels decreased significantly in Group I
from 173 (90.5, 420) at baseline to 159 (79, 424.5) on 30th day (p=0.019), however the values
were within normal limits. All the other immune and inflammatory markers like IgM, hsCRP,
IL6, IL10 and TNF alpha did not show statistically significant changes before and after study
period in any group and all the values were within normal limits. [Table 2]
Assessment of Safety
None of the participant in either group was found COVID-19 positive at the end of study period.
No adverse event was recorded during the study. The vital parameters of all the participants were
within normal limits in both groups throughout the study. Statistically significant decrease in
mean systolic blood pressure was observed in Group II at the end of study period. However, the
change is not biologically significant [Table 3]. All the hematological parameters in both groups
were within normal limits before and after the study [Table 4]. Mean blood urea, serum
creatinine and SGOT levels were decreased in both the groups on 30th day, while total protein,
serum albumin and SGPT levels decreased and serum globulin increased in group II on 30th day.
However, all these values were within normal limits at baseline as well as on 30th day [Table 5].

The study was based on the hypothesis that Chyawanprash could potentially be used as a safe
prophylactic intervention along with standard precautionary measures, to prevent symptomatic
infection in population having high risk of exposure to SARS CoV-2 virus. But the protective
effect of Chyawanprash as an add on to the standard of care among HCWs functional at Isolation
ward in a COVID-19 Care hospital, could not be proved primarily in the present study as there
was no incidence of COVID-19 case in any group at the end of study period i.e. on 30th day.
However, in the long term follow-up after completion of the intervention period, the participants
in the study group were found to be more protected from severe infection of COVID-19 as only
2 participants were RT-PCR positive after 2 months of completion of study period and both were
asymptomatic. Whereas in the control group 4 participants were RT-PCR positive in same
duration, and one out of them had to be hospitalized.
In the current study, the immunomodulatory and adaptogenic effect of Chyawanprash was
proposed to be assessed through comparing the change in inflammatory and immune markers in
every fifth participant in both groups before and after the study. IgG levels increased
significantly among the participants taking Chyawanprash however, clinically the participants
were normal. Serum IgG is an indicator of the humoral immune response. Its level represents the
natural antibodies against antigens commonly encountered by the individual. IgG is the predominant antibody in the serum and it carries the major burden of neutralizing bacterial toxins
and binding to microorganisms to enhance their phagocytosis. The values of IgM, hsCRP, IL6,
IL10 and TNF alpha did not change significantly in any group in this study. In previous clinical
trials conducted to explore the immune-modulatory, adaptogenic and cytoprotective effect of
Chyawanprash, it is observed that, significant change in the immunity markers happens when it
is given in higher dose and for longer duration. [Table No. 6] The classical dose for avaleha
(linctus) preparation is almost 48 gram (as mentioned, 1 pala in Sharangdhar Samhita) but,
Rasayana medicines are to be administered as per the digestive capacity and strength of the
recipient. So in the present study, the standard dose of Chyawanprash as mentioned in the
Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (Vol. 1, Part II) 19 was administered that is 12 gm twice daily
and the duration of the intervention in the study only for 30 days. So this study might not have
shown results to prove its immunomodulatory effect as observed in previous clinical trials.
The current study proved the safety and tolerability of Chyawanprash through non-occurence of
any adverse drug reaction and comparison of hematological and bio-chemical parameters of the
participants before and after the study. Despite ample scientific evidence against the efficacy of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), health departments and physicians have continued to promote the
use of HCQ both prophylactically and therapeutically.7 While promoting HCQ as a possible
prophylactic solution to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the safety of the drug was demanded to be
emphasized under closer scrutiny all over the world because of its potential to cause cardiac
toxic effects and overall adverse outcomes, especially in persons with underlying coexisting
conditions that increase the risk of severe COVID-19.20 As per the revised advisory on the use of
HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19 infection published on the website of MoHFW, assessment

of HCQ prophylaxis among 1323 HCWs indicated mild adverse effects such as nausea,
abdominal pain, vomiting, hypoglycemia and cardio-vascular effects and the data from the
Pharmacovigilance program of India indicated that there have been 214 reported instances of
adverse drug reactions associated with prophylactic HCQ use, including 7 serious individual case
safety reports with prolongation of QT interval on ECG in 3 cases.21 So, if HCQ is to be used, a
clear informed choice needs to be offered to every contact, explaining the scarcity of evidence
for its efficacy and its potential risks.22 Boulware et al. reported frequent mild side effects of
HCQ.23 On the other hand, Chyawanprash is a Rasayana medicine being prescribed by
Ayurveda physicians since thousands of years to improve general body strength and vitality. It is
specially indicated in patients having chronic respiratory disorders. It can be administered in all
age groups in every season by persons having normal digestive capacity as proven by certain
studies among children.
The therapeutic value of Chyawanprash as an adjunct to anti-tubercular drug to augment their
bioactivity and prevent their side effects is proved in clinical trials.16,24 Chyawanprash is an
effective adaptogenic and antioxidant in normal people and cases of depression.25 It is proven
that the combination phyto-chemicals offers better antioxidant effects than single antioxidant
therapy.26 Chyawanprash helps to balance the three doshas viz., Vata, Pitta, and Kapha (bodily
humors/bioenergies regulating the structure and biofunctions of the human body). In the
Ayurvedic perspective, the specific actions of herbs in Chyawanprash are at the metabolic
level.27 Chyawanprash generally helps in eliminating the accumulated stool and so in improving
digestive capacity when taken regularly. This enhances the nourishment and building up of the
tissues and maintaining immune homeostasis. Chyawanprash is a potent cardiotonic. It exerts
antihyperlipidemic activity and alleviates metabolic impairments.28,29 Amla, which is the prime
ingredient of Chyawanprash, shows antiatherogenic, anticoagulant, hypolipidemic,
antihypertensive, antioxidant, antiplatelet, and vasodilatory effects, as well as lipid deposition
inhibitory properties.30,31 Chyawanprash also nourishes the brain cells, harmonizes neuronal
activities, improves memory, and enhances learning ability, storage, recall, and intellect. It
relaxes the central nervous system (CNS), thereby acting as an anxiolytic and an antidepressive,
and alleviates insomnia. Research has also suggested its procholenergic activity and antiamnesic
potential.32,33,34
Considering all the above empirically proven benefits of Chyawanprash, the drug might have
affected the digestion, metabolism and overall body strength or stamina of the participants in the
present study. It also might have had reduced the anxiety and stress and improved sleep among
HCWs. But as the study was focused to evaluate Chyawanprash as a safe and effective
prophylactic intervention against COVID-19 infection, all the above benefits were not measured
and compared. Moreover, the study was conducted at an Ayurvedic hospital functioning as
COVID Care Centre which was the only feasible study setting then, when the pandemic had
created panic among all and most general health care services were almost shut. So there are

Samnshani Vati, Giloy Juice, Tulsi Juice etc. as immunity boosters before getting enrolled in the
trial and as the study dealt with prevention of an acute infectious disease, washout period could
not be given before enrolment. The main limitations of our study were that it was done in a
single COVID-19 care centre, which was a designated government hospital with a manageable
patient load, good infrastructure and robust infection control practices. The risk of exposure here
was not as high as general OPD where asymptomatic and mild cases with initial ILI like
symptoms may be dealt before diagnosis or in other COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 public
sector hospitals with a large patient burden, limited staff, inadequate personal protective
equipment and frequent breaches in infection control practices. Secondly the participants were
not screened for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies before inclusion as the
study was designed before the first seroprevalance survey in India.35
Conclusion:
Chyawanprash can be safely administered in health care workers but its efficacy as add on
intervention to the standard measures for preventing the COVID-19 infection could be proved by
clinical study conducted for long duration with larger sample size and higher dosage of the drug
as had been effective in previous studies.

Comparison of the frequency of satellite association
in the lymphocyte cultures before and after Cp feed
after quitting betel quid chewing
58.73(14.90)- 25.20(6.83) (p 0.0001)
After cessation of Betel quid chewing, Cp can
further minimize the genotoxic effect caused by
mutagenic agents present in betel quid.
CP along with continued smoking habit, showed
that Mitotic Index was significantly lower in Cp-fed
bidi smokers (5.15) as compared with bidi smokers
(6.36) (P <0.01)
The frequency of Chromosomal Aberrations in Cpfed bidi smokers (1.00) was significantly less than
the same in bidi smokers (3.52) (P < .001)
Frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in bidi
smokers before (8.07)
and after the administration of Cp (6.50) was
significantly
decreased (P<0.005)
Frequency of Satellite Association was decreased
in the Cp-fed bidi
smokers (7.12), almost to the level of control
individuals
(5.36)
Significant increase in the erythrocyte superoxide
dismutase (an antioxidant enzyme) activity
from 1.41±0.16×103
to 1.77±0.29×103 U/gmHb (p<0.05)
