Abstract:
Objective: Report outcomes on patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and related disorders with
COVID-19 illness.
Methods: From March 16 to April 30th, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone
MS Comprehensive Care Center (MSCC) were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected
COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient
hospital records.
Results: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS of which 9 had pediatric-onset;17 with
progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). 37 underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive.
Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20
therapies (n=34, 44.7%) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators (n=10, 13.5%). The most
common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom
recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8
(10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those
hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive
disease, and a non-ambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of
hospitalization or fatal outcome.
Conclusions: Most MS patients with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs.
Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general ‘at risk’ patient population. DMT use
did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.

PARROTTA 2
Background
At present, we do not know if multiple sclerosis (MS) or disease-modifying therapies (DMT) for MS
increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19 or worsen the course (hospitalizations, ICU, death). DMT
medications have immunosuppressive effects that could hamper mounting an effective immune response
to the infection.1 On the other hand, immunosuppression could offer protection by downregulating
hyperinflammation and the cytokine storm associated with severe disease.2
New York City emerged as the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March
2020. Given the widespread prevalence of COVID-19 in our community, clinicians at the NYU Multiple
Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center (MSCCC) received numerous reports of COVID-19 infection
from patients and began systematically collecting symptom data and the clinical course. This timely,
real-world observational study on outcomes of COVID-19 in actively treated MS patients could inform
clinicians as they counsel MS patients and guide treatment decisions during the pandemic.

Methods
Demographic and clinical features were collected on patients currently followed at MSCCC and its 4
affiliated sites in the greater New York area (2 in Long Island, 2 in Brooklyn) with a history of COVID19 infection from March 16th through April 30, 2020. All patients who contacted the center with
infectious symptoms or were seen during routine teleneurology visits were queried regarding COVID-19
exposure using a standardized instrument. Inclusion criteria were any patient with MS or related
disorders who was diagnosed with COVID-19 by a healthcare provider (based on symptoms, course,
radiographic findings consistent with CDC COVID-19 criteria3 and/or positive COVID-19 PCR when
available). For hospitalized patients, in-patient records were reviewed. NYU School of Medicine
Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for the study.
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients.
Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. No imputation was made for missing
data. Differences between hospitalized patients were compared by t-test, χ2 test, or Fisher's exact test
where appropriate.
Results
A total of 76 patients met inclusion criteria, 72 (93%) with MS, and 4 (7%) with related disorders.
Average age was 44.9±15.2 years (range 13- 71) and 61.8% were female. Disease duration was
15.2±10.7 years (range 1-52). Racial breakdown was: 50 (65.8%) White, 21 (27.6%) Black, 3 (3.9%)
Asian, 1 (1.3%) Pacific Islander, and 1 (1.3%) other. Hispanic ethnicity was reported by 15 (19.7%). Of
the 72 MS patients, 55 (76.4%) had a relapsing-remitting subtype and 17 (23.6%) primary- or
secondary-progressive subtypes. Diagnoses of four non-MS patients were: neuromyelitis optica
spectrum disorder (NMOSD, n=1), chronic-relapsing-inflammatory-optic-neuropathy (CRION, n=1),
neurosarcoidosis (n=1), and myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein-IgG associated disorder (MOGAD,
n=1). 65 patients (84%) were on DMT.
Common symptoms reported included fever (68.4%), cough (68.4%), fatigue (38.2%), shortness of
breath (31.6%), and myalgias/arthralgias (26.3%). Other frequent symptoms included anosmia (22%),

ageusia (19.7%), and headache (21.1%). A subset reported neurologic symptom recrudescence (21.1%)
suggestive of relapse. In some cases, neurologic symptoms preceded viral symptoms by several days.
Of the 84% of patients on DMTs, 44.7% were treated with anti-CD20 therapies (rituximab n =18;
ocrelizumab n= 16), 13.5% on Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulators (fingolimod n= 8; siponimod
n=2), 7.9% (n=6) on glatiramer acetate, 5.3% (n=4) each on natalizumab and dimethyl fumarate and
3.9% (n=3) on beta-interferons. As shown in Table 1, there were no significant differences between
DMT use among those who were and were not hospitalized (p=0.75) or between those specifically
treated with anti-CD20 therapies (43% vs 50%, p=0.40). Table 1 summarizes outcomes by DMT class.
As shown in Table 2, of the full sample, 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized. The hospitalized vs. nonhospitalized patients were more likely to be older (51.9 vs 42.7 years), have progressive MS subtype
(38.8% vs 17.2%), be less ambulatory (50% vs. 19% requiring assistance or non-ambulatory, and have
comorbid obesity (61.1% vs 20.6%, p=0.002), coronary artery disease (16.7% vs 0%, p=0.01) and/or
history of venous thromboembolism (16.7% vs 1.7%, p=0.04).
Eight patients (10.5%) had critical illness defined by ICU admission (n=5) and/or death
(n=6). Compared to the entire MS sample, the critically ill patients were older (mean of 57.7±10.5,
range 42-71), more likely to have a progressive subtype (50.0%), and less ambulatory (62.5% requiring
assistance or non-ambulatory). Following the pattern observed in those who were hospitalized, the
critically ill group had had high rates of comorbid obesity (62.5%), coronary artery disease (25%), and
venous thromboembolism (37.5%). A detailed table of these patients has been compiled and may be
available upon request, and/or pending peer review journal acceptance.
Nine patients with pediatric-onset MS were identified as the center has a large pediatric MS sample
(Table 3). Ages ranged from 13 to 26 years; 8 were female and all had relapsing-remitting MS. Noted
comorbidities were obesity (n=3), Type I diabetes (n=1), or both (n=1). Two of the nine were
hospitalized requiring supplemental oxygen. None required invasive ventilation. Eight patients were
either fully recovered or recovering at censoring date. One remains hospitalized.

Discussion
Patients with MS and related disorders often seek guidance regarding the impact of the disease and
medication on their risk of COVID-19 infection. This observational study provides some insights
regarding COVID-19 disease course and outcomes in actively treated patients with MS and related
disorders.
The rate of hospitalization in our patients (24%) and mortality (7.9%) are in-line with the data of other
published MS patient database4 and for the general population of patients with COVID-19.5 Similar risk
factors were identified and included older age, male sex, and higher number of comorbidities identified
including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease6-8. MS-specific features associated
with more severe COVID-19 included non-ambulatory status and progressive disease course. Given the
small sample size, we could not determine whether these patients were at higher risk given their
advanced age and other comorbidities, or whether worse disability in and of itself represents an
additional risk factor for complications.

We did not observe an association between DMT class and COVID-19 outcome in univariate
comparisons, however, our sample size is small and these preliminary findings should be interpreted
with caution. There is a relatively high proportion of COVID-19 infected patients on anti-CD20
therapies (44.7%) compared to our MSCCC population in which 33.1% of patients take anti-CD20
therapies. This observation can be an artifact of data collection (such patients are more likely to have
regular visits during this period) or might represent an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection,
as has been noted with psoriasis patients on other biologic therapies9 and non-COVID-19 infections in
MS patients on anti-CD20 therapies in general.1
As a note of caution in the care of MS patients, a subgroup of individuals reported worsening of
preexisting neurologic symptoms before or at onset of COVID-19 symptoms. It is important to consider
COVID-19 in the differential of worsening neurological symptoms and to be cautious about the
indiscriminate use of steroids.
Our study has several limitations. This was a convenience sample and not randomly selected, nor was
the entire practice systematically surveyed. Patients were identified during routine teleneurology visits,
if they notified the office, or if hospitalized. This likely led to an over-representation of more
symptomatic individuals. Although we used a systematic questionnaire to collect relevant data, we could
not verify this data independently unless the patient was seen by NYU Langone-affiliated physician or
hospital. Compounding this problem was lack of access to COVID-19 testing in our area. Less than half
of our patients (48.7%) underwent SARS-COV2 PCR testing. As shown in Table 4, subgroup analysis
showed that this group was not different from the overall sample with respect to demographic or MSrelated features.
Our early experience with COVID-19 at NYU Langone MSCCC could inform clinicians taking care of
MS patients during the pandemic. Our findings suggest that individuals with MS who experience
COVID-19 have similar disease course, outcomes, and risk factors for complications as the general
population. Rigorous, population-based studies are needed to confirm our preliminary findings and
better define the risk of COVID-19 infection with respect to individual DMTs.
