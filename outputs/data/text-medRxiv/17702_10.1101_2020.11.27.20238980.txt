Abstract

36

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect communities across the globe, the need to

37

contain the spread of the outbreaks is of paramount importance. Wastewater monitoring of the

38

SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent responsible for COVID-19, has emerged as a promising

39

tool for health officials to anticipate outbreaks. As interest in wastewater monitoring continues to

40

grow and municipalities begin to implement this approach, there is a need to further identify and

41

evaluate methods used to concentrate SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA from wastewater samples. Here

42

we evaluate the recovery, cost, and throughput of five different concentration methods for

43

quantifying SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in wastewater samples. We tested the five methods on six

44

different wastewater samples. We also evaluated the use of a bovine coronavirus vaccine as a

45

process control and pepper mild mottle virus as a normalization factor. Of the five methods we

46

tested head-to-head, we found that HA filtration with bead beating performed the best in terms of

47

sensitivity and cost. This evaluation can serve as a guide for laboratories establishing a protocol

48

to perform wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction

56

As the COVID-19 pandemic impacts millions worldwide, community monitoring and early

57

detection of disease outbreaks has become of critical importance. While the rate of clinical

58

testing has seen dramatic global increases since the pandemic onset, difficulties in assessing

59

community health via this method remain (Tromberg et al., 2020). These difficulties include the

60

logistics and cost of clinical testing, and a lack of robust contact tracing protocols in most

61

communities. Moreover, the opt-in nature of clinical testing means asymptomatic and

62

symptomatic individuals who decide to forego testing are not accounted for in community

63

prevalence estimates.

64
65

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an emerging paradigm for monitoring the community

66

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (Hart and Halden, 2020). WBE has already proven to be a viable

67

method for community monitoring of other viral pathogens, including poliovirus, rotavirus,

68

hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus, noroviruses, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses, suggesting it

69

could be appropriate for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance (Hellmér et al., 2014; Kamel et al., 2011;

70

Katayama et al., 2008; Lago et al., 2003; McCall et al., 2020). This method of monitoring for

71

SARS-CoV-2 is possible due to fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and/or virus RNA

72

before, during, and after clinical symptoms manifest in infected individuals (Cheung et al., 2020;

73

Mesoraca et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020). Once feces containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA enters the

74

sewershed, the viral RNA is transported to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) where it can be

75

detected and quantified.

77

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated domestic wastewater has already been reported

78

in numerous studies from countries across the globe including Australia, Italy, the United States,

79

Japan, and more (Ahmed et al., 2020a; La Rosa et al., 2021; Sherchan et al., 2020; Torii et al.,

80

2020). Moreover, concentrations of viral RNA have been shown to correlate with community

81

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 (Stadler et al., 2020). WBE alleviates roadblocks associated with

82

clinical testing by providing a cheaper, less logistically challenging method for monitoring

83

communities. Importantly, it does not require individuals to opt-in, thereby capturing both

84

symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The potential of WBE to inform public health

85

measures by offering trend tracking and prevalence estimates is already of growing interest to

86

local governments and has been put to use by universities to proactively prevent COVID-19

87

outbreaks in campus housing (Colosi et al., 2020; Stadler et al., 2020).

88
89

The development of rapid, cost-effective, and sensitive methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-2

90

RNA in wastewater are essential for widespread, successful implementation of WBE for SARS-

91

CoV-2. Broadly speaking, the detection and quantification of viral RNA in wastewater is

92

achieved through four steps: (1) wastewater sampling, (2) wastewater concentration, (3) RNA

93

extraction, and (4) RNA quantification. There are multiple methods to choose from for each step,

94

with disparate effects on the performance and practicality of the overall measurement system. As

95

of now, there are no standard or clearly optimal methods for each step and methods are often

96

selected based on a review of the literature, author familiarity with the method, and equipment

97

and/or budget. Therefore, there is a need for the SARS-CoV-2 WBE community to better

98

characterize and directly compare different methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-2 RNA in

99

wastewater.

100
101

In this work we characterized different methods for concentrating SARS-CoV-2 RNA from

102

wastewater. We focused on the concentration step because wastewater concentration methods

103

applied for SARS-CoV-2 RNA vary widely from electronegative filtration with bead beating

104

(Ahmed et al., 2020a), electronegative filtration with elution (Sherchan et al., 2020),

105

ultrafiltration (Westhaus et al., 2021), precipitation (La Rosa et al., 2021), ultracentrifugation

106

(Prado et al., 2020), and direct extraction (Crits-Christoph et al., 2020). Moreover, differences in

107

approach, such as sample volume or whether to separate solids by centrifugation can impact

108

measurement outcomes. Without standardization, it has been difficult to compare concentration

109

methods across sites, study their relative strengths and weaknesses, optimize the methods, and

110

understand the biggest sources of RNA loss. Despite these obstacles, our recent study had

111

success in applying empirical adjustment factors to account for differences in SARS-CoV-2

112

RNA measurement methods between two labs (Stadler et al., 2020). The lack of internal

113

standards presents another caveat, as RNA recovery percentages from wastewater samples vary

114

between methods and thus non-normalized viral concentrations may impact comparisons across

115

sites. In order to address this problem, surrogate viruses can be used to estimate the recovery

116

efficiency and quantification of a target virus. Recent studies have used surrogate viruses to

117

estimate SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery percentages across a variety of methods (Ahmed et al.,

118

2020a; La Rosa et al., 2021; Sherchan et al., 2020; Torii et al., 2020). To our knowledge, only

119

one study has compared SARS-CoV-2 recovery from wastewater across methods in depth, but

120

there were significant differences between compared methods that make it difficult to pinpoint

121

the concentration step or some other factor as the source of differences (Pecson et al., 2020). At

122

least one review compared concentration methods across studies, but there is again other

123

differences between studies that make it difficult to directly compare the concentration method

124

(La Rosa et al., 2020)

125
126

In this study, we performed a head-to-head comparison of five different concentration methods

127

on samples from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Houston, TX. We evaluated the

128

methods by comparing the yields of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and sensitivity of detection by each

129

method. In addition, we compared the recovery of a spiked surrogate virus, bovine coronavirus

130

(BCoV), and the yield of a fecal indicator virus, pepper mild mottle virus (pMMoV). We provide

131

a comprehensive practical summary for each concentration method by outlining start-up cost,

132

consumable cost per sample, throughput time, limit of quantification (LoQ), and the variation in

133

N1 and N2 detection between replicate samples. Overall, this study involves an extensive

134

analysis of concentration methods currently in use to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater,

135

and an examination of BCoV and pMMoV as potential control factors.

136

137

2. Methods

138

2.1 Surrogate Preparation

139

BCoV was chosen as a surrogate and quality control measure to analyze viral RNA recovery

140

between different concentration methods. Calf Guard (Zoetis) cattle vaccine containing an

141

attenuated strain of the surrogate was used as the source for BCoV. Freeze-dried virus in 3 mL

142

vials was rehydrated in sterile conditions with 1.5 mL of TE buffer on the morning of sample

143

collection. Multiple vials were rehydrated and combined to prepare enough stock solution to

144

spike all samples. A 100 μL aliquot of BCoV was immediately stored at -80 to later determine

145

the concentration of BCoV in the stock solution.

146

2.2 Wastewater Sampling

147

Time-weighted composite samples of raw wastewater (influent) were collected every 1 hour for

148

24 hours. The collection period began the morning of Monday, October 5, 2020 and ended the

149

morning of Tuesday, October 6, 2020. Wastewater samples from 6 facilities with a range of

150

compositions, as measured by total suspended solids (TSS), carbonaceous biochemical oxygen

151

demand (CBOD), and ammonia (NH4-N), were collected to test the robustness of the different

152

concentration methods (Table 1).

taken between October 5, 2020 to October 6, 2020. All data was provided by the City of

160

Houston (Houston Public Works and Houston Health Department).

161

2.3 Wastewater Sample Collection

162

At the end of the sampling period, all samples were transported on ice to a central processing

163

facility. Larger sample volumes were aliquoted into 500 mL, Nalgene™ Wide-Mouth HDPE

164

Packaging Bottles (3121890016, Thermo Scientific) and spiked with 50 μL of BCoV stock

165

solution. Aliquots were transported on ice to Baylor College of Medicine or Rice University and

166

then stored at 4°C for further processing.

167

2.4 Wastewater Sample Concentration

168

The different concentration methods are depicted in Figure 1. Concentration occurred the day

169

following sample collection (Oct. 7). PEG concentration began the day of sample collection to

170

allow the samples to sit overnight (Oct. 6). Technical replicates were performed in triplicate for

171

each concentration method. The direct extraction, HA filtration with bead beating, and

172

ultrafiltration concentration methods were completed at Rice University. The resulting

173

concentrates were immediately transported to Baylor College of Medicine on ice for extraction.

174

HA filtration with elution and PEG methods were completed at Baylor College of Medicine.

175

Concentration methods were split between labs to reduce processing burden and because each

176

lab had more experience with their respective methods. Concentrates were stored at 4°C until

177

extraction.

178

2.4.1 Direct Extraction

179

Approximately 1 mL of sample was aliquoted into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. The sample was

180

then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 17,000 g and 4°C. The supernatant was carefully aspirated

181

without disturbing the pellet and used for extraction.

182

2.4.2 HA Filtration with Bead Beating

183

Roughly 50 mL of each sample was aliquoted into 50 mL conical tubes (1184R09, Thomas

184

Scientific) and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,100 g and 4°C. Prior to sample addition, the

185

assembled MF 3, 300ml Magnetic Filter Holder with lid kit (200300-01, Sterlitech) was attached

186

to the Multi-Vac 600-MS Manifold (180600-01, Sterlitech) and Rocker 800 Oil Free Laboratory

187

Vacuum Pump (167800, Sterlitech) system. Electronegative Microbiological Analysis

188

Membrane HA Filters (HAWG047S6, Millipore Sigma) were placed into the manifold system

189

with sterile forceps prior to the filtration process. The filters were then washed with

190

approximately 50 mL of ultrapure water before sample addition. A graduated cylinder was used

191

to measure 50 mL of supernatant which was then poured directly into the assembled filter holder.

192

After sample was added into the manifold system, 1 mL of 1.25 M MgCl2•6H2O (M0250-500G,

193

Sigma Aldrich) was added directly to the sample to achieve a final concentration of 25 mM. The

194

samples were then gently swirled with a pipette tip to homogenize and allowed to sit for five

195

minutes. The vacuum pump was subsequently turned on and allowed to pull the sample through

196

the filter. After the sample passed through the filter, the vacuum pumps were turned off, the

197

filters were rolled up with sterile forceps, and then placed into a filled bead beating tube (0.1 mm

198

diameter glass beads, Ca. No.: 11079101, BioSpec. Bead beating tube, Ca. No: 02-682-558,

199

Fisher Scientific).

200

2.4.3 HA Filtration with Elution

201

The beginning of the HA filtration with elution method was similar to HA filtration with bead

202

beating. However, centrifugation for the elution method was completed for 1 minute at 3,000 g

203

and 4°C. Furthermore, the use of EZ-Fit™ Filtration Unit (EFHAW100B, Millipore Sigma) is

204

unique to the elution method. These are sterile, single use filter holders that come with the same

205

electronegative filters used in HA filtration with bead beating. These units were used to facilitate

206

the elution aspect of the elution method. The major divergence from HA filtration with bead

207

beating is how the captured virus was recovered from the filters after filtration. After filtration,

208

filters were carefully flipped over with sterile forceps and placed back into the filter holder.

209

Next, 5 mL of 1 mM NaOH (S318-100, Fisher Scientific) eluent was placed on top of the

210

inverted filter. The back of a EZ-Fit Filtration Unit was then used to push the eluent through the

211

filter and into a 15 mL conical tube (1184R08, Thomas Scientific) containing 12.5 μL of 100

212

mM H2SO4 (A300-212, Fisher Scientific) to neutralize the NaOH. Roughly 2.5 mL of eluent was

213

collected from the setup. For concentration calculation purposes, the virus was treated as eluting

214

into 2.5 mL.

215

2.4.4 PEG precipitation

216

Solids were first removed by centrifuging wastewater in 500 mL centrifuge bottles (47735-696,

217

VWR) for 15 minutes at 7,140 g and 4°C. The supernatant was then filtered through 0.22 μm

218

Steritop Threaded Bottle Top Filters (SCGPS05RE, Millipore) into glass bottles. Then, 200 mL

219

of sample was transferred into a new sterile 500 mL bottle. Next, 16 g of PEG 8000 (8% w/v)

220

(VWRV0159-1KG, VWR) and 5.844 g of NaCl (0.5 M) (S271-1, Fisher Chemical) were added

221

to the bottle. The solution was then inverted, gently shaken by hand, and allowed to precipitate

222

overnight at 4°C. The following day, the sample was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 16,900 g and
11

223

4°C. The supernatant was then poured off and the pellet was resuspended in 2 mL of 1X PBS

224

solution (0.01 M). The 1X PBS solution (0.01 M) was prepared with 1.096 g Na2HPO4 (S375-

225

500, Fisher Chemical), 0.3148 g H2PO4Na•H2O (S369-500, Fisher Chemical), and 8.5 g NaCl

226

(BP358-10, Fisher Chemical) per liter in ultrapure water and subsequently passed through a 0.22

227

μM filter into a sterile container. 1 mL of each suspension was then aliquoted into 1.5mL

228

microcentrifuge tubes.

229

2.4.5 Ultrafiltration

230

Roughly 50 mL of each sample was aliquoted into 50 mL conical tubes. The conical tubes were

231

then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,100 g and 4°C. 50 mL of solids-free supernatant was then

232

transferred to another 50 mL conical tube and stored on ice until further processing. The

233

Amicon® Pro Purification System with 100kDa Amicon® Ultra-0.5 Devices (ACS510024,

234

Millipore Sigma) were filled with 15 mL of ultrapure water and centrifuged for 8 minutes at

235

1,900 g and 4°C. Flow through and residual concentrate were poured out. Approximately 15 mL

236

of supernatant was then loaded into each ultrafiltration device. The ultrafiltration devices were

237

then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,100 g and 4°C. Flow through was discarded, and additional

238

sample added to reach the volume limit of the ultrafiltration devices. The centrifugation and

239

discarding process was repeated until each sample had completely passed through the

240

ultrafiltration devices. As the ultrafiltration approached completion, centrifugation intervals of 3

241

minutes and 5 minutes were used to end with a final concentrate volume of approximately 1.5

242

mL. Concentrate was pipetted from the ultrafiltration devices into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes.

243

Microcentrifuge tubes containing the sample were weighed to calculate total volume of

244

concentrate.

2.5 RNA Extraction

246

Liquid samples were extracted with the chemagic™ Prime Viral DNA/RNA 300 Kit H96 (CMG-

247

1433, PerkinElmer) following manufacturer protocol. 300 μL of liquid concentrate was

248

extracted into 100 μL of sterile, nuclease free water. Extraction occurred the day following

249

concentration for all liquid samples.

250
251

Bead beating tubes containing filters from the HA Filtration with bead beating concentration

252

method were extracted by first adding 600 μL of lysis buffer from the chemagic kit. The

253

samples were then bead beaten on a FastPrep-24™ 5G bead beater (116005500, MP Biomedical)

254

for 1 minute at 5 m/s, placed on ice for 2 minutes, bead beaten for 1 minute at 5 m/s, and then

255

placed on ice. Samples were then centrifuged for 3 minutes at 17,000 g and 4°C. 300 μL of

256

supernatant was then removed and subjected to the same chemagic extraction as used on the

257

liquid samples. RNA extracts were stored at -80°C for 10 days and then transferred to -20°C for

269

After thermocycling, samples were held at 4°C for no longer than 12 hours until being read on

2.6.3 Limit of Quantification (LoQ)

289

The LoQ for ddPCR was defined as 3 positive droplets per 10,000 total droplets generated by the

290

instrument as recommended by the manufacturer. The volume of an individual droplet (0.86 nL)

291

was then used to calculate a LoQ of 0.767 gene copies/µL RNA template for a reaction setup

292

with 10 µL of RNA template.

293
294

The LoQ for RT-qPCR was determined to be 0.69 gene copies/µL RNA template for a reaction

295

setup with 4 µL of RNA template. This was the concentration of the lowest standard used in our

296

calibration curve. pMMoV was the only gene target measured through RT-qPCR, and all values

297

were significantly above this limit. Concentration factors (Table S8-S13), average percent

298

recovery, and unit conversions were then used to convert this raw LoQ to an effective LoQ

299

associated with each concentration method (Eqn. 1).

3.1 Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Wastewater with Different Concentration Methods

305

We first evaluated the effectiveness of five concentration methods at detecting and quantifying

306

the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater samples. We obtained 24 hour composite wastewater

307

samples from six different WWTPs in Houston covering a range of influent flow rates,

15

308

population sizes, and wastewater compositions (Table 1). We also created a negative control

309

sample that contains only DI water that had been spiked with the BCoV surrogate. We applied

310

each of the five different concentration methods to each sample in triplicate, extracted the RNA

311

of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and quantified the concentration of CDC target N1 and N2 using

312

digital droplet PCR (ddPCR). We then back calculated the concentration of the virus in terms of

313

copies of the virus per liter of wastewater (Figure 2A, B).

314

The concentration methods use different mechanisms to concentrate SARS-CoV-2. HA filtration

315

concentrates via manipulation of charge interactions between virus particles and filter media

316

(Cashdollar and Wymer, 2013). The addition of salts effectively replaces the repulsive

317

interactions between the negatively charged virus surface and the negatively charged surface of

318

the filter with positive-ion bridges. The bead beating method then desorbs and ruptures virus

319

particles absorbed to the filter membrane surface. In the HA filtration with elution method, an

320

eluent is added that desorbs the virus particles from the filter membrane surface into a smaller

321

volume by altering the pH. The PEG method concentrates by precipitation of virus particles upon

322

addition of polyethylene glycol and sodium chloride. Although there is uncertainty in the exact

323

mechanism, virus precipitation is believed to occur similarly to precipitation of proteins by PEG,

324

where water molecules are drawn from the solution to hydrate PEG molecules, thereby

325

increasing the effective protein concentration, making it insoluble, enabling the proteins to

326

precipitate after reaching saturation (Ingham, 1990; Yamamoto et al., 1970). Ultrafiltration

327

concentrates via size exclusion, allowing water and other small particles to pass through a filter,

328

but blocking larger sized particles like SARS-CoV-2 virus (Cashdollar and Wymer, 2013). The

329

different mechanisms involved in these concentration methods lead to different degrees of

330

recovery of SARS-CoV-2, BCoV, and pMMoV.

331

All five of the tested concentration methods were able to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2

332

RNA, but varied significantly in viral RNA titer. Direct extraction yielded the highest apparent

333

concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA across all wastewater samples. In contrast, PEG had

334

consistently lower signal for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Both methods involving HA filtration (with

335

bead beating and with elution) yielded similar concentrations that were about a half log lower

336

than direct extraction. In all cases, the resulting concentration of N1 and N2 per liter of

337

wastewater was highly dependent on the concentration method used, more so than from which

338

WWTP the sample came from. This suggests that the true concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

339

from all six WWTPs was roughly the same. It is worth noting that these measurement systems

340

may be detecting free SARS-CoV-2 RNA along with intact SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, and

341

that each concentration method may have a different ability to measure that free SARS-CoV-2

342

RNA.

343

Direct extraction yielded the highest concentrations of genome copies per L of wastewater due to

344

the fewest losses associated with concentration and the largest concentration factor applied.

345

When the results are shown in terms of the raw data, copies of N1 or N2 per µL of RNA

346

template, direct extraction had the lowest raw concentrations of viral RNA and many data points

347

were below the LoQ (as shown by the line in (Figure 2C, D). Furthermore, the only method that

348

yielded results that were consistently above the LoQ for all WWTPs and both targets was HA

349

filtration with bead beating. Because the LoQ is constant in terms of copies of RNA per µL of

350

RNA template, the method that yields the highest raw concentration of RNA per µL of template

351

is the one that produces quantifiable signal. Therefore, when evaluating concentration methods, a

352

key metric for consideration is not the genome copies per liter wastewater, but the copies per µL

353

of RNA template. In the set of methods we evaluated, we found that HA filtration with bead

17

354

beating performed the best in terms of having the highest raw genome copies per microliter of

355

RNA template and was thus consistently able to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all wastewater

356

samples tested.

357

One important decision in SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration that may impact sensitivity,

358

reproducibility, and variability is the volume of input wastewater. As input volume increases you

359

are left with a higher concentration of virus RNA in a concentrate of the same volume.

360

However, this does not come without sacrifice. In all three filtration-based methods, there is a

361

nearly exponential relationship between input volume and processing time (data not shown),

362

which can be an issue for the logistics of WBE for SARS-CoV-2. There is also an upper limit on

363

filterable volume, as pores in the filter membrane become completely blocked. In the case of

364

PEG, larger input volume means larger volumes need to be placed in centrifuges which have

365

maximum volumetric capacities and increases in startup price associated with increasing that

366

capacity by purchasing higher-powered centrifuges. Additionally, the fraction of recovered virus

367

may not stay constant for all methods with a higher volume. In the case of HA filtration

368

methods, for example, absorption sites on the filter surface may be increasingly occupied as

369

additional volume is filtered, reducing the amount of virus particles and virus RNA that can

370

absorb to the surface. All concentration methods in this study, except for direct extraction and

371

HA filtration with elution, used 50 mL of input volume. Direct extraction used 300 μL due to

372

volume limits of the extraction kit that we used, and HA filtration with elution used 25 mL due

373

to rate of filtration limits in the operating lab. An in-depth investigation into volume

374

optimization was out of the scope of this study but could be performed to improve the sensitivity

375

and reduce the variability of each of the concentration methods.

and list of equipment used can be found in S14-23.

379
380

Next, we compared characteristics related to the practicality of the different concentration

381

methods. We did this comparison to help relevant parties decide which SARS-CoV-2 RNA

382

concentration method is best suited for their situation. Laboratories might have differences in

383

availability of resources (equipment, labor) and in the number of samples requiring analysis, and

384

thus can use these results to optimize workflow.

385
386

The startup costs reflect equipment that was unique to each concentration method. Standard lab

387

equipment required by all concentration methods, such as pipettes and PPE, were not included in

19

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.27.20238980; this version posted November 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

388

these calculations. Additionally, RNA extraction costs were not included, except in the case for

389

the price of a bead beater, which is necessary to quantify RNA when using the HA filtration with

390

bead beating method. The largest factor contributing to startup costs in all cases was centrifuges.

391

The differences in startup costs was generally due to differences in cost of the specific centrifuge

392

required. A centrifuge is not necessary to perform the HA filtration with bead beating method,

393

but centrifuging samples prior to concentration to remove solids drastically decreased filtering

394

time and thus greatly increased throughput efficiency (data not shown). Pecson et al. also found

395

that a solids removal step did not show a clear impact on the quantification results of SARS-

396

CoV-2 (Pecson et al., 2020). A detailed breakdown of startup costs can be found in Table S14-

397

S18.

398
399

By far the most expensive method in terms of consumables cost per sample is ultrafiltration. The

400

Amicon® filters required by this process are expensive and not reusable. The PEG method is

401

also relatively high in cost for a similar reason; the unique bottom top filters are costly and

402

cannot be reused. It may be possible to lower costs for PEG by purchasing individual 0.22 µm

403

filters to use in a filter manifold setup, however, this would further sacrifice throughput, as time

404

would be required to rinse the manifold setup to prevent cross contamination. HA filtration with

405

bead beating and elution methods had comparable consumables costs, although the elution

406

method is more expensive due to the use of an EZ-Fit™ Filtration Unit. We do not suggest

407

reusing or replacing the EZ-Fit units to lower cost, since contact with the flipped filter and

408

underlying surface poses a large cross contamination risk if done in a repeatedly used filter

409

manifold. Direct extraction was the least expensive method since specialized consumables were

410

not required. A detailed breakdown of consumable costs can be found in Table S19-S23.

411
412

Throughput time was also assessed as different groups conducting WBE for SARS-CoV-2 have

413

varying numbers of samples and unique requirements for turnaround times needed to report data.

414

All concentration methods included a centrifugation step to remove solids in their throughput

415

time. The PEG method had the lowest throughput, largely because of the precipitation step,

416

taking at least 3 hours longer to process a batch of samples than the other methods evaluated. In

417

our study, PEG was precipitated overnight to lower the burden on lab workers, but our

418

experience with PEG concentration suggests that this time could be lowered to 4 hours without

419

lowering recovery. Other literature concentrating viruses using PEG have reduced precipitation

420

time further, but investigation of the effect of this on recovery was out of the scope of this study.

421

Ultrafiltration had the second lowest throughput due to non-filterable matter accumulation during

422

centrifugation. In centrifugation steps that allow fluid to pass directly through a filter, clogging

423

and precipitation is probable, thus increasing processing time. Direct extraction had the highest

424

throughput efficiency, since it only required a five minute solids removal step. HA filtration with

425

bead beating and HA filtration with elution had high and comparable throughputs. A detailed

426

breakdown of throughput can be found in Table S24.

427
428

We then determined the LoQ for all of the concentration methods. Here we defined the LoQ by

429

translating the minimum droplet counts required to reliably quantify gene targets (an approach

430

recommended by Bio-Rad). The minimum droplet count, 3 positive droplets per 10,000 total

431

droplets, translates to 0.767 gene copies/μL ddPCR reaction. The amount of RNA template and

432

different concentration factors between methods were then used to calculate the LoQ in Table 2.

433

PEG had the highest concentration factor of 300, leading to the lowest LoQ, while direct

21

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.27.20238980; this version posted November 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

434

extraction has the highest LoQ because there was no concentration occurring. It is important to

435

note that this LoQ does not take into account losses incurred by the different concentration

436

methods. The optimal method will balance a low LoQ with a high recovery leading to raw

437

concentrations of gene targets being significantly above the raw LoQ. We accounted for recovery

438

by averaging percent recovery of BCoV for the different methods and incorporating that average

439

into an effective LoQ. It should be noted that BCoV has yet to be identified as an optimal

440

surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 but can still provide valuable information in this context. The

441

recovery of BCoV through PEG, averaging 0.09%, was low enough to increase the effective

442

LoQ to higher than that of HA filtration with bead beating. When incorporating percent recovery

443

of the different methods, HA filtration with bead beating had the lowest effective LoQ at 2.76e5

444

gene copies/L wastewater, and was almost an order of magnitude lower (more sensitive) than the

445

other concentration methods [Table 2]. The effective LoQ is directly related to the sensitivity of

446

the concentration method, which is a critical factor in being able to reliably quantify SARS-CoV-

447

2 in wastewater samples, especially when there is relatively low community prevalence.

448

Lowering the effective LoQ relative to direct extraction is the essential reason why we include a

449

concentration step, because it makes lower concentrations of virus more reliably quantifiable.

450
451

In a study that investigated different overall processing methods for measurement of SARS-

452

CoV-2, no systematic impact by the concentration method was found for results corrected with a

453

process control (Pecson et al., 2020). As mentioned previously however, there were

454

confounding factors, such as differences in extraction and quantification steps, between the

455

different processing methods that could have skewed the comparison of the concentration step.

456

Another study investigated the recovery of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a proposed process

22

457

control for SARS-CoV-2, between multiple concentration methods with the same extraction and

458

quantification steps (Ahmed et al., 2020b). The general ranking of the recovery results for the

459

concentration methods they tested generally agree with ours in the order of best to worst: HA

460

filtration with bead beating, ultrafiltration, and PEG. A third study compared concentration of

461

MHV via PEG, ultracentrifugation, and ultrafiltration and found that ultrafiltration was the

462

preferrable concentration method for enveloped viruses of those three methods, but this study

463

based its results on the quantification of live virus and not virus RNA (Ye et al., 2016). They

464

suggest that PEG is a preferred method only for non-enveloped viruses. Overall, our study our

465

study controlled for different confounding factors and directly measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA,

466

unlike these previous two studies.

467

3.3 Recovery of corrective surrogates

468

In addition to SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we compared the concentrations of BCoV and pMMoV RNA

469

in the WWTP samples processed via the different concentration methods. Each wastewater

470

sample was immediately spiked with a known concentration of BCoV upon reception at the

471

collection site. Samples that had passed through concentration and extraction protocols were then

472

analyzed through ddPCR (BCoV) and qPCR (pMMoV) to determine their concentrations in the

473

wastewater samples.

474

3.4 Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) Process Control

475

A process control is necessary when exact RNA recovery efficiency of the target component

476

across different processing steps is unknown, or when determining these recoveries may be

477

impractical. By spiking in a known concentration of the process control at the beginning of the

478

process or at different stages throughout the process and comparing the measured concentration

23

479

to the expected concentration, it is possible to determine the overall recovery of the process

480

control and loss of the process control during sample processing. If the process control has been

481

validated, and is known to behave in a way similar to the target component, then these losses can

482

be incorporated into the measured concentration of the target component to estimate a “true”

483

measure of the target component in the sample. Process controls can also be used simply as

484

positive controls to ensure that nothing went awry during sample processing and analysis.

485
486

Recent SARS-CoV-2 WBE studies have used a variety of process controls, including MHV

487

(Ahmed et al., 2020b), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Mlejnkova et al., 2020),

488

human coronavirus (HCoV 229E) (La Rosa et al., 2021), Phi 6 (Sherchan et al., 2020), bovine

489

respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) (Gonzalez et al., 2020), and BCoV (Gonzalez et al., 2020).

490

However, no single process control has proven, as of yet, to be significantly more indicative of

491

SARS-CoV-2 recovery than other process controls. In this work we sought to assess BCoV as a

492

process control by comparing its recovery across different methods and wastewater samples

493

against the yields of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

494
495

We chose BCoV because of its similarity to SARS-CoV-2, as both viruses are part of the genus

496

Betacoronaviridae. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, generally spherical in shape with mild

497

pleomorphism (60-140 nm diameter) and a 29.9 kb length genome (Zhu et al., 2020). BCoV is a

498

pleomorphic (65-210 nm diameter), enveloped RNA virus with a 27 - 32 kb length genome (Saif,

499

2010). Both BCoV and SARS-CoV-2 carry a spike (S) glycoprotein on their envelope surface,

500

while only BCoV carries an additional, large protein on its envelope surface known as

501

hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein (Saif, 2010). Apart from structural similarity, BCoV is

The magnitude of recovery of BCoV reflected the magnitude of recovery of N1 and N2 across

506

concentration methods. Like N1 and N2, the highest to lowest recovery of BCoV from the

507

different concentration methods occurred in the order of direct extraction, HA filtration with

508

bead beating, HA filtration with elution, ultrafiltration, and finally PEG. Overall, this suggests

509

that BCoV could be a good surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 as relative recovery of BCoV across

510

concentration methods mirrors the relative recoveries of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is some

511

difficulty in directly comparing recovery of N1 and N2 to BCoV due to the number of N1 and

512

N2 measurements that were below the LoQ for ddPCR. Additionally, it is not clear what the

513

dominant forms (intact viral particle vs free RNA) of BCoV and SARS-CoV-2 are when they

514

reach the concentration step of the measurement process and how this affects concentration.

515

More research is needed to characterize the form of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and understand

516

how the form impacts concentration to inform the choice of an appropriate surrogate.

517
518

Interestingly, DI water controls spiked with BCoV showed significantly different levels of

519

recoveries compared to wastewater samples concentrated via the same method. One potential

520

explanation for this could be rupture of the viral particles due to a large difference in osmotic

521

pressures across viral capsid/envelope in DI water. Rupture may not occur in wastewater

522

samples due to a significant amount of dissolved compounds reducing differences in osmotic

523

pressure inside and outside of the viral particle. Thus, the disparate concentration methods may

524

have different effects on ruptured versus unruptured virus.

3.5 Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (pMMoV) Normalization Factor

526

There are many factors that affect wastewater concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between

527

excretion in feces and quantification in the lab that potentially confound translation of

528

concentration to community prevalence. While a process control, like BCoV, can be used to

529

account for factors during the measurement process (i.e. between sampling and quantification), a

530

normalization factor attempts to account for factors during the measurement process and

531

additional upstream factors, like dilution in the sewer system.

532
533

pMMoV has been suggested as a promising normalization factor for SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al.,

534

2020). It is the most abundant RNA virus found in human feces due to its origin in peppers and

535

pepper containing products and has previously been proposed as a water quality and fecal

536

pollution indicator (Kitajima et al., 2018; Rosario et al., 2009). In theory, it is excreted in

537

relatively consistent amounts in humans across a population and will travel alongside SARS-

538

CoV-2 viral particles and viral RNA in the conveyance system, experiencing the same

539

conditions. pMMoV is a rod-shaped (~312 nm length), non-enveloped RNA virus with a 6.4 kb

540

length genome in the Tobamovirus family (Kitajima et al., 2018). Due to a number of structural

541

differences between pMMoV and SARS-CoV-2, pMMoV is better used as a fecal indicator than

542

as a corrective process control.

543
544

Direct extraction showed the highest recovery of pMMoV in all the wastewater samples (Figure

545

3). Three other methods, HA filtration with bead beating, HA filtration with elution, and

546

ultrafiltration showed roughly equivalent recoveries of pMMoV. The PEG method had the

26

547

lowest recoveries of pMMoV of all the concentration methods. All of the resulting pMMoV

548

measurements, with the exception of two, were well above the LoQ.

549

The relative effectiveness of direct extraction and the PEG method compared to the other

550

concentration methods was about the same between measurement of pMMoV and measurement

551

of N1 and N2. However, while HA filtration with bead beating, HA filtration with elution, and

552

ultrafiltration were roughly equivalent for pMMoV, HA filtration with bead beating recovered

553

the most N1 and N2 of the three respective concentration methods.

554
555

A number of differences between pMMoV and SARS-CoV-2 may be the cause of these

556

differences. For example, it may be that the protein capsid and envelope of SARS-CoV-2 are

557

easier to rupture via bead beating than the sole protein capsid of pMMoV. Alternatively, it is

558

possible that the forms of the virus are different after conveyance in the sewers system. One of

559

the viruses may primarily exist in the form of free RNA due to decay of their envelope and/or

560

protein capsid, while the other virus may be largely intact. It is currently not clear what form

561

either pMMoV or SARS-CoV-2 are in when they reach the concentration step, how these forms

562

impact concentration, or how different characteristics of the two viruses impact concentration,

563

but they are areas that should be explored further.

564

3.6 Variability of measurement between concentration methods with BCoV and pMMoV

565

The variability of measurements between each concentration method was determined using the

566

coefficient of variance (CV) for BCoV and pMMoV (Table 2). The lower the CV, the lower the

567

variability and the higher confidence one can have in a measured value. Further, if CV is low

568

enough, it may be reasonable to reduce replicates (i.e. from triplicates to duplicates) to save on

569

cost and throughput. The CV was measured for each WWTP for a particular method and then

27

570

averaged for all WWTPs in the method to get the CV of the whole method. The PEG method

571

showed the highest average CV, while the HA filtration with bead beating method had a

572

generally low CV for both BCoV and pMMoV. As of now, it is not clear what causes the

573

difference in variability between each concentration method. We chose not to directly

574

incorporate CV of N1 and N2 gene targets because a large proportion of measurements were

575

below the LoQ. Therefore variability in N1 and N2 would be more attributed to the

576

quantification procedure that was used to establish the LoQ as opposed to variability caused by

577

the particular concentration method. Between BCoV and pMMoV, the BCoV CV is likely a

578

better indicator of a potential SARS-CoV-2 CV due to BCoVs higher structural similarity to

579

SARS-CoV-2 than pMMoV.

580
581

4. Conclusion

582

By directly measuring N1, N2, BCoV, and pMMoV, we assessed the recovery and practicality of

583

different concentration methods required for SARS-CoV-2 WBE. HA filtration with bead

584

beating showed high recovery of all gene targets at a significant distance above the LoQ, leading

585

to low variability across measurements. The same method also demonstrated relatively moderate

586

startup costs, low cost per sample, and high throughput. HA filtration with bead beating is

587

therefore a preferred concentration method in many situations from the perspective of recovery

588

and practicality. Additional attention should be paid optimizing the sensitivity and recovery of all

589

concentration methods. Future work should also identify the form of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and

590

establish how this affects measurements via the different concentration methods. Additionally,

591

more work needs to be done to determine the best process controls and normalization factors for

592

SARS-CoV-2. The WBE for SARS-CoV-2 community needs to identify process controls and

Figure 1: Overview of the evaluated concentration methods. Wastewater samples were
collected from several wastewater treatment plants across Houston in sample collection bottles
and immediately spiked with BCoV (top). a-e): The samples were then concentrated through
several methods: a) direct extraction, b) HA filtration with bead beating, c) HA filtration with
elution, d) PEG precipitation, and e) ultrafiltration. All concentrated samples subsequently
underwent RNA extraction. Samples undergoing direct extraction were not concentrated and
instead were directly extracted from the liquid phase of the wastewater samples.
