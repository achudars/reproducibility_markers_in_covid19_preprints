Abstract

40

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created major public health and socio-economic

41

challenges across the United States. Among them are challenges to the educational system where

42

college administrators are struggling with the questions of how to reopen in-person activities

43

while prioritizing student safety. To help address this challenge, we developed a flexible

44

computational framework to model the spread and control of COVID-19 on a residential college

45

campus. The modeling framework accounts for heterogeneity in social interactions, activities,

46

disease progression, and control interventions. The relative contribution of classroom, dorm, and

47

social activities to disease transmission was explored. We observed that the dorm has the highest

48

contribution to disease transmission followed by classroom and social activities. Without

49

vaccination, frequent (weekly) random testing coupled with risk reduction measures (e.g. facial

50

mask,) in classroom, dorm, and social activities is the most effective control strategy to mitigate

51

the spread of COVID-19 on college campuses. Moreover, since random screening testing allows

52

for the successful and early detection of both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, it

53

successfully reduces the transmission rate such that the maximum quarantine capacity is far

54

lower than expected to further reduce the economic burden caused from quarantine. With

55

vaccination, herd immunity is estimated to be achievable by 50% to 80% immunity coverage. In

56

the absence of herd immunity, simulations indicate that it is optimal to keep some level of

57

transmission risk reduction measures in classroom, dorm, and social activities, while testing at a

58

lower frequency. Though our quantitative results are likely provisional on our model

59

assumptions, extensive sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of their qualitative nature.

Introduction

63

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created major public health and socio-economic

64

challenges across the United States. Among them are challenges to the educational system. After

65

the 2020 Spring Break, many colleges and universities in the U.S. sent residential students home

66

and transitioned partially or completely to remote learning as an attempt to reduce the risk of

67

COVID-19 transmission on their campuses. Though such a policy may have contributed to

68

reducing the spread of the disease on college campuses as well as their surrounding

69

communities, it resulted in severe financial and potential academic losses for many colleges. In

70

an attempt to mitigate these losses, college administrators are struggling with the questions of

71

how to reopen in-person activities while prioritizing student safety. In August, 2020, over a third

72

of US colleges and universities had fully in-person classes and around 20% chose to be hybrid (a

73

mix of in-person and remote classes) [1]. Many of these reopenings were followed by campus

74

outbreaks that led universities, including the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC)

75

and the University of Notre Dame, and Indiana, to shut down or impose increased restrictions

76

once again.

77

In the absence of vaccination and proven treatment, control strategies have focused on

78

social/behavioral factors and preventive strategies such as facemask, reduced class size, reduced

79

social gatherings/events size, and reduced residence hall (dormitory) occupancy to share the

80

common utilities, bathrooms, and so on. Those strategies were combined with regular testing to

81

rapidly detect and quarantine infected students. Previous modeling studies have investigated

82

different aspects of COVID-19 spread on college campuses [2-7]. For example, Paltiel et al. [8]

83

used a simple homogeneous mixing SEIR compartmental model to evaluate the effectiveness of

84

screening strategies in a college with 5000 students; Weeden and Gornwell [9] designed student

85

contact networks though transcript data and used these networks to studied the effectiveness of

86

small course enrollments on reducing the risk of epidemic spread. Gressman and Peck [10] used

87

a full-scale stochastic agent-based model (ABM) of a reasonably large research university to

88

conclude that testing accuracy is a critical issue and holding large classes greatly increases the

89

risk of a significant outbreak on campus. Goyal et al. [11] also developed an ABM that

90

incorporates important features related to risk at the University of California San Diego to assess

91

the potential impact of strategies to reduce outbreaks. They found that increased frequency of

92

asymptomatic testing from monthly to twice weekly has minimal impact on average outbreak

93

size, but substantially reduces the maximum outbreak size and cumulative number of cases.

94

Inspired by their work, we developed an individual-based model to quantitatively assess the

95

relative contribution from class, dorm, and social activities on the COVID-transmission and to

96

quantitatively assess different control strategies such as screening and test with different

97

frequency, class-size, dorm-size, and social-size control.

98

Even though vaccination of college students has started on most college campuses in the US,

99

outbreaks could continue occurring due to incomplete population coverage and the appearance of

100

new virus variants as the effect of vaccines on viral transmission and new virus variants are

101

currently unknown [12, 13]. Given these uncertainties, university administrators are still

102

determining to what degree they should continue adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions.

103

Challenges of Covid transmission and college specifics

104

Mathematical models are powerful tools to explore disease transmission, and the complex

105

landscape of intervention strategies to quantify and assess different options. One of the key

106

challenges in modeling the spread of Covid-like pathogens in local communities is an efficient

107

account (parameterization) of human social interactions. Conventional approach (population-

108

based) employs a simplified form of social interactions based on ‘mean contact rate/host’ [14,

109

15]. To address this limitation, individual-based modeling has been widely used in the study of

110

pathogen spread and infection control, including Covid-19 [16-22]. Some have used individual-

111

based models (IBM) where a community is viewed as a randomly colliding system of ‘host-

112

particles’, whereby ‘infectives’ transmit the pathogen to ‘susceptibles’ via random collisions.

113

The intensity (rate) of transmission is proportional to mean contact rate. On the opposite side are

114

IBM based on social network structure where transmission pathways are confined to one's

115

‘neighbors’ - adjacent nodes on the social network [23]. In real life human social contact mixing

116

combines both random and scheduled (prescribed) contacts. Our proposed approach differs from

117

previous works in two important aspects: 1) the basic transmission step in our model is 'many-to-

118

many' [24] vs. conventional 'one-to-one'; 2) we keep a detailed account of daily social

119

interactions.

120

Here, we developed a flexible computational framework to model the spread of COVID-19 on a

121

residential college campus. The modeling framework accounts for heterogeneity in social

122

interactions, activities, disease progression, and control interventions. This allows us to generate

123

and simulate more realistic synthetic college communities using a handful of basic inputs that

124

combine scheduled and random contacts, and prescribed patterns of disease progression.

125

Materials and Methods

126

Two basic components of college IBM include (i) college community and its social interaction

127

patterns and (ii) infection transmission and disease progress. College community is made of

128

individual student hosts (other population groups such as faculty and staff could be added). They

129

are engaged in their daily activities (classes, dorm residence, social mixing). As a pathogen is

130

introduced into such a community it could spread via social interactions.

131

I)

Student body and social mixing is made of scheduled and random contacts (See

132

Figure 1). Scheduled contacts include classes with assigned seating, and dorm

133

residence. Random social mixing consists of daily aggregation in contact pools of

134

different sizes and frequencies.

II)

135

Disease progression. In our model, the infection stages are classified as susceptible

136

(S), infected (I), and recovered (R) stages (See Figure 1). Once infected, each

137

individual undergoes a prescribed infection progress pattern determined by stage

138

duration and time-dependent infectivity (See Figure 2(A)). We partition the host

139

population into two groups: asymptomatic and symptomatic. Each one undergoes SIR

140

transitions of prescribed duration and pattern of the I-stage. In our setup variable

141

(dynamic) infectivity serves as a proxy for viral load, a predictor for symptomatic

142

expression, and diagnostic test sensitivity (See Figure 2(B)).

143

Social interactions

144

Social mixing is implemented in our IBM via contact pools where students aggregate on a daily

145

basis. Two types of contacts are considered:

146

(i)

147

Scheduled contacts:
(a) Classes. We generate a class schedule, including a seat assignment, for every student in

148

our college. We assume that each student has three randomly selected non-overlapping

149

classes. Classes are assigned to meet on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday (MWF)

150

schedule or on a Tuesday and Thursday (TuTh) schedule. All classes are assigned to a set

151

of days and a time slot.

152

Each class has a prescribed student seating in the classroom and weekly schedule.

153

Students are assigned specific seats in each class period. Based on their seating pattern,

154

an infected individual can spread the pathogen to his/her neighbors within a prescribed

155

radius (Figure S1). Probability of transmission drops with longer distance.

(b) Housing/dorm. A particular form of scheduled contact whereby students aggregate in

157

shared units, halls, utilities etc. In our baseline setting, we randomly divide all students

158

into non-overlapping groups with 7 occupancy per group.

159

(ii)

Random social mixing. We simulate random social mixing using a specified pool size

160

distribution. Specifically, students randomly aggregate on daily basis in contact pools of

161

prescribed sizes m1 ; m2 ;... , and frequencies f1 ; f 2 ;... . The latter accounts for an average

162

number of mixing pools of a given type (per host per day), a proxy for their social-

163

contact preferences. The real number of mixing pools of size mi is equal to Nfi ( N -total

164

student body size). As each m-pool creates m(m − 1) daily contacts, the mean contact

numbers {m1 ; m2 ;...};{ f1 ; f 2 ;...} . More refined contact pools can be generated from the

social network makeup of the host community.

on a daily basis, and provide the key transmission mechanism from infected to

171

susceptibles. Furthermore, a host could partake in several daily activities, and thereby

172

accumulate his/her exposure, or contribution to disease spread. We assume each type of

173

activity (class, dorm, and social) takes place in a suitable environment, and each

174

environment has an has an associated mean risk factor (ac , ad , as ) . These factors

175

(0 < ai < 1) mitigate the probability of transmission (exposure risk) in a given

176

environment, They vary from 0 (full protection) to 1 (full exposure). In this form they

177

could also be the target of control strategies. More generally, risk factors could be made

178

site-specific (classroom and/or other place of activity). Combined with individual

179

infectivity, environmental risk factors determine the probability of I ->S transmission as

180

elaborated in the next subsection.

181

Note that the risk factors (ac , ad , as ) associated with three transmission environments (class,

182

dorm, and social) are highly uncertain and could vary in different colleges. Hence we explore a

183

range of choices of environmental risk factors: three choices (low, moderate, high) for three

184

environmental risk factors; Besides, we also consider two choices of random social mixing

185

cluster sizes (mean contact rate (MCR) =3, MCR=6). Other parameters of disease progression

186

are reasonably chosen based on literature (See Table S3).

187

Infection and disease progress

188

Different hosts can undergo different disease processes in the I-stage. Here for simplicity we

189

partition the host population into two groups: asymptomatic or symptomatic. The key difference

190

between two is the stage duration and the infectivity function profile. In our setup asymptomatic

191

hosts have shorter duration and lower infectivity [25, 26]. Asymptomatic hosts do not exhibit

192

symptoms over the duration of I-stage, but are still capable of transmitting the pathogen. In

193

contrast, Symptomatic hosts would exhibit disease symptoms after their incubation period.

194

The key quantifier of disease progress in the I-stage, is host infectivity function or post infection

195

b(d ) day d . We view it as a proxy for variable viral load in the course of infection. It follows a

196

prescribed dynamic pattern (shown in Figure 2(A)); specifically we use function B(t ) = t k e − kt of

197

steepness k , and define b(d ) = bM B(d ) where bM is peak infectivity and L is the mean
L

198

duration. Each I-host would progress according to his/her b(d ), and such patterns could be made

199

individual. But in the current version we partitioned host population into two groups:

200

asymptomatic and symptomatic with different parameters choices for (bM ; k ; L) (see Table S3).

201

The infectivity function b(d ) determines the probability of transmission per contact from an

202

infected I-host to a fully susceptible S-host. Hence, we employ it to estimate transmission rates

203

within contact pools. We also use it (timing d ) as a predictor for symptomatic isolation, and

204

values of b(d ) for predicting positive test diagnostics in screening (See Figure 2(B)).

205

Host infection ( S → I ) is modeled as a Bernoulli random process with the success probability

206

determined by cumulative daily contact pools of a given susceptible -host. In each contact pool,

207

scheduled or random (class, dorm, social mixing), we estimate the survival probability (staying

208

uninfected) depending on the pool's makeup, and the associated-environmental risk factor.

209

Specifically, a contact pool with m infectives with infectivity levels {b1 ;...; bm } , and

210

environmental risk factor a gives a survival probability of an S-host,=
ps

m

∏ (1 − ab ) . Note that
i =1

i

211

the classroom setting is somewhat different from other contact pools, as the probability of

212

survival depends not on the entire body of infected classmates, but only on the ‘nearest infected

213

neighbors’ determined by classroom seating (see SI for details). Several contact pools for a given

214

S-host, could accumulate over a daily period; they determine the final probability of infection,

215
216

pI = 1 − psc  psd  pss , where psc , psd , pss are survival probabilities in class, dorm and random
social mixing.

217

Control interventions

218

Our IBM setup allows us to investigate a wide range of interventions, including (i) symptomatic

219

isolation, (ii) scheduled and random test screening at prescribed weekly schedule; (iii) regulation

220

of class size, dorm occupancy, or social mixing makeup; (iv) vaccination. Furthermore, each

221

transmission environment (classroom, dorm, social) has an associated environmental risk factor

222

which affects the probability of transmission in the setting. These risk factors account for

223

physical conditions (e.g. seat density in classrooms, specifics of dorm units), and behavioral

224

practices (e.g. adherence to face mask or other protective means during contacts). Such

225

environmental inputs are highly uncertain and we explore a range of choices to assess their

226

impact on disease outbreaks and the effectiveness of control strategies.

227

Different control strategies can be compared in terms of their efficacy in mitigating an outbreak.

228

For quantitative assessment of control interventions and their impact, we use two measurements:

229

(i) outbreak size (the cumulative infection by the end of a given time period (e.g. 16-weeks

230

semester) relative to total population); (ii) daily maximal quarantine number estimated from the

231

quarantine pool over the outbreak period. The latter could provide some guidelines to the

232

University administration on how many quarantine rooms to prepare in advance, and could also

233

give a simple economic measure of outbreak impact and putative intervention. Those are

234

estimated and compared with baseline cases to assess the efficacy of control.

Results

246

Outbreak in naive host community

247

We generate a synthetic medium-sized (6000) and a small-size (3000) college community with

248

all students residing in dorms: no intervention (only depends on disease, social mixing, and

249

environment), no pre-existing immunity, and no external source of infection. All results with the

250

6000 student body are represented here, and with the 3000 student body are put in (See Figures

251

S3-S8 in SI). A naive host population is initialized with a few infected individuals.

252

Typical outbreak patterns and parameter sensitivity: baseline cases

253

A typical outbreak pattern and duration depends on transmission intensity. Under high

254

transmission intensity, outbreaks are localized within a limited range (typically less than a 16-

255

week academic semester). However, if transmission intensity is low, they could last much longer

256

and won’t be terminated by the end of semester (See Figure 3).

257

All our college simulations were run over a 16-week academic semester. Under high

258

transmission intensity (e.g. high environmental risk), almost all students got infected by the end

259

of a 16-week semester. Therefore, the outbreak size distribution is localized (shown in Figure

260

3(A) and Figure 4). However, low transmission intensity creates a highly dispersed statistical

261

outcome by the end of the 16-week semester, as not all random histories are terminated (See

262

Figure 3(B) and Figure 4). The dispersal also grows larger for smaller student bodies (see details

263

Figure S3 in SI, for a 3000 student body).

264

To compare Panel (A) with Panel (B) in Figure 4, we can see that random social mixing size also

265

plays an important role in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in college students. From now on,

266

the following experiments are implemented in the setting of the mean contact rate (MCR) of

267

random social mixing =6.

268

To further explore and assess the relative contribution of three environments (class, dorm, and

269

social) on outbreak size, we fixed other parameter values to see what would happen if one

270

environment is ignored, as shown in Figure 5. We observed the relative contribution of the dorm

271

was most significant followed by class and social mixing. Such conclusions could be provisional

272

on our assumptions about dorm, class, social make-up.

273

Analysis of intervention

274

Baseline case with symptomatic quarantine

275

We start with a simple scenario (symptomatic quarantine only) shown in Figure 6. We assume

276

that an infected individual would start showing symptoms at around 7 days, based on our time-

277

dependent infectivity level for symptomatic pathways shown in Figure 2. 70% random selection

278

of those individuals showing symptoms are put into quarantine, where they do not mix and

279

transmit the pathogens. Compared with Figure 4 where no control intervention applied, the

280

symptomatic quarantine only scheme (Figure 6) may work fine for the case that we have really

281

good control of risks from all three environments (class, dorm, and social), but definitely not

282

enough for those cases with moderate and high risk factors. In the latter, the scheme has minimal

283

impact on the outbreak size, but raises a significant economic burden to do quarantines.

284

The clue to low efficacy of symptomatic screening lies in (i) transmission rate is still high,

285

though symptomatic quarantine tries to lower it; (ii) the role of asymptomatic individuals in

286

transmission and the delay of detection. To test (i)-(ii) in the following subsection, we first

287

selected five typical cases from Figure 6 (70% symptomatic quarantine only) as our baseline

288

cases: MMM (the first letter represents the risk level for class, followed by dorm and social),

289

LMH, MHL, HLM, and HHH. For example, LMH means low risk factor for class, moderate risk

290

factor for dorm, and high risk factor for social activity.

291

Class, Dorm, and Social size regulation

292

We then consider the following means of social control: reduced class size, dorm occupancy,

293

random mixing pools, coupled with 70% symptomatic quarantine: (i) class size reduction at 25%

294

and 50% is achieved by randomly selecting a fraction of students to attend in-person from the

295

original class enrollment. While removed from their classes the remaining fraction could still

296

contribute to transmission through other activities; (ii) dorm occupancy per unit is similarly

297

reduced by 25%, 50%; (iii) random social mixing is reduced by 50%, via regulating pool sizes

298

and their frequency; (iv) combined interventions: (a) 25% class-size reduction + 25% dorm-

299

occupancy per unit reduction, (b) 50% class-size reduction + 50% dorm-occupancy per unit

300

reduction, (c) 50% class-size reduction + 50% dorm-occupancy per unit reduction + 50% mean

301

contact rate of random social mixing reduction.

302

Figures 7-8 and Table 1 show the effect of above interventions on relative outbreak size and

303

maximum quarantine capacity, respectively. The last scheme, 50% class-size reduction + 50%

304

dorm-occupancy-per-unit reduction + 50% mean contact rate of random social mixing reduction,

305

could prevent an outbreak with some control on environmental risks, but still would lead to

306

failure if there is no control on environmental risks. Overall, the effect of class, dorm, and social

307

mixing size regulation is highly dependent on the risk control (e.g., wearing facial masks in

308

class, dorm, and other social activities) in those three environments. Moreover, the reduced

309

transmission would lead to a lower number of quarantine rooms, which reduces the economic

310

burden of the University.

311

Screening and Tests

312

Next, we explore different Screening and Test policies coupled with 70% symptomatic

313

quarantine as follows: (i) we assume that the University is capable of doing about 7% of

314

population screening capacity and tests per day from randomly selected pools (i.e., about 100%

315

of the population every two week). The sensitivity of the test is assumed to be time-dependent

316

for both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals (Figure 2); (ii) we assume that the

317

University is capable of doing 14% of population screening and tests per day from randomly

318

selected pools (i.e., about 100% of the population per week).

319

Note that the above two Screening and Test policies are coupled with daily random 70%

320

symptomatic quarantine (i.e., an infected individual is assumed to start showing symptoms at

321

around 7 days of infection, then 70% random selection of those individuals showing symptoms

322

are put into quarantine).

323

Figure 9 and Table 2 show that the high frequency of screening and tests is an effective control

324

strategy to mitigate and even prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 in colleges coupled with some

325

control of the risk factors in class, dorm, and social environments. Moreover, since random

326

screening testing allows for the successful and early detection of both asymptomatic and

327

symptomatic individuals, it successfully reduces the transmission rate such that the maximum

328

quarantine capacity is far lower than expected to further reduce the economic burden caused

329

from quarantine.

330

Vaccination scenarios

331

Here we assume two simple vaccine scenarios (i) 50% students are vaccinated with 95% efficacy

332

(ref), so we simply assume 50%*95%=47.5% students are fully protected (See Figure 10(A));

333

(ii) 80% students are vaccinated with 95% efficacy, i.e., 76% students are fully protected (See

334

Figure 10(B)). We then explore the effect of lifting the screening and testing with less frequency,

335

e.g., testing every week, every two weeks, every 4 weeks, every 8 weeks, and no random

336

screening at all (i.e., symptomatic screening only). We selected five typical cases as our baseline

337

cases: MMM (the first letter represents the risk level for class, followed by dorm and social),

338

LMH, MHL, HLM, and HHH. A simple conclusion is that the herd immunity can be achieved as

339

a result of 50% to 80% vaccination. When herd immunity is not reached, it is optimal to retain

340

some level of environmental risk control on class, social and dorm (e.g., the use of facial masks).

341

The impact of random screening was shown to be less important compared to environmental risk

342

control.

Discussion

345

Controlling the spread of COVID-19 is a critical challenge for colleges and universities planning

346

to reopen on-campus educational, research, sports, and social activities in the fall. Even though

347

the vaccination of college students has started on many college campuses across the US, it may

348

not by itself prevent an outbreak due to incomplete coverage. University administrators are still

349

wondering to what degree they should continue to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions

350

and what are the most efficient control strategies.

351

To capture the disease dynamic on campus and answer those questions, we developed an

352

individual-based model (IBM) of COVID-19 transmission that accounts for heterogeneity in

353

social interactions, disease progression, and control interventions. Since social mixing plays an

354

important part in COVID-19 transmission, we considered two basic types of mixing typical for

355

college communities: (i) scheduled contacts (classes and dorm residence), (ii) random contacts

356

(e.g., dining and/or other forms of unstructured social activity). Once infected each host

357

undergoes a prescribed disease progression history, with a time-dependent infectivity pattern,

358

viewed as a proxy for variable viral load during the course of infection. Such a computational

359

framework allows us to generate and simulate more realistic college communities than standard

360

SEIR models [8], and quantitatively assess the efficacy of different intervention strategies.

361

In our IBM setup, daily activities (class, dorm, and social mixing) takes place in a suitable

362

environment, and each environment is assumed to have an associated risk factor (ac , ad , as ).

363

These factors may mitigate the probability of transmission (exposure risk) in a given

364

environment (0 < ai < 1). So they could represent site-specific control interventions (e.g.,

365

wearing facial masks, or providing clean contact space). Since these factors are highly uncertain

366

and could vary in different colleges, we explore a range of choices of environmental risk factors,

367

by taking three values (low, moderate, high) of each environmental risk factor (dorm, class,

368

social mixing). Another control focus could be social activities (pool sizes). Our numeric

369

simulations and analysis indicate that mixing-pool size could play an important role in

370

containing COVID-19 outbreaks. We assessed the relative contribution of three environmental

371

risk factors on outbreak size. Among these, the dorm risk was found as most significant,

372

followed by classroom risk, and random social mixing. However, this observation is provisional

373

on the underlying assumptions of the model about dorms, classrooms, social make-up.

374

A simple intervention based on symptomatic quarantine only was shown to have minimal impact

375

on the outbreak size. The low efficacy of the symptomatic screening is due to the large

376

contribution of asymptomatic hosts to disease transmission a delayed onset of symptoms,

377

whereby pre-symptomatic (infective) individuals could still contribute to its spread. We found

378

that the high frequency (weekly) random screening is the most effective non-pharmaceutical

379

control strategy to mitigate and even prevent an outbreak, when coupled with an additional risk

380

mitigation measure (e.g., facial mask) in classrooms, dorms, and social activities. Since random

381

screening testing allows for the successful and early detection of both asymptomatic and

382

symptomatic individuals, it successfully reduces the transmission rate such that the maximum

383

quarantine capacity is far lower than expected to further reduce the economic burden caused

384

from quarantine.

385

We also conducted a simple analysis on vaccination assuming 50% and 80% of the student body

386

immunized with 95% vaccine efficacy. In most cases, it sufficed to prevent an outbreak or

387

significantly mitigate its size. In highly transmissive environments, efficient

388

environmental/behavioral control measures (i.e., wearing facial masks in class, dorms, or at
19

389

social events) are required to mitigate disease spread even with a 80% vaccination coverage. But

390

the frequency of random test screening could be highly reduced or replaced with symptomatic

391

screening only (Figure 10).

392

Our results should be robust for colleges/universities with a smaller student body (See Figures

393

S3-S8 in SI). The proposed individual-based modeling framework can be readily applicable to

394

other aerosol or airborne infectious diseases like COVID-19. Indeed, the social mixing

395

component of the system is independent of disease progress. The potential to generate and

396

simulate synthetic college communities can be employed with robust predictions. Moreover, our

397

methodology can be extended to other local community settings such as workplaces, primary and

398

secondary schools, or hospitals.

399

Many additional topics could be explored by our IBM methodology, including consistent

400

procedures to assess risk factors and relative contributions of different transmission

401

environments and social mixing patterns on disease outbreak. Such assessment could guide

402

effective intervention strategies. Our social mixing setup (scheduled and random) could be

403

further expanded to account for more realistic intermediate levels of social connectivity. This

404

work could also be extended to account for partial or dynamic vaccine schedules. Besides, since

405

college campuses are often not isolated, we could extend current model to couple college campus

406

transmission to the local community.

407

Conclusions

408

Our analysis has implications for college reopening and in-person activities, planned in the near

409

future. The risk of COVID-19 outbreak could be efficiently controlled or mitigated using

410

existing control measures. Without vaccine, the high frequency (weekly) random screening

411

appears the most effective control strategy, that would allow to mitigate and even prevent an

412

outbreak on college campuses, coupled with some environmental/behavioral control (e.g., facial

413

mask in class, dorm, and social events). Our analysis of vaccination shows that some level of

414

herd immunity could be attained at 50% -80% vaccine coverage. Below herd immunity level,

415

additional environmental/behavioral control measures are essential, but random screening is less

416

important and could be reduced or lifted.

Figures

Figure 1: An abstract flowchart of social mixing and disease progress. Social mixing is
implemented in our IBM via contact pools where students aggregate on a daily basis. Two types
of contacts are considered: Scheduled (class and dorm mixing) and random (dining and/or other
random social mixing). The infection stages are classified as susceptible (S), infected (I), and
recovered (R) stages.

Figure 4: We consider three different levels of environmental risk (low, medium, and high) for
three environments (class, dorm, and social mixing) and two choices of social mixing sizes
(MCR=3 and MCR=6) to run our college IBM for a 16-week semester. LC, MC, and HC
represent low, medium, and high risk factors for class; LD, MD, and HD represent small,
medium, and high risk factors for dorms; LS, MS, and HS represent small, medium, and high
risk factors for social activity. The output is split into triples, so we have 27 combinations of
parameter choices for each panel. 100 realizations were run for each case and the light shaded
region indicated the quantiles of the distribution of the median. Panel (A): random social mixing:
mean contact rate (MCR)=3. Panel (B): MCR=6 case.

Figure 5: Predicted outbreak size distribution obtained by removing specific transmission
environments: panel (A) no classroom transmission; Panel (B) no dorm transmission. Panel (C)
and (D) no random social mixing. Mean contact rate for random social mixing in all cases is
MCR=6.

Figure 6: The effect of symptomatic quarantine on relative outbreak size and maximum
quarantine capacity (for college size 6000). We assume an infected individual from a
symptomatic pool would exhibit symptoms after day 7, based on our time-dependent infectivity
pattern (Figure 2). A random fraction of those (70%) are quarantined and don’t contribute to
transmission. Once recovered they are released into the normal (class-dorm-social) setting.

Figure 7: Combined control interventions of class-size, dorm-occupancy, and social mixing
pools on outbreak size. We selected five typical reference cases: MMM (the first letter represents
the risk level for class, followed by dorm and social), LMH, MHL, HLM, and HHH. For
example, LMH means low risk factor for class, moderate risk factor for dorm, and high risk
factor for social activity. We explored the 8 different choices of class, dorm, and social size
regulation.

Figure 8: The effect of different combinations of class, dorm, and social control on maximum
quarantine. We selected five typical cases as our baseline cases: MMM, LMH, MHL, HLM, and
HHH, using the same setting as in Figure 7. We explored the 8 different choices of class, dorm,
and social size regulation.

Figure 9: The effect of two different screening and test regulations on outbreak size and
maximum quarantine capacity: random screening 100% of the population every two week and
random screening 100% of population every week. We selected five typical cases as our baseline
cases: MMM, LMH, MHL, HLM, and HHH, using the same setting as in Figure 7.

Figure 10: The effect of two vaccine scenarios and five different screening-and-test regulations
on outbreak size and maximum quarantine capacity. Panel (A): 50% vaccinated with 95%
efficacy; Panel (B): 80% vaccinated with 95% efficacy. For each vaccine scenario, we explore
five different screening-and-test regulations: 1. no random screening (70% symptomatic
quarantine); 2. random screening every eight week + 70% symptomatic quarantine; 3. random
screening every four week + 70% symptomatic quarantine; 4. random screening every two week
+ 70% symptomatic quarantine; 5. random screening every week + 70% symptomatic
quarantine; We selected five typical cases as our baseline cases: MMM, LMH, MHL,HLM, and
HHH, using the same setting as in Figure 7.
