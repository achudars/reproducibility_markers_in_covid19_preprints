Abstract
Objectives: Numerous serologic immunoassays have been launched to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV2, including rapid tests. Here, we validate use of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) intended for rapid
screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole
blood, and compare results with ELISA. We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood
obtained from a capillary blood sample.
Methods: Samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary finger stick were obtained from patients
with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients negative for SARS-CoV-2. Samples were
tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) lateral flow immunoassay, and
antibody calls were compared with results obtained by ELISA.
Results: The Biolidics LFI kit shows clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 on venous blood. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant
difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00), except for
detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Finger stick whole blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93%
sensitivity for antibody detection.
Conclusions: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) is
comparable to ELISA and showed consistent results across different sample types. Furthermore, we show
that capillary blood obtained by finger stick shows similar sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid
testing in the community and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Background
The novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China in
December of 2019 [1]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, rapidly spread across the globe
and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 [2]. COVID19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with over 4 million confirmed cases and
284,536 deaths attributed to the disease as of May 11, 2020 [3]. In the United States alone, there are over
1 million confirmed cases and more than 80,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19 [4].
Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques performed with
nasopharyngeal samples are the mainstay for diagnosing acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, and multiple
molecular testing modalities are now available [5]. However, serologic testing to determine recent
infections and potential immunity remain limited. Serologic testing for IgM and IgG antibodies is a useful
adjunct for clinical decision making [6] and has important implications for public health and policy
decisions [7]. Serology is cost-efficient, fast, simple to perform, and does not require additional materials
such as nasopharyngeal swabs and viral transport media required for many PCR-based molecular testing
platforms, which have been scarce during the pandemic. With no available vaccine and limited treatment
options for COVID-19, the development and validation of rapid serologic testing is urgently required.
Serologic assessment provides valuable information on past exposure, although the protective effect of
anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies remains unknown.
As demands for laboratory testing have increased exponentially, commercial vendors are
developing in vitro diagnostics for detection of SARS-CoV2, and many are applying for and obtaining
emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [7]. In addition to
RT-PCR diagnostics, a wide range of serologic immunoassays have been developed, including rapid tests.
Early on in this pandemic, the FDA approached serologic testing with limited oversight and did not
require EUA, in contrast to requirements for molecular assays. Under the FDA Policy D, providers or
manufacturers of serologic tests had to notify the FDA about tests, but those tests were not subject to
review. This led to an increasing number of serologic assays listed under policy D, and rapid

implementation of tests in the field. However, highly variable sensitivity and specificity of these assays
for COVID-19 immunity quickly led to the recognition that regulatory oversight or robust internal
validation is required. Tests approved by the FDA under EUA must be verified before they are widely
used for clinical diagnosis and decision-making. In the absence of FDA approval, internal rigorous
validation of intended assays with establishing proper thresholds is necessary.
Herein, we describe clinical validation of a new lateral flow immunoassay (LFI) test intended for
rapid screening and qualitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG in serum, plasma, and whole
blood. We also sought to establish the value of LFI testing on capillary blood obtained from a finger stick
sample, since there are currently no FDA EUA approved assays for capillary blood. Plasma, serum, whole
blood, and capillary blood (finger stick) samples from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR were
tested with the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) (Biolidics Ltd.), and the results were
correlated with those obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the gold standard for
serologic detection of antibodies.

Materials and Methods
Study design
This retrospective study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of a commercially available lateral flow
immunoassay for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2. Samples from 62
patients used in this study were either discarded clinical samples collected for routine laboratory tests or
IRB approved research samples collected at NYU Langone Medical Center (S16-00122).

Blood samples
Whole blood, plasma, or serum samples collected by venous blood draw and capillary blood collected via
finger stick were used. Patients were defined as SARS-CoV-2 positive if RT-qPCR (cobas, Roche FDA
EUA) performed on nasopharyngeal samples was positive for SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Plasma and
venous whole blood samples were collected from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients on the day

of the initial positive nasopharyngeal PCR test (D0; n=24) or ≥7 days (D7; n=26) after the positive PCR
test (D7). For 11 patients, serum samples at two time points separated by 7 days were available (D0 and
D7). Plasma samples from hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 not detected in nasopharyngeal

(human

addition, plasma samples of presumably SARS-CoV-2 negative patients hospitalized in January-April of
2019 (pre-SARS-CoV-2 era) that were previously collected and stored at -80°C were used (n=20).
Samples collected for validation of capillary whole blood samples were obtained by finger stick from 14
patients who had recovered from COVID-19 at 18-46 days after positive SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-qPCR
testing.

Clinical SARS-CoV-2 testing
Nasopharyngeal samples were tested for clinical care using the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 molecular
diagnostic test (Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions per FDA approved EUA protocol.

Biolidics Lateral Flow Immunoassay
Venous plasma, serum, whole blood, or capillary (finger stick) blood was used for the 2019-nCoV
IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) (Biolidics Ltd., Singapore) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

provided dropper, and then 3 drops of diluent were added into the same sample well. Results were read
after 10 minutes by assessing visual color changes in the testing strip corresponding to IgM, IgG, and
control protein regions, and the image was electronically documented. Each test was reviewed by two
observers. The IgM or IgG band was called positive only if identified by both observers independently.

Any intensity of red color change in the IgM and IgG test regions, together or alone, was considered a
positive result (Figure 1). Plasma, serum, and whole blood samples were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgM and IgG antibodies at D0 or D7, and capillary finger stick samples were obtained more than 14 days
from both symptom onset (range, 19-61 days; median, 32 days) and PCR diagnosis (range, 18-46 days;
median, 30.5 days).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The MGH/Ragon COVID-19 IgG, IgA, and IgM ELISA, an in-house ELISA developed by Massachusetts
General Hospital (Boston, MA) and Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard (Cambridge, MA), was
performed on plasma and serum specimens for quantitative assessment of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies
that target SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Sequential specimens of 9 patients were
analyzed at two time points 7 days apart, and 6 additional specimens were analyzed at D0 (total D0,
n=15; total D7, n=9). In addition, 24 specimens negative for SARS-CoV-2 were assessed by ELISA.
Quantitation of antibodies was performed by interpolating O.D. values to a standard curve consisting of
an anti-SARS-CoV-1/2 monoclonal antibody (CR3022) in IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes. RBD and
CR3022-IgG were kindly produced and provided by Jared Feldman, Tim M. Caradonna, and Blake M.
Hauser from the laboratory of Dr. Aaron Schmidt (Ragon Institute). CR3022 reference sequences,
CR3022-IgA and CR3022-IgM isotypes, and ELISA protocols were kindly provided by Stephanie
Fischinger, Caroline Atyeo, and Matthew Slein from the laboratory of Dr. Galit Alter (Ragon Institute).
ELISA protocols were developed and optimized with the laboratory of Dr. Alejandro Balazs (Ragon
Institute). Automation was performed on a QUANTA-Lyser 3000 (Inova).

Statistical Analysis
To compare Biolidics and ELISA in detecting antibodies at D0 and D7, a pair-wise two-sample t-test was
conducted (Table 3E). Pair-wise two-sample t-test was also conducted to compare plasma and whole

blood samples with Biolidics (Table 4). Exact 95% confidence intervals (Clopper–Pearson Method for
Binomial Proportions) of percentage positivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were calculated in
patients with SARS-CoV-2 assessed by Biolidics (Table 1B) and in patients with SARS-CoV-2 assessed
by ELISA (Table 3C). The sensitivity of IgM and IgG detection with capillary samples in patients with
SARS-CoV-2 was also calculated (Table 4D). P-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. The calculations were performed using R software.

Results
Clinical Agreement: Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity
Results of a commercially available serologic LFI for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG
antibodies were evaluated using plasma and serum samples of 39 PCR-positive patients with SARS-CoV2 and negative control samples from 24 patients. Of the 39 PCR-positive patients, 13 patients were tested
by LFI on the day of PCR diagnosis (D0), 15 patients were tested at 7 days post PCR test (D7), and 11
patients were sequentially assessed at both D0 and D7 (Table 1A). Four negative control samples were
obtained in March 2020 from patients with negative nasopharyngeal PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and 20
negative control samples were archived samples of patients hospitalized in early 2019 before the emersion
of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2A).
To assess the sensitivity of LFI at various time points after initial diagnosis, plasma samples were
grouped by number of days since initial detection of SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal sample. D0
indicates that LFI was performed using plasma from the same day as the initial nasopharyngeal sample,
and D7 indicates that LFI was performed using plasma from approximately one week after the initial
nasopharyngeal sample was obtained. The sensitivity for detecting IgM, IgG, and IgM or IgG at D0 was
29%, 21%, and 29%, respectively (Table 1B). Sensitivity at D7 increased to 54% for IgM, 88% for IgG,
and 92% for IgM or IgG (Table 1B).
Of 24 negative plasma samples, 22 tested negative for IgM and IgG antibodies (92%) by LFI. Of
4 negative plasma samples obtained in March 2020, no IgM or IgG was detected (Table 2A).

Interestingly, of 20 plasma samples obtained from before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, 2 samples tested
positive for IgM, however no samples tested positive for IgG (Table 2A). The overall specificity of the
LFI was 92% for IgM, 100% for IgG, and 92% for IgM and IgG combined (Table 2B).
Eleven patients with SARS-CoV-2 were tested sequentially at D0 and D7. One patient was
positive for IgM and IgG antibodies at D0 and also at D7. Of the 10 patients who were negative for
antibodies at D0, 4 showed IgM antibodies at D7 and 8 showed IgG antibodies at D7 time point. Overall,
9 of 11 sequentially tested patients showed IgM and/or IgG antibodies at D7 by Biolidics LFI (Figure
2A).

Technical Agreement: Analytical Sensitivity and Specificity
Results of serologic LFI were correlated with results obtained by ELISA. ELISA was performed
with plasma or serum samples from 15 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected on nasopharyngeal swab and
24 negative control samples (Table 3A, 3B). Samples from 9 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were
sequentially assessed at both D0 and D7, and samples of 6 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were assessed at
D0 only.
Of the 6 patients with SARS-CoV-2 assessed at D0 only, all 6 were positive for IgM or IgG
antibodies by LFI and 5 were positive for IgM or IgG antibodies by ELISA (Table 3A). Samples of the 9
remaining PCR-positive patients were assessed at both D0 and D7. At D0, none of these samples were
positive for IgM or IgG antibodies by LFI or ELISA, showing perfect concordance (Table 3A). At D7, 8
of 9 samples (89%) were positive for IgM and/or IgG antibodies by both LFI and ELISA. Four samples
were negative for IgM by LFI on D7 and positive by ELISA. IgG at D7 showed perfect concordance
between LFI and ELISA (Table 3A). The overall sensitivity of ELISA for detecting IgM, IgG, and IgM or
IgG antibodies was 33% for all at D0 and 89% for all at D7 (Table 3C). LFI and ELISA were compared at
both D0 and D7 for detecting IgM, IgG, and IgM or IgG (Figure 2, Figure 3). There was no significant
difference between LFI and ELISA in any comparison except borderline significance for detecting IgM at
D7 (p = 0.04; Table 3E). Correlation of MGH ELISA and Biolidics LFI was analyzed to establish a 95%

confidence threshold indicating that at least 95% of positive results by Biolidics LFI correspond to
antibody concentration of at least the confidence threshold on ELISA (Figure 3, black dotted line). Our
data suggest that Biolidics LFI positivity can be used as a substitute for high level antibody levels by
ELISA.
Of 24 negative plasma samples tested by ELISA, 22 (92%) were negative for both IgM and IgG
antibodies by LFI, and 22 (92%) cases were negative for both IgM and IgG by ELISA. Two cases
demonstrated IgM positivity by LFI. Interestingly, 2 cases also demonstrated positivity for IgM by
ELISA. One case showed IgM by both ELISA and LFI, while 1 case each demonstrated IgM by LFI or by
ELISA (Table 3B).

Matrix Validation: Performance of Biolidics LFI using Venous Plasma and Whole Blood
Results of serologic LFI were compared using both D7 plasma and D7 venous whole blood samples from
22 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected on nasopharyngeal samples (Table 4A; Figure 4A, 4B). With D7
plasma samples, 21 of 22 patients (95%) tested positive for antibodies (IgM and/or IgG). The same 21
patients tested positive for antibodies using D7 venous whole blood, indicating no significant difference
between sample types for detecting IgM and IgG (p = 0.33, p = 1.00; Table 4B). Plasma and whole blood
results for IgM and IgG separately were equivalent with one exception. In one patient (P35), IgM and IgG
were both positive with D7 plasma, while IgM was negative and IgG was positive with D7 venous whole
blood (Table 4A).

Performance of Biolidics LFI using Capillary Samples in Patients with SARS-CoV-2
In 14 patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2, results of LFI with capillary (finger stick) samples were
assessed at least two weeks after PCR confirmation (range, 18-46 days; median, 30.5 days) and symptom
onset (range, 19-61 days; median, 32 days). Six patients tested positive for IgM, 12 tested positive for
IgG, and 13 tested positive for IgM or IgG, for corresponding sensitivities of 43%, 86%, and 93%,
respectively (Table 4C, 4D; Figure 4B). One patient was excluded from the sensitivity analysis due to

concurrent diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder (systemic lupus erythematosus). Interestingly, this
patient did not exhibit IgM or IgG antibodies on LFI.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly altered the landscape of clinical testing validation and regulatory
oversight. With limited FDA oversight of serologic testing and variability of assays, rigorous internal
validation has become paramount. This study validated the use of the commercially available 2019-nCoV
IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) (Biolidics Ltd.) for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG
antibodies using plasma and whole blood samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
Patient results were compared to those of negative control samples from hospitalized patients with
negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR results as well as control samples archived before the emergence of SARSCoV-2. We also sought to establish the sensitivity of the Biolidics test kit using capillary blood obtained
via a finger stick, as LFI tests have potential utility in community testing, point of care testing, or even
self-testing. Overall, we show that the Biolidics LFI kit has clinical sensitivity of 92% at 7 days after PCR
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. Results of the LFI are
similar to those obtained with gold standard ELISA testing, providing evidence that robust LFI tests can
have utility comparable to that of ELISA with additional benefits of easy testing and low cost. There was
no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p=1.00),
except for marginally significant detection of IgM at D7 (p=0.04). Nevertheless, IgM detection is more
prone to false positive results by both ELISA and LFI.
Results obtained from plasma and whole blood samples were compared and show reproducibility
between sample types, which removes the need for plasma or serum preparation. Furthermore, we show
that capillary whole blood obtained by finger stick shows comparable sensitivity for detecting anti-SARSCoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies as venous blood samples. This provides an opportunity for communitybased testing, rapid point of care testing, and potentially self-testing for the presence antibodies, similar to

glucose self-monitoring. While ELISA remains a gold standard for establishing the level of antibodies, we
show that strong correlation between LFI and ELISA can provide an estimate of antibody levels between
closely correlated clinical assays. This close correlation decreases the need for additional testing by
ELISA in settings where the financial cost of ELISA is a limiting factor prohibitive to broad serologic
screening.
Serology provides important complementary information to PCR testing that is useful to evaluate
the immunity status of a patient. Production of specific IgM antibodies is one of the body’s first lines of
defense against viruses; IgG antibodies are produced 1-2 weeks later and provide long-term immunity.
The presence of IgM antibodies can be used to indicate recent exposure, while IgG antibodies indicate
previous exposure and often portend immunity [6]. In our study, detection of IgM was less specific than
IgG detection by both Biolidics LFI and ELISA, and sensitivity for detection of IgM and IgG antibodies
increased substantially with time. The most sensitive LFI results were obtained when both IgM and IgG
were considered more than 7 days after PCR testing. Both LFI and ELISA at D7 showed positive IgM
and/or IgG results for 8 of 9 sequentially tested patients. One patient did not show IgM or IgG antibodies
on LFI or ELISA at D7; this patient previously underwent a solid organ transplant and was taking
immunosuppressant therapy (Figure 2). Taken together, our results indicate that IgM and IgG serologic
testing must be evaluated within the proper clinical context, and serial serologic assessment or follow-up
testing with a more sensitive method assay may be useful in some circumstances.
While RT-PCR remains the gold standard for acute diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, serologic tests
provide supplementary diagnostic information and are more practical for use in large-scale screening [79]. Molecular-based PCR testing requires skilled technicians, relatively invasive sample collection,
expensive technology, high complexity laboratories, and supplies that were in short supply due to high
global demand.

These molecular tests are useful for symptomatic patients who require triage and

treatment, but antibody detection may be more useful for population-wide screening protocols. ELISA,
the gold standard for antibody detection and quantification, requires trained technicians and relatively
complex laboratory procedures that are difficult to quickly scale. In contrast, rapid LFI antibody tests are

easy to use, require minimal training for performance and interpretation, are scalable for use in
population-wide screening protocols, and are not limited to a laboratory setting.
In our study, use of the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) did have important
limitations. First, detection of antibodies increased from 29% at D0 to 92% at D7, indicating that
sensitivity increased significantly with time. This is imperative to consider when implementing largescale screening protocols. Repeat testing may be necessary to determine patients who have developed
antibodies if they were first tested soon after exposure to the virus.

This is especially true for

asymptomatic carriers who never show symptoms but may still develop antibodies. Further large-scale
longitudinal studies are needed to determine the expected timeline of antibody development in SARSCoV-2. It is also imperative to determine whether long-term antibody production is maintained and
whether antibodies provide effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we identified two
patients in our capillary validation cohort who had similar symptoms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 at
the same time who lived in the same household. One patient had IgG detected by LFI over one month
from diagnosis, while the other household member was negative for both IgM and IgG antibodies (Figure
4C), indicating possible interpersonal variability in the kinetics of developing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Further studies are warranted to evaluate inter-individual variability in the timing and strength of antibody
response to the same strain of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal
Gold) identified IgM antibodies in 2 of 20 negative controls archived before the emergence of SARSCoV-2. However, ELISA cut-off values obtained from standard curves also detected IgM antibodies in 2
negative controls, resulting in the same specificity for IgM across Biolidics LFI and ELISA in this study.
Importantly, neither LFI nor ELISA identified IgG antibodies in negative control specimens, suggesting
that IgG is more accurate in identifying prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. IgM antibody results should be
interpreted in the proper clinical context, and repeated serology testing or immediate PCR testing to
exclude asymptomatic infection may be warranted with detection of IgM alone.

In summary, rapid serology allows an effective tracking method for asymptomatic carriers and
patients with mild disease who do not require sensitive molecular-based diagnosis to guide acute care.
Here, we validated the use of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold) and showed
consistent results across multiple sample types compared to ELISA. However, the large variability of LFI
tests requires that each test is either validated in-house or that proper FDA review and approval is
conducted. From an interpretational standpoint, internal validation is recommended as different LFI tests
may display different intensity of positive bands. Recording images and utilization of image software or
artificial intelligence based interpretation of the results may also decrease inter-observer variability,
which is particularly important in the setting of population-wide self-testing. Large-scale population
based antibody screening with validated testing platforms will provide additional understanding of the
human to human transmission rate, prevalence, incidence, and mortality of SARS-CoV-2, which remain
largely uncertain in the rapidly evolving global landscape. Independently validated serology tests will be
integral to obtaining this information.

Figures
Figure 1. Visual interpretation of 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit (Colloidal Gold). Any intensity of
red color change in the IgM and IgG test regions is considered a positive result. Plasma results: A. IgM
(+) IgG (-), B. IgM (+) IgG (-), C. IgM (+) IgG (+), D. IgM (-) IgG (+), E. IgM (+) IgG (+), F. IgM (-)
IgG (-). Capillary blood results: G. IgM (+) IgG (+), H. IgM (-) IgG (+), I. IgM (-) IgG (+), J. IgM (-) IgG
(-).
Figure 2. Sequential Antibody Detection. A. Samples of 11 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were tested by
Biolidics at both D0 and D7 for the presence of IgM and IgG. Samples of 9 patients with SARS-CoV-2
were assessed by ELISA at D0 and D7 for the presence of IgM (B) and IgG (C). Dotted line represents
ELISA concentration threshold of positivity (0.3 U/mL for IgM, 0.2 U/mL for IgG). * ELISA results not
available for P10 and P24. §P19 was taking immunosuppressant therapy.
Figure 3. A. Comparison of Biolidics results and ELISA concentration in samples of patients from the
pre-COVID19 era, patients with COVID19 tested at D0, and patients with COVID19 tested at D7. (A)
IgM and (B) IgG. Red dotted line represents corresponding cut-off values based on ELISA standard
curve, 0.3 U/mL for IgM and 0.2 U/mL for IgG. Black dotted line represents the 95% confidence
threshold, such that 95% of results that are positive result by Biolidics have an antibody concentration by
ELISA higher than or equal to the established threshold.
