Abstract
Background:
Antigen-based point of care tests for identification of SARS-CoV-2 may markedly enhance
effectiveness of population-based controlling strategies. Previous studies have demonstrated
acceptable sensitivity and high specificity compared to RT-qPCR in symptomatic individuals,
but test performance for asymptomatic individuals is unknown.
Methods:
Test performance of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) was compared to RTqPCR in a longitudinal cohort study of asymptomatic football players and staff members of
professional football clubs. Based on timing of symptoms and prior and subsequent test
results, positive RT-qPCR tests were categorized as pre-symptomatic, early or late infection
or persistent RNA shedding.
Findings:
2425 tests were performed in 824 individuals, of which 52 (6.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive
based on RT-qPCR. There were 2406 paired sets from asymptomatic subjects for analysis.
Sixteen Panbio™ tests were inconclusive, for which sensitivity analyses were performed
(considering results as either positive or negative or being excluded). Sensitivity of Panbio™
ranged from 61.76% (95% CI 49.2-73.3) to 69.12% (95% CI: 56.7-79.8) and specificity from
99.53% (95% CI: 99.2-99.8) to 100% (95% CI: 99.8-100). Sensitivity of Panbio™ to detect
subjects with pre-symptomatic/early infection (n= 42) ranged from 81.82% (95% CI: 67.3-91.8)
to 90.91% (95% CI: 78.3-97.5) with specificity always above 99%.
Interpretation:
In asymptomatic subjects the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had sensitivity of 81.82% to
90.91% and specificity above 99% for identifying pre-symptomatic and early SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Funding:
This study was funded by the executing institutes. The Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Tests
were provided by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS).

Introduction
Rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent contact tracing are essential in the
containment of the current pandemic [1]. In most countries testing is targeted towards
individuals with symptoms of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, infectiousness most
likely occurs before symptom onset and some infections remain asymptomatic [2]. Screening
of asymptomatic individuals may therefore also identify infectious individuals.
Currently, reverse transcriptase real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the
standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a validation study of the Abbott Panbio TM
COVID-19 Ag rapid test in community-dwelling subjects with symptoms of respiratory tract
infection, this assay had specificity of 100%, and sensitivity above 95% to detect SARS-CoV2 infected subjects with low Ct-values in RT-qPCR (i.e. infections with a high viral load in
nasopharyngeal samples) [3]. Considering the short turnaround time, user friendliness, low
cost, and opportunity for decentralized testing, lateral flow assays (LFA) would also be a
suitable test for screening of asymptomatic individuals.
We, therefore, validated the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test in a cohort of asymptomatic
football players and staff of football clubs from the Dutch national leagues who are
longitudinally tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection with RT-qPCR at approximately weekly
intervals.

Materials and methods
Populations and Study Period
The study population consisted of football players, staff and referees from 13 different
professional football clubs and the national teams in the Netherlands. Starting August 2020,
the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB) required all individuals to be tested for
SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR independent of presence of symptoms, 2 days prior to
each match. The study period of the LFA validation ran from 1 st of October, 2020 to 9 th of
November 2020. All individuals were sampled for routine RT-qPCR testing, using a
throat/nasopharyngeal swab, and underwent an additional nasopharyngeal swab for LFA
testing. At two test visits for two different teams (n= 104 tests) only LFA tests were performed,
followed by sampling for RT-qPCR on the following day. Data regarding symptoms of potential
SARS-CoV-2 infection before and during the study period and (prior) test results were collected
by the physicians of each of the football clubs.
Diagnostic tests
RT-qPCR
The samples were tested with RT-qPCR by either Eurofins (Brugge, Belgium), Synlab
Laboratories (Luik, Belgium), or U-diagnostics (Utrecht, the Netherlands). RT-qPCR results
were obtained from the physicians of the participating football clubs and positive or discrepant
results were verified. Residual material of these samples was not available for further analyses
or repeated testing on a single platform.

LFA:
The Panbio TM COVID-19 Ag rapid test device by Abbott (Lake Country, IL, U.S.A) is a
membrane-based immunochromatography assay which detects the nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples. Collected swabs were transferred into dedicated
sample collection tubes containing a lysis buffer provided with the test kit. Samples were
processed on site, directly after collection, by trained personnel wearing personal protective
equipment and in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Test results were reco rded
after 15 minutes of assay initiation and documented by photograph.
Analysis
Specificity and sensitivity with 95% confidence intervals of the LFA were calculated using the
RT-qPCR results as reference test. The RT-qPCR results were categorized into different
phases of infection. Presymptomatic infection was defined as a first positive test before onset
of symptoms. Early infection includes the first positive test for individuals with asymptomatic
infection (and therefore not identified as presymptomatic) and all positive test results within 7
days of the first positive test. Late infection was defined as a positive test at least 7 days after
the first positive RT-qPCR result or at least 7 days after onset of symptoms with relief of
symptoms for more than 24 hours. Persistent RNA shedding was defined as a positive test
more than four weeks after the first positive RT-qPCR result and not suspected for re-infection
based on absence of symptoms and high Ct values (>32). The LFA results were analysed for
these different phases. Specificity and sensitivity were determined based on presymptomatic/
early infection versus late infection/ no infection. Since RT-qPCR was performed in different
laboratories and using different assays, Ct values cannot directly be compared. Therefore no
sensitivity analyses based on Ct values were performed.
Ethical Approval
The medical research ethics committee (MREC) of Utrecht decided the study is not subject to
the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) and did not require full review by
an accredited MREC. All participants have provided written informed consent.
Role of the funding source
This study was investigator initiated. No external funding was received.
Results
Population Characteristics
Our cohort included 824 individuals (94% male) with a median age of 27 years (range 16 to 80
years, IQR: 21-40). Overall, 2425 samples were tested by RT-qPCR and LFA. Of these, 2321
tests were obtained at the same time, and 104 tests were taken with a one day interval between
LFA and PCR. The median number of LFA tests per subject was 3 (range 1-6, IQR: 1-4).
Based on RT-qPCR, 52 of 824 subjects tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least once during
the study period (prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection: 6.3%). Of these 52, 29 developed
(mostly mild) symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection; coryza (n=12), sore throat (n=12), fever
(n=12), headache (n=6), muscle ache (n=5), cough (n=5), altered smell or taste (n=5). A n
asymptomatic infection occurred in 23 individuals (44%; prevalence of asymptomatic SARSCoV-2 infection: 2.8%).
Of the 2425 tests, 18 were performed while the individual reported symptoms at time of testing;
either at time of the first positive test (n=13) or during a follow-up after a prior positive test

(n=5). These 18 tests were not included for analysis. One LFA test was invalid du e to absence
of a control band and was excluded for analysis. The comparison between RT-qPCR and LFA,
therefore, includes 2406 paired tests.
LFA results
Of 2406 tests, 68 (2.8%) were positive by RT-qPCR and 42 (1.7%) by LFA (Table 1). Sixteen
LFA tests (0.67%) were considered inconclusive because of weak unclear bands, of which 5
were positive with RT-qPCR. We, therefore, determined sensitivity of LFA by either excluding
them from analysis, or by considering them as positive or negative to determine best case and
worst case scenarios. Sensitivity of LFA ranged from 69.12% (95% CI: 56.7-79.8) with
inconclusive test results considered positive to 61.76% (95% CI: 49.2-73.3) with inconclusive
test results considered negative. Specificity of LFA was 99.53% (95% CI: 99.2-99.8) with
inconclusive test results considered positive and 100% (95% CI: 99.8-100) with inconclusive
test results considered negative or excluded.

Discrepancy analysis
False positive LFA results were not observed. Eleven LFA tests, obtained from 11 individuals
at distinct test visits, were considered inconclusive and were tested negative with RT-qPCR.
Follow-up tests confirmed the negative RT-qPCR test result.
False negative LFA results were observed for four individuals with presymptomatic or early
infection. Two of them had Ct values of 27 and 29, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed
in a subsequent test. In one of these subjects there was a sampling delay of one day between
LFA and subsequent RT-qPCR. The other two false-negative tests occurred in asymptomatic
individuals with a single positive RT-qPCR test with Ct values of 32 and negative RT-qPCR
tests in the preceding and following week.
Most false negative LFA tests (17/21) occurred in subjects with late infection or persistent RNA
shedding. All samples had Ct values above 27 (median Ct value 32 (IQR: 30-36)) and were
obtained a median of 15 days (IQR: 10-18) after the first positive test. Compared to the false
negative LFA tests during late infection, samples with a positive LFA result (6/21) had lower
Ct values (median 27 (IQR: 22-28)) and were obtained a median of 10 days (IQR: 7-11) after
the first positive test.
Discussion
The PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test reliably identified SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects in a
cohort of asymptomatic individuals, with a specificity above 99% and an overall sensitivity of

69.12%. False negative LFA results were mostly observed in a late phase of infection (on
average 2 weeks after the first positive test) with low viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs. The
estimated sensitivity of LFA in presymptomatic and early infections was between 81.82% and
90.91%.
Although our cohort is not a representative sample from the general population, as it
constitutes predominantly males who are often young pr ofessional athletes, our results are in
line with previous reports of this LFA. In our previous validation in an ambulant symptomatic
population, overall sensitivity was 72.6% but increased to 95.2% when using a Ct-value of 32
as cut-off [3]. In a Spanish cohort of 1369 individuals an overall sensitivity of 71.4% was
reported, which increased for symptomatic patients who presented within 5 days since
symptom onset (83.1%), and for those with high viral load (87.7%) [4]. Another Spanish study
retrospectively analysing frozen swabs reported a sensitivity of 79.5% among asymptomatic
individuals and also observed an association with Ct-value (Ct-value <25 100%, Ct value <30
98.6%) [5].
For our analysis, three different laboratories performed the RT-qPCR analyses, limiting the
possibility for overall analyses using Ct-values as a cut-off. The unique longitudinal prospective
screening of this cohort enables us to distinguish different phases of infection. Th e PanbioTM
COVID-19 Ag rapid test identified 11 of 12 presymptomatic infections and 29 of 32 early
infections. In a longitudinal cohort of basketball players and staff, asymptomatic individuals
rapidly progressed from a negative test to a peak Ct-value, as demonstrated by repeated
testing [6], which could explain the good performance of this LFA during early infection.
Sensitivity of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test decreased substantially during late infection
(i.e. more than one week after the first positive test).
The PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test did not detect 14 of 21 late infections. Although samples
were tested on different platforms limiting comparisons, all these samples had high Ct values.
The risk of transmission is considered to be low or absent during late infection and will only
further decrease in following days. Therefore, isolation of these individuals at that time most
likely has limited effects from a public health perspective. This is supported by an analysis of
LFA, RT-qPCR and virus culture, in which the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test detected
97.3% of samples with positive cultures, reflecting infectious individuals [7].
Furthermore, modelling studies have demonstrated that surveillance effectiveness depends
largely on frequency of testing and speed of reporting, rather than test sensitivity [8, 9]. The
current study also demonstrates the feasibility of performing the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid
test as point of care test, outside of a laboratory setting, by trained personnel with appropriate
infection prevention control measures and use of personal protective equipment. Results were
immediately reported to the physician of the football club, allowing direct intervention in case
of positive LFA test results.
We observed inconclusive results in 0.66% of LFA tests. Yet, in five of these 16 inconclusive
results SARS-CoV-2 appeared detectable with RT-qPCR. We, therefore, recommend
additional sampling for RT-qPCR in case of inconclusive LFA results.
In conclusion, the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag rapid test reliably identifies (early) SARS-CoV-2
infections in asymptomatic individuals, and can be used in targeted screening strategies for
early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals.
