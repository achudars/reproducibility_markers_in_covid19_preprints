Abstract

25

Background: COVID-19 is a novel disease that has spread to nearly every country worldwide.

26

Medical laboratory professionals are key in the fight against COVID-19 as they provide

27

confirmatory diagnosis which is the main basis upon which cases are identified and clinical

28

management instituted. Lack of knowledge, poor attitude and unsafe laboratory practices could

29

have negative implications towards the control of COVID-19. We conducted a quick online

30

questionnaire to investigate the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical laboratory

31

personnel regarding COVID-19 in Zambia.

32

Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study among medical laboratory professionals in

33

Zambia from 10th to 29th June, 2020. Data were collected using google forms and exported to

34

SPSS version 23 for statistical analysis. Independent predictors of COVID-19 knowledge and

35

practices were determined. Adjusted odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals are reported.

36

Results: A total of 208 medical laboratory professionals participated in the study. There were

37

more males (58.2%) than females. The majority of respondents had good knowledge (84.1%)

38

and practice (75%) regarding COVID-19. Less than half (n=97, 46.6%) reported willingness to

39

participate in a vaccination program. Predictors of good knowledge included; having a Bachelors

40

degree (AOR: 5.0, CI: 1.15-23.9) and having prior COVID-19 related training (AOR: 8.83, CI:

41

2.03-38.4). Predictors of good practice included; having a masters or PhD qualification (AOR:

42

5.23, CI: 1.15-23.9) and having prior COVID-19 related training (AOR: 14.01, CI: 6.47-30.4).

43

Conclusion: Our findings revealed that medical laboratory professionals in Zambia have good

44

knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19. However poor practices were observed

45

There is need for continuous professional development (CPD) to ensure that medical laboratory

46

professionals are well informed and aware of best practices to aid in curbing the pandemic.

47

Key words: COVID-19, medical laboratory professions, knowledge, attitude, practice

Introduction

51

Corona virus Disease also referred to as COVID-19 is a respiratory tract disease caused by

52

SARS-CoV-2 virus [1]. Coronaviruses have been known to affect humans, infecting the

53

respiratory tract and infections ranging from mild to severe [2]. In the past, coronaviruses have

54

caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome

55

(MERS), caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Research has shown that

56

COVID-19 is more contagious compared to the previous outbreaks, but less lethal [3]. Coughing

57

and sneezing facilitates viral excretion and thus transmission. Inhaling these droplets or contact

58

with infected surfaces then increases the risk of infection. There is no known vaccine or

59

documented specific treatment for COVID 19 disease [4]. Drugs that show potential to treat

60

critically ill patients, are still being investigated for Safety and efficacy [4â€“6]. Prevention and

61

controlling the spread of COVID-19 is done by social distancing, wearing face masks to protect

62

one from inhaling infectious droplets as well as effective hand hygiene by regularly washing

63

hands or use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers [7,8].

64

The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province,

65

Central China. Since then, the disease has spread to nearly every country worldwide leading to

66

the World Health Organization declaring COVID-19 a pandemic on 11th March, 2020 [9]. As of

67

17th September, 2020 there were 29 611 395 confirmed cases and 935 767 deaths reported

68

globally [10]. In Zambia 13 887 confirmed cases with 326 deaths were reported as at 17th

69

September, 2020 [11].

70

Few publications and national situation reports exist that detail the number of Healthcare

71

workers including medical laboratory personnel around the world infected with COVID-19 [12].

72

In China where the Disease first started 2055 healthcare workers were infected as of 24th March

73

2020 [13]. In the United states of America, 9282 health care workers were infected as of 14th

74

April 2020 [14]. The World Health Organisation estimates that over 1000 health workers in

75

Africa had been infected with COVID-19 by 23rd July, 2020 [15]. Information on the source of

76

infection among healthcare workers in countries that have recorded the disease remains limited.

77

Medical laboratory professionals are key personnel in the diagnosis of COVID 19 in Zambia.

78

Although they are not in the frontline which precludes them from prominence, their role in

79

providing confirmatory diagnosis is the main basis upon which cases are identified and clinical

80

management instituted. The work areas of Biomedical laboratory professionals are very

81

hazardous due to both suspected and unsuspected infectious agents. Lack of knowledge, good

82

attitude and poor laboratory practices can have a twofold effect- a wrong diagnosis leading to

83

wrong patient management with severe consequences or safety incidents which could be

84

deleterious to both the concerned staff and their immediate environment which includes

85

coworkers, families and patients or laboratory clients [16].

86

We conducted a study to understand the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of medical

87

laboratory professionals in Zambia.

Methods

92

Ethical consideration

93

Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the Tropical Diseases Research Centre

94

institutional review board (IRB registration number: 00002911). The questionnaire contained an

95

information sheet regarding the study and an informed consent statement for participants to agree

96

to participate or not. All participants who declined to take part in the study were immediately

97

withdrawn and could not proceed to respond to the questionnaire.

98

Study design

99

This cross sectional survey was conducted among 208 medical laboratory professionals in

100

Zambia. Due to COVID 19 related restrictions imposed in this period, it was not feasible to

101

conduct face to face interviews and therefore we administered an online questionnaire using

102

google forms. To ensure that only target respondents participated in the survey we distributed the

103

link to the survey through the email database and WhatsApp group facilitated by the Biomedical

104

Society of Zambia.

105

Data collection

106

Pretesting of the questionnaire was done by administering the questionnaire to faculty at the

107

Copperbelt University to ensure consistency and reliability of the questions and expected

108

responses. The results from the pilot study were not included in the final analysis. The

109

questionnaire had two main components: demographics and KAP. The demographic section had

110

8 questions while the KAP section was divided into the following subsections; knowledge (10

111

questions), attitude (5 questions) and practices (13 questions).

112

Data management and statistical analysis

113

Collected data were downloaded and cleaned in Microsoft excel and exported to SPSS version

114

23 for statistical analysis. The statistical significance was set at p<0.05. To ensure the internal

115

consistency and reliability of the data we used Cronbach alpha coefficient according to methods

116

described [17]. To identify factors of good knowledge and practice against COVID-19, bivariate

117

analysis was performed. All factors that were statistically significant in bivariate logistic

regression were included in forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression model to identify

119

factors that were independently associated with good knowledge and practice.

Demographic characteristics

122

A total of 208 medical laboratory professionals from seven provinces of Zambia took part in this

123

study. There were more males (n=121, 58.2%) compared to females. Half of the participants

124

were aged 20-29 years and had a Diploma in Biomedical Science qualification. Most of the

125

respondents were from a hospital laboratory (n=134, 64.4%) (Table 1).

Factors associated to COVID-19 knowledge

129

A high proportion of respondents were knowledgeable on COVID-19 (n=175, 84.1%). Bivariate

130

logistic regression analysis showed that current qualification (Crude OR:4.68, CI:1.07-20.44)

131

and COVID-19 training (Crude OR:8.72, CI: 2.02-37.65) among participants were significantly

132

associated with COVID-19 knowledge. Therefore, participants with higher academic

133

qualifications and COVID-19 training were 4.68 and 8.72 times likely to have good COVID-19

134

knowledge respectively (Table 2).

Practice towards COVID-19 by medical laboratory personnel

143

Poor practices towards COVID-19 were recorded among three quarters of the participants.

144

Current qualification (Crude OR:4.51, CI:1.30-15.70), type of laboratory facility (Crude

145

OR:3.09, CI:1.01-9.45) and COVID-19 training (Crude OR:12.97, CI:6.19-27.18) were

146

significantly associated with good COVID-19 practices. Participants with higher academic

147

qualifications and those with prior COVID-19 training were 4.51 and 12.97 times likely to have

Attitude towards COVID-19 among medical laboratory personnel

155

About 93.8% reported that they would accept isolation from the community if diagnosed with

156

COVID-19. A few (46.6%) would accept to be vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine was

157

available. On the other hand, many participants (97.6%) were ready to take part in anti-epidemic

158

community activities. Our study revealed that 77.9% were confident that Zambia could win the

159

battle against the COVID-19 virus (Table 4).

Discussion

186

Very few studies worldwide have documented KAPs among HCWs towards COVID-19 due to

187

the novel nature of the disease [18]. Our study findings showed that majority of medical

188

laboratory professionals in Zambia had good knowledge towards COVID-19. This is comparable

189

to findings in Vietnam and Uganda [18,19]. The majority of medical laboratory professionals

190

had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 which is similar to findings in Vietnam [19] but

191

contrary to other findings among healthcare workers [18,20]. The level of knowledge on

192

COVID-19 among participants was similar irrespective of their gender, age and laboratory

193

facility. These finding are encouraging as they indicate that laboratory professionals are

194

knowledgeable on the transmission dynamics of the disease especially as they work with highly

195

infectious agents. Majority of participants exhibited poor practices towards COVID-19 contrary

196

to findings from Uganda and Nepal [18,21]. Most participants with poor practices were those

197

who had certificate qualifications, those without prior COVID-19 training and those from clinic

198

and health center laboratories. This could be attributed to limited resources, health information

199

and laboratory materials in most clinic and health center laboratories found in rural areas. Poor

200

practices can lead to delayed and/or wrong laboratory diagnosis leading to poor patient

201

management or safety incidents that could harm the personnel and their immediate coworkers,

202

families and patients or laboratory clients [22].

203

Current qualification and COVID-19 training among participants were significantly associated

204

with good COVID-19 knowledge, a finding similar to that obtained by a study in Vietnam [19],

205

but contrary to Bhagavathula and others [20]. Our findings show that participants with higher

206

academic qualifications and COVID-19 training were 4.68 and 8.72 times respectively to have

207

good COVID-19 knowledge. Current qualification was also significantly associated with good

208

COVID-19 practices which agrees with study findings from Uganda [18]. On the other hand,

209

type of laboratory facility and COVID-19 training were significantly associated with good

210

COVID-19 practices. This shows that participants who had received COVID-19 training were

211

12.97 times likely to have good COVID-19 practices and general infection prevention. This is in

212

agreement with a similar study in Nepal and Ethiopia [21,23].

Limitations

216

The study may be susceptible to self- presentation bias as it was based on an online administered

217

questionnaire.

219

Conclusion

220

Our study found that medical laboratory professionals in Zambia have good knowledge and

221

positive attitude towards COVID-19. In contrast, poor practices towards COVID-19 was found.

222

Current qualification and COVID-19 training were independently associated with COVID-19

223

knowledge and practice.

224

there is need for continuous professional development (CPD) among medical laboratory

225

personnel as a key intervention in improving their contribution to COVID-19 control efforts.
