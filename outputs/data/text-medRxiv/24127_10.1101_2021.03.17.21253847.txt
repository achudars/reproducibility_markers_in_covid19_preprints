Abstract
Background: Little is known about the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 antigen burden in
respiratory samples in different patient populations at different stages of infection.
Current rapid antigen tests cannot quantitate and track antigen dynamics with high
sensitivity and specificity in respiratory samples. Methods: We developed and validated
an ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with smartphone readout using the
Microbubbling Digital Assay previously developed by our group, which is a platform that
enables highly sensitive detection and quantitation of protein biomarkers. A computer
vision-based algorithm was developed for microbubble smartphone image recognition
and quantitation. A machine learning-based classifier was developed to classify the
smartphone images based on detected microbubbles. Using this assay, we tracked
antigen dynamics in serial swab samples from COVID patients hospitalized in ICU and
immunocompromised COVID patients. Results: The limit of detection (LOD) of the
Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay was 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fM) recombinant
nucleocapsid (N) antigen or 4000 copies/mL inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in
nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs, comparable to many rRT-PCR methods. The assay had
high analytical specificity towards SARS-CoV-2. Compared to EUA-approved rRT-PCR
methods, the Microbubbling Antigen Assay demonstrated a positive percent agreement
(PPA) of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 92-99%) in symptomatic individuals within
7 days of symptom onset and positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results, and a negative
percent agreement (NPA) of 97% (95% CI, 94-100%) in symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals with negative nucleic acid results. Antigen positivity rate in NP swabs
gradually decreased as days-after-symptom-onset increased, despite persistent nucleic

acid positivity of the same samples. The computer vision and machine learning-based
automatic microbubble image classifier could accurately identify positives and
negatives, based on microbubble counts and sizes. Total microbubble volume, a
potential marker of antigen burden, correlated inversely with Ct values and days-aftersymptom-onset. Antigen was detected for longer periods of time in
immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies, compared to
immunocompetent individuals. Simultaneous detectable antigens and nucleic acids may
indicate the presence of replicating viruses in patients with persistent infections.
Conclusions: The Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay enables sensitive and
specific detection of acute infections, and quantitation and tracking of antigen dynamics
in different patient populations at various stages of infection. With smartphone
compatibility and automated image processing, the assay is well-positioned to be
adapted for point-of-care diagnosis and to explore the clinical implications of antigen
dynamics in future studies.

Introduction
A significant challenge in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is to develop sensitive,
specific and easily accessible diagnostics to identify infections early, and to monitor
infection progress in order to implement appropriate isolation and infection control
procedures. Current diagnostic gold standard is real-time reverse
transcription−polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), with various methods
demonstrating limit of detection (LOD) from 102 to 105 copies/mL according to
manufacturer package inserts and reference panels 1-3. While many nucleic acid-based
methods are sensitive enough to detect acute infections, persistent nucleic acid
positivity after symptom resolution and disease recovery makes it challenging to
determine the right level of infection control measures during patient care 4. Several
lateral flow antigen assays have received FDA EUA approval. Due to the limit in
analytical sensitivity, these tests generate more false negatives compared to nucleic
acid tests, leading to concerns of missing acute infections 5. Furthermore, little is known
regarding how antigen burden changes during the various stages of SARS-CoV-2
infection, and how this correlates with nucleic acid burden and infectivity in different
patient populations. Therefore, highly sensitive, specific and convenient diagnostic
methods that can detect acute infections, quantitate and track antigen dynamics during
the disease course are highly desirable. In this study, we developed and validated a
highly sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay using smartphone readout,
with computer vision image recognition and machine learning (ML) classification, for
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection detection, antigen burden quantitation and tracking.

Nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most abundantly expressed proteins
during the replication of SARS-CoV-2, and is evolutionally conservative with a low
chance of mutations, and therefore widely used as the detection target in SARS-CoV-2
antigen assays.6 In order to detect acute infections at or before symptom onset, the key
challenge is to have an assay sensitive enough to detect the very low concentrations of
N in the early phase of infection. In this study, we use the Microbubbling Digital Assay
previously developed by our group 7 to achieve high sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 antigen
detection. In this technology, individual sandwich complexes formed between magnetic
bead/target/PtNP are distributed in microwells in a microchip. Images of oxygen
microbubbles generated through PtNP catalysis of H 2O2 breakdown are captured using
a smartphone camera as the detection method 7. We have previously shown that the
Microbubbling Digital Assay can detect and quantitate prostate specific antigen (PSA)
and beta human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) with high analytical sensitivity (limit of
detection (LOD) of 2.1 fM for PSA and 0.034 mIU/mL for βhCG, several hundred folder
higher sensitivity than current clinical methods) 7. We hereby take advantage of the
features of the Microbubbling Digital Assay with directly visible signals, femtomolar
analytical sensitivity, digital quantitation capability and compatibility with smartphone
and artificial intelligence7, apply it to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen, and
assess its performance in clinical swab samples. Using this assay, we tracked antigen
dynamics in an ICU COVID inpatient population and an immunocompromised COVID
patient population.

To repurpose the technology for the detection of the very low concentrations of
SARS-CoV-2 N antigen during acute infections, we have designed the Microbubbling
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay as show in Figure 1. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, the same
sample used in rRT-PCR methods, is eluted into saline or viral transport media, and
treated with lysis buffer to release the N protein from the viruses. The released N
protein is then detected using the Microbubbling assay, in which a monoclonal capture
antibody is conjugated to the surface of magnetic microbeads, and a polyclonal
detection antibody is biotinylated to bind to avidin coated platinum nanoparticles
(PtNPs). When N protein is present, immunosandwich complexes form between the
magnetic microbeads and PtNPs. After washing, the immunocomplexes are pulled
down into a microwell array in the Microbubbling Chip via an external magnetic field,
where microbubbles are generated through degradation of H2O2 catalyzed by PtNPs.
The microbubble images, captured using a smartphone camera and a mobile
microscope, are analyzed by computer vision and ML algorithms, which generate
quantitative outputs (bubble size, number, total bubble volume) and classify the images
as either SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative.
To identify the best antibody pair to use in the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2
assay, we screened different antibody pairs that bind the SARS-CoV-2 N protein with
various capture/detection combinations (Supplementary Figure 1). The pair (N1 as
capture antibody, Np as detection antibody) that generated the highest analytical
sensitivity was chosen to design the assay (Figure 1). To assess the intrinsic analytical
sensitivity of the assay, different amounts of recombinant N protein were spiked into
PBS buffer and tested by the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay. As shown in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253847; this version posted March 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

Figure 2A, the number of microbubbles increased linearly with the concentration of N
protein between 0-20 pg/mL, with the LOD for recombinant N protein at 0.5 pg/mL (10.6
fM, blank + 3 std, n=10).
To assess the analytical specificity of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen
Assay towards different strains of coronaviruses, we challenged the assay with 3 human
coronaviruses: CoV-229e, CoV-NL63 and CoV-OC43. Human coronaviruses OC43,
229E and NL63 cause common cold and bronchiolitis, and are the pathogens that are
likely to be present in respiratory samples and possibly cross react in the Microbubbling
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay based on sequence homology. As shown in Figure 2B, no
significant difference in signal was observed between the blank and the 3 coronaviruses
(1x105 pfu/mL), while over 10 times signal increase was observed for SARS-CoV-2
(1x105 copies/mL or 1.4x104 pfu/mL), indicating the high analytical specificity of the
assay towards SARS-CoV-2.
We then evaluated the analytical performance of the assay in swab samples.
Mucosal swab samples contain catalase and peroxidase, which may interfere with the
Microbubbling Digital Assay by degrading the signaling reagent, H2O2. To assess this
possibility, recombinant N protein was spiked into a negative pool of NP swab samples
(confirmed by rRT-PCR to be negative for SARS-CoV-2) and tested in the Microbubbling
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay with and without PtNPs as catalyzing reagent. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 2, bubbles were only observed when PtNPs were present,
indicating catalase and peroxidase from the mucosal matrix had been eliminated during
washing steps, and did not interfere in the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay.

We subsequently challenged the assay with 10 rRT-PCR-negative NP swab
samples. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3A, the background signals of the 10
samples varied. To investigate if the background signal was specific to the Microbubbling
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay, a representative sample (sample 3, with a medium
background signal) was tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using
96 well plate bottom to immobilize the N1 capture antibody and luciferase as the reporter
enzyme labeled onto the Np detection antibody. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3B,
a medium background signal was also observed for sample 3, but not for buffer control,
in the ELISA assay. This indicates that the background was assay format-agnostic and
intrinsic to the swab matrix. Mucins have been reported as the major cause of nonspecific
bindings and background signals in many immunoassays using mucosal samples, 8 due
to their ability to bind to a variety of solid surfaces.9,10 Mucins are a family of glycoproteins
that are widely present in the upper respiratory system10, with high molecular weight, high
glycosylation, and abundance of negative charge groups. We postulated that mucins
were the source of the background signal in our assay. To eliminate the background
signal, we took advantage of the high molecular weight of mucins and used a filter with
molecular weight cutoff between mucins (200 kDa~200 MDa) and N protein (47.08 kDa)
(Pierce™ protein concentrator PES, 100K MWCO) to remove mucins and retain filtrate
for testing. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3C, background signals in the rRT-PCRnegative NP swab pool were removed by filtering the sample through the above
concentrator, while specific signals from SARS-CoV-2 were retained.
We compared the analytical sensitivity of the assay for inactivated SARS-CoV-2
spiked in buffer (without filtration) vs. in negative NP swab pool (with filtration). As shown

in Supplementary Figure 4, the analytical sensitivity in buffer (without filtration) was about
10 times higher than that in negative NP swab pool. These findings suggest that sample
matrix and sample processing have significant impact on the analytical performance of
the assay.
To determine the analytical sensitivity of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen
Assay in NP swabs, different amounts of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses were spiked
into an rRT-PCR-negative NP swab pool, lysed, filtered and tested using the
Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay. As shown in Figure 2C, the number of
microbubbles increased linearly with the concentrations of inactivated SARS-CoV-2
viruses, between 0-18000 copies/mL (virus genome RNA concentration, determined by
RT-qPCR using a primer set specific to nsp14), demonstrating the quantitative
capability of the assay. To determine the LOD following the FDA antigen assay
template11, we tested 10 rRT-PCR-negative NP swab pools, 21 swab pools spiked with
inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses at 2000 copies/mL and 21 pools at 4000 copies/mL.
As shown in Figure 2D, at the concentration of 2000 copies/mL, the signals of 17 out of
the 21 samples were above the mean of blank signal; at the concentration of 4000
copies/mL, the signals of all 21 samples were above the blank mean + 3std. Therefore
4000 copies/mL was determined as the LOD of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen
Assay for SARS-CoV-2 in swabs. This LOD translates to 400 virus copies/reaction (100
μL sample volume) in the assay.
Clinical Performance of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay
We tested deidentified residual clinical NP swab samples (at least 50 samples in
each category) using the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay, and compared the

results to clinical testing results using FDA EUA-approved rRT-PCR methods (Table 1,
list of rRT-PCR assays in Methods). Characteristics of the clinical samples, including
presence of symptoms, days after symptom onset and clinical locations were also listed
in Table 1. Samples with bubble count equal to or above the count generated at LOD
were determined to be positive, and those with bubble count below the LOD were
determined to be negative. Compared to rRT-PCR, the positive percent agreement
(PPA) was 97% (95% CI, 92-99%）in symptomatic individuals within 7 days of
symptom onset and positive nucleic acid results (n=128), and the negative percent
agreement (NPA) was 97% (95% CI, 94-100%) in symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals with negative nucleic acid results (n=73). The percent of antigen-positive
samples decreased in individuals at 7-12 days and >12 days after symptom onset or
initial COVID diagnosis, despite positive rRT-PCR results from the same samples.
In the asymptomatic but rRT-PCR-positive group (n=62), the PPA was 45% (95%
CI, 32-58%). The low PPA is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of this group, in
which individuals may present for testing at various stages of their infections (SARSCoV-2 testing was conducted as part of pre-surgery evaluation, prenatal care, or ED
visits with non-respiratory complaints), sometimes late enough that antigens have been
cleared by immune system (as we have observed in the symptomatic group). In this
asymptomatic group, the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay was able to detect
a pre-symptomatic case, in which both antigen and nucleic acid results were positive in
the swab sample collected one day before the patient developed cough and other
respiratory symptoms. This suggests the sensitivity of the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2
Antigen Assay is sufficiently high to detect the low concentration of antigen in pre-

symptomatic cases, and the discrepancy between antigen and nucleic acid results in
late samples are unlikely due to insufficient sensitivity of the Microbubbling Antigen
Assay.
Automatic Microbubble Detection Using Computer Vision and Image
Classification using ML Algorithm
We have previously demonstrated that the Microbubbling Digital Assay is a
platform that quantitates very low concentrations of biomarkers, with the number of
microbubbles correlating linearly with the biomarker concentration in the low
concentration range 7. In this study, we also observed that some clinical samples with
low Ct values or high viral loads generated large bubbles at the time of image capture (9
min for all experiments). Therefore, we developed a computer vision algorithm to detect
and locate microbubbles of any size in each image (Figure 3A) by identifying circle-like
shapes. Details of this algorithm are presented in Supplementary Materials.
Having automatically detected microbubble locations and sizes we add the
volumes of all bubbles to estimate the total bubble volume as a quantitative readout. As
shown in Figure 3B, log-transformed total bubble volume correlated inversely with Ct
values, and total bubble volume decreased with days-after-symptom-onset. This
indicates that total bubble volume may be a potential marker for antigen burden.
Next, we compared two approaches for automatic classification of microbubble
images as positives or negatives, both based on the computer vision-based
microbubble detection. First, we varied the threshold on the estimated total bubble
volume to generate an ROC curve (Figure 3C), using human visual inspection-based
classification as gold standard. We compared this against a ML-based classifier, built as

follows. In each image, we counted the number of detected bubbles whose radius was
above and below a set threshold (~50 microns, corresponding to 8 pixels in the images).
These big bubble and small bubble counts formed the 2-dimensional feature
representation of each image. In this 2-dimensional space, we trained a linear separator
using the linear support vector ML algorithm14. We randomly sampled 168 images to
use as the training dataset and evaluated the performance (of both approaches) on the
remaining 168 images (87 negatives, and 81 positives). Fig 3C shows both the ROC
curve of the total bubble volume-based classifier, as well as the sensitivity and
specificity of the 2D bubble count features-based ML classifier. The ML classifier
performs with much higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (95%) than any point on
the bubble volume thresholding ROC curve. The decision boundaries identified by the
ML classifier is shown in Figure 3D. These results were very stable across three
random 50-50 splits of the full dataset (336 images) into training and testing data.
Overall, this demonstrates that fully automated image analysis and ML are able to
produce antigen burden quantitation and accurate classification from the Microbubbling
SARS-CoV-2 Antigen assay. For easy reproducibility, we will publicly release all code
for computer vision-based microbubble detection and ML.
Tracking Antigen Dynamics in Different Patient Populations
In the clinical validation group (Table 1), antigen and nucleic acid results showed
limited correlation in individuals after the acute infection phase (>7 days). To further
investigate this phenomenon longitudinally, we tested for antigen using the
Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay in serial NP/oropharyngeal (OP) swabs
collected from 38 ICU patients hospitalized due to COVID (Figure 4A). To compare

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253847; this version posted March 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

nucleic acid with antigen dynamics, N1 gene copy number quantitated using RT-qPCR
were also plotted in Figure 4A. Consistent with what was observed in Table 1, nucleic
acid and antigen results did not always correlate with each other in this patient cohort.
Many serial samples did not have detectable N antigens despite significant copy
numbers of the N1 gene (>>4000 copies/mL). Several patients (eg. #406, #391, #257)
converted from N antigen positive to antigen negative at various time points despite that
N1 gene copies either increased or remained stable and above LOD of the
Microbubbling assay. This suggests the RT-qPCR may be detecting N1 gene fragments
that were not producing intact N protein with the epitope for antibody recognition. On the
other hand, for patient #401, N1 gene copy number increase correlated with the change
of N antigen result from negative to positive, possibly indicating active virus replication
during this period.
Immunocompromised individuals remained antigen positive for a longer period of
time in our validation group (Table 1). Out of 4 immunocompromised and nucleic acidpositive patients, who either had hematological malignancies or transplants, and were
7-12 days after symptom onset, all 4 were antigen positive (100% positivity rate,
compared to 53% in the entire validation group in the 7-12 days range). Out of 13
immunocompromised and nucleic acid-positive patients >12 days after symptom onset,
9 remained antigen positive (69% positivity rate, compared to 26% in the entire
validation group in the >12 days range). It has been reported that immunocompromised
individuals with hematological malignancies have prolonged viral clearance and delayed
or absent humoral responses12. We therefore tracked antigen results at various daysafter-symptom-onset in a group of 13 immunocompromised patients with either

hematological malignancies or transplants (Figure 4B). Notably, nucleic acid was
detected in all samples for these patients, while antigen was detectable for various
periods of time. For the 6 patients for whom we had samples at or after 30 days after
symptom onset, 5 remained antigen positive around 30 days. Two patients (#7 and #6)
converted from antigen positive to negative at 54 and 57 days, respectively. The
furthest antigen-positive timepoint observed in this group was from a patient (#4) post
CAR-T therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who continued to have respiratory
issues and tested positive for both nucleic acid and antigen 2 months after initial COVID
diagnosis. Our results indicate that immunocompromised individuals have delayed and
variable antigen clearance timeline, which correlates poorly with their nucleic acid
results.
Discussion
We have demonstrated that the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay can
detect the N antigen with an analytical sensitivity of 0.5 pg/mL (10.6 fM) and high
specificity. The LOD in buffer is 100 times better than commercially available SARSCoV-2 N protein ELISA kits (Supplemental Table 1). The LOD in swabs (4000
copies/mL) is comparable to many FDA EUA-approved rRT-PCR assays (102-105
copies/mL), better than current EUA-approved lateral flow antigen tests, the majority of
emerging SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays and CRISPR-based tests (Supplemental Table
1). Clinical validation comparing to EUA-approved rRT-PCR methods showed excellent
PPA and NPA in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals for acute infection
detection (<7 days). Residual NP swabs in 3mL saline tubes were used for convenience
during our clinical validation. We expect higher PPA using swabs directly reconstituted

using a lower volume of extraction reagents, which can be tested in future studies.
These findings suggest that the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay may be a
valuable tool in detecting acute SARS-CoV-2 infections. The gradual decrease in PPA
in samples after 7 days of symptom onset is consistent with seroconversion13 and
clearance of antigen from the body. It has been suggested that infectivity of individuals
with high Ct values and symptom onset to testing > 8 days is low14, and it was
hypothesized that the sensitive molecular methods detect viral genomic fragments,
rather than transmissible viruses 4,15,16. Our data in Table 1 and Figure 4A are
consistent with this hypothesis. The fact that the Microbubbling Antigen Assay was able
to detect a pre-symptomatic infection case indicates that the assay has the required
sensitivity to detect pre-symptomatic antigen levels. The lower PPA in asymptomatic
individuals is likely due to the heterogeneity of the asymptomatic group, some of whom
might have presented to the study after antigen had been cleared by the immune
system while genomic fragments remained.
We have also demonstrated that total bubble volume, a quantitative output from
the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay, correlated inversely with Ct values and
days-after-symptom-onset, and may serve as a potential marker for antigen burden.
This allows us to probe and monitor the level and dynamics of virus antigens at different
stages of infection, and to explore the correlation between antigen burden and disease
severity/prognosis in future studies, which may be valuable in advancing understanding
of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. With the exception of some reports focusing on antigens in

in respiratory samples and other body fluids during the infection course. Although it is

widely reported that infected individuals may test positive for viral nucleic acids for
weeks or months despite symptom resolution, it is unknown whether viral antigens also
remain positive for extended time in these individuals. Our data demonstrated that in
immunocompetent individuals, antigen is often cleared much faster than nucleic acid in
respiratory samples. On the other hand, we also showed that immunocompromised
individuals remained antigen positive for much longer periods of time, and cleared
antigen at various timepoints. In general, antigen dynamics did not correlate well with
that of nucleic acids outside of the acute infection window. Simultaneous positivity for
both antigen and nucleic acid in the same respiratory sample may be an indicator of
actively replicating viruses, and necessity for virus genome sequencing to monitor for
variants in prolonged infections, and may also inform the appropriate allocation and
utilization of isolation resources (negative pressure rooms, PPE etc.) for patient
management.
We expect that the Microbubbling Antigen Assay will be able to detect acute
infections earlier than lateral flow assays, thereby mitigating concerns for false
negatives using rapid antigen tests. However, we did not test this hypothesis in a sideby-side comparison study. Another limitation of the study is that the data of days-sincesymptom-onset came from limited documentation in the medical records based on
patient self-reporting. These data may not always be accurate or complete. Ct values
were not available from some rRT-PCR methods used in this study, and are in general
not well-standardized across platforms 19. This may lead to heterogeneity in the nucleic
acid data presented. We had access to a relatively small number of serial samples from
immunocompromised patients. Finally, due to the poor culturability of most clinical

specimens, we did not use viral culture to assess the infectivity of antigen positive
samples.
In future studies, the Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay can be
automated and multiplexed with other infectious disease antigens, and applied to other
sample types. With the convenient computer vision and ML based algorithms on
smartphone for automated bubble recognition, quantitation and result classification, this
assay also has the potential to be used at the point-of-care for frequent and repeated
testing. Our relatively simple computer vision and ML pipeline produced accurate
automatic classification results, which we expect will be further improved through
training more sophisticated deep learning-based systems on larger datasets. In
particular, a common failure mode in our current visual bubble detection system is when
bubbles appear blurry because they are not on the focal plane, or are inconsistently lit in
different portions of an image. These may be overcome through a bubble detector that,
like the ML classifier, is also learned from data, rather than the current system that is
engineered to locate circle-like shapes in the image. Finally, in an integrated system,
the microbubble results could also be conveniently uploaded into a database that
integrates other clinical parameters and molecular/serology results etc. to provide a
comprehensive picture of the disease in the population, enabling disease tracking and
future predictive algorithm development.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the Microbubbling Digital Antigen
Assay can be applied to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen with high sensitivity and
specificity. The Microbubbling SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Assay demonstrated high PPA and
NPA with rRT-PCR methods in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals early in the

and classify the image output, and also shown that the assay can be a valuable tool in
providing insights into antigen dynamics in various patient populations.
