Abstract
Background
Aortic stenosis requires timely treatment with either surgical aortic valve replacement
(SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aimed to investigate
the indirect impact of COVID-19 on national SAVR and TAVR activity and outcomes.
Methods
The UK TAVR Registry and the National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit were used to identify
all TAVR and SAVR procedures in England, between January 2017 and June 2020. The
number of isolated AVR, AVR+coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, AVR+other
surgery and TAVR procedures per month was calculated. Separate negative binomial
regression models were fit to monthly procedural counts, with functions of time as covariates,
to estimate the expected change in activity during COVID-19.
Results
We included 13376 TAVR cases, 12328 isolated AVR cases, 7829 AVR+CABG cases, and
6014 AVR+Other cases. Prior to March 2020 (UK lockdown), monthly TAVR activity was
rising, with a slight decrease in SAVR activity during 2019. We observed a rapid and
significant drop in TAVR and SAVR activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for
elective cases. Cumulatively, over the period March to June 2020, we estimated an expected
2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis who have not received treatment.
Conclusion
This study has demonstrated a significant decrease in TAVR and SAVR activity in England
following the COVID-19 outbreak. This situation should be monitored closely, to ensure that
monthly activity rapidly returns to expected levels. There is potential for significant backlog
in the near-to-medium term, and potential for increased mortality in this population.

Introduction
The pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] presents a global health
crisis and has resulted in significant excess mortality worldwide [2]. As a result, many
countries have imposed restrictions based on physical/social distancing and on movement
(i.e. ‘lockdowns’), with the aim of mitigating and managing the spread of COVID-19. In the
UK, the first confirmed case was recorded on 28th January 2020, with the first fatality from
COVID-19 being announced on 5th March 2020 [3]. A UK-wide lockdown was initiated on
23rd March 2020.
The lockdown restrictions, and the pandemic itself, have resulted in widespread changes in
operational activity of health services. Many countries and healthcare systems have faced
significant pressure on services, particularly within critical care [4,5]. This has necessitated
the need for restructuring of resources to meet those needs. Simultaneously, COVID-19 has
influenced the ways in which people interact with health services. For example, previous
studies have illustrated that there have been significant decreases in the number of admissions
and diagnosis of many health conditions, including for acute coronary syndromes [6–10],
stroke [11,12] and cancer referrals [13]. It is crucial to understand the consequences of this on
public health and on future healthcare resource requirements, especially for conditions
requiring timely healthcare interventions due to their adverse effect on prognosis, such as
severe symtomatic aortic stenosis.
Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease and, while many patients with
aortic stenosis are asymptomatic, the onset of symptoms is associated with rapid
deterioration. Thus, timely treatment by either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is key. SAVR has been the default treatment
strategy for symptomatic aortic stenosis, although TAVR has emerged as an effective option
across operative-risk strata [14–18]. While the activity and outcomes for aortic valve
replacements (surgical and transcatheter) have been studied in historic cohorts [19], there is a
lack of data in contemporary practice, especially surrounding the impact of COVID-19 from
a national perspective.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the activity and post-procedural outcomes
of all aortic valve replacements (AVRs) in contemporary practice, from a national
perspective, and to investigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on activity and outcomes.
The intention is to estimate the effect of reduced activity on projected backlog of cases.

Methods
UK TAVR Registry
The UK TAVR registry collects patient demographics, risk factors for intervention,
procedural details, and in-hospital adverse outcomes/complications for every TAVR
procedure undertaken within the UK [20]. Data collection occurs prospectively at each
contributing centre, and is submitted to the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes
Research (NICOR). Data collection is mandated for all centres licensed to undertake TAVR
procedures. We extracted data from NICOR on all TAVR procedures undertaken in England
between January 2017, and June 2020.

UK National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit
The NICOR National Adult Cardiac Surgery Audit (NACSA) contains data on all major heart
operations undertaken in the UK and Ireland [21]. We extracted all surgical aortic valve
replacements (SAVRs) undertaken in England between 2017 and 2020. We defined SAVR to
be any procedure that was recorded in NASCA as being a valve replacement procedure, and
where the aortic valve implant type was recorded as being mechanical, biological, homograft
or autograft replacement. Moreover, we further categorised SAVRs into (i) isolated AVR, (ii)
AVR with coronary artery bypass graft (AVR+CABG), or (iii) AVR with other surgery
(AVR+Other). Here, “other surgery” was defined as any mitral valve procedure, tricuspid
valve procedure, pulmonary valve procedure, major aortic surgery, or other cardiothoracic
procedures.
For both the UK TAVR registry and the NACSA registry, the British Cardiovascular
Intervention Society and the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery have made significant efforts
to maintain data flows during this period, and have provided weekly uploads of data.
Outcomes
The primary outcome considered in this study was presentation and treatment of severe
symptomatic aortic stenosis with either SAVR or TAVR. As secondary outcomes, we
considered 30-day mortality and post-procedural length of stay. Mortality information was
provided by linking the UK TAVR registry and the NACSA with the office for national
statistics civil registration of deaths dataset. Linkage was made based on each patient’s NHS
number (a unique identifier given to all patients resident in England). Given that death
registration is mandatory, this mortality data is definitive. We defined post-procedural length
of stay to be the number of days between the TAVR/SAVR procedure and hospital discharge.
Statistical Analysis
We excluded any cases in which the age of the patient at the time of the procedure was under
18 years. Additionally, we excluded cases where the NHS number was missing (since this
variable was used for mortality linkage) or with missing procedure urgency (since this is a
crucial variable in describing activity of TAVR/SAVR). Finally, we removed any duplicate
cases in either datasets, with duplicates identified using NHS number, age at the time of
operation, sex, admission date, and date/time of the procedure.
In all analyses, we stratified by procedure type (i.e. isolated AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other
or TAVR). Our aim was not to compare procedure types, but rather to explore features of
each therapy individually. We made no formal comparisons between these procedural types,
since there are a number of confounding factors surrounding the decision-making between
TAVR/SAVR (many of which are not captured in the dataset) - that is, due to potential for
confounding by treatment indication. Thus, all analyses focus on within-procedure-type
comparisons, rather than between-procedure-type comparisons.
Cases performed between 1st February and June 2020 were defined into a “during COVID19” group, with any case performed in these same months across the preceding years
(i.e. 2017-2019) being defined into a “pre-COVID-19” group. The 1st February 2020 was
chosen since the first COVID-19 case reported in England was on 28th January 2020. A
sensitivity analysis was undertaken, where we took 1st April as the cut-off point (based on
date of UK lockdown); results were quantitatively similar to those reported here (available on
request).

We report patient baseline characteristics for each procedure type (i.e. isolated AVR,
AVR+CABG, AVR+Other or TAVR), as whole cohorts and across the “during COVID-19”
and “pre-COVID-19” groups. Continuous variables were reported using the mean with
standard deviations. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies of occurrence with
relative percentages. Temporal changes in predicted procedural risk are displayed by plotting
the monthly average of the UK TAVR prediction model [22] for all TAVR procedures, and
the Logistic EuroSCORE [23] for all SAVR procedures through time. These models were
chosen for their respective uses as benchmarking tools for TAVR and SAVR. For the
purposes of calculating the risk predictions, missing values in any predictor variables were set
to “risk factor absent”, representing a plausible missingness process in the registries
[19,22,24].
The number of procedures per month was calculated across the full study period, separately
for isolated AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other and TAVR. Percentage increase or decrease in
monthly activity was calculated for each “during COVID-19” month, against the respective
“pre-COVID-19” months. Similarly, we calculated the minimum, mean and maximum
number of TAVR/SAVR procedures per month across 2017 and 2019, and compared these
visually with the corresponding monthly counts in 2020 (up until June 2020). We fitted
negative binomial models to the number of TAVR/SAVR procedures performed per month
between January 2017 and December 2019, using time as covariates, which was modelled
both continuously to capture increasing/decreasing trends in outcome and as a factor variable
of month to capture any seasonality. This model was used to estimate the expected number of
TAVR/SAVR procedures per month in 2020, to compare with the observed activity level.
For each of the four procedural types (i.e. isolated AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other or
TAVR), we compared mortality up to 30-days, across the “during COVID-19” and “preCOVID-19” groups by fitting a Cox proportional hazards model, with the COVID-19 group
as a covariate. Additionally, we adjusted for procedural risk by including the linear predictor
of the UK TAVR prediction model [22] or the Logistic EuroSCORE [23], as appropriate.
Differences in post-procedural length of stay between the “during COVID-19” and “preCOVID-19” groups were also investigated by fitting a Cox proportional hazards model, with
the aforementioned variables as covariates. The proportional hazards assumption was
checked by examining the Schoenfeld residuals.
All analyses were performed using R version 4.0.0 [25], along with the tidyverse suite of
packages [26], and the survival package [27,28].

Results
The UK TAVR registry included 13995 procedures across the study period, of which we
included 13376 in our analysis after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The
NACSA registry included 97108 cases over the study period, of which we included 26171
SAVR procedures, comprised of 12328 (47.1%) isolated AVR, 7829 (29.9%) AVR+CABG,
and 6014 (23%) AVR+Other cases.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the isolated AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other
and TAVR cases included in this study. The mean age of isolated AVR, AVR+CABG,
AVR+Other and TAVR was 67.7, 72.3, 62.9 and 81.3, respectively. Across all surgical
groups, the majority of cases were male. For the surgical AVR groups, the mean Logistic
EuroSCORE was 7.52%, 10.7% and 13.9% for isolated AVR, AVR+CABG and

AVR+Other, respectively, while the mean UK TAVR prediction model was 3.13% ( Table
1).
TAVR and SAVR Activity
There has been a steady increase in the number of TAVR procedures performed per month
between January 2017 and December 2019, with the majority of procedures being elective (
Figure 1). While the number of monthly AVR+CABG and AVR+Other procedures remained
relatively stable pre-2020, there was a slight decrease in the number of elective isolated AVR
cases per month in 2019. Specifically, the average number of elective isolated AVR cases per
month was 250 in 2017 and 252 in 2018, while the monthly activity in 2019 decreased from
226 cases in January, to 151 cases by December ( Figure 1). This trend continued into early
2020, with isolated AVR and AVR+CABG activity being lower throughout 2020, compared
with historic levels ( Figure 2). After 1st March 2020 there was a significant drop in activity
across all AVR procedures compared with historic levels ( Figure 2). There was a slight
recovery in AVR activity in May and June 2020.
The drop in AVR activity was particularly pronounced for elective cases. The number of
elective SAVR procedures, was below 100 cases per month after March 2020 for each of
isolated AVR, AVR+CABG and AVR+Other ( Figure 1). In contrast, while the number of
elective TAVR cases also dropped after March 2020, there remained >100 elective TAVR
cases per month. The relative drop (percentage change) in monthly activity between 2020 and
historic levels was lower for TAVR than SAVR with a maximum percentage difference of
83.5%, 91.8%, 72.6% and 46.3%, for isolated AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other and TAVR,
respectively ( Figure 2, panel B).
Fitting a negative binomial model to the monthly TAVR and SAVR procedures between
2017 and 2019 shows the expected and actual monthly AVR activity during 2020 ( Figure 3).
Specifically, the estimated difference (95% CI) in the number of TAVR cases per month
compared with those expected based on historic trends was -41 (-79, -3) in March 2020, -222
(-257, -187) in April 2020, -188 (-226, -150) in May 2020, and -197 (-234, -159) in June
2020 ( Figure 3, panel B). The estimated decrease in Isolated AVR activity was -189 (-220, 158), -233 (-260, -207), -206 (-235, -177) and -171 (-199, -143), across March-June 2020,
respectively. Similar observations were made for AVR+CABG and AVR+Other cases (
Figure 3, panel B). Cumulatively, over the period March to June 2020, this amounts to an
estimated expected drop of 2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis in
England, of which 799 (95% CI 685, 913) were for isolated AVR, 488 (95% CI 407, 570)
were for AVR+CABG, 358 (95% CI 280, 436) were for AVR+Other, and 648 (95% CI 500,
796) were for TAVR.
Evolution of Patient Demographics and Procedural Risk
Table 2 shows patient baseline characteristics of isolated AVR cases across the pre-COVID19 and during-COVID-19 groups. For isolated AVR, the mean age was significantly lower in
the during-COVID-19 group than the pre-COVID-19 group (p<0.001), and there was a
significantly higher CCS angina status (p<0.001), NYHA class (p<0.001) and mean PA
systolic pressure (p<0.001). For AVR+CABG, there was no evidence of a significant
difference in the majority of patient demographics between the during-COVID-19 group and
the pre-COVID-19 group (Supplementary Table 1). Specifically, NYHA class (p<0.001)
and mean PA Systolic pressure (p=0.004) were significantly higher in the during-COVID-19
group compared to the pre-COVID-19 group. For AVR+Other, there was a significantly
higher proportion of male patients (p=0.001, Supplementary Table 2), and a higher NYHA

class (p=0.029), between the during-COVID-19 group and the pre-COVID-19 group. For
TAVR cases, the mean age, proportion of current/ex smokers and mean creatinine were
significantly lower in the during-COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group
(Table 3). Additionally, there was a lower proportion of TAVR cases with previous MI
(p<0.001), previous cardiac surgery (p<0.001), and extracardiac arteriopathy (p=0.010) in the
during-COVID-19 group, compared with the pre-COVID-19 group. The distribution of
procedure urgency categories was significantly different between the during-COVID-19
group and the pre-COVID-19 group, for isolated AVR (p<0.001, Table 2), AVR+CABG
(p=0.001, Supplementary Table 1), AVR+Other (p<0.001, Supplementary Table 2), and
TAVR (p<0.001, Table 3).
Overall procedural risk, as estimated by the Logistic EuroSCORE, has remained relatively
stable over time for isolated AVR, AVR+CABG and AVR+Other (Supplementary Figure
1). There was no significant difference in the mean Logistic EuroSCORE between the preCOVID-19 groups and during-COVID-19 groups for isolated AVR, AVR+CABG or
AVR+Other cases (Table 2, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). For
TAVR, overall procedural risk, as estimated by the UK TAVR prediction model, dropped
significantly over 2017, with this stabilizing to approximately 4% for non-elective cases and
approximately 2.5% for elective cases (Supplementary Figure 1). While the mean UK
TAVR prediction model was significantly lower in the during-COVID-19 group compared
with the pre-COVID-19 group (p<0.001, Table 3), this was largely driven by 2017 cases
(Supplementary Figure 1).
Between 2017 and December 2019, there has been a steady increase in the monthly TAVR
activity in the lowest quantiles of risk strata (estimated by UK TAVR prediction model),
while the monthly activity in the highest quantiles of risk strata as remained relatively stable
(Supplementary Figure 2). After March 2020, TAVR activity was reduced across all
quantiles of risk strata. In contrast, the monthly activity of isolated AVR, AVR+CABG and
AVR+Other has been gradually decreasing through time across all quantiles of risk strata
(defined by Logistic EuroSCORE), with this continuing post March 2020 (Supplementary
Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 4, and Supplementary Figure 5).
Outcomes
The overall (unadjusted) Kaplan-Meier estimates of 30-day survival were 98.5% for isolated
AVR, 95.9% for AVR+CABG, 94.9%, for AVR+Other, and 97.5% for TAVR. We found no
significant difference in mortality hazards up to 30-days post procedure between the preCOVID-19 group and the during-COVID-19 group for isolated AVR, AVR+CABG,
AVR+Other or TAVR ( Table 4).
The median length of stay (LOS) following TAVR was 3 days (interquartile range: 2-5 days)
in the pre-COVID-19 group, and 2 days (interquartile range: 1-3 days) in the during-COVID19 group. The median (interquartile range) LOS in the pre-COVID-19 group for isolated
AVR, AVR+CABG and AVR+Other was 7 (5-9) days, 8 (6-12) days and 9 (6-15) days,
respectively, with these being 6 (5-9) days, 7 (5-10) days and 8 (6-13) days in the duringCOVID-19 group. For AVR+CABG and AVR+Other procedures performed in the duringCOVID-19 period, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for early discharge were 1.21 (1.08,
1.35)and 1.16 (1.04, 1.3), respectively, showing significantly shorter LOS ( Table 5). For
TAVR, the hazard ratio for shorter LOS was modelled as a function of time to account for
non-proportional hazards, with time demonstrating significantly shorter LOS for the duringCOVID-19 group, up to 2 days post procedure.

Discussion
This national study is the first to investigate activity and outcomes following all aortic valve
replacement procedures in contemporary practice, including the potential indirect impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed a rapid and significant decrease in TAVR and SAVR
activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimated that over the period March to June
2020, this decline in activity accounts for an estimated 2294 patients with severe aortic
stenosis left untreated by TAVR or surgical intervention. This will have major implications
on this cohort of patients whose untreated mortality is high. Nevertheless, we also report that
despite restructure of healthcare services nationally during COVID-19, overall procedural
risk has maintained relatively constant, and there was no evidence of a difference in
procedure-related mortality outcomes during this period.
The treatment of severe aortic stenosis has evolved rapidly over the last decade, moving from
SAVR being the default treatment modality, to a situation in which TAVR is now an
evidence-based option at all surgical risk categories [14–18]. This study observed changes in
TAVR and SAVR activity, with steadily increasing TAVR activity and corresponding slight
decreases in elective isolated AVR cases, up-to 2019. This supports previous findings in this
area [19]. Although TAVR is currently only approved for inoperable or high-risk cases in the
UK, the evidence of equivalence in low-risk cases in accumulating [18,29]. This may
partially explain our finding of a steadily increasing proportion of TAVR cases within the
lowest quantile of risk (as quantified by the UK TAVR prediction model), prior to 2020. The
observed decrease in SAVR activity (particularly elective isolated AVR cases) before
COVID-19, also provides evidence that the clinical envelope for TAVR has expanded into
lower risk cases within real-world contemporary practice.
Inevitably, the initiation of national lockdown in the UK was associated with a significant
reduction in the monthly number of TAVR and SAVR procedures being performed. We
found a maximum percentage decrease in monthly activity between January and June 2020
compared with corresponding historic levels of 83.5%, 91.8%, 72.6% and 46.3%, for isolated
AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other and TAVR, respectively, demonstrating a relatively
smaller fall in TAVR than SAVR. Even between March and June 2020, there remained over
100 elective TAVR cases per month, compared with a near-complete reduction in elective
SAVR. One potential explanation is that TAVR has a very low probability of requiring stay
in an intensive treatment unit after the procedure, which is important given constraints during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, during the pandemic, patients with severe symptomatic
aortic stenosis were recommended to be treated by TAVR where appropriate [30]. However,
given that the UK TAVR registry and the NACSA dataset does not contain information on
the decision-making behind the SAVR or TAVR choice, we are not able to investigate this
directly within this study.
The observed reduction in TAVR/SAVR activity was largely driven by elective cases, with
this study showing that non-elective cases have remained relatively stable post March 2020.
A possible explanation for this was that the UK government response to the COVID-19
pandemic was to recommend cancellation of elective procedures [31]. This was made to
allow a re-structuring of hospital services, thereby allowing more staff and resource to deal
with the increased admissions due to COVID-19. Simultaneously, this reduces exposure of
individual patients and their relatives to the hospital environment, and reduces exposure of
healthcare workers to asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We observed that monthly activity
for TAVR and SAVR had a slight recovery in May and June 2020, following the initial drop
during March and April 2020. We were unable to investigate the reasons for this, but a

similar observation was made for admissions for acute coronary syndrome [6]. Again, one
could speculate that this relates to decreasing demands on healthcare systems as the pandemic
evolved, with an aim to resume elective activity once the peak of the pandemic had passed.
While the observed temporal changes in TAVR and SAVR activity are perhaps unsurprising,
the marked drop in cases post COVID-19 does raise important implications for healthcare
resource planning in the near-to-medium term. Our estimates surrounding the difference in
the number of AVR procedures per month in 2020 compared with historic trends mean that
there will likely be significant increased demand for TAVR and SAVR. This will lead to an
inevitable increase in waiting times [32], and associated adverse impacts on outcomes [33].
Recommendations for how to manage this challenge are emerging [32,34]. Since the NACSA
and UK TAVR registry datasets only contain data on those who undergo TAVR/SAVR, it
was not possible for us to forecast future demand for AVR (since we do not have information
on patients who are candidates for AVR, but who have not currently undergone the
procedure). However, based on the available data, we estimated that, cumulatively, between
March and June 2020, there were 2294 (95% CI 1872, 2716) cases of severe aortic stenosis
who have not received treatment in England. Previous studies have shown that, under normal
circumstances, the median wait-time for TAVR is 80 days [35]. Thus, assuming these figures
apply to AVR generally, one could postulate that this means approximately 1147 patients will
remain untreated by 80 days (increasing to 1720 if procedures in the near-to-medium term are
made at 50% capacity), even without considering the additional cases over this period. While
such figures are an approximation, they do give some indication of expected levels of
increased demand that SAVR and TAVR centres might expect as the lockdown restriction
continues to be relaxed. On a national-level, it is clear that strategies will be required to
mitigate this large backlog of cases, in order to reduce avoidable deaths in patients with
severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who remain untreated.
Indeed, it remains unclear what effect the reduction in the number of procedures per month
has had on outcomes for patients with aortic stenosis who would otherwise have been treated
with AVR during March - June 2020. Some of these patients might be alive and waiting for
AVR intervention, or might have died from aortic stenosis, COVID-19 or from other causes.
Previous studies have estimated that the risk of death whilst waiting for intervention for
server aortic stenosis in routine clinical practice is between 2% and 14% [36]. This means
that of the estimated 2294 currently delayed cases, there will be between 46 and 321 deaths
while waiting for intervention, if capacity returns to normal. Any additional delays due to the
backlog will lead to increased mortality. Of course, these are approximate figures and does
not account for excess mortality due to COVID-19 [37].
Several limitations should be noted when interpreting the results of this study. Firstly, we
make no statistical comparisons between isolated AVR, AVR+CABG, AVR+Other or TAVR
groups. Any such comparisons would be subject to confounding by indication. This means
that we were not able to investigate changes in patient-level propensity to undergo SAVR
vs. TAVR through the COVID-19 period, since the decision-making behind the SAVR
vs. TAVR choice was not recorded in these data. Secondly, while we used the Logistic
EuroSCORE to summarise overall SAVR procedural risk, this model is known to overpredict
mortality risk. However, this model is commonly used for benchmarking in national
cardiovascular registries, and we use the model in the same capacity here. Thirdly, this
analysis is limited to procedures in England; however, given that COVID-19 has caused
changes in healthcare utilisation globally, one might expect similar findings in other
healthcare settings. Finally, some delays in reporting during the pandemic might contribute to
some of the results; however, the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society and the Society

for Cardiothoracic Surgery have made significant efforts to maintain data flows during this
period, and have provided weekly uploads of data. Thus, this limitation is potentially
minimised.
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated a significant drop in TAVR and SAVR activity
following the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. The case-mix of patients who have undergone
SAVR or TAVR during the COVID-19 period was similar to the case-mix seen in the preCOVID-19 period, with no evidence of a difference in mortality outcomes. The activity
across both SAVR and TAVR should be closely monitored to ensure that monthly cases
correctly return to expected levels. These data suggest that there will be a sharp rise in
demand for AVR intervention in the near-to-medium term, with the potential for an upturn in
mortality in patients waiting to be treated.
