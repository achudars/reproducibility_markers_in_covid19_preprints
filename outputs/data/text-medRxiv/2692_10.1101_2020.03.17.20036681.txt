an important role in the spread of infectious diseases. Although China has served as the

36

epicenter of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, real-time phylogenetic analysis [2] suggests

37

that the virus was introduced to most

38

traveling from Italy. Migration has remained the major source of concern for the current

39

COVID-19 outbreak and most countries have focused on China as the likely source of any

40

importation. The movement of people between China and sub-Saharan Africa has increased

41

rapidly over the last decade [3, 4], the spread of COVID-19 to the African continent has been

42

more related to the current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. There has been much attention on

43

the importation of infectious diseases such as Ebola, Tuberculosis,

from Africa to Europe [5, 6]. Conversely, there are few reported cases of importing diseases

In addition to the phylogenetic analysis, a number of other circumstantial factors

model with a binomial distribution of the number of people experience an event at a

specific time step. The events are infection, migration, emigration, recovery and death

due to COVID-19. We neglected natural death, as this does not affect our result. We

further assumed that no countries except the epicenters are experiencing outbreak.

Hence the basic reproduction number at the epicentres is
