METHODS
The study has conducted a digital search on MOOC platforms like Coursera, edX, FutureLearn,
XuentangX, Udacity, Miríadax, Alison, Canvas Network, OpenWHO, among others to identify
MOOCs with content related to health education (education, promotion, and prevention of
health) aimed at the general public. Also, the search involved explored topics related to health,

Three authors conducted the MOOC search manually and independently on the mentioned
virtual platforms. The search development was in the month of June and December 2020.
Likewise, we had to consult websites on larger platforms available in the world like Class

MOOCs were that it evidences content related to health education, aimed at the general
population; further, we consider being available for registration/access at the time of the
search.

Subsequently, through a peer review, the researchers excluded MOOCs that showed highly
specialized content or requested a prerequisite. MOOCs aimed at professionals or indicated
that they were MOOCs for professional certification were also not considered, as well, only
available for paid content. If a conflict or inconsistency existed about our exclusion criteria was
solved through the deliberation peer review. We organized MOOCs by groups according to
similar topics for a better description.

The data analysis was about the place of origin, principal language, and duration of the course.

RESULTS
With the established search criteria, a total of 217 MOOC courses were found on the different
platforms, after excluding MOOC courses because they were specialized, unavailable, aimed at
other target audiences, or without relation to health education.

We selected 117 of the total

MOOCs to be analyzed (Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
We identified 117 MOOC courses on health promotion the majority are offered in English and
are carried out mainly by institutions on the European continent and mostly found topics were
health promotion and food and nutrition.

From the preliminary search, was evidence that a large part of the MOOCs maintained among
their characteristics, possessing technical content of some specialty, learning units aimed at
professionals (16)(17) others offering professional certification (13)(18)(19)(20), and some are
not available upon request upon payment. Although we have not included these MOOCs in the
study, it is essential to notice that it can be an indicator of the limited supply of MOOCs with a
profile aimed at the general public or users of primary level care centers, with the content of
free health education and aimed at prevention and health care. Consider this is extremely
important for access to health education in a context of compulsory social isolation.

similarity was found with another study whose main topics were food, nutrition your health,
and introduction to health nursing, courses were aimed at professionals (21). The MOOCs on
health and medicine allow patients to acquire health education on specialized topics. They can
understand disease implications, conditions, techniques, and available interventions around
their disease, especially in the early stages. Besides, they can be useful some topics are still
taboo,

such

as

and

(AIDS); courses focused on these topics help people educate themselves without having to visit
an office.

The MOOCs found around psychology and mental health turn out to be a learning opportunity
for stress management in times of compulsory social isolation. The results end up being part of

recommendations to review said web-based interventions in mental health literacy promotion
(22). It is because adolescents and young people are the ones who present more difficulties
(23) for decision-making in health since when they search for information on the web (24), it is
evident that they do not differentiate reliable information from the less reliable and that they
do not know how to translate it into healthy behaviors (25).

Among other issues, community health and social rights take a position in the context of
compulsory social isolation since many decisions about health can be taken collectively in the
community environment (26), addition to many of them can be taken at the family level or by
the influence of peers, without considering the repercussions of community leadership in
some scenarios (27). Therefore, individual decisions can be even more relevant; For example,
vaccination can affect a significant group of the population and have an impact on a higher
incidence

of

some

pathologies

at

the

community

level

(28),

especially

when

there

is

a

population increase that declares not to be vaccinated even in front of the COVID19 pandemic
(29).

Therefore, access to information through a MOOC could empower people who would not
otherwise know about the options offered(21). This study shows that various institutions and
organizations

worldwide

have

seen

MOOCs

as

an

educational

opportunity

due

to

their

relatively low cost (30) and whose success depends on the quality of their contents (31), the
teacher's strategies, and the focused courses.

Similar to previous studies was evidence that the Coursera platform was the one that hosted
the largest number of MOOCs (21)(32). Regarding the origin of the MOOCs, the largest number
were from developed countries (33), from institutions in Europe and North America, similar
results were described in other studies (13)(21)(34), being, by default smaller quantity offered
by Latin American countries (35). This predominant origin could be because more than half of
the MOOCs were offered and developed in English (21)(13)(36) and only 22% in Spanish. Proof
of this is that of the 23, 13, and 4 MOOCs on psychology and mental health, health care,
community health / social rights, respectively, only one MOOC for each topic was in Spanish.

The

opportunities in times of pandemic for the Latin American population; as well as language,
aspects such as the absence of a computer and internet, educational level (37) is also limited
for access to MOOCs in times of compulsory social isolation.

Considering these courses were offered by developed countries as a fact. This issue could limit
the topics addressed from being oriented to a different health reality from that of developing
countries, where diseases such as anemia, malnutrition, or infectious diseases are the most
frequent. This scenario could explain the high level of results from North America and Europe
(38)(39) compared to South America, Africa, and Oceania (40) in MOOC courses. It was known
courses were build based on a context and socioeconomic condition for a target population,
and participation levels were higher when considered these variables (31). MOOCs with an
approach based on the reality of LMIC (41) could be an opportunity, addressing issues such as
chronic malnutrition, anemia, among frequent health problems that this population suffers,
even more so in times of pandemic due to the restricted care of primary health centers to
provide services on these issues.

Among the limitations were: The chosen courses are based exclusively on the authors' criteria.
The possibility of including studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria was lowered by
performing

the

peer

review.

Courses

into

education

considered when compiling MOOCs for the review. However, if a MOOC has an incorrect
classification, it would not have been identified for review. In cases MOOCs have been offered
in languages different than English, we used Google Translate for content translation. Finally,
the study aimed not to evaluate the quality of the contents in the MOOCs; however, almost all
the MOOCs declared their institutional origin, which was predominantly universities.

Finally, the study showed most of the MOOC courses in health education aimed at the general
population or users of health systems were framed mainly in the themes of health promotion
and food and nutrition, originating from European institutions and North America and with a
higher predominance of the English language.

MOOCs are showed as key tools to empower people, so in a pandemic context, the need to
invest

in

alternative

methods

of

dissemination

of

knowledge

for

knowledge-based

empowerment would arise, covering the capacities of the general public that at present it is
affected by not having access to care in health services of the first level of care. In addition to
this, a critical shortage of human resources in health and healthcare, comprising a limited
number

of

medical

professors

and

limitations

in

physical

infrastructures

are

reasons

that

increase the need to access online courses in health education of the level primary. Although
the MOOCs' origin was mainly from university institutions a future analysis of the quality of the
contents must be addressed for greater comprehensiveness.
