Summary
Continued uncontrolled transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in many parts of the world is creating the conditions for
significant virus evolution. Here, we describe a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2)
characterised by eight lineage-defining mutations in the spike protein, including three at
important residues in the receptor-binding domain (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may
have functional significance. This lineage emerged in South Africa after the first epidemic
wave in a severely affected metropolitan area, Nelson Mandela Bay, located on the coast of
the Eastern Cape Province. This lineage spread rapidly, becoming within weeks the dominant
lineage in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape Provinces. Whilst the full significance of the
mutations is yet to be determined, the genomic data, showing the rapid displacement of other
lineages, suggest that this lineage may be associated with increased transmissibility.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in 2019
and spread rapidly around the world, causing over 70 million recorded cases of coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) and over 1.6 million deaths by mid-December 2020. The failure of
public health measures to contain the spread of the virus within and between countries has
given rise to a large number of virus lineages across the world. Open genomic surveillance
data sharing and collaborative online platforms have enabled real-time tracking of the
emergence and spread of these lineages1,2.
To date there has been relatively limited evidence of SARS-CoV-2 mutations that have had a
significant functional effect on the virus. One mutation in the spike protein (D614G) emerged
early in the epidemic and spread rapidly through Europe and North America in particular.
Several lines of evidence now suggest that SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying this mutation have
increased transmissibility3-6. Later in the epidemic, lineages with a N439K mutation in the
spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) emerged independently in different European countries
and in the United States. This mutation is associated with escape from monoclonal antibody
(mAb) and polyclonal serum mediated neutralization7.
South Africa has been the most severely affected country in Africa, with over 56 000 excess
natural deaths having occurred by 8 December (approximately 950 per million population)8.
We have previously described the introduction and spread of several SARS-CoV-2 lineages,
and the emergence of unique South African lineages during the early phase of the
epidemic9,10. Here, we now describe the emergence and spread of a new SARS-CoV-2
lineage harbouring multiple nonsynonymous spike mutations, including mutations at key
sites in the RBD (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that may have functional significance. We
demonstrate that this lineage emerged after the first epidemic wave in the worst affected
metropolitan area within the Eastern Cape (EC) Province. This was followed by rapid spread
of this lineage to the extent that it has now become the dominant lineage in EC and Western
Cape (WC) Provinces.

Methods
Epidemiological dynamics
We analysed daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa up to 14 December 2020 from
publicly released data provided by the National Department of Health (NDoH) and the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases. This was accessible through the repository of
the Data Science for Social Impact Research Group at the University of Pretoria
(https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za)11,12. The NDoH releases daily updates on the number of
confirmed new cases, deaths and recoveries, with a breakdown by province. We also mapped
excess deaths in each province and in South Africa as a whole on to general epidemiological
data to determine the extent of potential under-reporting of case numbers and gauge the
severity of the epidemic. Excess deaths here are defined as the excess natural deaths (in
individuals aged 1 year and above) relative to the value predicted from 2018 and 2019 data,
setting any negative excesses to zero. We obtained the data from the Report on Weekly
Deaths from the South Africa Medical Research Council Burden of Disease Research Unit8.
We generated estimates for the effective reproduction number (Re) of SARS-CoV-2 in South

Africa from the covid-19-re data repository (https://github.com/covid-19-Re/dailyRe-Data) as
of 14 December 202013.

Sampling of SARS-CoV-2
As part of the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA)14, five
sequencing hubs receive randomly selected samples for sequencing every week according to
approved protocols at each site. These samples include remnant nucleic acid extracts or
remnant nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples from routine diagnostic SARSCoV-2 PCR testing from public and private laboratories in South Africa. In response to a
rapid resurgence of COVID-19 in EC and the Garden Route District of WC in November, we
enriched our routine sampling with additional samples from those areas. In total, we received
samples from over 50 health facilities in the EC and WC (Suppl Table 1, Suppl Fig. S1,
Suppl Fig. S2).

Whole genome sequencing and genome assembly
cDNA synthesis was performed on the extracted RNA using random primers followed by
gene specific multiplex PCR using the ARTIC V3 protocol15. Briefly, extracted RNA was
converted to cDNA using the Superscript IV First Strand synthesis system (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and random hexamer primers. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome
amplification was performed by multiplex PCR using primers designed on Primal Scheme
(http://primal.zibraproject.org/) to generate 400bp amplicons with an overlap of 70bp that
covers the 30Kb SARS-CoV-2 genome. PCR products were cleaned up using AmpureXP
purification beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and quantified using the Qubit
dsDNA High Sensitivity assay on the Qubit 4.0 instrument (Life Technologies Carlsbad,
CA).
We then used the Illumina® Nextera Flex DNA Library Prep kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol to prepare indexed paired end libraries of genomic DNA.
Sequencing libraries were normalized to 4nM, pooled and denatured with 0.2N sodium
acetate. 12pM sample library was spiked with 1% PhiX (PhiX Control v3 adapter-ligated
library used as a control). We sequenced libraries on a 500-cycle v2 MiSeq Reagent Kit on

the Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). We have previously
published full details of the amplification and sequencing protocol16,17.
We assembled paired-end fastq reads using Genome Detective 1.126
(https://www.genomedetective.com) and the Coronavirus Typing Tool18. We polished the
initial assembly obtained from Genome Detective by aligning mapped reads to the references
and filtering out low-quality mutations using bcftools 1.7-2 mpileup method. Mutations were
confirmed visually with bam files using Geneious software (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand).
All of the sequences were deposited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/), and the GISAID
accession IDs are included as part of Suppl Table 1. Raw reads for our sequences have also
been deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read
Archive.
Quality control of South African genomic sequences
We retrieved all South African SARS-CoV-2 genotypes from the GISAID database as of 14
December 2020 (N=2704). Prior to phylogenetic reconstruction, we removed low quality
sequences from this dataset. We filtered out genotypes that did not pass standard quality
assessment parameters employed in NextClade (https://clades.nextstrain.org). We filtered out
99 South African genotypes due to low coverage, and a further 16 due to poor sequence
quality. We therefore analyzed a total of 2589 South African genotypes. We also retrieved a
global reference dataset (N=2592). This was selected from the Nextstrain global reference
dataset, plus the five most similar sequences to each of the South African sequences as
defined by a local BLAST search.
Phylogenetic analysis
We initially analyzed South African genotypes against the global reference dataset using a
custom pipeline based on a local version of NextStrain2. The pipeline contains several python
scripts that manage the analysis workflow. It performs alignment of genotypes in MAFFT19,
phylogenetic tree inference in IQ-Tree20, tree dating and ancestral state construction and
annotation (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov).
The initial phylogenetic analysis allowed us to identify a large cluster of sequences (n=190)
with multiple spike mutations. We extracted this cluster and constructed a preliminary
maximum likelihood (ML) tree in IQ-tree, together with eight basal sequences from the
region sampled June-September 2020. We inspected this ML tree in TempEst v1.5.3 for the
presence of a temporal (i.e. molecular clock) signal. Linear regression of root-to-tip genetic
distances against sampling dates indicated that SARS-CoV-2 sequences evolved in a
relatively strong clock-like manner (correlation coefficient=0.65, R2=0.41) (Suppl Fig. S2).
We then estimated time-calibrated phylogenies using the Bayesian software package
BEASTv.1.10.4. For this analysis, we employed the strict molecular clock model, the
HKY+I, nucleotide substitution model and the exponential growth coalescent model21. We
computed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in duplicate runs of 100 million states each,
sampling every 10 000 steps. Convergence of MCMC chains was checked using Tracer
v.1.7.122. Maximum clade credibility trees were summarised from the MCMC samples using
TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% as burn-in.
Phylogeographic analysis

To model phylogenetic diffusion of the new cluster across the country, we used a flexible
relaxed random walk (RRW) diffusion model that accommodates branch-specific variation in
rates of dispersal with a Cauchy distribution23. For each sequence, latitude and longitude
were attributed to the health facility at which the diagnostic sample was obtained, or, if that
information was not available, to a point randomly sampled within the local area or district of
origin.
As above, MCMC chains were run in duplicate for 100 million generations and sampled
every 10 000 steps, with convergence assessed using Tracer v1.7.1. Maximum clade
credibility trees were summarized using TreeAnnotator after discarding 10% as burn-in. We
used the R package “seraphim” to extract and map spatiotemporal information embedded in
posterior trees.
Lineage classification
We used the dynamic lineage classification method proposed by Rambault et al. via the
Phylogenetic Assignment of named Global Outbreak LINeages (PANGOLIN) software suite
(https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin)24. This is aimed at identifying the most
epidemiologically important lineages of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of analysis, allowing
researchers to monitor the epidemic in a particular geographical region. For the new cluster
identified in South Africa in this study, we have assigned it the name 501Y.V2 until
PANGOLIN reflects the lineage in a future update.
Selection analysis
To identify which, if any, of the observed mutations in the spike protein was most likely to
increase viral fitness, we used the natural selection analysis of SARS-CoV-2 pipeline
(https://observablehq.com/@spond/revised-sars-cov-2-analytics-page). This pipeline
examines the entire global SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequence dataset for evidence of: (i)
polymorphisms having arisen in multiple epidemiologically unlinked lineages that have
statistical support for non-neutral evolution (Mixed Effects Model of Evolution, MEME)25,
(ii) sites where these polymorphisms have support for a greater than expected ratio of nonsynonymous:synonymous nucleotide substitution rates on internal branches of the
phylogenetic tree (Fixed Effects Likelihood, FEL)26, and (iii) whether these polymorphisms
have increased in frequency in the regions of the world where they have occurred.
Structural modelling
We modelled the spike protein based on the Protein Data Bank coordinate set 7a94, showing
the first step of the S protein trimer activation with one RBD domain in the up position,
bound to the hACE2 receptor27. We used the Pymol program (The PyMOL Molecular
Graphics System, Version 2.2.0, Schrödinger, LLC.) for visualization.

Results
Epidemic dynamics in South Africa
The second SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave in South Africa began around October 2020, just
weeks after a trough in daily recorded cases following the first peak (Fig. 1A)28. The
country’s estimated effective reproduction number, Re, increased to above 1 at the end of
October, indicating a growing epidemic, coinciding with a steady rise in daily cases. At the

peak of the national epidemic in mid-July there were over 13 000 confirmed cases per day
and almost 7000 excess deaths per week. The epidemiological profile in the three provinces
that are the focus of this analysis (EC, WC and KZN) were broadly similar, although WC had
an earlier and flatter peak in the first wave (Fig. 1B-D). At the end of the first wave in early
September, there had been over 10 000 excess deaths in EC (1510 per million population),
the highest for any province (Suppl Fig. S3). Although there was a plateau in cases following
the first wave, this was noticeably short in EC and by early October there was a second phase
of exponential growth, associated with an increase in deaths at a similar rate to the first wave
(Fig. 1B). PCR test positivity rate data at a local municipality level shows very high levels
(>20%) in Nelson Mandela Bay from mid-October and then rapidly rising levels in
surrounding areas through October and November (Suppl Fig. S4). The resurgence of the
daily case counts at an exponential rate happened later for WC and KZN than for EC (Fig.
1C-D). By early December, all three provinces were experiencing a second wave, and new
cases in WC had already surpassed the peak of the first wave.
Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis
The early and rapid resurgence of the epidemic in parts of the EC and WC prompted
intensification of genomic surveillance by the NGS-SA, including sampling in and around
Nelson Mandela Bay in EC, and in the neighbouring Garden Route district of WC (Suppl Fig.
S5.). We analysed 2589 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from South Africa collected between 5
March and 25 November 2020. We estimated preliminary maximum likelihood (ML) and
molecular clock phylogenies for a dataset containing as many global reference genomes (a
subset of the tree is shown in Fig. 2A). We identified a new monophyletic cluster (501Y.V2)
containing 190 sequences from samples collected between 15 October and 25 November in
KZN, EC and WC (Fig. 2B). By early November, the 501Y.V2 lineage had superseded the
three main South African lineages (B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 and C.1) that were circulating during
the first epidemic wave, and rapidly became the dominant lineage in samples from EC and
WC (Fig. 2C, Suppl Fig. S6,S7).
Spatiotemporal phylogeographic analysis suggests that the 501Y.V2 lineage emerged in early
August (early July – end August 2020, 95% highest posterior density) in Nelson Mandela
Bay. Initial spread to the Garden Route District of WC was then followed by more diffuse
spread from both of those areas to other regions of EC, and more recently to the City of Cape
Town and several locations in KZN (Fig. 2D).
Mutational profile
At the point of first sampling on 15 October this lineage had, in addition to D614G, five other
non-synonymous mutations in the spike protein, namely D80A, D215G, E484K, N501Y and
A701V (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3A, Suppl Fig. S8). Three further spike mutations emerged by the end
of November: L18F, R246I and K417N. We also observe a potential deletion of three amino
acids at L242_244L, seen in samples extracted and generated in various laboratories across
the network, however this site is still unresolved as it is disputed with a L242H mutation in
our sequences. Three of the spike mutations are at key residues in the RBD (N501Y, E484K
and K417N), three are in the N-terminal domain (L18F, D80A and D215G) and one is in loop
2 (A701V) (Suppl Fig. S9). While the variants appeared in a varying proportion of the
sampled genomes and showed changing frequency levels with time, the RBD mutations seem
to become fixed in our sampling set, present in almost all the samples, and consistently high

in frequency across time (Fig. 3A-B). Compared to the three largest lineages circulating in
SA previously, S501.V2 shows marked hypermutation both in the whole genomes and the
spike regions, including nonsynonymous variants leading to amino acid changes (Fig. 3C).
Selection analysis
We examined patterns of nucleotide variations and fluctuations in mutant frequencies at eight
polymorphic spike gene sites (Fig. 2B) to determine whether any of the observed
polymorphisms might be contributing to changes in viral fitness globally. For this analysis we
used 142 037 high quality sequences from GISAID sampled between 24 December 2019 and
14 November 2020, which represented 5964 unique spike haplotypes. The analysis indicated
that two of the three sites in RBD (E484 and N501) display a pattern of nucleotide variation
that is consistent with the site evolving under diversifying positive selection. The N501Y
polymorphism that first appears in our sequences sampled on 15 October shows indication of
positive selection on five global tree internal branches, with codon 501 of the spike gene
displaying a significant excess of non-synonymous substitutions globally (dN/dS > 1 on
internal branches, p=0.0011 by the FEL method), and mutant viruses encoding Y at this site
have rapidly increased in frequency in both the UK and in South Africa (Z-score = 11, trend
Jonckheere Terpstra non-parametric trend test). Similarly, at codon 484 there is indication of
positive selection on seven global tree internal branches, with an overall significant excess of
non-synonymous substitutions globally (p=0.015). There is currently no statistical evidence
of positive selection at K417. Outside RBD, sites L18 (p<0.001), D80 (p=0.0014), and D215
(p<0.001) show evidence of positive diversifying selection globally with the L18F mutation
also having increased in frequency in the regions where it has occurred (Z-score = 17).

Discussion
We describe and characterise a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage with multiple spike mutations that
emerged in a major metropolitan area in South Africa following the first wave of the
epidemic and then spread to multiple locations within two other neighbouring provinces. We
show that this lineage has rapidly become the dominant circulating genotype, at least in EC
and WC, at the time of a rapid resurgence in infections. Whilst the full significance of the
mutations is not yet clear, the genomic and epidemiological data suggest increased
transmissibility associated with the virus. These data highlight the urgent need to refocus the
public health response in South Africa on interrupting transmission, not only to reduce
hospitalisations and deaths but to limit the national and international spread of this lineage.
This new lineage has three mutations at key sites in the RBD (K417N, E484K and N501Y).
Two of these (E484K and N501Y) are within the receptor-binding motif (RBM), the main
functional motif that forms the interface with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. The
N501Y mutation has recently been identified in a new lineage in the United Kingdom
(B.1.1.7), with some preliminary evidence that it may be more transmissible29,30. N501 forms
part of the binding loop in the contact region of hACE2, forming a hydrogen bond with Y41
in hACE231-33. It also stabilises K353, one of the virus-binding hotspot residues on hACE234.
It is one of the key positions that differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV and
contributes to the enhanced binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for hACE231,34. The N501Y
mutation has been shown through deep mutation scanning and in a mouse model to enhance

binding affinity to hACE235,36. The E484K mutation is uncommon, being present in <0.02%
of sequences from outside South Africa. E484 is also in the RBM, and interacts with the K31
interaction hotspot residue of hACE2. There is some evidence that the E484K mutation may
modestly enhance binding affinity35. K417 is a unique hACE-2 interacting residue that forms
a salt bridge interaction across the central contact region with D30 of hACE231,32. This is the
most striking difference in the RBD-hACE2 complex between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV, and contributes to the enhanced binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to hACE231-33. Deep
mutational scanning suggests that the K417N mutation has minimal impact on binding
affinity to hACE235.
The spike RBD is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited during SARSCoV-2 infection37. NAbs to the RBD can be broadly divided into four main classes38. Of
these, class 1 and class 2 antibodies appear to be most frequently elicited during SARS-CoV2 infection, and their epitopes directly overlap the hACE2 binding site37. Class 1 antibodies
have a VH3-53 restricted mode of recognition centred around spike residue K417. The
K417N mutation would abolish key interactions with class 1 NAbs, and likely contributes
toward immune evasion at this site. The N501Y mutation may also have a role in escaping
class 1 NAbs, some of which make contact at this site. Class 2 antibodies bind to spike
residue E484, and the E484K mutation has been shown to confer resistance to NAbs in this
class, and to panels of convalescent sera, suggesting that E484 is a dominant neutralizing
epitope39-42.
One hypothesis for the emergence of this lineage, given the large number of mutations
relative to the background mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2, is that it may have arisen through
intra-host evolution in one or more individuals with prolonged viral replication43,44. This
hypothesis is supported by the long branch length connecting the lineage to the remaining
sequences in our phylogenetic tree (Suppl Fig. S10). The N501Y mutation is one of several
spike mutations that emerged in an immunocompromised individual in the US who had
prolonged viral replication for over 20 weeks44. In South Africa, the country with the world’s
biggest HIV epidemic, one concern has been the possibility of prolonged viral replication and
intra-host evolution in the context of HIV infection, although the limited evidence so far does
not suggest that HIV infection is associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication45. It
should be noted, however, that the observed diversity within this lineage cannot be explained
by a single long-term infection in one individual because the lineage contains circulating
intermediate mutants with subsets of the main mutations that characterise the lineage. If
evolution within long-term infections were the explanation for the evolution of this lineage
then one would need to invoke a transmission chain that passes through multiple individuals.
Further, antigenic evolution, even within non-immuno-suppressed individuals, could offer an
alternative explanation, given that several of the individual sites in spike appear to be under
selective pressure worldwide, and that several of the identified mutations have been found in
circulating lineages together.
Whilst we have yet to characterise how the mutations (particularly those in the RBM) affect
antigenicity, it is plausible that high levels of population immunity could have driven the
selection of this lineage. We have very limited SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence data from South
Africa to help understand the true extent of the epidemic. In studies using residual blood
samples from routine public sector antenatal and HIV care, seroprevalence in parts of the
City of Cape Town was estimated at approximately 40% in July-August, towards the end of

the first epidemic wave in that area46. We have shown that EC, and Nelson Mandela Bay in
particular, were worse affected than City of Cape Town in the first wave, and therefore we
believe that population immunity could have been sufficiently high in this region to
contribute to population-level selection. Whilst there have been no confirmed re-infections
(supported by whole genome sequencing) in South Africa, the true extent of re-infections is
unknown and this is now the focus of urgent investigation.
We are now working to understand the phenotypic impact of these SARS-CoV-2 mutations.
We are focusing on the following priority studies: we are performing infectivity assays and
neutralization assays to understand the effect of these mutations on ACE2 binding and NAb
binding; we are analysing clinical data from the three provinces to identify any signals
pointing to different disease progression or severity; we have intensified the genomic
surveillance in all provinces of South Africa; and we have stepped up monitoring and
surveillance for possible re-infections. Whilst the full implications of this new lineage in
South Africa are yet to be determined, these findings highlight the importance of coordinated
molecular surveillance systems in all parts of the world, to enable early detection and
characterisation of new lineages and to inform the global pandemic response.
