Abstract
Background: Performance of three automated commercial serological IgG-based assays was
investigated for assessing SARS-CoV-2 ever (past or current) infection in a population-based
sample in a high exposure setting.
Methods: PCR and serological testing was performed on 394 individuals.
Results: SARS-CoV-2-IgG seroprevalence was 42.9% (95% CI 38.1%-47.8%), 40.6% (95% CI
35.9%-45.5%), and 42.4% (95% CI 37.6%-47.3%) using the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys
assays, respectively. Between the three assays, overall, positive, and negative percent agreements
ranged between 93.2%-95.7%, 89.3%-92.8%, and 93.8%-97.8%, respectively; Cohen kappa
statistic ranged from 0.86-0.91; and 35 specimens (8.9%) showed discordant results. Among all
individuals, 12.5% (95% CI 9.6%-16.1%) had current infection, as assessed by PCR. Of these,
only 34.7% (95% CI 22.9%-48.7%) were seropositive by at least one assay. A total of 216
individuals (54.8%; 95% CI 49.9%-59.7%) had evidence of ever infection using antibody testing
and/or PCR during or prior to this study. Of these, only 78.2%, 74.1%, and 77.3% were
seropositive in the CL-900i, VidasIII, and Elecsys assays, respectively.
Conclusions: All three assays had comparable performance and excellent agreement, but missed
at least 20% of individuals with past or current infection. Commercial antibody assays can
substantially underestimate ever infection, more so when infection rates are high.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to be a global health challenge. As of November 22,
2020, the COVID-19 burden included 57.6 million confirmed cases and 1.3 million deaths
worldwide [1]. Meanwhile, the true extent of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and how far
different national populations are from herd immunity remain poorly understood. Commercial
serological assays are increasingly being used to address this gap in evidence. The extent to
which such assays can capture ever infection in a population remains to be elucidated.
Understanding who has been exposed and potentially acquired immunity against this virus may
help healthcare providers and public health stakeholders in establishing and implementing more
efficient and effective strategies and policies for managing the disease and economic burden
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Qatar experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with a high rate of laboratory-confirmed
infections at >60,000 infections per million population [2-4]. As part of the national response,
the public health authorities expanded serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for both
healthcare and research purposes. Three automated main serological testing platforms are being
used. The first is the Roche Elecsys® Anti SARS CoV 2 (Roche, Switzerland) [5] platform at
Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), the main public healthcare provider and the nationallydesignated provider for all COVID-19 healthcare needs. The second is the Mindray CL-900i
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., China) [6] platform at
Qatar University (QU), which is used for research purposes. The third is the BioMérieux
VidasIII (BioMérieux, Marcy-l’Etoile, France) [7] platform at QU, which is also being used for
research purposes.

To interpret the emerging results of serological testing and to inform the national response, this
study was conducted to compare the performance of these three assays and to assess the
implications for measuring SARS-CoV-2 ever infection. The novelty and strength of this study is
that it is conducted based on a population-based sample [8] in a setting at a high exposure to this
infection [2, 3, 9, 10].

Methods
Blood specimens were collected from 394 volunteering individuals between July 26 and
September 9, 2020, as a sub-study of a nationwide survey [8] assessing SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence (IgG antibodies) and current-infection prevalence (using polymerase chain
reaction [PCR] testing) in the wider population of craft and manual workers who constitute 60%
of the population of Qatar [11]. Informed by prior work [12, 13], a sample size of 400 was
estimated to be sufficient to ensure narrow confidence intervals for the Cohen’s kappa statistic,
but we were able to include and test only 394 specimens. The research work was approved by the
ethics review boards at HMC, QU, and Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar.
The automated serological testing was performed using the above indicated three commercial
assays. The Roche Elecsys® Anti SARS-CoV-2 (“Elecsys” in short form) assay, our reference
assasy, uses a recombinant protein representing the nucleocapsid (N) antigen for the
determination of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [5]. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 results were
generated following the manufacturer’s instructions (reactive: optical-density cutoff index ≥1.0
vs. non-reactive: cutoff index <1.0) [5, 14].

The Mindray CL-900i® anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (“CL-900i” in short form) assay uses
paramagnetic microplates coated with recombinant nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) antigens for
the determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies [6]. The analyzer automatically calculates
the analyte concentration of each serum specimen according to a master calibration curve, and
the results are shown in the units of U/mL. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 results were generated following
the manufacturer’s instructions (reactive: optical-density cutoff index ≥10.0 vs. non-reactive:
cutoff index <10.0) [6, 15].
The BioMérieux VidasIII assay (“VidasIII” in short form) uses a VIDASIII® analyzer for antiSARS-CoV-2 IgG detection through a two-step sandwich ELFA assay [7]. The IgG in the serum
specimen binds to a recombinant spike S1 sub-domain (containing the receptor-binding domain
[S1-RBD]) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus coated on a solid phase. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-human IgG are then added. The ﬂuorescence intensity generated by the substrate is then
measured at a wavelength of 450 nm. The intensity of the signal is proportional to the level of
IgG. The optical-density cutoff index was calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions
[7, 14]. The ratio between the relative ﬂuorescence value (RFV) measured in the specimen and
the RFV from the calibrator was interpreted as positive if the index value was ≥1.0 [7, 14].
All PCR testing was conducted at HMC Central Laboratory or at Sidra Medicine Laboratory,
following standardized protocols. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (Huachenyang
Technology, China) were collected and placed in Universal Transport Medium (UTM). Aliquots
of UTM were: extracted on the QIAsymphony platform (QIAGEN, USA) and tested with realtime reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) using the TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on an ABI 7500 FAST (ThermoFisher, USA); extracted using a
custom protocol [16] on a Hamilton Microlab STAR (Hamilton, USA) and tested using the

AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Kit (Bioneer, Korea) on an ABI 7500 FAST; or
loaded directly to a Roche cobas® 6800 system and assayed with the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Test
(Roche, Switzerland). The first assay targets the S, N, and ORF1ab regions of the virus; the
second targets the virus’ RdRp and E-gene regions; and the third targets the ORF1ab and E-gene
regions.
Results of the serological and PCR testing were subsequently linked to the HMC centralized and
standardized database comprising all SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing conducted in Qatar since the
start of the epidemic [2, 17]. The database also includes data on hospitalization and on the World
Health Organization (WHO) severity classification [18] for the hospitalized PCR-confirmed
infections.
Results from the three types of serological testing were cross-tabulated. Four concordance
metrics were estimated: overall, positive, and negative percent agreement, as well as Cohen’s
kappa statistic. The latter is a robust metric that measures the level of agreement, beyond chance,
between two diagnostic testing methods [19]. The kappa statistic ranges between 0 and 1; a value
≤0.40 indicates poor agreement, a value between 0.40 and 0.75 indicates fair/good agreement,
and a value ≥0.75 indicates excellent agreement [19]. Level of significance was established at
5%, and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported for each metric. A nonparametric statistical
method, Spearman correlation, was used to assess the correlation between the optical densities of
each pair of antibody assays. Calculations were conducted using Microsoft Excel.

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was estimated at 42.9% (169/394; 95% CI 38.1%-47.8%) using the
CL-900i assay, 40.6% (160/394; 95% CI 35.9%-45.5%) using the VidasIII assay, and 42.4%
(167/394; 95% CI 37.6%-47.3%) using the Elecsys assay. A total of 183 specimens were
seropositive in at least one of the assays for a total sample seroprevalence of 46.5% (183/394;
95% CI 41.6%-51.4%).
Table S1 shows the results of the serological and PCR testing for each of the 394 participants. A
total of 35 specimens showed discordant results between the three antibody assays (Table 1). Of
the 35 individuals with discordant antibody results, 9 were PCR-positive at the time of specimen
collection. Eleven specimens were seropositive using the CL-900i assay but seronegative using
the VidasIII and the Elecsys assays; among these, two were PCR-positive with cycle threshold
(Ct) values of 23.9 and 27.0. Five specimens were seropositive using the Elecsys assay but
seronegative using the VidasIII and the CL-900i assays; among these, one person was PCRpositive with a Ct value of 21.6. Two specimens were seropositive using the VidasIII assay but
seronegative using the CL-900i and the Elecsys assays; among these, one was PCR-positive with
a Ct value of 29.2.
The overall, positive, and negative percent agreements between the CL-900i and the Elecsys
assays were estimated at 93.4% (95% CI 90.5%-95.5%), 92.8% (95% CI 87.9%-95.8%), and
93.8% (95% CI 89.9%-96.3%), respectively (Table 2A). Cohen’s kappa statistic was estimated at
0.87 (95% CI 0.83-0.90), indicating excellent agreement between the two assays (Table 2A). The
Spearman correlation between the optical densities was at 0.751 (p-value<0.001) indicating
strong correlation.
The overall, positive, and negative percent agreements between the VidasIII and the Elecsys
assays were estimated at 95.7% (95% CI 93.2%-97.3%), 92.8% (95% CI 87.9%-95.8%), and

97.8% (95% CI 95.0%-99.1%), respectively (Table 2B). Cohen’s kappa statistic was estimated at
0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94), indicating excellent agreement between the two assays (Table 2B). The
Spearman correlation between the optical densities was at 0.824 (p-value<0.001) indicating
strong correlation.
The overall, positive, and negative percent agreements between the VidasIII and the CL-900i
assays were estimated at 93.2% (95% CI 90.2%-95.3%), 89.3% (95% CI 83.8%-93.2%), and
96.0% (95% CI 92.6%-97.9%), respectively (Table 2C). Cohen’s kappa statistic was estimated at
0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.90), indicating excellent agreement between the two assays (Table 2C). The
Spearman correlation between the optical densities was at 0.804 (p-value<0.001) indicating
strong correlation.
A total of 49 swabs were PCR-positive at the time of specimen collection during this study for a
current-infection prevalence of 12.5% (49/392; 95% CI 9.6%-16.1%)—two individuals declined
PCR testing (but not antibody testing) during this study. Figure 1A shows the distribution of the
PCR Ct values among those PCR-positive, indicating broad distribution suggestive of these
persons being diagnosed at the various stages of infection. The mean PCR Ct value was 25.8
with a standard deviation of 6.3.
Among all those PCR-positive at the time of specimen collection, 30.6% (15/49; 95% CI 19.5%44.5%) were seropositive in the CL-900i assay, 22.5% (11/49; 95% CI 13.0%-35.9%) were
seropositive in the VidasIII assay, 24.5% (12/49; 95% CI 14.6%-38.1%) were seropositive in the
Elecsys assay, and 34.7% (17/49; 95% CI 22.9%-48.7%) were seropositive in at least one of the
assays. Therefore, 32 individuals had a PCR-positive diagnosis at the time of specimen
collection, but were antibody-negative in all three assays.

Among all those seropositive in at least one of the assays, 9.3% were PCR-positive (17/183; 95%
CI 5.9%-14.4%) at the time of specimen collection. The mean PCR Ct value was 30.8 with a
standard deviation of 5.2, indicative of mostly non-recent infections (Figure 1B). Among all
those seronegative in all three assays, 15.2% were PCR-positive (32/211; 95% CI 11.0%-20.6%)
at the time of specimen collection. The mean PCR Ct value was 23.0 with a standard deviation of
5.1, indicative of mostly recent infections (Figure 1C).
Through linking with the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing database [17], and of the 394
participants, 4.3% (17/394; 95% CI 2.7%-6.8%) had a record of SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed
diagnosis prior to this study. All but one of these were antibody-positive by at least one of the
assays. The individual testing antibody-negative but had a prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was
diagnosed on July 23, 2020, that is four days prior to the antibody serological test date. This
individual declined PCR testing during this study and at the time of the serological test.
Of the 183 persons with an antibody-positive status in at least one assay, 16 persons had a
SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis prior to this study. Accordingly, the detection rate (the
percentage of those antibody-positive who had a prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis) was 8.7%
(16/183; 95% CI 5.5%-13.7%).
Based on the above, a total of 216 persons had a laboratory-confirmed infection at or prior to this
study; that is an antibody-positive result in at least one assay (183 cases), a PCR-positive
diagnosis prior to this study but with an antibody-negative status in all three assays (1 case), or a
PCR-positive diagnosis at the time of specimen collection during this study but with an antibodynegative status in all three assays (32 cases). Accordingly, the percentage of persons with
evidence of ever infection through either PCR or antibody testing was 54.8% (216/394; 95% CI
49.9%-59.7%). Moreover, only 78.2% of ever infections were antibody-positive by the CL-900i

assay (169/216; 95% CI 72.3%-83.2%), 74.1% by the VidasIII assay (160/216; 95% CI 67.8%79.5%), and 77.3% by the Elecsys assay (167/216; 95% CI 71.3%-82.4%).
Linking with the national COVID-19 hospitalization database [17] identified only one
laboratory-confirmed infection through this study to have progressed to severe disease per WHO
severity classification [18]. The person had also a diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, and
coronary artery disease. This person was diagnosed PCR-positive at time of specimen collection,
was seronegative in the CL-900i and the VidasIII assays, but was seropositive in the Elecsys
assay. No infection was critical per WHO severity classification [18] and no COVID-19 death
was reported for any of the study participants.

Discussion
A primary finding of this study is that all three antibody assays had comparable performance and
excellent agreement. This positive finding, however, conceals important shortcomings about the
use and performance of commercial antibody assays in assessing ever infection with SARS-CoV2 in population-based surveys, especially at times of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence, as is the case
at present globally.
The first shortcoming is that each of these three assays missed ≥69% of those who were PCRpositive at the time of specimen collection. This finding is explained in large part by the 1-4
weeks delay in development of detectable antibodies after acquiring the infection [20, 21]. This
explanation is supported by the low PCR Ct value among those PCR-positive but antibodynegative (Figure 1C), which indicates recency of infection. At the time of the study and in the
population being studied, the outbreak was advancing, so there was a significant proportion of

new infections, making the serology assay less useful for estimating population prevalence of
ever infection. It is unknown whether the lower sensitivity could have been due in part also to
commercial assay development preferentially opting to maximize the specificity of the assay, to
avoid a false positive diagnosis with its clinical implications, but at the expense of the sensitivity
of the assay.
The second shortcoming is that each of these three assays also missed other individuals with
evidence of ever infection. Despite excellent agreement overall, nearly 10% of the total sample
still showed discordant results between the three antibody assays. Differences in the sensitivity
of the assays to diagnose recent infection explains only partially these discordant results. Indeed,
most (74.3%) of these persons with discordant results were PCR-negative at the time of
specimen collection (Table 1), and thus less likely to have had a recent infection. The extent to
which false positivity may explain some of these discordant results is unknown, but the three
manufacturers reported essentially perfect specificity for each of these assays [5, 7, 22, 23].
As a consequence of these findings, the use of any one of these antibody assays to assess ever
infection in a population-based sample, especially at the times of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence,
will substantially underestimate the ever infection prevalence in the sample. In the sample in the
present study, at least 20% of ever infections were missed. A solution to this challenge is to
combine PCR data and serology data together, or that the serology data cannot be adequately
interpreted without knowledge of the PCR positivity data, or that serology is less useful when the
epidemiology is rapidly changing. With the global pandemic continuing at high SARS-CoV-2
incidence, this finding suggests that ever infection in populations is possibly substantially higher
than is currently believed.

This study has some limitations. Two out of the 394 participants included in the study declined
PCR testing (but not serological testing) at time of specimen collection. The performance of
these antibody assays was compared to each other (and to PCR testing), but not to a gold
standard test of seropositivity, as such a test was not available to study investigators. Therefore,
we were unable to measure ever infection prevalence to a gold standard, and use this to compare
the performance of each assay to the gold standard, nor to assess the sensitivity and specificity of
each assay in the study sample. The specificity of the Elecsys assay has previously been reported
to be 99.98% and the sensitivity to be 98.80% on day 14 after PCR diagnosis [5]. A validation
study by Public Health England reported a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 83.9% for the
same assay [22]. As for the remaining assays, specificity and sensitivity were reported at 94.9%
and 82.2%, respectively, for the CL-900i assay [23], and at 99.9% and 88.6%, respectively, for
the VidasIII assay [7].
In conclusion, all three assays had comparable performance and excellent agreement when used
in a high SARS-CoV-2 exposure setting, but still missed at least 20% of cases with laboratoryconfirmed evidence of ever infection. This suggests that current growing use of commercial
antibody assays to assess ever infection in population-based surveys, especially at times of high
SARS-CoV-2 incidence when many infections are recent, is likely to substantially underestimate
actual infection exposure. The findings demonstrate further the need to interpret the serology
testing together with PCR testing.
