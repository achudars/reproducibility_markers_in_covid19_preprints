Abstract
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, institutions of higher education in almost every nation closed in the
first half of 2020. University administrators are now facing decisions about if and how to safely return
students, staff and faculty to campus. To provide a framework to evaluate various strategies, we developed a
susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type deterministic compartmental transmission model of
SARS-CoV-2 among students, staff and faculty. Our goals were to support the immediate pandemic planning
at our own university, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar
academic institutions. We parameterized the model for our institution, Emory University, a medium-size
private university in Atlanta, Georgia. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening
(regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explore a range of screening and testing
frequencies and perform a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of input parameters. We find that monthly and
weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 30% and 81% in students, respectively, while testing
with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay results in an 92%, 85% and 73% reduction in cumulative incidence in students
over the semester, respectively. Smaller reductions are observed among staff and faculty. A testing strategy
requires far fewer diagnostic assays to be implemented than a screening assay. Our intervention model is
conservative in that we assume a fairly high reproductive number. We find that community-introduction of
SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus may be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and
quarantine, but that cases, hospitalization, and (in some scenarios) deaths may still occur. In addition to
estimating health impacts, this model can help to predict the resource requirements in terms of diagnostic
capacity and isolation/quarantine facilities associated with different strategies.

Background
In an unprecedented response to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools (including institutions of higher
education) in almost every nation closed in the first half of 2020.(1) For boarding institutions like universities,
this involved both transitioning classes into online teaching as well as closing dormitories by sending students
off-campus. School closure as a non-pharmaceutical intervention has been aimed at reducing contact among
students, family members, teachers, and school staff.(2) It is thought to be an effective means of reducing
disease transmission based on the understanding that younger people are important in transmission of
respiratory viruses, like influenza. Closure of schools early in a pandemic is thought to be more impactful
than delayed closing.(2) According to UNESCO, approximately 70% of the global student population has
been affected, with closures of pre-school, primary, secondary, and higher education institutions.(1) Since
SARS-CoV-2 infections are particularity severe among older adults while younger people still get infected and
transmit,(3) university populations are unique in these degree of mixing across these age groups. Prior to the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2, contact data on transmission of influenza, and other respiratory virus, provided
the basis of current recommendations. Universities are important and unique in that they are frequently
residential, involve students traveling long distances to attend, and are assets to their regional economies.
University administrators are now facing decisions regarding if and how to safely return students, staff and
faculty to campus. As of the end of May 2020, approximately two-thirds of US universities are planning for
in-person instruction for Fall 2020.(4) Universities considering campus re-opening need to estimate the
resources necessary to interrupt and mitigate on-campus transmission by projecting the number of possible
cases, needs for screening and testing, and boarding requirements for persons needing isolation and
quarantine. To provide a framework to evaluate these questions, we developed a susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) type of deterministic compartmental model. This model captures the
transmission process and can therefore estimate the direct and indirect (transmission-mediated) effects of
control strategies. For example, through model simulations, we estimated how testing and identifying SARSCoV-2 infected students results in them being isolated, their contacts being quarantined, as well as all the
infections averted by preventing the chains of transmission that would have otherwise occurred. Our goals
were to support the immediate pandemic planning at our own university and to provide a flexible modeling
framework to inform the efforts at similar academic institutions.
Methods
We developed a dynamic model of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among students, staff and faculty. We
parameterized the model for our institution, Emory University, a medium-size private university in Atlanta,
Georgia (numbers are for the main campus only). We expect the model could be applicable to other colleges
and universities and therefore provide a public web-interface where key initial conditions and model
parameters, such as student and staff population sizes can be varied (https://epimodel.shinyapps.io/coviduniversity/). The main features and assumptions are described in the following sections. Table 1 provides a
full list of all parameter values, the model equations are shown in the appendix.
Population Structure and Transmission
We modeled three distinct population groups with different degrees of interactions among them: students
living on campus; students living off campus; and staff and faculty. We assume that staff/faculty can be
infected by students and can infect other staff/faculty, with a reproduction number (before NPI) of 0.5.
Student-to-student interactions leads to transmission at a higher rate, we assume a reproduction number
(before NPI) of 2. We assume that students living on campus have a further increased transmission potential
to other on-campus students, because congregate living is typical on most college campuses. We therefore
assume those students infect on average 1 additional on-campus students.
Universities are planning an array of measures to limit transmission on campus. These may include maskwearing; other personal protective equipment; smaller class sizes; staggered class times; enhanced cleaning
protocols; enhanced hygiene; canceling large social gatherings; fewer students living in dorms and restricting
off-campus movements. We lack data on the efficacy of all these interventions, especially in this specific

population, but we assume that they will have an effect on transmission. We parameterize these nonpharmaceutical controls based on a systematic review of the effect of social distancing and face coverings
(5)(and assume 50% compliance), and explore a range of values around this parameter.
Staff and faculty had a higher risk of severe illness and death (given infection) than students, based on
accumulating evidence of age-differences in the case-fatality rate,(6) and then standardized using the student
and staff/faculty age-structure at our institution. [For a full list of parameter values, see Table 1.] We further
assume that a fraction of cases is asymptomatic and that, the probability of symptoms is greater for
staff/faculty given their older age distribution than students. We assumed that asymptomatic infected persons
are as infectious as those with symptoms; this assumption may overestimate the real transmission rate in this
group.(7) We assume that infectiousness begins on the third day after infection; this latent period is shorter
than the incubation period(8) to represent pre-symptomatic transmission.
We do not track transmission in the wider community, aside from incorporating a daily rate of introduction
of virus onto campus from the community. In order to capture external infection from non-university
sources, we modeled a constant daily rate of infection being introduced on campus. In our model
parameterization, this is based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Fulton and Dekalb Counties that surround
our institution in early June (around 100 per day) and the combined population of the two counties.(9) We
further assume that infection incidence is ten-times that of reported cases.(7) The model runs for a semester
from the day classes start (August 26) to the end of term (December 19), or 116 days. We did not assume
reduced transmission over traditional Fall or Thanksgiving breaks or consider alternative schedules.
Intervention Design
In the model, control is initiated by SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Infected persons can be identified by reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through either testing or screening, defined as follows.
Screening is a strategy in which students, staff, and faculty are tested at a given frequency ranging from weekly
to once per semester regardless of the presence of symptoms. Testing is a strategy whereby symptomatic
students, staff, and faculty present for clinical care and are tested using RT-PCR. We assume a background
level of persons with influenza-like symptoms caused by infections other than SARS-CoV-2 ,(10,11) who will
test negative. Those with COVID-19 who test positive are immediately isolated. However, we assume that
the diagnostic has imperfect sensitivity that varies based on what date of illness the test is performed.(12)
There is evidence that PCR sensitivity varies over the course of infection, reaching a peak around day 7 of
infection (or day 4 of infectiousness), then declines again. Therefore, we examined the impact of variation in
the testing interval, defined as the average lag time between symptom onset and quarantine. Because
infectiousness begins one day before symptom onset in the model, we simulated testing intervals ranging
from a two -day to a one-week test delay. These testing scenarios are in the absence of any screening to
isolate the causal effects of this more intensive intervention.
Following both screening and testing, those testing positive for COVID-19 were immediately isolated. Case
isolation in the model mechanistically involved a complete reduction in their contact rate for the duration of
infection. Positive test results also lead to contact tracing. Contact tracing is conducted by assuming public
health authorities could elicit NA contacts per case detected with 75% of those successfully traced and
quarantined. Quarantine, like isolation, was modeled as a complete reduction in the contact rate for the
duration of infection. Some of those quarantined contacts might have been incubating but are now no longer
able to infect since they are under quarantine.

Figure 1. Schematic of A) Disease Structure and B) Student and Staff/Faculty Transmission Pathways.
Parameterization and Analysis
In our base models, we simulated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and interventions for the Fall 2020 semester.
Our main base model assumed NPI interventions but no screening or testing based-control. Counterfactual
scenarios then varied the screening and testing rates, and the completeness of contact tracing. Our primary
outcomes were both active cases per day and cumulative cases across the semester. The model tracked both
total cases in each campus group (students versus staff/faculty) as well as severe cases and COVID-related
mortality.
Given uncertainty in model parameters, we performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to determine the
range of credible outcomes. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, we take 1,000 parameter draws using Latin
Hypercube Sampling from the distributions in Table 1 and report the 2.5th and 97.5th centile of those runs
(Appendix II). We use partial rank correlation coefficient to determine how much the modeled variation in
cumulative incidence among students and faculty/staff depends on specific random parameters.
The model was built and simulated in the EpiModel package in the R statistical computing platform (13); the
LHS package was used to perform Latin Hypercube Sampling. We also built an interactive web app for
model exploration using the R Shiny framework. It can be accessed at https://epimodel.shinyapps.io/coviduniversity/.
Results
We start by simulating transmission on campus (Figure 2) in which no diagnostic control measures are in
place (no testing, isolation, contact tracing, or quarantine). With R0 of 3.5 for on-campus student and 2.5 for
off-campus, case prevalence peaks at 807 cases (Range, 2.5th to 97.5th centiles: 263 to 1417) per day among
students and 241 cases per day among staff/faculty (76 to 551), resulting in a cumulative of4150 (2449 to
5722) and 1744 (784 to 3176) cases at the end of the semester in a population of about 15,000 each. With our
baseline levels of facemask and social distancing efficacy (70%) but with no diagnostics, we estimate case
prevalence peaks at 413 (77-956) per day among students and 102 (31-285) cases per day among staff/faculty,
resulting in a cumulative of 3056 (923-4840) student cases and 1046 (413-2078) staff cases at the end of the
semester. Note that this number of symptomatic cases is substantially lower than the number of infections
since we assume that 35% (27 to 43%) of infected students and 51% (41 to 59%) of infected staff are
symptomatic, given infection.(15) We use this scenario as the baseline counterfactual for all subsequent
comparisons.

Figure 2. Effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (with no testing and screening) on COVID-19
prevalence among students and faculty.
We next explored a wide range of screening intervals, from weekly to once during the semester (Figure 3).
One-time screening, whereby the population is tested on average once during the 4-month semester, reduced
cumulative student incidence overall by 8%; monthly and weekly screening reduced cumulative student
incidence by 30% and 81% respectively. For staff and faculty, one-time screening reduced cumulative
incidence by 9%; monthly and weekly screening reduce cumulative incidence by 29% and 65% respectively.
For students, the cumulative incidence ranged from 583 (184-1595) with weekly screening to 2814 (809-4584)
with one-time screening. For staff/faculty, the cumulative incidence ranged from 366 (144-751) with weekly
screening to 950 (381-1895) with one-time screening.

Figure 3. Impact of Screening Frequency on Projected Covid-19 Daily and Cumulative Incidence.
We then consider a testing-only strategy, which also includes contact tracing and quarantine. Assuming
different delays between symptom-onset and receiving the tests, results are shown in Figure 4. We again plot
the total number of cases among students and staff, with other parameter values at their base values. Here,
with week-delayed testing (the least optimistic scenario), the expected cumulative incidence would be 826
(233-1792) for students and 503 (206-987) for staff/faculty. With a four-day delay testing interval, the
expected cumulative incidence would be 467 (155-1092) for students and 503 (206-987) for staff/faculty.
With a two-day delay testing interval, the expected cumulative incidence would be 250 (91-523) for students
and 354 (144-700) for staff/faculty. These scenarios represent a 73%, 85% and 92% reduction in cumulative
incidence over the semester among students and a 52%, 60% and 66% reduction in cumulative incidence
among staff & faculty. Figure 3 also shows the general relationship between ‚Äúcontact tracing‚Äù success and
cumulative incidence assuming either a 2-day, 4-day, or 7-day delay in testing/quarantine following
symptoms. Although the testing interval can reduce the cumulative incidence, the greater impact of this
testing scenario is achieved by the number of contacts reached.

Figure 4. Impact of testing, contact tracing and quarantine at a range of testing delay intervals. Daily and
cumulative Covid-19 incidence on university campus
In the final scenarios, we combined the testing and screening rates under different assumptions of contact
tracing related to testing (Figure 5). Our model scenarios below varied the interval for screening between 1
week (7 days) and 1 semester (120 days) and testing at2-, 4- and 7-day delay, with the efficacy of contact
tracing ranging from 0, 50% and 100%. These figure panels show cumulative incidence at the end of the
semester for students only. When combined with testing, screening generally has little effect unless it is
performed at least monthly.

Discussion
We find that unmitigated transmission of Covid-19 in a population of around 30,000 staff, faculty and
students would lead to thousands of illnesses, many hospitalizations and likely deaths in this population,
which is clearly an unacceptable outcome by administrators and the university community. Combined with
measures to reduce transmission, a testing strategy whereby symptomatic students, staff and faculty are
identified, administered viral testing, and isolated may be effective at controlling transmission. We find that

the success of this strategy relies on contact tracing and quarantining most contacts of infected individuals.
Screening would have to be performed at least monthly to have much of an impact on the course of the
outbreak on campus and increases the sample collection and assay requirements considerably. However,
because we assume the campus community is not a closed population and that there is an ongoing risk of
importation of virus, there are considerable numbers of cases even under the most optimistic scenario, which
therefore requires substantial resources. Overall, we recommend that these results be interpreted qualitatively,
since there is considerable uncertainty in these projections stemming from lack of precision of parameter
inputs (e.g. true R0 in this population).
There are a number of limitations to this modeling analysis, which we outline here. First, we lack empirical
data about the efficacy of any prevention and control measures aside from testing that are implemented on
campus. Smaller class sizes, staggered class times, use of face coverings, use of other protective equipment
and general behavior change are not separately accommodated in this model.(5) If such data become available
in campus population or ones that can serve as a good proxy, model parameters can be refined. Moving more
students to off-campus housing has little effect on our projections because we make the assumption that
transmission on-campus (R0 = 3.5) is only moderately higher than off campus (R0 = 2.5). This assumption is
based on risk factor data on influenza-like illness among students during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, but if
more data become available, we could revisit this assumption.(17) In our model, the campus outbreak cannot
go extinct because we assume a constant rate of introduction from the community. Depending on levels of
student, staff and faculty behavior off-campus and the general prevalence in the surrounding community
(Atlanta metro area in our model), this could be an under- or overestimate of risk. We have not explicitly
included a scenario in which all or a subset of students (e.g., those residing on campus) are screened upon
return to campus. Given our assumptions that student prevalence is the same as among the general
population, screening on return would have limited effect, but would increase requirements by ~4,500 to
15,000 tests, depending on the breadth of testing of the student body. Finally, we have not included seasonal
effects whereby virus becomes more transmissible in Fall or alternative semester dates (e.g., end of classes at
Thanksgiving break) whereby the period of campus transmission is reduced.
While we present numerical results for our univerity at a specific point in time, the model can be reparameterized for other institutions and can be updated as the epidemiolgical situation shifts. We updated the
model a number of times in discussions with our university leadership. Results from this framework have
been influential in their ongoing decision-making. Community risk is a parameter that we updated as the local
area‚Äôs incidence increased and is sure to change over time and will vary from place to place. Local data on
reported incidence and estimates of under-reporting should be used to update this value. Similarly, population
immunty will increase as the pandemic progresses. Sero-survey data can inform the proportion of the
universiy community that is immune upon campus opening.
In conclusion, we present a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control to assist universities in planning
potential impacts and resource needs. Our model is conservative in that we assume a high reproductive
number that is not reduced through non-pharmaceutical interventions. Despite this, we find that communityintroduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be controlled with effective testing, isolation,
contract tracing and quarantine, consistent with observations that this strategy has been successful in the
general population where implemented properly (e.g. South Korea).(18) The results of this model simulation
approach have been influential in Emory University‚Äôs decision to open in Fall 2020. The University will
implement a comprehensive testing strategy and will shorten the semester with an early start, with no breaks
in order to end by Thanksgiving, amongst a number of other strategies to suppress transmission.(19)
