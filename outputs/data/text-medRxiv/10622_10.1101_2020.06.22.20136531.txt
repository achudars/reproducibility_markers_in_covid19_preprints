Abstract
BACKGROUND
Remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, has been
identified as a candidate for COVID-19 treatment. However, the therapeutic effect of
remdesivir is controversial.
METHODS
We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, from inception to June 11, 2020 for randomized controlled trials on the clinical
efficacy of remdesivir. The main outcomes were discharge rate, mortality, and
adverse events. This study is registered at INPLASY (INPLASY202060046).
RESULTS
Data of 1075 subjects showed that remdesivir significantly increased the discharge
rate of patients with COVID-19 compared with the placebo (50.4% vs. 45.29%;
relative risk [RR] 1.19 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–1.34], I2 = 0.0%, P =
0.754). It also significantly decreased mortality (8.18% vs. 12.70%; RR 0.64 [95% CI,
0.44–0.92], I2 = 45.7%, P = 0.175) compared to the placebo. Data of 1296 subjects
showed that remdesivir significantly decreased the occurrence of serious adverse
events (RR 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63–0.94], I2 = 0.0%, P = 0.716).
CONCLUSION
Remdesivir is efficacious and safe for the treatment of COVID-19.

In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, several cases of pneumonia were caused by a
novel

coronavirus,

the severe

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

2

(SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) officially designated this new
disease as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1,2 COVID-19 is declared a global
pandemic, and has led to over 8.5 million infections and 452 thousand deaths up to
now. Due to the lack of a specific antiviral agent that targets the virus, COVID-19
pandemic remains largely uncontrolled with high morbidity and mortality, posing a
huge challenge globally.3 Therefore, it is of great importance to explore safe and
effective treatment options.
Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase and may cause premature RNA-chain termination. It has a broad antiviral
spectrum that covers pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses.
Furthermore, remdesivir plays an important role in the treatment of Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV).4 Interestingly, remdesivir is effective in
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 growth in vitro;5 it has reportedly reduced viral load in the
lungs and improved disease symptoms in a mouse model of SARS-CoV.6 It has been
identified by the WHO as the most promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment
of

COVID-19.7

However,

since

the

therapeutic

effect

of

remdesivir

is

controversial,7-10 we aimed to evaluate clinically meaningful evidence on its efficacy
and safety in the treatment of COVID-19 via an analysis of pooled randomized
controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods
SEARCH STRATEGY AND CRITERIA
We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials from their inception to June 11, 2020, to identify RCTs on
remdesivir treatment for COVID-19, with no restrictions on publication type or
language. Our main search keywords were “coronavirus disease 2019,” “COVID-19,”
“novel coronavirus 2019,” “2019 novel coronavirus,” “severe acute respiratory
syndrome-corona

virus-2,”

“SARS-CoV-2,”

“remdesivir,”

“gs

5734,”

and

“randomized controlled trial” (Appendix 1). Studies were considered eligible if they
met the following criteria: (1) presented original data from a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial; (2) used two comparator groups with one
receiving remdesivir and the other receiving a placebo; (3) reported the number of
patients discharged from hospital, death, and adverse events as outcomes; and (4) had
adequate data to be pooled for the analysis. Two authors (TZW and ZY)
independently selected eligible articles. First, titles and abstracts were evaluated to
exclude non-relevant articles. Then, full text was read to confirm whether studies
conformed to our inclusion criteria. Disputes between the two authors were resolved
by consensus. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad scoring
system,11 in which the maximum score is 5. We defined high quality as a Jadad score
of ≥3.0.

Two authors (ZY and TZW) extracted all data. For each study, we recorded the
following variables: first author’s last name, publication year, sample size,
participants’ sex and age, and patient distribution on a six-category scale (Appendix 2)
at enrollment and at 15 ± 2 days after enrollment, adverse events, and outcome
measurements related to risk estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Pre-specified endpoints included discharge and death as primary endpoints with
adverse events including anemia, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, acute
kidney injury, septic shock, and cardiac arrest as key secondary endpoints. Each
outcome was assessed according to the definitions reported in the study protocols. We
conducted a pooled analysis to measure the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for
COVID-19 treatment. We pooled the risk ratios (RR) and 95% CI values calculated
using chi-squared (χ2) tests. Cochran Q and I2 statistics were used to evaluate
statistical heterogeneity.12 When the p-value was >0.1 and the I2 value was <50%, a
fixed-effects model13 was used to estimate the overall summary effect sizes. When
either the p-value was <0.1 or the I2 value was >50%, the data were considered to be
heterogeneous, and a random-effects model14 was applied to determine the overall
summary effect sizes. STATA software v12.0 (College Station, TX, USA) was used
to analyze the data.

Results
We found 87 relevant studies through our initial search. After removing 10 duplicate
articles and 21 reviews, 56 remained. Eventually, two studies7-8 were finally included
in our analysis after screening titles and abstracts. No eligible studies were identified
by screening the bibliographies of the relevant studies (Figure 1). According to the
Jadad scale, two studies were of high quality with scores of 5 (Table 1). A total of
1299 patients with COVID-19 randomly allocated to a group treated with remdesivir
(n = 699) or group treated with placebo (n = 600) were included in our analysis. The
distribution of patients based on a six-category scale at enrollment are shown in Table
1, Figure 2A, and Figure 2B. Among the included patients, the average age was over
50 years and number of men exceeded that of women. Details of the characteristics of
the studies are summarized in Table 1.
First, among 1075 patients with COVID-19, patients in the remdesivir group had
a higher rate of discharge and lower mortality than patients in the placebo group
(50.43% vs. 45.29% and 8.18% vs. 12.70%, respectively) (Figure 2C, 2D). The
pooled analysis indicated that remdesivir increased the discharge rate (RR, 1.19 [95%
CI, 1.05–1.34]; P = 0·754, I2 = 0·0%) (Figure 2E) and decreased mortality (RR, 0.64
[95% CI, 0.44–0.92]; P = 0.175, I2 = 45.7%) (Figure 2F) in patients with COVID-19
compared with the placebo.
Second, the data of 1296 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed to
explore the association between remdesivir treatment and adverse events. The

analysis suggested that remdesivir decreased the occurrence of serious adverse events
(RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63–0.94]; p = 0.716, I2 = 0.0%) (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
remdesivir showed a tendency to reduce non-serious adverse events, although the
tendency was not statistically significant (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.80–1.06]; p = 0.225, I2
= 32.0%) (Figure 3B).
Additionally, when anemia, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, deep vein
thrombosis, acute kidney injury, and cardiac arrest were regarded as endpoints,
remdesivir was associated with decreased risk of all of them, except cardiac arrest,
although these differences were not statistically significant (Figure 3C-3H).
Discussion
There is an urgent need for effective therapies for COVID-19. Remdesivir is a
nucleotide analog prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity and is currently
being investigated in multiple COVID-19 clinical trials.15 Our analysis showed that
remdesivir was effective and safe in treating patients with COVID-19.
First, our analysis indicated that remdesivir significantly increased the discharge
rate of patients with COVID-19 at approximately 15 days (Figure 2A, 2B), indicative
of its efficacy. Remdesivir has been reported to have potential benefits in severely ill
patients with COVID-19.10,16-17 However, an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial
in patients with severe COVID-19 presented a different result, that is, a
non-significant difference between 5- and 10-day courses of remdesivir.9 Based on
RCTs, Beigel et al. reported that patients treated with remdesivir had a shorter

recovery time than those treated with placebo (median 11 days, compared to 15 days;
RR for recovery, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12–1.55; p < 0.001).8 A more rapid clinical
improvement within 10 days was observed in patients receiving remdesivir compared
to those receiving placebo (median 18·0 days [IQR 12.0–28.0] vs. 23.0 days
[15.0–28.0]; HR 1.52 [0.95–2.43], P > 0.05).7 In our study, the discharge rate was
used to more intuitively reflect the patient’s recovery or clinical improvement. The
comprehensive analysis suggested that regardless of the proportion of patients in the
initial six-category scale, the discharge rate in the remdesivir group was also higher
than that in the placebo group, 50.43% vs. 45.29% (Table 1, Figure 2A, B). We
believe that this result is more convincing than that presented by any single study.
Second, our results indicated that remdesivir significantly decreased the mortality
of patients with COVID-19 (Figure 2C, 2D, 2F). Remdesivir has been shown to be
effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses in an animal model;18
therefore, many studies have been conducted to test whether remdesivir can reduce
mortality in patients with COVID-19. Two recent studies reported that remdesivir
reduces mortality compared with placebo in patients with COVID-19 (8.0% vs. 11.6%
and 7.1% vs. 11.9%),8,19 and this was consistent with our results (8.2% vs. 12.7%,
Figure 2C, 2D). Furthermore, the mortality risk was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.47–1.04) in
Beigel’s study,8 which presented results similar to ours (RR 0.64 [95% CI 0.44–0.92]);
however, our result was statistically significant (Figure 2F). A study in China reported
a different conclusion, with no difference in mortality between patients treated with

remdesivir and placebo at 7, 14, and 28 days (6.5% vs. 5.2%, 9.8% vs. 9.0%, and 14.7%
vs. 13.0%, respectively).7 However, its incomplete enrolment, owing to a lack of
eligible patients and low persuasiveness, owing to its 2:1 randomization, may have
made the experiment statistically inadequate. Because our study combined two
high-quality randomized case-control studies, we believe that our results are more
convincing. And previous vivo and vitro experiment also both supported our results.
Remdesivir was found to prevent COVID-19 infection in vitro experiments at
extremely low concentrations. 5 At the same time, a recent study found that remdesivir
had clinical effect in rhesus monkeys infected with COVID-19: Rhesus monkeys
treated early with reddisivir had less lung damage, no signs of respiratory infection,
and less lower respiratory viral load than controls. 15
Third, our analysis indicated that remdesivir significantly decreased the risk of
serious adverse events (Figure 3A) with a tendency to reduce the risk of non-serious
adverse events (Figure 3B). Further evaluation of adverse events such as anemia,
septic shock, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and acute kidney injury,
showed similar trends. These data suggest that remdesivir is safe to be used for the
treatment of COVID-19.
Our analysis had some limitations. First, the small number of studies that were
included greatly weakened the reliability of our results. Second, the RR values
calculated were unadjusted owing to a lack of raw data, which may lead to bias. Third,
the overall sample size is not large enough, which limits statistical power. Thus,

larger-scale RCTs are needed, and our pooled analysis findings should be interpreted
with caution. However, we will update the analysis as new studies that meet inclusion
criteria emerge.
Overall, this analysis demonstrated that remdesivir significantly increased the
recovery rate, decreased mortality, and decreased the risk of serious adverse events.
Our findings highlight the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the treatment of
COVID-19, which should be incorporated into routine therapy. Furthermore, this
analysis also suggests that larger cohorts and randomized controlled trials are needed
to more thoroughly investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of remdesivir for
COVID-19.
