Abstract
Background: Options to increase the ease of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune
response are needed. Self-collection of diagnostic specimens at home offers an avenue to allow
people to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or immune response without traveling to a clinic or
laboratory. Before this study, survey respondents indicated willingness to self-collect specimens
for COVID-related tests, but hypothetical willingness can differ from post-collection acceptability
after participants collect specimens.
Methods: 153 US adults were enrolled in a study of the willingness and feasibility of patients to
self-collect three diagnostic specimens (saliva, oropharyngeal swab (OPS) and dried blood spot
(DBS) card) while observed by a clinician through a telehealth session. After the specimens
were collected, 148 participants participated in a survey about the acceptability of the collection,
packing and shipping process, and their confidence in the samples collected for COVID-related
laboratory testing.
Results: A large majority of participants (>84%) reported that collecting, packing and shipping
of saliva, OPS, and DBS specimens were acceptable. Nearly nine in 10 (87%) reported being
confident or very confident that the specimens they collected were sufficient for laboratory
analysis. There were no differences in acceptability for any specimen type, packing and
shipping, or confidence in samples by gender, age, race/ethnicity, or educational level.
Conclusions: Self-collection of specimens for SARS-CoV-2 testing and preparing and shipping
specimens for analysis were acceptable in a diverse group of US adults. Further refinement of
materials and instructions to support self-collection of saliva, OPS and DBS specimens for
COVID-related testing is needed.
Trial registration: No intervention was tested in this study

Background

The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in explosive patterns of transmission in most
countries [1,2]. Control programs, where they have been successful, have relied largely on a
combination of testing people for SARS-CoV-2 infection, quarantine, and social distancing [3].
The United States, which as of this writing comprises 4.25% of the world’s population and
accounts for 31% of global diagnoses of COVID-19 disease, has struggled to launch an
effective screening program for the virus [4]. After early failures of government-developed
testing kits [5], private laboratories were allowed more flexibility to expand testing platforms [6].
However, overall testing capacity remains well below the levels needed to inform decisions
about relaxing social distancing programs: public health officials estimate that a US national
capacity of at least 1 million tests per week is required [7], and current capacity is less than a
quarter of that for PCR testing [8].
There are a number of barriers to expanding testing [9]. Since the beginning of the epidemic,
barriers have included supply chain constraints for rigid swabs [10], shortages of personal
protective equipment needed for healthcare workers collecting invasive specimens [11], limited
transport media for swab-based specimens, and limited laboratory reagents for testing
specimens [6]. Further, there is limited willingness of people to travel into a laboratory or clinic
to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection [12]. Responding to these challenges calls for the
development of alternative specimen collection processes that produce high-quality specimens,
are acceptable to a broad segment of the population for screening purposes (i.e., not only for
diagnostic testing of those suspected of having COVID-19), and minimize the need for personal
protective equipment (PPE) for collection.

The iCollect study recruited 159 US adults for a study of the acceptability and sufficiency of athome self-collected samples for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and immune response testing. We have

previously documented the study protocol [9] and demonstrated that specimens collected at
home are considered suitable by telehealth clinicians and sufficient by laboratorians [13]. After
participants self-collected specimens, we asked them to rate the acceptability of the selfcollection process and of packaging and shipping specimens, and we asked participants for
recommendations on how to improve the specimen self-collection process. Here, we describe
the participant-reported acceptability of self-specimen collection and participant suggestions to
improve the self-collection and shipping process.

Methods

The methods for the iCollect study have been previously described [9]. Briefly, participants were
recruited from databases of participants in previous Emory University studies who had agreed to
be recontacted for future research studies and from networks of symptomatic and at-risk
individuals. Participants were consented online [14] and were mailed a home collection kit that
included supplies and instructions to collect three specimens: a saliva specimen for SARS-CoV2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody testing, an oropharyngeal swab (OPS or
“throat swab”) for PCR testing, and a dried blood spot (DBS) card for antibody testing.
Participants collected specimens during a telehealth session with a healthcare provider on a
HIPAA-compliant video conferencing service. Specimens were returned to the central study
laboratory in a provided mailer and tested in the central laboratory. Participants were
compensated $40 in Amazon credit for their time. The study was reviewed and approved by our
institution's human subjects research review committee.

Following specimen collection, the clinicians asked participants for suggestions about how to
improve the collection instructions or process. Participants were also administered an online
survey that collected data on the acceptability of the collection of the three specimens types, the

process of packing and shipping the specimens, and how confident the participants were that
they had collected the specimens adequately to be accurate as diagnostic specimens.
Participants were also asked three open-ended questions in the online survey to gather
qualitative data on suggestions for improvement of the specimen collection instructions.
Specifically, they were asked to document suggestions to improve the clarity of instructions to
collect or pack each specimen type. We analyzed the data by describing Likert scale scores (15, where 1 was very unacceptable and 5 was very acceptable) proportions for acceptability of
specimen collection and packing/shipping and medians and interquartile ranges for each
acceptability item. We used Kruskal-Wallace tests [15] to describe differences in median
acceptability across different demographic groups (i.e., gender, age, race/ethnicity, education).
We used a Bonferroni-type correction to set an experiment-wise p alpha of 0.05, considering the
16 comparisons planned in the analysis [16]. We also combined the very acceptable and
acceptable responses to make a dichotomous measure of acceptability (i.e., acceptable or very
acceptable was categorized as “acceptable”, and all other responses were considered
neutral/not acceptable). We used the same process to evaluate data on the confidence of
participants that their specimen was suitable for COVID-related testing.

Telehealth observers recorded verbal participant feedback on the process, including participant
suggestions of how to improve collection and shipping materials and instructions. Two coders
independently read through all participant comments and created themes independently; they
then worked together to develop a codebook that was used to independently code the data. A
thematic analysis was conducted [17] seeking to assess emergent themes regarding challenges
and areas for improvement for the self-collection and return shipping process. The summarized
comment themes, examples and frequencies by specimen type are presented in a tabular
format.

Results

Of the 153 participants who self-collected specimens, 148 (97%) completed the post-collection
survey for at least one specimen type and provided data on the acceptability of the specimen
collection methods and packing/shipping. Most participants were female (59%), non-Hispanic
white (70%), and had at least some education beyond high school (97%); median age was 2749 years (IQR: 27-49). Most surveys were completed within two days of the specimen collection
(100, 68%) with 23 on the same day (16%), 46 on the first (31%), 31 on the second (21%) day
after the collection. A total of 82 participants provided 135 responses (some containing more
than one code or theme) to open-ended survey items with suggestions for improving the
specimen collection process. Fifty comments were provided for the DBS collection (34% of
those submitting DBS specimens), 53 for saliva collection (35% of those submitting a saliva
specimen), and 32 throat swab collection (21% of those submitting a throat swab specimen).

Acceptability of the collection of all three specimen types was high (>84%, Figure 1). Over 90%
of participants rated the DBS collection and packaging and mailing processes as very
acceptable or acceptable, and 84-86% of participants rated the saliva specimen and throat
swab as very acceptable or acceptable. Few participants reported aspects of the collection as
unacceptable or very unacceptable: packaging (3%), DBS collection (4%), saliva collection
(5%), and throat swab collection (5%). 6%-11% of participants were neutral on acceptability of
these components. The median acceptability rating for the DBS specimen was 4 (scale: 1-5,
where 5 is very acceptable) and the median acceptability for saliva, throat swab, and packaging
and mailing process were 5 (Figure 2). There were no significant differences in the median
acceptability of any specimen type of the packaging process by gender, age, race, ethnicity, or
education (data not presented).

Most participants (87%) reported feeling confident or very confident in the submission of their
self-collected specimens for laboratory testing (Figure 3). There were no differences in the
median confidence in specimen collection by age, race/ethnicity, or education (data not
presented).

We identified a number of key themes from participant suggestions, and each was given a code:
specimen collection instructions, specimen collection diagrams, kit packaging, device
complexity, specimen contamination potential, missing kit materials, and kit shipping (Table 1).
Comments categorized as specimen collection instructions were most common (n=98
comments) if they described a lack of clarity in the wording or structure of the instruction guide.
This included concerns about imprecise or overly technical wording of instructions, inconsistent
terminology, lack of sequential ordering of steps, lack of appropriate detail, and inaccessible font
type and size. If specifically describing difficulties or suggestions related to the images in the
instruction guide, comments were categorized as specimen collection diagrams. Thirty
comments related to kit packaging and detailed difficulties finding the instructions, devices, or
supplies inside the kit due to how materials were packaged or organized. Common suggestions
within this category were to color code all materials to match the instruction guide, clearly
separate and label the three specimen types, and place the instruction guide on top of all other
kit materials. Comments in this category were less common (n=20) and were typically about
needing more diagrams, more detail with the diagrams and inconsistencies between the images
and written text. Twenty comments about device complexity detailed difficulties with the
collection process due to physical characteristics of the specimen collection devices and offered
suggestions to improve clarity of instructions to help participants identify kit components. The saliva device

and the DBS collection lancets were described most frequently as being unfamiliar or complex.
Comments about specimen contamination potential were uncommon (n=9) and related to
perceived contamination of the samples during testing due to either the design of the devices or

the instructions. In particular, a few participants were concerned with contaminating the OP
swab by touching or dropping it before collection. They were also concerned with contaminating
the DBS card by touching the paper directly. Four comments related to missing kit materials
described one or more of the components of the kit missing during testing due to packing error.
The participants in this category described missing shipping materials, lancets, or biohazard
bags. The final category of kit shipping included only two responses related to opportunities to
clarify the procedure for packaging and return shipping the kit.
Discussion

We performed a mixed-methods assessment of the acceptability of three self-collected
specimen types for COVID-19 related testing and the confidence of participants in their ability to
collect these specimens after they had completed a self-collection process. Our results indicate
high acceptability for all three specimen types and high confidence in self-collected specimens.
Despite the high overall acceptability of specimen collection, we also identified areas for
improving the clarity of instructions and ease of use for devices. These suggestions can be used
to further refine the kit and instruction process to improve usability and to decrease potential
errors in specimen collection.
We have previously reported that in hypothetical willingness to use at-home specimen collection
kits for COVID-19 infection and immune response testing was high (saliva collection: 88%
willing; throat swab: 83% willing) among participants in a different, large online sample of US
persons. In that study, like the present study, willingness did not vary by race/ethnicity or
sex.[18] Younger respondents reported a lower willingness to self-collect an oropharyngeal
swab in that study. [18] Further, respondents in the same online study reported high willingness
to use home-collection kits to receive COVID-19-related testing for their clinical care (92%
reported willingness to use self-collection of saliva and 88% reported willingness to self-collect a
throat swab for clinical care).[12] Willingness to use saliva collection and throat swabs for

clinical care in that study did not differ by age groups, race/ethnicity, COVID-19 stigma score,
COVID-19 knowledge score, or COVID-19 symptomatology. The consistency in the hypothetical
willingness to use these methods for research or clinical care and the acceptability of their use
after using the kits is notable.
For HIV self-specimen collection systems, hypothetical interest in use was reported to be high
before tests became commercially available, but uptake was quite low after they reached the
market. [19,20] In the present study, the acceptability of saliva and throat swab collections were
higher after participants used them than self-reported hypothetical willingness to use such
collection devices in a previous survey. Although a number of factors will eventually influence
utilization [21], these data suggest promise for eventual use if these collection methods are
made available in the US.
Overall, about half of participants did not provide suggestions to improve the specimen
collection process. Of those who did, nearly two-thirds of recommendations were for
improvements to the written instructions or diagrams, which can be implemented with minimal
redesign of kit components. Our observations of the participants using these kits was the first
step in a multi-phased process of developing kits for broader use. We have used this staged
process in the past to develop home-use kits for collection of DBS specimens and for home
testing devices.[22,23] The data collected from these participants who used a pre-pilot version
of the kits will be used to refine instructions. In the case of our PrEP@Home project, we also
developed a video (https://vimeo.com/138977095) to illustrate the key steps of the process and
to draw attention to potential errors in self-collection that were observed in the pilot phase. In
this case, we will use the data from participant suggestions to clarify instructions, redesign the
user experience in terms of the assembly and order of kit components, take steps to minimize
touching of the DBS card before specimen collection, and include more explicit instructions for
packaging and returning the kit. With these modifications in place, we will re-pilot the usability of
the modified kit to test the impact of the modifications.

The feedback of the participants is interpreted in light of the evaluation of the specimen quality
by clinicians and laboratorians.[24] The specimens collected by these same participants were
judged by clinicians to be suitable for laboratory testing (saliva: 97%; throat swab: 96%) and
were found to have adequate nucleic acid for RNA PCR diagnostic testing (saliva: 100%; throat
swab: 99%).[24]. Comparing the three measures in terms of the assessment of sufficiency of
specimen collection, participants had the lowest confidence in the adequacy of their specimen
collections; healthcare providers observing the collection and laboratorians processing the
specimens were more confident in the sufficiency of the specimens.
Our study has important limitations. Our participants represent a convenience sample, and it is
likely that they are a biased sample and may over-represent people interested in COVID-19related testing generally, or people concerned about their own SARS-CoV-2 infection status. It
is unclear how these biases might impact the results of our self-evaluation of acceptability of
specimen collection. Further, the lay opinions of participants about their confidence in the
sufficiency of specimens they collected may be naive since they were not selected for
healthcare or laboratory expertise. However, the results of clinician observation and laboratorian
assessment supported their views of the sufficiency of their samples; the triangulation of these
three assessments lends credence to the potential sufficiency of self-collected specimens for
COVID testing.[25]
The United States is in dire need of options to increase screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection and
immune experience, and survey data suggest that people might be more willing to collect
specimens at home for research and clinical purposes than to travel into labs or clinics to
provide specimens.[12,26] At-home self collection offers possibilities to reduce the exposure of
people in need of screening to others by not requiring travel to test; to reduce the need for PPE
for invasive screening tests; to offer options for screening of populations without symptoms who
might be unwilling to travel to a clinic for testing. Next steps in this development process include
modification to kit instructions and assembly, addition of instructions for shipping, development
