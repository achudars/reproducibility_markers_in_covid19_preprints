Abstract:
Background: In December 2019, an outbreak of new type of coronavirus named
COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. In a very short time, this virus
spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development.
The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to
prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these

Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health
Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth
speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth
speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax).
Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the
dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number
of plateaus were analyzed.
Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China,
the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days;
exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of
plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance
from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a
province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were
implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and
effectively over China.
Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on
controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus–infected pneumonia.
These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the
COVID-19 epidemic.

Introduction
On December 8, 2019, the first patient with atypical pneumonia of unknown origin
was reported by the government of Wuhan, Hubei, China [1]. Since then, the outbreak
in Wuhan became an epidemic, rapidly spreading through China and other countries.
On January 1, 2020, a new type of coronavirus was isolated and finally named COVID19 by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020 [2, 3]. According to reports
[4]

, by March 1, 2020, more than 60 countries or areas had reported the confirmed

patients with COVID-19, and more than 80,000 patients had been confirmed with
COVID-19 worldwide. This has serious implications for both public health and
development in China and the world.
To control the diffusion and deterioration of the epidemic of COVID-19 in China,
the Chinese government implemented series of strict and unprecedented intervention
strategies [5, 6]. For example, on January 21, 2020, COVID-19 was classed as a Class B
infectious disease and was controlled as a Class A infectious disease; on January 23,
2020, Wuhan was quarantined to limit the diffusion of patients with COVID-19. All
other provinces and areas in China also began to control public gatherings and the
migration of people from January 21, 2020. These mandatory strategies carried out by
the government showed significant effects on containing the contagion of COVID-19,
and the number of new confirmed cases remarkably decreased at the end of February
2020.
To estimate optimally the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling the diffusion
and deterioration of COVID-19 in China, we performed model fitting and calculated
the time at which the growth speed of the cumulative number of confirmed patients
reached the maximum.

Methods
Data sources
For COVID-19 data, we collected the number of cumulative confirmed patients
from January 21, 2020 to February 23, 2020 because almost all areas in China began to
report confirmed cases from January 21, 2020, and the growth speed reached zero
around most areas except Hubei before February 23, 2020. The number of cumulative
confirmed patients with COVID-19 in different provinces or areas were acquired from
the respective Health Commission websites of China. For COVID-19 data, areas of
Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan were not analyzed in this study. The emigration index
in

website

(http://qianxi.baidu.com/).

Model fitting for known data
In this study, we tried multiple curve models to fit known data and times. We used
the following models to attempt a good fit of the data: exponential, logarithmic, power
function, compound, growth, inverse, logistic, linear, quadratic, cubic, and quartic. Of
these, the quartic model showed the best fit, and almost all correlation coefficients
reached R2 > 0.99 for fitted curves in different areas. With time defined as x and January
21, 2020 was recorded as the time “1,” the number of cumulative confirmed patients
with COVID-19 (y) and time (x) were expressed as the following quartic function:

𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥 4 + 𝑏𝑥 3 + 𝑐𝑥 2 + ⅆ𝑥 + ⅇ

The growth speed calculation for fitted curves
According to fitted curves modeled by known data, we found that almost all fitted

curves showed an “S” form. This suggested that the growth speed of cumulative
confirmed cases increased first and gradually decreased after reaching the maximum.
Therefore, we analyzed the continuous change of the growth speed and obtained the
time when the growth speed reached the maximum (Speedmax) by drawing the
derivative function of the fitted curves. When the time was defined as x and January 21,
2020 was recorded as the time “1,” the growth speed (y') and time (x) were expressed
as the following function:

𝑦 ′ = 4𝑎𝑥 3 + 3𝑏𝑥 2 + 2𝑐𝑥 + 𝑑
By drawing the derivative function of the fitted curves, we found that changes of
the growth speed (y') were accorded with our hypothesis. The growth speed (y')
increases firstly and declines sequentially after reaching the Speedmax.

The plateau of cumulative confirmed patients of COVID-19
Before February 23, 2020, the growth speed basically reached zero (new confirmed
patients≤1 per day) for most areas except Hubei. If one area reported zero new cases
for at least two days, the corresponding number of cumulative confirmed patients with
COVID-19 was defined as the plateau number. If an area did not meet the criterion of
zero-growth speed for two days, then the number of cumulative confirmed patients on
February 23, 2020 was recorded as the plateau number.

Software, instruments and statistics
In this study, model fitting was implemented by IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 and
Microsoft Office Excel 2010. The fitted functions and correlation coefficients were
calculated by IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 and Microsoft Office Excel 2010 as well. The
curve of the derivative function was created by the drawing instrument from http://www.

The heat map of China was generated by the drawing instrument from
http://www.dituhui.com/.

Results
Model fitting for known data in mainland China
First, we performed model fitting of different areas in mainland China except for
Xizang and Qinghai because the confirmed number of cases were too few in these areas
to model. The fitted curves were good, and all correlation coefficients R2 > 0.99 except
for those in Jilin (R2 = 0.989) and Hubei (R2 = 0.988). Areas were divided into three
parts: areas adjoined to Hubei (Figure 1), northern areas (Figure 2), and southern areas
(Figure 3) of China. Because of an adjustment to confirmation criteria, the number of
confirmed patients in Wuhan surged on February 22, 2020. Similarly, 200 new
confirmed patients surged in Shandong on February 19, 2020 due to an outbreak of
COVID-19 in a prison. However, the growth speed had basically reached zero since
February 17, 2020 in Shandong. To eliminate the influence of this specific incident and
perform model fitting, we fit the model for Shandong with adjusted data.

Calculation of Speedmax
In this study, HongKong, Macao and Taiwan were not analyzed. Xizang, Xinjiang,
Qinghai and Ningxia were not appropriate for Speedmax analyses because the confirmed
patients were few or the growth speed was too smooth. Almost all areas in mainland
China reached Speedmax within 14 days except Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou,
and Hubei (Figure 4). Thus, the growth speed of confirmed cases began to decline in
almost all areas before February 3, 2020. Because the outbreak of COVID-19 originated

from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, more time was required for Hubei and Wuhan to
reach Speedmax (21–22 days and 23–24 days, respectively), although strict strategies
were implemented in these regions.
The heat map of times for Speedmax suggests that the distance from other areas to
Hubei have little influence arriving at Speedmax (Figure 4). After implementation of
strict intervention strategies, the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 was inhibited
quickly and effectively over China. Even the speed in Hubei, with the exception of
Wuhan, reached Speedmax and began to decline in 14–15 days, which showed similar
trends to those of other areas in mainland China.
As shown in Table 1, the average time to Speedmax was 11–12 days in China, with
the exception of Hubei. Because little information was acquired at the beginning of the
outbreak of COVID-19, it is understandable that Wuhan needed a longer time to reach
the Speedmax point.
The detailed data for the time to Speedmax and emigration index was shown in
Supplementary Table 1.

The plateau of cumulative confirmed patients of COVID-19
The heat map of the plateau in mainland China (Figure 5) revealed that the plateau
numbers were higher in areas adjoined to Hubei and southern areas of China and were
lower in the northern area, especially in the western part of the northern area of China.
After regression analysis and model-fitting, results suggested that the number of
plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index, and the correlation
coefficient reached 0.74 (Figure 6). However, the plateau numbers had no significant
correlation with the time of Speedmax when compared with different areas in China. In
Zhejiang, though the plateau numbers ranked third among mainland China except

Hubei, the growth speed reached the Speedmax point and declined earlier than in many
areas. This suggested that the spread of COVID-19 was controlled more quickly and
effectively in Zhejiang. More detail about the number of plateaus is shown in
Supplementary Table 1.

Discussion
COVID-19, a new and severe epidemic, has threatened public health and economic
development in China

[7]

. As of March 6, 2020, the number of cumulative confirmed

cases of COVID-19 has reached 100,000 worldwide, and some countries such as Korea,
Japan, Italy, and Iran are also suffering from the rapid spread of COVID-19 [4, 7, 8]. The
need for greater attention and intervention strategies to curb the spread of COVID-19
around the world is of paramount importance.
To inhibit the spread of COVID-19 as quickly as possible, the Chinese government
took actions rapidly and implemented a series of strategies

[5, 6, 9]

. For example, (1)

President Xi of China conducted and deployed the control of COVID-19 personally,
and all-of-government and all-of-society approaches were employed to contain viral
spread; (2) Wuhan and other areas in Hubei were thoroughly quarantined, and the flow
of people was completely restricted over the China; (3) a large number of doctors and
nurses over China were assigned to Hubei to cure patients with COVID-19; (4) new
special hospitals and vast mobile cabin hospitals were constructed quickly for
accommodating patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and grading treatments;
(5) critical medical resources and goods were regulated and distributed by the
government; (6) traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine were combined to
treat patients.
To better understand and estimate the effects of Chinese strategies on controlling

the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 in mainland China, we implemented
model fitting and designed an index named Speedmax, which represented the time when
the growth speed of the cumulative confirmed cases reached its maximum. According
to our analyses, the growth speed generally increased first and decreased to zero quickly
after reaching the Speedmax point. The area under the curve (AUC) of the derivative
function represents the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Thus, per region, a
shorter time to Speedmax generally indicates a smaller AUC, representing fewer
cumulative confirmed cases when reaching the plateau. Therefore, to some extent, the
time to Speedmax demonstrates the effectiveness of strategies on inhibiting the spread
of virus. Notably, since the plateau number is affected by multiple factors, it is
inappropriate to conclude that one area with shorter Speedmax means fewer plateau
number than another area with longer Speedmax. The Speedmax is useful for assessing
changes of the plateau number itself.
According to our study, we found that these Chinese strategies for controlling the
diffusion of COVID-19 are significantly effective and powerful. By implementing
multiple Chinese strategies, the growth speed of confirmed patients reached Speedmax
and began to decline within 14 days in almost all areas of mainland China. Yang et al.
[9]

also reported that a five-day delay in the implementation of the Chinese strategies

would have increased the epidemic size in mainland China threefold. In addition, we
found that the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus have little
influence arriving at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented,
the diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively
over China. With the exception of Wuhan, even Hubei, where the cumulative confirmed
patients reached 17,680 on February 23, 2020, the speed of growth still reached
Speedmax and began to decline in 14–15 days.

The present study has certain limitations. In this study, we simplified the model
analysis and performed model fitting with known data. Although the classical
susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed
(SEIR) models were not adopted, the quartic model showed a good fit to known data.
This helps us to learn the trends of cumulative confirmed cases quickly and easily.
However, our fitted models were all based on known data as it was more appropriate
than forecasting future data trends. In addition, the changes in trends of basic
reproduction number (R0) are not discussed in our study. The effects of Chinese
strategies will be better understood if the time to Speedmax and changes in R0 are
discussed together. Third, more data of different infectious diseases and studies are
needed to verify the effectiveness and value of the index Speedmax.
In conclusion, by analyzing the time to Speedmax, our study suggests that Chinese
strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the Novel
Coronavirus–Infected Pneumonia. These strategies therefore provide experience and
effective guidelines for other countries to control the diffusion of COVID-19.
