Abstract
Effective therapies for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed, and preclinical
data suggest alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (⍺1-AR antagonists) may be effective in
reducing mortality related to hyperinflammation. Using a retrospective cohort design with patients in
the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system, we use doubly robust regression and matching
to estimate the association between use of ⍺1-AR antagonists at time of hospitalization and likelihood
of death due to COVID-19 during an inpatient stay. Having an active prescription for an ⍺1-AR
antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or alfuzosin) at the time of
admission had a significant negative association with in-hospital mortality (relative risk reduction
14%; odds ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.86; p ≤ 0.001). These effects were also found in an expanded
cohort of suspected COVID-19 patients, supporting the need for clinical trials.

Introduction

The viral replication phase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be followed by a
hyperinflammatory host immune response referred to as cytokine storm syndrome. This can lead to
acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death despite maximal supportive care
(1,2). Catecholamines amplify hyperinflammation by increasing cytokine production in immune cells
(3). Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (⍺1-AR antagonists) can prevent cytokine storm syndrome
and death in mice by blocking catecholamine signaling (4). In a retrospective analysis of hospitalized
patients presenting with acute respiratory distress or pneumonia, patients incidentally taking ⍺1-AR
antagonists had a 34% relative risk reduction for being mechanically ventilated and dying compared
to non-users (5).
The objective of this study was to examine the association of ⍺1-AR antagonist use with inhospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed patients hospitalized at Veterans Health
Administration (VA) hospitals, where ⍺1-AR antagonists are commonly used to treat benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and hypertension. We hypothesized that
patients with COVID-19 taking ⍺1-AR antagonists at the time of hospital admission would be less
likely to die during their hospitalization.

Method

2.1

Study Population & Variables

We included all patients admitted to a VA hospital between February 20, 2020, and August 5,
2020 with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (Figure 1). Diagnosis codes for COVID-19 were
identified from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) coding guidelines for COVID19 (6,7). The VA COVID-19 Shared Data Resource was used to identify VA patients with a SARSCoV-2 laboratory test result (8). This data resource combines VA-specific lab results with non-VA
lab results using text extraction from patient medical records. Because over 90% of ⍺1-AR antagonist
users in the analysis were older men, we excluded women to reduce unmeasured confounding in risk
of respiratory conditions unrelated to COVID-19. We also excluded patients under age 45 and
patients over age 85 given the strong relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and age.
An expanded sample included all patients with laboratory-confirmed, “suspected positive”, or
“possible positive” COVID-19 according to National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) criteria
(9). This Suspected COVID-19 sample excluded patients who tested negative for COVID-19. This
cohort was not operationally different from the main cohort on vital signs at admission
(Supplementary Figure 1).
The primary outcome was death during the index hospitalization. The primary exposure
variable was the use of ⍺1-AR antagonists at the time of admission for the index hospitalization.
Active prescriptions of ⍺1-AR antagonists (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or
alfuzosin) were identified and defined by the patient having medication on hand on the day of the
index admission, regardless of dosage. Secondary analyses examined the effect of tamsulosin (the
most commonly prescribed ⍺1-AR antagonist) and doxazosin (a nonselective ⍺1-AR antagonist)
alone. Finally, with in-hospital therapies in-flux during the early stage of the pandemic, we repeated
the analysis by week and VA hospital to ensure results were not driven by any particular time or
location.

from COVID-19
We obtained data on patient demographics, vital signs, and prescriptions from VA’s corporate
data warehouse (CDW). Patient comorbidities were based on the International Classification of
Diseases, Version 10 codes from VA care in the prior year. Other physiologic variables, including
oxygen saturation and temperature, were defined at time of inpatient admission.
2.2

Analysis

Analyses followed the methodology of a companion paper examining patients with acute
respiratory distress and pneumonia (5). Unadjusted analysis compared patients with ⍺1-AR antagonist
prescriptions to all other patients with COVID-19 using Fisher’s exact test. We then estimated
propensity scores and trimmed the sample to ensure overlap in the propensity score distributions of
the exposed and unexposed groups. On this reduced sample, the adjusted analysis used inverse
propensity-weighted logistic regression adjusting for the patient age at admission (input as a
demeaned cubic polynomial to allow a nonlinear relationship), calendar week, location of
hospitalization, and comorbidities diagnosed any time in the two years prior to the index inpatient
stay. This approach is “doubly robust” in that it uses the observed confounders in both the calculation
of the propensity score and the odds ratios. Comorbidities included in the matching procedure were
diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, acute myocardial infarction, COPD, and
PTSD.
All of the control variables reflect information on the Veterans prior to admission with
COVID-19. As noted above, we controlled for secular changes in COVID-19 care using calendar
week, starting with February 20, 2020. We chose not to examine endpoints during the hospital stay,
such as use of a ventilator or admission to the ICU, given this is based on physician coding or data
structures that we cannot assure were handled uniformly, especially during surges. We also chose
not to control for processes of care during the stay given this could introduce bias in the analysis.
We then conducted a 5:1 matched analysis using the same covariates as the adjusted model
(10). This approach assigns each exposed patient to a set of five unexposed patients most similar on
observed characteristics and does not make assumptions about the functional form of the potential
relationship between confounders and the outcome. Matches were selected using a greedy, nearestneighbor approach based on Mahalanobis distance (11). The matched analysis used the CochranMantel-Haenszel test to obtain odds ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values. We also present
relative risk reductions (RRR) for the matched cohorts, and the pre- and post-matching balance of
covariates is shown in Figure 3.

Results

3.1

Sample Characteristics

The sample contained 12,266 patients with COVID-19, with 2,555 taking any ⍺1-AR antagonist
at admission. Of those taking ⍺1-AR antagonists, 72% were on tamsulosin, and 4% were on
doxazosin (Figure 1). Table 1 provides sample characteristics.
3.2

Risk of In-Hospital Mortality

For patients admitted to a VA hospital between February 20, 2020, and August 5, 2020, the
overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9%. Among patients with confirmed COVID-19 (5.5% of all
admissions), in-hospital mortality was 17.3%. Patients with COVID-19 taking any ⍺1-AR antagonist,
compared to non-users, had a 14% relative risk reduction for death (340/2,417 in matched treatment
group vs. 1,383/8,422 in matched control group, p ≤ 0.001).

The top panel in figure 2 shows the unadjusted, propensity score adjusted, and matched odds
ratios among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n = 12,266). The bottom panel expands the
denominator to include suspected positive cases (n = 16,866). The dark green odds ratios in Figure 2
represent all ⍺1-AR antagonists, while the lighter green represent doxazosin. Figure 2 shows that the
results are similar for the Suspected COVID-19 sample. Patients taking ⍺1-AR antagonists, compared
to non-users, had an 11% relative risk reduction for death (p ≤ 0.001) in this cohort (Figure 2).
Use of doxazosin, a nonselective ⍺1-AR antagonist similar to prazosin used in preclinical
studies of cytokine storm syndrome, resulted in a 43% relative risk reduction for death (11/101 in
matched treatment group vs. 96/505 in matched control group, p=0.02, Figure 2). Use of tamsulosin,
the most common ⍺1-AR antagonist in this cohort, had a 10% relative risk reduction for death (p =
0.01, Supplementary Figure 2). Even though COVID-19 has affected different parts of the US at
different times, we found no evidence that these results were driven by any particular time period or
location (Supplementary Figures 3 and 4).

Discussion

In this retrospective analysis of patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19, we found a
significant negative association between the use of ⍺1-AR antagonists and in-hospital mortality.
Immune cells can express all ⍺1-AR subtypes (⍺1A-, ⍺1D-, and ⍺1B-AR), and catecholamine signaling
through individual receptors may be highly redundant (1,2). Emerging preclinical data suggests that
⍺1-AR antagonists with nonselective effects on ⍺1A-, ⍺1D-, and ⍺1B-AR may be potent in mitigating
hyperinflammation and preventing death in animal models of cytokine storm syndrome (3). In
patients with suspected COVID-19, use of doxazosin, an antagonist on all three ⍺1-ARs, was
associated with significantly reduced in-hospital mortality compared to controls (odds ratio for death
0.38 in adjusted and 0.51 in matched cohorts). A similar trend was seen in patients with confirmed
COVID-19, but the sample size limited precision. Tamsulosin, by comparison, is a “uroselective” ⍺1AR antagonist with antagonism on both ⍺1A- and ⍺1D-ARs expressed in prostatic tissue, without
clinically relevant inhibition of ⍺1B-ARs expressed by immune cells and peripheral vasculature.
Baseline tamsulosin use in patients with confirmed and suspected COVID-19 was associated with
significant, but less pronounced reductions in in-hospital mortality (Supplementary Figure 2),
consistent with a potential redundancy in catecholamine signaling through the ⍺1B-AR (12).
One concern with observational analysis is confounding by indication, especially if medication
use is correlated with disease severity. This analysis examines Veterans' use of ⍺1-AR antagonists
prior to hospitalization. These medications are often used to manage chronic conditions, and
prescribing practices would not be biased by the severity of COVID-19. In addition, the results were
not driven by a specific location or time period.
This study has some important strengths and weaknesses. A strength is the focus on mortality
thereby avoiding process measures, such as use of ventilators or admission to an ICU, that could be
biased if clinicians or hospitals changed their practices in unobserved ways. Another strength is our
use of information prior to the COVID-19 admission for risk adjustment. We also did not control for
process of care during the stay, which might induce biases. One limitation in this study was the
exclusion of women because ⍺1-AR antagonists are most commonly used to treat benign prostatic
hyperplasia, and 90% of patients in the VA system are men (13). A second limitation was our
inability to examine dose effects given our sample size. These issues would need to be evaluated in a
prospective clinical trial.

from COVID-19
The results highlight the need for prospective, controlled clinical trials to examine the efficacy
of doxazosin for reducing in-hospital mortality and other adverse outcomes from COVID-19. ⍺1-AR
antagonists are inexpensive, administered orally, and have an established safety profile. Thus, if trials
confirm these results, ⍺1-AR antagonists could be widely deployed. Prior research has shown that ⍺1AR antagonists were associated with fewer adverse outcomes for patients with pneumonia (5), so a
clinical trial might reveal options for mitigating the cytokine storm resulting from pneumonia,
COVID-19, or another coronavirus.
In summary, this study suggests that male patients with laboratory-confirmed, “suspected
positive”, or “possible positive” COVID-19 diagnosis had lower odds of mortality if they had an
active prescription for an ⍺1-AR antagonist (tamsulosin, silodosin, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, or
alfuzosin) at the time of admission (relative risk reduction 14%). There was considerable variation
by type of ⍺1-AR antagonist. Doxazosin was associated with 43% relative risk reduction for death,
while tamsulosin, the most common ⍺1-AR antagonist in this cohort, had a 10% relative risk
reduction for death. A clinical trial testing the efficacy of an ⍺1-AR antagonist, most likely
doxazosin, would appear warranted.
