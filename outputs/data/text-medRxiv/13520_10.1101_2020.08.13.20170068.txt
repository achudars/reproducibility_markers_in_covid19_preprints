Contact patterns are the drivers of close-contacts infections, such as COVID-19. In an
effort to control COVID-19 transmission in the UK, schools were closed on 23 March
2020. With social distancing in place, Primary Schools were partially re-opened on 1
June 2020, with plans to fully re-open in September 2020. The impact of social
distancing and risk mitigation measures on children’s contact patterns is not known.

We conducted a structured expert elicitation of a sample of Primary Headteachers to
quantify contact patterns within schools in pre-COVID-19 times and how these patterns
were expected to change upon re-opening. Point estimates with uncertainty were
determined by a formal performance-based algorithm. Additionally, we surveyed school
Headteachers about risk mitigation strategies and their anticipated effectiveness.

Expert elicitation provides estimates of contact patterns that are consistent with
contact surveys. We report mean number of contacts per day for four cohorts within
schools along with a range at 90% confidence for the variations of contacts among
individuals. Prior to lockdown, we estimate that, mean numbers per day, younger
children (Reception and Year 1) made 15 contacts [range 8..35] within school, older
children (Year 6) 18 contacts [range 5.. 55], teaching staff 25 contacts [range 4.. 55) and
non-classroom staff 11 contacts [range 2.. 27]. Compared to pre-COVID times, after
schools re-opened the mean number of contacts were reduced by about 53% for young
children, about 62% for older children, about 60% for classroom staff and about 64% for
other staff. Contacts between teaching and non-teaching staff reduced by 80%, which
is consistent with other independent estimates. The distributions of contacts per
person are asymmetric indicating a heavy tail of individuals with high contact numbers.

We interpret the reduction in children’s contacts as a consequence of efforts to reduce
mixing with interventions such as forming groups of children (bubbles) who are
organized to learn together to limit contacts. Distributions of contacts for children and
adults can be used to inform COVID-19 transmission modelling. Our findings suggest
that while official DfE guidelines form the basis for risk mitigation in schools, individual
schools have adopted their own bespoke strategies, often going beyond the guidelines.

On 11th May 2020 Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that selected primary age
children would return to school on 1st June in England. The returning cohort would
include Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, noting that there would also be Year 2 to 5
children of frontline workers and those identified as vulnerable were already being
taught in many schools. Nursery age children were also invited to return with some
nurseries being part of Primary schools. The devolved administrations decided at the
time not to re-open schools. The Government abandoned the proposal for a full return
of Primary school children in England before the summer holidays. There is now an
expectation that schools will fully re-open in September.

The partial re-opening of Primary schools has been widely debated with concerns from
some parents, teaching unions and teacher associations about the safety of the children
and school staff. There was also concern about the effect on infection rate in the wider
community, for example by triggering a second wave. Some schools re-opened on 1st
June, some have delayed their re-start while, in other cases, schools have not reopened under advice of local education authorities. Data from DfE indicates on 15th July
that about 88% of state-funded Primary Schools have re-opened to some extent. The
community response has been variable and between 1st and 15th June 2020
approximately one third of eligible children returned. The numbers have increased
somewhat and were 41% (year 1) and 49% (year 6) on 2nd July. Between 18th May and
31st July 2020 there have been 247 COVID-19 related incidents in schools of which 116
were tested to be positive test (PHE 2020).

Contact patterns, as drivers of transmission for close-contact infections, are an essential
component of epidemiological models (Del Valle et al. 2007; Mossong et al. 2008;
Eames et al. 2012; Danon et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2020). There is, however, a paucity of
information about the contact patterns of younger children, especially in school
settings, due to the challenges involved in collecting data from children. Here we
address this question by applying Structured Expert Judgement (SEJ) using leaders in
Primary Schools as experts. SEJ is a well-established approach to quantifying
parameters and their attendant uncertainties where there are no data or the data are
sparse or of poor quality or are highly empirical in character or have large associated
uncertainties (Cooke 1991; Colson & Cooke 2017). This is the case for many
epidemiological parameters, including contact patterns which are used in combination
with the probability of transmission and the infectious period to describe the
reproduction number in a population. SEJ has been widely applied to risk assessment
and uncertainty analysis in many areas of science, engineering, the environment,
business and public health (Colson & Cooke 2017). The Classical Model for SEJ has been
deployed in several public health policy applications (e.g. Barons & Aspinall 2020;
Beshearse et al. in press; Hald et al. 2016; Hincks et al. 2006; Martell et al. 2007;
Tyshenko et al. 2012, 2016). Notably SEJ is not widely used in epidemiology.

We identified 34 volunteers from within the Royal Society Schools network, most of
whom had a STEM background. The group of experts were leaders and senior staff of
state-funded Primary Schools in England. The focus of the SEJ was to quantify contact
patterns within schools and investigate how these patterns had changed between preCOVID and COVID times. We also took the opportunity to survey school staff about
their risk mitigation strategies and asked for information to assess their effectiveness.

Under current circumstances the usual approach to SEJ involving typically 1 or 2 days of
face-to-face discussions between experts was impractical and would in any case
contravene social distancing requirements. We therefore augmented the SEJ and survey
with six structured interviews to improve our understanding of the responses.

To determine variable or parameter uncertainty distributions we utilized a validated
elicitation method, Classical Model for Structured Expert Judgement (SEJ). The method
is described in Cooke (1991), Colson & Cooke (2017) and in:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_expert_judgment:_the_classical_model. The
distinctive feature of the Classical Model is that experts, in a group being elicited, are
empirically calibrated for their ability to judge uncertainties in terms of statistical
accuracy taken over a set of knowable test variables from within the subject matter
domain. The resulting performance-based calibration scores are used as weights to
create a synthetic combined distribution which is also scored for statistical accuracy and
informativeness. The so-called Decision Maker (DM) is in effect, a synthesized pseudoexpert, which represents the group’s collective judgement. Expert weights are
predicated on the mathematical concept of ‘proper scoring’ rules, with the resulting
Decision Maker solutions providing a rational consensus of the experts’ judgments,
weighted according to the individual calibration performance scores. From here in the
article the volunteer primary school staff will be termed experts.

Calibration questions, to which true answers are known post hoc, for the SEJ were
prepared by WPA. Calibration and target item elicitation questionnaires are provided in
Appendix 1. Elicitation questions were devised by the authors to elucidate contact
patterns within schools. We also took the opportunity to ask the Head Teachers about
risk mitigation measures that they have put in place. Before circulating to the experts
the calibration and elicitation questions were reviewed by Professor Andrew Noyes
(Faculty of Education, University of Nottingham) to check their clarity. Some revisions
were made as a consequence of these reviews. Normally experts are convened at least
in one or more face-to-face meetings in an SEJ. A meeting usually covers: introduction
to the methodology; calibration of the experts using seed questions; presentation and
discussion of the questions; and a time for the experts to answer the questions. A
meeting might last 1 or 2 days and with plenty of time for discussion on the evidence
that informs responses to the questions. After the data have been processed there then
an opportunity to discuss the results and there may be opportunities to re-elicit some
questions.

During national lockdown and with experts distributed in Primary Schools across
England the normal procedure was not possible. A briefing session was held by zoom
and most of the experts participated. The briefing session was recorded enabling those
who could not attend the chance to hear the proceedings. For both the seed and
elicitation questions Aspinall and Sparks were available to respond to queries and
clarifications by email. To compensate for the lack of a meeting six experts were chosen
for structured interviews (Longhurst, 2015). The question protocol ensured participants
described the thinking behind their quantitative answers but also allowed a free
exploration of topics the headteachers perceived of relevance to adult and child
contacts.

The major source of data comes from the expert elicitation. The Royal Society manages
a Schools network consisting of 900 schools across the four nations of the UK and the
network includes 1300 teachers. The focus of the network is STEM education and so the
majority of the teachers within the network have a STEM background. A call was made
for volunteers to participate as experts to help characterise contact data between
children, teachers and other staff in schools. The STEM background of the volunteers
was an advantage for eliciting numerical data framed by basic statistical concepts with
which the teachers were already familiar. From 36 initial volunteers, although 2
dropped out due to being in Wales or Scotland. Of the remaining 34, the 1st
questionnaire was completed by 33 teachers. The 2nd questionnaire and calibration
questions were completed by 26 teachers and calibration questions were completed by
28 teachers.

The Primary Schools ranged in size from 65 pupils to 910 with an average of 376
children. The national average is 282 pupils. The schools are geographically well
distributed: Eastern England (4); South West (8); London (5); North West (5); Midlands
(5); South and South East (6); North East (1). The schools are a mixture of urban and
rural settings. Teaching staff ranged from 53 to 5 teachers (average 18) and support
staff ranged from 66 to 4 (average 24). The national average number of teachers and
support staff per primary school are 13 and 18 respectively. These data indicate that
the study group of schools is nationally representative. All the recruited experts were
in positions of senior management or authority with descriptions including: Head or

We divided the people in the schools into four cohorts based on the children’s Year
groups and staff roles. While a simplification, the cohorts are expected to have different
contact characteristics, e.g. with respect to interactions between children, between
children and adults and between adults. The cohorts are as follows: Cohort 1 are
Nursery, Reception and Year 1 children; Cohort 2 are Years 2-6 children, noting that
Year 2-5 children are those of key workers and from vulnerable environments; Cohort 3
are classroom teachers and teaching assistants; Cohort 4 are non-teaching staff such as
administrators, cooks, etc, some of whom are expected to have more limited contact
with children.

The expert elicitation was conducted under a protocol of confidentiality and nonattribution in order to encourage individual participants to express their own
professional judgements about contact patterns, and to remove any constraint, such as
expressing only official or policy expectations.

The elicitation produced 26 complete responses from experts who had undergone
Classical Model (CM) calibration process. Thus, each had a personal statistical accuracy
score and an information score (Table 1). These scores are the basis for ascribing a
relative performance weight to each participant for pooling judgements in the context
of enumerating uncertainty assessments for specific target/query items. Classical Model
non-optimised ltem weights combination solutions (i.e. all teachers given some weight
based on calibration scores) are listed in Table 11. These weights are not the same as
ascribing equal weights to all participants. When combining judgements collectively,
each person’s uncertainty distribution is weighted according as their own performance
score, so each contributes with some real positive weight to the overall outcome.

The calibration “p-value” score is calculated on the basis of a Chi-squared test on the
deviations of the expert’s judgements over the seed questions, relative to the known
values used for calibration. Using Shannon’s relative information statistic, the Chisquared test takes the frequencies with which the expert’s assessed calibration variable
values fall within various ranges, and compares these with the counts of actual (known)
item values in the same ranges; this produces relative probabilities of match per item,
which can be summed over all calibration items to form a measure of the expert’s
statistical accuracy. When combined with the expert’s information metric (see Cooke,
1991) in a product, this p-value provides the ‘statistical accuracy’ part of the expert’s
performance score. In effect, a calibration p-value can be thought equivalent to the
probability that an expert’s performance would be regarded as statistically accurate by
chance but, in the Classical Model, it is not used in the sense of an hypothesis test.
Rather, it is the formal mathematical basis for enumerating the metric for the statistical
accuracy of the expert’s assessments and is used, with a companion information metric,
Optimized weights unweight the lower scoring experts until the performance of the
DM in terms of statistical accuracy and informativeness, is optimized

for scoring performance in assessing uncertainties. A high p-value indicates a close
correspondence between the expert’s assessment values and the known values (a
perfect score would be p = 1); a very low p-value signals major deviations exist between
the assessed and actual values. The calibration metric is a ‘fast’ function and typically
changes markedly between experts in an elicitation .

To provide some context for the teachers’ panel revealed performance scores, the
calibration and weighting profile of the group is very similar to that of other
professional expert elicitations; for example, in Figure 1 a profile is shown for a medical
panel with the same number of participants (n.b. some points overlap). While the
overall range of the teachers’ statistical accuracy p-values – from highest to lowest – is
not atypical, in this case there are fewer individuals with very low p-values (i.e. p < 10-6)
than in the medical panel; the latter represents the more usual case. With the
exception of one teacher (a very low p-value outlier not shown here), the majority of
the teachers’ p-values are more clustered at higher p-values than those obtained for
the medical panel. On the other hand, the relative information scores of the teachers
are generally lower than those of the medical experts; this may reflect inherent
differences in the natures of the precision of the data types each group were
considering.

Our conclusion is that the teachers’ elicitation does not exhibit any substantive
shortcomings compared to other cases, notwithstanding it was conducted with minimal
briefing and without the benefit of a plenary workshop to help focus judgements. In
short, the Head teachers’ performances proved to be as strong, collectively, as those of
many other groups of experts (Colson and Cooke 2017, for other case profiles).

The combination Decision Maker (DM) -- the combination of all experts -- is statistically
more accurate than any individual expert. The range of relative information metric
scores is also typical; this is a ‘slow’ function that does not vary greatly from one expert
to another. Higher values indicate experts who provided tighter (more informative)
uncertainty ranges. However, there is here, and usually, an inverse relationship
between informativeness and statistical accuracy: experts who are too narrow or too
precise with their uncertainty judgements tend to ‘miss the target’ too frequently and
their performance scores are penalised as a consequence. On the other hand, the goal
is to identify those experts who are both informative and statistically accurate. This is
usually a minority of a group, and such persons are not identifiable a priori on common
grounds such as professional standing; the best uncertainty assessors are discovered
only after calibration. The DM has a low information score compared to individual
experts, and this is the price paid for the DM’s superior statistical accuracy. As noted
above, it is well-established that individual experts tend to under-estimate true variable
uncertainties (Lin & Bier 2008), and pooling via the DM redresses this trait. The
combination DM out-performs the best single expert and provides a set of target item
solutions that is superior to any single expert.

252

257

Individual expert’s relative performance scores (column 5 in Table 1) are computed
from the products of their p-value and information scores per item, and are unnormalised. When the DM is included as a synthetic expert, performance scores are
adjusted and normalised to sum to unity across the group (with DM included). These
are the relative weights (column 6 in Table 1) that are used in the Classical Model for
combining judgements on target items.

Two experts (E09 & E10) jointly achieve the best statistical accuracy scores (0.182);
their judgment influences are differentiated in the analysis by their different
information scores – one is more informative than the other and is consequently
rewarded with a marginally higher overall weight than the other (see two rightmost
black points on Figure 1).

Prior to the main elicitation and before 1st June we asked the experts to forecast the
proportion of returning pupils and teachers on two dates (1st and 15th June). When
completing these forecasts some teachers indicated that their estimates and ranges
were based on surveys of parents before 1 June, conducted for planning purposes. As
such, these percentages did not represent personal judgements, sensu
stricto. However, absent comments from other teachers, it was not possible to know
how general pre-return surveys were, or how many respondents had provided
percentages data based on similar surveys. Thus, for the purposes and goal of our
elicitation exercise, we chose to regard all the inputs on the percentages of pupils
returning as representing objective, informed judgements and treated them uniformly
when processing the entire group’s responses.

The forecasts were received before or by 27th May 2020. There was a wide range of
responses (Figure 2 and Table 2), indicating a remarkable diverse set of circumstances
in individual schools and community enthusiasm or lack of enthusiasm for a return to
school. This was borne out by the expert interviews where the actual return had been
highly variable across just six schools driven both by community perception and
school’s mitigation measures. However, when averaged over all of the teachers, the
median forecasts are very close (indeed, for pupil’s attendance, identical) to the
national attendance on 1st June (Table 2). The national attendance on 15th June was
similar to 1st June but had increased by 2nd July to levels similar to those anticipated by
the teachers for 15th June. These results demonstrate the ability of the teachers, as
experts, to make good forecasts and strengthen the belief that the study schools are a
dependable representative sample of primary schools in England.

The six structured interviews strengthened the assessment of the teachers as
thoughtful and careful in thinking through the responses to the questions even thought
they were regarded as challenging. All thought about variations between different
children, differences in the school day, differences between class time and breaks, and
in roles and interactions of staff. Two of the interviewees had consulted with other staff
to help them think about contacts.

largely focus on contacts between persons in schools as epidemiological models use
contact data as a basis for modelling transmission of infection (Danon et al. 2013).
Essentially the greater the number of contacts and the longer the duration of those
contacts the greater the chance of infection transmission.

uncertainty ranges per expert. In several questions the experts are asked a pair of
questions to estimate contact numbers for an individual (Q2a, Q3a, Q5a,Q6a) and then
to requested to estimate the range of contacts considering the variations between
individuals (Q2b, Q3b, Q5b, Q6b). Figure 3 shows examples of responses to some
questions to illustrate variation in responses among the experts. Figure 4 shows the
range graphs for the DM contact distributions, while Figure 5 shows a typical
distribution for an individual child. The amalgamated DM distributions are
characteristically heavy tailed. Figure 6 plots the 5th, mean and 95th values to compare
normal (pre-COVID) and new normal (COVID) times.

The interviews conducted suggested the teachers were largely thinking about how
contacts might vary from day to day, with this being much harder to estimate during
normal times due to the diversity of activities pursued by adults and children. For the
second set of questions the variation between experts was also dependent on the
make-up of the school; for example some schools had special-learning units which
meant some children in the cohort spent only part of the day engaged in mainstream
learning.

Before presenting the responses to specific questions we consider sources of
uncertainty in the results with a focus on the contact data. Some questions concern the
contacts of individuals while others concern variations among groups of individuals.
Each teacher has been asked effectively to make measurements of contacts. The
definition of a contact (conversation at 1 metre for five minutes or more) is challenging
and quite large uncertainty is implicit in making the measurement. The large range for
most experts in the graphs for individuals (Figure 3) represents the accuracy of the
measurement. In the interviews teachers also placed different emphasis on thinking
this through; in some instances 5 minutes of contact was considered a long time for
some children during the course of play-led learning.

In comparing schools and combining experts into a DM two additional sources of
uncertainty arise. First there are likely to be real differences between schools because
of variations in bubble sizes and school characteristics. In all of the interviews the
teachers attested to the strict way in which the bubbles were observed, and thus
influenced their thinking around contacts. Second there is a calibration issue with each
expert working out how to make the measurement. These uncertainties are manifest in
the wide variation of elicited values observed in Figure 3. In normal circumstances faceto-face discussions between experts might have been able to reduce the calibration
effect. In creating the DM we are combining measurement accuracy at schools, real
variations in contacts between schools and significantly different calibrations.

The DM distribution aggregates all these uncertainties and results in markedly skewed
distributions (Figure 4a). Here we take the ratio of the right to the left tail, commonly
termed eccentricity, as an approximate measure of skewness. Table 5 compares the
average eccentricity of the individual experts with the DM eccentricity for several
questions. The conflation of all the uncertainties with a DM distribution leads to a
quantitative description of the uncertainty of the contacts typical or average pupil, but
because it integrates measurement errors, calibration errors and aleatory uncertainty it
is not appropriate for developing an epidemiologically relevant model of contacts.

Epidemiological models of transmission convert contact data into a distribution of
individual Ro values (Brooks-Pollock et al. 2020b). Here we therefore have created a
DM distribution from data on the median contacts that characterize the average person
(Q2a, Q3a, Q5a, Q8a, Q9a, Q10a and Q11a) combined with least and most number of
contacts as tails (Q2b, Q3b, Q5b, Q8b, Q9b, Q10b and Q11b). We interpret least and
most as 1%ile and 99%ile values. The interviews confirmed that some teachers worked
through the 5 and 95 percentiles by thinking of the most extreme values and then
adding even more to account for uncertainty. Thus each expert’s original face-to-face
(a) median is coupled with his or her least & most (b) values, with the latter taken as
1%ile and 99%ile values. All experts inputs are processed to form the joint [1; 50; 99]
DM for these items. The DM distribution is inspected for its 50 %ile value, and for the
corresponding 5 %ile and 95 %ile values, and these are the (c) values reported in Table
4 as Q2c, Q3c, Q5c, Q8c, Q9c, Q10c and Q11c, plus their means.We propose that these
distributions are the most appropriate for transforming into distributions of individual Ro
values for input to epidemiological models.

An important risk mitigation strategy [Q1b] is to form groups of children (bubbles) who
are organized to learn together to limit contacts with many children. The DFE guidelines
issued during the study period were for schools to form bubbles of up to 15 children.
The responses indicated bubbles between 6 and 15 with a mean of 11 (Cohort 1) and 13
(Cohort 2). The response to the question on spacing between bubbles indicated that
each bubble was in a separate room and so these results are not reported as they are
deemed not relevant to the risk of transmission between children in different bubbles
during class time. Teacher interviews substantiated this view, with teacher-teacher
contacts between bubbles being substantially restricted. The interviewees cited this
change of behaviour as one of the most significant in terms of reduction in contacts for
teachers.

We first consider results for contacts of children in normal pre-COVID times (Q2, Q5).
Taking the mean values of 25 contacts for Cohort 1 (Q2a) and 18 contacts for Cohort 2
(Q5a) suggests a minimum of 2.1 and 1.5 contact hours. These values are 30-21% of a
typical school day (~7 hours). The distributions are highly asymmetric with high tail
extending to high contact numbers. This feature shows up both in the upper end of the
distribution for one child (Q2a and Q5a) and for the values for the most contacts (Q2b
and Q5b). The combined central values (Q2c and Q5c) reflect variations among children
indicating that more active child is 2.3 times (Cohort 1) and 3 times (Cohort 2) more
active and the least active child 0.5 (Cohort 1) and 0.3 (Cohort 2) less active than a
typical (mean) child. The results for Cohorts 1 (Q2) and Cohort 2 (Q5) are similar with a
weak indication that younger children have slightly greater contacts compared to older
ones and that older children have a somewhat wider range of activity.

Although our approach is fundamentally different to previous contact survey
approaches, we find comparable results. Datasets on primary age children are sparse
and often out-of-date. Parents are typically surveyed, although those with children can
be included with tailored surveys. The most widely used survey, POLYMOD (Mossong et

al. 2008), gives an average of 14.81 (standard deviation of the mean = 10.89) contacts
per day for the 5-9 age group (N = 661). The Social Contact Survey, conducted in 2010,
collected data within schools from 166 children aged 5-9 years. There, a median of 12
contacts per child was measured (mean 14.6, standard deviation 13.7, 95% percentile
range 4, 40) (Danon et al 2013). Other studies (e.g. Zhang et al. 2020) are based on
smaller sample numbers (a few tens) for primary age children and more recent UK
surveys do not include people under 18 years of age at all (Jarvis et al 2020; Klepac et al
2020). The data in these studies suggest large variations from the mean and a long tail
of high contact individuals. These studies do not report 5th and 95th percentiles on the
contact distributions. The teacher elicited data for pre-COVID times (Q2c and Q5c) are
qualitatively consistent with previous studies.

The contacts between children in new normal time under risk mitigation regimes are
substantially reduced (Figure 6): comparing mean contact numbers are reduced by 53%
for Cohort 1 (Q3a) and 62% for Cohort 2 (Q6a). The latter reduction is slightly less than
the reduction of 74% for adults found by Jarvis et al. (2020). The somewhat greater
reduction in contacts in Cohort 2 compared to Cohort 1 in new normal times, however,
indicates that older children are slightly easier to manage with respect to social
distancing. This interpretation was supported by interviewees. Some thought that older
children were more capable of more sustained (> 5m) social distancing (talking face-toface) in free time, enhanced by reduced contacts engendered by the more formal
layout of the school environment. Young children needed more direct contact due to
the need for comfort or due to accidents. Long tails indicative of a small number of very
active children are still apparent (Q3c and Q6c), but the tails represented by 95th
percentile values are reduced by similar amounts to the means. Division into bubbles
where class sizes were reduced by factors of 2 and 3 are interpreted to be significant
factors in reduction of contacts, corroborated at interview. Much larger decreases in
contacts among children of between 4 and 10 are documented in Zhang et al. (2020) as
a consequence of lockdown. In this case schools were closed and strict lockdown
regimes prevented mixing of children from different families.

The formation of bubbles, however, is unlikely to be the only factor in the decrease in
contacts. Children will naturally form smaller groups in schools due to either
juxtaposition in class or formation of friendship groups that are much smaller than a
classroom (Conlan et al 2011). Thus most contacts will be restricted to a fraction of a
class in normal times, while in bubbles the size of friendship groups will become more
comparable. The interviews indicated, however, that reception classes in particular
were more free flow with gregarious children interacting with sibling groups in other
years as well as their peer group within bubbles. These observations help explain the
significantly smaller reduction in contacts in Cohort 1.

We asked questions about differences between different cohorts (Q4 and Q7). The
responses indicate only weak differences. The data indicate no difference between
nursery and reception age children and a weak indication that Year 1 children have
slightly fewer contacts. However, the uncertainties are large indicating low confidence
in these judgements. Year 6 are not judged to be different to Years 2 to 5. Views about
this were controlled by the idea that children’s behaviour changed gradually and that
within any one peer group this varied between children. Nonetheless there was a fairly
uniform view that there was greater potential to mitigate contact behavior in older

children, that changes in class layout had a strong control on ‘in class’ contacts, and that
younger children tended to play side by side but need more close contact with adults.
The view that younger children are more difficult to manage than older children is
supported though by the responses the greater reduction in contacts for Cohort 2.

The responses indicate that Classroom staff (Cohort 3) have a mean total contact
number of 25 with both children and adults (Q8c). Typically classes in primary school
involve 30 pupils with a single teacher and the same teacher will have ad hoc
interactions with other teachers and staff during the day. Converted into duration of
contacts this equates to a minimum of 2.2 contact hours. Ranges of contacts among
teachers (Q8c) indicate a large variation. Again the results indicate some skewness with
a heavy tail of large contact numbers. The proportion of children and other adults can
be evaluated from Q12 and Q13, noting that the total mean number of contacts from
the answers of 32 (Q12 + Q13) can be compared to 25 (Q8c) indicate consistent
responses. The results indicate contacts involve 65% children and 35% adults.

Approximating contacts for adults (in the expected age ranges of teachers and teaching
assistants) are reported to be about 12-14 per day (Mossong et al. (2008) and
approximately 15-20 per day (Zhang et al. 2020). In the Social Contact Survey, 298
participants were teachers: they reported a median of 18 and mean of 51.2 contacts
per day (Danon et al 2013). The mean of 25 daily contacts in our study is consistent with
the Social Contact Survey results, taking account that school hours are only a part of the
day. The high number of contacts within school hours for normal times indicates the
interaction with their charges.

In new normal times mean daily contacts for Cohort 3 (Q9c) decrease from 25 to 10, a
60% reduction (Figure 6). The reduction in contacts compared to normal times is a
factor of 2.5, compared to between 2.1 (Cohort 1) and 1.5 (Cohort 2) for children. Note
that the mean of 10 is similar to the bubble size of 11-13 (Q1b). The contacts between
adults between normal (Q13) and new normal (Q15) reduces by 80% (Figure 6). This
result is comparable to a 74% reduction in adults found by with Jarvis et al (2020).
These results indicate that teachers are social distancing to a greater extent than
children, limiting close contacts as far as is feasible. Answers to Q9b indicate variations
in the roles of different teachers and effects of tasks like supervising breaks and meal
times. There is still a heavy tail to the responses but this is not as great as for other
responses. In the interviews the teachers perceived that those facing older children
were strongly socially-distanced but those facing younger children were less able to
strictly observe this.

For Cohort 4 the changes between normal (Q10) and new normal times is similar to
Cohort 3, but in general contacts are fewer (by ~ 30%) and reflect different roles of
ancillary staff some of which involved much less interactions with children (e.g.
administrative staff). Responses to Q11 indicate a 64% reduction of contacts in new
normal time (Figure 6), reflecting the deliberate policy of limiting ancillary staff contacts
with children and the efforts of these staff to observe social distancing. Adult to adult
contacts are reduced by 80% between normal and new normal time (Figure 6). At
interview Cohort 4 were uniformly perceived as adults with the greatest change to their
day-to-day contacts in the working day, with some able to be entirely socially distant.
This is similar to the overall reduction in contacts of 20% in the general community
reported in Brooks-Pollock (2020a). Inevitably a school is a work place where overall

adult to adult contacts are inevitable; the daily contacts within school hours are at the
lower end of contact numbers reported in other contact studies (Mossong et al. 2008;

In Figures 4 and 6 the tails of the contact numbers (5th and 95th percentiles) are
compared and the overall reductions in contacts are similar to the mean falling within
the 45%-80% range. The comparison reduction in contacts due to the risk mitigation
arrangements are approximately as effective across the wide range of daily contacts of
individual children, classroom staff and support staff.

We asked about adherence and the response indicates that the experts considered
adherence to be high (Q16). This view is supported by the analysis of the qualitative
parts of the questionnaire related to risk mitigation measure. From the interviews the
string was driven often by thinking about consequences, for children, their families but
also their colleagues. Questions related to understanding risk reduction (Q20, Q21,
Q22) are discussed in the next section.

We asked the Head Teachers about risk mitigation measures that they have put in
place. Questions are listed in Table 4. Reference is made for some topics to literature on
the quantification of the risk being mitigated. Most questions answered, from 23
teachers, except Q1a (21) and Q24 (15). Verbatim individual responses are provided in
appendix 2 where many interesting points and examples of innovation in risk
management, mitigation and reduction are apparent. To augment the elicitation and
survey question answers structured interviews were conducted to help in the
interpretation of the response.

Teachers have attempted to follow the Government guidelines, with respect to school
reopening. Links to guidelines from DfE can be found as footnotes. These guidelines
have been updated regularly so it is not easy to categorically state which guidelines
were followed when teachers completed their elicitations. It is apparent that in
instances where the guidelines are not defined, such as ‘minimising contact and mixing
by altering, as much as possible…’ teachers have typically been very cautious, putting in
measures that go beyond the guidelines. Equally, there are no explicit guidelines related
to the need to ‘wash hands frequently’ and consequently there is considerable variation
in interpretation. One interviewed teacher made the point that the younger children
are in the process of learning, and that learning needs to incorporate the making of
mistakes. Many schools had made a good job of initiating procedures for handwashing
that were age appropriate and encouraged sticking within the guidelines (e.g. no
singing). Teachers have interpreted the guidelines to suit their own settings and then
gone one step further to ensure the safety of their charges. Further comparisons to the
guidelines are included in each section below. The appendix reports all responses and
provides a record of good practice and innovation by the schools which will shared
between the schools.

Answers to Q1a concerning the strategy to reduce close contacts of children were

responders did not answer this question. The Government guidelines recommend

possible with staggered break times. Outdoor activities are recommended where
possible and students are to stay in the same desks and rooms as much as possible. 76%
of responders noted social distancing measures that were being put in place with visual
indicators for children to follow. Over 90% of responders followed the guidelines and
indicated the use of classroom bubbles of varying sizes below the recommended
number of 15. The answer to Q1b (Table 7) indicated that many bubbles were about 10
children. Some have indicated that children will only be in school part time to allow
teachers to accommodate the reduced class sizes.

Other measures included the removal of furniture to allow for more space, rotation of
toys and/or removal of certain play items and lunches taking place in the classroom
(either packed lunches or ‘take-away’ style cartons to remove the need for cutlery). In
line with the guidelines, a third of the responses indicated that learning would be
moved outdoors as much as possible and a similar number noted the need for
individual desks and resources. Around a third of teachers have extrapolated the
guidelines and ensured that student bubbles are allocated their own areas of the
playground, their own toilets or their own lunchtime spaces and over 50% refer to the
suggested staggered break times, start times etc. This was also borne out at interview,
almost all interviewees used the word ‘strict’ to describe their bubble, and indicated
that adults avoided connecting between bubbles.

Unsurprisingly all responders in Q18 concerning cleaning have referred to changes to
the usual cleaning regimes in their school with over 70% making specific reference to
ongoing cleaning throughout the day, highlighting high touch areas such as computers
(3 responses) and toilets (13 responses); this is broadly in line with Government
recommendations2. In the main, deep cleaning is taking place before and/or after
school and reference is made to deep cleaning taking place after classroom bubbles
have used specific areas; Government guidelines recommend thorough cleaning at the
end of the day3 ; 3 responders made specific reference to hard plastic toys being
sterilised in Milton after use following DfE guidelines that recommend that cleaning of
toys takes place between use4 . Some teachers referred to the removal of soft toys and
furnishings in their answer to question 1a). Three responders have referred to their
employment of additional cleaning staff and three have indicated that staff and children
will, themselves, engage in cleaning processes. Several responders noted that classroom
doors will be left open, presumably to avoid the need to touch door handles as
recommended in the Government guidelines5. Some of the responses in the appendix
indicate that some schools have gone beyond the guidelines, such as: bubbles having
their own toilet cubicle and sink; cleaning staff using PPE which are double bagged and

SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces for hours to days (Eslami and Jalili 2020) and
disinfecting surfaces is recommended by major health authorities (WHO 2020).
Exposure via contaminated environmental surfaces appears to be a secondary vector of
transmission; transmission via airborne droplets is more important. There is very little
direct research on SARS-CoV-2 =so studies rely on tests performed on similar viruses, or
other viruses that are hard to kill. Surface disinfection to remove viruses include
Quaternary ammonium, ethyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite
(Henwood 2020). Use of Disinfectants are most effective when used in combination
with ultraviolet and vaporised hydrogen peroxide to neutralise aerosolised virus in the
air column. Quantifying risk reduction as a consequence of regular deep cleaning is
difficult and is notably absent from studies on the role of cleaning (Eslami and Jalili,
2020). If after cleaning virus builds upon surfaces linearly with time to some steady
state level after a few hours then cleaning will might reduce the chances of infection
through touching contaminated surfaces.

Answers to Q19 were consistent and included implementing staggered times, one-way
systems, different entrances, no adults on site and no playground meeting. Other than
different entrances for individual groups, these measures follow Government
recommendations6: 65% of responders indicated a staggered drop off and collection
time for children by either year group or class bubbles. 2 further teachers noted the
challenges this puts in place for family groups and had amended their policy
accordingly. 39% had put in place one-way systems to reduce contact between
parent/children arriving and those leaving (at drop off and collection times). 52% noted
that parents were either not allowed on the school site or that only one parent could
drop the child off, with teachers meeting children at the school gates. 48% referred to
social distancing measures being put in place for parents waiting and/or for children in
the playground. Approximately 20% referred to children not being allowed in the
playground at the start of the school day and needing to go straight to class and a
further 20% referred to classes and bubbles having separate entrances and exits.

Accurate quantification of the risk reduction gain from such measures is difficult. A
scoping calculation, however, can give an indicative estimate. If the average parent has
a daily contact hours of 30 (Danon et al. 2013) then the mitigation measures described
might reduce the contact hours by 1 or 2 hours compared to normal mixing associated
with delivering children to and from school, so we estimate an overall effect of a few
percent (~3-6%), which can be compared to the 80% reduction associated with general
lockdown (Brooks Pollock et al. 2020). The contribution to risk reduction within schools
is likely to be very small, but larger and tangible in the wider community.

Responses to the question on weather (Q20) indicate that contacts were not changed
between indoors and outdoors. It is now widely thought that outdoors is much less
risky than indoors but this was not the question. Interviews indicated that the physical

In relation to handwashing (Q21) Government guidelines recommend that adults and
children should frequently wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds and
dry thoroughly7. Responses (Table 7) gave a range from 3 to 13, with over half opting
for a range between 3 and 10 handwashes. One teacher referred to the number of
handwashes being dependent on the number of visits to the toilet. Those teachers who
gave a specific lower number with a wider range have implemented a policy of
handwashing at certain times with variance added for toilet visits (one responder has
indicated scheduled handwash times). All responses are shown in the elicitation results.

There is limited evidence on the efficacy of handwashing in reducing transmission. Soap
is very effective at neutralising the virus (Eslami and Jalili, 2020). The chances of an
infectious individual passing the virus by touching a person or contaminating a surface
are reduced by regular hand washing. The weight of evidence is that handwashing
reduces transmission but may become counterproductive, less effective and even
harmful if the handwashing becomes excessive. Risk reduction is estimated as 6% to
44% for respiratory diseases (Rabie and Curtis, 2006). Beale et al (2020) studied risk
reduction of handwashing for flu and common coronavirus infections in the UK. They
estimate significant reduction for between 6 and 10 handwashes per day (5th per = 58%;
50th per = 36%; 95th per = 1%), results consistent with those of Rabie and Curtis, 2006).
A reservation for these studies is that they involve extrapolation to transmission of
SARS-CoV-2. This distribution is included in the risk modelling. The range in the elicited
answers indicate that most schools have adopted an optimal regime of hand washing
too reduce risk and have avoided excessive handwashing that are considered to be
potentially harmful.

The schools follow Government guidelines for those displaying COVID19 symptoms
(Q22), but some schools have gone beyond these recommendations. In general anyone
showing symptoms is self-isolated with some mentioning designated areas set aside for
this purpose. A few will use of PPE, which is recommended if the adult cannot keep 2 m
apart. The symptomatic persons are then sent home immediately and asked to get
tested. School areas are then cleaned following the guidelines8 to use PPE. Two
responders plan to notify families of children in a bubble. One school proposed that
everyone in that bubble would be recommended to get a test and, if it comes back
positive, the whole bubble is required to self-isolate for 14 days. The individual stays at
home for 7 days or until a negative test is achieved. One responder has said that if a
positive test is confirmed the whole school will close. For case where infection is
suspected outside school hours, those that answered required the school to be
informed, a test will be undertaken, and the school notified of the result. A small
number mentioned that the person showing symptoms would not be able to attend
until a negative test was achieved. One responder stated that a positive test would
result in self-isolation of the whole bubble for 14 days. Only a few responded to the

policy for dealing with anyone with symptoms identified outside of school. Most
interviewees had experienced at least one instance of a suspected case that required
testing. While the protocols all required that the child stayed away from school, the
responses varied in terms of the notification or isolation of the child’s bubble until test
result was received. The DfE guidance states that the bubbles only close if a positive
test is returned but one school will require immediate self-isolation until results come
back.

The structured interviews augmented these findings from the risk mitigation survey, but

social distancing and key educational objectives of learning and developing social skills
was highlighted. There was comment that some measures would be impossible or much

Discussion.

677

The circumstances in English primary schools in June and July 2020 are unprecedented
and unlikely to be repeated. The partial re-opening of schools was undertaken under
strict guidelines of social distancing and a range of risk mitigation methods to reduce
the transmission of COVID-19. These unique circumstances provide an opportunity to
evaluate the efficacy of different risk reduction strategies and to add to the data on
contact patterns for young children and staff in the school environment.

682

A striking aspect of our results is that the 34 participating schools proved to be
representative of schools nationwide. Thus as in opinion polls an accurate picture of
what is happening in nationally in schools can be gleaned from a modest sample size.
We were fortunate here that volunteerism led to a group of schools covering a wide
range of sizes and communities. Even though the schools individually predicted and

then reported a very wide range of returns for pupil and teacher attendance on 1st June
the average for the 36 schools was very close to the national picture. The prescience of
experienced school leaders could be used to anticipate what will happen in September
when a full return to school has been mandated by Government.

Breaking social networks is a key non-pharmaceutical intervention for countering the
spread of infectious disease. Our study indicates that contacts within schools were
reduced in the range 45% to 80% (Figure 5). These strikingly successful outcomes
highlight the tremendous work of school staff and the role of greatly reduced class sizes
through creation of bubbles of children which are much less than normal class sizes.
Although the marked reduction in contacts can be partly explained by much smaller
class sizes observations indicate that social groups are characteristically smaller than
typical class sizes under normal times (Conlan et al. 2011) Thus organisation of children
within bubbles of groups combined with control of their behaviour by teaching staff is a
significant factor. A combination of 3/7 of children being invited back to school and
limited parental compliance returning eligible children to school on 1st June (30-40%)
led to typically only 15-20% of children being present. This allowed schools to form
bubble sizes significantly less the 15 DfE guidelines (range 7 to 16 with median of 11).
Contact numbers do not scale linearly with group size and the number of contacts
saturates at about 20 (Brooks Pollock et al 2020b). The bubble sizes of about 10 have
proved to be efficacious in decreasing contacts, limiting mixing between children and
thus reducing risk of transmission.

The elicited data can be compared quantitively with other kinds of contact survey data
because of the variation in methodologies. The results indicate the same kind of
heterogeneity as documented in Danon et al. (2013) in which the data are a mixture of
individual contacts involving significant conversations at a distance of 3 m or less or
touching plus contacts related to groups where each person in a group counts as a
contact. Results were expressed as contacts per day and total contact hours, noting that
the latter parameter can exceed 24 hours because contacts within groups occur
simultaneously. In a school setting, classroom adults (Cohort 3) have a median of 26
contacts (Q8a), of which about 2/3’s are with children (Q12) and 1/3 with adults (Q13).
The distance specified in the question is 1 m with social distancing at the time of
elicitation being 2 m. Contact hours are of the order of 2 hours.

726
727
728

In the context of a typical class of 30 the group definition of contacts in Danon et al.
(2013) seems less relevant. There must be an additional risk factor related to being in
an enclosed space with widespread aerosol circulation, but this is not quantifiable with

between normal and new normal times. The contacts of teaching staff (Cohort 3)
decreases by 50% between normal and new normal times indicating that adults can
more effectively adopt stringent social distancing practices. A reduction in contacts of
about 80% is also approximately the average achieved in the UK at the height of the
lockdown (Brooks-Pollock et al 2020b). Given that mixing with groups of children is part
of the job of class-room staff the reduction is impressive. Likewise other adult staff
achieved similar reductions in contacts. The data also confirm that older children
(Cohort 2) are easier to manage than younger children (Cohort 1) with more than a
two-fold greater reduction of contacts in the older children compared to the younger
ones.

the elicitation data. However, reducing class sizes from 30 to roughly 10 reduces the
random risk of an infectious person being in the class-room by about 1/3.

731
732
733
734

All of the risk mitigation strategies contribute to reduction of risk. Specific risk
management strategies reflect individual circumstances in schools. Many relate to steps
which are likely to reduce contacts and disrupt break contact networks. Each of the risk
mitigation measures will contribute to risk reduction, but this is hard to quantify.

735
736
737
738
739
740

It seems unlikely that the significant reduction of risk, implied by these results, can be
maintained with a full return to school without greatly expanding the accommodation
to maintain reduced class sizes, as suggested by the factor of 2 to 3 reduction in
contacts between children. Adult staff can continue to observe strict social distancing
behaviours and can continue to organise the classroom and break times which reduces
contacts.

Table 3. Quantitative elicitation questions
Number Question
1b
If you use bubbles please describe the number of pupils in a bubble and the
approximate spacing between bubbles during class time. The opportunity is
given to give separate answers for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.
2a
How many people does a typical11 Cohort 1 child come into face to face
contact with (conversation within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) on a
normal school day in a covid free world?
2b
Thinking about the behaviour of individual children12 give a range of contacts
for Cohort 1 children around your central answer to Q2a for normal times.
3a
How many people does a typical Cohort 1 child come into face to face
contact with (conversation within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) on a new
normal school day?
3b
Thinking about the behaviour of individual children give a range of contacts
for Cohort 1 children around your central answer to Q3a for new normal
times.
4
Do you think that there is any significant difference13 in the contacts made
by nursery, reception and year 1 children? If yes, please indicate the likely
difference in contact referenced to reception age children. Put a percentage
to indicate a difference (either way); for example you might judge that year 1
children have 80% of the contacts of a reception child.
5a
How many people does a typical Cohort 2 child come into face to face
contact with (conversation within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) on a
normal school day?
5b
Thinking about the behaviour of individual children, give a range of contacts
for Cohort 2 children around your central answer to Q5b for normal times.
6a
How many people does a typical Cohort 2 child come into face to face
contact with (conversation within 1 metre) on a new normal school day?
6b
Thinking about the behaviour of individual children, give a range of contacts
for Cohort 2 children around your central answer to Q6a for new normal
times.
7
Do you think that there is any difference in the contacts made by Year 2-5
children compared to Year 614. If yes please indicate the likely difference in
contact referenced to year 6 age children. Put a percentage to indicate a
difference (either way); for example you might judge that year 2 to 5 children
have 120% or 80% of the contacts of a Year 6 child.
8a
How many people (both children and other adults) does a Cohort 3 adult
come into face to face contact (within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) with
on a normal school day?
11

In this and subsequent similar questions you are being asked about the typical or average behaviour and
your uncertainty in this average or typical behaviour.
12
This question and subsequent similar questions you are asked to think about the extreme behaviours of
individuals in your school.
13

It seems likely to us that there will be little difference in the behavior and management regime for very young
children but this is an opportunity for you to disagree.
14
Numbers, character and organisation of year 2 to 5 (emergency workers and vulnerable children) may differ from
year 6 affecting contacts. This question might not be relevant to some schools

Thinking about the behaviour of individual Cohort 3 adults, give a range of
contacts for Cohort 3 adults around your central answer to Q8a for normal
times.
How many people (both children and other adults) does a Cohort 3 adult
come into contact (within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) with on a new
normal school day??
Thinking about the behaviour of individual Cohort 3 adults, give a range of
contacts for Cohort 3 adults around your central answer to Q9a for new
normal times.
How many people (both adults and children) does a Cohort 4 adult come
into face to face contact (within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) with on a
normal school day?
Thinking about the behaviour of individual cohort 4 adults give a range of
contacts around your central answer to Q10a for normal times.
How many people (both adults and children) does a Cohort 4 adult come into
face to face contact (within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) with on a new
normal school day?
Thinking about the behaviour of individual cohort 4 adults give a range of
contacts around your central answer to Q16 for new normal times.
How many children does an adult (from both Cohort 3 and 4) have
physical/face-to-face contact (within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) during a
typical day, in normal times?
How many adults does an adult (from both Cohort 3 and 4) have
physical/face-to-face contact (within 1 metre for 5 minutes or more) with
during a typical day, in normal times?
How many children does an adult have physical/face-to-face contact (within
1 metre for 5 minutes or more) with during a typical day, in new normal
times?
How many adults does an adult have physical/face-to-face contact (within 1
metre for 5 minutes or more) with during a typical day, in new normal times?
Adherence. All schools will seek to provide a safe environment following
guidelines (e.g. DFE) where feasible and from their own management
decisions. Of course some recommendations and procedures may be easier
to adhere to than others. We would like your assessment of the extent to
which your school is able to follow guidelines. 100% means perfect
adherence while 0% means no adherence at all. We have left some space
below if you want to make any comments on the any factors that make it
difficult to reach 100%
Weather might affect the ability to socially distance and being outdoors is
recognised as being less risky than indoors. Estimate the increase in number
of contacts as a percentage increase among children as a consequence of
bad weather. (e.g. an answer of 30% will indicate the number of contacts
increase by this percentage due to play breaks being inside)
How many times a day do your children wash their hands? Give a range if
applicable

Table 6. Questions related to risk mitigation.
Question
1a
Please describe your strategy to reduce close contacts between pupils
(about 50 words). You might want to discriminate between Cohort 1 and 2
above.
18
Describe briefly the cleaning regime in your school using disinfectant
(maximum 50 words)
19
Describe the policy for parents to drop off and pick up their children each
day (50 words maximum).
20
Weather might affect the ability to socially distance and being outdoors is
recognised as being less risky than indoors. Estimate the increase in
number of contacts as a percentage increase among children as a
consequence of bad weather. (e.g. an answer of 30% will indicate the
number of contacts increase by this percentage due to play breaks being
inside)
21
How many times a day do your children wash their hands? Give a range if
applicable
22
What is your policy if a child or adult staff develops possible COVID19
symptoms (either outside school or during school hours) (50 words
maximum)?
23
What is your policy if a parent or another relative of a child contracts
COVID19?
24
Other Comments. Please make any remarks about additional risk factors
that you think should be considered (maximum 100 words).
