Abstract
Objectives:

A key measure to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been social

distancing. Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process

between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover

elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians’ experience of

using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design:

qualitative content analysis

Setting:

PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

Subjects:

PICU Physicians

Interventions:

Due to the pandemic, the hospital’s PICU used Zoom® as a remote

conferencing application, instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review

board approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1, 2020 to July 14, 2020).

Measurements:

Demographic data and narrative descriptions of the perceived efficacy of

remote handover were collected using open-ended questions through a created online link.

The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction.

Main Results:

All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the

survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. They

had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were

comfortable conducting a remote endorsement. Most found that Situation–Background–

Assessment–Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this

remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer

interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived

disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual

meetings.

Conclusions:

Video-conferencing applications used for online handovers could supplement

traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient endorsement during outbreaks of

infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be

encouraged to optimize the users’ experience.

Introduction
Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared in March

2020 (1), healthcare systems worldwide became under unprecedented burden of optimizing

care delivery to massive numbers of patients with COVID-19 while protecting healthcare

workers (HCWs) from contracting the disease. Furthermore, social distancing measures that

were an integral part of the pandemic control needed to be incorporated into the medical

care system (2). The rapid spread of the disease, the increasing number of cases and

associated mortality, and the lack of therapeutic and vaccine options prompted many

governments and health authorities to implement strict measures to combat the pandemic.

These include community lockdown, travel and movement restrictions, and cancelation of

events and non-essential gatherings (3). Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),

disrupting the chain of transmission is considered key to stopping the spread of severe

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the evolving pandemic,

various strategies should be implemented in the healthcare system and at the local hospital

setting (4-7). Healthcare settings can be an important source of viral transmission, and

hence, special attention should be given to minimizing the transmission of infections to

patients and among HCWs, especially during such a pandemic (8-15).

A key measure to mitigate the spread of SARS-COV-2 has been social distancing to

reduce the probability of contact between infected and noninfected individuals (16). The

safety of hospitalists and other frontline HCWs is paramount for preventing nosocomial

transmission, as reported in several countries (17-19). Much effort to date has focused on

maintaining the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). However, another essential

strategy for preventing nosocomial transmission is to implement “physical distancing” and

avoid close contact with others. While this approach has received considerable pressure

regarding implementation in communities, implementing social or physical distancing

measures between HCWs is challenging due to the nature of their job. Still, physical

distancing is a critical way of preventing nosocomial transmission and ensuring workforce

welfare (20). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined “prolonged” exposure

to patients with COVID-19 as a cumulative time of 15 or more minutes in 24 h and close

contact as being within 6 ft of a person with confirmed COVID-19 or having unprotected

direct contact with infectious secretions or excretions of the person with confirmed COVID-

19 (20).

One fundamental hardship of physical distancing is conducting routine clinical care,

including rounds, sign-out, or multidisciplinary rounds. Virtual rounds enable clinicians,

including residents and attendings, to work together and plan daily care without crowding

into patient rooms. This is the most important cultural hurdle that one may face, given the

myriad clinical interactions occurring within teams in the hospital; thus, such distancing can

be challenging (21).

Effective patient handovers are critical for patient care and safety. This is even more

crucial with the restriction of junior doctors’ working hours, resulting in more patient

handovers and consequently a greater potential for communication disintegration. The

diversity of handover practices with their variable quality and structure can translate to

medical errors, treatment delays, and additional tests, resulting to longer hospitalizations

and low provider and patient satisfaction (22).

Verbal handovers are often incomplete, with the omission of pertinent information,

coupled with poor retention of information by the incoming care provider (23). Electronic

handover tools have been reported to help overcome the deficits of the variable and

unstructured forms of clinical handover (24).

As multidisciplinary rounds typically occur either at the bedside or in a conference

room, promoting to perform them virtually whenever possible during an infectious disease

outbreak through either conference calls or video chats is vital (21).

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the handover process in our pediatric intensive care

unit (PICU) between physicians involved all previous on-call physicians and all PICU on-

service physicians, with an average of 10–12 doctors sitting together in the PICU nurses’

station to endorse all PICU patients in the early morning. With the COVID-19 crisis and social

distancing implementation, a remote handover process was introduced in our hospital on

May 14, 2020, where all physicians are in various physical locations in the hospital

(Appendix 1).

This study evaluates the feasibility and describes the experience of complete video-

conferencing for handover between PICU physicians in a tertiary care academic hospital.

Methods
Study design:

This study is a qualitative deductive thematic content analysis of the narrative

responses from HCWs in the PICU.

Setting:

The physician staffing of the PICU at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)

consists of six consultants, eight registrars, 4–6 rotating residents from the pediatric

department per month, and two PICU fellows. All these physicians, along with nurses, one

pharmacist, one clinical dietician, and respiratory therapists, work to serve 15 ventilated

PICU beds.

Sampling and recruitment:

All PICU physicians were invited via email to participate in this study. The email was

sent on July 1, 2020, with one follow-up reminder after 1 week.

Data collection:

Data were collected online through the SurveyMonkey platform. Open-ended

questions were used, and probing was encouraged using questions such as “Why?,” “Can

you give an example?,” and “Can you provide details to your answer?.”

The survey started with questions on demographic information (e.g., position,

specialty, gender, and age). Then, general questions on identifying obstacles and facilitators

of the online handover of care were introduced using probing. Additionally, satisfaction with

the Situation–Background–Assessment–Recommendation (SBAR) communication

framework was assessed by encouraging the respondents to elaborate and give examples

that help understand the identified level of satisfaction of each element.

Data analysis:

The first step in the analysis involved reading and familiarization of the participants’

range of responses. Categories were established, and two authors (NA and MT) developed

codes independently. NA, an expert in qualitative methodology working in family and

community medicine, introduced an etic perspective of the topic, while MT, a PICU

consultant, introduced an emic perspective.

The developed codes were similar and were discussed before a consensus on the

coding frame was established. All themes were

a priori themes; however, the range of

responses under each subtheme was derived from the data.

Qualitative data management was conducted using NVivo 10.

After obtaining institutional review board approval, we invited PICU physicians of

KSUMC, who have been performing remote handovers using Zoom® since May 15, 2020, to

describe their experience through a qualitative, prestructured survey.

Data entry was performed electronically. Content analysis was used to analyze the

participants’ responses. The results were used as a part of the quality improvement project

and shared with the Pediatric Department Quality Committee.

Results
Thirty-seven physicians responded to the open-ended questions on using Zoom® for

the handover of care between physicians in the PICU (Table 1). The participants comprised

six consultants, nine specialists, and 22 residents. Most (86.5%) had previous experience

with the implemented Zoom platform (Table 2), and approximately two-thirds also had

previous teleconferencing experience in webinars or online learning activities. Furthermore,

78.4% of the participants (n = 29) reported that they were comfortable conducting such

handover through Zoom or other similar applications (Figure 1).

The analysis of the responses revealed two main themes: online and face-to-face

endorsement and the influence of online endorsement on quality of care.

Online and face-to-face endorsement:

The participants’ views on the advantages and disadvantages of Zoom endorsement

over the classic face-to-face endorsement varied. Most participants found that online

endorsement is better than face-to-face endorsement due to time and flexibility, which

were also seen by others as factors hindering proper communication among members of

the team. For example, Participant 29 who attended four Zoom endorsements noted that

“

Zoom endorsement is less time-consuming due to fewer interruptions,” whereas

Participant 25 who attended the same number of online endorsements explained that

“

Time is shorter with face-to-face endorsement compared with remote endorsement.” This

was explained by Participant 3 who mentioned that “

Sometimes, due to connection errors, it

takes more time…face-to-face is usually quicker because there is no disruption of connection
and difficulty hearing.”

Regarding the flexibility of use, Participant 22 explained that “

Even if you are late for

some reason, you can join the meeting at any place, focusing and writing your own notes.”
Furthermore, physicians who are not on-call may find it easy to participate in Zoom

endorsement: “

Sharing information of the patient to all interested (physicians) even not on-

call.”
However, some other participants believed that issues including “

less interaction” and “less

teaching” are encountered using online methods.
Describing face-to-face endorsement, Participant 5 noted that “

You can see

nonverbal communication like facial expression, hand gesture, eye-to-eye contact whereas,
with Zoom, you cannot if the cameras are off.” Team members do not use cameras during
Zoom endorsement. Participant 4, a resident, noted that “

It wasn't comfortable as the

classical way, in terms of sharing the information without seeing that the other team
understood or listened to what you said.” The latter participant had suggested using
cameras to increase the reliability of Zoom endorsement. In addition, Participant 4 noted

that “

Video calls between teams would be more comfortable.” However, on their practice of

sharing images as needed during Zoom endorsement, Participant 7 commented that “

I can

share data as X-ray reports, and many subspecialties can attend and share their experience.”
The participants were concerned about teaching, and they commented on that as

part of the attributes of working at the PICU in a university hospital, as Participant 18, a

PICU specialist, mentioned that “

Teaching of residents is minimal during endorsement.”

However, few participants observed no difference in using both manners.

Influence of online endorsement on quality of care:

Responses revealed the participants' views on the effect of online endorsement on

the quality of patient care and endorsements.

Quality of patient care

Although some participants (n = 12) believed that the quality of work and patient

care was not affected by online endorsement compared with face-to-face endorsement,

others perceived some positive (n = 15) or negative (n = 9) effects.

The quality of the work environment and patient care was maintained using Zoom

endorsement. Participant 20 mentioned that “

Remote endorsement has achieved the main

goal of social distancing. Optimum patient care is being achieved with a smaller number of
healthcare workers, attending consultant can attend the handover; so earlier decisions could
be offered.” Participant 32 added that "I believe it (Zoom endorsement) will definitely
improve patient care. Since I will get the information I need without having to worry about
running late and missing some information/updates about the patient.”
In addition to “

less noise,” Participant 28 believed that not conducting the

endorsement at the bedside decreased the interruptions from individuals outside the PICU

team during rounds and reported that “

One advantage of remote endorsement is the

avoidance of interruptions from family members or other teams which could happen in faceto-face endorsement.”
Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, Participant 9, a consultant, noted the following

about the quality of the work environment due to online endorsement: “

Decreasing the

stress among HCWs during COVID-19 crisis and decreasing the possible contact with other
asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 carriers. So, we have a more sustainable healthcare workforce to
take care of more PICU patients.”

Alternatively, some participants believed that “

missed information and discussions”

are commonly observed during online endorsement. However, three participants observed

that revising the patient’s status is the senior’s responsibility, regardless of the information

shared during the endorsement. Participant 3 noted that “…

I don't think it does (effect

patient care) because the PICU seniors always revise their patients thoroughly.”
Participant 5, a resident, felt that sometimes, the low online attendance might

negatively affect the quality of patient care and noted that “

Less number of Zoom attendees

will have a smaller number of doctors who will critique or ask questions during the
endorsement, less chance for the exchange of views and opinions.”
Furthermore, clinical assessment of the patient can be compromised due to remote

endorsement. For example, Participant 15 said that “

Most of the physicians will look all the

time to a computer for endorsement and patient follow-up without assessing patients
clinically.”
While accepting the adverse effects of online endorsement on the overall work

environment, some physicians denied this effect on patient care. Participant 27 noted that

“

With the constraints enumerated above, there is always the possibility of

miscommunication.” However, when asked if that affects the quality of patient care,
Participant 27 responded that “

Patient care is the same with the face-to-face endorsement.”

Connectivity issues have further influenced the quality of patient care. Participant 3,

a resident, mentioned that “

Sometimes, there are active patients and the time is not

enough; we once had a patient who was a case of pulmonary embolism, she was very active,
85% of the time was spent talking about her condition, and we went over the other patients
very quickly because of Zoom limited connectivity issues.”

Quality of online communication:

The descriptive analysis of the SBAR communication tool is shown in Figure 2.

Among the 37 participants, 13 provided details based on which they have chosen their SBAR

communication tool evaluation.

Most participants were satisfied with the quality of communication using online

applications, whereas others were less satisfied with the quality of communication for

various reasons. The following shows the participants’ responses to each element of the

SBAR communication tool.

Situation:

Most participants agreed that the explanation of the situation of each patient

endorsed during online endorsement was clear and explicit. Participant 8, a PICU specialist,

mentioned that “

We simply can describe the situation to all registrars and residents and also

to consultants in their homes.”
Some other participants noted no difference between the classic face-to-face

endorsement and the online one, as the latter does not influence the endorsement

It’s (the situation element) fully

contents. Participant 28, a PICU consultant, noted that “

achieved because it’s the way we used to do it, either face-to-face or remotely.”
Alternatively, few participants believed that providing a concise statement of the problem

The rotator

during endorsement is overestimated, as Participant 27, a resident, noted that “

will usually present the case, and if the PICU on-call feels that information was not enough,
he/ she fills the gap.”

Background:

Most participants believed that the patients’ background information is well

communicated during online endorsement and understood the importance of this element,

especially during the high turnover of patients due to COVID-19 admissions. For example,

Participant 4, a resident, explained that “

Because of the new COVID situation, some of the

team members would not be aware what happened to the patient last week except through
this Zoom meeting…”
The participants did not observe a difference in the quality of endorsing background

information between online and face-to-face endorsements. Participant 32 mentioned that

“

Detailed background could be obtained through remote handover” Participant 20

"The background information of the patient is the first thing we mention during
endorsement, so it is well achieved.”
Nevertheless, few participants thought that a high-quality sharing of background

information was partially achieved due to the following: Participant 28 mentioned that “

It's

(background information of the patient) partially achieved because sometimes we lose
attention and get some background information lost. While in face-to-face, we are less likely
to be distracted.” In addition, Participant 31 noticed “Some missed information.” Participant
31 believed that sharing background information was partially achieved and had not put the

responsibility to fill the missing information on the on-call team.

Assessment:

Like the aforementioned SBAR tool elements, most participants believed that the

assessment findings of the patients were well communicated via online endorsement.

Participant 3 said that “

(Patient) assessment of the previous team is always mentioned.”

Furthermore, the participants explained some reasons that facilitated the perceived

quality of communication of the team assessment of the patients. For example, Participant

9, a consultant, stated that “

Assessment was clear and backed with some radiological

images or other documents sharing through (Zoom® platform).”
However, some participants believed that communicating the assessment element is

difficult to achieve through online endorsement as this depends heavily on in-person clinical

Proper assessment needs

evaluation. For instance, Participant 20, a specialist, noted that “

more than virtual handover, needs personal assessment and clinical examination.”

Recommendation:

Some participants were satisfied with the quality of communication of

recommendations during Zoom endorsement. For example, Participant 3 noted that “

Plans

and what to follow-up are clear.”
Moreover, another participant added that consultants’ availability to inform the

team about and discuss recommendations is essential and easy to maintain during online

endorsement. Participant 8, a specialist, mentioned that “

We can take recommendations

directly from the consultant remotely.”
Alternatively, Participant 20, a consultant, believed that the elements of the SBAR

communication tool are connected. As he believed that a proper assessment is lacking, he

noted according to his experience that “

Due to incomplete assessment, an effective plan

couldn't be suggested properly.”
Furthermore, some participants believed that most recommendations in the PICU do

not require optimum communication skills, as Participant 32, a resident, mentioned that

“

This is partially achieved because we don't really request anything during endorsement

other than mentioning that the patient should be seen by neurology team, for instance.”
Noteworthy, since the initiation of this remote handover process among the PICU

physicians from May 15, 2020 to February 15, 2021, contact tracing in our PICU infection

control reported only one physician who had a COVID-19-positive polymerase chain

reaction result, which was community-acquired. Incidentally, among the other PICU team

members who are not using the remote endorsement process, seven nurses (3 of them

nosocomial) and two respiratory therapists (one nosocomial) were COVID-19 positive during

this period.

Discussion
As part of the preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons from similar

outbreaks have helped establish known preventive measures; infection prevention and

control strategies were developed and revised as the pandemic evolved and transmission

and exposure information grew. As part of hospital preparedness for the large influx of

infected patients, healthcare facilities were challenged with the limited number of airborne

infection isolation rooms and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (25, 26). Hence, additional

measures were introduced within hospitals, including universal masking and social

distancing. Although social distancing has been a well-established mitigation measure in

community settings (16), its effects were relatively unknown within hospital settings.

Emerging evidence at the beginning of the pandemic showed that social distancing was a

vital component of infection prevention to reduce nosocomial outbreaks. Subsequently,

many academic hospitals implemented social distancing during educational and

administrative meetings, clinical workrooms, rounds, sign-out, and multidisciplinary rounds.

Subsequently, public health authorities issued guidelines for COVID-19 infection prevention

in the workplace, which emphasized social distancing (27, 28).

Tele-critical care reduces cost and improves the quality of care using low-cost, off-

the-shelf, synchronous, video-teleconferencing devices, along with remote access to

electronic medical records, imaging studies, and lab results (29). Video-conferencing

technologies, such as FaceTime®, Zoom®, and Skype®, were utilized to assist in family

discussions and goals of care settings at the end of life in PICUs during the COVID-19

pandemic (30). Therefore, we theorized that implementing a similar system during the

pandemic could maintain the standard of ICU patient care while enabling more social

distancing measures.

The handover of patients is critical of any hospital care, especially in settings with

complex patients when multiple professions contribute to patient care.

In addition, unambiguous and precise communication is provided by face-to-face

communication (31). However, virtual endorsements using applications, such as Zoom®,

make attending a session easier. Alternatively, low attendance might be of concern when

using this technique.

A study has shown unanimous satisfaction of the participating neonatologists,

nurses, and the infection control team (32). In one study, physicians felt that their clinical

decisions might be negatively impacted by inappropriate health information using online

tools (33). The satisfaction of the team involved is of immense help to sustain and improve

virtual handover.

One of the participants in this study highlighted the avoidance of family members

during the pandemic. However, note that the patient’s or family members’ presence may

enrich the handover as they provide valuable input (34). Virtual huddles to enhance staff

communication about patients had been used in ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, it was feared that the speedy adaptation of virtualization might pose the risk of

decreasing the quality of clinical care (35, 36). On the contrary, one study has shown that

virtual programs may provide additional inpatient capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic

(37).

Most participants in this study were comfortable using Zoom® or other similar

applications in the handover process, which could be related to their previous experience in

using these tools. Lowe and Shen have reported their emergency department’s rapid

adaptation of telemedicine network using off-the-shelf products with Apple iPads running

22

Zoom, a familiar system for end-users for physical distancing, reducing high-risk contacts

and conserving PPE (38).

However, the use of video cameras throughout the handover process could have

intensified the team’s reliability and engagement. This needs further exploration and

emphasis, as body language is an integral component in the communication process. Paying

attention to the types of nonverbal communication in face-to-face handovers and educating

HCWs could improve the quality and reliability of these practices (39).

In this study, the participants find communication and elaboration difficult in online

endorsement, which may make achieving a quality online endorsement difficult; however,

the so-called electronic ICUs have been established during the COVID-19 crisis to enable

clinicians to monitor the clinical status of up to 100 patients spontaneously, provide them

rapid access to subspecialty consultation, and allow the continued ability of quarantined

staff to continue their work remotely (40).

Even though most participants were post-graduate residents, one possible limitation

is their high turnaround, and they may not grasp the whole experience. Implementing

virtual handover and telemedicine at other clinical areas within the scope of their rotations

may provide additional experience and perspective, which should be further evaluated.

Residents’ and trainees’ opinions on Zoom’s use in the clinical practice during the COVID-19

crisis were wildly varied, which is common in narrative analyses (41). A recent cross-

sectional survey that evaluated post-graduate residents’ knowledge on infection prevention

and control practices did not show any difference in overall knowledge by age, residency

year, or rotating department (42).

Some of our training residents thought the whole endorsement process does not

affect the patient care in the PICU, thinking that this relates more to the PICU senior staff

23

themselves rather than relating to the trainees. This misconception highlights that training

residents need more education on how proper endorsement affects the quality of patient

care and safety (43). Having all PICU team members share the handover information about

a patient’s current situation, assessments, and care recommendations could prevent near

misses and adverse events (43). Unfortunately, such vital information does not always pass

flawlessly from the previous to the subsequent healthcare providers. The Agency for

Healthcare Research and Quality has reported several gaps in communication between

healthcare providers as the leading cause of preventable medical errors in malpractice

claims affecting emergency physicians and trainees (44).

Some pieces of evidence exist on the effectiveness of SBAR implementation on

patient outcome, but this evidence is limited to specific circumstances, such as

communication over the phone (45). As high-quality studies are still lacking, future studies

are needed to demonstrate the benefit of SBAR in patient safety and keep raising the

awareness of communication errors. SBAR might be an adaptive tool suitable for many

healthcare settings when clear and effective interpersonal communication is required (45).

The current COVID-19 pandemic provides various opportunities for using remote

communication to develop healing human relationships. What we need in a pandemic is not

social distancing, but rather physical distancing with social connectedness (46).

The inherent purpose of a multidisciplinary conference (MDC) is to ensure a thorough

evaluation of each case, regardless of the spectrum of care, whether pretreatment,

treatment, or survivorship (47). This entails ensuring proper diagnosis, staging, treatment

planning, clinical trial enrollment, care coordination, management of treatment

complications, evaluation of disease response, recurrence monitoring, and assessment of

survivorship outcomes. As MDC usage has become more widespread, academic institutions

24

are beginning to evaluate MDC quality measures for guideline adherence and patient

outcomes. Given its impact, MDC has become a standard in pediatric critical care.

A virtual MDC makes attendance easier, particularly for off-site healthcare providers.

This encourages greater participation for community healthcare providers. The virtual

format provides flexibility for on-site healthcare providers as well, promoting attendance.

Images are more easily viewed by both neuroradiologists and MDC participants when a

virtual format is employed. Furthermore, by attending an MDC at their workstation,

healthcare providers have real-time access to patient records, which can be reviewed to

assist with clinical decision making.

Family-centered care is threatened during the COVID-19 pandemic (48). The

participation of family members in a manner that allows families, patients, and the

healthcare team to collaborate is the core of family-centered care. Strategies for delivering

family-centered care typically include the open presence of family members at the bedside.

Restrictions on family presence should not undermine adherence to the principles of family-

centered care. Defining patients’ goals of care is a priority during the pandemic and typically

necessitates family engagement. Therefore, rapidly adapting family-centric procedures and

tools is essential to circumvent restrictions on physical presence. During the COVID-19

pandemic, family presence must be supported in nonphysical ways to achieve family-

centered care (48).

One limitation to our research is the subjective component inherent to this

study design. Another issue is the single center experience, so this could be further explored

in multicenter trials on utilization of similar remote handover applications in the ICUs.

Conclusions
Video-conferencing applications used for online handovers could supplement

traditional face-to-face ICU patient endorsements during infectious disease outbreaks. The

utilization of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to

optimize the users’ experience.
