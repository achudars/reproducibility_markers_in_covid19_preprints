Abstract

This systematic review summarizes the evidence on the earliest patients with COVID-19-HIV
co-infection. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, preprint databases, and
Google Scholar from December 01, 2019 to June 1, 2020. From an initial 547 publications and
75 reports, 25 studies provided specific information on COVID-19 patients living with HIV.
Studies described 252 patients, 80.9% were male, mean age was 52.7 years, and 98% were on
ART. Co-morbidities in addition to HIV and COVID-19 (multimorbidity) included hypertension
(39.3%), obesity or hyperlipidemia (19.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.0%), and
diabetes (17.2%). Two-thirds (66.5%) had mild to moderate symptoms, the most common being
fever (74.0%) and cough (58.3%). Among patients who died, the majority (90.5%) were over 50
years old, male (85.7%), and had multimorbidity (64.3%). Our findings highlight the importance
of identifying co-infections, addressing co-morbidities, and ensuring a secure supply of ART for
PLHIV during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (1). As of
July 10th, 2020, 12,102,328 COVID-19 patients and 551,046 COVID-10-related deaths have
been reported worldwide (2). The World Health Organization (WHO) and Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) have issued health alerts and prevention guidelines for people at
increased risk for severe health outcomes and death due to COVID-19 (3, 4). These guidelines
are generally based on the outcomes and characteristics of patients affected early in the course of
the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging patterns point to elevated risk for older persons, people
living in long-term care facilities, men, and racial/ethnic minorities who have long experienced
disparities in health outcomes for many chronic diseases (5). Chronic disease co-morbidities,
especially multimorbidity, appear to be driving factors for COVID-19 mortality. Warnings to
take extra precautions include persons with asthma, chronic lung disease, diabetes, serious
cardiovascular conditions, chronic kidney disease, obesity, chronic liver disease, and persons
who are immunocompromised such as people living with HIV (PLHIV) (3-5).
The concern over increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease for PLHIV may be based
on the assumption that PLHIV are more likely to be immunosuppressed. HIV infection is
associated with abnormal humoral and T-cell–mediated immune responses, resulting in increased
susceptibility to numerous opportunistic infections (6). Under this rationale, particular caution is
warranted for PLHIV with low CD4 cell count, advanced disease, high viral load, and those not
taking antiretroviral treatment (ART). As PLHIV are living longer with ART, many will also
have the known chronic conditions (7) associated with severe COVID-19 disease. However,
there have not been large observational studies specifically measuring symptoms, disease
severity, complications, multimorbidity, and proportion of death in confirmed COVID-19-HIV
co-infected patients. It is also not known if people with HIV who are clinically and virologically
stable will experience any greater risk for COVID-19 complications than the population without
HIV infection. At present, the available data mainly appear in case reports and case series of
COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients.
Given the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapidly changing information
about the disease, a high degree of vigilance is needed on the course of infection among PLHIV.
As there are 37.9 million PLHIV and 1.7 million new infections each year (8), patients of
COVID-19-HIV co-infection are likely to increase. This systematic review was therefore

undertaken to bring together the existing evidence on the earliest known case reports to provide a
baseline for what is known and to alert providers around the world of any emerging patterns.

Methods
Details of inclusion criteria and our analytical approach were conceptualized a priori and are
documented in Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zj2hu/).

Literature search
Following the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (see supplementary
file S1) and the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (9) guideline (10, 11), we searched
PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, preprint databases (medRxiv, bioRxiv, Preprints),
the references of publications found, and the “cited by” feature of Google Scholar from
December 1, 2019 to June 1, 2020 for studies published in English. Search terms were combined
using appropriate Boolean operators and included subject heading terms/keywords relevant to
COVID-19 (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus Disease 2019 OR COVID-19 OR severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 OR coronavirus infection) and HIV (e.g., HIV OR human
immunodeficiency virus OR AIDS OR Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). Please see
supplementary file S2 for a sample search strategy.

Inclusion criteria and study selection
Empirical studies including any study design (i.e., case report, case series, cross-sectional, casecontrol, cohort, and clinical trial) that reported individual- or aggregate- level data on COVID-19
among PLHIV were considered for this review. Studies that included a mixed sample of HIVpositive and HIV-negative COVID-19 patients were only considered if subgroup analyses for
PLHIV were reported or could be extracted. Studies were excluded if they did not present
original empirical data (e.g., editorials, commentaries, letters to editors, and reviews) or did not
report any clinical data on patients with HIV and COVID-19 co-infection. The title, abstract, and
full-text screening were completed in duplicate and independently by two reviewers. Duplicate
records were excluded and disagreements over the inclusion of studies for data extraction were
resolved through discussion or feedback from the senior author.

Data extraction
Data extraction was completed in duplicate and discrepancies were resolved through discussion
or feedback from the senior author. Data extracted included publication date, study type,
location, sample size, participants’ age and sex, as well as HIV-related data such as CD4 count
(cells/mm3), viral load (copies/ml), and antiretroviral therapy before COVID-19 diagnosis.
COVID-19 related data including clinical symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, myalgia, dyspnea,
headache, sore throat, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms). Comorbidities other than HIV
included atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease,
cerebrovascular accident, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary embolism, obesity, and
smoking. Severity of COVID-19 disease was classified as mild (i.e., non-pneumonia and mild
pneumonia), severe (i.e., dyspnea, respiratory frequency
saturation

30/min, blood oxygen

93%, and/or lung infiltrates > 50% within 24–48 h), and critical (i.e.,

respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure) (12). Admission to
the intensive care unit (ICU) and recovery status (cured, died, still in hospital) were also
collected.

Quality assessment
The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools were used to assess the methodological
quality of the included papers (13). Selected studies were examined for inclusion criteria, sample
size, description of study participants, setting, and the appropriateness of the statistical analysis.
Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers and disagreements were
resolved through discussion. The tool was modified to provide a numeric score (14, 15). Quality
assessments were done with different tools based on different study designs. Tools had nine
items for case reports, ten items for case series, nine items for cross-sectional studies, and eleven
items for cohort studies. Quality assessment tools and scores are presented in supplementary file
S3.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive analyses were used for reporting results. Continuous variables were summarized
using mean and standard deviation (SD) with differences compared using a two-tailed student’s

t-test. Categorical variables were summarized by frequency and percentage and differences were
measured using the Fisher’s exact test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant. For combining data from studies that reported aggregated data with those reported
individual data, aggregated data were weighted by the number of patients. The proportion of
death among reported patients in studies included in the review was also measured. The
denominator and nominator for this measure are based on people living with HIV whose
COVID-19 was diagnosed and reported. We also conducted a subgroup analysis by sex.

Results
The combined search strategy identified 622 potential publications on COVID-19 infection
among PLHIV (Fig 1). After screening and removing duplicate studies (n = 222) and those not
relevant to COVID-19-HIV co-infection (n = 343), the full text of 57 reports were sought to
assess for eligibility. Of these, eight did not reported information about patients with coinfection; 23 were editorials, commentaries, or reviews; and the full-text for one abstract was
unavailable. The search found 25 studies that met our inclusion criteria and were included in the
systematic review (Table 1).
Of the 25 studies on COVID-19-HIV co-infection, 19 reported information on an
individual-level, and six reported on an aggregate-level. Eleven studies were case reports (i.e.,
describing one patients), ten studies were case series including two to 33 patients. Two studies
were cross sectional investigating COVID-19 status among PLHIV. Two cohort studies were
found. Eight studies were from the US, seven from China, three from Italy, two from Spain, and
the remaining five studies were from Turkey, Germany, the UK, Republic of Cyprus, and
Uganda. Publication dates ranged from 12 March to 1 June, 2020. The Joanna Briggs Institute
critical appraisal tools assessment scores ranged from 4 to 7 for case reports (out of 8 possible
points), and 4 to 8 for the case series (out of 10 possible points), 6 to 7 for cross sectional (out of
9 possible points), and 8 to 9 for cohort studies (out of 11 possible points). As quality
assessments were done with different tools based on different study designs, scores cannot not be
directly compared.
Summed across all studies, 252 patients with COVID-19-HIV co-infection were
described with varying completeness of demographic and clinical data (Table 2). The mean age
of patients was 52.7 years. Most patients (204, 80.9%) were male; 46 (18.3%) were female, and

two (0.8%) were transgender women. Of 251 patients in studies reporting ART status, only 2.0%
were not taking ART. Low CD4 count (<200 cells/mm ) was reported for 23 of 176 patients
3

(13.1%). The viral load was high (>1000 copies per ml) for two of 233 patients (0.9%) with viral
load data. Multimorbidity included hypertension (96 of 244 patients reporting on co-morbidities,
39.3%), obesity or hyperlipidemia (as reported, 19.3%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(18.0%), and diabetes (17.2%). Smoking was reported in 53 patients (21.7%).
Table 2 also presents reported symptoms and severity of COVID-19 disease patients with
HIV infection. The most common symptoms were fever (165 of 223, 74.0%), cough (130 of 223,
58.3%), and dyspnea (68 of 223, 30.5%). Less common were headache (44 of 223, 19.7%),
arthralgia/myalgia (33 of 223, 14.8%), and sore throat (18 of 223, 8.1%). Any gastrointestinal
symptoms was reported by 13.0%. COVID-19 was reported as mild to moderate in 141 of 212
(66.5%), severe in 46 patients (21.7%), and critical in 25 patients (11.8%). The majority of
patients (158 of 244, 64.7%) were hospitalized; 16.8% were admitted to the intensive care unit.
Of all 252 reported cases of COVID-19-HIV co-infection, 36 (14.3%) were reported as
having died. Supplementary file S4 presents further information on patients where available.
Information on the sex of the deceased were available for 14 of 36 patients, with 85.7% being
male. Information on the age of the deceased was available for 21 of 36 patients, with 38.1% of
deaths occurring in patients over 65 years of age and older, 52.4% in patients age 50 to 65 years
of age, and 9.5% in patients younger than 50 years. Information about multimorbidity, was
available for 14 of 36 the deceased patients, with 64.3% reporting multimorbidity. Additional
information on ART regimen, CD4 count, viral load, and indicators of severity of disease can be
found in supplementary file S4.
Based on the available data, no significant differences between male and female patients
were observed with regards to age, clinical characteristics, severity of COVID-19, and health
outcomes of COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients (Table 3).

Discussion
In this systematic review, we summarized available data from 252 patients co-infected with
COVID-19 and HIV. The majority of patients with co-infection of HIV and COVID-19 were
male. Also in line with HIV-negative persons (16-19), data point to higher morbidity and
mortality among male patients, and higher mortality when multimorbidity is present. The main

clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in PLHIV were cough and fever, and comparable to HIVnegative people, the majority had mild COVID-19 disease (16-19).
Nonetheless, the proportion of reported PLHIV with COVID-19 appear to have higher
multimorbidity, severity of disease, and potentially higher proportion of death. Multimorbidity
was reported in nearly two-thirds of co-infected patients. The most common co-morbidities
among patients with HIV and COVID-19 were hypertension, obesity or hyperlipidemia, COPD,
and diabetes. Results of a cohort study showed that multimorbidity (mostly hypertension and
diabetes) was more prevalent in COVID-19-HIV co-infected patients than PLHIV without
COVID-19 (20). When data were available, the proportion of death among reported COVID-19HIV co-infected patients appears high (14.3%) in our pooled estimate. The result might be
confounded by other factors. For example, PLHIV may be at increased risk of mortality or
severe illness with COVID-19 based on their age and other medical conditions. Among those
who died for whom individual data were recorded, multimorbidity and older age were common.
Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and
multimorbidity not particular to HIV, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
respiratory disease, and hypertension (21). Another possible explanation is bias due to the
preponderance of publications on hospitalized patients with more severe disease.
The observational designs of the available studies and lack of appropriate control do not
permit concluding on whether ART can prevent acquisition of COVID-19 or reduce morbidity
and mortality from COVID-19. The search for anti-viral agents with activity to treat and prevent
COVID-19 is an area of active research. For example, a clinical trial in 199 patients showed that
ritonavir-boosted lopinavir did not have a benefit over standard care for COVID-19 (15). A
survey in PLHIV in China showed that nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus
non-nucleoside reverse transfer inhibitors (NNRTI) did not prevent COVID-19 infection (16). A
cohort study showed that there are no differences in previous use of NNRTI, INSTI, or protease
inhibitors in individuals with and without COVID-19 diagnosis (17). Findings of lower
morbidity or mortality among persons on ART compared to those not on ART would also need
to consider higher CD4 count and better immune status.
We acknowledge additional limitations of our study. First, while a large proportion of
COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, all of the patients in this review
were symptomatic, and most were admitted to a hospital. This study therefore refers only to
8

patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and may over-represent those with severe
COVID-19 disease. Second, the lack of appropriate comparison groups, particularly for the case
reports and case series, is a limitation to identifying factors associated with COVID-19-HIV coinfection. Third, many of the studies included in our review had small sample size. Fourth,
without a population- or probability- based survey of PLHIV, the true prevalence of COVID-19
and disease manifestations among PLHIV remain unknown. To the best of our knowledge, no
study has yet measured COVID-19-HIV co-infection in a wider or representative cross-section of
the population. Fifth, since most of the patients included in the studies reviewed were
immunologically and virologically stable, we could not conduct subgroup analyses based on low
CD4 cell count or high viral load to directly measure the association of HIV-related
immunosuppression and severity of COVID-19 disease. Such subgroup analyses should be
investigated in future studies. Finally, in the context of urgent care for large numbers of patients,
HIV may not be divulged, asked for, or recorded and therefore under-assessed among COVID19 patients.

Conclusions
The data available to date indicate that PLHIV can be infected with COVID-19 and are largely
affected by similar features of disease risk and progression as HIV-uninfected patients. The
presence of multimorbidity and older age appear to be the important factors for severe morbidity
and mortality with COVID-19-HIV co-infection. Results suggest that healthcare providers need
to address multimorbidity among PLHIV, ensure their ART supply is secure, and continue to
consider PLHIV as a population for whom precautions are needed to prevent the COVID-19.
Given the number of PLHIV worldwide, there are likely many more patients with COVID-19HIV co-infection than suggested by the scant literature to date. Clinicians and researchers could
help fill the data gap by being vigilant to patients who may be co-infected with SARS-CoV-2
and HIV.
