Strengths of this study

Large number of different European populations studied with different policies of food fortification and
different population Vitamin D levels
Ten months of longitudinal study during rise and fall and rise again of the epidemic
Limitations of this study

Based on population Vitamin D levels published before the beginning of the pandemic. Though there
hasn’t been a pan-European national/international health education initiative about Vitamin D and
COVID-19 infection, it has been well covered in the media and could have resulted in changes, though
probably minor, at the national level. Because there have been many differences in response to the
pandemic in these countries, there could be other factors involved as well

ABSTRACT

Reports early in the epidemic linking low mean national Vitamin D level with increased
COVID-19 death, and until recently little research on the impact of Vitamin D deficiency on severity of
COVID-19, led to this update of the initial report studying mortality up to the end of January 2021.
Objectives:

Coronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded
from Our World in Data, which was last updated on January 24, 2021. Data from March 21, 2020 to
January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean data were collected
by literature review. Poisson mixed-effect model was used to model the data.
Methods, Design and Setting:

European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean less than or equal to 50 have higher COVID19 death rates as compared with European countries with Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean greater than 50,
relative risk of 2.155 (95% CI: 1.068 – 4.347, p-value = 0.032). A statistically significant negative
moderate Spearman rank correlation was observed between Vitamin-D (25)-HD mean and the number
of COVID-19 deaths for each 14-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic time period.
Results:

: The observation of the significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates in countries with
lowest annual sun exposure but highest mean Vitamin-D (25)-HD levels provides support for more
awareness and possible use of food fortification. The need to consider re-configuring vaccine strategy
due to emergence of large number of COVID-19 variants and studies identifying poor responders to
Vaccine provides an opportunity to undertake therapeutic randomized control trials to confirm these
observations.

INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a major global health problem because of its high number of
patients requiring intensive care and death rate particularly in patients over 65-70 yrs of age. (1-3) The
impact has been unequal globally, primarily due to the younger populations in, for example, Africa
where the majority of the population are under 65 (4) not getting ill, except for South Africa (5) . Nonpharmaceutical interventions used to control transmission, particularly universal lockdowns, have been
the primary means of reducing case incidence and this has caused serious economic harm in many
countries (6-8).
Vitamin-D has a potential role in infections, which is implied from its effect on the innate and adaptive
immune responses (9) and the fact that respiratory infections tend to disappear during summer.
Furthermore, there is existing evidence for an association between vitamin-D deficiency and a risk of
influenza infection and when the individuals have Vitamin D deficiency, they have reduced respiratory
infection when entered into supplementation randomized trials (10, 11), though dose and scheduling is
far from clear.
In the 12 months since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, no major trials of Vitamin D have been
completed. There has however been increasing interest with 5 reports demonstrating a strong impact
of Vitamin D deficiency on the behavior of COVID-19 illness (12-16) and limited data from three small
randomized trial reporting improved clinical outcome in patients receiving replacement therapy (17).
This has been followed by posting on-line of a 930 cluster randomized trial with Calcifediol reporting a
64% reduction in deaths which has generated considerable criticism for methodology and is currently
being further revision (18) .
Population-based mean levels of vitamin-D were shown in an analysis during the first 2 months of the
pandemic to correlate inversely with COVID-19 mortality (19). The aim of this paper is to update these
analyses after 11 months of the pandemic through statistical analysis focusing on the association
between vitamin D (25)-HD average and COVID-19 mortality rates based on public record of the number
of COVID-19 deaths in 2 week periods from 21/02/2020 – 22/01/2021 in 19 European countries.

METHODS

STUDY DESIGN

Coronavirus pandemic data for 19 European countries were downloaded from “Our World in Data” (see
https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) , which was last updated on January 24, 2021 (20). Data from
March 21, 2020 to January 22, 2021 were included in the statistical analysis. Data on vitamin D
deficiency were collected via a literature review (19, 21, 22).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Last observation carried forward was used to impute missing values, whenever data were not available
(23). The vitamin D mean value (19) was missing for Greece which was (single) imputed by the median
vitamin D value of all countries.
The crude mortality rate (CMR) was computed using data from January 22, 2021 by dividing the total
number of COVID-19 deaths by the corresponding population per 100,000. Spearman rank correlation
was estimated between vitamin D averages variable and the number of COVID-19 total deaths and the
crude mortality rate respectively. A jackknife empirical 95% confidence interval for Spearman's
correlation was computed (24).
Then the vitamin D values were binarised into 0 (vitamin D ≤ 50) versus 1 (vitamin D > 50). Wilcoxon
rank-sum test was used to compare the total number of COVID-19 deaths and CMR between countries
who have vitamin D averages of less than or equals to 50 versus countries that have vitamin D averages
greater than 50 respectively.
Univariate and bivariate generalised linear regression models with Quasi-Poisson distribution were
performed using the total number of COVID-19 deaths by January 22nd 2021 as an outcome. The
predictors were the categorical vitamin D variable and the proportion of age 70+ for each country. The
population variable was added as an offset in the model. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) were computed with corresponding z- and p-values.
A time-point variable of 22 time-periods of 14 days was created between 01/03/2020 and 22/01/2021
at each time-point. A Spearman rank correlation was used to evaluate the association between the

number of COVID-19 deaths at each time-point and the average of vitamin D of the 19 European
countries. To compute an approximate 95% confidence interval (using the normality approximation) for
the estimated Spearman rank correlation, a leave-one-time-period-out cross-validation was performed
at each time-point.
A Poisson mixed effects regression model (25) was fitted with the total number of new COVID-19 deaths
as an outcome. The percentage of age 70+ and binarized vitamin D were used as fixed effect predictors.
The time-periods and the 19 European countries variable were used as random effect variables with
(04/04/2020 to 17/04/2020) and the UK as reference groups respectively. The populations variable was
added as an offset in the model. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
computed with corresponding z- and p-values.
All applied statistical tests were two-sided, p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0.2 (26)(25)(25)(25).

RESULTS

The data used in this statistical analysis are shown in Table 1 in descending order of the countries level
of Vitamin D level. It can be seen visually that the crude mortality rate (CMR) increases with decreasing
mean Vitamin D level. A statistically significant moderate negative Spearman’s ρ correlation was
observed between the total number of COVID-19 deaths and the average of vitamin D, ρ = -0.516 (95%
CI: -0.860 – -0.168) as well as between COVID-19 crude mortality rates and the average of vitamin D, ρ =
-0.430 (95% CI: -0.805 – -0.081) (Figure 1). A similar result was seen in the numbers of Table 2. This
shows the Spearman’s rho correlation analysis between the number of new COVID-19 deaths at each of
the 22 time periods and the same reported mean vitamin D used on each occasion. All the observed
negative Spearman’s rho correlation values were statistically significant.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the total number of COVID-19 deaths and CMR within the vitamin D
group (≤50 versus >50) respectively. A statistically significant difference was observed between the
vitamin D groups (≤50 versus >50), Wilcoxon sum-rank test p-value of 0.036 and 0.012 respectively.
Table 3 shows the results of the univariate and bivariate generalised linear regression model with family
quasi-Poisson using the total number of COVID-19 deaths from 22/03/2020 as an outcome. The
countries with vitamin D average ≤ 50 have higher COVID-19 death rates as compared with countries

with vitamin D average > 50, RR of 1.642 (95% CI 1.274 – 2.118, p-value = 0.02) univariately. This result
holds after adjusting for the population age structure (ie percentage of the population with age 70+), RR
of 1.663 (95% CI: 1.293 – 2.140, p-value < 0.0001). This result is similar to the result from the fitted
Poisson mixed-effects models (Table 4), where countries with vitamin D average ≤ 50 have higher
COVID-19 death rates as compared with countries with vitamin D average > 50 before and after
adjusting for population age structure with RR of 2.197 (95% CI: 1.131 – 4.271, p-value = 0.02) and 2.155
(95% CI: 1.068 – 4.347, p-value = 0.032) respectively. The percentage of age 70+ was not statistically
significant in either a univariate and bivariate regression models (Table 3 and 4).

Discussion

It is now nearly 20 years since the emergence of rickets in UK immigrant families led to introducing
supplements for pregnant women. Since this time there has been continuous conclusion, in part due to
confounding variables such as the health benefits of exercise increasing Vitamin D levels, that Vitamin D
was only important for bone and muscle health. Despite regularly assuring the UK population that the
pandemic would lessen during our summer months, there has been no funding for clinical trials of
Vitamin D supplements and negative reviews mainly based on others data by PHE, SACN, NICE
(https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng187). This negative view focuses attention onto an on-going
controversy dating back to the 1950s, i.e. whether food should be supplemented with Vitamin D. In the
early years after the 2nd world war in the UK enthusiasm for supplementation was so great that children
died from overdose hypercalcaemia. As a result, the UK has been more reluctant to sanction such
supplementation while it has been used increasingly used in the Scandinavian countries (27). This could
explain why most of these countries, despite having less sunshine than the UK, have lower RRs. The one
exception is Sweden which had a policy of attempting to generate hard immunity . The increasing data
to support this interpretation started with Meltzer et al studying Vitamin D levels in 489 attendees in an
urban medical centre in Chicago (13). They demonstrated a higher frequency of acquisition of COVID-19
cases in the Vitamin D deficient group (21.9%) than in the sufficient group (12.2%). This was
subsequently confirmed by a much larger study (14) and two smaller studies (12, 15). The Boston group
also reported data suggesting a link between Vitamin D deficiency and increased severity of disease (16).
In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, Pereira et al (28) show, that vitamin D insufficiency
increased COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.06–2.58).

Using UK Biobank data of 502,624 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010, Hastie et al
(29, 30) show that COVID-19 participants who had COVID-19 have lower vitamin-D level with median of
43.8 (IQR: 28.7-61.6) as compared with those who had no COVID-19 median of 47.2 (IQR: 32.7–62.7),
Wilcoxon’s p-value < 0.01. However, this result was not statistically significant after adjustment for
confounders, though this did not make allowance for the fact that some of the confounders were also
associated with Vitamin D deficiency.
In a cohort of 185 patients at the Medical University Hospital Heidelberg-Germany, vitamin-D deficiency
was associated with higher risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and deaths after adjusting for age,
gender, and comorbidities, HR of 6.12 (95% CI: 2.79–13.42, p < 0.001) and 14.73 (95% CI 4.16–52.19, p <
0.001) (31, 32).
Karahan and Katkat (33) show that vitamin-D insufficiency was present in 93.1% of the patients with
severe-critical COVID-19, and that vitamin-D 25(OH) mean was significantly lower in patients with
severe-critical COVID-19 compared with moderate COVID-19.
Despite all of these strong indications that Vitamin D could play an important role in the control of the
COVID-19 pandemic, formally published papers have less than 500 patients recruited to randomized
trials of Vitamin D(28). There has been one prospective observational study on 410 patients from India
which at first sight was considered as a failure of Vitamin D supplementation
(https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-129238/v1, currently undergoing major revision). As it
gave Vitamin D to two thirds of those with Vitamin D deficiency who were also younger than those who
weren’t, the inverse of what is expected from other studies was seen. Overall there was a very low
mortality rate and there was no difference in survival between those with and those without Vitamin D
deficiency .

No data has been published from the UK about the effect of Vitamin D replacement. This is despite a
continuous debate since April 2020 about Vitamin D deficiency contributing to excess deaths in the
BAME community (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-understanding-the-impacton-bame-communities). Throughout the year, the BAME community are known to have 20% less
circulating vitamin D (34) and even in summer more than 30% have severe deficiency compared to less
than 6% in white European population (35) and probably have done so for many of the years since birth.

In addition, there are two studies, one a randomized trial, that have clearly demonstrated that such
individuals need 10 times more Vitamin D than recommended in the SACN report (36, 37).
Clearly, accelerating the role out of Vaccines around the world should not diminish. However as our data
could not adjust for well established COVID-19 confounders such as Diabetes, Obesity, social deprivation
and poverty, the increasing availability of simple finger-prick techniques (www.vitamindtest.org.uk) that
speed up measuring of Vitamin D should make better selection for such therapy trials easier to recruit.
Given reports published on line but still under review (see https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperialcollege/institute-of-global-health-innovation/REACT-2-round-5-preprint.pdf table 4) that the over 70’s
population have a 62% failure rate to produce IgG antibodies >21 days after first vaccination compared
to 24% in 50-69 year olds and 7% in <50 year olds and the older age groups have a well recognized risk
of lower Vitamin D levels, there could be a strong case to evaluate Vitamin D supplements in such
patients.
The need to investigate Vitamin D deficiency as a cause of poor response to vaccine is further supported
by 2 reports in patients known to have a high degree of Vitamin D deficiency. These are both currently
under review and report diminished antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination. The first was in obese
subjects (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.24.21251664v1 ) and the second was in
patients with cancer (https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/delaying-second-vaccine-dose-cancer-patientsvulnerable-virus )
Conclusion
The data from this statistical analysis shows a strong and statistically significant association between the
Vitamin D deficiency and the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the 19 European countries included in
this statistical analysis. The new vitamin D techniques for easier detection of deficiency using the finger
prick technology should enable better selection of patients to benefit from treatment and prove it with
appropriately selected COVID-19 patients in treatment trials and in trials aiming to reduce poor immune
response in vaccine recipients.
