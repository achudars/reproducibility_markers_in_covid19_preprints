Abstract: n=50; Word limit = 50

22

We analyzed the epidemic doubling time of the 2019-nCoV outbreak by province in mainland China.

23

Mean doubling time ranged from 1.0 to 3.3 days, being 2.4 days for Hubei (January 20-February 2, 2020).

24

Trajectory of increasing doubling time by province indicated social distancing measures slowed the

25

epidemic with some success.

To the editor:

28

Our ability to estimate basic reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is hindered by

29

the dearth of information about their epidemiological characteristics and transmission mechanisms (1).

30

More informative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the extent to which the epidemic

31

is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they rely on minimal data of the

32

outbreak’s trajectory (2).

33

Epidemic doubling times characterize the sequence of times at which the cumulative incidence

34

doubled (3). Here we analyze the evolution of the doubling times and the number of times the cumulative

35

incidence doubles, associated with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak by province in mainland

36

China (4), from January 20 (when provinces outside Hubei started reporting cases) through February 2,

37

2020. See Technical Appendix for a sensitivity analysis applied to data from December 31, 2019 through

38

February 2, 2020. If an epidemic is growing exponentially with a constant growth rate r, the doubling

39

time should remain constant, where doubling time = (ln 2) / r. An increase in doubling time could mean

40

the epidemic has slowed down, assuming that the underlying reporting rate remained unchanged (see

41

Technical Appendix and Figure S1).

42

Cumulative incidence data from December 31, 2019 through February 2, 2020 were retrieved

43

from official webpages of provincial health commissions, and that of the National Health Commission of

44

China (5). They were double-checked against the reported numbers of the provinces according to Centre

45

for Health Protection, Hong Kong, if available (6). Whenever discrepancies arose, the respective

46

provincial government sources were deemed authoritative. Tibet was excluded from further analysis

47

because there was only one case as of February 2, 2020 and thus doubling time could not be calculated.

48

All data analyzed are publicly available.

49

From January 20 through February 2, 2020, the mean doubling time of the cumulative incidence

50

ranged from 1.0 day (Hunan and Henan) to 3.3 days (Hainan) (Figure 1A). In Hubei, it was estimated as

51

2.4 days. The cumulative incidence of Hubei doubled 5 times (Figure 1B). Provinces with the cumulative

52

incidence doubled ≥5 times, and mean doubling time <2d included Chongqing, Fujian, Heilongjiang,

53

Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, Shanghai, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. These provinces

54

experienced a faster and consistent epidemic growth (Figures 1 and S2).

55

The aggregate cumulative incidence of all non-Hubei provinces increased over time (Figure S3)

56

and therefore suggested a sub-exponential growth of the epidemic outside Hubei. The gradual piece-meal

57

increase in doubling time could be explained by the practice of self-quarantine since the Chinese New

58

Year and the different levels of intra-and-inter-provincial travel restrictions imposed across China since

59

the travel quarantine of Wuhan (imposed on Jan 23, 2020) (7).

60

The limitations of our study included the incompleteness of the cumulative incidence data as

61

reported by mainland Chinese authorities. One potential reason for underreporting is underdiagnosis, due

62

to the lack of diagnostic tests, healthcare workers and other resources. Differential underreporting across

63

provinces could have biased the data. However, as long as the rate of reporting remains constant over

64

time within the same province, the calculation of doubling times remains reliable. However, increased

65

awareness and increased availability of diagnostic tests might have improved the reporting rate over time.

66

This might artificially shorten the doubling time. Nevertheless, apart for Hubei, for the majority of

67

mainland China, cases were only reported since January 20, 2020. It was when the Chinese authorities

68

openly acknowledged the seriousness of the outbreak. Therefore, the bias due to increased awareness

69

might be small to negligible.

70

Conclusions

71

We analyzed the epidemic doubling time of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak by province in mainland

72

China. The mean doubling time of cumulative incidence in Hubei was 2.4 days (January 20 through

73

February 2, 2020) but the mean doubling time of Henan, Hunan, and Shandong were the lowest.

Technical appendix
Additional information on our motivation, scope and methods
Motivation. R0 is a widely used indicator of transmission potential in a totally susceptible population and
is driven by the average contact rate and the mean infectious period of the disease (1). Yet, it only
characterizes transmission potential at the onset of the epidemic and varies geographically for a given
infectious disease according to local healthcare provision, outbreak response, as well as socioeconomic
and cultural factors. Furthermore, estimating R0 requires information about the natural history of the
infectious disease. Thus, our ability to estimate reproduction numbers for novel infectious diseases is
hindered by the dearth of information about their epidemiological characteristics and transmission
mechanisms. More informative metrics could synthesize real-time information about the extent to which
the epidemic is expanding over time. Such metrics would be particularly useful if they rely on minimal
data of the outbreak’s trajectory.
Scope and definition. We restricted our analysis to mainland China in this paper. A ‘province’ herein
encompasses three different types of political sub-divisions of mainland China, namely, a province, a
directly administered municipality (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin) and an autonomous
region (Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, and Xinjiang). Our analysis does not include Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and Macau Special Administrative Region, which are under
effective rule of the People’s Republic of China through the so-called ‘One Country, Two Systems’
political arrangements. Likewise, our analysis does not include Taiwan, which is de facto governed by a
different government (the Republic of China).
Data apart from epidemic data. Provincial demographic, transportation and socioeconomic data were
obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2) and other sources (see Table S2).
Doubling time calculation. As the epidemic grows, the times at which cumulative incidence doubles are
given by t di such that 2C(t di ) = C(tdi+1 ) where t do = 0 , C(t do ) = C0 , and i = 0,1,2,3, …, nd where nd is

the total number of times cumulative incidence doubles (Figure S1). The actual sequence of “doubling
times” are defined as follows (Figure S1):

d j = Dt d j = t d j - t d j-1 where j = 1,2,3, …, nd.
Doubling time calculation was conducted using MATLAB R2019b (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Multiple
linear regression analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.2 (R Core Team). Significance level was a
priori decided to be α = 0.05.
Additional information on our results and discussion
Demographic, transportation and socioeconomic factors. We performed multiple linear regression
models with the latest doubling time, mean doubling time and the slope of the doubling time over the
number of times the cumulative incidence doubles as the dependent variables, respectively. We included
population density, average temperature in January, average household size, subnational Human
Development Index in all models. We included passenger traffic and provincial capital’s distance from
Wuhan, for railway (models group A) and highway (models group B) respectively. However, none of the
independent variables were found statistically significantly (p > 0.05) associated with any of the
dependent variables (Table S2).
Sensitivity analysis
We performed sensitivity analysis by expanding our data analysis to the data since January 31, 2019,
when Hubei first reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unexplained etiology that turned out to be
2019-nCoV. The only difference between the sensitivity analysis and the main analysis is the inclusion of
Hubei data from January 31, 2019 through January 19, 2020, because all other provinces started to report
cases on January 20, 2020. The only differences in results were found for Hubei, with the mean doubling
time being 3.85 (Figures S4, S6), and the cumulative incidence in Hubei doubled 8 times from January
31, 2019 through February 2, 2020 (Figures S5, S6). The first doubling time of Hubei (Figure S5) was

high, reflecting that real-time data was unavailable before mid-January. It was only by January 17, 2020
onwards when data reporting become increasingly transparent and timely.
In our sensitivity analysis, we performed the same multiple regression models previously described, with
the mean doubling time, and the slope of the doubling time over the number of times the cumulative
incidence doubles as dependent variables. We included population density, average temperature in
January, average household size, subnational Human Development Index in all models. We included
passenger traffic and provincial capital’s distance from Wuhan, for railway and highway respectively.
However, none of the independent variables were found statistically significantly (p > 0.05) associated
with the three dependent variables (results not shown).
