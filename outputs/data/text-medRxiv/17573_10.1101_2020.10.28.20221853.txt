Summary

31

Background. Real-time genomic sequencing has played a major role in tracking the global

32

spread and local transmission of SARS-CoV-2, contributing greatly to disease mitigation

33

strategies. After effectively eliminating the virus, New Zealand experienced a second outbreak of

34

SARS-CoV-2 in August 2020. During this August outbreak, New Zealand utilised genomic

35

sequencing in a primary role to support its track and trace efforts for the first time, leading to a

36

second successful elimination of the virus.

37

Methods. We generated the genomes of 80% of the laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-

38

CoV-2 from New Zealand’s August 2020 outbreak and compared these genomes to the available

39

global genomic data.

40

Findings. Genomic sequencing was able to rapidly identify that the new COVID-19 cases in New

41

Zealand belonged to a single cluster and hence resulted from a single introduction. However,

42

successful identification of the origin of this outbreak was impeded by substantial biases and

43

gaps in global sequencing data.

44

Interpretation. Access to a broader and more heterogenous sample of global genomic data

45

would strengthen efforts to locate the source of any new outbreaks.

46

Funding. This work was funded by the Ministry of Health of New Zealand, New Zealand Ministry

47

of Business, Innovation and Employment COVID-19 Innovation Acceleration Fund (CIAF-0470),

48

ESR Strategic Innovation Fund and the New Zealand Health Research Council (20/1018 and

49

20/1041).

Main Text

52

Only twelve days after the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified, a genome of the virus

53

was first published1. This information was pivotal to the subsequent, rapid, development of

54

diagnostic tests and identification of potential treatments2,3. Since then, as of 25 September 2020,

55

over 110,000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 have been shared publicly4. The underlying genome

56

sequencing has occurred so quickly that, for the first time during an infectious disease outbreak,

57

it has enabled virological and epidemiological data to be integrated in real time5. Analysis of these

58

data has played an important role in informing the COVID-19 response by tracking the global

59

spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, including identification of the number, source, and timing

60

of introductions into individual countries. This has led to a greater understanding of COVID-19

61

outbreaks around the world6-13.

62

Of the 185 countries that have reported positive cases of COVID-19 to the World Health

63

Organization14, 60% (n=112) have sequenced and shared SARS-CoV-2 genomes on the GISAID

64

database4 (September 2020). This immense global sequencing effort has facilitated ongoing

65

genomic surveillance of the pandemic, including monitoring viral genetic changes of interest12,

66

which has informed public health responses15-18. Nevertheless, the number and proportion of

67

positive cases sequenced, and genomes published, varies dramatically between countries and

68

over time (Figure 1). The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, for example, has led to

69

the UK being the most represented sampling location, totalling over 42,000 genomes and

70

comprising 39% of the global data set despite recording only 1% of the world’s positive cases (n

71

= 412,241). Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in India represent just 3% of the

72

global data set but 18% of the world’s total reported cases (n = 5,646,010).

73

We show here that such disparities in sequencing effort can have major implications for data

74

interpretation and must be met with careful consideration. Real-time sequencing of SARS-CoV-2

75

genomes has, however, had particular utility in tracking the re-emergence of the virus in New

76

Zealand. By June 2020 New Zealand had effectively eliminated COVID-19 in the community and

77

positive cases were limited to those linked to managed quarantine facilities at the border7,13,19.

78

Following over 100 days with no detected community transmission of COVID-19, four new cases

79

emerged on August 12, 2020 with no apparent epidemiological link to any known case. We

80

compared the genomes of these cases to sequenced cases from both New Zealand’s first wave

81

and those in quarantine facilities and, again, found no link. The vast majority of available

82

sequence data from cases in New Zealand’s quarantine facilities were of different virus lineages

83

than that of the August 2020 outbreak. However, this observation was of limited value given that

84

only 42% of cases in those quarantine facilities had adequate viral RNA for successful genomic

85

sequencing. In order to determine the likely origins of this outbreak we compared genomes from

86

the new community outbreak to the global data set.

87

An initial genomic sequence analysis found that the re-emergence of COVID-19 in New Zealand

88

was due to a SARS-CoV-2 from lineage B.1.1.120. Of the countries that have contributed SARS-

89

CoV-2 data, 40% had genomes of this lineage. Remarkably, 85% of B.1.1.1. genomes were from

90

the UK and were generated between March – September 2020, the vast majority of which were

91

sampled during the first wave of disease in the UK (Figure 2). Phylogenetic analysis of the most

92

recently sampled B.1.1.1. genomes (1,996 of 4,544) identified genomes sampled from

93

Switzerland, South Africa and England in August as the most likely to be contained within the

94

sister clade (Figure 2): these were the closest sampled genomic relatives of the viruses associated

95

with New Zealand’s August 2020 outbreak (Supplementary Figure 1). Additional Bayesian analysis

96

estimated that the outbreak originated 11 days before the first transmission event, with a 95%

97

highest posterior density (HPD) of 0 – 28 days. We also estimated that the first transmission event

98

in the outbreak occurred between 26 July – 13 August 2020 (95% HPD; mean date of 5 August).

99

Epidemiological data showed that two confirmed cases linked to the outbreak had a symptom

100

onset date of 31 July, although the most probable sampled genomes within the sister clade were

101

sampled later, between 6 August – 28 August. Hence, is unlikely that the currently available global

102

genomic data set contains the source of this outbreak.

103

Genomic epidemiological analysis on the possible origins of New Zealand’s re-emergence was

104

found to be inconclusive, likely due to missing genomic data within the quarantine border facilities

105

as well as in the global data set. A glimpse into the genomic diversity likely omitted from the

106

global data set can be seen in the genomes sequenced in New Zealand from positive quarantine

107

cases which comprise citizens and residents returning from across the globe . For example, 12

108

SARS-CoV-2 genomes from returnees to New Zealand from India who arrived on the same flight

109

fell across at least four genomic lineages and comprised sequence divergence of up to 34 single

110

nucleotide polymorphisms. This represented far more genomic mutations than was observed in

111

New Zealand during the first outbreak in March – May 2020. Such a high level of diversity in just a

112

small sample of positive cases from India suggest that the currently available genomic data fails

113

to encompass the true diversity that existed locally let alone globally.

114

The re-emergence of COVID-19 into New Zealand in August 2020 exemplified one of the most

115

complete genomic data sets for a specific outbreak compiled to date, comprising 81% of positive

116

cases (145 of 179 total PCR positive cases). Real-time genomic sequencing quickly informed

117

track and trace efforts to control the outbreak, setting New Zealand on track to eliminate the virus

118

from the community for the second time. The rapid genome sequencing of positive samples

119

provided confidence to public health teams regarding links to the outbreak and identified that

120

cases and sub-clusters were linked to a single genomic lineage, resulting from a single

121

introduction event. Indeed, the timing and length of lockdown measures were partly informed

122

based on these data.

123

Nevertheless, the biased nature of global sampling, including the contribution of very few genome

124

sequences from certain geographic locations, clearly limited the power of genomics to attribute

125

the geographical origin of New Zealand’s August 2020 outbreak. We therefore advocate that

126

careful consideration of the potential sampling biases and gaps in available genomic data be

127

made whenever attempting to determine the geographic origins of a specific outbreak of SARS-

128

CoV-2. Analysis should consider all available evidence, including from genomic and

129

epidemiological sources.

Methods

143

Ethics statement. Nasopharyngeal samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time

144

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were obtained from public health medical diagnostics

145

laboratories located throughout New Zealand. All samples were de-identified before receipt by the

146

researchers. Under contract for the New Zealand Ministry of Health, ESR has approval to conduct

147

genomic sequencing for surveillance of notifiable diseases.

148

Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2: New Zealand’s second wave. A total of 172 (out of 179)

149

laboratory-confirmed samples of SARS-CoV-2 were received by ESR for whole genome

150

sequencing, comprising samples from New Zealand’s August 2020 outbreak. Genome

151

sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples was performed as before7. In short, viral extracts were

152

prepared from respiratory tract samples where SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR using

153

WHO recommended primers and probes targeting the E and N gene. Extracted RNA from SARS-

154

CoV-2 positive samples were subject to whole genome sequencing following the ARTIC network

155

protocol (V3) (https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-sequencing-protocol-v3-locost-bh42j8ye)

156

and the Massey University 1200 bp primer set (https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019-

157

sequencing-protocol-rapid-barcoding-1200-bh7hj9j6)21.

158

Briefly, one of the tiling amplicon designs were used to amplify viral cDNA prepared with

159

SuperScript IV. Sequence libraries were then constructed, using the Oxford Nanopore ligation

160

sequencing and native barcoding expansion kit for samples amplified with the ARTIC V3 primer

161

sets, and the Oxford Nanopore rapid barcoding kit for samples amplified with the 1200 bp primer

162

sets. The 1200 bp primers and rapid barcoding was used in cases where the genomes were

163

required urgently. Libraries were sequenced using R9.4.1 MinION flow cells, respectively. Near-

164

complete (>90% recovered) viral genomes were subsequently assembled through reference

165

mapping. Steps included in the pipeline are described in detail online (https://github.com/ESR-

166

NZ/NZ_SARS-CoV-2_genomics ). The reads generated with Nanopore sequencing using ARTIC

167

primer sets (V3) were mapped and assembled using the ARTIC bioinformatics medaka pipeline (v

168

1.1.0). In total, 145 (out of 172) genomes from New Zealand’s August 2020 outbreak passed

169

quality control. All data are available on GISAID.

170

Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2. All human SARS-CoV-2 genomes available on GISAID4

171

as of 25 September 2020 (n = 109,379) were downloaded and their lineages assigned according

172

to the proposed nomenclature16 using pangolin (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin).

173

Genomes assigned to the B.1.1.1. lineage (n = 4,544) were subsampled to include 1,996 most

174

recent-in-time sequences along with four outgroup (non-B.1.1.1.) sequences, and were aligned

175

with those from the recent New Zealand outbreak (n = 140) using MAFFT (v 7)22 employing the

176

FFT-NS-2 progressive alignment algorithm. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed
