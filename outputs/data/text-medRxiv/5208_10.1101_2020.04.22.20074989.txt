Abstract:

8

A number of methods for decontaminating disposable filtering face piece respirators have been

9

explored for use in health care settings during epidemics where respirators are in short supply, such as

10

the current Covid-19 pandemic. Heating to temperatures above 65¬∞C has been shown to successfully

11

inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on various surfaces. Ovens or similar heating devices are likely

12

already widely available in hospitals globally. We did a quantitative fit test on nine models of FFP2

13

and FFP3 respirators before and after heat treatment in an oven. These included both flat fold and

14

moulded cup styles. All passed the initial fit test, and all but two passed the post-treatment fit test.

15

This study demonstrates that FFP respirators can still retain both filtration efficiency and fit after wear

16

and heat treatment, but that it is necessary to understand the probability for failure of fit after

17

decontamination. Heat shows promise as a simple and effective way of treating FFP respirators.

18

Further evaluation of longer-term wear and disinfection effectiveness of heat treatment should be

19

done before widespread use.

Introduction:

26

The current Covid-19 pandemic is not only a public health crisis but also an occupational health

27

crisis; numerous countries face shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE). In healthcare

28

settings, disposable filtering face piece (FFP) respirators that have filtration efficiencies of 95% or

29

99% (N95 in USA and FFP3 in Europe, respectively) are needed for frontline workers treating

30

patients with Covid-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the disease can be shed and

31

transmitted through the respiratory route, especially in close contact, and therefore any shortage of

32

respiratory protective equipment (RPE) is detrimental to the health of frontline workers.

33

In the past, studies have explored methods for decontaminating and reusing FFP respirators, but this

34

has not been put into common practice (Heimbuch et al., 2011; Lindsley et al., 2015; Lore et al.,

35

2012; Viscusi et al., 2009). Now, numerous initiatives (‚ÄúN95DECON - A scientific consortium for

36

data-driven study of N95 FFR decontamination,‚Äù 2020) are underway to determine the effectiveness

37

of decontamination methods in 1) disinfecting respirators and 2) maintaining both the filtration

38

efficiency and fit of the respirator. Respirators that meet filtration standards (N95 or FFP3) may still

39

not confer adequate protection due to inward leakage of a respirator poorly fitted to the wearer‚Äôs face

40

(Cherrie et al., 2018). Even fit-tested respirators may lose adequate fit after being worn, thus

41

disposable FFP respirators are normally meant for single use only. Retaining fit is as important to

42

maintaining RPE effectiveness as filtration for any decontamination method. Decontamination

43

methods that have been tested and found able to maintain FFP effectiveness without leaving a residue

44

that may be either a nuisance or hazardous to the wearer include UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI),

45

hydrogen peroxide vapour, and heat (CDC, 2020; ‚ÄúDecontamination Methods for 3M N95

46

Respirators,‚Äù 2020; Lindsley et al., 2015; Viscusi et al., 2009).

47

While effective, methods such as UVGI and hydrogen peroxide vapour may not be readily available

48

in a care facility. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been shown to be rendered inactive at temperatures of

49

70¬∞C (Chin et al., 2020). Heat is a relatively easy and accessible method of decontamination.

50

Filtration efficiency up to 110¬∞C dry heat was still retained for three unused N95 models in one

51

experiment (Viscusi et al., 2009). However there is no information on how this affects total inward

52

leakage (which accounts for both filtration and fit) may be affected by heat. We tested a small set of

53

FFP respirators donated by hospitals and various other organisations to evaluate whether heat

54

treatment would adversely affect the ability of the respirator to pass a quantitative fit test after one

55

wear and subsequent heat treatment.

56

Methods:

57

Nine different respirator models were tested (Table 1), most of which were certified as FFP3. Due to

58

the lack of availability of FFP3 masks, some of the tested masks were FFP2 versions. One of each

59

type of respirator was tested, with the exception of one model, which was tested by two different

60

wearers. Each respirator was tested once by one of four wearers using the HSE INDG 479

61

(‚ÄúGuidance on respiratory protective equipment (RPE) fit testing - INDG479,‚Äù 2019) and BSIF

62

Fit2Fit Companion Guide for Quantitative Fit Test protocol (‚ÄúFit2Fit Companion to HSE INDG479,‚Äù

63

n.d.) with a TSI PortaCount Pro+ 8038 (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN USA), with a TSI Model

64

8026 Particle Generator which generates non-toxic NaCl particles. Three of the wearers were trained

65

fit testers and male. One tester was female, and not a trained tester. The test protocol included 84

66

seconds of each of the following activities in order, conducted while walking in place: normal

67

breathing; deep breathing; turning head side-to-side; nodding head up and down; reciting the rainbow

68

passage; bending over (standing); and normal breathing. The fit factor (FF) is the ratio of ambient air

69

particle concentration to in-respirator particle concentration and is calculated as:

70

ùêπùêπ =

ùê∂ùêµ + ùê∂ùê¥
2ùê∂ùëÖ

71

Where CB = particle concentration in ambient air before respirator sample, CA = particle concentration

72

in ambient air after respirator sample, CR = particle concentration in respirator.

73

The pass level was set at FF=100 and the test was stopped once failure was detected.

74

After the first fit test, respirators were then placed in a drying oven with a target of 85 degrees for

75

approximately one hour, with a minimum of 30 minutes at the target temperature. Oven temperature

76

was set using an external calibrated temperature probe. Respirators were placed in nylon heat resistant

77

bags before placement in the oven. Two data logging temperature sensors (Hydrochron iButton¬Æ

78

DS1923; Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA, USA) were placed in the bags with the respirators to check

79

the actual temperature in the vicinity of the respirator. The total time in the oven was generally about

80

an hour due to time to equilibration for the temperature probes.

81

After removal from the oven, the respirators were allowed to cool for at least half an hour before re-

82

test by the same wearer. Treatment generally occurred several hours to about a day after the initial

83

test. Overall fit factor was compared pre- and post- treatment. It should be noted that experience with

84

fit testing has shown that a degree of test-retest variability is to be expected and that this would be

85

encompassed by the re-test results here. However, such variation would be expected to be random

86

rather than systematic.

87

Results:

88

One respirator failed the initial pre-treatment fit test and was left out of the study. Two post-treatment

89

tests were failed, while all others passed (Figure 1). With the exception of one respirator (3M 8810),

90

all passing respirators had lower overall fit factors upon post-treatment tests. The reasonable

91

consistency in the direction of change suggests this is a real effect and not an artefact created by

92

random test-retest variability.

93

During one of the heat treatments, one of the temperature loggers read a maximum temperature of

94

65¬∞ùê∂ even as the other logger in the oven at the same time, read 86¬∞C. This is likely to have affected

95

at least two respirators (Table 1).

96
97

Discussion:

98

We have examined the ability of FFP2/FFP3 respirators to pass a quantitative fit test after a single

99

wear and heat treatment. The heat treatments were all at or above temperatures shown in other studies

100

to deactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most respirators, of both flat fold and moulded cup style, were

101

able to pass a re-test.

102

In this study, because we were testing donated respirators, most of our wearers were not previously fit

103

tested for these respirators, with the exception of one. Although we did not test filtration efficiency

104

post-heat treatment, it is unlikely that this was adversely affected by the treatment, as most respirators

105

passed the second fit test. One of the respirator models that failed post-treatment fit test was duplicate

106

tested by a different wearer, who passed the post-treatment test, therefore the fit test failure was likely

107

due to alterations in fit, not filtration efficiency. In both failed fit tests post-treatment, visual

108

inspection of the respirators indicated that some physical aspect of the respirator was adversely

109

affected. For the 3M 1863 failure ‚Äì the wearer had difficulty with refitting the nose clip the second

110

time. For the Alpha Solway S-3V failure ‚Äì the foam gasket around the face seal appeared to be more

111

wrinkled and loose after the first wear. It is likely, therefore that impaired fit is responsible for both

112

these failures, rather than filtration efficiency.

113

The post-treatment fit tests tended to have a lower overall fit factor, indicating that there may be some

114

degradation, although this is not a large enough sample to determine whether this is a real effect or a

115

chance finding. Repeated treatments and fit tests on the same respirator would need to be done to

116

determine the likelihood that FFP respirators could be treated and re-used effectively multiple times.

117

Our study shows that it is possible to treat and re-use FFP respirators at least once, thus doubling the

118

potential numbers of respirator uses. This does not take into account any wear/deformation during

119

use that might impair the extent to which it can be re-used. For example, these tests were conducted

120

for a relatively short wear time, and in real use respirators may be worn for longer periods, and this

121

may also affect the reusability of the mask.

122

Finally, although we were able to show that FFP respirators can withstand heat treatment and still pass

123

a quantitative fit test, we did not test actual pathogen decontamination. Even if SARS-CoV-2 can be

124

successfully decontaminated at <70¬∞C, this does not mean that other pathogens or harmful microbes

125

are effectively deactivated. Future work should include a pathogen viability test, and a greater range

126

of temperatures. We were unable to measure humidity, and more controlled temperature/humidity

127

combinations should be tested to optimise both decontamination and preservation of respirator

128

effectiveness.

Conclusions:

130

Heat treatment at temperatures which inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not adversely affect

131

filtration or fit of most FFP2 or FFP3 respirators tested, although we acknowledge that there is still a

132

reasonable risk of fit failure. Heat could be a simple and inexpensive means to decontaminate

133

respirators, and further investigation is needed to understand the impact of repeated long wear-

134

decontamination-reuse cycles on respirator performance. Furthermore, we need to determine the

135

optimal temperature and humidity conditions for acceptable decontamination while still retaining

136

filtration and fit of the respirator. We strongly recommend that reuse of respirators, especially those

137

which require more deformation to fit the user be kept with the original individual. Users should be

138

taught how to visually inspect the respirators and how to do a seal check before re-use.
