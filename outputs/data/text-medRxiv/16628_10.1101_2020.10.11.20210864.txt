Abstract
Background
This research explored awareness, perception, and practice of COVID 19 prevention among residents of
communities in all the local government areas (districts) in Rivers State during the early stages of the
pandemic response.

Design
This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which employed an interviewer-administered four-page
questionnaire built into the Open Data Kit application for android phones. Knowledge and practice
scores were computed by scoring every correct response/action as 1 and wrong responses as 0.
Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of ≥80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of
<50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were categorized as having correct
handwashing practice.

Setting
Rivers State in the South-South region of Nigeria had recorded over 2000 cases of COVID 19 as of 18th
August 2020, ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria. As with any epidemic of an infectious
nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. Risk communication utilizes multi-faceted activities
geared towards facilitating correct and consistent knowledge and prevention practice.

Participants
Study involved 1,294 adult community residents in the 23 districts of the state.

Results
The respondents were aged between 18 and 80 years with average age of 39.6 years (SD = 11.9 years). A
total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary
education. Almost all respondents 1,271 (98.2%) had heard about COVID 19. The three most common
sources of information about COVID 19 were radio jingles 1102 (86.7%), television adverts 940 (74.0%)
and announcements in Church 612 (48.2%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had poor
knowledge of COVID 19. About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19
acknowledged that COVID 19 is a problem in the state while 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they
were unlikely contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of the respondents washed all critical parts of the
hand correctly.

Conclusions
Risk communication interventions during pandemics need to be based on an understanding of the gaps
in knowledge, attitude, perceptions, and practice. Broadcast media has a pivotal role to play in risk
communication for behaviour change for the control of current and future epidemics in this population.

Introduction
The novelle coronavirus disease (COVID 19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS – Cov 2) was first found in Wuhan, China in 2019. 1 The disease spread quickly in
epic proportions to over 26 countries within eight weeks, prompting the World Health Organization
(WHO) to declare it a pandemic on the 11th of March 2020.2 The pandemic has had its toll on virtually
every country in the world, including Nigeria, which recorded its 1st case in February 2020 and has since
gone on to record over 50 000 cases as at 18th of August 2020.3 Rivers State is in the South-South region
and a major economic city known for crude oil exploration in the country has had its share of the
pandemic, with close to over 2000 cases as at 18th of August 2020, following its index case identified on
the 25th of March 2020 ranking 5th among the high burden states in Nigeria.4
As with any epidemic of an infectious nature, panic, fear, and misconceptions are rife. This is more so
because COVID 19 does not presently have a vaccine or a specific cure.1 Coronavirus disease is known to
be highly infectious but with a low National case fatality rate of 2.1% compared to other epidemic
diseases like Ebola virus disease (42.1%) and Lassa Fever disease (20.9%) that have hit the country.5 A
similar picture of misinformation, poor knowledge on disease outbreak and negative behaviours was
observed during the Ebola epidemic of 2014, which led to a lot of harmful practices carried out by
people to remain safe.6,7 A study done in China in the early stages of the pandemic showed good
knowledge and practice of preventive measures against COVID 19 with 98% of respondents wearing a
facemask when going out. 8 However, in Nigeria, while most people identified radio as their main source
of information on COVID 19, they attributed the disease to one affecting only the affluent and could not
be bothered with the practice of preventive measures in the face of economic hardship during the
lockdown.9,10
The risk communication pillar of the public health emergency operations centre (PHEOC) is responding
to the pandemic through multi-faceted activities relating to community mobilization, mass media,

training of message multipliers, information education and communication (IEC) materials etc. These
activities are geared towards facilitating correct and consistent information from experts to
communities at risk to enable them to adopt behaviours to prevent and control COVID 19.12 The efforts
at flattening the pandemic curve in the South-South region will ultimately depend on the willingness of
people to adopt and maintain public health preventive health practices as advocated during community
engagements.
It is therefore critical that a risk assessment is carried out to explore awareness, perception, and practice
of COVID 19 prevention among residents of communities in Rivers State. This would advise risk
communication activities to facilitate desirable behaviour change for COVID 19 and address rumours
and misconceptions gotten as feedback from the survey.

Methods
This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey which took place among community residents in all 23
Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Rivers State between 18th May to 10th June 2020. Data was collected
by disease surveillance and notifications officers (DSNOs) who are familiar with the terrain and in each
LGA and are trained in data collection techniques. A sample size of 1,186 adult respondents was
calculated based on the sample size formula for single proportions where the prevalence of good
knowledge about COVID 19 was set at 50% (since there is no previously established prevalence), degree
of accuracy set at 3% and 10% non-response rate.
The data collection tool was an interviewer-administered four-page questionnaire built into the Open
Data Kit application for android phones with GPS tracking. A training was done for the DSNOs on the
objectives and tools for the study. Data was exported to Microsoft Excel and analysed with SPSS version
23.
Major outcome variables studied were knowledge of COVID 19, attitude towards COVID 19 and practice
of COVID 19 prevention methods. Knowledge score was computed by scoring every correct answer to
the knowledge questions as 1 and wrong answers as 0. The total knowledge score was computed, and
the average score calculated by dividing it by the total number of knowledge question. Knowledge was
then graded as excellent for scores of ≥80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. To
compute for handwashing practice, respondents who washed all critical parts of the hand were
categorized as having correct handwashing practice, while those who did not were classified as having
incorrect handwashing practice. Descriptive statistics was done, and results presented in tables.

Results
A total of 1,294 persons consented to participate in the study. The respondents aged between 18 and 80
years with 422 (32.6%) aged between 35 and 44 years. The average age was 39.6 years with a standard
deviation of 11.9 years. More than half of the respondents 710 (54.9%) were male, more than a third
were unemployed 476 (36.8%) with more than half having secondary education as their highest level of
education 685 (52.9%). Table 1

Causes of COVID 19

About 1,112 (87.5%) of the respondents who were aware of COVID 19 reported that the virus spreads
through contact with a person who is sick of coronavirus disease, 743 (58.5%) reported that it spreads
through contact with contaminated surfaces, beddings, or clothing of a person who is sick of coronavirus
disease, 727 (57.2%) reported that it spreads through hugging and kissing, 718 (56.5%) reported that it
spreads through touching blood, urine, stool or saliva from a person who is sick of coronavirus disease,
and 698 (54.9%) reported that it spreads through participation in burial rites of a person who has died
from coronavirus disease. Only 36 (2.8%) of the respondents reported that they do not know how COVID
19 spreads.
The three most frequent symptoms of COVID 19 identified by the respondents were fever 1,187 (93.4%)
cough 1,134 (89.2%) and difficulty in breathing 1,010 (79.5%). A total of 834 (66.4%) of respondents
were aware that the signs and symptoms of COVID 19 manifest in an infected person between 2 to 14
days after contracting the virus, 967 (76.1%) were aware that there is no specific drug treatment for
COVID 19, and 1006 (70.2%) were aware that there was no specific vaccine for COVID 19. Overall, 608
(47.0%) of the respondents had poor knowledge of COVID 19, 587 (45.4%) had good knowledge, while
only 99 (7.7%) had excellent knowledge about COVID 19. Table 3

Overall knowledge score

About 1167 (90.2%) of the respondents who are were aware of COVID 19 acknowledged that COVID 19
is a problem in the state because; It has no cure 817 (70.0%), it’s highly infectious 797 (68.3%), It’s a
deadly disease 788 (67.5%), and creates a lot of panic 779 (66.8). Those who did not consider COVID 19
a problem reported that it is just being exaggerated 64 (50.4%), that people just want to make money
with coronavirus intervention 52 (40.9%), and that they do not believe that there are cases of
coronavirus 47 (37.0%).
Four hundred and forty-three (34.9%) of the respondents believed they cannot contract the virus, while

801 (63.0%) acknowledged that the government is doing enough to contain the virus. Most respondents
would go to the hospital 905 (71.2%) or call the coronavirus help number 868 (68.3%) if they develop
signs and symptoms of COVID 19. A total of 743 (58.5%) of the respondents had heard of the
coronavirus helplines but only 116 (15.6%) of them could make it readily available when requested for.
Also, 522 (41.1%) had heard of the NCDC coronavirus information website/social media account, but
only 53 (10.2%) of them could make it readily available when requested for. A total of 833 (65.5%) of the
respondents claimed they were comfortable living or working with a person treated for COVID 19. Table

Discussion
It was heart-warming that awareness about COVID 19 infection among community-based residents in
the State was high, a few months after the index case of the disease was recorded. This was an
affirmation of broadcast media (radio and television) as the most viable channel for risk communication
within the State. Radio and Television as potent sources of information for the people and stand out as
channels for epidemic response efforts. They should therefore be engaged early and effectively. The
high level of awareness of COVID 19 found in this study, was similar to that obtained in China early in
the outbreak,8 but contrasted significantly from other studies in Nigeria, where COVID 19 awareness
remained poor several weeks after the pandemic.9,10 This observed awareness was closely followed by
good knowledge scores on COVID 19 transmission, signs, and symptoms of the disease such as fever,
cough and breathing difficulties in more than half of study respondents. This is also commendable

because knowledge of modes of disease transmission and signs and symptoms of a disease is the first
proactive step in understanding the measures of disease prevention and control, otherwise known as
primary prevention. Nevertheless, the good knowledge was not observed for slightly less than half of
respondents and did not sufficiently translate to good prevention practices among the people. This was
because while regular hand washing was reported to have been practised by most respondents, only a
third of the respondents satisfactorily demonstrated all handwashing steps. This supports the assertion
that knowledge does not always automatically translate into good practice without going through the
structured stages of declarative, procedural, and autonomous processes involved in the transition from
knowledge to practice.11 The finding has huge implications for the prevention and control of the
epidemic in the state and therefore cannot be glossed over by the Risk Communication Pillar of the
State Public Health Emergency Response. It suggests a paradigm shift in the risk communication process
in reprogramming its communication strategies to include skills based packages, in order to make any
significant, meaningful impacts in healthful behaviour change among the people concerning the COVID
19 virus transmission truncation in the state.
Also, found was the disturbing fact that a third of participants responded with a stigmatizing attitude
towards persons who have been treated for COVID 19. This was not peculiar to our study alone as other
researchers have reported similar occurrences in their environments.12,13 The fact that the disease is
new, with many unknowns and the fact people are often afraid of the unknown, evokes the fear factor
among individuals, including community dwellers. It is therefore understandable why there is confusion,
anxiety, and fear among the public. Unfortunately, however, these factors are also fuelling harmful
stereotypes and labels of individuals, which in turn drive discrimination and loss of status because of a
perceived link with the disease.12 The aftermath of which can drive the epidemic underground by
making people hide the illness to avoid discrimination, prevent people from seeking health care
immediately and discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours. All of these can result in more
severe health problems in the State by increasing the difficulties of controlling the disease outbreak.
Another salient issue that might have promoted stigma and discrimination was the unprofessional
manner the print and broadcast media portrayed the disease at inception, as a highly infectious and
deadly disease. And this created a lot of panic in the minds of the people as many persons developed
the perception that the disease as a huge problem. This thus created a paradox in the COVID 19 risk
communication in the State and further underscores the importance of periodic media engagement and
capacity building in ethical reporting and accurate information dissemination since the media are critical

partners in disease outbreak response.14
This study brings to the fore the relevance of adopting skills-based approaches in health risk
communication and the timely and effective media engagement on ethical reporting of health matters
during disease outbreaks to mitigate stereotyping, stigmatization and discrimination, all which have
severe implications for epidemic prevention and control.15 It is therefore recommended that the Risk
Communication Pillar of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre for COVID 19 in Rivers State
reprogramme its communication strategy to include sufficient practice elements that demonstrate the
correct COVID 19 prevention methods like hand hygiene, social distancing and appropriate use of face
masks.
The study was of a cross-sectional design which was based on self-reporting and therefore subject to
information bias, whereby respondents might choose not to give information as required. However, the
large sample size and spread of respondents across all the LGAs of the state make this a relevant piece
of research.

Conclusion
Risk communication interventions during pandemics need to be based on an understanding of the gaps
in knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and practice. Patronised communication channels such as
broadcast media should be maximally utilized to foster behaviour change communication for the control
of current and future epidemics.
