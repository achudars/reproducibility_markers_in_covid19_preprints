Abstract:
Comparisons between the mortality burdens of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza often fail to
account for the fact that the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reports annual influenza mortality estimates which are calculated based upon a series of
assumptions about the underreporting of flu deaths. COVID-19 deaths, in contrast, are being
reported as raw counts. In this report, we compare COVID-19 death counts to seasonal influenza
death counts in New York City during the interval from February 1 - April 18, 2020. Using this
approach, COVID-19 appears to have caused 21.4 times the number of deaths as seasonal
influenza during the same period. We also assessed excess mortality in order to verify this
finding. New York City has had approximately 13,032 excess all-cause mortality deaths during
this time period. We assume that most of these deaths are COVID-19 related. We therefore
calculated the ratio of excess deaths (i.e. assumed COVID-19 deaths) to seasonal influenza
deaths during the same time interval and found a similar ratio of 21.1 COVID-19 to seasonal
influenza deaths. Our findings are consistent with conditions on the ground today. Comparing
COVID-19 deaths with CDC estimates of yearly influenza-related deaths would suggest that, this
year, seasonal influenza has killed approximately the same number of Americans as COVID-19
has. This does not comport with the realities of the pandemic we see today.

Introduction:
Some experts now predict that COVID-19 will cause approximately 60,000 deaths in the United
States by August of 2020, seemingly similar to seasonal influenza mortality statistics in recent
years. However, such comparisons fail to account for differences in how deaths from SARSCoV-2 / COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are reported. Seasonal influenza mortality is reported
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as adjusted estimates, and also
includes pneumonia deaths caused by other pathogens. Between 2010 and 2019, the annual
estimates of influenza-associated and pneumonia deaths ranged from 12,000 and 61,000 deaths
per year [1, 2]. COVID-19 mortality, by contrast, is being tallied and reported as raw counts, and
has caused 13,240 in New York City alone, through April 18, 2020 [3, 4].
A more valid comparison between SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 and seasonal influenza-associated
mortality is possible by juxtaposing data obtained using similar methodologies--i.e. comparing
raw death counts for both diseases. However, this may not convince even some, as the
determination of a proximate cause of death that appears on death certificates rely upon
physician judgment and is prone to error [5]. Therefore, the New York City novel coronavirus
outbreak provides an unusual opportunity. According to the CDC there were approximately
13,032 excess deaths in New York City between February 1 and April 18, as compared to the
same interval in 2017-2019. It is reasonable to assume that these deaths were attributable to
COVID-19. Here, we compare the excess deaths in New York City to seasonal influenza counted
deaths over the 76-day interval, as well as counted COVID-19 deaths as reported by the CDC
and the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYDOH).

Methods:
Mortality statistics were obtained from the CDC and the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) and the NYDOC. Counted influenza deaths (ICD J09-J11) as reported to and by the
CDC/NCHS during the interval from February 1 to April 18, 2020 were compared to: 1) the
CDC’s reported number of excess deaths in New York city; 2) the CDC’s reported counted
number of deaths due either to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (ICD UO7.1) and; 3) the
NYDOH reported counted number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths. Mortality
ratios were calculated.

Results:
The CDC reports that between February 1 and April 18, the number of all-cause deaths was
171% of expected usual figures compared to the same interval in 2017-2019. The number of
New York City confirmed and “total” COVID-19 deaths (confirmed COVID-19 deaths plus
probable COVID-19 deaths, as reported by the NYDOH) was 21.4 times greater than the number
of counted influenza deaths reported by the CDC during the same interval (Table 1). The ratio of

all-cause excess mortality in New York City to influenza deaths during this time was 21.1. The
ratio of counted COVID-19 deaths (based on ICD codes reported to and by the CDC) was 9.5
times greater than influenza over the same time period.

Discussion:
Public officials and health and policy experts frequently quote CDC statistics that indicate that
nearly 61,000 Americans per year have died of influenza during the last seven seasons. However,
these are calculated estimates based upon numerous assumptions, all of which reinforce the
belief that influenza deaths are undercounted at multiple points in the healthcare system, from
under testing, to underreporting of hospitalization, to under attribution on death certificates.
During the current COVID-19 outbreak, approximately 40,000 Americans have died and
thousands more are expected to die in the coming months. Meanwhile, the CDC states that this
year, between 24,000 and 62,000 Americans have died of influenza [7]. Placed side-by-side, the
absurdity of these numbers is self-evident; conditions on the ground do not support statistics that
suggest that seasonal influenza has killed approximately the same if not many more Americans
than COVID-19 has. Instead, by abandoning the statistical misadventure of estimating influenza
deaths, and instead simply relying on reported counts, a far better quantitative and qualitative
portrait of the relative mortality burdens of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 and seasonal influenza
emerges.

This study has several limitations. First, while counted deaths are likely to be more accurate than
estimated deaths, both influenza and COVID-19 deaths may either be under or overreported. In
the case of COVID-19 deaths, it remains unclear who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection and who
died with the infection. However, the same forces can be applied to influenza counted deaths.
Second, while far lower than calculated estimates, influenza counted deaths may yet still be
overestimations, as ICD codes used (J09-J11) actually permit and do not exclude COVID-19 and
pneumonia (caused by other pathogens) from appearing on death certificates in which influenza
was determined to be the cause of death [3]. Third, while the 13,032 excess deaths in New York
City since February 1st may reasonably be attributed to COVID-19, this supposition cannot at
present be explicitly proven. Equally, however, it may be that the number of COVID-related
deaths is in fact greater than the number of excess deaths, as deaths from other causes, such as
trauma and even heart attacks, appears to have decreased during the shelter-in-place period of the
pandemic [6]. Fourth, the lower ratio of counted COVID-19 to influenza deaths calculated using
CDC numbers (in lieu of NYDOH figures) likely reflects lags in COVID-19 related deaths,
delays which the agency acknowledges openly. Such lags are less likely to affect influenza
deaths, as the peak of the season appears to have occurred in February. Finally, influenza deaths
have occurred throughout the 76-day period in this study. The first COVID-19 death in New
York City did not occur until March 11. Therefore, the ratios we report here may in fact
underestimate the relative mortality burden of COVID-19. The CDC has stated that week-toweek state-level data for 2020 may soon be published, which would allow comparisons of the
relative burdens of these two diseases at their peaks.
In conclusion, comparing actual influenza and COVID-19 deaths in the same city suggests that
COVID-19 mortality burden is indeed an order of magnitude greater than that of seasonal
influenza.
