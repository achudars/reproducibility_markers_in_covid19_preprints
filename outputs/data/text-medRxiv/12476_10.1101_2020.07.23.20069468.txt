The lack of active surveillance for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in the US has
hampered the ability to assess the relationship with predominantly biennial
epidemics of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare but serious neurological condition. Using novel surveillance data from the BioFire R Syndromic Trends
(Trend) epidemiology network, we characterize the epidemiological dynamics
of EV-D68 and demonstrate strong spatiotemporal association with AFM. Al1

though the recent dominant biennial cycles of EV-D68 dynamics may not be
stable, we show that a major EV-D68 epidemic, and hence an AFM outbreak,
would still be possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions. Significant social distancing due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could reduce the size of an EV-D68 epidemic in 2020, illustrating the potential broader
epidemiological impact of the pandemic.
Since 2012, cases of “polio-like” neurological syndromes of uncertain etiology have been
reported in the US (1, 2) and other countries (3). These syndromes, now referred to as acute
flaccid myelitis (AFM), are characterized by acute onset of flaccid limb weakness with lesions
in spinal cord grey matter (4). AFM has affected over 500 individuals in the US alone and
exhibits predominantly biennial patterns in the US (5) and internationally (6). Enterovirus D68
(EV-D68) appears to be the leading cause of AFM, though comprehensive understanding of
causality is still incomplete (7).
EV-D68 is a nonpolio enterovirus, previously associated with primarily respiratory symptoms (8). It was first discovered in 1962 (9) and was sporadically reported until 2014, when
a large EV-D68 outbreak associated with severe respiratory illnesses occurred in North America; millions of individuals were likely to have been infected in the US during this outbreak,
even though only 1,153 cases were confirmed in 49 states (10). Since then, EV-D68 outbreaks
have reoccurred every other year (2014, 2016, and 2018) in the US, coinciding with major
AFM outbreaks (11–13). Understanding the epidemiological dynamics of EV-D68 is critical
for assessing its causal relationship with AFM and potentially predicting the course of AFM
outbreaks.
Nonpolio enterovirus surveillance in the US currently relies on passive reporting through
the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) (14). A recent analysis of the NESS
data revealed a large geographical variation in the seasonality of nonpolio enteroviruses and

the roles of climatic variables in driving seasonal patterns (15). However, passive surveillance
has several limitations. As enterovirus reports are mostly outbreak-driven, the data are sparse
and do not reflect endemic dynamics of enteroviruses; thus only 26 cases of EV-D68 infection
were reported between 1970 and 2005 (14). The current gap in EV-D68 (as well as other
nonpolio enterovirus) surveillance limits our ability to investigate epidemiological dynamics of
circulation and association with AFM.
Here, we study EV-D68 dynamics using novel surveillance data collected from the BioFire R
Syndromic Trends (Trend) network (16). BioFire Trend provides near real-time surveillance
based on deidentified clinical test results using the BioFire R System (16). EV-D68 cases
are then predicted using a Pathogen Extended Resolution (PER) algorithm (see (16) for details, and Materials and Methods S1.1 for a summary) from the samples that tested positive
for rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) from the BioFire R FilmArray R Respiratory (RP) Panel results (17). We analyze PER-predicted EV-D68 cases across 24 states, consisting of 55 sites,
in the US between January 2014 and September 2019. We aggregated the data into 14 regions
by combining adjacent states such that each region has at least 3 contributing sites to meet the
confidentiality requirements. Separate permission was obtained from the sites in Missouri. This
unique data set allows us to characterize detailed spatiotemporal patterns of EV-D68 circulation,
which otherwise would not have been possible.
Fig. 1A presents time series of weekly proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases (n=9,913)
from RV/EV samples (n=165,036) in the US and in 5 regions with the biggest number of RV/EV
samples during the study period: New York (NY; n=37,430), Ohio (OH; n=22,448), Missouri
(MO; n=11,706), the Utah and Colorado region (UT+CO; n=20,880), and the Florida, Georgia,
and South Carolina region (FL+GA+SC; n=21,273). Time series of weekly proportion (as well
as number) of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases and weekly number of RV/EV cases for all 14 regions are presented in Supplementary Materials Fig. S1–S3. These time series demonstrate a

clear overall biennial pattern in the US, as well as a considerable variation in the PER-predicted
EV-D68 dynamics across different regions (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Materials, Fig. S1–S2).
For example, region-level PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics exhibit regular biennial (NY and
UT+CO), multiennial (MO and OH), and irregular dynamics (FL+GA+SC). These observations
are consistent with the results of wavelet analyses (Supplementary Materials, Fig. S4–S9; Materials and Methods S1.4). The absence of a major outbreak in Ohio, and possibly Missouri,
in 2016 (Fig. 1A; cf. (18)) is particularly surprising, given the apparent biennial pattern in the
US. Overall, the outbreaks in 2016 appear to be less synchronized, compared to the outbreaks

Pairwise cross-correlation plot between the two monthly time series at the national level using
all available EV-D68 and AFM data. (C) Comparison between the monthly proportion of PERpredicted EV-D68 cases at a one month lag and the monthly number of AFM cases at the
national level. The solid line is estimated from a linear regression. (D) Map of correlations
between annual proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases and the number of AFM cases
between 2014–2019 showing a positive association between the two. (E) Comparison between
the annual proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases and the annual number of AFM cases
across 14 regions (represented by different shapes for each region). Black line represents the
estimated fixed effects from a linear mixed model with random slopes and intercepts. Red lines
represents the estimated line for each region from a linear mixed model. All correlations are
measured after stabilizing time series variances (Materials and Methods S1.3). The axes in
Panel C and E are transformed to reflect the variance stabilization.
We characterize the geographical variation in the seasonal patterns of PER-predicted EVD68 dynamics by calculating the center of gravity (i.e., mean timing of cases (19)) for each
region (Fig. 1B; Materials and Methods S1.5). The centers of gravity vary from July to November. A bivariate regression analysis of the centers of gravity, using latitude and longitude of
the mean state capitals in each region as covariates, suggests a significant, latitudinal increase
(0.18 months per degree; 95% CI: 0.11 – 0.26; p < 0.001; Fig. 1C) and latitudinal decrease in
mean timing of cases (-0.020 months per degree; 95% CI: -0.038 – -0.002; p < 0.05; Fig. 1D).

These patterns are consistent with the observed patterns from the analyses of other nonpolio enteroviruses and poliomyelitis based on the NESS data and are likely driven by seasonal climatic
trends (15).

Spatiotemporal association between EV-D68 and AFM
A visual comparison of monthly time series of the number of confirmed AFM cases and the
proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases at the national level suggests a temporal association,
albeit with minor differences in their patterns (Fig. 2A). Notably, the peaks of AFM epidemics
occur in September, which is one month after the peaks of PER-predicted EV-D68 epidemics
(Fig. 2A). The pairwise cross-correlation between the two time series supports this observation
– the strongest correlation occurs at a one-month lag (Fig. 2B). This correlation is significant
(r = 0.7; p < 0.001; Fig. 2C).
A one-month lag is longer than the observed delay between onset of prodromal respiratory
symptoms and AFM from clinical studies; the estimated median delays range from 2 to 8 days
across studies (20–24). Our estimated lag is likely to be caused by two approximations. First,
the AFM data are reported at a monthly scale, meaning that delays smaller than one month
are difficult to assess. Second, there are variations in AFM reporting, which reflects differential
awareness and its passive nature (25), as well as differential deployment of the BioFire R System
(see Supplementary Text S2.1). Given state-level variations in the temporal patterns of EV-D68
circulation (Fig. 1A), comparing the national AFM cases with the PER-predicted EV-D68 cases
from 18 states is likely to exaggerate the differences.
The proportions of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases in 2014, 2016 and 2018 remain roughly
constant (Fig. 2A), whereas the number of confirmed AFM cases in 2018 (n = 238) nearly
doubled compared to that in 2014 (n = 120). Although this pattern is likely to reflect increased
surveillance efforts and awareness of AFM (25), other factors could have played a role. For

example, phylogenetic analyses of recent EV-D68 outbreaks have demonstrated the spread of
different lineages in different years (26). Although it remains unclear whether neurotropism is
a recently acquired trait (27, 28), some studies have suggested that a subset of contemporary
EV-D68 strains are more neurovirulent than the prototypical 1962 strain (27,29). Future studies
may consider whether increased neurovirulence of recent EV-D68 strains is associated with the
increased number of AFM cases. Geographically isolated sporadic AFM outbreaks associated
with other nonpolio enteroviruses (e.g., enterovirus A71 outbreak in 2018 Colorado (30)) could
have contributed to the increased number of AFM cases in certain areas.
We find strong (though noisy), positive correlations between the annual number of confirmed AFM cases and the proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases in most regions (Fig. 2D;
Supplementary Materials, Fig. S11–13). We use a permutation test to quantify the significance
of the average of these correlations (r = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.33–0.69; p < 0.001). A linear mixed
effects analysis with random intercepts and slopes across regions further supports the positive
temporal association between AFM and PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics (p < 0.001; Fig. 2E;
Supplementary Materials, Fig. S12). Even though there is a large regional variation in the
PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics (Fig. 1; Fig. S1–S2) and the observed AFM dynamics (Supplementary Materials, Fig. S13), we find clear biennial patterns in both across all four census
regions (except for the PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics in the Midwest; Supplementary Materials, Fig. S14). These results indicate that the biennial association between EV-D68 and AFM
is robust across the US.

Epidemiological model fitting
We use an epidemiological model to test whether an interaction between prolonged, serotypespecific immunity and an increase in the susceptible pool via birth (post maternal immunity)
can explain the state-level variation in the observed EV-D68 dynamics. Pons-Salort and Grassly

(31) showed that the acquisition of serotype-specific immunity can explain complex dynamics
observed in other nonpolio enterovirus surveillance data from Japan: in general, large outbreaks
reduce the number of susceptible individuals significantly and will be followed by a series of
small outbreaks until a sufficient number of susceptible individuals have been added to the
population through birth. Like them, we use a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)
model that assumes homogeneous mixing, seasonally varying transmission rates, and realistic
birth and death rates (Supplementary Materials, Fig. S15; Materials and Methods S1.2). We
find maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of model parameters by fitting the model to time
series of proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases between January 2014 and December 2017
from the 4 regions that we presented earlier (Fig. 1); we do not fit the model to the Florida,
Georgia, and South Carolina region because two epidemic peaks in 2016 come from different
states, which cannot be captured by our model. Fitting the model to data from other regions
are precluded by the sparsity of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases. We then assess whether our
SIR model can accurately predict out-of-sample EV-D68 dynamics by projecting model fits
until September 2019. All confidence intervals are calculated by importance sampling (32). A
detailed explanation of the methods is given in Materials and Methods S1.6–S1.7.
Our simple, mechanistic model can capture the PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics from 2014
to 2017 in all 4 regions (Fig. 3A). Our model fits also demonstrate that the observed regional
variations in EV-D68 dynamics are consistent with model parameter variations; however, some
of these variations may be caused by the brevity and crudeness of the time series, as well as the
simplicity of the model (see Discussion), and may not reflect real differences among states. All
parameter estimates are presented in Supplementary Materials Fig. S16–S20 and Table S2–S5.
We estimate similar ranges of time-varying effective reproductive number Rt (i.e., the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual over the course of an epidemic (33)) between 2014 and 2017 for all 4 regions (Supplementary Materials, Fig. S21):

susceptible population): New York (29.5; 95% CI: 26.8–32.7), Ohio (10.7; 95% CI: 8.4–13.0),
Missouri (20.6; 95% CI: 17.0–27.7) and the Utah and Colorado region (14.6; 95% CI: 10.9–
18.5). Since epidemiological dynamics of endemic diseases, such as EV-D68, are driven by
Rt , high estimates of R0 are likely to be correlated with low estimates of S(0). Not explicitly
accounting for age structure, metapopulation structure, and heterogeneity in the population is
also likely to have affected our estimates (34).
Predicting future EV-D68 dynamics from a short time series is difficult. Our model predicts EV-D68 outbreaks in the Utah and Colorado region and in Missouri reasonably well but
imperfectly in Ohio and New York. While the model predicts a large outbreak New York in
2018 (Fig. 3A), the observed outbreak in 2018 occurred later in the year and was smaller than
the outbreaks in 2014 and 2016. This mismatch suggests that the observed pattern of EV-D68
spread in 2018 New York may be different from the biennial outbreaks observed in 2014 and
2016.
We tested whether our simple model can explain the patterns in 2018 by fitting the same
model to the New York and Ohio time series, including the outbreak in 2018. We find that
our model can then explain the apparent changes in the EV-D68 dynamics in 2018 reasonably
well (Fig. 3B). However, the new model fit does not necessarily provide better predictions for
the dynamics in 2019; this lack of fit is partly driven by anomalies in the data (e.g., the PER
algorithm predicts almost no EV-D68 cases in Ohio and in the Utah and Colorado region in
2019).
Including the outbreaks from New York and Ohio in 2018 into our model fitting yields much
closer estimates of R0 : New York (17.0; 95% CI: 15.9 – 19.7) and Ohio (14.8; 95% CI: 13.8
– 16.5). These changes in the estimated basic reproductive number can suggest a transition
in the long-term dynamics to cycles of different periodicity (35). While both parameter sets
give qualitatively similar fits to 2014–2017 time series, the initial parameter estimate provides

a quantitatively better fit for the first 4 years (a difference of 17 and 21 log-likelihood units for
New York and Ohio, respectively); these differences confirm that our initial parameter estimates
are well-identified. Given the brevity of the time series, it is not surprising that there are multiple
parameter combinations that give qualitatively similar short-term dynamics but different longterm dynamics.
Finally, we explore the long-term stability of the EV-D68 attractors using a bifurcation diagram of the deterministic SIR model (Fig. 4A; Materials and Methods S1.8). We rely on
estimated parameters for New York, since it has the best available data for EV-D68. The bifurcation diagram predicts predominantly annual cycles in Ohio (excluding 2018) and the Utah
and Colorado region although multiple attractors may coexist (indicated by the fine-grained
pattern of colors representing different cycle periods; cf. (35)); dynamical transitions due to
stochasticity may drive irregular patterns in these regions. Our model predicts a stable, longterm biennial cycle in New York (excluding 2018) and Missouri, but their parameters lie near
the edge of a dynamical transition that divides the biennial regime from irregular (New York)
and annual (Missouri) regimes. On the other hand, parameter estimates that include the 2018
outbreaks in New York and Ohio are closer together and are within an annual regime, suggesting that the patterns observed in 2014-2017 might have been a transient feature. Although these
results suggest that the observed biennial pattern may not be stable in the long term, stochastic
simulations show that a moderate to large outbreak, comparable to that in 2014, is possible between August and September 2020 across the ranges of parameters we estimate for New York
if epidemiological conditions remain unchanged (Fig. 4B).
In practice, massive non-pharmaceutical (social distancing) efforts in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could reduce average contact rates during 2020 (36). We explore
the potential impact of these actions on EV-D68 dynamics in Fig. 4C–E. If average transmission rate is reduced by more than 10%, a major EV-D68 outbreak is unlikely to occur. Note

that we do not explore longer term dynamics, arising from the consequent increase in EV-D68
susceptibility.

Discussion
Here, we present the first spatiotemporal analysis of EV-D68 dynamics in the US and its population correlation with cases of AFM. Our analysis reveals spatial variation in the patterns of
spread of EV-D68. We showed that these variations are correlated with latitude and longitude
and can be explained by a simple SIR model at the state level. These observations are consistent with previous studies of enteroviruses and are likely climate-driven (15, 31). Finally, our
analyses suggest that the predominant medium-term biennial dynamics in the spread of EV-D68
may not necessarily be stable. Given uncertainties in EV-D68 dynamics as well as in behavioral
changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the occurrence or the size of EV-D68 outbreaks in
2020 remains unclear.
There is currently a lack of data to characterize more detailed epidemiological dynamics of
EV-D68. Even though EV-D68 has been circulating for at least 60 years (9), our data from the
PER algorithm, which predicts the presence of EV-d68, only span the last 6 years. The passive
surveillance data is expected to be even sparser. Based on such short time series, it is difficult to
assess whether the observed patterns will persist. Nonetheless, our simple model captures the
observed dynamics reasonably well and allows us to make useful predictions about the course
of the epidemic; these predictions will become firmer as more data becomes available. More
broadly, this analysis underlines the power of leveraging novel sources of large-sample surveillance data (37). While the BioFire Trend data permit a step change in analysis, surveillance
based on constant sampling effort would be much more powerful. Population-representative
incidence and serological data by state (as well as internationally) would allow us to further
characterize the dynamics of EV-D68 and its association with AFM.

An important criterion for probing the causality between EV-D68 and AFM is their temporality at the individual level (i.e., infection of EV-D68 has to precede the onset of neurological
symptoms (7)), which is supported by the observed onset of respiratory illnesses (38) and the
detection of EV-D68 (39,40) prior to the onset of AFM. Our cross-scale comparison of EV-D68
and AFM dynamics revealed robust correlations between the timing of EV-D68 and AFM cases,
providing additional ecological support for a causal link.
Our dynamic model relied on several simplifying assumptions about the biology of EVD68. For example, we assumed that the infectious period distribution follows an exponential distribution with a mean of 7 days. Although Pons-Salort and Grassly (31) showed that
nonpolio enterovirus dynamics in Japan can be explained sufficiently well under the same assumption, assumptions about the shape of the infectious period distribution can affect model
dynamics (41, 42) as well as R0 estimates (43). More importantly, ignoring potential uncertainties in model parameters (e.g., assuming that the mean infectious period is known) can
underestimate the overall uncertainties associated with the conclusion (44). We also did not test
for other mechanisms (e.g., changes in pathogenicity, antigenicity or transmissibility (31) or
interactions with other nonpolio enteroviruses (45)) that could account for the apparent change
in epidemiological dynamics in New York in 2018. Future phylodynamics models (46) should
explore integrated epidemiological and viral genetic dynamics. We also did not account for age
structure, strength of immunity, and spatial coupling between states; these simplifications are
likely to have affected our estimates of the basic reproductive number. Predictions about the
stability of the biennial cycles should be interpreted with caution as our analysis relies on short
time series. Our preliminary analysis of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is necessarily
crude. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 and EV-D68 are likely to have very different mean ages of
transmission. Nonetheless, current behavioral changes are profound across ages; significant
impact of EV-D68 dynamics seems likely.

Despite the simplicity of the analysis, we can draw robust conclusions about key aspects
of EV-D68 dynamics. First, the PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics are consistent with the importance of transmission-blocking herd immunity. Second, although our estimates of the R0
are necessarily approximate, they are likely to be relatively high (> 10). This is consistent
with a low median age of infection for EV-D68 (5 years (47)) as well as R0 estimates for other
nonpolio enteroviruses exhibiting biennial cycles in Japan (e.g., R0 = 16.2 for Coxsackievirus
A2 and R0 = 32.7 Coxsackievirus A4 (31)). The successful SIR model fits also imply that
vaccination could tentatively control the spread of EV-D68, but herd immunity thresholds are
likely to be high (31).
Although there is large uncertainty associated with the stability of the observed biennial pattern, we predict that a major EV-D68 outbreak can occur in the near future. Based on the low
number of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases in 2019, we would expect the number of susceptible
individuals to have increased, enhancing the probability for a large outbreak to occur. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic response may significantly impact the
dynamics of a 2020 EV-D68 outbreak; if social distancing prevents the outbreak from occurring, the susceptible pool may increase even further. There are several such potential impacts of
pandemic social distancing on other infections; predicting these effects and testing such models
against the actuality will be a powerful test of the effects of contact reduction. We propose that
mainly ‘ecological’ interactions, such as between SARS-CoV-2 and EV-D68 (48), will generate weaker effects than interactions mediated by acquired immunity with SARS-CoV-2’s close
relatives, which affect the susceptible pool (49).
Improved real-time surveillance, such as the BioFire Trend system, may serve as an important early warning system for impending outbreaks and improve epidemiological modeling
to better understand and predict future patterns of circulation. As the PER algorithm is likely
no longer to function after this year due to a product update, future research should therefore

Materials and Methods
Epidemiological data

The Pathogen Extended Resolution (PER) algorithm, designed to distinguish EV-D68 from
other rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (RV/EV), was developed using data from the BioFire R
FilmArray R Respiratory (RP) Panel. The BioFire RP Panel is a multiplex nested RTPCR test capable of detecting up to 20 respiratory pathogens found in respiratory samples
obtained from patients exhibiting respiratory disease symptoms. PER incorporates real-time
polymerase chain reaction metrics from the BioFire RP Panel RV/EV assays as model inputs. PER was tuned and tested using data from 1,619 samples spanning two years, from
six institutions in the United States and Europe. The samples were confirmed for EVD68 by gold-standard molecular methods at the six institutions. The final PER algorithm
demonstrated an overall sensitivity and specificity of 87.1% and 86.1%, respectively, among
the gold-standard dataset. PER works in conjunction with BioFire R Syndromic Trends
(Trend), an epidemiology network that connects participating BioFire R Systems to a centralized database, to predict rates of EV-D68 on a population level. PER has been used as
a real time monitoring tool to alert participating sites of predicted EV-D68 circulation and
was in effect during the previous 2018 outbreak [1].
Monthly and annual time series of confirmed AFM cases is obtained from the CDC website
(https://www.cdc.gov/acute-flaccid-myelitis/cases-in-us.html. Accessed February 11, 2020).
The monthly time series is extracted from the website using WebPlotDigitizer [2].

S1.2

Demographic data

The monthly numbers of births and deaths in each state between 2014–2017 are obtained
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Wonder database [3; 4]. The
population sizes in each state and in each city (only including the cities from which samples
were collected) are obtained from the Census Bureau website [5]. Birth and death rates are
estimated by dividing the monthly numbers of births and deaths by the total population size
in each state and interpolating with cubic splines. For our epidemiological model, we adjust
the population size to account for the cities from which samples were collected by using the
sum of population sizes of those cities, instead of the population size of each state.

S1.3

Variance stabilization of a time series

Before we measure cross-correlations or perform wavelet analyses of time series, we transform
the time series to stabilize their variances. Integers (e.g., number of reported AFM cases) are
log-transformed after adding 1: log(x+1) [6]. Proportions (e.g.,
√ proportion of PER-predicted
EV-D68 cases) are arcsine-square-root transformed: arcsin( x) [7].

S1.4

Wavelet analysis

We perform Morlet wavelet analyses of the arcsine-square-root transformed proportion of
PER-predicted EV-D68 cases to characterize the periodicity of the observed EV-D68 cycles.
Confidence intervals are calculated from 100 bootstrap samples. The analyses are performed
using the “WaveletComp” R package.

S1.5

Center of gravity

The center of gravity is calculated by taking the average of weeks in each even year (2014,
2016, and 2018), weighted by the proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases, and then
taking the mean of these averages [8]. We only use epidemics that occur during the even
years to characterize the patterns of major epidemics. Center of gravity is calculated using
circular statistics with the “circular” R package [9].

S1.6

Epidemiological model

We use a homogeneous, stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with realistic
birth and death rates to describe the spread of EV-D68 in each state [10] and fit the model
to weekly proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases. The model is an Euler approximation
of a continuous-time SIR model [11]. For simplicity, we discretize both the simulation and
the observation time steps at a scale of 1 week (∆t = 1 week):
Bt ∼ Poisson(bt N ∆t)

∆St ∼ Binom 1 − e−(βt (It +ω)/N +dt )∆t , St
St+∆t = Bt + St − ∆St


βt (It + ω)/N
, ∆St
Ct ∼ Binom
βt (It + ω)/N + dt

∆It ∼ Binom 1 − e−(γ+dt )∆t , It
It+∆t = Ct + It − ∆It

(1)

where bt and dt are the estimated time-varying birth and death rates, βt is the time-varying
transmission rate, γ is the recovery rate, and ω is the constant external forcing term. For
computational efficiency, we do not keep track of the recovered population R and assume
that the population N stays constant. This does not mean that we are letting the birth and
death rates equal; the birth and death rates vary over time to reflect the observed number of
birth and death. We are simply keeping the N in the denominator of the force of infection
(βI/N ) and in the total expected birth bt N constant. Given that our time series is very
short, assuming a constant N has negligible effects on the epidemiological dynamics as well
as parameter estimates.
We model transmission rate βt using cyclic B-splines with 5 knots, at intervals of 1/4

where αi represent spline coefficients and φi represent spline bases. The mean transmission

We initially used a sinusoidal function to model the transmission rate but found that it was
not able to capture the steepness of epidemic curves.
In order to model the probability of detecting a positive case in a sample, we first assume
that there is an average, baseline rate ρ0 at which the total population gets tested. Then,
the average total number of individuals that get tested between time t and t + ∆t is given
by
Z
t+∆t

ρ0 N (s)ds = ρ0 N ∆t.

On the other hand, we assume that newly infected individuals get tested at a rate ρ1 . Then,
the probability of detecting EV-D68 in a sample at time t is given by
Pt =

ρ 1 Ct
.
ρ0 N ∆t

(5)

We reparameterize this model by writing λ = ρ1 /ρ0 , which represents the relative rate at
which individuals infected with EV-D68 get tested compared to the rest of the population.
Although it is possible to explicitly model individuals that have already been tested and those
that have not yet been tested, our method provides a simple, but reasonable, approximation
when the prevalence is low and the generation time is short.
Finally, we model the observed number of EV-D68 cases Cobs,t using a beta-binomial
model:
Cobs,t ∼ BetaBinom(Pt , Nobs,t , θ),
(6)
where Nobs,t represent the observed number of individuals tested positive for RV/EV at time
t, and θ represents the Beta-binomial over-dispersion parameter. This observation model
assumes that there is a constant rate at which individuals, on average, get tested for RV/EV;
in reality, we expect the testing rate to fluctuate over time depending on the seasonalities
of RV/EV serotypes. We are unable to model this fluctuation explicitly because we have
incomplete information about the observed RV/EV serotypes within samples. We implicitly
account for this fluctuation in the beta-binomial likelihood by incorporating the observed
number of RV/EV samples. We implement the model using the R package pomp [12].

S1.7

Inferential framework

Following [10], we assume γ = 1/7 days−1 . Then, we try to find the maximum likelihood
estimates (MLEs) of the remaining model parameters: initial proportion of infected individuals I(0) at the beginning of 2014, initial proportion of susceptible individuals S(0) at the
beginning of 2014, four spline coefficients α1 , α2 , α3 , α4 , external forcing term ω, relative rate
at which individuals infected with EV-D68 get tested λ, and the beta-binomial dispersion
parameter θ. In order to find the MLEs, we first construct 50 starting parameter sets for the
model that assumes a sinusoidal transmission rate, i.e., βt = βm (1 + βs cos(2π(t + A))), using
Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). For each LHS sample, we perform trajectory matching.
Starting from the parameter set estimated from the trajectory matching, we fit the stochastic model using the iterated, perturbed Bayes map (IF2) algorithm [13]. We use 300 MIF
iterations with 5000 particles during this step.
For each stochastic fit using a sinusoidal transmission rate, we translate the sinusoidal
function parameters (βm , βs and A) into spline coefficients by performing a linear regression
using the estimated time-varying transmission rates as a response variable and spline bases
as covariates. We fit the stochastic model with spline-based transmission rates using the
IF2 algorithm, starting from the parameters we estimated from the previous step. We use
600 MIF iterations with 5000 particles during this step. For each fit, we calculate the loglikelihood by taking logarithm of the mean of the 10 replicates of the particle-filter likelihoods,
each using 10000 particles. The resulting parameter set with the highest log-likelihood is
the MLEs of the model parameters. We expect this two-step approach to converge better
than a one-step approach that tries to estimate spline coefficients directly from LHS samples
because the latter approach could give unrealistic shapes of the transmission rates as starting
points.
To calculate the 95% confidence intervals associated with each parameter, we use importance sampling [14]. We first transform the MLEs of the model parameters to unconstrained
scales: parameters confined to positive values are log-transformed, and those confined between 0 and 1 are logit-transformed. We draw 5000 random parameter sets from a multivariate normal distribution, using the transformed MLEs as the mean, and calculate the
particle-filter likelihood at each point using 10000 particles. The weight of each parameter
set is calculated by dividing the particle-filter likelihood by the sampling probability density of the parameter set. The weighted parameter samples give an approximate posterior
distribution that assumes flat priors on all parameters on unconstrained scales. We use the
scaled variance-covariance matrix of the parameter sets that were proposed during IF2 steps,
which are less than 4 log-likelihood units away from the log-likelihood of the MLEs, as the
variance-covariance matrix of the multivariate normal proposal distribution. The scaling
factors for the variance-covariance matrix are determined through trial-and-error so that the
importance samples can explore a sufficiently wide range of parameters; the scaling factors
vary between 10 and 100 across different regions. Confidence intervals are calculated by
taking the weighted quantiles of the approximate posterior distribution.
To validate importance sampling confidence intervals, we compare them with the approximate profile confidence intervals. Approximate log-likelihood profiles are calculated by

dividing the marginal importance samples into 50 equi-spaced bins on unconstrained scales
and taking the maximum log-likelihood in each bin. We fit a Locally Estimated Scatterplot
Smoothing (LOESS) regression to maximum log-likelihoods across 50 bins and calculate the
confidence intervals for each parameter from the estimated log-likelihood profile curves from
the LOESS regression. Both methods give consistent results (Fig. S16–S21).

S1.8

Bifurcation diagram

Long-term dynamics of childhood diseases and their dynamical transitions can be predicted
from bifurcations of a deterministic model [15; 16]. Here, we use a bifurcation diagram to
study long-term stability of the observed biennial cycles. For each combination of relative
amplitude and R0 , we run the deterministic model for 200 years (in order to remove any
transient dynamics) assuming equal birth and death rates (using birth rates from New York,
2014) to keep the population at demographic equilibrium. Then, we calculate the mean
periodicity from the wavelet analysis of the final 100 years of logged incidence. The estimated
R0 for each state is adjusted by multiplying the relative average birth rate, compared to the
average birth rate in New York.

Geographical differences in EV-D68 and AFM surveillance

The biggest numbers of AFM cases are reported from California (89 out of 606 total cases),
where the observed peak month matches the observed peak month at the national level
[17], and Texas (63 out of 606 cases). PER-predicted EV-D68 reports from the BioFire R
Trend are concentrated in Northeast and Midwest regions (6534 out of 10395 total cases),
particularly in New York (2478 out of 10395 total cases), but are sparse in California and
Texas (446 out of 10395 total cases). These differences are likely to play important roles
in shaping the differences in seasonality of the PER-predicted EV-D68 dynamics and the
observed AFM patterns at the national level.

Figure S10: A comparison of weekly proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases
across 14 regions. Thick orange bands in 2014 and 2018 suggest that the outbreaks are
synchronized in many states. A lack of orange band in 2016 suggests that the outbreaks are
not synchronized. Regions are ranked by the mean latitude of the capital city of each states.

Figure S11: A fine scale comparison of weekly proportion of PER-predicted EVD68 cases and weekly number of AFM cases in New York and Colorado. The
black bars represent the weekly proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases. The red bars
represent the weekly number of AFM cases, except for those that are known to be associated
with EV-A71. The blue bars represent weekly number of AFM cases that are known to
be associated with EV-A71. AFM reports from New York and Colorado are obtained from
the New York State Department of Health and Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment, respectively. While the AFM cases are from Colorado in the right panel, we
present PER-predicted proportion of EV-D68 cases from both Utah and Colorado due to
confidentiality requirements.

Figure S12: A comparison of annual proportion of PER-predicted EV-D68 cases
and annual number of AFM cases across 14 regions with lines estimated from
a linear mixed model with random slopes and intercepts. Black lines represent
the individual-level prediction using random effect estimates (conditional modes). Red lines
represent the population-level prediction using fixed effect estimates. Regions are ranked by
the estimated random slopes.

Ethical statement
The data are de-identified at the institutions prior to export to the Syndromic Trends
database according to HIPAA standards and BioFire enters into a Data Use Agreement with
each institution which controls the use of the data and protects against re-identification of
any individual. This analysis relied on de-identified data only. We did not seek for additional
approval to conduct this study from an ethical review board.
