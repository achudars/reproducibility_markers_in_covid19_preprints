Abstract
Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline in the fight against COVID-19 and are at an
increased risk of becoming infected with coronavirus. Risk of infection can be minimized by use
of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). This study assessed the availability of PPE and
satisfaction of HCPs in six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was
conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020. The study hospitals included: Tikur Anbessa Specialized
Hospital, Zewditu Memorial Hospital, Ghandi Memorial Hospital, Menelik II Hospital, Yekatit 12
Hospital Medical College and St. Paul Hospital Millennium Medical College. Data were collected
using a self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the data and
Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups. Bivariate and multivariable
logistic regression models were used to assess factors associated with the satisfaction level of
healthcare workers with regard to the availability and use of proper PPE during the current
COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1,134 (92.3%) valid questionnaires from a possible 1,228 were
included in the analysis. The mean (±SD) age of the participants was 30.26±6.43 year and 52.6%
were females. Nurses constituted about 40% of the overall sample, followed by physicians
(22.2%), interns (10.8%), midwives (10.3%) and others (16.7%). An overall shortage of PPE was
reported in all study hospitals. The majority (77%) of the healthcare professionals reported that
their hospital did not have adequate PPE. A critical shortage of N95 respirator was particularly
reported, the self-reported availability of N95 increased from 13% to 24% before and during
COVID-19, respectively. The self-reported use of N95 increased from 9% to 21% before and
during COVID-19, respectively. Almost 72% of the respondents were dissatisfied with the
availability of PPE in their hospital. The independent predictors of the respondents’ satisfaction
level about PPE were male gender (adjusted OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85), healthcare workers who
reported that PPE was adequately available in the hospital (adjusted OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.082

11.16), and preparedness to provide care to COVID-19 cases (adjusted OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.222.12). A critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during COVID-19 was identified.
The high level of dissatisfaction with the availability of PPE might potentially lead to a lower level
of preparedness and readiness to fight against COVID-19. Therefore, urgent efforts are needed to
adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate PPE to alleviate the challenges.

Introduction
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020 [1]. Worldwide, the pandemic has caused over 41
million confirmed cases and more than 1.1 million as of 22nd Oct 2020 2020 [2]. The African
continent has the lowest number of globally confirmed cases, standing roughly at 1,685,589 and
registering 40,690 deaths. As of 22nd October 2020, Ethiopia has confirmed 91,693 COVID-19
cases, 1,396 deaths, and 45,260 recoveries from over 1,423,505 tests performed to date. At the
moment, Ethiopia stood at 4th from Africa in terms of the reported number of confirmed COVID19 cases next to South Africa (1st), Egypt (2nd) and Morocco (3rd). Thus far the case fatality rate of
Ethiopia, which represents 1.5% of the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases, is less than the
average for Africa (2.4%) and the world (3.3%). Nonetheless, recent reports from the country
suggest a spiking rate of coronavirus transmission in the community [3].

Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the frontline of defense in combating COVID-19 and they
play a critical role, not only in the management of COVID-19 patients, but also in ensuring
adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in healthcare settings. As a result, they
are at a substantially increased risk of becoming infected with the virus and could potentially
contribute to the transmission [4-6]. In Ethiopia, over 1,311 health workers have contracted
coronavirus as of 17th September 2020. About 11% of HCPs retrospectively studied in Spain had
tested for COVID-19 [7]. Early evidence from countries with the highest mortality rates indicates
that healthcare workers are considerably at greater risk of being infected with COVID-19 ranging
from 15% to 20% of the infected population and are therefore at a disproportionate risk to the rest
of the population [8,9]. For instance, the Italian Regional Reference Laboratories reported that

healthcare workers accounted for 10% of 162,000 cases of COVID-19 in the country [10].
Similarly, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that accounted for about
11% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States between [11].

Infection prevention and control (IPC) measures such as the use of appropriate PPE, proper
handwashing, and hand hygiene are critical in preventing the transmission and risk of infection of
COVID-19 in healthcare settings. The use of appropriate PPE by healthcare workers in particular
during the current COVID-19 pandemic is highly recommended and the national and international
safety protocols for healthcare workers should be strictly followed [1,12]. Since the initial outbreak
report of COVID-19 in China in December 2019, there has been an increasing demand for PPE
globally. In many healthcare settings particularly in Africa HCPs have limited access to
appropriate PPE to protect their health in many healthcare settings [6]. As a result, many healthcare
workers remain concerned about the risk of infection from the SARS-COV-2 due to the shortage
of appropriate PPE recommended by WHO, and they have become ill-equipped to care for patients
with COVID-19 or other causes, due to acute shortage of appropriate PPE [13].

A lack of PPE puts both HCPs and patients at risk of contracting coronavirus infection. It also
presents many HCPs with challenging decisions about whether to care and provide treatment for
COVID-19 patients in the absence of effective PPE. In addition, compliance with guidance on the
correct use of PPE in healthcare setting is another challenge. On the other hand, the number of
COVID-19 cases is rising and the shortages in PPE remains a major concern. The purpose of this
study was to assess the self-reported availability and use of PPE as well as satisfaction level of
HCPs practicing in public hospitals in Addis Ababa during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
Study area and setting
A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 at six public
hospitals in Addis Ababa city administration, three months after the first confirmed COVID-19
case in Ethiopia in March 2020. Addis Ababa city is the most populated urban city in Ethiopia,
and is home to about 17% of the urban dwellers in the country. In 2019, the city had a projected
population of about 3.6 million and accounted for 3.7% of the total population [14]. The city has
the highest number of health infrastructure and medical personnel compared with any city or
region in the country. There were 12 hospitals and close to 100 health centers belonging to the
public center, and about 25 private hospitals in Addis Ababa city. There were also over 17,000
HCPs in the city, including 2,441 (14%) physicians and 8,172 (47%) nurses by the end of July
2019. Addis Ababa city has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia. As of 22nd
Oct 2020, a total of 46,570 confirmed COVID-19 confirmed cases and 122 deaths were reported
in Addis Ababa [15]. The hospitals selected for the current study were the leading hospitals in the
country and provided outpatient and inpatient services for the city residents and patients coming
from different parts of the country.
Study population and sampling
Of the 12 government hospitals in Addis Ababa city administration, the following six were
purposively selected based on the relatively higher number of health work forces: Tikur Anbessa
Specialized Hospital (TASH), Zewditu Memorial Hospital (ZMH), Ghandi Memorial Hospital
(GMH), Menelik II Hospital (MH), Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College (Y12HMC) and St. Paul
Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC). The study population included all categories
of HCPs practicing in the selected hospitals at the time of the survey. In this study, HCP is defined

as a healthcare provider in the selected hospital involved in the provision of healthcare services
including intern doctors, resident doctors, general practitioners, medical specialists and subspecialists, health officers, anesthetists, nurses, midwives, laboratory technologists, radiologists,
physiotherapists, X-ray and laboratory technicians. The study targeted the HCPs since they are the
majority involved in a number of healthcare activities which render them at risk of acquiring and
transmitting infections.

Sample size was calculated using a single cross-sectional study design formula based on a 50%
prevalence estimate of the availability of PPE in the hospital at 95% confidence level, 4%
precision, a design effect of 1.5 and 25% non-response rate. Accordingly, the minimum total
sample size targeted for this survey was 1,200 respondents. A mix of purposive and random
sampling was applied to select participants based on their availability and willingness to participate
in the study. In each hospital, the types and number of wards were initially identified and the
number of healthcare workers within each ward was obtained from the human resource
department. The sample size allocated to the hospital was distributed to the wards proportional to
the size of their healthcare workers. Since it was difficult to obtain the complete list of healthcare
workers in each ward at the time of the study, proper random sampling was not followed to select
the study participants. Some healthcare workers in particular physicians or nurses were on duty,
some were working in different departments in the same hospital or another hospital, and others
were reluctant to accept the invitation to participate in the study. The list of the available voluntary
healthcare workers was obtained and a simple random sampling was applied to select potential
respondents based on the sample size allocated to each ward. All eligible participants who
consented to participate were recruited into the study.

Data collection
Date were collected using structured paper-based self-administered questionnaires that composed
of sections on demographic and occupational characteristics of the respondents (e.g., gender, age,
education and years of work experience), working unit, availability and practices regarding
compliance with usage of PPE (gloves, gowns, facemask, N95 respirator, goggles, face shields,
and hair covers), as well as their main concerns and worries about the availability and use of proper
PPE during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The satisfaction level of HCPs regarding the
availability and use of PPE included four items: (1) I am satisfied with the current availability of
PPE in my hospital during the COVID-19, (2) I am satisfied with the current use of PPE by health
professionals in my hospital, (3) I am satisfied that the correct PPE (as recommended by WHO) is
always available to me when managing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient in my hospital,
and (4) I am satisfied that the correct PPE (as recommended by WHO) is always available to me
when treating non-COVID-19 patients in my hospital. These items were measured using a fivepoint Likert scale, where 1-strongly dissatisfied, 2-dissatisfied, 3-average, 4-satisfied, and 5strongly satisfied.

The questionnaire was developed in English based on related literature and available national and
international PPE guidelines. A total of 12 experienced data collectors with health backgrounds
were involved in data collection. One data collector per hospital was independently recruited and
trained for this purpose, while one assistant healthcare workers was recruited from each hospital
to facilitate and assist the data collection process. A guideline was developed by the research team
to guide the data collectors, assistant healthcare workers and supervisors for data collection, quality
assurance of data and ethical conduct during implementation of the survey. The components of the

guidelines included sections on selection of respondents, data collection procedures using selfadministered questionnaire, and ethical issues including COVID-19 infection prevention
measures. Training and orientation on the survey including how to administer the questionnaire
were conducted for the data collectors using webinar.

Before handing out the questionnaires to the potential study participants in the selected hospitals,
the data collectors introduced themselves to the respondents, build a rapport with them and
explained the aims of the study and data collection procedures. After obtaining consent from the
participants, the questionnaires were handed out to the respondents and appointed for return to
recollect the completed questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed with a cover letter
(consent form), introducing the study and explaining the purpose of the survey, instructions on
how to complete the questionnaire, and researchers contact information for any questions the
respondent might have. Participants completed the questionnaires by themselves in English
language. Data collection took place concurrently in all hospitals. Upon return of the
questionnaires, the data collectors checked for completeness and consistency, and incomplete
questionnaires were taken back to the respondents for completion as much as possible.

Statistical analyses
Before data entry, each questionnaire was checked for completeness. Data were entered into the
Census Surveys Professional (CSPro) Version 7.2 statistical software package and subsequently
exported to SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., IBM, USA) for cleaning and data analysis. Continuous
data were summarized using means and standard deviations, while categorical data were presented
as frequency counts and percentages. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the study
variables. The Chi-square test was used to assess the association between the groups.

The overall satisfaction score regarding the availability and use of PPE for each respondent was
calculated by taking the sum of the scores of the four questions. Responses to these questions were
summed to form a total satisfaction score ranging from 4 to 20, with higher scores indicating higher
level of satisfaction. Using the total satisfaction score, individuals were classified into two groups:
dissatisfied (≤ median score) and satisfied (>median score). The reliability of the questionnaire
was measured by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, and the Cronbach’s alpha for the satisfaction level
was 0.769. A bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed to identify the
main factors associated with healthcare professional’s satisfaction level regarding availability and
use of PPE. Individuals were classified into two based on their satisfaction level: satisfied group
(1), and the rest were placed in the dissatisfied group (0). Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were used to quantify the associations between potential predictors and
outcome variable, satisfaction level. A value of P<0.05 was used for all tests of statistical
significance.

Ethical considerations
Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the College
of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University (AAU). Permission to undertake this study was
obtained from every relevant authority at all levels. Official letters from AAU were written to each
hospital to cooperate and participate in the survey. All participants gave their informed consent
prior to data collection. Anonymity and data confidentiality were ensured, and no identifiable data
from individual participants were collected. All personnel involved in the survey received
orientation on COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures.

Results
Sample characteristics
From a total of 1,228 questionnaires distributed in six hospitals, 1,146 were completed and
returned. Of these, 12 questionnaires were discarded due to missing data, resulting in 1,134 (92%)
valid questionnaires for analysis. About 53% were females. Among the respondents reporting age,
the mean (±SD) age was 30.3 ±6.4 years, about 58% aged between 20-29 years, and 32% aged 3039 years (Table 1). The largest number of respondents were from TASH (25%, n=283) and
SPHMMC (20.5%, n=233), followed by ZMH (15.6%, n=177) and MH (15.3%, n=174). Nurses
constituted about 40% of the overall study participants, followed by physicians (22.2%), interns
(10.8%) and midwives (10.3%). Among 252 physicians (22.2%) participated in the study, GPs and
resident doctors accounted for 44.8% and 42.9%, respectively, while specialists and sub-specialists
consisted the remaining 12.3%. With Gyn&Ob department constituting 17.2% of the respondents,
surgical (13.9%), pediatrics (13.1%), medical (13.0%) and OPD (10.5%) departments represented
a fairly similar number of study participants. Among the study participants reporting work
experience, about 49% and 25% of the respondents reported that they served in the hospital less
than 5 years and 5-9 years, respectively. However, the majority of the respondents (67%) at
SPHMMC only served less than five years as compared to 28.3% of their counterparts at TASH.

Availability of PPE before and during COVID-19
The HCPs were asked the types of PPE that were frequently available in the hospital before and
after the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 2 shows the self-reported availability of different PPE by
HCPs before and during the COVID-19. Gloves and gowns were reported as the most frequently
available PPE in the routine care of patients before and during the pandemic. During the COVID19 pandemic, the frequent availability of most PPE as reported by the study participants has
improved, for example, the frequent availability of surgical facemask and N95 respirator has
increased from 59.3% and 12.6% before the pandemic to 82.6% and 24.2% after the pandemic,
respectively. The self-reported availability of gloves before and during COVID-19 was >90%, and
statistically not significant for any of the hospitals. The availability of gowns for all study hospitals
was >60% before and during the COVID-19, with no significant increase during the COVID-19.

The availability of facemask and N95 respirator showed a statistically significant increase during
COVID-19 as compared to the pre-COVID-19 (P<0.001). Similarly, the use of eye protection
(goggles and face shield) has increased from 18.6% before the pandemic to 27.1% during the
pandemic (P<0.001), but only a steady increase was observed in the availability of hair covers
during the pandemic as compared with the time before COVID-19 (P=0.240). This study found a
major variation among the study hospitals with regard to the frequently available PPE before and
after COVID-19. The frequent availability of N95 respirator during the pandemic was reported by

36% of the participants from SPHMMC and 30% from TASH as compared with 9.2% at MH and
13% at GMH. Even simple hand sanitizer was in short supply in some hospitals as reported by
some respondents.

Use of PPE before and during COVID-19
The HCPs were asked the types of PPE that were frequently used in the hospital before and after
the COVID-19 pandemic. Table 3 presents the self-reported frequently used PPE by HCPss before
and during COVID-19. Gloves and gowns were identified as the most frequently used PPE in the
hospital before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of gloves by all HCPs was above
90%, while the self-reported use by other healthcare workers before and after COVID-19 was
relatively lower than others, despite showing some improvement during COVID-19. Likewise, the
self-reported use of gowns remained not statistically significant before and during COVID-19,
whereas its use rate remained less than 80% for the different categories of HCPs. The use of
surgical facemask has increased from 47.2% before the pandemic to 85.7% during the pandemic
for all HCPs (P<0.001).

The use of N95 respirator has also increased from 9.1% before the pandemic to 21.2% after the
pandemic (P<0.001). Similarly, the use of eye protection (goggles and face shield) has increased
from 11.6% before the pandemic to 22.4% during the pandemic (P<0.001). A statistically
significant increase in the percentage of respondents reporting the frequent use of hair covers
during the pandemic as compared with the time before COVID-19 was also reported (P=0.008).
The self-reported use of N95 respirator was the highest for physicians than other even before (16%)
and after (23%) COVID-19, while the least use of N95 respirator was reported by interns. Overall,
the self-reported use of N95 respirator was lower than other PPE except the use of hair cover.
Although there was an increase in the self-reported use of hair cover during COVID-19, its use

was generally very low and the difference was not statistically significant regarding its use by the
different categories of HCPs.

With regard to the types of PPE used during their last interaction with a patient, the majority of
the HCPs reported the use of gloves (91.2%), gowns (72.4%), and facemasks (86.8%), with about
24%, 19% and 18% reporting N95 respirator, eye protection and hair dresses, respectively (Table

About 28% (n=294) and 27% (n=291) of all the respondents self-reported that they were
dissatisfied or strongly dissatisfied, respectively, about the availability of the correct PPE in their
hospital, as recommended by WHO, for managing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients

Generally, more than half of the different healthcare professional categories reported that they
disagreed or strongly disagreed about the statement on the availability of correct PPE in the
hospital for managing COVID-19 patients as per the WHO recommendation, ranging from about
51% by physicians and 66% by interns. About 54% and 17.5% of the respondents reported that
they were unsatisfied or somewhat unsatisfied with the availability of PPE, respectively. The
overwhelming majority of interns (76.8%), physicians (72.3%) and nurses (72.9%) were
unsatisfied with the current availability of PPE in the study hospitals. Only 10% of the respondents
expressed their opinion that they were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with the current availability
of PPE at their hospitals.

This study also assessed the level of preparedness of HCPs to provide direct clinical care to
COVID-19 patients. Only 5.2% and 32.8% of the participants felt they were completely prepared
or somewhat prepared to provide direct clinical care to COVID-19 patients, respectively. Overall,
the majority (77%, n=872/1134) of the participants perceived that the PPE currently available to
them at their hospital was inadequate to keep them safe from infection when managing suspected
or confirmed COVID-19 patients. The mean and the SD of the satisfaction scores of the four items
regarding the availability and use of PPE were calculated. Table 6 shows the degree of satisfaction
scores of all respondents. The first two items had a score of <2 (1.85±1.13 and 1.97±1.13),
indicating strong dissatisfaction of the HCPs, while the remaining two items had a mean score of
between 1.5 and 2.0 (2.65±1.40 and 2.70±1.39), showing the dissatisfaction of the study
participants. The overall score was 2.29±0.97, showing that the majority of the respondents

Overall

Bivariate and multivariable analyses of PPE self-reported satisfaction
The total satisfaction score regarding the availability and use of PPE for each respondent was used
as dependent variable and dichotomized into two groups: dissatisfied (≤median score) and satisfied
(>median score). This dependent variable was further subjected to bivariate and multivariable
binary logistic regression analyses using eight potential independent variables (gender, medical
profession, working unit, hospital, whether received training in PPE during the COVID-19
pandemic, whether used any ‘homemade’ or ‘creative’ PPE during COVID-19, whether they
reported that adequate PPE was available to protect them from risk of infection while managing
suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients, and preparedness to tackle COVID-19).

Table 7 shows the relationship between the respondents PPE satisfaction level and independent
factors for both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. In the bivariate logistic
regression, the odds of satisfaction with the availability of PPE among males were 1.37 times
higher than females (OR=1.37, 95% CI:1.08-1.75, P=0.010). However, nurses were less likely to
be satisfied with the availability and use of PPE than physicians (OR=0.48, 95% CI:0.29-0.77,
P=0.003). The HCPs at MH were less likely to be satisfied with the availability and use of PPE in

In the multivariable logistic regression analysis (Table 7), which was performed using eight
independent variables in the model, the odds of satisfaction with availability of PPE among males
were again 1.39 times higher than female healthcare workers (OR=1.39, 95% CI:1.05-1.85,
P=0.023). The odds of satisfaction among HCPs from GMH were 1.69 times higher than among
those working at SPHMMC (OR=1.69, 95% CI:1.05-2.71, P=0.031), while healthcare workers at
MH were less likely to be satisfied with PPE than those at SPHMMC (OR=0.45, 95% CI:0.280.72, P=0.001). The odds of satisfaction among those healthcare workers who reported that PPE
was adequately available to protect themselves from the risk of infection when managing suspected
or confirmed COVID-19 cases were 7.53 times higher than among those who reported inadequate
PPE (OR=7.53, 95% CI:5.08-11.16, P<0.001). The odds of satisfaction among HCPs who reported
that they were prepared to provide direct care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases were
higher than other healthcare workers (OR=1.65, 95% CI:1.22-2.12, P=0.001). The factors such as
medical profession, medical unit, training in PPE after COVID-19, and use of any ‘homemade’,
or ‘creative’ PPE in the hospital did not have significant influence on the satisfaction level of HCPs
regarding the availability and use of PPE. The multivariable binary logistic regression model
presented in Table 7 had goodness-of-fit under the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (2=5.35, P=0.720),
and the full model containing all predictors was statistically significant 2 (21, N=1067) = 231.56,
P<0.001. The model as a whole explained between 19.5% (Cox-Snell R2) and 26% (Nagelkerke
R2) of the variance in satisfaction level.

Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the availability and use of PPE among 1,134 HCPs working in six
public hospitals during the early stage of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Our findings
showed limited access to appropriate and sufficient PPE to health workers in the care of COVID24

19 and non-COVID-19 patients before and after COVID-19. Shortages of appropriate PPE for
HCPs irrespective of the hospitals they were serving is observed. This raises a concern regarding
the availability and use of proper PPE in the hospitals and the challenges of healthcare workers to
combat COVID-19 infection. Despite these concerns, the HCPs continue to work during COVID19. Though there is a global shortage, HCPs must be equipped with appropriate PPE that they need
to practice their clinical role with confidence. Shortage of healthcare workers is already significant
amidst the national effort against COVID-19. In the previous studies, inadequate personal
protection during the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, proximity to
patients infected by the virus and prolonged exposure to the infected environment were cited as
reasons for the health care workers becoming infected with the virus [16,17].

Lack of appropriate PPE itself can put the HCPs at risk of contracting the virus and infecting other
healthcare workers and their family. Although this problem did not only exist in Ethiopia, it was
also reported from China [18] and other countries. In one study in Jordan, only 18.5% of frontline
doctors reported that all PPE were available and most shortage was reported in protective
facemasks [19]. Several studies emphasized that adequate training, proper use and uninterrupted
availability of adequate PPE give HCPs a minimal risk of infection when treating suspected or
confirmed cases of COVID-19 [18,20,21]. A study in China found that of 420 doctors and nurses
deployed to frontline work at Wuhan hospitals between January and April 2020 none of them
contracted COVID-19 after receiving training in proper use of PPE and provided with appropriate
PPE [22]. A study from Hong Kong demonstrated that correct use of PPE by healthcare workers
was associated with no cases of infection over a 42-day observation period [23]. Studies have also
revealed that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is significantly higher particularly among frontline
HCPs with inadequate PPE caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients [24].

The shortage of PPE is particularly concerning for the commonly used N95 respirators. However,
recommendations are currently available to use surgical or medical masks when N95 is in short
supply. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that medical masks are not inferior
to N95 respirators for protecting healthcare workers against viral respiratory infections during
routine care and non–aerosol-generating procedures, but the researchers strongly recommended
preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures during COVID-19
when its supply is inadequate [25]. In response to the shortage of appropriate PPE, studies showed
that the scarcity could be mitigated through proper re-use or extended use techniques [26,27].

Evidence indicates that N95 respirators maintain their protection when used for extended periods
[28] although using them for longer than four hours is not recommended due to increased
discomfort [28,29]. The choice of PPE is also dependent on the level of protection provided by
PPE and the risk of exposure, thus understanding them is the key in choosing appropriate PPE
[30]. In this regard, the WHO IPC recommendations have proven to be an invaluable resource and
were quickly adopted and implemented in many countries in preparing their response to the
COVID-19 pandemic [31]. As a result, the WHO guidance on the rational use of PPE for COVID19 has provided appropriate criteria on how to select and use appropriate PPE in different settings
when PPE is in short supply [13].

The current study gives a first impression of the satisfaction level of HCPs with regard to the
availability and use of proper PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings show that the
HCPs had an overall low level of satisfaction with the availability and use of appropriate PPE in
their hospital. The healthcare system, which was already affected by the widespread shortage of

HCPs, will be further affected by the dissatisfied health workforce. Currently, there is limited
evidence on the satisfaction of healthcare workers about the availability and use of PPE. A recent
study conducted in Ethiopia reported that 75% of the healthcare workers in hospitals felt unsafe
about their work environment and only <30% reported that they had access to proper PPE in the
hospitals [32].

The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the satisfaction of HCPs regarding the
availability and use of PPE were affected by different factors, such as gender, hospital, perception
that PPE is adequately available, and preparedness to provide direct care to suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 cases. Male healthcare workers reported statistically significant higher satisfaction
level with PPE than female health workers. Among the healthcare workers, those who reported
that PPE was adequately available to protect themselves from the risk of infection when managing
COVID-19 patients rather than those who reported the inadequacy of PPE in their hospitals had
statistically significant level of higher satisfaction about PPE. As there is limited published
research on the relationship between healthcare workers satisfaction level with regard to the
availability and use of appropriate PPE and associated factors, this study contributes additional
knowledge in this area of research.

Finally, this study had some limitations. First, the study might be affected by selection bias.
Second, the study focused on more general populations of HCPs similar to other studies [33,34]
rather than healthcare workers who might have direct contact with COVID-19 patients [35].
Relying solely on respondents to determine the availability and use of PPE can introduce recall
bias. Lastly, the results of this study are based on a self-reported questionnaire using a crosssectional design, and the self-reported response might not represent actual or genuine answers.

Despite these limitations, the results obtained provide important information to guide the efforts
to avail appropriate PPE and optimize its use for effectively reducing the risk of COVID-19
infection among HCPs through implementing appropriate IPC measures.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this study has illuminated the level of the availability and use of PPE by HCPs
working at hospitals, and identified a critical shortage of appropriate PPE both before and during
COVID-19. The availability of N95 respirator was particularly insufficient, and the use of goggle
and gown were unsatisfactory, which might increase the risk of COVID-19 infection among HCPs.
The study shows that the HCPs had an overall low level of satisfaction with the current availability
and use of PPE in their hospital, which might potentially lead to a lower level of preparedness and
readiness among health workers to fight against COVID-19 infection. With the current critical
shortages of PPE in hospitals, the ongoing widespread COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia could
result in devastating consequences. The findings provide considerable insights into the importance
of urgent need and concerted efforts to adequately supply the healthcare facilities with appropriate
PPE to alleviate the current challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventing the risks of
COVID-19 infection among HCPs through providing proper and adequate PPE should be
strengthened and needs to be a top priority for Ministry of Health and the Government of Ethiopia.
