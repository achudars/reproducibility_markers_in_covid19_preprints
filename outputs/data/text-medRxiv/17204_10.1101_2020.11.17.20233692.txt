Abstract
Background and Purpose: The epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
affected health care systems globally. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of the
COVID-19 epidemic on hospital admissions for stroke in Japan.
Methods: We analyzed administrative (Diagnosis Procedure Combination) data for cases of
inpatients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with stroke (ischemic stroke, transient
ischemic attack (TIA), hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)) and
discharged from hospital during the period July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020. The number of
patients with each stroke diagnosis, various patient characteristics, and treatment approaches
were compared before and after the epidemic. Changes in the trend of the monthly number of
inpatients with each stroke diagnosis were assessed using interrupted time-series analyses.
Results: A total of 111,922 cases (ischemic stroke: 74,897 cases; TIA: 5,374 cases;
hemorrhagic stroke: 24,779 cases; SAH: 6,872 cases) in 253 hospitals were included. The
number of cases for all types of stroke decreased (ischemic stroke: -13.9%; TIA: -21.4%;
hemorrhagic stroke: -9.9%; SAH: -15.2%) in April and May 2020, compared to the number
of cases in 2019. Ischemic stroke and TIA cases, especially mild cases (modified Rankin
Scale = 0), decreased, with a statistically significant change in trend between the before- and
after-epidemic periods.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first recognized in Wuhan, China, in early
December 2019[1], spread globally in 2020. In Japan, the daily number of new COVID-19
infections increased dramatically from late March and April 2020[2]. In response, the
Japanese government declared a state of emergency on April 7 for seven prefectures and
broadened the declaration to all 47 prefectures on April 16[3].

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of disability in the world[4].
Treatments for stroke, especially intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular intervention for
ischemic stroke, are time-sensitive and should be initiated as quickly as possible[5].
Therefore, patients with symptoms suggesting stroke should be evaluated by medical staff
immediately. However, movement restrictions and the fear of COVID-19 transmission in
hospitals during the COVID-19 epidemic may lead to a hesitation by individuals to seek
medical services, resulting in delayed access and a higher risk of severe illness[6-7].
Although previous studies have shown a decline in hospital admissions for stroke during the
COVID-19 epidemic[8–11], most of these studies were conducted in a single center or in
relatively few centers. In contrast, we performed a retrospective cohort study using a
large-scale Japanese database. Our study sought to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the
impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on hospital admissions for stroke in Japan.

Methods
Data source
For this retrospective cohort study, we extracted Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC)
data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database for inpatients with a date
of discharge between July 1, 2018 and June 30, 2020. The QIP database is administered by
the Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Kyoto University[12],
which regularly collects DPC data from acute care hospitals in Japan which voluntarily
participate in the project. Over 500 hospitals participate in QIP, covering virtually all of
Japan. These hospitals include both public and private facilities of various sizes. In 2019, the
number of beds at the participating hospitals ranged from 30 to 1,151 (excluding psychiatric,
infectious diseases, and tuberculosis beds according to the Japanese classification of hospital
beds). The DPC/per-diem payment system (PDPS) is a Japanese prospective payment system
applied to acute care hospitals. In 2018, a total of 1,730 hospitals were using the DPC/PDPS,
accounting for 54% (482,618 of 891,872) of all the general hospital beds in Japanese
hospitals[13-14]. The DPC data consist of claims and discharge summaries, including
International Classification of Diseases and Related Health problems 10th Revision (ICD-10)
codes classifying the main diagnosis, the cause of hospital admission, the most and
second-most medical-resource-intensive diagnoses, up to 10 comorbidities, and 10
complications during hospitalization[15]. The database also includes the following patient

details: age, sex, medical procedures, daily records of drug administration, modified Rankin
Scale (mRS) before hospital admission and at discharge.

Study population
We selected cases in which patients aged 18 years and older were hospitalized due to stroke
and were discharged between July 1, 2018, and June 30, 2020. Ischemic stroke, transient
ischemic attack (TIA), hemorrhagic stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were
identified by ICD-10 code I63.x, G45.x other than G454, I60.x and I61.x, respectively, as the
diagnoses that caused the hospital admission.

Statistical Analysis
We began with a descriptive analysis. In order to make year-on-year comparisons, we
divided the study population into two groups: those who were admitted and discharged from
July 2018 to June 2019 and those who were admitted from July 2019 to June 2020. Because
the DPC data were coded on the day of discharge, the data for patients who were not
discharged by the end of June 2020 were not available, even though their dates of hospital
admissions were before June 30, 2020. Thus, both one-year datasets included inpatient cases
that started and ended during the corresponding period. We assessed the monthly ratio of
cases with each type of stroke between the two groups. In addition, we compared inpatient

cases for each diagnosis, patient characteristics, and time-sensitive treatment approaches
(intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular intervention) for the months of April and May in
2019 and 2020. We chose this period to compare the effect of the COVID-19 epidemic
because the state of emergency was lifted on May 25, 2020, in response to the decrease of
new confirmed COVID-19 cases. Continuous variables (such as age) are expressed as median
values [interquartile range]. Comparisons of the continuous variables for the two groups were
performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data (such as sex) were compared
using the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

An interrupted time series analysis (ITS) was performed to evaluate the effect of the
COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly rate of stroke hospitalizations[16]. We statistically
tested the changes in the number of admissions based on the date of discharge, after adjusting
for seasonality using a Fourier term. We compared the number of admissions per month
based on the date of discharge, not the date of admission, in our ITS analyses because, as
previously noted, the DPC data were generated after the patient’s discharge from the
hospitals. We hypothesized that COVID-19 would impact the admissions volume
immediately after April 2020, since the Japanese government had declared the state of
emergency and requested self-quarantine and social distancing on April 7, 2020, in response

Results
A total of 111,922 cases (ischemic stroke: 74,897 cases; TIA: 5,374 cases; hemorrhagic
stroke: 24,779 cases; SAH: 6,872 cases) in 253 hospitals were included. Among these,
102,685 cases (51,453 and 51,232 cases for the previous and the second years, respectively)
were used for year-over-year comparisons (Figure 1). For all types of stroke, the number of
cases decreased in April 2020 compared with April 2019 (Figure 2). Monthly numbers of
cases and year-over-year ratios for each type of stroke are displayed in Supplemental Table 1.
The total number of inpatient cases with each stroke diagnosis, characteristics, and
time-sensitive treatment approaches in April and May 2019 and 2020 are described in Tables
1 and 2.

Cases of all types of stroke in April and May 2020 decreased compared with those in 2019
(Ischemic stroke: -13.9%, TIA: -21.4%, Hemorrhagic stroke: -9.9%, SAH: -15.2%). A
comparison of the proportion of cases receiving intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular
intervention for ischemic stroke remained at the same level (p = 0.2474, p = 0.8773)

The ITS analyses indicated that the COVID-19 epidemic had a negative impact on the
number of hospitalizations due to ischemic stroke and TIA (p < 0.05) (Figure 3). The
analyses for ischemic stroke and TIA using the mRS indicated that only the number of
inpatients with mRS 0 had been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic. (Table 3)

Discussion
In this study, we used a large-scale administrative database to show that the number of
inpatients due to all types of stroke decreased during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. The
ITS analyses identified statistically significant decreases in hospitalizations for ischemic
stroke and TIA, especially for mild cases in which the mRS scores were 0.

The significant decrease in the number of inpatient cases due to ischemic stroke and TIA is
consistent with previous reports[17]. In other fields, including pediatrics and cardiology,
patients were found to be reluctant to seek medical evaluation for fear of exposure to
COVID-19 in hospital[7,18]. Similarly, patients of stroke, especially those without severe
symptoms such as headaches or paralysis, may be hesitant to seek medical services. Another

possible explanation for the decrease in the number of inpatients is the lack of contact with
others resulting from stay-at home and social distancing practices. In cases of acute stroke, it
is not uncommon for friends and neighbors to request emergency help[19] .

Even in emergency conditions such as the COVID-19 epidemic, appropriate evaluation and
management of stroke is necessary. Any delay in the medical evaluation of even mild cases
may result in severe consequences, including long-term disability, pneumonia due to
dysphagia, and the early recurrence of stroke. For example, dual antiplatelet therapy within
24 hours of the onset of symptoms decreases the risk of recurrent stroke and death in patients
with high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke[20]. In the future, healthcare organizations and
providers need to recognize that stroke patients with mild symptoms may be reluctant to seek
medical evaluation during an epidemic, particularly where “social distancing” and
“stay-at-home” practices are being recommended. Those with symptoms suggesting stroke
should be encouraged to seek appropriate medical evaluation immediately, even if the
symptoms are mild and temporary.

Our study has several limitations. First, the study population was restricted to cases in
hospitals that voluntarily participate in the QIP. The movement of patients to other,
non-participating facilities during the COVID-19 epidemic might lead to an overestimate of

the impact of the epidemic. However, in the case of hemorrhagic stroke and SAH, the
relatively constant trends of hospitalization identified in the study suggest the absence of
large-scale movement to other hospitals. It also suggests a lack of significant restrictions on
the acceptance of stroke patients by participating hospitals. Second, our DPC data did not
include details of the stroke onset time. Consequently, the period of time from symptom onset
to hospital arrival was not assessed. Finally, our research included only cases in Japan. Given
the differences in healthcare systems and the patterns of the COVID-19 epidemic between
countries, it is difficult to judge whether our results can be applied elsewhere. Despite these
limitations, our research provides important information on the impact of the COVID-19
epidemic on stroke patients and the facilities caring for them.

Conclusion

We showed a marked reduction in hospital admissions due to stroke during the COVID-19
epidemic in Japan using large-scale administrative data. In particular, our ITS analyses
identified a significant reduction in admissions for ischemic stroke and TIA, especially in
mild cases.
