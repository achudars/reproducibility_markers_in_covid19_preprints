Background. We investigated a likely scenario of COVID-19 spreading in Brazil through
the complex airport network of the country, for the 90 days after the ﬁrst national

occurrence of the disease. After the conﬁrmation of the ﬁrst imported cases, the lack of a
proper airport entrance control resulted in the infection spreading in a manner directly

proportional to the amount of ﬂights reaching each city, following ﬁrst occurrence of the
virus coming from abroad. Methodology. We developed a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-

Recovered) model divided in a metapopulation structure, where cities with airports were

demes connected by the number of ﬂights. Subsequently, we further explored the role of

Manaus airport for a rapid entrance of the pandemic into indigenous territories situated in
remote places of the Amazon region. Results. The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

between cities was fast, directly proportional to the airport closeness centrality within the
Brazilian air transportation network. There was a clear pattern in the expansion of the

pandemic, with a stiﬀ exponential expansion of cases for all cities. The more an airport
showed closeness centrality, the greater was its vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusions. We discussed the weak pandemic control performance of Brazil in

comparison with other tropical, developing countries, namely India and Nigeria. Finally, we

proposed measures for containing virus spreading taking into consideration the scenario of
high poverty.

In the last few weeks, the new disease COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around
the world mainly due to stealth transmission, which started in China at the end of 2019.
Large continental countries are likely to be very vulnerable to the occurrence of
pandemics (Morse et al. 2012). While the dissemination dynamics have varied between
regions, country sanitary policies play a key role in it. For instance, two very large
developing countries, India and Brazil, have a very different epidemical pattern. On
March 18th, India had 137 cases and Brazil 621, as recorded in the Brazilian Ministry of
Health and John Hopkins monitoring sites dedicated to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.
From 17th to 18th March, Brazil had an increase of 31% in one day, with only four
capitals exhibiting community transmission, which was the same to India. However, a
very distinct pattern in the ascending starting point for the reported disease exponential
curve was observed in each country. By enlarging the comparison to another
developing tropical country in the Southern Hemisphere (thus in the same season), we

selected Nigeria, since it was the first country to detect a COVID-19 case in Africa.
Nigeria displayed less than 10 confirmed cases during the same period of time.
Furthermore, Nigeria has a population (206 million) similar to that of Brazil (209 million).
Both India and Nigeria claim they imposed severe entrance control, and close
following up of each confirmed case, as well as their living and working area, and
people in contact with them. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health has developed a good
monitoring network and a comprehensive preparation of the health system for the worstcase scenario. Nonetheless, apparently, the decisions from the Ministry of Health did
not cover airport control, and only on March 19th, eventually too late, the government
decided to control the airports, avoiding the entrance of people coming from Europe or
Asia. Hence, the entrance of diseased people in Brazil has been occurring with no
control, at least until the aforementioned date. Moreover, after confirming that a person
is infected with SARS-CoV-2, his/her monitoring is initiated but there is no monitoring of
his/her living network.
For pandemic situations, such as that with which we are living with SARS-CoV-2,
the classical algebraic ecological models of species population growth from Verhulst,
and species interaction models from Lotka-Volterra, are theoretical frameworks capable
to describe the phenomenon and to propose actions to stop it (Pianka 2000). In many
aspects social isolation is a way to severely reduce carrying capacity, i.e., the resources
available for the virus dissemination. This is the best action for within-city pandemic
spreading of coronavirus (Hellewell et al. 2020), since the main form of transmission is
direct contact between people or by contact with fomite, mainly in closed environments,
such as classrooms, offices, etc. (Rothe et al., 2019; Bedford et al., 2020). Regardless
of virulence, for a highly contagious virus such as SARS-CoV-2, the occurrence of the
first case in a nation will result in a strongly and nearly uncontrollable exponential
growth curve, depending only on the number of encounters between infected and
susceptible people, and fuelled by a high H0 (the number of people one infected person
will infect).
On the other hand, the dynamics of disease spreading among cities are entirely
distinct. In this work, we present an epidemiological model describing the free entrance
of people coming from two highly infected countries with close links to Brazil: Italy and
Spain. We showed how SARS-CoV-2 spreads into the Brazilian cities by the
international airports, and then to other, less internationally connected cities, through
the Brazilian airport network. For exploring the dynamics of a continent size, nationwide
spreading of SARS-CoV-2, as it is the case of Brazil, we assumed cities connected by
airports formed a metapopulation structure.
Each person in a city was taken as a component of a superorganism, i.e., an
interdependent entity where living individuals are not biologically independent between
them in various subtle ways. By doing so, we dealt with cities as the sampling units, not
the people. Flights coming from foreign countries with COVID-19 (namely Spain and

city. Additionally, we also further explored the vulnerability of the Amazon region,
especially of those remote towns where indigenous and traditional communities
predominate.

In order to describe the pattern of air transportation and its role in the spreading of the
disease, we built a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model (Hethcote 1989;
Anderson 1991) split amongst the cities that are interconnected by flights. In this model,
the population size inside each city is irrelevant, as well as when the collective infection
stage was reached. Thus, we assumed that the city was fully infected and became
infectious to the whole system, and, therefore, became a source and not a sink of
infection events. Hence, the SIR model started having cities with only susceptible
events. Infected events only appeared by migration, i.e. travelers only from Italy and
Spain, for sake of simplicity and proximity to the facts.
After the first occurrence is registered in the country, infected events started to
spread through the national airlines.
We used a modified version of the SIR model, which took into account the
topology of how the cities-demes were linked by domestic flights. In the SIR original
model, the infection of susceptible cities occurs by probability β of a healthy being (S)
encounters an infected one (I). Conversely, the model has a probability of an infected
one get recovered (R) given by a parameter γ. Analytically:
𝛽
𝑆𝑡 + 1 = 𝑆𝑡 ‒ 𝑆𝑡𝐼𝑡
𝑁

𝛽
𝐼𝑡 + 1 = 𝐼𝑡 + 𝑆𝑡𝐼𝑡 ‒ 𝛾𝐼𝑡
𝑁

𝑅𝑡 + 1 = 𝑅𝑡 + 𝛾𝐼𝑡

where the indexes t and t+1 represent the present time and the next time, respectively,
and N=S+I+R is the total constant population. In this work, we proposed two
modifications of the SIR model. The first one is related to the fact that we considered all
Brazilian cities that have an airport. Thus, we had Si, Ii, and Ri where i was a given city.
In our case study, 1≤i≤154. Another important modification was that related to the
connections among airports or cities. Using ANAC data, it was possible to track all the
domestic flights in Brazil (Figure 1): https://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/dados-eestatisticas/historico-de-voos

The modified version of SIR model is then described as follows:
𝛽
𝑆𝑡 +𝑖 1 = 𝑆𝑡𝑖 ‒ 𝑆𝑡𝑖(𝐼𝑡𝑖 + 𝐼𝑡𝑖)
𝑁

𝛽
𝐼𝑡 +𝑖 1 = 𝐼𝑡𝑖 + 𝑆𝑡𝑖(𝐼𝑡𝑖 + 𝐼𝑡𝑖) ‒ 𝛾(𝐼𝑡𝑖 + 𝐼𝑡𝑖)
𝑁

𝑅𝑡 +𝑖 1 = 𝑅𝑡𝑖 + 𝛾(𝐼𝑡𝑖 + 𝐼𝑡𝑖),

where the upper index i indicates the city, and t the time. The term 𝐼𝑡𝑖 represents the

infection added to the ith city due to traveling diseases, and it is calculated as follow:
154
𝑖
𝐼𝑡 = 𝛼
𝑘𝑖,𝑗𝐼𝑗
𝑗=0

∑

where ki,j is the number of flights departing at city i and arriving at city j, and α is a newly
introduced parameter, which represents the fraction of traveling infected population. For
the time, we estimated 90 days for the disease expansion and assumed γ as 0, in other
words, no recovery. Despite the artificiality of this assumption, we considered that the
amount of people still to be infected is larger than those recovered and, thus, becoming
resistant, which makes the resistance irrelevant to our output. The model was
developed in C and is available as Supplementary Material 1 (and the database as
Supplementary Material 2). In addition, we also used a linear model to test whether
those cities with higher airport closeness centrality (i.e., important cities for connecting
different cities within the Brazilian air transportation network) were more vulnerable to
SARS-CoV-2 dissemination.

The expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus between cities was fast, directly proportional to
the airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network. The
disease spread from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to the next node-city by the flight
network, and in 90 days virtually all the cities with airport(s) were reached, although it
occurred with a distinct intensity (Figure 2, Supplementary Material 3). There was a
clear pattern in the expansion of the pandemic, with a stiff exponential expansion of
cases (measured as the cumulative percentage of infected people per city) for all the
cities. On average, the model showed an ascendant curve starting at day 50 (around 15
April), with the most connected cities starting their ascendant curve just after 25 days,
and the most isolated ones from day 75 (10th May; Figure 3A). Looking at the daily

increment rates, it is clear a first and high peak of infections in the hub cities, happening
around 50 days and, starting from 75 days, a new peripheric peak (Figure 3B).
The first ten cities to ascend infection rates (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador,
Recife, Brasília, Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, and Florianópolis) will
actually reach this point about the same time, which is a concerning pattern for the
saturation of the public health services. Also, this peak in those cities will saturate all the
best hospitals in the country simultaneously.
Therefore, we defined the average proportion of infected people for the 90 days
as a measure of vulnerability to COVID-19 dissemination. Henceforth, we found that
more an airport shows closeness centrality within the air transportation network, the
greater was its vulnerability to disease transmission (Figure 4). This scenario confirmed
the importance of a city connecting different cities within the Brazilian air transportation
network and, thus, acting as the main driver for the pandemic spreading across the
country.
Consequences for the Amazonian cities and indigenous people
Herein we showed that an uncontrolled complex airport system made a whole
country vulnerable in few weeks, allowing the virus to reach the most distant and remote
places, in the most pessimistic scenario. According to our model, any connected city will
be infected after three months. As the number of flights arriving in a city is the driver for
the proportion of infected people, Manaus, which is a relevant regional clustering, was
infected sooner. Indeed, on the 17th of March, Manaus was the first Amazonian city with
confirmed cases (without community transmission yet), and it is a node that is one or
two steps to all the Amazonian cities. Thus, according to our model, Manaus may reach
1% of the infected population by the 44th day, while, for instance, the far west
Amazonian Tabatinga will take 61 days to reach the same 1% of the population
infected. By day 60, Manaus may have an average of 50% of its population infected if
nothing is be done to prevent it. Tabatinga may also reach the aforementioned value by
day 78, if nothing is be done to avoid it. To sum up, within 46 days all the Amazonian
cities will have 1% of their population infected and a mean of 50% by day 70.

Brazil has failed to contain COVID-19 in airports and failed to closely monitor those
infected people coming from abroad, as well as their living network. One main reason
for this is the difficult logistics required to produce such control in a continental country,
such as Brazil, which has a complex national flight network. According to the Brazilian
Airport Authority, Brazil has the second-largest flight network in the world (just after the
USA), with a total of 154 airports registered to commercial flights of which 31 are
considered international. In comparison, airport control may be much easier to set up in
Nigeria (31 airports of which only five are international). However, with a population 6.4

times higher than Brazil, India, in turn, has a similar sized airport network to Brazil,
harboring a total of 123 airports of which 34 are considered international.
Nevertheless, the situation of COVID-19 in India is currently much milder than in
Brazil, and it is hard to blame the complexity of the airport networks for the contrasting
exponential curve of these two countries. In 20 days from the first infection in Brazil
(February 26th) against 47 days after the first Indian case (January 30th), Brazil already
had 5.4 more confirmed cases than India. Clearly one country is doing much better in
preventing the entrance of cases and the spreading of the disease by controlling
infected citizens. Considering the high probability of a synchronizing SARS-Cov-2 high
spreading in various capitals, the country may face a quick health service collapse.
Besides the within-city pattern of virus spreading, one must take into account the
pattern of dispersion between cities after the virus has invaded. Additionally, for the
Brazilian case, one cannot ignore that, eventually, the occurrence of the first case may
have occurred nearly one month before official records, during the carnival period. This
is the largest popular street party on the planet, with 6.4 million people in Rio de
Janeiro, and 16.3 million in Salvador where the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism revealed
that 86,000 foreigners from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, UK, and the US had visited.
Considering a disease with so many asymptomatic cases, it could have invaded before
but, with the lack of an early warning and airport control, one will never know exactly if
this happened. As airport control might have been even more lax in small airports, it
might unavoidably result in strengthening of the capability of an infected city to infect the
next new one, if no public policy is adopted.
Without a social isolation policy, virus propagation may result in chaotic
dynamics, sensu May (1976). The lack of control for these situations may result in a
dramatic rate of host infection, and an eventual collapse of the host-parasite interaction
in a given population, depending on the amount of susceptible, infected and recovered
events. Nonetheless, if the population is split into deme-cities, in a metapopulation
structure, the collapse takes longer, and a much greater amount of people in different
locations may eventually be infected, as found in our model. It is worthwhile to mention
that this model, already pessimistic, did not consider the road network, one of the
largest on the planet. Most importantly, the best road-connected cities are exactly those
mostly connected by airport, and that will be vulnerable earlier, thus, probably spreading
the disease faster than our model can predict, unless roads are soon blocked for
people. Another weakness of the model is that it cannot quantify a great number of
small airports not registered for commercial flights, very common in the Amazonian and
Western regions. Taking this into a global scale, for a highly interconnected human
population, the consequences may be catastrophic, as it was for the influenza pandemic
(Spanish flu) in 1918 (Ferguson et al. 2003). Furthermore, one aspect that must not be
neglected is the way as an increasing number of infected people in a city drive the
pandemic towards the next city or country. In this context, the complex and large flight

network of Brazil, which is also key for the whole Latin America, if not properly
monitored and controlled, may cause a window of opportunity for the virus to spread
over the entire continent.
The consequences of this uncontrolled SARS-Cov-2 spreading is particularly
serious if one takes into consideration the chances of a mutant virulent strain appearing
and spreading into poorer and little monitored places of the world. Specifically, for the
Amazon region, the lack of any control will make the city of Manaus a very sensitive
cluster for public health, due to predominantly poor and indigenous-dominated cities in
the region, which are connected to Manaus and will be rapidly infected. Reaching
isolated regions means reaching indigenous or traditional communities, whose
individuals are classically more susceptible to new pathogens than western-influenced
or mixed urban populations. Therefore, a way to prevent such spreading, if still there is
time, would be to deal with airports as entrances that need severe infection barriers.

The eventual lesson to take is that inflexible, severe, and easy to repeat
controlling protocols must be applied to all the cities with airports. Likewise, the followup monitoring of suspicious individuals and their living network should be reinforced as
a national strategy to prevent a large territory to be taken over by a pandemic in a short
period of time. In other words, internationally accepted procedures must be taken and
even be reviewed to adjust to complex national flight networks of any country. Such
procedures must be considered as a priority for national remote airports too, in order to
keep poorer and worse equipped cities away from a rapid spread of a pandemic
disease.
It is clear at this point that a fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 is a reality in Brazil,
and across most of the country. We proposed this model in order to emphasize the
fragility of Brazilian surveillance in the airport network, in an attempt to cause some
policy change in time to preserve at least the most remote regions, which are also the
most vulnerable, with a weaker health service. Moreover, most of the Eastern part of the
country must stay in social isolation in order to prevent a health public collapse by midApril, as the Ministry of Health predicted. In addition, we also could consider the
generalized poverty of Brazil as a further problem our model did not deal with. The
chances to produce home-to-home isolation, even legally imposed, is impossible for
these poor communities. Nonetheless, considering the few main entrances of most of
the Brazilian shanty towns and communities, a similar to airport entrance severe control
must be considered to protect a larger but closely connected set of people, eventually
following the protocols used for control of Ebola during the last epidemic in Africa (Lau
et al. 2017).

Figure 1 – Brazilian flight network, taken from ANAC database.
Figure 2 – Proportion of infected population of each Brazilian city in 40, 50, 70, and 90
days. Circle colour temperature represents a gradient in percentage of the infected
population. Circle size also reflects the size of the pandemics locally in the logarithm
scale.
Figure 3 – Proportion of infected people per cities until 90 days. A) Cumulative increment
rate. The blue line is the national average, and the shadow area is the summing up of
minimum and maximum values of all the cities per time interval; B) Daily increment rate.
The blue line is the average, showing the overall high rate of infection occurring from 50
to 80 days. Shadow shows the first and the highest peak in the hub cities, around 50
days, and, subsequently, a peripheric peak after 75 days.
Figure 4 – Airport closeness centrality within the Brazilian air transportation network,
and its effect on the vulnerability of each city (represented by the average of the
percentage of cases per city for the whole 90 days running: r2 = 0.71 p < 0.00001).
Supplementary Material 1 – Code description - SIR model under network topology.
The code was developed in C, and it works as a modification of SIR model running along with
the topology of the domestic flight network. After initiating all variables to an initial condition, that
is, S (health), I (infected) and R (recovered) of each city, the code starts loading the network
and calculates the total number of flights among all the cities. This information is used to feed
the classical SIR model introducing in the variable I, the information regarding infected travelers
and non-travelers, and the model calculates the next S, I and R of all the cities. This calculation
is done in a loop time representing days, the time step that the model was calibrated.

Supplementary Material 2 – ANAC database of aerial transportation network.
The spreadsheet presents all the 120 cities with airport(s), their state, latitude and
longitude, followed by the closeness centrality in the network. The columns t0 to t90 are
the times from 0 to 90 days. Lines for the time columns are the percentage of infected
people per city per time.
Supplementary Material 3 – Movie of the spreading of SARS-CoV-2.
This file has a short movie describing the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 dissemination
across Brazil, in two versions.
