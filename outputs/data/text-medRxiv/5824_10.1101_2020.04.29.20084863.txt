Abstract
Introduction

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestation, history of exposure, positive
findings on chest CT and laboratory tests. It has been shown that inflammation plays a role
in pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Method

We used the necessary transformations to convert the median and IQR to mean and SD
Random-effect model using Der Simonian, and Laird methods was used if heterogeneity
between studies was significant, the homogeneity among studies was assessed with
I2 Statistic, values above 50%, and for the chi-square test, P-values <0.1 was supposed
statistically significant

Results

Twelve studies were included in the analysis that all of which were conducted in China in
the year 2020. The result of combining 12 articles with 772 participants showed that the
pooled estimate of the mean of lymphocyte with 95% CI was (Mean: 1.01; 95% CI (0.761.26); p-value<0.001). About WBC the pooled result of 9 studies with 402 participants was
(Mean: 5.11; 95% CI (3.90-6.32); p-value<0.001) Also the pooled mean estimate of 9
studies with 513 patients for the ratio of Neutrophil/lymphocyte was (Mean: 3.62; 95% CI
(1.48-5.77); p-value=0.001). The pooled mean from the combination of 7 studies with 521
patients on CRP was (Mean: 28.75; 95% CI (8.04-49.46).

Introduction
A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen of pneumonia in Wuhan City,
Hubei province in China in December 2019 (1). It was subsequently named Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was named COVID-19
by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2). On 30th January 2020, the WHO declared
the Chinese outbreak of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern posing a high risk to countries with vulnerable health systems (3). To date many
countries in the world in different continents was involved in COVID-19 and its
complications and it became a pandemic disease.

Most patients with COVID-19 have developed mild symptoms such as dry cough, sore
throat, fatigue and fever. The majority of cases have spontaneously resolved. However,
some patients developed fatal complications such as organ failure, septic shock and Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and finally died (4).

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical manifestation, history of exposure, positive
findings on chest CT and laboratory tests (5). It has been shown that inflammation plays a
role in pathogenesis of COVID-19 (6). In these patients release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines followed by inflammasome activation produce lung injury (7).

Systemic inflammation changes the features of circulating blood cells have been suggested
to

be biomarkers for

assessment

of

inflammatory

activity. Neutrophilia with lymphopenia is a response of the innate immune system to
systemic inflammation. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is another inflammatory
marker, which is the proportion of absolute neutrophil count to lymphocytes on routine

complete blood count (CBC) tests. An elevated NLR is associated with the prognosis of
systemic inflammatory diseases, especially infectious diseases (8).

CRP as the most representative of acute phase reactants, is elevated in many respiratory
viral infections (9). CRP testing is used at the forefront for evaluation of infection and is
important for COVID-19 management (10).

In this meta-analysis, we decided to evaluate the White blood cell and lymphocyte count,
NLR and CRP titer in COVID-19 to use these findings in the diagnosis of the COVID-19
more rapidly and accurately.

Method
Literature search and selection criteria
We used Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement for Scoping Reviews”
(PRISMA-ScR)(11).
Pubmed, EMBASE and Scopus, were searched for eligible publications, till March 20,

investigators. Articles deemed potentially eligible were retrieved for full-text review. NonEnglish publications were translated by a native/fluent speaker.
Statistical methods

Two measures of association were used in studies; mean (SD) and median (IQR). We used
the necessary transformations to convert the median and IQR to mean and SD (12).
Therefore, the pooled estimation is reported based on mean and a corresponding 95% CI.
Random-effect model using Der Simonian and Laird methods was used if heterogeneity
between studies was significant, to Summary the results, otherwise a model with fixed
effect was calculated (13). The homogeneity among studies was assessed with I2 Statistic,
values above 50%, and for the chi-square test, P-values <0.1 was supposed statistically
significant (14). Publication bias was evaluated with Begg’s rank correlation tests and
Egger’s linear regression tests (15). If the test for Publication bias become significant, trim
and fill methods were used to modify the results. All analyses were performed using
STATA version 14.

Result
Figure.1 shows the search strategy result. Twelve studies were included in the analysis that
all of which were conducted in China in the year 2020. The age of patients varied from 40
to 75 years. Summary information of each article is presented in Table.1, As shown in
Table.2, The result of combining 12 articles with 772 participants showed that the pooled
estimate of the mean of lymphocyte with 95% CI was (Mean:1.01; 95% CI (0.76-1.26); pvalue<0.001, Figure.2). About WBC the pooled result of 9 studies with 402 participants
was (Mean: 5.11; 95% CI (3.90-6.32); p-value<0.001) (the forest plot is presented in
Figure.3). Also the pooled mean estimate of 9 studies with 513 patients for the ratio of

Neutrophil/lymphocyte was (Mean: 3.62; 95% CI (1.48-5.77); p-value=0.001, Figure.4).
The pooled mean from the combination of 7 studies with 521 patients on CRP was (Mean:
28.75; 95% CI (8.04-49.46); p-value<0.001, Figure.5. The heterogeneity test was not
significant for any of the outcomes (p-value>0.05), so all results were based on a fixed
model. Also the publication bias except for the WBC (p-value=0.026), for others were not
significant. The adjusted result of Trim and fill test to modify the result of WBC, was
(Mean: 4.97; 95% CI (3.81-6.13)).

Discussion
Several studies have suggested that increased amounts of cytokines in serum are associated
with pulmonary damage in SARS and MERS-CoV infection (16,17).

In this meta-analysis, we studied the inflammatory markers of CBC and lymphocyte upset
in patients with COVID-19. We included all epidemiological and case report studies. The
patients age was between 40 to 75 years.

The blood level of WBC was normal with reduced amount of lymphocyte, as expected
(18). In terms of laboratory tests, we noted that most of infected patients presented
lymphopenia and low counts of CD3+ cells and CD4+ cells have been observed in COVID19 cases (19). NLR is used as a marker of subclinical inflammation, especially in severe
pneumonia (20). Here we showed that the pool NLR of COVID-19 is 3.62 which is upper
than physiological range.

An increase of the NLR is common among patients with COVID-19, and especially in the
severe cases, COVID-19 damages lymphocytes and the immune system. It has been
suggested that NLR is the most significant factor affecting the severe illness incidence, and
it has significant predictive value (19).

Based on the previous studies, Patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia with higher NLR and
age would face a worse outcome which helps their risk stratification. If there are large-scale
cases, the risk stratification and management will help alleviate the shortage of medical
resources and reduce the mortality of critical patients.

In conclusion, in this study, we found that patients with COVID-19 have higher CRP and
NLR but low lymphocyte and normal WBC, which can help in diagnosis of these patients.
