Abstract
Background: COVID-19 has been recognized as an emerging and rapidly
evolving health condition. For this reason, efforts to determine changes in
laboratory parameters of COVID-19 patients as biomarkers are urgent. Lipids are
essential components of the human body, and their modulation has been observed
implicated in some viral infections.
Methods: To evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile changes in
Mexican COVID-19 patients, the lipid profile of one hundred two COVID-19 positive
patients from three hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa in northwest Mexico, was
analyzed. ROC curves and binary logistic regression analysis were used as a
predictive model to determine their clinical diagnostic utility.
Results: Significant changes in the serum lipid profile of patients with COVID-19,
such as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high triglycerides and VLDL
were observed. The same abnormalities in the lipid profile among non-critical and
critical COVID-19 patients were detected. The predictive model analysis suggests
that cholesterol and LDL have AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively, for
COVID-19 (p= 0.0002 and p= <0.0001), and LDL low levels might be a risk factor
for critical COVID-19 (OR= 2.07, 95% IC: 1.18 to 3.63; p= 0.01).
Conclusion: Our findings suggest that low cholesterol and LDL levels could be
considered an acceptable predictor for COVID-19, and low levels of LDL might be
a risk factor for critical COVID-19 patients.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of
international concern caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More than two hundred countries around the world
have reported more than 13 million confirmed cases, and more than half a million
deaths caused by COVID-191,2. The epidemiological information of the COVID-19
pandemic in Latin America indicates that as of June nearly four million cases and
more than two hundred thousand deaths have been reported3, while in Mexico,
311, 486 cases of COVID-19 and 36,327 deaths have been reported4,5. The
SARS-CoV-2 transmission was initially linked to a local exotic animal market in the
province of Wuhan, China, indicating a possible zoonosis 6. SARS-CoV-2 can be
transmitted human-to-human, through the inhalation of aerosols with nasal
discharge droplets, in addition to direct or indirect contact of the oral and nasal
mucous membranes and eye membranes with everyday contaminated objects

7–10

.

The symptoms of the disease may be mild (flu-like infection with fever, headache
or dry cough) or severe due to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), leading to acute breathing difficulties, respiratory failure,
multiple organ failure, or death of the patient

9–11

. Reports of patients with

associated morbidity, mainly diabetes (DM), hypertension (HT), and other
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, have been linked to poor prognosis
of the disease12–14.
Additionally, manifestations of hypolipidemia were reported in Chinese patients
with mild symptoms and progressively worsened according to the severity of the
disease15,16. The severity of the disease could be attributed to alterations in

cholesterol levels since mainly two groups of the population are more affected in
morbidity and mortality by COVID-1917–21. On the other hand, changes in serum
lipid profiles have been reported previously in other viral infections22–26, including
respiratory viral infections, where their potential as metabolic biomarkers to help
clinicians distinguish bacterial from viral infection in febrile patients has been
determined27. For these reasons, we found it interesting to explore whether
alterations in serum lipid levels in COVID-19 Mexican patients can be useful as
biomarkers of disease or severity. In this study, we analyzed the lipid profile of one
hundred two COVID-19 positive patients from 3 hospitals in Culiacan, Sinaloa, in
northwest Mexico, one of the states with the highest number of cases of the
disease in Mexico, and using a combination of ROC curves and logistic regression
analysis we evaluate the clinical diagnosis utility of the lipid profile in Mexican
COVID-19 patients.

1. Material and methods
2.1 Study design
A prospective and descriptive study was conducted at three different hospitals from
Culiacan, Sinaloa, in northwest Mexico, from April 16 to June 16, 2020.

All

patients included in this study met the diagnostic criteria according to national and
international guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19

27,28

, and the

SARS CoV-2 infection was confirmed by the real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) test. The information for all patients was obtained from electronic
medical record systems, except the lipid profile (total serum cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and VLDL).

The risk stratification was determined according to the symptoms and clinical signs
presented by the patients. In the mild disease with mild COVID-19, patients
suffered of fever, headache, cough, respiratory symptoms, or chest pain, while in
severe cases, patients have a respiratory rate (RR) ≥ 30 per minute or/and oxygen
saturation ≤ 93 %. Critical COVID-19 patients met severe case criteria plus the
need for mechanical ventilation, or/and had a shock or multiorgan failure

29

.

Additionally, to dichotomize the variables and calculate risks and diagnostic
accuracy, patients were divided into non-critical COVID-19 patients and critical
COVID-19 patients: non-critical COVID-19 patients were those patients classified
as mild or severe COVID-19 cases.

2.2 Serum Lipid Profile quantification
A fasting blood sample was taken from each participant at hospital admission to
determine the total serum cholesterol (n= 102), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (n=
94), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (n= 93), and triglycerides (n= 98) levels by
enzymatic method. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (n= 98) levels were
measured using Friedewald's methodology 30.

Additionally, the lipid profile data of a group of thirty healthy blood donors, who
were part of a previous pre-pandemic study [32], was used as healthy controls.
The control subjects were negative for a viral panel (anti-dengue IgM and IgG, HIV,
HCV antibodies) and belonged to the same geographic region. They had no
previous history of dyslipidemia or a history of cholesterol-lowering therapy.

The Research Ethical Committee of Hospital General de Culiacan "Bernardo J
Gastelum" approved the study, and some patients writing informed consent, and in
another, the consent was verbal.

2.3 Statistic analysis
The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges (IQR, 25-75th
percentile) to describe age, and mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to
describe the lipid profile. The parametric Unpaired t-test with Welch's correction
was used to compare the lipid profile means of total COVID-19 patients between
healthy controls, and the non-parametric U Mann Whitney test was used to
compare age and lipid profile median values among non-critical and critical
COVID-19 patients, using the GraphPad Prism software version 7. To determine if
changes in the serum lipid profile are useful to predict COVID-19 disease or
severity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curves
ROC (AUC) were calculated to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive (+LR)
and negative (-LR) likelihood ratios to each lipid in the lipid profile in predicting
COVID-19 disease and critical COVID-19. Moreover, binary logistic regression was
used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% IC) between
non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients based on the calculated optimal cut-off
points using the MedCalc software version 14. Statistical significance was set at p
< 0.05.

During the study period, clinical and lipid profile information was obtained from 102
COVID-19 patients. Their demographic data showed a median age of 57 years and
a higher frequency of male patients at hospital admission (Table 1). The patient
stratification was according to the risk, based on the clinic, as shown in Table 1.
Age differs significantly between non-critical and critical COVID-19 cases (p=
0.0095), and males were more frequent among non-critical and critical COVID-19
patients. About comorbidities, hypertension (HT), obesity, and diabetes (DM) were
the most frequent, especially in the critical COVID-19 group of patients (Table 1).

Regarding to the lipid profile in COVID-19 patients, the mean cholesterol (126 ±
41.02 mg/dL), LDL (69.5 ± 34.9 mg/dL) and HDL (29.9 ± 12.19 mg/dL) levels were
lower compared to healthy control group (157.7 ± 37.1mg/dL, LDL: 100.6 ±
27.64mg/dL and 41.43 ± 15.01 mg/dL, respectively) (Figure 1). On the other hand,
both mean triglyceride (155.4 ± 72.49 mg/dL) and VLDL (31.09 ± 14.5 mg/dL)
levels were higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy control (115 ± 65.07
mg/dL and 23 ± 13.01 mg/dL) (Figure 1).

To establish if differences between the lipid profile can accurately use to
distinguish between COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals, ROC curves were
used to determine optimal cut-off points and AUC for each lipid parameter. Based
on Youden's J index, the results of the ROC analysis, optimal cut-off, and the AUC
calculations are shown in Table 2. Cholesterol and LDL showed optimal predictive
value as well as higher sensitivity (greater than 60%) and specificity (greater than
80%) and AUC values of 0.710 and 0.769, respectively (Table 2).

In further analysis, to determine if there were differences between the lipid profile in
COVID-19 patients according to severity, non-critical and critical. Lower cholesterol
(119 mg/dL, IQR: 94.5 - 154.5 mg/dL, n= 38), LDL (50 mg/dL, IQR: 33 - 87.75
mg/dL, n= 36), and HDL (26 mg/dL, IQR: 16-43 mg/dL, n= 35) values were
observed in critical compared with non-critical patients (cholesterol: 125 mg/dL,
IQR: 102 - 160.8, n= 64; LDL: 69 mg/dL, IQR: 48.25- 95.25 mg/dL, n= 58; HDL: 30
mg/dL, IQR: 22 - 36.5 mg/dL, n= 61), while median values of triglycerides (145
mg/dL, IQR: 100.5 - 201.5 mg/dL, n= 37) and VLDL in critical patients were higher
than median triglycerides and VLDL values in no-critical (138 mg/dL, IQR: 103 –
105 mg/dL, n= 61, and 27.6 mg/dL, IQR: 20.6 - 41 mg/dL, for triglycerides and
VLDL, respectively). However, only median LDL values differences were
statistically significant among non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients (Figure 2).

4. Discussion
Lipids are essential components of the human body, and they are involved in
metabolic diseases such as diabetes, which is characterized by elevated total
cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides serum levels

31,32

. Also, increased serum

levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and decreased HDL are known to be
associated with the significant risk factors for Cardiovascular Disease and
hypertension

33

. Interestingly, changes in serum lipid profiles are prognostic

indicators of diseases, including viral infections. In this sense, clinical research
indicates that patients infected with human immunodeficiency (HIV)
(DENV)

23–25

, and hepatitis B (HBV)

A recently published study performed in China found that LDL and total cholesterol
levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared with the control
group

15

. In the same way of evidence, Fan et al. reported a similar pattern of low

cholesterol, LDL, and HDL levels in a group of 21 patients with COVID-19 in
16

. Therefore, it appears that there is a pattern of dyslipidemia that

Wuhan, China

may be characteristic of patients with COVID-19. However, it is true that worldwide
there is a wide variation in serum lipid profile levels depending on the different
population groups 33.

In the present study, conducted in a Mexican population, significant changes in the
lipid profile of patients with COVID-19 was found. The same pattern of dyslipidemia
observed in previously reported studies in Asia was also observed in the Mexican
population

15,16

, as low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL, while high levels of

triglycerides and VLDL when compared with a group of healthy individuals. This
repeating pattern in lipid profile changes in COVID-19 patients made us propose
the lipid profile changes as a possible biomarker for COVID-19. Therefore, through
a predictive model using ROC curves, we were able to detect the optimal cut-off
points of ≤99 mg/dL for cholesterol and ≤48 mg/dL for LDL, which could be
considered acceptable predictors for COVID-19 since they demonstrated to have
significant AUC values between 0.70 and 0.80 for diagnostic accuracy 34.

Serum dyslipidemia during the COVID-19 may be due to the role of lipids in SARSCov-2 replication in the host cell since they participate in the internalization of the
virus into the cell

35–37

, and in the dynamism of the lipid rafts in the membrane

where the ACE-2 receptor is located

38,39

. Also, SARS-CoV-2 regulates the lipidic

metabolism to generate viral membrane and pack its genome and in the exocytosis
of the virions

40,41

. For this reason, a growing recent interest in the lipids changes

research has been noted in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, since people with
metabolic diseases such as DM, HT, and obesity, possibly leading to a higher risk
of complications and mortality from COVID-19

42,43

. Our study found high

frequencies of comorbidities alone or in combination, such as HT, DM, and obesity
in COVID-19 patients. One of the main concerns of the Institute of Public Health is
the high prevalence of these comorbidities in the Mexican population 44,45.

At this moment, COVID-19 is considering as an emerging and rapidly evolving
condition. So, efforts to determine the change in laboratory parameters as
biomarkers have been directed towards the identification of severe or critical cases
of COVID-19

46,47

. In this regard, we stratified into non-critical and critical patients,

and the same pattern of low levels of cholesterol, LDL, and HDL was observed in
critical COVID-19 patients.

The above is in concordance with observed by Wei et al. previously reported

15

.

They divided COVID-19 patients per their severity into mild, severe, and critical
categories. They found that the development of hypolipidemia begins in patients
with mild symptoms and progressively worsens in association with the severity of
the disease

15

. However, they reported that triglyceride levels decreased

significantly in critical cases compared to mild and severe cases. Contrary to our
results, as higher triglyceride levels were found in critically ill patients with COVID16

19, but only median LDL levels differences were statistically different between noncritical and critical patients. In another similar research, Fan et al., besides
reporting a pattern of dyslipidemia similar to what has previously been observed in
patients with COVID-19, they also showed that degrees of decrease in LDL levels
are highly likely to be associated with the severity and mortality of the disease

16

.

The optimal cut-off point was for LDL in the ROC analysis, and we observed that
LDL might be a risk factor for critical COVID-19. Because of the low AUC value
obtained for LDL, it could not be considered an acceptable biomarker to
differentiate between non-critical and critical COVID-19 patients. This may be due
to the limitations of our study, such as sample size or the low statistical power
difference observed between both groups of patients. However, it cannot be ruled
out that LDL levels may be useful for decision making in the evolution of COVID-19
critically ill patients, and more studies are needed, especially in high-risk
populations.
