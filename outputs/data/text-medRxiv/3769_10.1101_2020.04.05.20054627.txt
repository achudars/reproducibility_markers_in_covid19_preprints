Abstract

37

Background

38

The novel coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has

39

spread rapidly throughout the world leading to catastrophic consequences. However, SARS-

40

CoV-2 infection has shown discernible variability across the globe. While in some countries

41

people are recovering relatively quickly, in others, recovery times have been comparatively

42

longer and number of individuals succumbing to it are high. This variability in coronavirus

43

disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility is suggestive of a likely association between the

44

genetic-make up of affected individuals modulated by their ancestry and the severity of

45

COVID-19 manifestations.

46

Objective

47

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential association between an individual’s genetic

48

ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 disease presentation employing Europeans as the case

49

study. In addition, using a genome wide association (GWAS) approach we sought to discern

50

the putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and genes that may be likely

51

associated with differential COVID-19 manifestations by comparative analyses of the

52

European and East Asian genomes.

53

Method

54

To this end, we employed 10,215 ancient and modern genomes across the globe assessing

55

597,573 SNPs obtained from the databank of Dr. David Reich, Harvard Medical School,

56

USA to evaluate the likely correlation between European ancestry and COVID-19

57

manifestations. Ancestry proportions were determined using qpAdm program implemented in

58

AdmixTools v5.1. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions

59

of European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance

60

was statistically evaluated. Genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed in

61

PLINK v1.9 to investigate SNPs with significant allele frequency variations among European

62

and East Asian genomes that likely correlated with differential COVID-19 infectivity.

63

Results

64

We found significant positive correlation (r=0.58, P=0.03) between West European hunter

65

gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio for data as of 5th

66

April 2020. This association discernibly amplified (r=0.77, P=0.009) upon reanalyses based

67

on data as of 30th June 2020, removing countries with small sample sizes and adding those

68

that are a bridge between Europe and Asia. Using GWAS we further identified 404 immune

69

response related SNPs by comparing publicly available 753 genomes from various European

70

countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern Asian countries. Prominently, we

71

identified that SNPs associated with immune-system related pathways such as interferon

72

stimulated antiviral response, adaptive and innate immune system and IL-6 dependent

73

immune responses show significant differences in allele frequencies [Chi square values

74

(≥1500; P≈0)] between Europeans and East Asians.

75

Conclusion

76

So far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the likely association

77

between host genetic ancestry and COVID-19 severity. These findings improve our overall

78

understanding of the putative genetic modifiers of COVID-19 clinical presentation. We note

79

that the development of effective therapeutics will benefit immensely from more detailed

80

analyses of individual genomic sequence data from COVID-19 patients of varied ancestries.

Introduction

87

The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was

88

officially identified on 7th January 2020 in Wuhan, China [1]. Since then, it has spread

89

rapidly throughout the world leading to devastating consequences. Notably, COVID-19,

90

caused by SARS-CoV-2 has shown significant worldwide variability, especially in terms of

91

the death/recovery ratio that pertains to a ratio of the number of deaths caused by it to

92

numbers of infected individuals who have recovered within the same time interval. While

93

affected individuals in some parts of the world have recovered relatively quickly with lower

94

morbidities, those from various other regions appear to remain sick for longer with slower

95

recovery times, more debilitating consequences and demonstrate relatively higher

96

death/recovery ratios [2]. For instance, Verity et al. (2020) estimated an overall fatality ratio

97

of 2·7% for COVID-19 cases reported outside of mainland China. For people with travel

98

history to mainland China this ratio was 1.1% and those without any travel history to China

99

the ratio was 3.6% [3]. This is suggestive of a likely population level genetic variation in

100

terms of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 manifestations.

101

A case in point in this context appears to be ACE2 that encodes for angiotensin I

102

converting enzyme 2 demonstrated to be the host receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 [4,5].

103

Recently, Cao et al. analysed 1700 variants in ACE2 from The China Metabolic Analytics

104

Project (ChinaMAP) and 1000 Genomes Project databases [6]. Their study revealed

105

significant variation in allele frequencies among the populations assessed, notably among

106

people of East Asian and European ancestries. They speculated that the differences in allele

107

frequencies of ACE2 coding variants, likely associated with its elevated expression may

108

influence ACE2 function and putatively impact the susceptibility, symptoms, and outcome of

109

SARS-CoV-2 infection in evaluated populations. Additionally, a majority of the 15

110

expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants they identified had discernibly higher allele

111

frequencies among East Asian populations compared to Europeans, which may suggest

112

differential susceptibility towards SARS-CoV-2 in these two populations under similar

113

conditions. Stawiski et al. who performed a comprehensive analysis on >290,000 samples

114

representing > 400 populations, also identified natural ACE2 variants that can potentially

115

alter the virus-host interaction and thus alter host susceptibility towards COVID-19

116

manifestations [7]. While some of these variants can potentially increase susceptibility for

117

COVID-19, others were speculated to be protective and surmised to display decreased

118

binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and thus decrease susceptibility to infection.

119

In addition to ACE2, COVID-19 manifestations may also be modulated by several

120

immune response modulating genes. Li et al. reviewed the interaction between coronaviruses

121

and the innate immune systems of the hosts [8]. It was speculated that coronavirus infection

122

can result in secretion of higher amounts of chemokines and cytokines such as interleukins

123

(IL 1, IL 6, IL 8, IL 21), Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)

124

protein-1 (MCP 1)) in infected cells. Further, the hosts’ major antiviral machinery, largely

125

composed of interferons (IFNs) can also act to restrain SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall it

126

may be speculated that variations in host genes involved it its antiviral response may be

127

responsible for differential clinical presentation of COVID-19. Recently, genetic variability

128

across major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes [9] and apolipoprotein E

129

(APoE) [10] have also been associated with severity of COVID-19 manifestations.

130

β and monocyte chemoattractant

Further recent studies have shown that variants associated with immune

131

responsiveness display significant population-specific signals of natural selection [11]. In

132

particular, the authors showed that admixture with Neanderthals may have differentially

133

shaped the immune systems in European populations, introducing novel regulatory variants,

134

which may affect preferential responses to viral infections. European genomes were further

135

modulated and distinguished owing to multiple waves of migration throughout their ancient

136

past. We note here that while Neolithic European populations predominantly descended from

137

Anatolian migrants, European ancestry shows a distinct West–East cline in indigenous West

138

European hunter gatherers (WHGs) [12]. At the same time Eastern Europe was in the

139

rudimentary stages of the formation of Bronze Age steppe ancestry, which later spread into

140

Central and Northern Europe through East-West expansion [13]. Further, high genetic

141

substructure between North-Western and South-Eastern hunter-gatherers has also been

142

documented recently [14].

143

Ancestry specific variation in immune responsiveness and its potential genetic and

144

evolutionary determinants are poorly understood especially in the context of SARS-CoV-2

145

infection and COVID-19 disease manifestations. In addition, despite its broad implications in

146

identifying novel variants putatively associated with variation in host immune responses

147

across different ancestries, only a handful of genome wide association study (GWAS) have

148

been performed pertaining to viral infections, especially in the context of SARS-CoV-2

149

infection [15].

150

Here we aimed to unravel the potential association between host genetic ancestry and

151

COVID-19 disease employing Europeans as the case study. In addition, using a GWAS

152

approach we sought to discern the putative single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)s, genes

153

and pathways that may be potentially associated with differential COVID-19 infection by

154

comparative analyses of the European and East Asian genomes. To the best of our

155

knowledge, so far this is the first study to assess the relationship between host genetics and

156

SARS-CoV-2 severity comparing individuals from distinct ancestries.

[2]. The data available in this web portal as of Sunday, 5th April 2020, 6 PM was used in the

170

primary analyses. To evaluate the robustness of our results, we repeated our analyses with the

171

data available in Johns Hopkins CSSE web portal as of 30th June 2020, 4:33 AM. Indian

172

state-wise data was obtained from John Hopkins CSSE portal and confirmed through

Ancestry proportions in European genomes and COVID-19 manifestations

177

We employed whole genome data from ten European countries in the initial analyses (Table

178

1). During reanalysis, countries such as Norway, Czech Republic and Ukraine were removed

179

due to smaller sample size (N<15). Instead, Eastern European countries such as Romania,

180

Bulgaria, and those that bridge between Europe and Asia such as Georgia, Turkey and

181

Armenia were included. Further, UK that did not provide officially updated COVID-19

182

recovery information was excluded during reanalysis. Furthermore, a larger sample size was

183

employed for Italians (TSI) obtained from 1000 genomes project database (Table 2).

184

We used qpAdm [20] implemented in AdmixTools v5.1 [21,22] to estimate ancestry

185

proportions in the European genomes originating from a mixture of ‘reference’ populations

186

by utilizing shared genetic drift with a set of ‘outgroup’ populations. 14 ancient genomes

187

namely Luxembourg_Loschbour.DG, Luxembourg_Loschbour_published.DG,

188

Luxembourg_Loschbour, Iberia_HG (N=5), Iberia_HG_lc, Iberia_HG_published,

189

LaBrana1_published.SG, Hungary_EN_HG_Koros (N=2),

190

Hungary_EN_HG_Koros_published. SG were grouped together as West European Hunter-

191

Gatherers (WHGs); three ancient genomes namely Russia_EHG, Russia_HG_Samara and

192

Russia_HG_Karelia (N=2) were grouped together as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of Eastern

193

Europe (EHGs); two ancient genomes: KK1.SG, SATP.SG were grouped as Caucasus hunter-

194

gatherers (CHGs) and Sweden_HG_Motala (N=8) were renamed as Scandinavian Hunter-

195

Gatherers (SHGs) in qpAdm analysis. We tried to model modern-day Europeans with

196

different combinations of Neolithic Near-East populations such as Neolithic Iranians

197

(Iran_GanjDareh_N), Neolithic Anatolians (Anatolia_N) and Natufians (Israel_Natufian)

198

alongside various combinations of ancient European Hunter Gatherer populations (WHG,

199

EHG, CHG and SHG) as mentioned in Lazaridis et al. (2016) [23]. We inferred that modern-

200

day Europeans could be best modelled as a combination of three source populations namely

201

EHGs, WHGs and Neolithic Iranians (Iran_GanjDareh_N) as Left (EHG, WHG,

202

Iran_GanjDareh_N). We used a mixture of eight ancient and modern-day populations

‘Right’ outgroup populations (O8).

205

Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between various ancestry proportions of

206

European genomes and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio was calculated and its significance

207

was statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism v8.4.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego,

208

California USA [24]. Additionally, we developed several linear regression models with

209

different combinations of WHG ancestry fraction (x1) alongside climatic factors such as 15

210

days’ mean temperatures (x2) and 15 days’ mean humidity (x3) of the ten European countries

211

employed in this study to statistically evaluate their impact on COVID-19 death/recovery

212

ratio (y) using glm function implemented in R v3.6.3 (Table 1, Supplemental Table 1). One-

213

tailed tests were performed considering the alternative hypothesis of positive association of

214

x1, x2 and x3 with y (

215

(LRT), employing lrtest function, implemented in R package ‘epicalc’. Temperature and

216

humidity data were obtained from Time and Date.com [25], which garners meteorological

217

data from leading meteorological institutes such as The World Meteorological Organization

218

[26] and Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) [27]. Ancestry and

0). The best model was determined by likelihood ratio test

Notably, the death/recovery ratio was used in this study as the test statistic as it can

222

potentially best reflect the extent to which individuals have succumbed versus those

223

recovering owing to COVID-19 infection. We believe that this ratio likely best reflects host

224

immune responsiveness against viral assault, especially since it does not take into account the

225

number of active cases and statistical biases arising due to population size, spread of the

226

disease and under-reporting/under-testing of COVID-19 cases.

Genome-wide association analyses (GWAS)

230

Genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify novel genetic variants

231

that show significant variation between genomes of European and East Asian ancestries. In

232

GWAS, European genomes (N=753) with higher death/recovery ratio (Cases) were compared

233

against Eastern Asian genomes (N=838) with low death/recovery ratio (Controls). To this

234

end, standard case–control-based association analyses was performed in PLINK v1.9 using --

235

assoc command. A sorted list of association results will be generated using --adjust flag to the

236

--assoc command. Chi square test, implemented in PLINK –assoc command, was performed

separately for all 597,573 SNPs to statistically assess their significance and for stringency P

238

<0.01 was considered significant. A Manhattan plot was generated in Haploview [29] by

239

plotting Chi square values of all assessed SNPs to identify the SNPs that are likely associated

240

with COVID-19 manifestations. Highly significant SNPs were annotated using SNPnexus

web-based server [30].

Ancestry proportions in European genomes and COVID-19 manifestations

247

We modelled all Europeans as a combination of three source populations namely EHGs,

248

WHGs and Neolithic Iranians (see Methods) in qpAdm analysis. Among 10 European

249

populations employed in this study, GBR (British in England and Scotland) genomes were

250

found to have the highest WHG ancestry proportions (26.1%) (Fig. 1a, Table 1). Notably,

251

among the European populations evaluated, COVID-19 death/recovery ratio till 5th April

252

2020, was the highest among the British people: death/recovery ratio=31.94 (Fig. 1b, Table

253

1). However, we omitted GBR genomes in our reanalysis due to absence of updated COVID-

254

19 recovery information from UK. In contrast, Russian and Finnish populations which could

255

not be modelled with WHG ancestry so far appear to have less detrimental COVID-19

256

manifestations with 0.02 and 0.05 death/recovery ratio, respectively (Fig. 1a and 1b).

257

Consistent with this, we found significant positive correlation (Pearson’s Correlation; r=0.58;

258

P=0.03) between WHG ancestry fraction and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio. The

259

association discernibly increased (r=0.77, P=0.009) upon reanalysing the data, omitting

260

countries with small sample sizes and adding those that form a bridge between Europe and

261

Asia.

262

Congruent with correlation results, we found significant linear positive association

263

between WHG ancestry fraction and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (Model 0) (R2=0.34, P

264

=0.039) (Table 1). However, we did not find any association between 15 days’ mean

265

temperature (Model 1) and humidity (Model 2) with COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (P

266

=0.49 and 0.29 respectively) (Table 1). Moreover, we found significant association between

267

the combination of WHG ancestry and temperature (Model 3), WHG ancestry and humidity

268

(Model 4), and WHG ancestry and a combination of both climatic factors (temperature and

269

humidity, Model 6) with COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (R2=0.33, 0.39 and 0.4

270

respectively) (Table 1). However, in all cases the significance of the test was driven by the

271

WHG ancestry fraction alone (P=0.04, 0.04 and 0.05 for Model 3, Model 4 and Model 6

272

respectively) and not by the climatic factors (Ptemperature=0.54, Phumidity=0.23, and

273

Ptemperature=0.61 and Phumidity=0.23 for Model 3, Model 4 and Model 6 respectively).

274

Consistent with this, Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) determined Model 0 to be the best model,

275

indicating that the extent of COVID-19 disease severity can be best explained by variability

276

in WHG ancestry fractions among European populations. Model 0 was found to be highly

277

significantly better than Model 1 (Temperature alone) and Model 2 (Humidity alone) (P≈0)

278

in recapitulating the variability of COVID-19 death/recovery ratio among the study

279

populations, suggesting that climatic factors such as colder temperature and variation in

280

humidity alone cannot explain the variability of COVID-19 disease in European countries.

281

Further, the combination of ancestry and temperature, ancestry and humidity (Model 3 and 4

282

respectively), and the combination of ancestry and climate (temperature + humidity) (Model

283

6) failed to explain variabilities in COVID-19 death/recovery ratio better than ancestry alone

284

(Model 0) (P =0.88, 0.36 and 0.61 respectively). This largely eliminates the possibility of

285

regional climate playing major role in the severity of COVID-19 presentation.

286

The association between WHG ancestry fraction (Model 0) and COVID-19

287

death/recovery ratio discernibly increased during reanalysis (R2=0.59, P=0.009) (Table 2).

288

Consistent with the initial analysis, we did not find any association between 15 days’ mean

289

temperature (Model 1) and humidity (Model 2) with COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (P

290

=0.55 and 0.31 respectively) and found significant association between the combination of

291

WHG ancestry and temperature (Model 3), WHG ancestry and humidity (Model 4), and

292

WHG ancestry and the combination of both climatic factors (temperature and humidity,

293

Model 6) with COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (R2=0.6, 0.61 and 0.61 respectively) (Table

294

2). However, similar to our initial analysis, the significance of the test was driven by the

295

WHG ancestry fraction alone (P=0.01, 0.01 and 0.02 for Model 3, Model 4 and Model 6

296

respectively) and not by the climatic factors (Ptemperature=0.33, Phumidity=0.28, and

297

Ptemperature=0.48 and Phumidity=0.35 for Model 3, Model 4 and Model 6 respectively) (Table 2).

298

Finally, congruent with our initial analysis, LRT determined Model 0 to be the best model,

299

indicating COVID-19 manifestations can be best explained by variability in WHG ancestry

300

fractions among European populations.

Genome-wide association analyses (GWAS)

314

For GWAS, 753 genomes from across Europe with high COVID-19 death/recovery ratio

315

(case) were compared against 838 Eastern Asian genomes with relatively lower COVID-19

316

death/recovery ratio (control). Out of 597,573 SNPs employed in this study, 385,450 (64.5%)

317

markers revealed highly significant variation (Chi square≥ 6.63; P<0.01) between Europeans

318

and East Asians, indicating the discernible differences in the genetic tapestry of the two

319

populations (Fig. 2). For stringency, we annotated only the top 10,000 ranked SNPs

320

(N=10,011, Chi square≥ 739; P≤9.69x10-163) using SNPnexus web-based server [30]

321

(Supplemental Table 2). Among top 10,000 ranked SNPs, 404 were associated with host

322

immune responsiveness including interferon (IFN) stimulated antiviral response, Interferon-

323

stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) mediated antiviral mechanism and 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase

324

(OAS) mediated antiviral response. These 10,000 SNPs are linked to 161 genes associated

325

with immune system regulation including those related to innate immunity, antiviral response

326

and receptors (eg. EDAR) (Supplemental Table 3). Our results indicate that pathways such as

327

those involved in immunoregulatory interactions between a lymphoid and a non-lymphoid

328

cell, adaptive and innate immune system, IL-6 dependent immune responses, and

329

complement cascades show significant variation between genomes of East Asian and

330

European ancestry. Among these, type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory

331

immune responses have been shown to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection [31].

332

Furthermore, the SNPs with the highest Chi square values (≥1500; P≈0) were found

333

to be associated with immune system related pathways such as Senescence-Associated

334

Secretory Phenotype (SASP), Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 signaling, TNFR2 non-

335

canonical NF-kB pathway and Class I MHC mediated antigen processing and presentation

336

(Supplemental Table 4). Among these, Interleukin mediated ‘cytokine storm’ has been shown

337

to be associated with pulmonary inflammation among COVID-19 patients [32], and the

338

genetic variation in Class I MHC has been associated with severity of COVID-19

339

manifestations [9].

340

Finally, six immune system related SNPs (rs2243250, rs1800872, rs1800896,

341

rs1544410, rs1800629 and rs1805015) that display significant variability between Europeans

342

and East Asians (Odds Ratio>2, Chi square>40, P<10-10) are likely associated with the

343

development of immune responses in the first year of life contingent upon the gene-

344

environment interactions [33].

Discussion

349

While in some areas affected individuals are recovering relatively quicker, in others, recovery

350

times have been comparatively longer, and mortality high. Here, we sought to investigate the

351

likely association between genetic ancestry determinants and the extent of COVID-19

352

manifestations employing Europeans as a case study.

353

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown discernible worldwide variability.

We found a significant positive correlation (r=0.58, P=0.03) between West European

354

hunter gatherers (WHG) ancestral fractions and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio which

355

discernibly increased (r=0.77, P=0.009) upon reanalyses as of 30th June 2020, removing

356

countries with small sample sizes and including those from intermediate geographical

357

locations between Europe and Asia, such as Georgia, Armenia and Turkey. We identified 404

358

immune response related SNPs by comparing publicly available data from 753 genomes

359

corresponding to various European countries against 838 genomes from various Eastern

360

Asian countries using GWAS. We found that SNPs associated with immune-system related

361

pathways such as interferon stimulated antiviral response, adaptive and innate immune

362

system and IL-6 dependent immune responses show significant differences in allele

363

frequencies [Chi square values (≥1500; P≈0)] between Europeans and East Asians.

364
365
366

The European story

367

Europe has been severely impacted owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings

368

revealed a significant positive correlation between WHG-related ancestry and COVID-19

369

death/recovery ratio (Pinitial analysis=0.03, Preanalysis=0.009). Further, we found significant linear

370

positive association between WHG ancestry fraction and COVID-19 death/recovery ratio

371

(R2initial analysis=0.34, Pinitial analysis =0.039, R2reanalysis=0.59, Preanalysis =0.009). Additionally, we

372

found that the regional climate alone is unlikely to play a major role in determining the

373

severity of COVID-19 disease. Previously it has been shown that European genomes evolved

374

uniquely with regards to immune responsiveness, particularly pertaining to responses against

375

viral infections [8]. Admixture with Neanderthals is believed to have introduced unique

376

regulatory variants into European genomes, which potentially regulated immune

377

responsiveness in European populations [7].We surmise that the European genome

378

architecture has been extensively modulated by the complex origin and migration history of

379

modern-day Europeans during Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods that led to the

380

introduction of novel variants in European genomes.

381

Modern-day European genomic diversity has been thought to be shaped by variable

382

proportions of local hunter-gatherer ancestry (WHGs) [34]. While Neolithic, Iberian genomes

383

(modern day Spanish and Portuguese populations) revealed widespread evidence of WHG

384

admixture (10-27%), Neolithic German populations (Linearb and keramik– LBK culture)

385

revealed ~4–5% of the same [34]. Notably the variation in WHG ancestry fractions among

386

German and Spanish people correlated with the observed variabilities in COVID-19

387

death/recovery ratio in these two countries; German populations with discernably lower

388

WHG fractions have a current death/recovery ratio of 0.05, however, in Spain the ratio is

389

0.19, which corresponded to high WHG fraction among Spanish populations. A similar

390

correlation between WHG ancestry and the extent of COVID-19 manifestations was observed

391

for the UK, where GBR genomes depicted high WHG ancestry fractions (>25%) and was

392

correlated with high COVID-19 death/recovery ratio in the country (31.94). We note here

393

that due to unavailability of official COVID-19 recovery information from the UK since

394

April 2020, we were unable to include UK in our reanalyses.

395

Italy, one of the worst hit European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic

396

showed significant nationwide variation in the severity of disease manifestations

397

(death/recovery ratio=0.18) with a clear gradient in COVID-19 mortality rates from north to

398

south. While COVID-19 death/recovery ratio in Northern Italy is 0.19, the ratio is 0.15 in

399

Central Italy and 0.11 in Southern Italy. Interestingly, these numbers are consistent with

400

WHG fractions among Italian genomes. While Northern Italian genomes have ~23.1% WHG

401

ancestry fractions, the fraction reduces to 9.2% among Southern Italians (Fig. 1a and 1b).

402

In contrast, although COVID-19 cases have been rising rapidly in Russia, their

403

death/recovery ratio (0.02) has remained significantly lower than most European countries.

404

We assessed whether this is owing to their genomic make-up; all modern-day Russians

405

originated from two groups of East Slavic tribes: Northern and Southern [35] and have 0%

406

WHG ancestry fraction. They are genetically similar to modern-day other Slavic populations

407

such as Belarusians [35,36]. Consistent with this we observed significantly low COVID-19

408

death/recovery ratios in both Russia (0.02) and Belarus (0.01). In addition, COVID-19

409

manifestations were found to be far less detrimental in the Central Asian countries part of the

410

erstwhile Soviet Union (USSR) such as Kazakhstan (death/recovery ratio=0.01), Kyrgyzstan

411

(0.02), Tajikistan (0.01), and Uzbekistan (0.005).

412

Finally, Finnish genomes that were shaped predominantly by migrations from Siberia

413

~3500 years ago [36] with very small WHG ancestral fractions, also have a discernibly

414

smaller COVID-19 death/recovery ratio (0.05) compared to neighboring Sweden, where the

415

ratio (0.88) is among the highest in world as of 31st May, 2020, after which no official

416

recovery information was available [2]. We note here that hunter gatherer genomes from

417

Sweden have shown to form a WHG cluster including Loschbour and La Braña2, indicating

418

high affinity of Swedish genomes towards WHG ancestry [37].

419

Historically, Turkey has been a crossroad of major population migrations across

420

Eurasia and served as a socio-cultural bridge between Europe and Asia. A whole genome-

421

based study revealed that while the modern-day Turkish population are genetically similar to

422

Southern European populations such as Italians, most Turkish genomes show signatures of

423

recent genetic contribution from ancestral East Asian populations [38]. On the other hand,

424

modern-day Armenians derived 29% of their European ancestry from Tyrolean Iceman [39],

425

a 5300-year-old Copper age individual, discovered along Tisenjoch Pass of the Ötztal Alps

426

[40]. Consequently, WHGs who contributed discernible ancestry fractions to most

427

Europeans, provided very low fraction (<10%) of the same in the ancestries of Near

428

Easterners (Turkey, Georgia and Armenia) [37]. Consistent with this, COVID-19

429

death/recovery ratio in Turkey, Georgia and Armenia remained discernibly lower compared

430

to most European countries (0.03, 0.02 and 0.03 respectively), further underscoring the

431

importance of WHG-related ancestral components in determining the severity of COVID-19

432

manifestations.

433

Overall, our results have revealed a clear association between WHG ancestry

434

fractions and the acuteness of COVID-19 manifestations suggesting the presence of unique

435

underlying genetic variants in European genomes that maybe correlated with increased

436

disease susceptibility and immune responsiveness. It is noteworthy that despite being better

437

equipped in terms of medical facilities and resources for testing and providing care to

438

COVID-19 affected individuals, most western and central European countries have struggled

439

substantially with significantly higher death/recovery ratios, as compared to many Asian

440

countries that are experiencing an increasing burden of patients with chronic underlying

441

conditions necessitating efficient health care systems with integrated care [41]. This further

442

illuminate that the intrinsic host genetic make-up as determined by ancestry is a major

443

determinant of the severity of COVID-19 disease.

444
445
446

Intrinsic ‘protection’ for East Asians?

447

As noted above, significant variation in allele frequencies of ACE2 encoding for the host cell

448

receptor of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported between people of East Asian and European

449

ancestries [6]. The authors of this study speculated that the differences in allele frequencies of

450

ACE2 coding variants were likely associated with variable expression of ACE2 in tissues.

451

Additionally, they reported that most eQTL variants identified by them had discernibly

452

higher allele frequencies among East Asian populations compared to Europeans, which may

453

result in differential susceptibility towards SARS-CoV-2 infection in these populations under

454

similar conditions. Consistent with these findings we identified 404 SNPs that are associated

455

with host immune response, such as Interferon (IFN) stimulated antiviral response,

456

Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) mediated antiviral mechanism and 2′ -5′ oligoadenylate

457

synthase (OAS) mediated antiviral response that showed large differences in allele

458

frequencies between Europeans and East Asians. The genetic differences between East and

459

Southeast Asians with Europeans can be largely attributed to their distinctive ancestral

460

origins. Most East Asians derive their ancestry from Mongolian hunter-gatherers who

461

dispersed over Northeast Asia 6000-8000 years ago [42]. Similarly, Southeast Asians exhibit

462

a mixture of East Asian ancestry (Southern Chinese agriculturalist) and a diverged form of

463

Eastern Eurasian hunter-gatherer ancestry (EHGs) [43]. People with similar ancestry can be

464

found as far south as Indonesia [43]. As noted above EHG ancestry fraction does not appear

465

to be significantly associated with COVID-19 manifestations. In congruence with their

466

unique ancestral make-up, all East and Southeast Asian countries exhibit discernibly low

467

COVID-19 death/recovery ratio compared to most west and central European countries

468

(Japan=0.06, South Korea=0.02, Hong Kong=0.006, Taiwan=0.01, Thailand=0.02,

469

Malaysia=0.01 and Singapore=0.0007). Notably, in mainland China, where the novel corona

470

virus originated, COVID-19 death/recovery ratio has remained discernibly low (0.06).

471

Overall, our results indicate that people of East and Southeast Asian ancestry appear to be

472

intrinsically protected against the most debilitating effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

473
474
475

India: a variegated canvas for COVID-19

476

Indians have a long and complex history of admixture between immigrant gene-pools

477

originating primarily in West Eurasia, Southeast Asia and the Indian hunter-gatherer lineage

478

with close genetic proximity to the present-day Andamanese people (Ancient Ancestral South

479

Indians: AASI) who likely arrived in India through the “southern exit” wave out of Africa

480

[44]. People of AASI ancestry admixed with an undivided ancient Iranian lineage that

481

subsequently split and lead to the formation of early Iranian farmers, herders, and hunter

482

gatherers approximately in the 3rd millennium BCE. This gene pool is referred to as the

483

‘Indus Periphery’ gene pool [44,45], which is thought to be the major source of subsequent

484

peopling of India. Modern-day Indian genome is composed of largely four ancestral

485

components: Ancestral North Indian (ANI), Ancestral South Indian (ASI), Ancestral Tibeto-

486

Burman (ATB) and Ancestral Austro-Asiatic (AAA) [46]. ANI and ASI gene pools likely

487

arose around 2nd millennium BCE during the decline of Indus Valley Civilization (IVC),

488

which prompted multiple waves of migrations across the India. The southward migration of

489

Middle to Late Bronze Age people from Steppe (Steppe MLBA) into India is thought to have

490

coincided with the decline of IVC. It is speculated that the people of Indus-Periphery-related

491

ancestry, while migrating northward, admixed with Steppe MLBA immigrants to form the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054627; this version posted September 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this

492

ANI, while the others, who migrated southward and eastward admixed with AASI and

493

formed the ASI [45]. Austroasiatic speakers originated in Southeast Asia and subsequently

494

migrated to India during the Neolithic period. The admixture between local Indians and

495

incoming Southeast Asians took place ~2000-3800 years ago giving rise to the AAA

496

ancestry. Notably, the Indian population(s) with whom the incoming Southeast Asians

497

mingled were AASI related with little to no West Eurasian ancestry fraction [47]. Finally, it

498

has been showed that the Tibeto-Burmans (ATBs) derived their ancestry through admixture

499

with low-altitude East Asians who migrated from China and likely across Northern India or

500

Myanmar [48] leading to the high genomic proximity between Indians of ATB ancestry and

501

East Asians.

502

We believe that the severity of COVID-19 disease presentation is likely to vary

503

appreciably across the Indian populations. The genomic proximity between East Asians and

504

Indians mostly from Northeast India with prominent ATB ancestry, is reflected through lower

505

COVID-19 mortality rates from this region with Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim

506

not registering any COVID-19 related death as of 30th June 2020 [19]. Notably the

507

death/recovery ratio in the largely ATB dominated region of Ladakh, India is 0.001,

508

indicating almost complete recovery so far amidst COVID-19 infected individuals from this

509

region.

510

Indian states with large number of indigenous tribal population with high prevalence

511

of AAA ancestry and/or with large fractions of AASI-related ancestry, eg. Andaman and

512

Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa have registered very few COVID related

513

deaths till date (death/recovery ratio 0, 0.005, 0.008, 0.004 respectively). Furthermore, Tamil

514

Nadu, despite ranking among the top three worst affected states in India, in terms of the

515

numbers of COVID-19 positive cases have registered significantly lower COVID-19

516

death/recovery ratio (0.02) that could be attributed to discernible fractions of AASI-related

517

ancestry among the people from this area. This indicates that Indians with predominant AAA

518

and AASI related ancestry may likely be less severely affected against the most detrimental

519

effects of COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, states with predominant ANI ancestry

520

such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi have shown discernibly higher

521

COVID-19 mortality rates (0.08, 0.08, 0.06 and 0.05, respectively).

522

We also note that approximately 83% of WHG ancestry has been associated with

523

mitochondrial DNA U haplogroup [49,50]. Overall, 13.1% Indians belong to U haplogroup

524

and are thus associated with WHG related ancestry [51]. And the U haplogroup frequency

525

shows discernible variation among Indian populations, while 23.3% North Indians belong to

526

U haplogroup, 10.3% South Indians belong to the same [51]. U haplogroup also shows

527

discernible variation across Indian societal structure, while 15% of Indian upper castes

528

belong to U haplogroup, 8% of Indian tribal populations (mostly of AAA ancestry) have the

529

same [52]. Taken together, overall ~8-19% Indians are likely to have WHG related ancestry.

530

Notably, our previous whole genome-based study found most Gujarati people to have ~3-4%

531

WHG related ancestry [53], similar to what is observed for Turkish Jews in the current study.

532

Our interrogation of worldwide populations suggests that the WHG ancestral fraction is

533

likely associated with acute COVID-19 manifestations and is predictive of debilitating effects

534

of COVID-19 infection among Indian populations with substantial fractions of WHG

535

ancestry. Overall COVID-19 manifestations in India is likely to be somewhat intermediate to

536

that observed in Europe and East Asia. This is also supported by the recent finding that allele

537

frequencies of ACE2 variants among Indians are intermediate between East Asians and

538

Europeans [6].

539
540
541

Limitations and conclusion

542

The present study shines light of underlying genetic signatures that may be associated with

543

disparate COVID-19 severity and manifestations in worldwide populations. Nevertheless we

544

note that the current work has been performed using publicly available genomic data and a

545

more robust understanding in this regard will emanate from sequencing/genotyping

546

endeavours for COVID-19 patients across the spectrum of varied nationalities/ancestries and

547

geographical locations, including individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, severe

548

manifestations and death. We further note that since the current analyses is performed using

549

pre-existing genomic data, there is a disparity in number of individuals sequenced among

550

various populations which might influence the analyses in terms of statistical power and

551

errors.

552

We also note that populations from most European countries have higher mean ages

553

compared to India, which may accentuate mortality rates among Europeans. However, as

554

reported recently age alone may not suffice in exacerbating death/recovery ratios, and

555

underlying health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease,

556

hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancers, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis etc.,

557

many of which are already described as crucial comorbidity factors for COVID-19 may

558

modify disease manifestations and prognosis in patients [54]. It is imperative to consider here

559

that although the mean population age is lower in India compared to most European

countries, 7.7% Indians suffer from diabetes [55], 25.3% suffer from hypertension [56] and

561

approximately 14.5% suffer from some form of respiratory disorders linked to air pollution

562

[57], all of which are underlying health conditions that are reported to cause higher COVID-

563

19 death/recovery ratio [46]. Therefore, lower death/recovery ratio among Indians,

564

particularly in specific populations compared to most European countries highlights the role

565

of host genetic constitution in influencing COVID-19 disease progression.

566

Finally, several factors such as demographics (eg. population size and density),

567

healthcare facilities and hospital infrastructure, administrative preparedness and

568

implementation of social isolation and lockdowns were beyond the scope of the current study

569

but may influence the death/recovery metric of a country. Taken together our results strongly

570

advocate for the adoption of a rigorous worldwide population genetics driven approach to

571

expand and substantiate our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as

572

facilitate the development of population specific therapeutics to mitigate this worldwide

573

challenge.
