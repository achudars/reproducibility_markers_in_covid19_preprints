Introduction

54

The SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to severe disruptions to routine public

55

health services on a global scale. These disruptions are expected to be particularly

56

pronounced in low- and middle-income countries due to already under-resourced

57

healthcare systems. On April 1

61

framework, allowing countries to restart routine MDA given careful risk assessment.

62

Onchocerciasis is one such PCT disease, centred on ivermectin (Mectizan®) MDA, delivered

63

annually in the majority of endemic countries in Africa.

65

Although so-called ‘lockdowns’ and delayed MDA might be effective in temporally reducing

66

the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the implications for both short- and long-term

67

onchocerciasis transmission are less clear. The impact of the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa

68

(2013–2016) on morbidity due to other diseases (such as tuberculosis and HIV) can provide

69

some insight into the implications of withdrawing routine public health services.

70

comparability is limited due to the stark differences in the scale and manifestations of Ebola

71

and COVID-19. There are concerns that delaying MDA might increase onchocerciasis

72

morbidity in the short term, and in the long term, undermine progress made towards the

81

Delayed ivermectin MDA, or reduced treatment coverage, could result not only from

82

population-wide lockdowns to reduce COVID-19 transmission and the resulting redirection

84

production and supply chains, or exceeded drug shelf-life by the time MDA

recommences).

87

for ivermectin donation to endemic countries), might also be problematic. In addition to

88

these challenges, programmes will have to be adaptive in the face of unforeseen setbacks

89

which may emerge as MDA recommences, remedial strategies (such as increased MDA

90

coverage and/or frequency) are attempted, and as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.

95

benefit of remedial mitigation strategies to help programmes get back on track. Although

In this paper, we use the EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM transmission models to: i) quantify

104

where (in terms of transmission setting and treatment history) the impact of interruptions

105

to ivermectin MDA for onchocerciasis will be most pronounced, allowing better planning

how mitigation strategies based on increased frequency (biannual MDA) of increased

outbreak in 2014?

127
128

In the context of a 1-year interruption or 1 year of missed MDA, the terms ‘interruption’ or

129

‘missed’ are used to describe a situation in which the MDA round planned to take place 12

130

months after a successful round pre-COVID19 is not delivered (regardless of the calendar

131

month in which treatment is usually distributed according to setting). ‘Remedial’ MDA

132

implies that once MDA can safely resume,

133

increased coverage within one round) is delivered. Hence, ‘remedial’ biannual MDA can be

134

interpreted as ‘delayed treatment’ if a round of annual MDA is not delivered when planned

135

but given in addition to the planned round in the following (not necessarily calendar) year.

136

Although, for simplicity, modelling results are presented as if MDA were delivered at the

137

beginning of each year, what is important is the duration between two consecutive MDA

138

rounds, and whether MDA is delivered with increased frequency or coverage when

139

treatment can recommence.

Modelling remedial strategies

196

We modelled the effectiveness of increasing frequency (to biannual treatment at 65%

197

coverage) or therapeutic coverage (to 75% for annual treatment) as strategies for mitigating

198

the impact of missed treatment rounds (either in 2020 or in 2020 and 2021). For a selection

199

of the scenarios described above, we investigated the capacity for remedial treatment to

200

revert the microfilaridermia trends and restore elimination probabilities (with MDA ceasing

201

in 2030) to those predicted without interruption. Typically, MDP only approves ivermectin

202

donations for biannual treatment if programmes can demonstrate sufficiently high coverage

203

in preceding years. Therefore, we assumed that remedial biannual MDA followed only after

204

a year of annual 65% coverage once programmes restart.

218

during 2020 and 2021 (with a 30% coverage at resumption in 2022). The models

219

qualitatively agree on how the temporal microfilarial prevalence trends during an

interruption differ from those for continuous MDA through 2020–2021 for MDA starting in

221

222

pronounced than after a 1-year (2020) interruption. How coverage, once treatment

recommences, influences the temporal dynamics of microfilarial prevalence after a 1-year

Temporal microfilarial prevalence trends:

245

a short treatment history, increasing treatment frequency, i.e. implementing remedial

246

biannual MDA at 65% coverage upon resumption of MDA, will be more effective at reducing

247

the impact of treatment disruptions than increasing treatment coverage (i.e. implementing

248

remedial 75% coverage of annual MDA). We illustrate these results after a 2-year

249

interruption (2020–2021) when MDA initially resumes at low annual coverage (30%, 2022),

250

returns to annual 65% coverage (2023), and then either increases to a 6-monthly frequency

251

for two consecutive years (2024–2025) at 65% coverage (Fig. 3), or increases to 75% annual

252

MDA coverage also for two consecutive years (2024–2025) (Fig. 4). Remedial biannual

253

treatment results in lower microfilarial prevalence leading up to 2030 (Fig. 4) than remedial

254

increased coverage (Fig. 3). The temporal microfilarial prevalence dynamics for a 1-year

255

interruption with either remedial increased treatment frequency or coverage are shown in

For the pre-existing biannual scenarios explored (which had achieved high pre-COVID-19

272

resurgence according to either model (Fig. 5). For this scenario, it was considered that

273

programmes would resume treatment in 2021 given their strong performance before

When assuming a 50% baseline microfilarial prevalence, there were small differences

Age profiles of microfilarial prevalence and intensity

289

EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM predict noticeably different age (and sex) patterns of

290

microfilarial prevalence and intensity after three rounds of annual ivermectin MDA, with or

291

without a 2-year (2020–2021) interruption (with MDA starting in 2017 and initial

292

microfilarial prevalence of 70%) (Fig. 7). EPIONCHO-IBM predicts higher prevalence and

293

intensity in children under the age of ten years following a 2-year MDA interruption than

294

when there is no MDA interruption, and this is particularly pronounced in boys (Fig. 7A and

295

7B for prevalence; 7E and 7F for intensity). Following the interruption, ONCHOSIM predicts

296

very low infection prevalence and intensity in children under 5 years, and an evident, but

297

smaller increase in 5–10-year olds than in EPIONCHO-IBM (Fig. 7C and 7D for prevalence; 7G

298

and 7H for intensity). By contrast, ONCHOSIM predicts a marked microfilarial prevalence

299

and intensity increase in the ≥20 years olds compared to EPIONCHO-IBM. (The baseline

300

profiles are shown as insets in Fig. 7; individual-level microfilarial load is illustrated in

301

Discussion

306

While in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, the WHO recommended to

307

suspend all epidemiological surveys and MDA activities for NTDs to help curtail the

308

transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

309

created concern in the NTD community regarding potential short-term increases in

310

transmission and impacts on longer-term elimination prospects for onchocerciasis,

particularly in the context of the EOT goals proposed by the WHO in its 2021–2030 NTD

313

transmission models, EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM, to investigate the impact of (1- and

314

2-year) interruptions to MDA in a variety of settings motivated by the epidemiological

315

situation in endemic areas in Africa.

5

In response to these concerns, we have used two stochastic onchocerciasis

316
317

Generally, the models suggest that programmes with short treatment histories of pre-

318

existing annual MDA (late-start programmes) will be the most vulnerable to a two-year

319

(2020–2021) interruption. Programmes with longer treatment histories (early-start

320

programmes) could also be adversely affected if initial endemicity levels indicate intense

321

(hyperendemic) transmission. The influence of baseline microfilarial prevalence was more

322

pronounced in EPIONCHO-IBM for both early- and late-start MDA programmes than in

323

ONCHOSIM. Although for late-start programmes a 1-year interruption to MDA impacted the

324

elimination probabilities and microfilarial prevalence in 2030, the effect would be more

325

tolerable than for a 2-year interruption; early-start programmes with lower pre-intervention

326

endemicities were mostly unaffected.

327
328

In July 2020, the WHO issued guidelines for the resumption of MDA provided it can be

329

delivered ‘safely’ following a case-by-case risk-benefit assessment, with due consideration

330

of a health system’s capacity to conduct such modified activities effectively in the context of

331

the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

332

the models allowed for a gradual scaling-up of therapeutic coverage once MDA resumes.

333

Both models predict that remedial biannual MDA (in 2024 and 2025, after having

334

demonstrated up-scaling to 65% coverage through 2022 and 2023) would be more effective

2

Therefore, the implementation of mitigation strategies in

at controlling increases in infection and decreases in elimination probabilities than remedial

336

high (75%) coverage of annual MDA (also in 2024 and 2025).

337
338

Both models also predicted that pre-existing biannual MDA programmes—which had

339

achieved a high treatment coverage for nearly a decade (in our simulations 75% pre-COVID-

340

19 coverage from 2012 inclusive to reflect a 90% coverage of eligible population)—would

341

not be adversely affected by a 1-year interruption. This was despite assuming a slow start of

difficulties in implementing treatment.

349

Some West African countries (e.g. Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) had already had their

350

ivermectin MDA programmes interrupted in 2014 due to the Ebola epidemic. We therefore

351

considered this situation, in addition to a 1-year COVID-19 interruption in 2020. Both

352

models predicted that in mesoendemic settings (50% baseline microfilarial prevalence),

353

these two separate 1-year interruptions would not greatly impact on programmes’

354

performance, provided that coverage levels can catch up reasonably quickly following

355

resumption of MDA (50% in 2021 and 65% in 2022 onwards). In hyperendemic and highly

356

hyperendemic settings (60% and 70% baseline microfilarial prevalence) the impact would be

357

more pronounced (particularly according to EPIONCHO-IBM).

Although programmes measure progress in terms of reducing mean infection prevalence

360

and intensity at population level, favourable infection trends may mask heterogeneities

369

Following a 2-year MDA interruption, children may not receive treatment until their 7

birthday, leading to a further microfilarial load build-up. Our modelling results indicate that

371

in late-start (e.g. 2017) and high initial endemicity programmes (e.g. 70% microfilarial

372

prevalence), there might be substantial increases in infection intensity in children aged <10

373

years, particularly according to EPIONCHO-IBM. In addition, both models predict that in

374

these settings, and following a 2-year MDA interruption, there will also be increases in

375

infection prevalence and intensity in older age groups (moderate in EPIONCHO-IBM but

376

pronounced in ONCHOSIM). This increase could lead to exacerbation of other

382

Although the models agree qualitatively on the role of treatment history in the outcome of

383

interruptions to ivermectin MDA, and the differences between remedial strategies in

384

mitigating the ensuing setbacks, ONCHOSIM predicts higher elimination probabilities than

385

EPIONCHO-IBM. This is partly because EPIONCHO-IBM assumes strong regulatory processes

386

operating on parasite establishment within humans that are relaxed as transmission

387

declines during interventions, increasing the stability and resilience of the host–parasite

388

system; these processes are not assumed in ONCHOSIM.

389

aforementioned differences in the assumed age- and sex-specific exposure patterns, and

390

associated age and sex profiles of infection results in ONCHOSIM predicting a lower

391

microfilarial intensity in children under 5, while in EPIONCHO-IBM there exists a larger

392

reservoir of infection in untreated children, which also contributes to lower elimination

probabilities.

In addition, the

395

An assumption made in most of the modelled scenarios model, is that when MDA resumes

396

coverage will initially be lower than pre-pandemic levels and could take several years to

397

recover. However, the usual drug distribution modality, by which members of the

398

community present at a focal point to receive ivermectin, could be replaced by door-to-door

399

drug distribution (as a result of social distancing measures). Depending on local

400

circumstances, some programmes may achieve well-documented and high coverage levels,

401

although the latter would also rely on well-stocked supply chains.

402
403

We did not consider the potential use of moxidectin and/or vector control as alternative

remedial strategies to mitigate the impact of the current pandemic. This is because, while

these approaches are very promising,

407

considered as a complementary intervention, when it is more conducive than

408

410

Conclusions and Recommendations

411

Both EPIONCHO-IBM and ONCHOSIM indicate that ivermectin MDA programmes with

412

shorter treatment histories will be most vulnerable to MDA interruptions caused by the

413

COVID-19 pandemic, particularly if treatment cannot be resumed safely in 2021. This impact

414

may be noticeable in local infection resurgence in higher endemicity settings and may

415

reduce the probability of achieving EOT by 2030. Programmes with longer treatment

416

histories of annual MDA that have achieved and maintained a coverage of 65% are

417

predicted to be less affected (but not totally impervious) to interruptions of ivermectin

418

MDA, particularly if high initial endemicity indicates highly propitious transmission

419

conditions. Young children have the potential to be negatively affected by increased levels

420

of transmission resulting from missed MDA rounds, particularly for a 2-year interruption in

421

highly endemic settings recently incorporated to ivermectin MDA programmes, depending

422

on local age-exposure patterns.

423
424

The impact of COVID-19 on progress towards the WHO 2021–2030 goals is best ameliorated

425

by implementing biannual MDA as soon as pre-COVID-19 levels of therapeutic coverage are

426

restored (in our simulations to 65% of the total population in 2024–2025). This mitigation

427

strategy is indicated as more effective than increasing annual MDA coverage (to 75%).

429

MDA programmes should promptly conduct the risk-benefit evaluations indicated by the

430

WHO,

431

to resume MDA and regain pre-COVID-19 levels of coverage where possible (e.g. door-to-

432

door distribution with household members measuring themselves with disinfected height

433

poles and community drug distributors leaving tablets at the doorstep and observing

434

household members swallowing the tablets with safe social distancing). Additionally, in

guidance on how best to implement MDA in the context of COVID-19.
