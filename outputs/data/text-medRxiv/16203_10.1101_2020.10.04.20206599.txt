WORLDWIDE CASE FATALITY RATIO OF COVID-19 OVER TIME

ABSTRACT
Background
The case fatality ratio (CFR) of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been
reported to be variable among different countries and regions but few analyses have
tracked this ratio worldwide over time.
Methods
The primary objective was to assess the time-course evolution of CFR of COVID-19
in all countries with available data and secondary objective was to evaluate
associations between country-wise CFR and country-level health, human
development, demographic and economic parameters. Day-wise data of COVID-19
cases and deaths for each country was extracted from a public repository and
countries with at least 1000 cases on cutoff date were clustered by unsupervised kmeans on the basis of deaths per 100000 population (DP100K). Day-wise CFR
(cumulative deaths divided by cumulative cases, multiplied by 100) for each country
and cluster (country group) was plotted as time-series and country-level parameters
were tested for association with CFR using weighted multiple linear regression.
Results
On September 24, 2020 there were 32140504 cumulative COVID-19 cases and
981792 deaths reported from 184 countries for a worldwide CFR of 3.06 % (95%CI
3.05 -3.07). Unsupervised k-means clustering in 157 countries with at least 1000
reported cases resulted in Clusters (country groups) A, B, C, D and E with centroid
DP100K and CFR of 0.100 and 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 0.503 and 2.28 (95% CI
2.23-2.33), 1.816 and 1.73 (95% CI 1.71-1.75), 7.395 and 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76),

and 36.303 and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively. In a log-log analysis DP100K
and CFR were significantly positively correlated (R=0.3570, p<0.001) with each
other. All country groups and majority of included countries showed a pattern of
gradually increasing CFR from the beginning of pandemic, followed by a plateau and
then a steady decline in CFR. Among 10 country-level parameters, GDP per capita
(β=-0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population (β=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality
from air pollution (β=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density (β=-0.570, p< 0.000)
were significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio (β=0.431,
p=0.000) and age (β=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR.
Conclusions
The CFR of COVID-19 has gradually increased over time in majority of countries at
various stages of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and a steady decline.
Population level COVID-19 mortality burden and CFR are significantly positively
associated with each other.

BACKGROUND
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), has caused a worldwide pandemic of massive proportions with a large
number of fatalities. There is no proven vaccine to prevent this infection and, as yet,
no proven treatment with high efficacy. It is also uncertain whether infected
individuals will develop long lasting immunity. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease,
manifested primarily by pneumonia and respiratory failure, in a small proportion of
cases and this is the primary cause of mortality. Because of the high person-toperson transmission, SARS-CoV-2 has overwhelmed the healthcare systems of
many countries, including several high-income countries.
From a public health perspective, it is of great importance to be able to have
accurate estimates of the case fatality ratio of an epidemic disease. The reported
case fatality ratios of COVID-19 have ranged from 0.5% to almost 10% in various
countries with reported variation within countries as well. The propensity to suffer
severe disease and death from COVID-19 has been reported to be impacted by
many factors including patient’s age and comorbidity status, with older individuals or
those with comorbidities having a higher mortality rate [1-7].
Because these and other as yet unknown factors impact mortality and are variably
distributed between countries and regions, it is difficult to compare unadjusted CFR
across countries. However, within the same country taken as a unit, the variability in
these factors is likely to be less, and therefore it may be relevant and insightful to
track the unadjusted CFR within countries over time. Such an analysis could provide
time trends that may help inform public health planning, forecasting and resource
allocation.

We performed, and report here, an analysis of the day-wise case fatality ratio of
COVID-19 in all countries, using an open source data repository that is regularly
updated, starting from the first reported case in that repository, until the data cut-off
date.
METHODS
Ethics Declaration: This analysis was performed by academic researchers from a
large tertiary cancer centre in India. Institutional ethics committee approval was not
sought for this analysis, as per institutional guidelines, because it did not involve
collection or handling of individual patient data. All the raw data used in this analysis
is available as supplementary files
Objectives
The primary objective was to analyse the time-course evolution of COVID-19 CFR in
individual countries, keeping a 24-hour day as the unit of time. The secondary
objectives were to correlate the country-wise CFR with 10 country-level health,
human development, demographic and economic parameters (listed below under
‘Data Extraction’) to identify any associations.
Eligibility Criteria
Countries whose time sequential data for COVID-19, in terms of cumulative cases,
cumulative deaths and cumulative recoveries, were reported in the COVID-19
GitHub Repository for the COVID-19 dashboard by the Center for Systems Science
and Engineering of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (CSSE-JHU)
[8], were included in the analysis. We excluded data from two cruise ships (The
Diamond Princess and MD Zandaam) which reported localized outbreaks of COVID19. Data from countries with at least 1000 cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases
reported on the cut-off date were included for unsupervised clustering based on
COVID-19 deaths per 100000 population (DP100K), plotting the CFR time-trends,

and performing the weighted multiple linear regression between country-level
parameters and CFR. The sources of data in this Repository include World Health
Organization, various national governments and other publically accessible
resources [9]. The analysis included data from the date of first reporting on this
Repository until the data cut-off date.
Data Extraction:
Data on COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths as on cut-off date were
downloaded from the online Repository (Supplementary Table 1) (9). The
downloaded data included the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths at
12 AM GMT on each date for each country for the included time period. Where
reported, the data for different geographical regions or sovereign territories for a
country was added up with data from its mainland territory to derive country-level
estimates.
The latest available data on ten different indices of health [(% mortality from cardio
vascular diseases (CVD), cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease (CRD) in
the age group 30-70, total smoking prevalence in age >/= 15 years, maternal
mortality ratio per 100000 live births, infant mortality ratio per 1000 live births),
human development (age standardized mortality rate per 100000 population
attributed to household and ambient air pollution, physicians per 1000 population,
and hospital beds per 1000 population), population demographics (median age of
population, population density in persons per square kilometre), and economic
development [(gross domestic product (GDP) per capita)] were extracted from the
World Bank Open Data (health, human development and economic development
indices) [10] and United Nations data hub (population demographics)
(Supplementary Table 2) on September 1, 2020 [11]. Additionally, each country’s
population for the year 2019 reported as of July 1, 2020 was also retrieved from the

World Bank Open Data hub [10] for calculating death per 100,000 (DP100K) of the
population for each country.

Data analysis:
Data analysis was performed using custom python scripts, GraphPad Prism version
8.02 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA and Microsoft Excel
(2019), Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA. Data visualization was performed
using Tableau Software v 2020.3, Seattle, USA. The Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) was
calculated as follows:

CFR (%) = [(Number of cumulative confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 / Number
of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the same time point)] × 100

We calculated the COVID-19 deaths per 100000 population (DP100K) for each
country using the total COVID-19 deaths on the cutoff date and country population
for the year 2019. The DP100K was used to group countries with various levels of
population-level COVID-19 mortality burden for depiction of CFR time-trends. Log
(base 2) transformed DP100K on the x-axis was plotted against log (base 2)
transformed CFR on the y-axis for countries with at least 1000 COVID-19 cases on
the cutoff date and a linear regression, with coefficient of correlation, computed
between these two variables. An unsupervised k-means clustering was performed
based on log DP100K using Tableau, which uses Lloyd’s algorithm with squared
Euclidean distances to estimate distances of all points in a cluster from the centroid
of that cluster and centroids in other clusters. The algorithm estimates the sums of
‘between cluster’ and ‘within cluster’ distances which are used to calculate the ratio
of variances for the above two metrics. At least 25 iterations were performed for

k=1…25 wherein for each value of k, the ratio of the two variances was used to
identify the first local maximum value for Calinski-Harabasz index (CH index) for
smallest value of k. We additionally generated Elbow plots to manually identify the
appropriate ‘k’ for clustering and see its agreement with C-H generated k. Wilcoxon
signed rank was used to compare the median CFR of each country group identified
by k-means clustering and this data visualised as violin plots. We calculated the CFR
for each day for each country from the downloaded data and depicted it date-wise for
each DP100K cluster. Data points that were outliers and skewed visual
representation were either plotted on a secondary y-axis and indicated in the graphs
or removed from visualization (Supplementary Table 3).
We estimated the mean change in CFR per day for the most recent 10 calendar
days from the cut-off date (including the cut-off date) for whole world, countries with
>/= 1000 cases, country clusters, and each country, by subtracting the CFR on day
minus10 from the CFR on the cut-off date, and dividing the difference by 10. A 2sided 95% confidence interval for CFR on the cut-off date was calculated for the
whole world, countries with >/= 1000 cases, each country cluster and each country.
CFR for countries with >/= 1000 cases on the cut-off date were evaluated for
independent association with 10 different country-level indices of health, human
development, population demographics, economic development and mobility using
weighted multiple linear regression analysis. Weighted regression was used
because different countries with different numbers of cases and deaths contributed
unequal amount of information. Weights were assigned using the inverse of the
square of the standard error of CFR for each country. The multicollinearity
assumption was tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Independence of
residuals and homoscedasticity assumptions were checked using Durbin-Watson
test and residuals plot (scatter plot of standardised residuals versus standardised

were removed systematically at each step until the model only included factors which
showed VIF < 10.

RESULTS
Case Fatality Ratio of COVID-19 over time
The data cut-off date was September 24, 2020 and included all cases and deaths
due to COVID-19 in the CSSE-JHU Repository from the first date of its reporting,
January 22, 2020. Of 195 countries, 184 have reported at least one confirmed case
of COVID-19 (Figure 1, supplementary table 4) and are including in the analysis. In
the 10 days preceding the cutoff date, 50 (27%) countries had a positive mean
change in CFR, 118 (64%) had a negative mean change in CFR, while 16 countries
(9%) had no net change in CFR (supplementary table 4). Figure 2.A depicts a map
of the world colour coded with different ranges of CFR as on September 24, 2020,
which shows that developed as well as less developed countries show high and low
CFR. One hundred fifty-seven countries with case load >/= 1000 with 32133634
cumulative cases and 981664 cumulative deaths are included in the CFR time-trend
analysis, unsupervised clustering analysis, and the weighted multiple linear
regression analysis.
Unsupervised k-means clustering of 157 countries by their DP100K identified five
clusters of countries (Supplementary Figure 1.A, Supplementary Table 5), A, B, C, D
and E and hereafter referred to as country groups A, B, C, D and E. Optimal k for
clustering was concurrent by CH-index in Tableau (Supplementary Table 6) as well
as an elbow plot which showed a disruption of bent of the elbow curve between k=56 (Supplementary Figure 2). Cluster separation was confirmed by Wilcoxon Signed

Rank test which was significant for all five country groups at an alpha of 0.05
(Supplementary Figure 3, Supplementary Table 7).
Figure 2.B shows 157 world countries distributed by their country groups identified
using k-means clustering. Table 1 shows the number of countries, cases, deaths,
CFR with 95%CI, DP100K, centroid DP100K, centroid CFR, and 10-day mean
change for clusters A to E. Supplementary Table 4 shows the CFR with 95% CI and
10-day mean change in CFR for individual countries in each country group.
Figure 3 shows the day-wise time trend of CFR for the whole world, countries with
case load >/= 1000 and country groups A to E and shows that the case fatality ratio
of COVID-19 has been increasing over time in all these clusters since the beginning
of the pandemic, followed by a plateau and then a downward trend. The CFR on
September 24, 2020 for whole world, countries with >/= 1000 cases, Group A, Group
B, Group C, Group D, and Group E were 3.06% (95% CI 3.057-3.07), 1.73 (95% CI
1.71-1.75), 2.51 (95% CI 2.42-2.61), 2.28 (95% CI 2.23-2.33), 1.73 (95% CI 1.711.75), 1.76 (95% CI 1.75-1.76), and 3.82 (95% CI 3.82-3.83), respectively (Table 1).
Forty-three countries (1 in Group A, 6 in Group B, 6 in Group C, 9 in Group D and 21
in Group E) had a CFR higher than that of world CFR of 3.06. Consistent with this
data, the CFR for Group E has tracked above the world average at all time points
and this group, while accounting for only 19% of the world population, contributes to
63% of COVID-19 cases and 78.8% of COVID-19 deaths reported worldwide
(Supplementary Figure 4 & Supplementary Table 8).
Figures 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D and 4E depict the time trends of CFR in individual countries
in five country groups along with the group CFR. For countries with highest DP100K
(Group E, Figure 4E), the general trend is increasing CFR over time, followed by
plateauing from late April 2020. As expected most countries show marked
fluctuations in the day-wise CFR in the beginning of the pandemic because of the

low number of cases and deaths. Curiously the CFR for China shows far less
fluctuation in the beginning of the pandemic. Similarly, CFR for country groups A-D
(Figures 4A-D respectively) also show an increasing trend over time with marked
fluctuations within each country, especially in the beginning of the pandemic.
Supplementary Figure 5 shows the trend of CFR on the cutoff date as a function of
case-load in 24 countries with more than 50,000 cases and DP100K >=20, and 3
additional countries with high case loads. The general pattern is that of increasing
CFR with increasing case load. One country (China, Supplementary Figure 5 Inset
A) shows low stable CFR followed by a sharp increase due to late reporting of
previously unreported deaths in this country. The overall pattern suggests that CFR
increases with case load in many countries as the healthcare system, especially
intensive care, becomes overwhelmed (Supplementary Figure 5 Inset B. The United
States has the maximum number of cases but has lower CFR than many countries
with far fewer cases. This could be due to widespread testing and detection of many
more patients with mild or asymptomatic disease but could also be due to the good
quality healthcare infrastructure in United States.

Correlation of CFR with Country-level Indices
Supplementary Table 9 shows the independent association of country-level health,
human development, demographic, economic development and mobility indices with
CFR in countries with case load >/= 1000 using weighted multiple linear regression.
Multicollinearity assumption testing using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) identified
Infant Mortality rate/100,000 live births as being collinear with other indicators and

missing values from 30 countries. Our final model suggests that GDP per capita (β=0.483, p=0.000), hospital beds per population (β=-0.372, p<0.001), mortality from air

pollution (β=-0.487, p=0.003) and population density (β=-0.570, p< 0.000) were
significantly negatively associated while maternal mortality ratio (β=0.431, p=0.000)
and age (β=0.635, p<0.000) were positively associated with CFR. Of note, this
model was able to account for much of the observed variation in CFR (R 2=0.46).

DISCUSSION
Our time series analysis using open source data suggests that the case fatality ratio
of COVID-19 pandemic has increased over the period of its emergence in most
countries and is currently at 3.06% for the aggregate of world data. The CFR of
COVID-19 is twice that of the corresponding CFR (0.4-1.5%) reported by the World
Health Organization for the H1N1 influenza pandemic [12]. The high CFR suggests
that COVID-19 is a severe disease with important public health ramifications. The
CFR has increased in countries with high number of cases as well as in those with
lower case load. The gradually increasing CFR followed by plateau could be a
manifestation of the long duration (2-8 weeks) [13] for COVID-19 related deaths to
manifest in countries which have experienced rapid increase in case load in the past
few months. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 has become more widely available and, in
many countries, is now being offered to patients with less severe disease. This
would be expected to increase the denominator and bring down the CFR and this
may be the reason for the plateau that is becoming apparent in some countries and
country groups.
As expected, the CFR in various countries and groups of countries is variable. This
is likely because of the imbalanced distribution of factors like age and comorbidity
status that impact COVID-19 related mortality and also because of variable
availability of advanced intensive care infrastructure. It is also possible that unknown
host or pathogen related factors are contributing to the variability in CFR. Because

patient level data were not available to adjust potential confounding, we have not
formally, statistically compared the observed CFR between various countries or
clusters of countries. Our analysis suggests that there is a significant positive
correlation between the country-level COVID-19 mortality burden as estimated by
deaths per 100000 population (DP100K) and CFR (Supplementary Figure 1.B), but
we are unable to decipher the presence or predominant direction of causality in this
association. It is possible that CFR could contribute to DP100K, DP100K could
contribute to CFR because of overwhelmed health infrastructure or unknown
variable(s) could contribute to both in the same direction.
Other analyses have reported various figures for CFR of COVID-19 ranging from
less than 1% to more than 10% [7, 14, 15, 16]. Some of these analyses have
reported CFR after accounting for time-lag and other adjustments [17, 18, 19, 20]. It
could be argued that the number of asymptomatic infected individuals is much larger
than the current number of known infections and hence the CFR of COVID-19 is
much lower than is estimated from so-called ‘naïve’ ratio that we have reported.
While it might be true that the number of infected individuals is larger and the CFR
among ‘universal set’ of infected individuals (the so-called infection mortality ratio) is
lower, we would argue that the estimate of greatest interest from a clinical and health
infrastructure perspective is the fraction of deaths among those individuals who are
symptomatic. We would further argue that community level testing of asymptomatic
individuals in the ‘screening’ mode and using that number to calculate CFR deemphasizes the actual severity of the clinical disease.
One particular strength of our analysis is the relatively uniform definition of COVID19 infection in this database, with a large majority being diagnosed by a single
method of polymerase chain reaction. If and when serological tests enter widespread
use and are used to diagnose COVID-19, the analysis of CFR will become more

challenging. Our analysis of CFR as a time trend within countries is robust because
the demographic and other variables within a country remain stable over the period
of this analysis.
Our analysis in countries with heaviest COVID-19 involvement suggests a pattern of
increasing CFR with increasing case load. This is likely due to high stress on the
acute care infrastructure as cases increase. Countries with lesser case load at
present should anticipate this pattern in the near future. This inference is further
strengthened by the significant inverse association of hospital beds per unit
population with CFR in the country-level analysis.
Our country-level analysis suggests that higher resources (higher GDP per capita
and hospitals beds per population) are associated with lower CFR, which attests to
the imperative of supporting countries with lesser resources. Higher age is also
independently associated with CFR which could explain the relatively high fatalities
in some European countries. An enigmatic inverse association in our analysis is with
population density. Many countries with high density are also the ones with lesser
resources and the lower CFR and deaths in these countries, relative to their
population sizes, is as yet unexplained.
There are some limitations of our analysis. We did not account for time- or severitydependent reporting of cases and also for the time-lag in outcomes. It is possible
that COVID-19-related deaths have been underreported in some parts of the world
[21] and that the actual CFR is higher than our estimates. We did not have access to
patient-level data and data of such granularity may never become available for such
a large number of cases and deaths. Therefore, we have been unable to provide
‘adjusted’ CFR after accounting for the distribution of variables. The correlation
between CFR and health and social parameters could possibly be masked or

confounded because the latter were available at the country-level with likely intracountry variation.
In summary, our analysis confirms that COVID-19 is a severe disease in a
considerable minority of patients, its CFR has gradually increased in many parts of
the world, and, given the large number of cases, is likely to result in high absolute
number of deaths unless an effective vaccine or treatment is developed. Our
analysis also indicates that the herd immunity argument is likely inappropriate and
will possibly result in a high number of fatalities. Governments and public health
authorities should consider the CFR among clinically presenting cases and plan
acute care capacity accordingly.

TABLE AND FIGURE LEGENDS
Table 1: The country group wise Case Fatality Ratio, Cases and Death on September 24,
2020 and Daily Mean Percentage Change (Sep 15 to Sep 24, 2020) in CFR. * Rounded to two
decimal points
Figure 1: Study inclusion diagram as of 24 September 2020. 184 countries with at least
one confirmed case of COVID-19 were eligible for this analysis. 157/184 countries had
reported more than 1000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
Figure 2.A: Global Distribution of COVID-19 case fatality ratio on September 24, 2020.
World CFR on 24th September was 3.06. 43 /157 countries report a CFR higher than the world
CFR of 3.06
Figure 2.B: 157 world countries with at least 1000 confirmed covid-19 countries distributed by
their country groups identified using k-means clustering
Figure 3: Case Fatality Ratio of Covid-19 pandemic across the world over time.
Figure 4 A-E: Time trends of case fatality ratio in Country Groups and individual countries in
Group A (Figure 4A), Group B (Figure 4B), Group C (Figure 4C), Group D (Figure 4D) and
Group E (Figure 4E). X-axis
indicates date and Y-axis indicates case fatality ratio. Red line in each Figure is the CFR for
the Group.

Supplementary Figures
Supplementary Figure 1: A) Unsupervised clustering of countries by DP100K of the
population. Log transformed Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) (y-axis) plotted against log
transformed Death per 100,000 of the population (DP100K). Each data point represents the
CFR and DP100K for a country. Clusters are colour coded. B) Linear regression of DP100K
vs CFR for 157 Countries in five cluster group countries. Our model generated an Rsquared of 0.12748 with a standard error of 0.12748 and p-value < 0.0001
Supplementary Figure 2: Elbow plot to identify optimal k for k-means clustering of 157
countries by their DP100K.
Supplementary Figure 3: Violin plots for CFR in five country groups. We excluded CFR for
Yemen as it was an outlier and skewing the results.
Supplementary Figure 4: Percentage distribution of total cases, deaths and active cases
across countries and clusters with respect to their population.
Supplementary Figure 5: CFR as a function of case load. Cumulative cases for a country
are plotted on x axis against the CFR for those cases on y axis. Wherever data is missing
between successive two data points, a rolling average of those two data points is used to join
them with a straight line.
Supplementary Figure 5 (Inset A): CFR as a function of Case Load for countries upto
150,000 cases.
Supplementary Figure 5 (Inset_B): CFR as a function of Case Load for countries upto
500,000 cases.

Supplementary Tables
Supplementary Table 1: Raw data downloaded from the CSSE-JHU github repository on 25th
September 2020 and used for analysis
Supplementary Table 2: 10 country level indices for health, human development, population
demographics and economic development downloaded from the world bank open data hub
repository and the UNO data bank and used for analysis

visualization of CFR trends over time.
Supplementary Table 4: CFR time trends, 95% CI levels and 10 day mean change for
countries in the analysis
Supplementary Table 5: 157 countries clustered on the basis of their log DP100K
Supplementary Table 6: C-H index statistical Model for k-means clustering of 157 countries
by their DP100K
Supplementary Table 7: Wilcoxon-rank test to identify differences in median CFR for all five
country groups
Supplementary Table 8: Cases, deaths and active cases in five country groups and countries
with less than 1000 cases as a percentage of the whole world.
