Abstract (word count: 197)

22

We sought to evaluate the adherence of Vietnamese adults to COVID-19 preventive measures, and

23

gain insight into the effects of the epidemic on the daily lives of Vietnamese people. An online

24

questionnaire survey was organized from March 31 to April 6, 2020. The questionnaire assessed

25

preventive behavior using multiple-answer responses to indicate the extent of adherence. In total,

26

2175 respondents completed the questionnaire (age range: 18–69 years). The mean adherence

27

scores for personal and community preventive measures were 7.23 ± 1.63 (range 1-9) and 9.57 ±

28

1.12 (range 1-11), respectively. Perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown (β=2.64, 95%

29

CI 1.25-4.03), fears/worries concerning one’s health (β=2.87, 95% CI 0.04-5.70), residing in large

30

cities (β=19.40, 95% CI 13.78-25.03), access to official COVID-19 information sources (β=16.45,

31

95% CI 6.82-26.08), and belonging to the healthcare sector (β=22.53, 95% CI 16.00-29.07) were

32

associated with a higher adherence score to anti-COVID instructions. The study indicates excellent

33

preventive behavior of the Vietnamese population which explains the low number of COVID-19

34

infections and zero recorded mortality up to the first week of May 2020. Further monitoring is

35

recommended to assess the sustainability of COVID-19 prevention via behavior change in the

36

medium and long-term.

Introduction

38

In December 2019, an unknown viral pneumonia outbreak erupted in China and has been

39

spreading on a global scale (1). Due to the high likelihood of virus transmission via large droplets

40

and fomites, COVID-19 infection spread rapidly around the planet (2). Preventive public health

41

measures have been implemented to fight the pandemic. Although the strategies applied

42

internationally are similar, the timeliness, scale, and assertiveness of implementation regimes have

43

varied considerably (3).

44

In Vietnam, the first person with a COVID-19 infection was detected on January 23rd and

45

as of May 5th, 2020, Vietnam had totaled 271 confirmed cases with zero deaths (4). Currently

46

Vietnam is among the countries with the lowest number of reported cases, which is remarkable

47

given its population size (approx. 95 million people) and proximity to the epicenter. From the start

48

of the outbreak the government of Vietnam implemented intensive control in the northern Vinh

49

Phuc province (considered to be the local focus of the disease) using a strategy of rapid testing for

50

early detection of sources of infection, assertive contact tracing, timely isolation and free clinical

51

care for people with the infection. Community preventive efforts were implemented early and have

52

been pervasive throughout the country. The government supported social distancing, self-isolation

53

of vulnerable people, mandatory isolation of symptomatic people and those who test positive, focal

54

environmental sanitization, frequent hand washing and wearing of face masks in all public spaces.

55

By February 25th, one month after the first case was recorded, all patients had successfully

56

recovered and had been discharged from hospitals. After more than 20 days with no new case

57

reported, the 17th positive case of COVID-19 was confirmed on March 6th. Another wave of the

58

epidemic hit the country with cases being imported from Europe, the USA, and other countries.

59

This led to an increase in domestic transmission of COVID-19, thus ushering in the second stage

60

of the epidemic. Fortunately, the government and health agencies had pandemic preparedness and

61

control plans in place following the fairly recent experience with fighting SARS, Swine Flu and

62

Avian Influenza. The Government implemented national measures restricting travel and

63

suspended visas for foreigners entering Vietnam. On March 20th, community transmission was

64

indicated when the 86th and 87th COVID-19 patients had no travel history and no apparent contact

65

with COVID-19 patients (4). To further prevent disease spread in the community, on March 31st

66

the Prime Minister mandated urgent measures, including strict social distancing throughout the

67

country for 15 days. Accordingly, all people were required to stay at home, only go out in case of

68

necessity, and keep a minimum distance of at least 2 meters when moving outdoors; shut down all

69

non-essential business activities and services, only allow essential services such as food

70

distribution, non-elective medical procedures, pharmacies store and the fuel supply. In addition,

71

gatherings of more than 2 people were prohibited (5).

72

The primary purpose of this study was to assess how well the people have adhered to these

73

instructions because they are crucial in preventing the spread of the virus. We also sought to

74

investigate the effects of the epidemic on the daily lives of Vietnamese people.

75

Materials and methods

76

Study design

77

We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional survey during which we received voluntary

78

responses continuously for seven consecutive days (from March 31st to April 6th, 2020).

79

Study procedures

80

Data were collected through an online survey initiated by the ICPcovid consortium

81

(https://www.icpcovid.com/). A secure website was used to design and host an online

82

questionnaire, which was adapted to local Vietnamese context. The research team translated the

83

English questionnaire into Vietnamese, conducted a pilot test and improved the questionnaire

84

before official use. It took about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire. The web link to the

85

online questionnaire was disseminated via various social media platforms, and consenting

86

volunteers submitted their information anonymously. The data became available immediately

87

upon submission. The online questionnaire was kept open for one week (recruitment period) after

88

which it was closed and inaccessible.

89

Sample size and sampling

90

Sampling was done using the snow-ball approach: as more persons completed the online

91

questionnaire, they were encouraged to share the survey web link to their contacts. Only data from

92

respondents who self-identified as being at least 18 years old, who were Vietnamese citizens,

93

understood the Vietnamese language, and resided in Vietnam at the time of the study were retained

94

for this analysis.

95

Data collection

96

The first part of the questionnaire gathered socio-demographic information, including

97

participants’ age, gender, profession, urban vs rural residence, religion, educational level, marital

98

status, housing conditions and household composition.

99

Given that our study sought to evaluate the level of adherence to the preventive measures

100

recommended by the government, our study outcomes included the proportions of participants

101

who reported following the lockdown instructions against COVID-19 Yes or No answers were

102

given to show whether the person had followed each guideline during the previous week. Overall

103

adherence was assessed by summing the answers with higher scores reflected higher adherence.

104

We also asked participants to self-report their difficulty in staying home as required during the

105

lockdown, using a 5-point Likert scale (1=not difficult at all to 5 =extremely difficult).

106

Adherence to personal preventive measures was assessed by using 9 questions, covering

107

the following aspects: following the 1.5-2m meters social distance rule; wearing a face mask when

108

outside; avoiding touching the face; covering of mouth and nose when coughing/sneezing; hand

109

hygiene via regular hand washing and/or disinfection with sanitizer; frequency of body

110

temperature check; disinfecting mobile phone frequently.

111

Adherence to community preventive measures was assessed with 11 questions with a

112

focus on the following strategies: avoiding meetings/gatherings; avoiding being in a vehicle/bus

113

with more than 10 persons; avoiding going to crowded entertainment venues/ public gym/ beauty

114

salon; avoiding funeral attendance; avoiding going to a fresh food market; usage of individual

115

spoons and plates when eating together with family/non-family members; avoiding travel to

116

another province/country during the lockdown period.

117

Study covariates

118

In addition to socio-demographic characteristics, data were collected to adjust the observed

119

adherence scores for potential confounders. These items inquired about domestic life and

120

professional activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fears about the participants’ health as well

121

as their family well-being were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1= not worried/afraid to 5=

122

extremely worried/afraid). Similarly, perceived adaptation of the community to lockdown

123

instructed from the government was evaluated via 10-point Likert scale (1= no adaption to 10=

124

very strong adaptation).

125

Ethical Considerations

126

Anonymity and informed consent were assured. The study was approved by the Ethical

127

Review Committee of Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam (No. H202/041 dated

128

March 30th, 2020).

129

Data analysis

130

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0. Descriptive statistics presented

131

continuous data as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while categorical variables were presented as

132

percentages. Adherence to anti-COVID-19 measures was the dependent variable of this study.

133

Multiple linear regression model was used to analyze which independent variables associated with

134

squared-transformed adherence scores. 95% confidence intervals and a p-value of less than 0.05

Results

137

Respondent characteristics and their daily activities

138

A total of 2192 persons completed the online questionnaire. After data cleaning and

139

application of inclusion criteria, 2175 responses were kept. The participants resided in 55/63

140

provinces of Vietnam. 1054 (48.5%) lived in major municipalities (Ha No, Ho Chi Minh City, Hai

141

Phong, Can Tho, and Da Nang) and 1431 (65.8%) lived in smaller urban or rural areas. The mean

142

age was 31.39 years (SD: 10.66, range: 18-69), and the majority of participants (66.9%) were

143

women. The characteristics of our study participants are summarized in Table 1.

148

Most participants said they obtained COVID-19 information through official sources such

149

as state television (81.1%) and the Ministry of Health of Vietnam website (74.5%). Of the 1613

150

participants with a stable job, 777 (48.2%) started working from home because of the epidemic.

151

Confinement measures resulted in 133 (6.1%) participants experiencing difficulties in obtaining

152

food, and 42 (1.9%) persons reported suffering from some form of violence/discrimination because

153

of the restrictive measures taken against COVID-19. Moreover, on a 5-point Likert scale, 30.0%

154

and 42.3% of respondents reported a score of ≥3 indicating that they had moderate to high levels

155

of fear and worry about their own health, and that of their relatives, respectively (Table 2).

184

Summing the responses from self-reports for both personal and community prevention

strategies, produced an overall adherence score up to a maximum of 20. Respondents’ scores

186

ranged from 2 to 20, with a mean of 16.80 ± 2.13. Total adherence scores were squared-

187

transformed to fit a normal distribution and used as the dependent variable in linear regression

models investigating factors associated with adherence to preventive measures (Table 5). We

189

observed that worries about one’s health, perceived adaptation of the community to the lockdown,

190

residence in large municipalities, official sources of Covid-19 information, and having a

Discussion

199

The government of Vietnam took relatively prompt and intensive measures to reduce the

200

spread of COVID-19 infection in Vietnam. Our data show that most Vietnamese people who

201

participated in the survey complied with most strategies to prevent infection. Very few people

202

resisted the orders for using face masks, frequent hand washing, avoiding large gatherings, or

203

proper social distancing. Probably as a consequence of this early intervention and high uptake of

204

protective behaviors, up to the first week of May 2020 the spread has been minimised with only

205

63 new cases since the implementation of strategies for the whole population, and no new cases

206

detected in the community since April 16th, 2020 (6).

207

Most companies/organizations have applied unprecedented working methods in

208

accordance with national efforts to promote working from home. This study found that 48.2% of

209

workers were obliged to work from home during the COVID-19 confinement. Although negative

210

effects of social distancing on people's jobs and lives might emerge if sustained for long periods,

211

the participants in this study indicated relatively few difficulties in the short term, such as meeting

212

daily needs for food.

213

Respondents’ adherence to social distancing measures

214

The survey revealed that many people were moderately to severely worried or afraid about

215

the health risks for family members (42.3%) and this was more than the level of concern about

216

their own health (30.0%). This may reflect the mean age of participants; as most were young adults,

217

they may be concerned about risks to older family members, which is particularly relevant in

218

Vietnam where many people live in multi-generational extended family households.

219

It is common and easy to apply measures such as wearing a mask, washing hands frequently

220

with soap or disinfectant solutions. Although the efficacy of non-medical masks in preventing

COVID-19 spread is currently subject to debate, mask use among infected persons can limit the

222

spread of the virus to the outside environment (7-9). The rate of wearing masks when going out in

223

this study was 99.5%, similar to an estimate of 98% in a Chinese study but higher than 70.1%

224

observed in Japan (9, 10)

225

Two reasons for such high mask use are the fact that the Vietnamese government made

226

mask use mandatory from April 1st, and that in many parts of the country, a majority of the people

227

have a habit of wearing masks to cope with air pollution (5, 11). Although negative social

228

interactions regarding face mask usage have been reported in some parts of the World (12), in

229

Vietnam and some East Asian countries such as China, Japan, and Korea, wearing face masks is

230

ubiquitous (13). It has been practiced for health and cultural reasons (7, 13), so the transition to

231

more widespread mask wearing in response to COVID-19 appears not to have caused a conflict

232

that can sometimes arise if people are forced to change cultural norms.

233

The implementation of community prevention measures was applied very early in response

234

to a localized outbreak in a northern province, and this was re-enforced from April 1st with official

235

implementation of nationwide social distancing. The shutdown nationally has been unprecedented,

236

with all except essential businesses closed (5). People were advised to stay at home as a patriotic

237

act, and only go out when necessary. Information about outbreaks in healthcare, religious

238

gatherings and entertainment facilities was disseminated widely via mainstream and social media

239

(14, 15). In this survey, the item “Avoided going to a fresh market” had the lowest adherence

240

(43.7%), probably because fresh foods are indispensable in the household and also due to the fact

241

there were many women (66.9%) in the sample and women tend most often to procure fresh food

242

in Vietnam. It is worth noting that in the national social distancing regulations, going to the market

243

is a valid reason to leave the house, although people were asked to reduce the frequency of this

244

activity to the bare minimum (5).

245

People living in Municipalities had higher adherence scores, perhaps because about 70%

246

of the COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in cities (16). Many respondents were working as

247

healthcare professionals or were medical students, so they may tend to be more adherent to health

248

protection efforts. Age and gender were not significantly associated with adherence score in this

249

study (Table 5).

250

The high adherence to state recommendations has proven extremely important in the fight

251

against COVID-19 infection. Positive attitudes and compliant behavior indicate that most people

252

in the survey tend to believe in the Government's motives and requirements, showing solidarity

253

and supportive attitudes during the epidemic. According to Berlin-based Dalia Research, 62% of

254

respondents in Vietnam believe the government is doing the “right amount” in response to the

255

COVID-19 pandemic (17); it is therefore not surprising that Vietnam has been internationally

256

recognized for their success in controlling COVID-19 (18). In our study, the proportion of

257

respondents receiving information from reliable sources was high, which showed that most people

258

were careful to avoid unreliable advice and deliberate misinformation. Notably, the Vietnamese

259

government has sanctioned acts that spread fake news (19).

260

There are several limitations of this study. First, the respondents were not a representative

261

sample of the Vietnamese population. Indeed, respondents were mainly people from medium to

262

high social strata, since poor and vulnerable populations in Vietnam may have limited internet

263

access. The snowball sampling method and recruitment over just one week possibly explains the

264

high proportion of health professionals and health science students. Random sampling of the

265

population is necessary. Second, it is not possible to verify the veracity of responses provided via

266

a web-based questionnaire. Third, the cross-sectional study design provided only a snapshot of

267

preventive behaviour over one week. It will be important to monitor adherence to official

268

recommendations over time as societies adapt to changing conditions throughout the unpredictable

269

course of this pandemic.

270

Conclusion

271

The study provides insight into compliance with the social distancing and other risk

272

mitigation measures implemented in Vietnam in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall,

273

adherence to government instructions was high and most likely played a role in rapidly controlling

274

the epidemic in Vietnam and limiting its public health impact. On April 27th the strict lockdown

275

measures were stopped and life is gradually returning to normal in Vietnam, albeit with a stronger

276

than usual emphasis on personal protection during social interactions. Careful monitoring for

277

potential new imported COVID infections and community transmission will be needed to prevent

278

a resurgence of the epidemic.
