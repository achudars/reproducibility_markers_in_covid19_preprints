Improved performance of saliva for the detection of the B.1.351

variant in South Africa

Abstract:

5

Assessment of the unknown performance of saliva for the detection of the novel

6

SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.351 (501Y.V2) lineage is essential as

7

saliva has been shown to be an equivalent, less invasive and a less costly

8

alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for the molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2

9

infection in pre-variant studies. Between 1st August 2020 and 16th January 2021, we

10

enrolled 410 eligible ambulatory participants who presented to Groote Schuur

11

Hospital (GSH) in Cape Town, South Africa for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of these, 300

12

were enrolled prior to, and 110 after, the initial detection and replacement of wild-

13

type by the B.1.351 variant. All participants provided a supervised self-collected mid-

14

turbinate (MT) and saliva (SA) swab, in addition to the standard HCW collected NP

15

swab which were all tested by RT-PCR in an accredited diagnostic laboratory.

16

Positive percent agreement to NP swab for SA swabs pre- and post-variant were

17

51.5% and 72.5% respectively while these values for MT swabs were 75.8% and

18

77.5%. The negative percent agreement for all swab types during all periods was

19

>98%. The basis for this marked improvement of SA swabs as a diagnostic sample

20

for B.1.351 virus is still being investigated.

Body:

23

In December 2020, South Africa (SA) faced a surge in COVID-19 cases, which was

24

associated with the replacement of previous circulating lineages with a novel SARS-

25

CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.351 (501Y.V2) lineage1. Preliminary analyses

26

suggest that this variant, defined by 3 mutations at key sites in the receptor-binding

27

domain, may have functional significance including increased transmissibility1. In the

28

assessment of multiple diagnostic sample types to reduce the need for directed

29

healthcare worker (HCW) performed sampling, saliva has been shown to be

30

equivalent, safer and a less costly alternative to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for

31

molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection2,3. Its performance in the detection

32

of VOC virus is, however, unknown.

33
34

Between 1st August 2020 and 16th January 2021, we enrolled 410 eligible ambulatory

35

participants who presented to Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH) in Cape Town, South

36

Africa for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of these, 300 were enrolled prior to, and 110 after,

37

the initial detection and replacement of the B.1.351 variant. All participants provided

38

a supervised self-collected mid-turbinate (MT) and saliva (SA) swab, in addition to

39

the standard HCW collected NP swab which were tested by RT-PCR4 in an

40

accredited diagnostic laboratory. Assessment of the diagnostic validity of MT and SA

41

relative to NP swabs (Fig. 1A) was assessed by comparing the mean cycle threshold

42

(Ct) differences (Fig. 1B and C), pre-test probability (Fig 1D). Whole genome

43

sequencing of suitable specimens (Fig. 1E), was performed.

44
45

Notably, a noted improvement in the positive percent agreement (PPA) for SA but

46

not MT relative to NP swabs, for the two cohorts was documented. The reasons for

47

the significant change in SA PPA are currently unknown. Possibilities include

48

changes in tissue tropism5 associated with the VOC B.1.351, and while increased

49

viral replication in salivary glands would be expected to decrease the mean Ct value

50

to a greater extent than for NP swabs post B.1.351 lineage emergence, this was not

51

evident. However, a potential explanation would be the presence of greater RNA

52

quantities of VOC B.1.351 reflected by decreased mean Ct values for all sample

53

types, which may support the preliminary modelling-based finding of increased

54

transmissibility1. Whilst altered test-seeking behavior in the study population cannot

55

be excluded the inclusion criteria remained the same throughout the study.

56
57

Whilst further WGS studies are ongoing to determine compartmentalized replication

58

and to inform diagnostic preferences concurrent to public health interventions,

59

knowledge of distinct oral and oropharyngeal shedding dynamics and viral burden

60

through the continuum of SARS-CoV-2 infections is warranted.

as well as positive and negative predictive value of saliva (SA) and mid-turbinate

66

(MT) self-administered swabs as a diagnostic sample for SARS-CoV-2 PCR prior to

67

(n=33/300) and after (n=40/107) the emergence of the B.1.351 lineage. Post-

68

emergence, 3 proven non-B.1.351 lineage virus infected participants were excluded.

The likelihood ratio of having a positive SA swab result pre- and post-emergence of

the B.1.351 lineage for participants with a positive NP swab result was 34 and 48

71

respectively. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Wilson-Brown method.

3.39 and a comparable 2.47 and 3.28 for MT and NP, respectively. Paired t-tests

80

were used to compare swab Ct values. *: P-value < 0.05, **: P-value <0.01, ***: P-
