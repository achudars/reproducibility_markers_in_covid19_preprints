Extensions of the SEIR Model for the Analysis of
Tailored Social Distancing and Tracing Approaches
to Cope with COVID-19
Veronika Grimm1,2 , Friederike Mengel3,4 , Martin Schmidt5
Abstract. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide
face the challenge of designing tailored measures of epidemic control to provide
reliable health protection while allowing societal and economic activity. In
this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to
enable a detailed analysis of commonly discussed tailored measures of epidemic
control—among them group-specific protection and the use of tracing apps. We
introduce groups into the SEIR model that may differ both in their underlying
parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public health interventions.
Moreover, we allow for different infectiousness parameters within and across
groups, different asymptomatic, hospitalization, and lethality rates, as well as
different take-up rates of tracing apps. We then examine predictions from these
models for a variety of scenarios. Our results visualize the sharp trade-offs
between different goals of epidemic control, namely a low death toll, avoiding
overload of the health system, and a short duration of the epidemic. We show
that a combination of tailored mechanisms, e.g., the protection of vulnerable
groups together with a “trace & isolate” approach, can be effective in preventing
a high death toll. Protection of vulnerable groups without further measures
requires unrealistically strict isolation. A key insight is that high compliance is
critical for the effectiveness of a “trace & isolate” approach. Our model allows
to analyze the interplay of group-specific social distancing and tracing also
beyond our case study in scenarios with a large number of groups reflecting, e.g.,
sectoral, regional, or age differentiation and group-specific behavioral responses.

1. Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic challenges nations worldwide. Since the end of
January 2020, many nations around the world have locked down significant parts of
their social and economic activities to slow down infection rates. The main goal not
to overburden the health system has been achieved with varying degrees of success
across countries.
While a lockdown is an effective first reaction to the pandemic, it is obvious
that it also comes at significant social and economic costs. Economic forecasts for
Germany predict a gross domestic product (GDP) reduction of between 4 and 7 %
(approx. 150–260 billion Euros) as compared to 2019 caused by the first month of
lockdown only. Beyond the direct economic damage, significant social costs arise in
terms of the consequences of unemployment, a sharp increase in the education gap,
mental health problems and shorter life expectations due to reduced physical and
mental health.
Against this background, one of the most important debates currently is how
to overcome lockdowns in a way that maintains a high level of health protection
and, in particular, does not overburden the health system. Tailored packages of
measures can include (i) protection of risk groups, (ii) suppression of the spread

of the virus by legal requirements on protective measures, (iii) suppression of the
transmission of the virus by maintaining certain social distancing requirements, (iv)
regionally differentiated restarts of social and economic activities, and finally, (v)
the improvement of digitalization in the health sector and the use of tracing apps
and isolation of potentially infected individuals.
One of the challenges for designing appropriate policies, besides the poor availability of reliable data, is that standard epidemiological approaches do not model
key elements of these public health interventions. In this paper, we propose an
extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to enable the analysis of commonly
discussed measures of epidemic control in more detail. We introduce different groups
that may differ both in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral
response to public health interventions. In particular, we allow the infectiousness
parameters to differ within and across groups, which enables the detailed analysis
of group-specific measures. Moreover, groups may have different asymptomatic,
hospitalization, and lethality rates. Within this framework, we are able to analyze
social distancing measures within groups, specific protection of groups with high
lethality rates, as well as the detailed effects of “trace & isolate” strategies with
different levels of take-up of the tracing apps needed in this context.
In a case study for the German population, we study predictions of our model
using parameter estimates from the existing literature in a variety of different
scenarios [1–5]. We have to mention at this point that while a lot of experience
has been gained over the past year, reliable estimates are not yet available for all
parameters. Our model can easily be applied to new and more reliable data sets, as
they emerge, as well as richer scenarios with, e.g., a larger number of groups and
case studies can be updated as new data become available. On the other hand, our
model and results also provide guidance on which parameters are key to be identified
reliably in order to analyze the effectiveness of epidemic control approaches in more
detail.
Several robust insights emerge from our case study. Our results highlight the
sharp trade-off between different goals of epidemic control, namely keeping the
death toll as low as possible, limiting the duration of the epidemic, i.e., the time
until “enough” immunity exists in the population, and managing intensive care unit
(ICU) capacity. We further show that protection of vulnerable groups is effective
even if it is applied in a mild form as long as it is implemented in combination with
tracing. If tracing is not used together with protection of vulnerable groups, only
strict isolation of those groups can effectively prevent a high death toll. Such very
strict isolation may be socially undesirable. We also show that compliance is very
important for the effectiveness of a “trace & isolate” approach. Tracing is almost
completely ineffective unless compliance is high, which in our case study means that
at least 70 % of the population install and use tracing apps effectively. Crucially,
the “critical” compliance rate can be brought down substantially when vulnerable
groups are protected.
Our results suggest that an opening strategy can be effectively supported by the
use of apps if they are made mandatory in places where more interaction is allowed.
This seems possible at many workplaces and, e.g., in educational institutions, but is
probably not effectively applicable in public life in general. Against this background,
maintaining group-specific social distancing measures seems inevitable also in the
medium run. Our model can be used to study such group-specific measures flexibly
for any partition of the population and we re-iterate that any policy conclusion
should continually be revised as new and improved data become available. It is also
important to note that data protection aspects in connection with tracing apps must
be carefully considered, especially as we have seen that high compliance is absolutely

essential. Last, extensive digitalization of the health care and the registration system
is an indispensable prerequisite for the effective use of a “trace & isolate” approach.
The reason is that quarantine of contact persons has to be ordered quick enough to
effectively break infection chains.
Epidemiological models such as the classic SIR and SEIR models have been
widely applied to model the current crisis (see, e.g., [6–14]) and sometimes have
been fitted to the scarce data available [15, 16]. A number of papers have studied
public health interventions within the SIR/SEIR models. Most of them focused on
social distancing [8, 10, 11]. In general, social distancing is found to be very effective
in suppressing the disease in the short run in these models including age-structured
and location-specific models [8, 17]. Other interventions have been studied less and,
if so, in unstructured models assuming a homogeneous population [18]. Among
those, testing and quarantining is seen as a promising tool to control the epidemic [7,
19], though there is widespread awareness of the difficulty of implementing these
measures with limited testing capacity and a potentially high asymptomatic rate [3].
Because of this, contact tracing is considered key, but thought to be difficult for
COVID-19 and other coronaviruses; see, e.g., [18, 20]. Recent research argues
that viral spread is too fast for manual contact tracing in the case of COVID-19
and emphasizes that compliance is critical for the effectiveness of contact-tracing
apps [18]. In [21], the authors point out that compliance is also crucial for policies
encouraging social distancing. They find that it is essential that a reduction of
social activity is implemented robustly on all social groups, especially on those
characterized by intense mixing patterns.
One of the contributions of our research is to model the behavioral response,
specifically concerning compliance with respect to the use of tracing apps and
self-isolation. Our model can furthermore capture sectoral or regional heterogeneity
in underlying parameters and infection rates. These properties are also interesting
with regard to integration into macroeconomic models, which, e.g., are investigated
in [22] or [23].
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model
and Section 3 outlines the scenarios and the parameterization of our case study.
Section 4 reports the results of our case study and Section 5 concludes.
2. The Models
To model the COVID-19 epidemic together with the key aspects of the related
political and societal discussion such as the effect of lockdown strategies or tracing
apps, we extend the classic SEIR model; see, e.g., [24]. This nonlinear system of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describes the dynamics of the transitions
between four different compartments: susceptible (S(t)), exposed (E(t)), infectious
(I(t)), and recovered (R(t)) individuals. The ODE system is given by

Moreover, it holds S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = 1 for all t, i.e., these functions
represent fractions of the entire group of considered individuals. Thus, it holds
(S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t))N = N , where N is the total population size. Note
that the group of recovered people also contains deaths in this model. The basic
reproduction number is R0 = β/γ, which can be thought of as the expected number
of cases generated by one case in the model. Table 1 summarizes the notation for
the SEIR model.

2.1. An Extended SEIR Model: SEI3 RD. The classic SEIR model (1) is now
extended to distinguish (i) between different groups such as old and young people,
or vulnerable and non-vulnerable individuals, (ii) between different categories of
infectiousness (asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe cases), and (iii) between
recovered and dead people. Being able to explicitly distinguish these different groups
is important as they can greatly differ in terms of their underlying parameters as
well as in terms of their behavioral response to public health interventions.
First, we consider different groups k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. The total number of individuals in group k is denoted with Nk . Groups may differ in multiple characteristics
such as age, gender, location, profession, immunity status, etc. The compartments
S, E, I, and R are thus split up into Sk , Ek , Ik , and Rk for all k. In our analysis,
we also capture specific aspects that are needed to analyze a variety of strategies
to slow down an epidemic. We explicitly capture that, across groups, different
fractions of infectious individuals show symptoms of the infection. We denote the
fraction (of Ik ) of asymptomatic individuals Ikasym in group k by ηk ∈ (0, 1). Thus,
1 − ηk is the fraction of infectious individuals that are symptomatic. Among those
symptomatic individuals, a fraction νk ∈ (0, 1) suffers a severe course of the disease
and is assumed to need intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, while a fraction (1 − νk )
is symptomatic without the need for intensive care. We denote the group of severely
symptomatic infectious by Iksev and the symptomatic individuals without a severe
course of infection by Iksym . Out of the severely symptomatic infectious individuals
in Iksev , a certain fraction σk will not survive. The lethality rate σk is group-specific
and endogenous, i.e., it depends on the availability of ICU beds and the number
of severe cases. We denote the lethality rate given a severely ill patient in group k
has access to an ICU bed by σ̂k . The lethality rate increases endogenously as ICU
capacity is exhausted; see Equation (3) below.
In our model, individuals infect other individuals with a certain probability. This
probability, modeled via contact rates as in the classic SEIR model, is affected by
various aspects, e.g., how likely people meet or whether they show symptoms of
the infection. Our model allows for individuals from Ikasym , Iksym , and Iksev to have
different probabilities, depending on their category of infectiousness as well as their

group membership. We denote the contact rate between symptomatic individuals

asym
of group k and individuals of group j by βkj
, and by βkj
the corresponding
contact rate for infectious but asymptomatic individuals. Finally, we also model
potentially group-specific average durations of the infection for the symptomatic
and severely ill individuals. By contrast, we assume that the average infectious
period of asymptomatically infectious individuals is the same across groups.
It is important to note that individuals may start out with an asymptomatic
infection but then develop symptoms after a few days or they might initially show
only mild symptoms but then develop severe symptoms after several days. We do
not explicitly model the transition between these categories, but note that a model
extension that would do so is straightforward. In the current model the classes Ikasym
, Iksym and Iksev should be interpreted as the expected size of each group at any given
point in time. Hence the average infectious period of, for example, symptomatic
infectious individuals relates to the time since they became symptomatic.

Equation (2a) describes the change in the number of susceptible individuals in
group k over time. Equation (2b) is the change in the number of exposed individuals
in group k and εk is inversely proportional to the incubation period for individuals
in group k. Exposed individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious. As
specified in Equations (2c)–(2e) we distinguish between asymptomatically (“asym”),
symptomatically (“sym”) infectious and severely affected (“sev”) individuals.
A key aspect of the SEI3 RD model is that the lethality rates σk (t) are endogenous
and time-dependent. We assume that, without hospitalization, all individuals with a
severe course of the disease die. The number of ICU beds provided by the healthcare
system is denoted by B. The probability of death and recovery, respectively, depends
of the number of free beds in relation to severe cases and also on the selection
mechanism that determines who is getting a free bed. We assume that the free beds
are rationed proportionally across groups. A different rationing mechanism might
be interesting to look at if one is interested in the age structure of the dead or if one
wants to analyze the effect of different triage mechanisms that imply preferential
treatment, e.g., for young people. Those extensions are easily possible by modifying
of Equation (3). Then, σk is endogenously determined from the lethality rate σ̂k of
patients with a severe infection who have access to ICU care as follows,
(
σ̂k ,
if Iksev (t)Nk ≤ Bk ,
σk (t) = σ̂k Bk +Iksev (t)Nk −Bk
(3)
, if Iksev (t)Nk > Bk ,
I sev (t)Nk
k

where Bk = (Nk /N )B is the number of ICU beds available to group k. The
endogenous lethality rate is then finally used in Equations (2f) and (2g) to model
the dynamics of the compartments of recovered and dead individuals.
There has been quite some discussion about whether COVID-19 will eventually
become seasonal like many other coronaviruses. While our model currently does
not allow for seasonality, it can be extended to allow for seasonality or other time
heterogeneity in parameters in the same way as the classical SEIR model can be
extended to allow for such factors. Both [25] or the literature review in [26] provide
good examples of how such seasonality can be modeled.
2.2. The SEI3 Q3 RD Model: An Extended SEI3 RD Model to Capture
the Effect of Tracing Apps to Break Infection Chains. In the following, we
extend the SEI3 RD model to be able to analyze a policy to reduce the number of
infected individuals by the widespread introduction of tracing apps. These apps allow

to break infection chains by sending infected individuals to quarantine (Q) before
they can spread the virus further. Here, we assume that a fraction ψk of individuals
in group k uses such a tracing app effectively. An infection chain can be broken
if both, the carrier and the recipient of the virus, use a tracing app “effectively”,
meaning that the recipient of the virus can be sent to quarantine before he or she is
infectious (i.e., enters one of the groups in compartment I). This obviously depends
on individual compliance in downloading and using the app but it may also depend
on the effectiveness of the health system to contact potentially infected people and
send them into quarantine, i.e., on the speed of notification etc. Also note that the
fraction of the population that uses tracing apps may vary across groups due to
acceptance, ability, or availability of a smart phone. We model the impact of tracing
by splitting the compartment E consisting of individuals in the incubation period.
In particular, we assume that, as a spreader of the virus, only individuals that are
aware of their infection (symptomatic or severely infectious) can be recognized by
the health authorities and can contribute to break infection chains if they use the
app effectively. This applies to a fraction ψk of group k. All their contacts who also
use the app (fraction ψ` ) will be identified. Thus, when individuals from groups k
and ` meet, then ψk ψ` of the infected individuals are “traced” and enter Ektr , while
the remaining infected individuals are “not traced” and enter Eknt . We model the
fact that infected individuals who are identified through contact tracing are sent
into quarantine by splitting the group of infectious individuals further into I and
Q. All individuals from Ektr enter compartments Q when they become infectious
while all individuals from Eknt enter compartments I. While the individuals in I are
actively infecting other individuals over time, those in Q do not. Individuals from
Ikasym , Iksym , Qasym
, and Qsym
enter the recovered compartment Rk after potentially

2.3. Numerical Solution Approach. The presented SEI3 RD and SEI3 Q3 RD
models are nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations. We solved these
systems using an explicit Euler scheme in time (see, e.g., [27]) with an equidistant
step size of 10−2 . Both the models and the ODE solver are implemented in
Python 3.7.4 using the NumPy package. The code and all data to reproduce the
results presented in this paper is publicly available at the GitHub repository under
https://github.com/m-schmidt-math-opt/covid-19-extended-seir-model.
3. Scenarios
We use our models to analyze several widely discussed scenarios and provide
evidence on their effectiveness. We provide two benchmarks (laissez-faire and uniform
social distancing) and then analyze several variants of more sophisticated epidemic
control approaches. The approaches we analyze include (i) specific protection
of vulnerable groups, (ii) the use of tracing apps to break infection chains, and
combinations of the two. With respect to tracing apps, we consider different take-up
(or compliance) rates. All scenarios are also analyzed under different assumptions
concerning the asymptomatic rate and the lethality of the virus.
3.1. First Scenario: Benchmark. We first consider a benchmark scenario in
which no measures are taken. We use estimates of β, γ, and σ from the literature. In
particular, we assume that the values of β within and across groups induce a basic
reproduction number R0 between 2.2 and 3. This is the range of typical estimates
for COVID-19 [2, 28].
3.2. Second Scenario: Uniform Social Distancing. As a second benchmark
we consider a standard social distancing scenario in which β is uniformly lowered
within and across all groups to a value β SD . We calibrate our model to reach an
effective reproductive number of between 0.5 and 1.5 under social distancing in our
different scenarios.
3.3. Third Scenario: Group-Specific Social Distancing. The third policy
that we analyze is to target β differently within and across groups. This could,
e.g., reflect a policy to largely protect groups that are at risk by implementing
measures to lower transmission involving this group. In our parameterization,
the vulnerable group is characterized by having a higher conditional probability
of a severe course of the disease (modeled using the parameter ν) and a higher
conditional lethality rate among ICU patients (parameter σ̂). Protection policies for
such vulnerable groups are particularly focused on keeping all β’s low that involve

this group. Interactions within the less vulnerable group can be less restricted. One
question we will ask is how much one can allow βLL , which measures transmission
within the low vulnerability group, to increase while at the same time not having
to lower the remaining β’s too much and still achieve the same effect on overall
lethality as under uniform social distancing.
3.4. Fourth Scenario: Trace and Isolate. The third widely discussed policy is
to reduce the number of infectious individuals I by the widespread use of tracing
apps that allow to break infection chains. This scenario assumes that a fraction ψk
of individuals in group k uses such tracing apps. The app continuously registers
contact persons that an individual comes close to in the context of interactions.
Once an individual is tested positively for COVID-19, the individual is free to give
the health administration permission to use this data to contact all individuals that
have potentially been infected. We assume that all individuals that use the app also
agree to the use of their data and that the health office’s procedures are fast enough
to actually break the infection chain for all individuals that use the app. This means,
in particular, that potentially infected individuals are effectively isolated, i.e., sent
to self-quarantine until a test can verify their infection status as positive or negative.
Note that the fraction of the population that uses tracing apps may vary across
groups due to acceptance, ability, or availability of a smart phone. Note also that
the compliance rate can also be interpreted as to reflect the effectiveness of the
health system or other aspects that reduce the effectiveness of the app.
As multidimensional policies of infection control we finally also analyze combinations of the measures taken in the third and fourth scenario.
3.5. Parameterization. We now describe the parameterization for our case study
in more detail. Our case study is modeled to reflect the German situation with a
population of about 83 million people. We classify around 17 million people as “high
risk”. This approximately corresponds to the share of people aged 65 or older in
Germany. Of course some older people are not at high risk, while some younger
people with certain health conditions are. The reason to focus on age is (i) that
existing data are clear on that age is a very important risk factor and (ii) age, and
specifically protection of the elderly, has played an important role in policy debate.
We also emphasize that the aim of the case study is to demonstrate the potential
of the modeling approach to provide important insights on the effectiveness of various
sophisticated mechanisms of epidemic control. Those mechanisms are important in
general to combine effective health protection with social and economic activities.
The exact design of the mechanisms will of course depend on the specific situation at
hand. A consideration of specific scenarios, with potentially more groups and more
accurate parameters is not the focus of this paper, but a possible application of the
model. Let us also note that, up to now, we face significant uncertainty concerning
key parameters that will drive results and affect policy conclusions.
We now motivate our parameter choices by discussing preliminary evidence on
COVID-19 from the very recent literature. If no measures of epidemic control are
taken, it is estimated that the basic reproduction number R0 is somewhere between 2
and 3; see the report [29] by the European Center for Disease Control.
Typical estimates are 3 (reported in [1]), 2.3 (reported in [2]) or 2.26 (reported in
[28]). For Germany, the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) estimated R0 to be between 2.4
and 3.3 in April [30]. The social distancing measures introduced under lockdown
measures across Europe are estimated to induce an effective reproduction number
of somewhere between 0.5 and 1. For Germany the RKI estimated R = 0.9 with a
95 % confidence interval between 0.8 and 1.1 [30] during the April lockdown. We

chose values for our social distancing scenarios that cover this range of estimates
and allow also for some milder and some stricter forms of social distancing.
Estimates for the share of asymptomatic infections range from 0.18 on the Princess
Diamond cruise-ship, i.e., in a sample of mostly elderly people, see [3], to 0.86 for
China [4].
When infected, the incubation period is typically thought to have a median of 5
days—although it can be much faster. The duration of the infection period (after
the incubation period and before recovery or death) varies between 7 and 18 days
or potentially even longer in severe cases. The severity of COVID-19 differs widely
across age groups with less than 1 % of infected under 10 years old being hospitalized
but over 15 % aged over 70 needing hospital treatment [5]. Only a subset of the
hospitalized need ICU treatment. Based on existing data from Germany [31] we
estimate that percentage at around 30 %.
Estimates for conditional lethality vary greatly across existing studies. However,
they all highlight a great deal of variation around age. In [32], the authors estimate
overall lethality rates of 2.3 % for China (and of over 6 % at that early stage for
Italy), ranging from 0.2 % for those under 40 years of age to 14.8 % for those above
80 years of age. [33] study how the age distribution contributes to different lethality
rates across countries. In their data overall lethality ranges from 0.7% in Germany
to 9.3% in Italy. They find that adjusting for age explains around 66% of the
variation across countries with a resulting median lethality rate of 1.9%. The overall
lethality rate implied by our parameterization is somewhat lower than these numbers
taking into account the lower estimates for Germany and the fact that it is based
on all symptomatic individuals and not just on officially recorded cases. In a big
observational study from hospital patients in Germany during the first wave [31]
the authors find that conditional on ventilation mortality ranges from 28% for those
aged 18-59 years to 72% for those over 80 years of age. Lethality is substantially
lower among those hospitalized who are not ventilated.
For our simulations, we split the population in two groups. One group is assumed
to be composed out of people having a high risk of a severe course of the infection,
the other group having a lower risk. We systematically vary the parameters β, η,
σ̂, and ψ to gain insights into the effect of social distancing, the protection of the
vulnerable group, the impact of the asymptomatic rate, and the effect of the use of
a tracing app to break infection chains. Apart from this, all scenarios are based on
the parameterization given in Table 3, which summarizes our fixed parameters.
Table 4 shows the parameters that change across the various scenarios that we
simulate. Parameter values are chosen to be in line with estimates of the basic
reproduction number and to cover interesting cases. We will further motivate specific

parameter choices in the course of the presentation of our results. In the benchmark
(B) and the uniform social distancing (USD) scenarios, we have chosen uniform β
parameters across groups. For the group-specific social distancing (GSD) scenarios,
we split the population in a vulnerable and a non-vulnerable group and choose
different β parameters for interactions that involve the vulnerable group and those
that do not. We moreover vary the lethality rates and the asymptomatic rates to
gain some insights into the sensitivity of the results.
4. Results
This section contains the results and discussion of our simulation outcomes. In
order to first draw the bigger picture, we present two selected scenarios that illustrate
extreme cases, the scenarios B2 and USD2 (see Table 4). Scenario B2 represents
a situation without any measures of epidemic control and a reproduction rate of
R ≈ 2.6. Scenario USD2 assumes thorough social distancing leading to an effective
reproduction rate R ≈ 1. Note that since asymptomatically, symptomatically, and
severely infectious individuals can have different recovery rates in our model, R
changes over time as the relative frequency of these groups in the population changes.

This is why the values of R we indicate are only approximations. The course of the
epidemic in the two scenarios is presented in Figure 1 with days since the start of
the epidemic on the x-axis and number of individuals on the y-axis. Note that for
both scenarios we show group-specific outcomes for a group with high vulnerability
(H) and a group with low vulnerability (L). Here and in what follows, we define the
duration of the epidemic as the number of days until the number of severe cases is
below 5 % of ICU capacity and where at the same time the share of the population
in the susceptible category is below 1/R0 .

Figure 1. Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic for the B2 (left)
and the USD2 (right) scenario: Susceptible individuals in green,
recovered in blue, and aggregated asymptomatic, symptomatic, and
severely infectious cases in orange. The group with low vulnerability
has dotted curves, the group with high vulnerability is plotted
solidly.
Figure 1 (left) illustrates that without any intervention, the epidemic is quickly
over but claims many lives. In particular, due to the rapid exponential spread of
the epidemic in scenario B2, about 80 % of the population has gone through the
infection after only 247 days. At this point, only about 20 % of the population remain
susceptible. Due to the fact that the health system’s ICU capacity is exceeded for
140 days during the epidemic, more than 500 000 individuals die. Due to scaling,
this is not visualized in Figure 1 but we discuss the details in Section 4.1.
By contrast, under social distancing, see Figure 1 (right), the epidemic lasts
far longer than 500 days. After the first 500 days, 92 % of the population is still
susceptible. On the positive side, the health system’s capacity is always sufficient
and only 26 000 individuals die. On the negative side, the epidemic has not been
overcome: The situation faced by society after 500 days is similar to the one on day
zero.
These figures clearly illustrate that both options are no realistic alternatives
for a society to deal with the epidemic in the medium run. Scenario B2 implies
an unbearable situation for society, while USD2 does not solve but preserve the
problem, with the solution still pending and the economy shut down with all
the associated problems. In the following, we thus discuss these two and other
benchmark scenarios (Section 4.1) and social distancing scenarios (Section 4.2).
We then illustrate what our model can contribute to the understanding of the
effectiveness of more sophisticated and tailored approaches of epidemic control. In
particular, we focus on group-specific social distancing (Section 4.3) and the effect
of tracing apps (Section 4.4), as well as combinations of the two.
4.1. Benchmark. We first analyze three benchmark scenarios in which we assume
that no epidemic control takes place. For details and exact parameterizations see

Table 4. Scenario B1 is characterized by a high reproduction number (on average
R ≈ 3) and a low asymptomatic rate of 25 % for both groups. In B2, R ≈ 2.6 and
otherwise the parameters are identical to B1. In B3, R ≈ 2.2 and the L group has a
higher asymptomatic rate of 50 %. Each model is run using varying assumptions on
lethality rates; see Table 4.
For each model, we report in Table 5 the death toll within the first 500 days of
the epidemic, the number of days in which ICU capacity is exceeded, the duration
of the epidemic, and the fraction of susceptible individuals after 500 days.

In line with other studies [9, 10, 34], our results suggest that the epidemic will
claim a large number of lives if left unchecked. In our simulations, ICU capacity
would be exceeded for between three and five months and the death toll would
be anywhere between 240 000 to over half a million lives. Because of these and
similar results we have seen social distancing implemented all over Europe in the
last few months. Against this background, the next section addresses various social
distancing scenarios.
4.2. Uniform Social Distancing. As a second benchmark we consider three
uniform social distancing scenarios. Uniform social distancing means that all
interactions in the population are reduced to the same extent. Among our three
scenarios, USD1 represents a case of mild social distancing with an average effective
reproduction number of R ≈ 1.5. All parameters but the contact rates β are identical
to B3. In this scenario, the epidemic is slowed down but the number of cases is still
increasing during the first 500 days. Scenario USD2 has R ≈ 1, i.e., also here the
disease is progressing, but more slowly. Scenario USD3 suppresses the disease with
R ≈ 0.6, which is at the lower end of the estimates of the effective reproductive
number during the recent/current lockdowns in Europe.

Under mild social distancing (USD1) the epidemic progresses slowly. ICU capacity
is slightly exceeded over a period of at most 11 days, but there is still a death toll of
over 120 000 in the first 500 days. After 500 days, a large share of the population is
still susceptible and, moreover, it is unknown, given current evidence, whether those
who passed through the illness early on are still immune after 500 days. In USD2
and USD3, social distancing is effective to suppress the epidemic with the effect
that the number of deaths in the first 500 days is comparatively low. However, in
these scenarios, the vast majority of the population (up to 99 %) is still susceptible

after 500 days. Hence, especially in USD2 and USD3, the death toll will further
increase after 500 days until a vaccine is widely available. Note also that all our
uniform social distancing scenarios are based on the benchmark scenario B3, which
assumes a higher asymptomatic rate among the group with low vulnerability. In
the case of a lower asymptomatic rate (comparison to B2), there are more deaths
in the first 500 days. Other than that the results are very similar. Suppression
is unlikely to be an effective long term strategy and, in the absence of a widely
available vaccine, alternatives need to be considered. This is what we focus on in
the next two sections.
4.3. Group-Specific Social Distancing. Our group-structured model allows us
to study non-uniform social distancing measures, which are designed to induce
different within-group and across-group contact rates. This could allow to explicitly
protect vulnerable groups (as shown in our case study) or to design tailored social
distancing measures that allow particularly desirable or important economic and
societal activities while suppressing others. This means, groups could be defined by
sector, age, region, or otherwise.
In this part of our case study we focus on one particular split, which has received
much attention in recent policy discussions in which the idea is to protect vulnerable
groups. We hence split the population in the 20 % most vulnerable and the rest of
the population. The 20 % most vulnerable individuals are those most likely to have
a severe course of the disease. It has been shown that mostly age, but also gender
and certain health conditions, are strong predictors of the severity of COVID-19. Of
course, it is also possible to split the population in other ways and, e.g., to protect
the most vulnerable 25 or 30 %.
The scenarios we discuss here build on our benchmark scenarios B2 and B3.
We then either reduce only contact rates for interactions that affect individuals
with high vulnerability (H) or reduce all contact rates but to a different extent.
The first approach corresponds to a strategy to resume life as usual except for the
vulnerable, who are then severely protected. The second approach corresponds to
the establishment of general protection measures also in daily life, with particular
protective measures applied to vulnerable individuals. GSD1 builds on benchmark B2,
but then drastically reduces all interactions involving highly vulnerable individuals,
i.e., contact rates to βHH = βLH = βHL = 0.04. This roughly corresponds to an
effective reproduction number of R ≈ 0.6 generated from these interactions only.
GSD2 also restricts all interactions involving the highly vulnerable population to
β = 0.04 but corresponds to B3 in all other parameters, i.e., in particular assumes
a lower contact rate βLL from interactions among the less vulnerable. GSD3 is a
scenario where both groups engage in social distancing but to a different extent,
with LL-interactions restricted to βLL = 0.11 and all other interactions restricted to
βHH = βLH = βHL = 0.08. Otherwise, the parameters in GSD3 are identical to GSD2
and B3. Table 7 reports the results for these three scenarios.

unrestricted). However, despite the extreme protection of vulnerable people in this
scenario, ICU capacity is exceeded for 125 days and the death toll is still high
(around 160 000 deaths). If the interactions involving the less vulnerable (LL) have
somewhat lower contact rates (as in GSD2), we observe a lower death toll and ICU
capacity is exceeded on fewer days (around 55 days). Still, there are 75 000 deaths,
which is about an 85 % reduction compared to scenario B2 in which vulnerable
people are not protected.
The only scenario in which ICU capacity is not exceeded is GSD3, where both
groups are targeted. Compared to GSD2, this scenario does not lead to fewer deaths,
though. This is due to the fact that vulnerable individuals are less restricted and,
thus, those who have a higher probability to suffer a severe course of infection
and to eventually pass away will incur relatively more infections. Moreover, since
interactions among less vulnerable individuals are more restricted, a larger share
of the population is still susceptible after 500 days. Compared to scenario USD1,
where uniform social distancing is applied in a mild form and all interactions imply
an effective reproduction number of about R = 1.5, the death toll in scenario GSD3
is reduced by about 50 000 (approx. 40 %) and ICU capacity is not exceeded, while
it is exceeded on up to 11 days in scenario USD1. Hence, protection of vulnerable
groups in addition to mild social distancing measures for the rest of the population
can be effective to some extent. The results of scenarios GSD1 and GSD2 show, on
the contrary, that protection of the vulnerable population alone is not sufficient to
adequately cope with the epidemic, i.e., reduce the death toll to a bearable level and
protect the health system, even if measures to protect the vulnerable population
are quite extreme.
4.4. Tracing and Quarantine. We now use the SEI3 Q3 RD model to assess the
effect of introducing the use of tracing apps with the aim to send individuals to
quarantine who had contact to an infectious individual. Recall that we assume that
only symptomatic infectious individuals are identified and that infection chains can
only be broken if both, the infectious and the potentially infected individual, use the
app. We investigate different levels of compliance by varying the model parameter ψ
between 0.2 (20 % use the app, low compliance; “l”) and 0.8 (80 % use the app,
high compliance; “h”). We also consider a scenario in which individuals with low
vulnerability use the app more effectively. We do so against the background that (i)
highly vulnerable individuals are often elderly people who might use smartphones
less consistently and that (ii) the benefit of app usage among less vulnerable young
people is significantly higher since it enables society to resume productive activities
and, while doing so, breaking infection chains.
Tracing can be applied as the only measure or it can be combined with other
strategies like uniform or group-specific social distancing. We show results for all
three cases, with varying compliance patterns. The tracing scenarios we present
in detail add contact tracing on top of the benchmark scenario B2 (B2-Trace),
the uniform social distancing scenario USD1 (USD1-Trace) and the group-specific
social distancing scenario GSD3 (GSD3-Trace). In Tables 8–10, we show results for
three different patterns of compliance: both groups have high compliance, i.e., 80 %
take-up rate of the app (hh), both groups have low compliance, i.e., 20 % take-up (ll),
and the case in which the less vulnerable have high compliance of 80 %, while only
20% out of the vulnerable use the app effectively (hl).
In all scenarios, tracing is effective to reduce the death toll in the first 500 days
substantially if compliance is high, but not if compliance is low. In B2-Trace (only
tracing without further measures), for example, with high compliance in both groups,
about 450 000 deaths are avoided in the first 500 days, a reduction of about 80-85 %.
Moreover, tracing is effective in keeping the number of severe cases within ICU

capacity if compliance is high. There are, however, still 88 000–89 000 deaths even in
this case. Recall that this scenario uses a low asymptomatic rate. The asymptomatic
rate is key for tracing and if it is increased to 50 % only for the L group, then there
are around 132 000 deaths in this case. With low compliance, by contrast, tracing is
ineffective and barely improves over the benchmark case. At the peak, the severe
cases massively outnumber ICU capacity and the death toll is high (see left panel in
Figure 2). If only the group with low vulnerability is compliant, the death toll is
substantially reduced compared to the same scenario without tracing. ICU capacity,
however, is still exceeded for a long period of time, but less strongly compared to
the case where both groups have low compliance, see the right panel in Figure 2.
The fact that the epidemic progresses more slowly in this case implies that ICU
capacity is exceeded for more days as compared to the case where both groups show
low compliance. For the same reason it is exceeded by a smaller amount on most of
these days, especially at and around the peak; see top panels of Figure 3.
If we add tracing onto a scenario with uniform or group-specific social distancing
(USD1-Trace and GSD3-Trace; see Tables 9 and 10), we see similar patterns, but in
a context where there is substantially less strain on the health system compared
to the benchmark scenarios. The death toll is significantly reduced compared to
the respective scenarios without tracing if compliance is high—but not if it is low.
Interestingly, if only the group with low vulnerability has a high take-up rate, and

Figure 2. Dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic for scenario B2Trace with low (20%) compliance by both groups (ll, left) and with
mixed (20% by group H and 80% by group L) compliance (hl, right):
Symptomatic individuals (traced and not traced added together) in
blue, asymptomatic in green, severe cases in purple, overall severe
cases (H and L group aggregated) in orange, dead in red, and ICU
capacity in black. The group with low vulnerability has dotted
curves, the group with high vulnerability is plotted solidly.
social distancing is in place, the death toll is close to the death toll under generally
high compliance if group-specific social distancing is in place. The numbers also
show that even if compliance is low, tracing is able to shave off some of the peak
demand for ICU beds. In scenario USD1-Trace, this means that we manage to
stay within ICU capacity with tracing but not without (in the GSD3 scenario, ICU
capacity is sufficient already without tracing). There are, of course, also scenarios
based on group-specific social distancing in which without tracing, ICU capacity is
exceeded but not without.
Figure 3 visualizes the difference in severe infections and death tolls in a situation
where only tracing is applied without further measures (upper two figures, scenario
B2-Trace) and the situation where tracing is combined with group-specific social
distancing (lower two figures, scenario GSD3-Trace). The left panel shows the case
of low compliance (ll), while the right panel shows the case of mixed compliance (hl).
Obviously, high compliance among the individuals with low vulnerability suffices to
keep the death toll extremely low in case the vulnerable group is protected (lower
right panel). In case of no further measures (upper left panel), the number of severe
infections are reduced, however, ICU capacity is still exceeded for a long time period
and the death toll is high. This can be seen in Figure 2 (red curve), which shows
the same scenario with a different scale at the ordinate.
Figure 4 highlights the crucial role of compliance when it comes to the use of
tracing apps. The top-left panel shows the benchmark case B2-Trace. It illustrates
that—if compliance is high—the death toll can be significantly reduced. The figure
also illustrates a very steep gradient. As compliance decreases, the death toll
increases very quickly. For a compliance rate of 70 %, the number of deaths exceeds
200 000 (a 1700 % increase over full compliance) and as compliance drops to 40 %,
the number of deaths shoots up to exceed 500 000. This suggests that tracing should
be used in a careful way and combined with a tailored strategy to open up sectors
where tracing can be made mandatory—if one wants to rely on its effectiveness.
The bottom-left panel shows the same effects in scenario GSD3-Trace. As social
distancing measures are in place in this scenario, the death toll is smaller. Note also
that—since vulnerable groups are protected in this scenario—the gradient is less

Figure 3. Dynamics of the epidemic (higher level of detail) for
Scenario B2-Trace with low compliance (ll, top left) and mixed compliance (hl, top right) and Scenario GSD3-Trace with low compliance
(ll, bottom left) and mixed compliance (hl, bottom right). Severely
affected infectious individuals in purple (traced and not traced
lumped together), overall severely affected infectious individuals in
orange (traced and non traced of both groups, H and L), dead in
red, and ICU capacity in black. The group with low vulnerability

steep: 70 % compliance in this scenario implies a 70 % increase in deaths compared
to full compliance, as opposed to the 1700 % increase observed in B2-Trace.
Another crucial parameter for the success of tracing is the asymptomatic rate.
As asymptomatic individuals do not notice that they are ill, they and their contacts
cannot be removed from the infectious population via contact tracing. The top-right
panel in Figure 4 shows the effect of increasing the asymptomatic rate in Scenario B2
with 80 % compliance, starting from 25 %. Clearly, the higher the asymptomatic
rate the less effective tracing is in reducing new infections and ultimately deaths.
The bottom-right panel shows a similar effect for GSD3. It is noticeable, though,
that the gradient here is much less steep, i.e., contact tracing with a high compliance
rate is still effective if the asymptomatic rate is higher.
Last, Appendix Figures 5 and 6 show the same curves on the same scale as Figure
1 for the scenarios discussed in Figures 2 and 3.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose an extension of the epidemiological SEIR model to
enable the analysis of several measures of epidemic control that are currently
discussed. We introduce different groups into the SEIR model that may differ both
in their underlying parameters as well as in their behavioral response to public

health interventions. In particular, we allow the infectiousness parameters to differ
within and across groups. Moreover, groups may have different asymptomatic,
hospitalization, and lethality rates. Within this framework, we are able to analyze
social distancing measures that differentiate across groups, specific protection of
groups with high lethality rates, as well as the detailed effects of “trace & isolate”
strategies with different levels of take-up of the tracing apps needed. We moreover
shed light on the attractiveness of combining these measures.
Our results highlight sharp trade-offs between different goals of epidemic control
and also illustrate how tailored social distancing and protection measures could
be effectively combined with a “trace & isolate” approach to keep severe infections
within the capacity of the health system and the death toll low. However, our
analysis also clearly illustrates the well known downside of rigorous epidemic control:
The duration of the epidemic is extended far into the future, making it necessary
to continue rigorous control measures for possibly very long time-spans until a
vaccine becomes widely available. On the positive side, we illustrate that mild social
distancing in combination with a “trace & isolate” approach could be a promising
way to control the epidemic in the medium run. This is, however, only true if take-up
rates for the apps are high enough within those groups in which social distancing
restrictions are looser. This is an unlikely scenario in everyday life, however, it could
well create opportunities to open businesses under the condition that tracing is made
mandatory. This could definitely apply to industrial production and the services
industry, and may also be a temporary regime in education. From a practical
perspective, the speed of infection control will also be crucial for effectiveness. In

our model we assume that infection chains are broken whenever the infectious and
the infected individual use an app. This, however, is only true if the health system
operates fast enough to isolate the infected individual within the incubation period.
Let us finally note that all our results stem from a case study that necessarily
builds on a fragile data base. As we learn more from randomized controlled trials and
large-scale observational studies, this situation will change. The main contribution
of our paper, the extension of the SEIR model to SEI3 Q3 RD, can easily be applied
to new and more reliable data sets. Our model and results also provide guidance
to which parameters are key to be identified reliably to analyze the effectiveness of
epidemic control approaches in more detail.
