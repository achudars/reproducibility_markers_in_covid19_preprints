Abstract
Background. There are limited data on COVID-19 patients in Vietnam. The paper examined
and compared epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam
Method. The data was obtained using publicly available information from the official website of
Vietnam Ministry of Health covering a period of 01/23/2020 to 05/27/2020. T-test, Chi-square
test and Fisher’s Exact test were utilized to compare characteristics of COVID-19 patients
between under-treatment and discharge groups and between overseas and non-overseas travel
groups.
Results. Vietnam had a total of 327 cases of COVID-19 as of May 27, 2020. The median age of
patients was 30 years (ranging from 3 months to 88 years). About 68% of patients (n=223) had
acquired the disease from overseas while 32% were infected from local transmission. Among
those infected from local transmission, 66% were women. Men were more likely than women to
be infected with COVID-19 from overseas (p<0.001). Younger patients were significantly
associated with international travel (p=.001). While patients in the South reported highest levels
of overseas travel history (77.9%), those (100%) in the Central reported the highest level of
being discharged (p<0.001). Women (54.7%) had a higher rate of discharge compared to men
(45.3%) [p<0.001]. Nearly 86% have recovered and discharged from hospitals. There has been
no reported fatality.
Conclusions. A majority of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were acquired overseas. A significantly
higher number of women than men were infected inside the country calling for further research
about gender disparities in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam.

Introduction
The outbreak of COVID-19 began in China on December 2019 and has quickly spread all over
the world [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March
11, 2020 [2]. As of May 27, the total number of confirmed cases was 5,549,131 and 348,224
deaths were reported worldwide [3].

Vietnam, a country with 97 million people, had its first Covid-19 case in January 23, 2020 [4].
As of May 27, Vietnam has had a total of 327 COVID-19 confirmed cases with no fatalities [5].
The COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam can be divided into two waves [6]. The first wave
included 23 patients, which mainly related to the imported cases from China. These patients were
successfully treated and discharged from hospitals [5]. The second wave started with cases
imported from Europe mainly from the United Kingdom and spread through local communities
[7].

Since Vietnam shares a long northern border with China and had previously experienced the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 [8], it recognized COVID-19 a
threat from the outset, Vietnam first halt all flights to and from Wuhan, began rapid
identification and testing of suspected cases, treatment for positives and instituted rigorous
quarantine policies [9]. Unlike other countries like Germany only documented those infected and
their direct contacts [10], Vietnam employed a four-tier approach to contact tracing and
isolation. Tier one included confirmed cases who were isolated and treated in health facilities.
Tier two were those who had close contact with confirmed cases and were asked to undertake
testing and government-run quarantine for 14 days. Those in Tier three had close contact with

Tier two cases and were required to self-isolate at their residential locations and under active
monitoring and Tier four included the isolation of entire communities [11].

Beside the control measures, Vietnam government timely and constantly updated people the
outbreak [12]. The Ministry of Health actively coordinated with media to conduct an intensive
communication campaign raising public awareness of the COVID-19, promoting adoption of
preventive behaviors (wearing masks, hand washing) and social distancing (e.g. stay home and
avoid large group gathering) through national TV, loudspeakers, mobile communication
motorbikes, street posters, the press and social media [5,9].

Despite limited resources, Vietnam’s early responses and decisive measures have kept the
incidence of Covid-19 low thus far. There have been no new locally transmitted cases of
COVID-19 in 41 days as of May 27, 2020. All reported 59 COVID-19 patients since April 16,
2020 were acquired from overseas and were detected while they were on a mandatory 14-day
quarantine in the designated locations upon their arrival in Vietnam [5].

The purpose of this research paper is to examine and compare epidemiological
characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Vietnam. Data from this study contribute to the
epidemiology of COVID-19 in Vietnam and worldwide.

The data from this paper was obtained using publicly available information from the official
website of the Vietnam Ministry of Health [5] during the period of 01/23/2020 to 05/27/2020 and
was entered and organized using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The data provide details
of each patient including date of diagnosis, age, sex, place of residence, travel and contact
history and discharge status. Clinical data for each patient was not provided, however, the data
summarized major symptoms of all COVI-19 patients. This study was conducted using public
datasets and did not involve human subject and therefore did not require IRB approval.

Analysis
Data were analyzed to describe the characteristics of the patients using mean and percentages. Ttest, Chi-square test and Fisher’s Exact test were used to compare patients’ gender, age and
regions of residence between two treatment status groups and between overseas and nonoverseas travel groups. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0.

Results
A total of 327 patients (corresponding to the cumulative incidence of 34 per 10 million people)
tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized. The epidemiologic curse during the
covering period is shown in Figure 1. A total of 278 (85.5%) recovered and were discharged
from hospitals. The median age of all patients was 30 years old (range: 3 months-88 years old).
The majority (83%) were 50 years old or younger. Fifty percent (n=164) were female (Table 1).

A majority those who were infected inside the country was women (66.3%). Sixty eight percent
of COVID-19 patients including students, workers and foreign visitors (n=223) had acquired the

disease outside the country while 104 cases (31.6%) were infected within the country. Nearly
85.0% of the patients were Vietnamese while the remainder (15.6%) were foreigners including
citizens of the United Kingdom, USA, Germany, Brazil and others.

Of 63 provinces, 31 reported having COVID-19 cases. Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, had the
highest number of patients (n=114), followed by Ho Chi Minh City (n=59), Thai Binh (n=30),
Bac Lieu (n=21), Vinh Phuc (n=19) and the remaining had 1 to 13 cases (Figure 2). The North
Region had the highest number of cases with 63.6% (n=106), followed by the South with 29.1 %
(n=95) and the Central had lowest with 7.3% (n=24).

The results showed men were more likely to infected with COVID-19 from overseas travel
[χ 2(1, n = 327)=15.27; p<0.001] (Table 2). There were significant differences in age between
overseas travel (M=33.1, SD=14.8) and non-overseas travel (M=39.3, SD=15.2) with younger
patients being associated with international travel; [t(325)=3.4, p =.001]. Also, there were
significant differences between regions based on patients ‘overseas travel history. Compared to
those in the North (64.9%) and Central (58.3%), patients in the South (77.9%) reported the
highest level of overseas travel [χ 2(2, n= 327)=6.83; p=0.044].

In terms of treatment status, women (54.7%) had a higher rate of discharge compared to men
(45.3%) [χ 2(1, n = 327)=15.27; p<0.001] (Table 3). Patients infected with COVID-19 inside the
country were more likely to be discharged from the hospital than those infected from overseas
(p<0.001). There were significant differences between regions of residence based treatment
status (p=0.028) with patients in the Central (100%) reporting the highest level of being

discharged. No significant differences were found in age between those who have been
recovered and discharged and those who are still treated in the hospital (p=0.258).

Only 36.5% of patients had the symptoms when confirmed positive to the virus. Among
symptomatic patients, common symptoms included 22.8% fever, 18.5% cough, 9.9 % sore throat
and only 3.4% shortness of breath.

Discussion
While most of the countries including China, Italy, South Korea and US reported fatalities from
COVID-19 [3], there have been no reported fatalities among the patients in Vietnam. Nearly
86% of the patients have recovered and been discharged from the hospital. Other Asian countries
such as Hong Kong, and Taiwan, which had experiences in handling and dealing with the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 and were in a good position responding to
COVID-19, still suffered from COVID-19 fatalities [13,14], the fact Vietnam has no COVID-19
related deaths is an extraordinary outcomes and deserve further research on its handling and
treatment of COVID-19 patients.

The finding revealed that a majority of the infection cases in Vietnam occurred among the people
below 60 years old. This was in contrast with the infection rates of COVID-19 in other countries
like Iran [15], France [16] and Italy [17] in which the infection rates were more dominant among
the people over 60 years old.

Unlike other countries (e.g. the USA) [18], where asymptomatic people are recommended to stay
home and are not recommended to get tested for COVID-19, in Vietnam home-based isolation of
confirmed cases is not allowed and all COVID-19 asymptomatic cases were hospitalized.
Evidence has shown that COVID-19 can transmit while pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic
[19]. Therefore, the transmission situation in Vietnam could have been worse if these
asymptomatic individuals were not detected early and hospitalized as they could have silently
spread the virus in their community.

The majority of infection cases including foreign tourists, students and workers coming back
from oversea were acquired from abroad. The government’s decision to aggressively screen
those coming to the country and quarantine them for 14 days in the concentrated isolation
locations as soon as they came to Vietnam helped prevent the further transmission.

Over 66% of women were infected with COVID-19 from an index patient inside the country. It
could be that women are more likely to be caregivers for the original COVID-19 infected people
and hence they were more likely to be infected. Other possibilities include a lack of personal
protection equipment and lack of awareness of COVID-19. Further exploratory research is
needed to explore the gender disparities of COVID-19 infection in Vietnam.

This study should be interpreted in light of certain limitations. While there is no case fatality yet,
49 patients remain in the hospital and outcomes yet to be known. A time of this writing, Vietnam
has not reported any locally transmitted COVID-19 cases for 41-days. All new cases registered
since April 16, 2020 are Vietnamese workers and students returning from overseas. However,

the pandemic is still going on worldwide, the data therefore should be read as time-dependent
and temporary. At this time, no serological data is available on antibody responses in the
population.

Conclusions
The findings showed that a majority of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam were acquired overseas. A
significantly higher number of women than men were infected inside the country calling for
further research about gender disparities in the fight against COVID-19 in Vietnam. Although
the pandemic continues to spread around the world, Vietnam has not reported a locally
transmitted infection case in 41 days, which might suggest that Vietnam has kept the COVID-19
outbreak under control. Vietnam serve as a standard for comparative studies of COVID-19
containment and mitigation. However, the country still needs to remain vigilant as the pandemic
is still evolving.
