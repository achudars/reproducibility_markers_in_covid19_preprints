Abstract:
Purpose: Covid-19 has affected all people, especially those with chronic diseases, including
Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Covid-19 may affect both motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of
PD patients. We intend to evaluate different aspects of Covid-19 impact on PD patients.
Methods: 647 PD patients were evaluated in terms of PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical
presentations in addition to past medical history during the pandemic through an online
questioner. They were compared with an age-matched control group consist of 673 individuals
and a sample of the normal population consist of 1215 individuals.
Results: The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was 11.28%. The mortality was 1.23%
among PD patients. The prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who undergone DBS was
18.18%. No significant association was found between the duration of disease and the prevalence
of Covid-19. A statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had
direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals was found. No statistically significant
association has been found between the worsening of motor symptoms and Covid-19. PD
patients and the normal population may differ in the prevalence of some psychological disorders,
including anxiety and sleeping disorders, and Covid-19 may affect the psychological status.
Conclusion: PD patients possibly follow tighter preventive protocols, which lead to lower
prevalence and severity of Covid-19 and its consequences in these patients. Although it seems
Covid-19 does not affect motor and psychological aspects of PD as much as it was expected,
more accurate evaluations are suggested in order to clarify such effects.

Introduction:
In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or
Covid-19, causing a pneumonia-like illness, emerged in China and spread quickly all around the
world and now is an ongoing pandemic [1]. The effect of the neurological disorder as a risk
factor for Covid-19 infection is yet to be fully understood, and its impact on clinical features of
these diseases need to be well characterized [2].
Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders of the central
nervous system, with an increased prevalence by aging [3]. As the PD prevalence is related to the
age and elderly and those with comorbidities are more vulnerable to Covid-19 infection, it can be
suggested that Covid-19 infection risk might be increased in PD patients [4]. Moreover, Covid19 can also affect motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD patients [5, 6].
In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of Covid-19 in 647 PD patients along with other
parameters, including mortality during the pandemic, Covid-19 symptoms, alteration in PD
motor and psychological symptoms.

This cross-sectional, case-control study was approved by the Iran National Committee for Ethics
in Biomedical Researches (IR.SBMU.RETECH.REC.1398.439) to investigate Covid-19
prevalence and death rate its clinical features, and further consequences in Parkinson's disease
patients compared to the general population. The studied population was 647 patients diagnosed
with PD based on UK Brain Bank criteria who were being followed-up at the Referral
Movement Disorder Center in Shohada Tajrish hospital, Tehran. The study carried out in
November 2020, when Iran was in the third pick of the coronavirus pandemic. After obtaining
informed consent from all patients, a questionnaire which was prepared for the patients, consists
of demographic data, medical history, and detailed PD-related and Covid-19-related clinical
information of the patients, was completed over the phone call. The same questionnaire was
designed for the control groups and our sample of normal population which has been broadcasted
over the internet and social media. The questionnaire was answered by 1366 individuals, and
among those, 673, and 1215 individuals selected as the age-matched control group and a sample
of the normal population, respectively. No identifiable data was not included in the questioner
such as name, phone number, national ID numbers, etc., for the control group.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis tests were as follows: Fisher Exact Text (for categorical variable), MannWhitney U test (for continuous variables), and Anderson-Darling test (assessment of
distribution). Statistical analysis was done with Excel Microsoft office, and R language (4.0.2
ed,2020) implemented in R studio (1.3.1093 ed,2020). Significance for all statistical analyses
was fixed at 0.05.
Results:
Mortality and Covid-19 prevalence:
In this study, we evaluated 647 PD patients (Mean age: 60.57±12.46, Male: 410, Female: 237)
for Covid-19 prevalence of their Covid-19- and PD-related presentations. 1215 individuals
(Mean age: 39.84±14.90) were considered as a sample of the normal population, and 673
individuals (Mean age: 56.32±11.62) were selected as an age-matched control group. The
prevalence of Covid-19 among 647 PD patients was 11.28%, and it was significantly lower (pvalue<0.05) than the normal population (15.39%). However, the difference of Covid-19
prevalence between PD patients and the control group (14.85%) was statistically insignificant (pvalue≈0.0605). Mortality of PD patients was 1.23% (stroke: 1, cardiac arrest without definite
diagnosis: 2, car accident: 1, gastrointestinal bleeding: 1, Unknown: 3) (Table1). Ten PD patients
(13.69%) were hospitalized because of the severity of Covid-19, while this rate was about 5.34%
for the normal population and the difference between these hospitalization rates was statistically
significant (P-value<0.05). On the other hand, eighteen individuals (18%) in the control group
were hospitalized because of the severity of Covid-19, and the hospitalization rate of this group
was not significantly different from that of PD patients (p-value>0.5). 44 of 647 PD patients
were undergone DBS surgery, and 8 of them (18.18%) got infected with SARS-CoV-19; there

Past medical history of PD patients:
Tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity were the most frequent primary symptoms of PD patients,
respectively, in our study. 272 PD patients had a family history of neurological disorders which
the four most frequent of them was a family history of PD in 156 patients, a family history of
Alzheimer Disease (AD) in 71 patients, a family history of migraine in 64, and a family history
of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in 34. No significant association was found between having a family
history of PD, MS, and migraine and higher/lower prevalence of Covid-19; However,
interestingly, it has been found that such an association exists between having the family history
of Alzheimer and a higher prevalence of Covid-19 (P-value<0.05). 32 of 647 PD patients got
influenza vaccine during the last season. No significant difference has been found in the Covid19 prevalence, neither between PD patients who got influenza vaccine and PD who did not (P-

value>0.7) nor between PD patients and normal population who got influenza vaccine (Pvalue>0.4). Moreover, there was no significant difference between the prevalence of Covid-19 in
PD patients and the control group who both got influenza vaccine. It worth noting that the
normal population and the control group were vaccinated for influenza more than PD patients (Pvalue<0.05 and P-value<0.01 respectively). Duration of PD was about as following: (<1year:
9.4%, 1-5years: 37.09%, 5-10years: 29.05%, >10years: 24.11%) and we could not find any
statistically significant association between duration of disease and prevalence of Covid-19 (Pvalue>0.05).
Covid-19 history:
Myalgia (45.30%), fever (41.09%), fatigue and weakness (39.72%), cough (35.61%), headache
(23.28%), dyspnea (21.91%), Congestion or runny nose (17.80%), sore throat (13.69%) and
anosmia (12.32%) were most frequent symptoms of Covid-19 in the PD patients, respectively
while they were fever (55.08%), fatigue and weakness (55.08%), myalgia (54.01%), cough
(45.98%), headache (43.85%), anosmia (42.78%), loss of appetite (35.82%) and sore throat
(35.29%) in the normal population respectively. PD patients reported significantly lower
occurrence of viral infections before the Covid-19 pandemic in comparison to the normal
population (P-value<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the occurrence of
viral infections before the Covid-19 pandemic in PD patients and the control group (Pvalue>0.1). We found a statistically significant higher prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients
who had direct contact with SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals (72.06%) and that of the normal
population with a similar condition (P-value<0.05). However, there was not a significant
difference between the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients who had direct contact with
SARS-CoV-19 infected individuals and that of the control group with a similar condition (63%)
(p-value>0.1). During the pandemic, 71.87% of PD patients visited their physicians at hospitals
or offices.
PD motor symptoms:
32.92% of PD patients have reported worsening of motor symptoms, while this rate was 38.65%
in PD patients who had undergone a DBS surgery and 41.09% in PD patients who were infected
with Covid-19. No statistically significant difference has been found in worsening of motor
symptoms between PD patients who had Covid-19 and PD patients who did not (P-value>0.1).
Moreover, no statistically significant difference has been found in worsening of motor symptoms
between PD patients who had undergone a DBS surgery and PD patients who had not (Pvalue>0.4). Also, no significant association between the rate worsening of motor symptoms and
the rate of visiting physicians was observed (P-value>0.9).
Psychological evaluations:
43% and 41.09% of all PD patients and PD patients who had Covid-19, respectively, reported
deterioration in their psychological status such as occurrence or worsening of depression. No

statistically significant difference has been found in the rate of deterioration in psychological
status between PD patients who had and had not Covid-19 (P-value>0.7). Such difference was
also statistically insignificant between Covid-19-infected PD patients and either Covid-19infected normal population or Covid-19-infected control group (P-value>0.4 and P-value=1
respectively). There was a statistically significant difference between the rate of deterioration in
psychological status between all PD patients and the normal population and also all PD patients
and the control group (P-value<0.01 and P-value<0.01 respectively), and this rate were higher in
the PD patients in both comparisons. Moreover, this rate was significantly higher in PD patients
who were not infected with Covid-19 in comparison to this rate in not infected individuals in the
normal population (P-value<0.01).
46.21% of all PD patients and 52.05% of PD patients who had Covid-19 declared that they had
experienced anxiety during the pandemic. The prevalence of anxiety was significantly lower in
PD patients in comparison to the normal population (P-value<0.05). Moreover, a statistically
significant difference was present between the rate of anxiety in all PD patients and in the control
group (P-value<0.05). No significant difference was observed in the prevalence of anxiety
between PD patients who had Covid-19 and PD patients who had not Covid-19 (P-value>0.05).
Moreover, the prevalence of anxiety in PD patients who had Covid-19 and the normal population
who had Covid-19 was not significantly different (P-value>0.5). On the other hand, the
difference between the prevalence of anxiety in PD patients who had Covid-19 and the control
group who had Covid-19 was not statistically significant (P-value>0.5). In addition, no
association was observed between the hospitalization of PD patients subsequent to Covid-19 and
the prevalence of anxiety in these patients (P-value>0.5).
18.54% of all PD patients and 26.02% of PD patients who had Covid-19 reported sleeping
problems during the pandemic. Both the normal population and Covid-19-infected portion of the
normal population demonstrated significantly higher rates of sleeping problems in comparison to
all PD patients and PD patients who had Covid-19, respectively (P-value<0.01). However, there
was no statistically significant difference between the rate of sleeping problems in PD patients
and the control group (P-value>0.08), and also, there was no such difference between PD
patients who had Covid-19 and the control group who had Covid-19 (P-value>0.1). However,
the rate of sleeping problems had no significant association with neither rate of hospitalization
nor prevalence of Covid-19 (P-value>0.1).
Discussion:
The occurrence of Covid-19 and its complications in patients with underlying diseases were
among the very first concerns. The likelihood of hospitalization and death in patients with
movement disorders after Covid-19 is found to be greater in comparison with the general
population.
Different reports have been published concerning the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients;
however, consistency between results cannot be seen in some cases. A study showed that Covid19 prevalence in PD patients was similar to the controls, and the difference in mortality rates

between the PD population and the control were not significant. However, considering the
methodology of this study, it can be said that some patients might be passed away or hospitalized
in other facilities and hence unreachable for monitoring and data-collecting procedures [6];
therefore, the mortality rate might be quite inaccurate. In this study, the PD patients infected with
Covid-19 were younger, more frequently obese, and suffering from chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease in comparison to not infected patients. The younger age of this group may be
due to the lower preventive measures of young people [7].
In contrast, in another study, the expected rate of deaths in hospitalized patients with idiopathic
PD found to be higher than that of PD patients before the pandemic period [8], suggesting that
Covid-19 may play a role. Delay in seeking medical attention is suggested as a possible cause for
such an outcome [8]. It is also reported that PD patients were at a significantly higher risk of
dying from Covid-19 compared to patients without PD [9]. Tuscany study on 740 PD patients
revealed Covid-19 prevalence of 0.9% among these patients in addition to 0.13% mortality. The
prevalence of Covid-19 was higher in respect to that of in general population in Tuscany and
Italy [9]. Hypertension and diabetes were more prominent in PD patients affected with Covid-19
compare to non-Covid-19, indicating these two comorbidities may act as risk factors for Covid19 in PD [10]. Moreover, either motor or non-motor symptoms did not worsen in PD patients
during the lockdown period [11]. During a large cohort (1407 patients) conducted in PiedmontItaly, the prevalence of Covid-19 in interviewed PD patients was found to be 0.57%, while
Covid-19 prevalence was 0.63% for the general population in the same region. It is reported that
75% of PD patients lost their lives because of Covid-19 in comparison to the mortality rate of
11.53% in the general population [11]. The similarity between PD patients and the general
population’s Covid-19 prevalence may be due to higher levels of attention, percussion and selfisolation among these patients [11]. It is suggested that older age and longer disease duration
might be predictors of worse outcomes as the mortality rate is higher among older patients with a
longer duration of disease [12]. In the last study, PD symptoms worsened in all patients, and
fever (100%), weakness (43%), muscle pain (29%), dyspnea (29%), and cough (14%) were the
most frequent PD symptoms, which got worsen early before or early after the onset of Covid-19
signs [12]. Wuhan’s study reported a 1.77% prevalence of Covid-19. Moreover, 3 out of 509
(0.58%) PD patients diagnosed with Covid-19 died. Old age, chronic comorbidities, neurological
complications, and sudden discontinuation of anti-parkinsonian drugs were recognized as
potential risk factors for mortality in Covid-19 patients with PD [12]. Another study reported a
2.6% prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients with zero mortality. It is reported that more than
half of the patients experienced worsening of the symptoms, which were as the following:
bradykinesia 47.7%, sleep problems 41.4%, rigidity 40.7%, gait disturbances 34.5%, anxiety
31.3%, pain 28.5%, fatigue 28.3%, depression 27.6%, tremor 20.8%, and appetite disorders
13.2% [12]. Cardiovascular diseases are suggested as possible risk factors in worse outcomes in
PD patients affected with Covid-19 [13]. A different mortality rate is reported in another study in
which a multi-center cohort revealed 19.7% overall mortality among PD patients diagnosed with

Covid-19. Dementia, hypertension, and PD duration may be potential predictors for such
outcomes [14].
Most studies have an agreement on the possibly higher Covid-19 prevalence and Covid-19related mortality in PD patients, while some others have predicted such outcome considering the
pathophysiological processes of both Covid-19 infection and PD. It has been suggested that
susceptibility of PD to Covid-19 may be related to either the pathophysiology of PD, factors that
are subsequent to the current condition of the health system during the pandemic, or direct and
indirect health effects of Covid-19 on PD patients. In our study, the prevalence of Covid-19
among PD patients was 11.28% which was significantly lower than that of the normal
population. A lower prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients was not expected as it has been
hypothesized in many articles that PD patients are at higher risk for being infected with SARSCoV-19 due to some reasons as below. Pathophysiological processes of PD lead to respiratory
complications [14], gastrointestinal problems [15], sedentary lifestyle [4, 16], immune systems
malfunction [16], nervous systems dysfunction [4, 16], and a need for using medications with
possible side effects and drug interactions [17], may place PD patients at higher risks of
mortality and morbidity subsequent to Covid-19 infection. However, the effect of anti-PD drugs
was found to be insignificant on the prevalence of Covid-19 [17]. In contrast, in another study,
sudden discontinuation of anti-parkinsonian drugs is recognized as a potential cause of death in
PD patients infected with Covid-19 [16, 18]. Advanced age of PD patients and long disease
duration would be other risk factors for vulnerability to Covid-19 [8]. However, the lower
prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients in comparison to the normal population in our study may
be due to more aggressive preventive protocols that these patients follow. Moreover, in line with
the last statement, the observation that the prevalence of Covid-19 in PD patients and the control
group was not significantly different, can be interpreted as a result of possible aggressive
preventive protocols that the individuals in the control group would follow because of their
underlying diseases or advanced ages. This suggestion can be strengthened by the result that also
the prevalence of other viral infections in PD patients before the pandemic was lower than the
normal population. Moreover, these results may not be interpreted as the consequences of the
pathophysiology of PD or its medications, as we have observed that PD patients who had first
degree relatives infected with Covid-19 possessed a higher prevalence of Covid-19 in
comparison with the same group in the normal population. This result indicates that possibly PD
patients are at higher risk of being infected with Covid-19. We also analyzed the prevalence of
Covid-19 in a group of PD patients who had undergone a DBS surgery, and it seems that DBS
surgery might not put PD patients at higher risk of Covid-19.
We found that although PD patients were hospitalized because of the severity of Covid-19 more
than our normal population, the rate of hospitalization among these patients was not significantly
different from our control group. This may indicate that other causes are involved in increasing
the rate of hospitalization rather than PD. Our observation is in line with a paper from Vignatelli
et al., which states that “PD per se probably is not a risk factor for Covid-19 hospitalization”
[19].

The current condition also imposes limitations which may lead to deterioration in PD clinical
course. Reduction in physical activity during quarantine may lead to worsening of both motor
and non-motor symptoms as exercise may attenuate clinical symptom progression in PD [13].
Availability of PD medications, health services, and physicians’ advice or guidance during the
lockdowns is recognized as an important factor in the deterioration of the clinical course of PD
patients. In this sense, disability in PD patients may increase due to a lack of access to suitable
and sufficient medications. This condition may lead to an increase in motor, non-motor, and
neuropsychiatric symptoms and possibly higher mortality [17, 18].
In our study, 32.92%, 38.65%, and 41.09% of PD patients, PD patients who had undergone a
DBS surgery, and PD patients who were infected with Covid-19 reported worsening of motor
symptoms. However, we could not find any significant between Covid-19 infection and
worsening of motor symptoms or between DBS surgery and worsening of motor symptoms.
Moreover, we could not find any association between a deterioration in psychological status and
Covid-19 in PD patients. Such association could not also be found between anxiety and Covid19 and sleeping disorders and Covid-19. But interestingly, the normal population demonstrated
higher levels of deterioration in psychological status, anxiety, and sleeping disorders than PD
patients. Since our normal population was significantly younger than the population of PD
patients, it is possible to interpret these results as a reflection of higher levels of psychological
tensions that younger people encounter with. This interpretation can be strengthened with the
observation that PD patients had significantly higher levels of deterioration in psychological
status and anxiety than the control group with a similar mean age. Therefore, it can be said the
PD patients may have higher levels of deterioration in psychological status and anxiety than the
control group due to some unknown underlying mechanisms in the pathophysiology of PD, but
these two are not as high as they are in the normal population because of possibly more
psychological tensions.
Since some PD patients could not be reached because they may have passed away or hospitalized
in other facilities, the prevalence of Covid-19 and the rate of mortality might be slightly different
in comparison with the condition that these points are taken into account. Another limitation of
our study would be the inaccuracy of our control group in terms of gender and age distribution in
spite of similar mean age.
Conclusion:
Patients with chronic diseases including, PD, are thought to be at higher risks of infection and its
complications during the Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, Covid-19 may affect different aspects
of PD, including motor and psychological signs and symptoms, but in a different way
unexpectedly.
