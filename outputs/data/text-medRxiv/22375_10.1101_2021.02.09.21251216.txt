Short title: COVID-19 outbreak in Blaine County, Idaho

Abstract
Blaine County, Idaho, a rural area with a renowned resort, experienced an outbreak of novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We undertook an epidemiologic investigation to describe the
outbreak and guide public health action. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were identified from
reports of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory test results to South Central Public Health District.

Information on symptoms, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close
contacts was obtained by medical record review and patient interviews. Viral sequence analysis
was conducted on a subset of available specimens. During March 13–April 10, 2020, a total of
451 COVID-19 cases occurred among Blaine County residents (1,959 cases per 100,000
population). An additional 37 cases occurred in out-of-state residents. Among the 451 COVID19 patients, the median age was 51 years (Interquartile range [IQR]: 37–63), 52 (11.5%) were
hospitalized, and 5 (1.1%) died. The median duration between specimen collection and a positive
laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4–10). Forty-four (9.8%) patients reported recent travel.
Healthcare workers comprised 56 (12.4%) cases; 33 of whom worked at the only hospital in the
county, leading to a 15-day disruption of hospital services. Of 562 close contacts monitored by
public health authorities, 22 (3.9%) had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and an additional 29
(5.2%) experienced compatible symptoms. Sequencing results from 34 Idaho specimens
supported epidemiologic findings indicating travel as a source of SARS-CoV-2, and identified
multiple lineages among hospital workers. Community mitigation strategies included school and
resort closure, stay-at-home orders, and restrictions on incoming travelers. COVID-19 outbreaks
in rural communities can disrupt health services. Lack of local laboratory capacity led to long
turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. Rural communities frequented by tourists should
consider implementing restrictions on incoming travelers among other mitigation strategies to
reduce COVID-19 transmission.
Introduction
Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019
and soon spread internationally, with the first case in the United States reported in Washington
state on January 20, 2020.1 Rural areas might be particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19

pandemic, because people living in rural areas in the US tend to be older, have higher rates of
underlying conditions, and less access to health services.2,3 Approximately 15% of Americans
live in rural areas. The health gap between rural and urban US was highlighted by a 2017 report
identifying higher age-adjusted death rates for the five leading causes of death in
nonmetropolitan areas.4 Rural health departments face unique challenges related to serving the
needs of populations that experience poorer health outcomes in large geographical areas with
limited resources.3
Idaho, located in northwest region of the US, has an estimated population of approximately 1.79
million, of which 32.4% reside in rural areas.5 Idaho is divided into 44 counties, 32 (73%) of
which are classified as rural6, and seven autonomous public health districts comprising 4 to 8
counties each. On March 13, 2020, a case of confirmed COVID-19 in a Blaine County resident
was reported to South Central Public Health District (SCPHD); this was the second case
identified in Idaho. Blaine County is a scenic, mountainous rural area with an estimated 23,021
residents, of whom 23.5% are Hispanic or Latino.7 It is a popular weekend and vacation
destination, with abundant outdoors and cultural activities, including the Sun Valley Resort, an
internationally renowned ski area. An estimated 32% of housing units are occupied seasonally as
second homes or short-term rentals.8 The county is economically diverse, with a 2018 median
household income of $51,968 and a poverty rate of 14%.9 In this report, we present the
epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak in Blaine County including patient characteristics,
hospitalization rates, travel history, and healthcare worker status. Sequence analysis of available
SARS-CoV-2 specimens supported epidemiological findings. We examine positive COVID-19
test turnaround times and describe the interruption of hospital services, and the public health
response.

Methods
Case identification and investigation
A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a clinical
specimen (nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or oropharyngeal swab) by using real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular amplification detection test.
Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified via reporting of SARS-CoV-2-positive laboratory
tests to SCPHD. Case information, including electronic laboratory reports, was collected and
stored using Idaho’s National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) Base System
(NBS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-supported integrated disease
surveillance system. Initial investigation determined the usual residence of the patient to confirm
reporting jurisdiction, as cases in out-of-state residents are not included in official case counts
per standard reporting procedures.10
Data on symptom onset, hospitalization, recent travel, healthcare worker status, and close
contacts were obtained by medical record review and interviews with patients or their proxies.
Healthcare workers were defined as paid employees or volunteers who worked at a hospital or
other healthcare facility, pharmacists, emergency medical service responders, and firefighters
with emergency medical technician certification.
Initially, close contacts were defined as household members and others who spent ten minutes or
more within a six feet of a patient from 1 day prior to symptom onset in the patient with COVID19; this time frame was expanded to 2 days prior to symptom onset following further evidence of
presymptomatic transmission.11 Close contacts were monitored through 14 days after exposure.

Following diagnostic testing at the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories, aliquots of viral transport
media were preserved at -80C until a subset was selected for sequencing. Selected samples
were preserved in Zymo DNA/RNA Shield, a proprietary reagent which stabilizes nucleic acid
samples at ambient temperatures, and sent to the University of New Mexico Center for Global
Health for whole genome sequence analysis. Sequencing was conducted using the ARCTIC
protocol, version 3 and assembly was performed by the Center for Global Health.12 All finished
sequences were uploaded with required metadata to the GISAID EpiCoV™ (S1 Table).
All complete, high coverage, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from samples collected during March 1–
March 12, 2020 in the USA were downloaded from the GISAID database (S2 Table).13 This
period represents the 10 days prior to the first laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case in Idaho.
Idaho sequences from Blaine County were BLASTed against this subset of sequences using the
MEGABLAST tool within Bionumerics. The top two hits by sequence identity were selected for
further analysis. The BLAST hits, Blaine County sequences, and sequences from other Idaho
counties (collected March 1–April 1, 2020) were compared using Bionumerics Multiple
Sequence Alignment Tool and clustered using a Minimum Spanning Tree.
Census block group analysis
Patient addresses were geocoded using Texas A&M Geocoding Services
(http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/) to obtain census block group identifiers. Block
groups are statistical divisions of census tracts that typically cover contiguous areas and contain
between 600 and 3,000 people.14 For each block group, median household income, the
proportion of Hispanic or Latino residents, and renter-occupied housing units was obtained using

2014–2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates downloaded from
https://data.census.gov/cedsci/.
Community mitigation measures
Information on school and business closures and governmental orders was obtained from press
releases. Data on the estimated proportion of county residents staying at home were made
publicly available by SafeGraph, Inc.15
Data analysis
Data were analyzed using Stata version 14.2 and graphs created in Excel. Data were reported as
percentages for categorical variables and median, interquartile range (IQR), and range for
continuous variables.
Research determination
COVID-19 is a reportable disease under Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Rules, IDAPA
16.02.10. Case investigation, data collection, and analysis were conducted for public health
purposes, and the CDC determined the investigation to be nonresearch as defined in 45 CFR
46.102. As such, ethical approval and informed consent was not required.
Results
Four weeks after the first case was identified, a total of 452 confirmed cases were reported
among Blaine County residents. One case was excluded because the patient was temporarily
residing in another state during the outbreak. An additional 37 cases were identified among outof-state residents who were tested in Blaine County; these included 26 residents of areas where

COVID-19 outbreaks were known to have been occurring (15 patients from King County,
Washington and 11 patients from counties in California where community spread had occurred).
Blaine County experienced one of the highest rates of COVID-19 cases per capita
(1,959/100,000) in the US at the time of this investigation. Of the 451 patients, 239 (53.0%) were
female. The median age at onset was 51 years (IQR: 38–63 years), with 5 (1.1%) patients aged
<18 years, 169 (37.4%) aged 18–44 years, 172 (38.1%) aged 45–64 years, and 106 (23.5%) aged
>65 years. Race and ethnicity data indicated that 332 (73.5%) patients were white, 9 (2.0%)
other race, and 73 (16.2%) Hispanic or Latino, with data missing for 37 (8.2%) patients.
Among 447 patients with symptom data available, 446 (99.8%) reported at least one symptom.
Most commonly reported symptoms included cough (n = 299, 66.9%), fever (measured or
subjective; n = 275, 61.5%), myalgia or body aches (n = 208, 46.5%), fatigue (n = 205, 45.9%),
headache (n = 164, 36.7%), and shortness of breath (n = 137, 30.6%). Other reported symptoms
included chills (n = 111, 24.8%), loss of taste or smell (n = 101, 22.6%), sore throat (n = 83,
18.6%), diarrhea (n = 83, 18.6%), congestion (n = 81, 18.1%), pain or tightness in chest (n = 55,
12.4%), nausea or vomiting (n = 54, 12.1%), loss of appetite (n = 39, 8.7%), and runny nose (n =
36, 8.1%).
A total of 52 (11.5%) patients were hospitalized. The number and proportion of patients who
were hospitalized increased with age, ranging from no (0%) patients aged <18 years, 5 (3.0%)
patients aged 18–24 years, 14 (8.1%) aged 45–64 years, and 33 (31.4%) persons aged >65 years.
The median length of admission was 5 days (IQR: 2–11 days, range = 1–38 days). Of 50
hospitalized patients with available data, 21 (42%) were admitted to the intensive care unit.
Overall, five (1.1%) patients died; all were aged >60 years and 4 (80%) were male.

The median duration between symptom onset and specimen collection was 5 days (IQR: 2–8;
range = 0–24). The median duration from specimen collection to reporting of a positive SARSCoV-2 laboratory result was 9 days (IQR: 4–10 days; range = 1–22 days): 2 days (IQR: 1–3;
range = 1–5) for high-priority specimens (e.g., from healthcare workers and hospitalized
patients) tested by the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories (n = 41), and 9 days (IQR: 5–10; range = 1–
22) for specimens tested at commercial laboratories (n = 410). Idaho Bureau of Laboratories
began SARS-CoV-2 testing on March 2, and regional commercial laboratories began SARSCoV-2 testing on March 5. Testing availability increased in Blaine County following the March
17 opening of a COVID-19 screening and testing center adjacent to the sole hospital in the
county (Hospital A) and operated by their health system.
At least 11 cases were linked to three events (a ski festival and two private events) held during
the first week of March that attracted many out-of-state and international travelers. Data on
recent travel history and healthcare worker status were available for 450/451 (99.8%) cases. Of
these, 44 (9.8%) patients reported travel from another state or country during the 2 weeks prior to
symptom onset. In total, 56 (12.4%) cases were among healthcare workers, 33 of whom worked
at Hospital A, a critical access hospital (a designation given to eligible rural hospitals by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Affected hospital staff held clinical and nonclinical roles throughout the hospital.
Figure 1 illustrates the epidemiologic curve for COVID-19 illness onset among 447 patients with
available data, including healthcare workers. Hospital A suspended normal operations on March
20, one day after community spread in Blaine County was announced. Hospital A’s emergency
department and COVID-19 screening and testing center remained open; however, non-emergent
appointments and procedures were postponed, inpatient services discontinued, and affiliated

community clinics closed. Patients requiring admission were transported by emergency medical
services to the nearest regional hospital located 78 miles away. Hospital A resumed limited
services on April 3. S3 Figure depicts hospitalizations over time by date of admission.

on the graph.
Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences was conducted on a convenience sample of available
specimens from Idaho patients diagnosed with COVID-19, including 23 from Blaine County
residents and 11 from other counties in Idaho. Several genomes from Blaine County residents
were closely related to sequences identified in other states including New York, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Rhode Island (Figure 2). Three genomes from patients who were residents of
other Idaho counties but spent time in Blaine County prior to illness onset were closely related to
genomes from Blaine County residents (Figure 2). Analysis of viral sequences from Hospital A
staff members identified three SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting that the outbreak among
Hospital A staff was not due to a single source (S4 Figure).

are listed in S1 Table.
Census block group estimates were used to examine geographic distribution and community
characteristics for 402 (89.1%) COVID-19 patients whose addresses were matched to a census
block group. At least one case occurred in each of the 13 census block groups in Blaine County
(S5 Table). Community characteristics varied substantially by census block group. Over half (n =
216, 53.7%) of cases occurred among residents of four census block groups. Within these four
census block groups, the proportion of the population that are Hispanic or Latino ethnicity
ranged from 4.6% to 47.1% and the proportion of persons in renter-occupied housing ranged
from 11.1% to 49.2%.
Public health authorities, the county government, and local stakeholders undertook several
measures to contain the outbreak and limit community transmission. SCPHD conducted contact
tracing and monitored 562 close contacts of Blaine County cases; 22 (3.9%) of these close
contacts tested positive for COVID-19 and an additional 29 (5.2%) became symptomatic but
were not tested. During March 9–April 10, SCDPH staff worked 4,074 hours on COVID-19
emergency response. This response supported all eight counties in the jurisdiction, however
452/495 (91.3%) cases occurred in Blaine County. Volunteers spent 158 hours conducting
contact monitoring activities. Blaine County School District closed school buildings on March
14. Sun Valley Resort closed for the season on March 16. The Idaho Department of Health and
Welfare (IDHW) issued an order of isolation for Blaine County residents on March 20. Central
District Health, whose jurisdiction borders SCPHD and includes the state capital of Boise (less
than three hours driving time from Sun Valley Resort) issued a statement on March 22
instructing anyone with recent travel to Blaine County to shelter in place following identification

of four COVID-19 cases among residents who had recently been in Blaine County. On March
25, IDHW issued a statewide order to self-isolate. On March 27, Blaine County issued an order
with additional restrictions including the prohibition of non-essential travel into or out of Blaine
County and 14-day self-quarantine for residents or visitors coming from out of state. Figure 3
shows the timing of these measures along with cumulative case counts. Publicly accessible data
from SafeGraph, Inc. reported county-level percentage of people staying home all day (based on
GPS data from anonymous mobile devices) indicating that the proportion of people staying at
home increased steadily from March 15 through early April (Figure 4).

Discussion
The start of the outbreak in Blaine County was likely linked to travel to the ski resort, high rates
of seasonal residence, and three events held during the first week of March which attracted
numerous out-of-state attendees. COVID-19 outbreaks have been identified in mountain resort
communities elsewhere in the US and in Europe.16,17 The epidemic curve indicated a peak in
illness onset in mid-March, consistent with exposures occurring during the two weeks prior. The

median incubation period of COVID-19 is estimated to be 5 days, and of exposed people who
experience illness, the vast majority display symptoms within 14 days.18
Several additional COVID-19 cases identified in Blaine County occurred in residents of King
County, Washington and counties in California where community spread had occurred prior to
detection of the first COVID-19 case in Idaho. Cases in out-of-state residents, although not
included in official case counts, are indicative of frequent travel from the west coast and likely
contributed to the level of transmission observed. Blaine County was the first county in Idaho to
announce community spread of COVID-19 despite being the 17th most populous county.
Interstate spread has been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 importations in other regions of the United
States. Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 found that 7 of 9 viral genomes from early COVID19 cases in Connecticut clustered with a clade dominated by viruses from cases in Washington
state.19 Sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from Blaine County supported the epidemiological
findings, as several genomes clustered with viruses from other states, suggestive of links to
travel. Because certain states were likely overrepresented in the database of available sequences
from early in the pandemic, and Idaho sequences indicate multiple introductions of SARS-CoV2, the geographic source of the outbreak could not be identified. Limitations on the use of viral
sequencing for this epidemiologic investigation include that only a subset of specimens tested
and stored at the state public health laboratory were available for sequence analysis, as
commercial laboratories typically do not store specimens.
Nearly 13% of cases in Blaine County occurred among healthcare workers. This proportion is
consistent with data from 12 US states reporting healthcare profession status on >80% of
COVID-19 case reports, in which healthcare personnel accounted for 11% of cases.20 Healthcare
workers from Hospital A held both clinical and non-clinical roles, and it was not possible to

determine whether they were infected in the community or in the workplace. Sequencing
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from Hospital A staff indicated multiple exposures rather than a pointsource outbreak caused by a single viral strain. Rural counties have fewer healthcare workers and
facilities compared with urban areas, and the high number of affected workers from Hospital A
led to temporary cessation of inpatient services at the only hospital in the county. Work
exclusion of Hospital A staff who were identified as close contacts of COVID-19 cases also
contributed to the staffing shortage. As Hospital A is part of a larger and well-resourced health
system, it was able to remain partially open and received support from partner hospitals. Hospital
planning for community spread of COVID-19 and developing strategies for mitigating staffing
shortages are critical for maintaining healthcare access in rural areas. In Thailand, a rural hospital
closed following confirmed cases of COVID-19 in three medical personnel and quarantine of the
remaining 21 medical personnel of the hospital.21 A 2007 study on hospital preparedness for
pandemic influenza in Ontario, Canada determined that small and rural hospitals were especially
disadvantaged and identified challenges of smaller and rural hospitals as the top priority area for
a proposed pandemic preparedness learning portal.22 A survey of COVID-19 preparedness
among hospitals in Idaho identified inconsistent implementation of CDC guidelines for infection
prevention, and only 8 of 21 (38%) critical access hospitals had a written respiratory protection
program.23 Limited isolation facilities pose a challenge, as only 2 (10%) critical access hospitals
had an airborne infection isolation room.
The CDC has developed relevant resources including hospital preparedness checklist for
COVID-19 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/hcp-hospital-checklist.html).
Telehealth is another strategy that can be leveraged to help rural hospitals during the COVID-19
pandemic by expanding healthcare capacity, reducing potential exposures of healthcare workers,

and linking with tertiary hospitals to provide additional staffing support and reduce unnecessary
patient transfers.24
Case identification and contact tracing efforts were hindered by long lag times between symptom
onset and receipt of laboratory results. Many contacts were not notified of their potential
exposure until the second week of the 14-day isolation period. Delays in testing turnaround times
might be more prominent in predominantly rural states like Idaho, where commercial testing
during the investigation time frame was only available at regional laboratories located in other
states. Public health laboratory support enabled faster turnaround times for high-priority
specimens. Expansion of diagnostic testing availability, including at hospital diagnostic
laboratories, point-of-care testing, and commercial laboratories has led to shorter turnaround
times in Idaho. A recent commentary advocated for expanded testing in rural areas, as the
authors’ analysis found that states with higher prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors
(hypertension, diabetes, and lung cancer), which tend to be more common in rural populations,
had lower overall testing rates, and medically vulnerable people in rural areas have greater
potential for severe outcomes.25 Contact tracing, which has been highlighted by the National
Association of County & City Health Officials as a key component of safely easing social
distancing measures, depends on the ability to detect COVID-19 cases in a timely manner.26
Social distancing and stay-at-home orders remain valuable tools for reducing transmission within
communities affected by COVID-19, especially in areas with limited or delayed testing. The
increase in cumulative cases began to slow approximately two weeks following implementation
of the county order of isolation. In our experience, after the implementation of community
mitigation measures, most contacts identified were household members.

Evidence from four US metropolitan areas including Seattle (King County) indicated that
community mobility declined following implementation of stay-at-home orders.27 Placing
restrictions on incoming travelers may help slow the spread of COVID-19 into rural areas. In
Blaine County, mitigation strategies including closure of the ski resort and a county-wide
isolation order began within a week of the first reported case. The estimated percentage of people
staying at home, obtained via anonymous cellular phone data, increased following orders of
isolation, consistent with community mobility studies in other areas.
Part-time residents are typically not included in population estimates, limiting the accuracy of
disease incidence estimates in areas where tourism and seasonal residence are common, such as
Blaine County, where the ski season attracts tourists and seasonal workers. Cases of COVID-19
among visitors to Blaine County who were tested outside of Idaho were not captured in our
analysis. Additionally, this report only includes information on laboratory-confirmed cases, as
reporting and investigation of probable cases, guided by the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists, began after the data collection period ended.28 The rapid rise in reported cases
seen in late March and early April might reflect expanded testing availability as well as disease
transmission. However, testing during this time was primarily conducted on symptomatic
persons, and testing of children was relatively uncommon. Data on underlying conditions were
not available, and relationships between patients (other than cases in contacts under monitoring)
were not systematically captured, although several household clusters were identified.
Geocoding patient addresses and census block group data indicated that the outbreak was not
limited to a specific geographical region of the county, and it affected communities of varying
socio-economic characteristics. Of patients with available race and ethnicity information, 17.6%
were Hispanic or Latino, compared with 23.5% of the overall Blaine County population. This

slight underrepresentation might be because of several factors including disparities in access to
health care and testing.29
Using mobile phone data to estimate mobility has known limitations including incomplete
representation.30 It is challenging to directly assess the impact of community mitigation measures
on disease transmission, because of the time lag between exposure, symptom onset, and case
detection, and the multitude of unmeasured factors that might influence COVID-19 transmission
and case detection. The Blaine County outbreak attracted intense local and national media
coverage that could have encouraged residents’ adherence to stay-at-home orders.30,31
Conclusions
Rural communities frequented by travelers can be heavily impacted by COVID-19, leading to
disruption in available health services. Rural hospitals should develop COVID-19 preparedness
plans that include strategies for mitigating staffing shortages. Improving COVID-19 testing
availability and turnaround times will help rural health departments and other stakeholders detect
and respond to COVID-19 outbreaks. In addition to stay-at-home orders and other policies
targeting local residents, closing tourist attractions and implementing restrictions on incoming
travelers can be considered as strategies for limiting community spread in rural areas prior to
widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
