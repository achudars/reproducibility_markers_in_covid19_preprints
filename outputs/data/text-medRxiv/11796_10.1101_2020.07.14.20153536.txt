We have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in a cohort of 96 individuals
with acute infection and in 578 individuals enrolled in a seroprevalence population study in
Switzerland including three groups, i.e. subjects with previous RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infections (n=90), ‘positive patient contacts’ (n=177) and ‘random selected subjects’ (n=311).
SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses specific to the Spike (S), in the monomeric and native trimeric
forms, and/or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were equally sensitive in the acute infection
phase. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein
appear to wane in the post-infection and substantially underestimated the proportion of
SARS-CoV-2 infections in the groups of ‘patient positive contacts’, i.e. 10.9 to 32.2% reduction
and in the ‘random selected’ general population, i.e. up to 45% reduction. The overall
reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N IgG antibodies for the total cohort ranged
from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was more sensitive
as compared to monomeric S proteins.

66

These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the
native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in
population-based seroprevalence studies.

Introduction

84
85

The SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a devastating pandemic with more than 12.7 million

86

documented infections and more than 566’000 deaths, according to the latest WHO situation

87

report from July 13th, 2020.1 However, the true incidence of the infection is largely

88

underestimated, since in most countries asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic people are

89

tested only if they came in direct contact with sick patients or belong to at-risk subgroups.

90

Therefore, it is a public health urgency to perform large-scale population-based studies in

91

order to determine rates of seroprevalence during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

92

and to implement continued surveillance with the combined use of viral detection tests such

93

as RT-PCR and serological testing. Seroprevalence studies are also instrumental to determine

94

the proportion of individuals with potential protective immunity.2-4

95
96

SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses are characterized through the detection of IgG, IgA, and/or

97

IgM. Detecting both IgA and IgG may increase sensitivity, particularly for people experiencing

98

paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic infection. However, IgM does not seem to be of great

99

benefit to overall sensitivity, since IgM appearance coincides with IgG antibodies during the

100

early phase of infection, i.e. less than 15 days after the onset of symptoms and may increase

101

the likelihood of false positive results due to cross-reactivity.5,6

102
103

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses target two proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N) and

104

the Spike protein (S). It has been suggested that IgG antibodies targeting the S protein are

105

more specific while those targeting at N may be more sensitive, particularly in the early phase

106

of infection.7

107
108

However, the increased sensitivity of anti-N antibody response might be at the expense of

109

specificity, given the relatively high protein sequence similarity of the N protein of SARS-CoV-

110

2 with nucleocapsid proteins of other Coronaviridae and other viruses. Moreover, during the

111

SARS outbreak (2002-2004), Chia et al observed that anti-N antibodies waned earlier than anti-

112

S antibodies.8 Thus, anti-S antibody response might be more specific and circumvent a

113

possible decrease of antibodies, previously observed with N protein of the SARS virus.

114

Furthermore, it is still unknown the durability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. Previous

115

studies have shown early disappearance of antibodies to SARS-associated coronavirus after

116

recovery9 while other studies have shown longer durability of the antibody response.10-13

117
118

In the present study we have investigated SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, both IgA and IgG

119

in a cohort of 96 patients with moderate to severe symptoms during the first 33 days of the

120

acute phase of infection and in a cohort of 578 subjects mostly paucisymptomatic and/or

121

asymptomatic enrolled in a population-based seroprevalence study of the Vaud Canton in

122

Switzerland. Antibody responses targeting either the N and/or the S proteins were

123

investigated. Anti-S antibody responses were determined against monomeric moieties of the

124

S1 protein and/or the native S trimeric form. Antibody responses against the S and N proteins

125

were equally sensitive during the acute phase of infection while anti-N antibody responses

126

waned in the post-infection phase. Importantly, the use of the trimeric as compared to the

127

monomeric form of the S protein is associated with greater sensitivity in the detection of SARS-

128

CoV-2 IgG antibody response in both the acute and post-infection phases.

129
130

Taken together, these results indicate that antibody responses against the native trimeric S

131

protein should be used as a reference in population-based seroprevalence studies to provide

132

more accurate estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population.

Results

141

Antibody responses against the native trimeric versus the monomeric S protein

142

A stabilized trimer of the full-length S protein, encompassing both its S1 and S2 moieties, was

143

coupled to beads for capturing antibodies in a new Luminex assay. We hypothesized that

144

conformational epitopes would be preserved in the trimeric S protein, providing a greater

145

sensitivity to detect IgG antibodies (Supplementary Figure 1A and B).14 First, the specificity

146

for IgG antibody binding was established with sera from 256 pre-COVID-19 pandemic healthy

147

adults from 18 to 81 years of age and an additional set of 108 patients (Figure 1A), which

148

included: pregnant women, individuals infected with alphacoronaviruses (NL63 and 229E),

149

betacoronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1), HIV, Rubella, HSV1, HSV2, RSV, CMV, EBV, influenza or

150

varicella, as well as patients suffering from autoimmune diseases such as Lupus. The signal

151

distribution for all SARS-CoV-2 negative sera was similar for the 256 pre-COVID-19 healthy

152

adults and for the diverse panel of 108 subjects. A cut-off for positivity was set at 4-fold above

153

a negative control standard, which is slightly more than four standard deviation above the

154

mean of all negative control samples (mean MFI ratio 0.84 + 4×0.75 SD). Using this threshold,

155

only one sera of the 256 pre-COVID-19 people and two patients with acute HIV or CMV viral

156

infections gave a positive signal (Figure 1 A). As such, the Luminex assay using the stable

157

trimeric S protein gave a high overall specificity of 99.2% and no cross-reactive antibodies

158

were detected in sera from people infected with pre-pandemic coronaviruses or from patients

159

with autoimmune diseases that can produce polyreactive antibodies.

160
161

The sensitivity of the assay was next evaluated using sera from 96 acutely infected SARS-CoV-

162

2 PCR-positive patients with blood sampling at 0-5 days, 6-10 days, 11-15 days and 16-33 days

163

post-onset of symptoms (POS). As anticipated, sera collected during the early stage of the

164

infection (0-5 days POS) had low or undetectable levels of anti-S protein IgG antibodies, with

165

a rate of positivity of 12.5% (1 in 8 subjects; Figure 1B). Seropositivity increased to 42.1%

166

(8/19) at 6-10 days POS and to 91.7% (33/36) at 11-15 days POS. Almost all patients with

167

symptoms for 16-33 days (28/29; 96.6%) displayed high antibody titers for the S protein

168

trimer. Interestingly, the only subject that was negative in the S protein trimer assay at day 25

169

post-onset of symptoms became seropositive when re-tested seven days later.

170

We then performed head-to-head comparisons of S trimeric versus S1 or RBD monomeric

171

proteins for IgG antibody responses within the Luminex assay. The responses observed with

172

the S monomeric proteins were similar in sensitivity to those described in previous studies 15,16

173

using monomeric proteins but inferior to those obtained with the trimeric S protein

174

(Supplemental Figure 2A and B).

175
176

Anti- IgA antibody response against the S protein trimer

177

We next evaluated the S protein trimer for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies.

178

We established assay specificity and a cut-off threshold for positivity by screening sera from

179

pre-COVID-19 healthy adults. Using four standard deviations above the standard negative

180

control, this assay provided a 98.5% specificity in the 256 sera tested. The sensitivity was

181

estimated on 81 out of 96 acute infected SARS-CoV-2 patients’ sera with positive detections

182

ranging from 33.3% of patients at 0-5 days POS with seropositivity increasing to 68.8% in

183

patients from the 6-10 days group. At 11-15 and 16-33 days POS, IgAs were detected in 94.4%

184

and 90% of the cases, respectively (Figure 2).

185
186

Anti-S versus anti-N antibody responses during the acute phase of infection

187

Anti-S and anti-N antibody responses were determined using four different technologies, i.e

188

Luminex, ELISA, CLIA and ECLIA. The different assays used were detecting the N protein alone,

189

the N plus a monomeric antigen of the S protein, the monomeric S protein alone and the

190

native trimeric S protein. More details about the five commercial assays used are contained

191

in the Methods. We performed the comparison on the same set of 96 sera from patients with

192

acute infection and stratified based on time between symptoms onset and sera collection as

193

shown in Figures 1B. Small differences in the number of sera tested across assays is due to

194

insufficient volume of some samples. The specificity was evaluated on a common panel of 65

195

pre-COVID-19 pandemic sera sampled before November 2019.

196

Increased sensitivity in the detection of both anti-N and anti-S IgG antibody responses was

197

observed consistently over time post-symptoms regardless of the test used (Figure 3 A-B,

198

Table 1). The use of the native trimeric S protein was associated with the higher sensitivity,

199

i.e. detection of anti-S IgG antibodies in 97% of individuals tested > Day 15 POS, as compared

200

to the use monomeric S and/or N proteins with a sensitivity ranging between 83 to 93%

201

(Figure 3 B-C, Table 1). The specificity was equal or above 97% (Figure 3 C) regardless of the

202

test and antigen used and none displayed cross-reactivity with sera from patients positive for

203

229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63 coronaviruses (Figure 1A).

204
205

Taken together, these results indicate that antibody responses targeting the S and/or the N

206

proteins have similar sensitivity during the acute phase of infection.

207
208

Comparison of anti-S and anti-N IgG antibody responses during the post-infection phase

209

We next evaluated anti-S and anti-N IgG antibody responses on 578 sera as part of a

210

population-based seroprevalence study of the Vaud Canton in Switzerland, while being blind

211

to the seropositivity status. These comparisons included 90 sera sampled from mildly to

212

paucisymptomatic patients tested positive by RT-PCR, 177 sera sampled from ‘positive patient

213

contacts’ of RT-PCR positive subjects, and 311 sera sampled from undefined, ‘random

214

selected’ people from the general population aged 6 months and over. Results of the

215

comparisons are shown in Figure 4, and Table 2. As expected, a good correlation in the

216

proportion of seropositive individuals was observed between tests detecting antibody

217

responses against the trimeric and/or monomeric S proteins while a poorer correlation was

218

observed with those detecting anti-N antibody responses (Figure 4).

219
220

With regard to the ‘RT-PCR positive’ group (n=90 individuals) (Figure 4, blue dots), the best

221

sensitivity (96.7%) was found with the use of the trimeric S protein as compared to that of

222

monomeric S and N proteins (Table 2).

223
224

Regarding ‘positive patient contact’ group (Figure 4, red dots), the highest positivity rate

225

(36.2%) was observed with the trimeric S protein while positivity rates ranged between 32.2

226

and 24.3% with the other antigenic proteins (Figure 4 and Table 2).

227
228

With regard to the ‘random selected’ group, (Figure 4, green dots; Table 2), we observed that

229

anti-S antibody responses identified greater percentages of SARS-CoV-2 positive people

230

(between 6.4 to 4.2%), than anti-N antibody responses (4.5 to 3.5%). Importantly, the pan-Ig

231

test (#6 in Table 2) using the N protein antigen was the second most sensitive assay in the

232

acute infected cohort and in the ‘RT-PCR positive’ and ‘positive patient contacts’ groups, but

233

conversely, was one of the least sensitive test (3.9%) in detecting seropositive people

234

randomly selected from the general population. The significantly higher sensitivity of the

235

trimeric S protein antigen in the post-infection setting is highlighted in Figure 5. Compared to

236

the N and or monomeric S antigens, the trimeric S protein identified 10.9% to 32.8% more

237

positive subjects in the ‘positive patient contacts’ group, 30% to 45% more positive subjects

238

in the ‘random selected’ group and 17.9% to 35.7% more positive subjects in a combined

239

analysis of the ‘positive patient contacts’ and ‘random selected’ groups. In the overall post-

240

infection cohort of 578 subjects, the trimeric S protein performed significantly better and

241

detected between 9.4% and 31% more seropositive participants than the N and/or the S

242

monomeric proteins (Figure 5).

243
244

Taken together, these results indicate that anti-N antibody responses may substantially (i.e.

245

30% to 45%) underestimate the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals compared to

246

anti-S antibody responses in population-based seroprevalence studies.

247
248

Discussion

249
250

Population-based seroprevalence studies are important to monitor the dynamics of the

251

pandemic, to have a better appreciation of the number of infections and to determine the

252

proportion of the population that has developed specific SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Population-

253

based seroprevalence studies performed in Switzerland, Spain and in New York City indicate

254

that a minor percentage of the population, ranging from 10 to 20% of individuals, has been

255

infected with SARS-CoV-2.2-4,17-19 The estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals from

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153536; this version posted July 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

256

seroprevalence studies may be substantially influenced by qualitative and quantitative

257

changes in the antibody responses from the transition from the acute to the post-infection

258

phase, the clinical severity of the infection and the antigenic protein used for the detection of

259

the antibody responses.

260

SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (predominantly IgG) targeting either the S or the N proteins

261

are generally assessed in both the acute and post-infection phases. The majority of studies

262

and the validation of the tests with regard to the sensitivity and specificity has been mostly

263

performed on cohorts from patients during the acute phase of infection.16,17,20,21 The results

264

from these studies indicate the use of N and S proteins were considered as equally sensitive,

265

with a generally higher sensitivity for the N protein to monitor the development of antibody

266

responses. Based on these observations in the acute phase of infection, it has been assumed

267

that determination of antibody responses against the N or S proteins would be equally suitable

268

in the post-infection phase for population-based seroprevalence studies. However, limited

269

information is yet available on the evolution of the antibody response during the transition

270

from the acute to the post-infection phase and, in particular, on the antibody responses

271

against the two targets, S and N proteins. Furthermore, the population-based studies

272

comprise diverse populations of individuals including RT-PCR positive individuals with

273

moderate to severe symptomatic infection who required hospitalization, RT-PCR positive

274

individuals with mild symptoms who did not require hospitalization and pauci-/asymptomatic

275

individuals with no previous RT-PCR confirmation of COVID-19 infection. Previous studies have

276

shown that the magnitude of the antibody response may be influenced by the severity of the

277

symptoms with robust antibody response in patients with severe infection while weaker

278

antibody response in patients with mild infection. Therefore, antibody responses can be lower

279

in pauci-/asymptomatic individuals. For these reasons, population-based studies can be very

280

challenging to estimate the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections in individuals who have

281

experience pauci-/asymptomatic infection.

282

Our results indicate a substantial drop in the sensitivity of antibody responses specific to the

283

N protein thus strongly suggesting a waning of these responses in the post-infection phase. In

284

this regard, the estimated seroprevalence in the ‘positive patient contacts’ and ‘random

285

selected’ groups is mostly impacted when only anti-N responses are assessed with an

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153536; this version posted July 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

286

underestimation ranging from 11 to 33% for the former and 30 to 45% for the latter group as

287

compared to anti-S trimeric responses within the same groups.

288

Of note, the underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals was also observed for

289

antibody responses against monomeric S1 or RBD and was in the range of 18-22% in the

290

‘positive patient contacts’ and 30-35% in the ‘random selected’ groups samples. The greater

291

sensitivity of antibody responses found against the trimeric S protein likely results from

292

antibodies binding to the S2 subunit and the conservation of conformational epitopes within

293

the higher order structure. This increased sensitivity was not obtained at the expense of cross-

294

reactivity, since the specificity observed using the trimeric S protein was >99%. Overall, the

295

underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals was less important in the ‘Positive RT-

296

PCR patients’ group ranging from 1 to 26%.

297

A recent study22 has shown that 40% of asymptomatic individuals became seronegative over

298

time. However, anti-N antibody responses were determined in this study. Based on our

299

results, it is likely that the loss of antibody response observed is due to the selective waning

300

of the anti-N rather antibody responses rather than to a global reduction of the SARS-CoV-2

301

antibody response.

302

Furthermore, the present findings are also important for the development appropriate

303

monitoring strategies for the evaluation and development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

304

In conclusion, these results provide new insights in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody

305

response from the acute to the post-infection phase and indicate that the detection of

306

antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to avoid large

307

underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.

Comparison of tests for acute/sub-acute phase of the infection was performed on 161 sera,
including i) 96 sera, expected to be positive, sampled from hospitalized patients with severe
to mild symptoms 0 to 45 days post onset of the symptoms and documented with a positive
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR ; ii) 65 sera, expected to be negative, sampled before November 2020,
presented as pre-COVID-19 sera, and including 18 samples from patient documented positive
for a Human coronavirus (E229, OC43, HKU1, NL63) RT-PCR. Date of the symptoms onset were
extracted from the electronic record of the 96 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive patients.

A second comparison of tests was performed on sera from the seroprevalence study of the
Vaud Canton in Switzerland (SerocoViD) performed by the Centre for Primary Care and Public
Health, University of Lausanne (Unisanté). Out of the 1,942 participants who provided a blood
sample between May 4 and June 27, 2020, a subset of 578 subjects were included in the
present analysis, of which: i) 90 subjects were expected to be positive—sampled from mostly
mildly to paucisymptomatic patients (only 21% had been hospitalized) documented with a
positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR ; ii) 177 were sampled from contacts of RT-PCR positive subjects,
and iii) 311 were randomly selected subjects in the general population. There were 304
women (52.6%), and the mean age was 39.2 years (SD 24.2, range: 6 months to 90 years).

Negative control serum samples from 256 adult healthy donors with ages ranging for 18 to 81
years of age were collected prior to November 2019 as part of the Swiss Immune Setpoint
study sponsored by Swiss Vaccine Research Institute. Specificity tests for the Luminex Sprotein assay with a diverse set of 108 patient sera included the 65 sera collected prior to
November 2019 and used in the blinded tested performed with all six assays and an additional
43 patient samples. This diverse set of samples consisted of sera from pregnant women
(n=14), pre-pandemic coronavirus infected donors (OC43, E229, NL63 and HKU1; n=19),
patients with infectious diseases (HIV, Rubella, HSV1, HSV2, CMV, EBV, influenza and varicella;
n=57) and patients with autoimmune diseases including Lupus (n=18). Study design and use
of subject sera samples were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Lausanne
University Hospital and the ‘Commission d’éthique du Canton de Vaud’ (CER-VD) stated that
authorization was not required.

Luminex beads used for the serological binding assays were prepared by covalent coupling of
SARS-CoV-2 proteins with MagPlex beads using the manufacture’s protocol with a Bio-Plex
Amine Coupling Kit (Bio-Rad, France). Briefly, 1 ml of MagPlex-C Microspheres (Luminex) were
washed with wash buffer and then resuspended in activation buffer containing a freshly
prepared solution of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and Nhydroxysulfosuccinimide (S-NHS), (ThermoFischer, USA). Activated beads were washed in PBS
followed by the addition of 50 μg of protein antigen. The coupling reaction was performed at
4 °C overnight with bead agitation using a Hula-Mixer (ThermoFischer). Beads were then
washed with PBS, resuspended in blocking buffer then incubated for 30 minutes with agitation
at room temperature. Following a final PBS washing step, beads were resuspended in 1.5 ml
of storage buffer and kept protected from light in an opaque tube at 4 °C. Each of the SARSCoV-2 proteins was coupled with different colored MagPlex beads so that tests could be
performed with a single protein bead per well or in a multiplexed Luminex serological binding
assay.

The S protein trimer was designed to mimic the native trimeric conformation of the protein in
vivo and the expression vector was kindly provided by Prof. Jason McLellan, University of
Texas, Austin; 25. It encoded the prefusion ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike with a Cterminal T4 foldon fusion domain to stabilize the trimer complex along with C-terminal 8x His
and 2x Strep tags for affinity purification. The trimeric Spike protein was transiently expressed
in suspension-adapted ExpiCHO cells (Thermo Fisher) in ProCHO5 medium (Lonza) at 5 x106
cells/mL using PEI MAX (Polysciences) for DNA delivery. At 1 h post-transfection, dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO; AppliChem) was added to 2% (v/v). Following a 7-day incubation with
agitation at 31 °C and 4.5% CO2, the cell culture medium was harvested and clarified using a
0.22 µm filter. The conditioned medium was loaded onto Streptactin (IBA) and StrepTrap HP
(Cytiva) columns in tandem, washed with PBS, and eluted with 10 mM desthiobiotin in PBS.
The purity of S protein trimer was determined to be > 99% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis.

Receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1 SARS-CoV-2 proteins were prepared as previously
described.23 In initial characterization of the assays, serum dilutions of 1/50 down to 1/ 2’700
were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive subjects and healthy donors. A 1/300 dilution of
serum was selected for screening patient samples since it showed a high MFI signal for all
donors and a low background staining with serum samples from pre-COVID-19 pandemic
healthy donors. In addition to the high positive signal and low background, <1 µl of serum was
needed to evaluate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding in the Luminex assay binding assays.

Luminex beads coupled with the Spike, RBD or S1 proteins were diluted 1/100 in PBS with 50
µl added to each well of a Bio-Plex Pro 96-well Flat Bottom Plates (Bio-Rad). Following bead
washing with PBS on a magnetic plate washer (MAG2x program), 50 µl of individual serum
samples diluted at 1/300 in PBS, were added to the plate wells. Along with samples, three
replicates of a 1/300 negative control pool of pre-COVID-19 pandemic healthy human sera
(BioWest human serum AB males; VWR) were evaluated on each 96-well plate. Plates were
sealed with adhesive film, protected from light with a dark cover and agitated at 500 rpm for
60 minutes on a plate shaker. Beads were then washed on the magnetic plate washer and
anti-human IgG-PE secondary antibody (OneLambda ThermoFisher) was added at a 1/100
dilution with 50µl per well. Plates were agitated for 45 minutes, and then washed on the
magnetic plate washer. Beads resuspended in 80 µl of reading buffer were agitated 5 minutes
at 700 rpm on the plate shaker then read directly on a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D plate reader
(ThermoFisher). MFI signal for each test serum samples was divided by the mean signal for
the negative control samples to yield an MFI ratio that normalized values between plates and
between different Luminex instruments tested. Considering that two of the three false
positives from the 364 SARS-CoV-2 negative donors had MFI signals less than 6 (Figure 1A), an
additional criteria for positivity was established for large general population screens, including
the post-infection cohort. Here, sera with signal intensities between 4 and 6 were defined as
being at the limit of positivity, which increases the assay sensitivity to 99.7% with only one
acute HIV infected subject having a 6.8 MFI signal.

The new Luminex S protein trimer IgG assay was compared with five commercially available
SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays: i) two ELISAs from EuroImmun (Test 3 S1 mono) and Epitope
Diagnostics (Test 4 N protein) detecting IgG against the S1 and N proteins, respectively, ii) two
CLIA from Diasorin (Test 1 S1 mono) and Snibe (Test 5 N protein) detecting IgG against S1
protein and N protein + S antigen peptide, respectively, and iii) a pan-Ig ECLIA from Roche
(Test 6 N protein) targeting the N protein. The Snibe assay was grouped with the N protein
assays in our analysis since it contained only a portion of the S1 protein.

ELISA and CLIA were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. EuroImmun and
Epitope Diagnostic IgG ELISA were done manually as per protocol with the exception of
washing steps performed with a microplate washer (PW40, Bio-Rad, France). Optical densities
(OD) was measured with a microplate reader (800 TSI, BioTek, USA). Each sample was
measured in duplicates. The LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 IgG kit was performed on a Liaison® XL
(Diasorin, Italy), and the MAGLUMI™ 2019-nCoV IgG and IgM kits were performed on a
MAGLUMI™ 800 (Snibe, China). The Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 was performed on a COBAS 6000
(Roche, Switzerland).

Sensitivity and specificity of the tests with 95% CI (Wilson/Brown method of GraphPad Prism
8.3.0) were calculated with Excel and GraphPad prism. For comparisons between the Luminex
assay and the five other serological assays, R2 values were calculated using the Pearson test
and the McNemar's test was used to determine the P-value significant differences for
sensitivities in detecting seropositive subjects in the patient subsets within the post-infection
cohort. All statistics were done with GraphPad prism.

Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG binding antibody responses against the native trimeric S
protein in a Luminex binding assay. Luminex beads covalently coupled with SARS-CoV-2 S
protein trimer were used to monitor IgG binding antibody responses in pre-COVID-19
pandemic negative control sera and sera from SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive donors. MFI signals
for serum antibody binding was expressed as a ratio compared to a negative control pool of
pre-COVID-19 pandemic human serum tested in parallel. A) Assay specificity was evaluated
using the sera from pre-COVID-19 pandemic healthy adults (n=256; ages ranging between 18
to 81 years of age), pregnant woman, pre-pandemic coronavirus infected donors (OC43, E229,
NL63 and HKU1), patients with infectious diseases (HIV, Rubella, HSV1, CMV, EBV, influenza
and varicella) and patients with autoimmune diseases including Lupus. B) The sensitivity of
the S protein trimer was evaluated with sera from acute infected SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive
donors at 0-5 days, 6-10 days, 11-15 days and 16-33 days post-onset of symptoms. The red
dashed line in A and B corresponds to the 4.0 cut-off for positivity in the IgG Luminex assay
that was established by using mean value + 4×SD of all 364 pre-COVID-19 pandemic serum
samples shown in A.

Figure 2: SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA binding antibody responses against the native trimeric S
protein in a Luminex binding assay. The native trimeric S protein was used to monitor IgA
binding antibodies in sera from pre-COVID-19 pandemic negative control donors and sera
from acute SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive donors. The Luminex assay exhibited high specificity of
98.5% against a cohort of negative control donors and was effective at detecting IgA
antibodies specific for S protein in most subjects in both the early stage (0 to 10 days) and
later stage (11 to 33 days) after onset of symptoms in acute PCR-positive patients. The red
dashed line corresponds to 6.5-fold MFI signal over the internal negative control and was
established by using the mean value + 4×SD of the 256 pre-COVID-19 pandemic adult serum
samples.
