The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread attention given to the
notions of “flattening the curve” during lockdowns, and successful
contact tracing programs suppressing outbreaks. However a more
nuanced picture of these interventions’ effects on epidemic trajectories is necessary. By mathematical modeling each as reactive quarantine measures, dependent on current infection rates, with different mechanisms of action, we analytically derive distinct nonlinear
effects of these interventions on final and peak outbreak size. We
simultaneously fit the model to provincial reported case and aggregated quarantined contact data from China. Lockdowns compressed
the outbreak in China inversely proportional to population quarantine rates, revealing their critical dependence on timing. Contact tracing had significantly less impact on final outbreak size, but did lead
to peak size reduction. Our analysis suggests that altering the cumulative cases in a rapidly spreading outbreak requires comprehensive
targeted measures that decrease the reproduction number close to
one, otherwise a swift lockdown may be needed.

The COVID-19 pandemic began in Wuhan, China, where
infections grew rapidly and spread throughout the country
in late December 2019 and January 2020. In order to contain the virus, drastic measures, such as travel restrictions
alongside extensive lockdowns and contact tracing efforts, were
implemented. The overall success of these control strategies
in suppressing the outbreak in China has been recognized in
several studies (1, 2). An important question is which intervention had the largest impact, or in more detail, quantifying
the effect of each intervention on case reduction. The problem
is relevant not only for retrospective analysis, as all countries
including China face the task of controlling ongoing or possible second wave outbreaks of COVID-19, along with future
emerging epidemics.
Important strategies for the fight against COVID-19 are
often classified as non-pharamaceutical interventions (NPIs)
because consensus vaccines or treatments may not be widely
available or enough effective. The effectiveness and aims of
NPIs may vary by country and type of intervention. While
the goal of large-scale lockdowns and social distancing is often
characterized as “flattening the curve”, whereas successful contact tracing may suppress outbreaks, a more nuanced picture
of their potential impact on epidemic trajectories is necessary.
A few studies have quantified impact of travel restrictions
(3, 4) and lockdowns inducing large-scale changes in contact
patterns or depletion of susceptible individuals (5, 6), showing
the efficacy of these interventions in China. Yet, the precise
qualitative and quantitative effect of brute force interventions
such as lockdowns (or widespread social distancing), versus

the more targeted strategy of contact tracing, on the outbreak
shape is less explored.
Traditionally the influence of control strategies on outbreaks
has been theoretically investigated in compartmental ordinary differential equation models of the susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) type. Analysis yields the herd immunity (or
critical vaccination) threshold for suppressing an outbreak by
proportionally reducing the effective reproduction number, Re ,
below one, along with a nonlinear relationship between Re
and final outbreak size when Re is above one. Furthermore,
inference of parameters by fitting the model to data can help
to determine the effect of interventions. However both the
analytical and parameter estimation approaches are challenged
by the dynamic nature of control strategies as public health
authorities and individuals react to an evolving outbreak.
While the early phase of COVID-19 can be characterized
by exponential growth, case saturation occurred much earlier than would be predicted by the basic SIR model due to
the comprehensive control measures that have been deployed.
In particular, stringent lockdown with broad (self- and contact tracing) quarantine interventions reduced the pool of
susceptible individuals, effective contact rate and secondary
transmissions. Several models have utilized time-dependent
transmission or isolation rates to capture the dynamics (3, 7),
and recent work has also considered removal of susceptible
individuals at a constant rate (6). Here we develop a generalized SIR-type model incorporating a total (government
mandated and individual) self-quarantine rate, along with
contact tracing, both depending on force of infection, to fit an
observed reactionary public health system and derive novel
formulae for outbreak size.
To quantify the impacts of contact tracing and comprehensive social distancing (self-quarantine or lockdowns), we
simultaneously utilize case and quarantined contact data from
China to estimate parameters in our model. Furthermore,
through computational and theoretical analysis of the model,
we can explore the sensitivity of distinct epidemic measures
(e.g. outbreak size, peak number of infected, timing and extent of self-quarantine) to interpretable control parameters.
These investigations allow us to dissect how combinations of
NPIs, such as contact tracing and lockdowns, may influence
sequential outbreaks through loosening and tightening of control measures. The emergent picture is of distinct qualitative
impacts of contact tracing and lockdowns on the outbreak,
variable in scope and timing, and dependent on underlying
disease parameters. A better understanding of these differen-

Model with Self-Quarantine and Contact Tracing
We formulate a SEIR model (Fig.1 and generalized equations
are given in SI Appendix), which modifies a detailed differential equation system of contact tracing during outbreaks
(8). The model variables include: susceptible (S), exposed
(E) and infectious (I) individuals; social-distanced (or selfquarantined) susceptible (Sq ), exposed (Eq ) and infectious (Iq )
individuals; contact-traced susceptible (Sc ), exposed (Ec ), and
infectious (Ic ) individuals; and the decoupled compartments of
(safely) isolated reported cases (R) with a subset of currently
quarantined contact-traced cases (Rc ). The full system of
equations is given in the SI Appendix. Here we highlight a
few key model features and parameters (Table 1). Parameters
β, βc , and βq represent transmission rates of non-quarantined,
contact-traced quarantined and self-quarantined infected individuals, respectively, where βc and βq reflect reductions
in transmission due to contact tracing and social distancing
which are generally imperfect (e.g. tracing individual after
they become infectious, looseness in following stay-at-home
orders). A critical control parameter is the total rate of susceptible transition to (contact-traced or self-) quarantine state,
ψλS, with dimensionless constant ψ = 1−p
φ + σ, proportional
p
to force of infection λ = (βI + βq Iq + βc Ic )/N , where φ is
proportion of contacts traced, p is probability of transmission upon contact and σ is the self-quarantine factor. The
dependence on force of infection reflects mechanism of contact
tracing (8), along with the responsive nature of broader social distancing/quarantine measures to current transmission.
Other important parameters include αq , the rate of return to
susceptible from social distancing, and νq the susceptibility
of self-quarantined individuals measuring the looseness of the
social distancing measures.
A simplified version of the model assuming perfect indefinite
quarantine and perfect contact tracing is given by the following

Reproduction Number and Outbreak Size
The reproduction numbers, R0,b and R0 , (baseline and after
contact tracing) of the “perfect quarantine” model Eq. (1) are:
R0,b = βT and R0 = R0,b (1 − φ).

ln (U∞ ) = R0 (U∞ − 1) ,
Ypeak =
[1]

[2]

We also consider (time-dependent) effective reproduction number Re = (S(t)/N ) R0 , calculated continuously during the
outbreak. The Re for the full model (Fig. 1) depends upon
the quarantined populations Sq (t) and Sc (t), along with their
imperfect susceptibility and transmission parameters (νq , νc
and βq , βc ) and is formulated in SI Appendix.
Next we present novel analytical relations between R0 , selfquarantine rate and final or peak outbreak size. We assume
an indefinite quarantine period (αq = 0), as in Eq. (1). In
this way, the outbreak size can represent magnitude of first,
second or subsequent waves dependent on contact tracing
and self-quarantine parameters. Define the final proportion
of susceptible individuals U∞ = S(∞)
, the final (cumulative)
S(0)
R∞
epidemic size C∞ = 0 (I(t) + Ic (t) + Iq (t))dt, and peak
non-quarantined infected (and exposed) individuals Ypeak :=
maxt>0 (E(t) + I(t)). Under simplifying conditions, we derive
the final size of U∞ and C∞ dependent on the (assumed)
uniform susceptibility of self-quarantined and contact-traced
individuals, ν (detailed in SI Appendix). In the best case
scenario where self-quarantine or contact tracing perfectly
prevents susceptible infection (ν = 0), we obtain the exact
formulae:

where R (fit to data) is decoupled, and the additional decoupled compartments of self-quarantined and contact-traced (fit
to data) are detailed in the SI. Note that for superior analytical
results and model identifiability, for simplicity we assume that
2

the infectious and exposed period (T and τ ) remain constant.
This can be interpreted as averaging an evolving serial interval (e.g. due to improving non-pharmaceutical interventions
(9)) over the outbreak timeframe (see also SI Appendix for
alternative non-constant serial interval model and fitting).

where ψ depends on self-quarantine factor (σ) and R0 depends
on contact tracing proportion (φ). Note that each formula can
account for arbitrary initial conditions in order to quantify
how Re and quarantine measures affect outbreak or peak size
beginning at any stage (see SI Appendix for formal derivations).

In Eq. (3), note the classical relation between final or peak
outbreak size and R0 when ψ = 0. Self-quarantine (σ) is
expected to have almost all weight in the total susceptible
quarantine factor (ψ = σ + φ(1 − p)/p) because the goal of
lockdowns, as opposed to contact tracing (φ), is to shield
large segments of susceptible population. Thus both final
and peak outbreak size, Ypeak and C∞ , have a simple inverse
proportionality relationship with σ. In contrast, contact tracing, primarily acting through the proportional reduction in
baseline reproduction number (R0 = (1 − φ)R0,b ), has distinct influences on peak and final size. We calculate relative
sensitivities of Eq. (3)-Eq. (4) to ψ and φ,

Observe that as R0 increases, contact tracing has more influence on peak size, but less impact on final size, where relative
rate of change of C∞ with respect to φ goes to zero as R0
becomes large.
Although there are inherent issues with measuring rate of
new incidence due to the delay between transmission and case
reporting, the inverse proportions dependent on susceptible
quarantine factor (ψ) can be used as a simple retrospective
or implementation guide for lockdown efficacy. For instance,
given that ψ is relative to force of infection, to reduce the
outbreak size by 90% (compared to no lockdown case ψ ≈
0), the authorities would need to have implemented strict

Note that R0,b is the ratio of force of infection ( βI
) and
N
reported prevalence rate ( NIT ). Thus, as a rule of thumb,
the quarantine rate (or magnitude in a defined time period)
must be 9 × R0,b times the rate (or amount) of incoming
reported cases to reduce the outbreak size by 90%. In practice,
officials may look at aggregated cell phone or mobility data to
assess population quarantine behavior and compare with case
reports. Quarantine rate may need to far exceed the pace of
new infections, as shown below, very large values of ψ were
instrumental for China rapidly curbing their epidemic.

Data Fitting & Distinct Quarantine Efficacies in China
In order to quantify relative efficacies of contact tracing and
self-quarantine (lockdown) interventions during the COVID19 outbreak in China, we simultaneously fit our models to
daily reported case data and (daily number of) quarantined
contacts from daily reports by NHC (10). The outbreak was
not localized to a single population during the timeframe of
our study, Jan. 21- Mar. 19 2020, although the province of
Hubei had a large share of the total cases. For each province in
China we fit model Eq. (1) to daily case incidence, along with
an inferred number of quarantined contacts, weighting the
available aggregated quarantine contact data for all of China
by province reported case load distributed by an assumed
exponential quarantine duration of mean 14 days (see SI
Appendix). To increase model identifiability, we reduced the
number of parameters by fixing the incubation period (time
to infectiousness, τ = 3 days (11)), infectious period (time to
isolation, T = 4.64 days (12)), and probability of transmission
given contact, p = .06, in line with other studies (12, 13).
The province model fits (see SI table S4, figures S8,S9) can
largely be summarized by separating daily incidence into Hubei

Next, we observe an inverse proportionality relationship
between province outbreak size and corresponding estimated
self-quarantine factor (σ), supporting theoretical predictions of
our final size formula Eq. (3) (Fig. 3). Indeed, the 30 provincial
cumulative case counts over the study period are inversely
proportional to fitted σ values, whereas contact tracing (φ)
did not have a significant correlation with province outbreak
size. This inverse relationship was also true of province peak
size versus self-quarantine factor, but contact tracing had
a larger impact here than for the case of cumulative cases,

and China less Hubei. Thus we refined our analysis by fitting
their two corresponding daily reported case datasets and the
sum of their respective quarantine contact compartments to
the aggregated China daily quarantine contacts (Fig. 2). The
estimated basic reproduction numbers (with contact tracing)
are R0 = 4.07 (CI 3.54 − 4.12) and R0 = 2.47 (CI 2.16 − 2.77)
for Hubei and China less Hubei, respectively. Complete parameter values and uncertainty analysis are presented in SI
Appendix. We also calculate time-dependent Re by directly
utilizing the daily case data and estimates of the serial interval (generation time) distribution (8, 12, 14), alongside
Re obtained from our estimated parameters from model fitting. Although China less Hubei had larger contact tracing
level than Hubei (φ = 0.59 versus φ = 0.32), possibly due to
smaller caseloads, it also had significantly higher estimates of
self-quarantine rate (σ = 1.14×105 versus σ = 1.26×103 ) likely
attributed to the speed advantage in reacting to the initial
outbreak in Hubei in addition to their local cases. The results
indicate strict population-wide lockdowns were the main quarantine measure (as opposed to contact tracing) which rapidly
contained the outbreak in China by rapidly decreasing Re (see
Figs. 2(a),2(b)).

as illustrated by distinctly flatter peak size sensitivity curves
(with respect to varying σ) for provinces with larger proportion
of contacts traced, φ. The small effect of contact tracing on
final size, but larger influence on peak size, concurs with
our derived sensitivity analysis when R0 is relatively large.
To further corroborate the heterogeneous impacts of contact
tracing, we calculate outbreak sizes if φ = 0, finding peak
infection reductions of 28% in Hubei versus 45% in China less
Hubei. However, the decrease in final outbreak size due to
contact tracing was only 1.6% (Hubei) and 5.6% (China less
Hubei), respectively.
A change in case counting procedures around Feb. 12 in
Hubei province prevented us from reliably fitting daily case
counts in this province from Feb. 11-Feb. 13, and thus we also
performed our fitting procedure on cumulative cases, rather
than daily incidence, in order to obtain an overall picture of
the total outbreak in China. The initial amount of infected
individuals, I0 , was estimated at 778 on January 21, 2020,
when the dataset begins around the time when major lockdowns began (e.g. a cordon sanitaire implemented in Hubei
province on Jan. 23). However our force-of-infection (λ) dependent rate formulation of mass self-quarantine (σλ) actually
allows for a similar epidemic trajectory when instead initiating
the model a month earlier with one infected individual (see
SI Appendix Fig. S1). Furthermore, we verified robustness
of our parameter estimations and results by fitting the full
model ((1) in SI Appendix and Fig.1) simultaneously to cumulative reported cases and daily quarantined contacts in
all China, along with exploring alternative formulations of
self-quarantine rate (e.g using mobility data) and different
quarantine/infection residence time distributions, and decreasing infectious periods due to lockdowns (see SI Appendix).

Fig. 4. Sensitivity analysis of contact tracing and self-quarantine. All together the figures illustrate how contact tracing (φ) has less impact on outbreak size (C∞ ) than self-quarantine (σ ) due to
underlying concavity of their nonlinear relationships derived in final size formula Eq. (3). Fitted parameter values for total cumulative cases in China show that rapidly implemented lockdowns contained
the outbreak, where a delay of 2 weeks in 95% of susceptible population being self-quarantined would result in a 10-fold increase in cumulative cases. Although contact tracing had little effect (2%)
on final outbreak size, it “flattened the curve”, reducing peak infected by 34%. (a) Contact tracing (CT) proportion φ versus outbreak size C∞ (nonlinear relationship) and reproduction number R0

(e,f) Contour maps of outbreak size and peak infected (with time to peak inserted) depending on CT proportion φ and SQ rate σ .

Despite the various modeling assumptions and the inconsistencies in the reported case data, our results on how contact
tracing and self-quarantine/lockdown measures affected outbreak and peak size were robust (see SI Appendix for full
details).
Sensitivity analysis on the main control parameters for the
all China fit (Fig. 4) reveals minimal contact tracing level
impact on final outbreak size, yet larger effect on reducing
peak infection levels (Fig. 4(g)), concurring with our analytical
calculations (Eq. (3),Eq. (4), Eq. (5), Eq. (6)) and results when
fitting province daily incidence. In general, we observe that the
time to peak increases with φ, reflecting the curve flattening,
however this time period eventually decreases for sufficiently
large values of φ as contact tracing effectively suppresses the
outbreak (Fig. S7). In addition, with sufficiently large contact
tracing coverage, outbreak size can be significantly reduced
when there is less stringent lockdown (less total quarantined
and more time to enact quarantine). Yet even in this case,
some level of broader social distancing measures is almost
certainly needed in combination with contact tracing.
As predicted by our derived inverse proportionality relationship Eq. (3), there are escalating costs as σ decreases, i.e. as
self-quarantine action lessens relative to ongoing infection rate
(Fig 4(e)). For example, if the estimated time for 50% of initial
susceptible population of China to be self-quarantined (∼ 2
weeks from Jan. 21) had been delayed by just one week, then

the total number of cases would be approximately 10 times
larger (Fig. 4(f)). In the full model, the additional parameters
νq , βq (measuring looseness of the lockdown) also impacts the
outbreak size (Fig. 4(e)). Going from νq , βq /β ≈ 0 (as predicted for China) to νq = βq /β = 0.05 to νq = βq /β = 0.15,
the outbreak size would increase by a factor of 1.14 and 1.45,
respectively. In addition, the estimated exit rate from selfquarantine (αq ) for China was estimated to be very small,
emphasizing the strictness of the lockdown.

Quarantine Interventions for COVID-19 2nd Wave
A major question is how lockdown measures should be loosened after some level of controling COVID-19, while optimally
responding to any subsequent outbreaks induced by the relaxations. Here we analyze how the scale and rate of different
reactive contact-based interventions affect 2nd wave outbreaks
under two different scenarios of loosening, namely Instantaneous Return of Several Sectors (IRSS) or via Gradual Return
of Self-Quarantined (GRSQ). The goal is to attain qualitative insights on strategies for shrinking, flattening or delaying
(not necessarily independent phenomena (15)) subsequent outbreaks. By varying self-quarantine factor σ, contact tracing
probability φ and looseness of social distancing ν under the
distinct relaxation policies in our model parameterized to data
from China, we observe potential consequences of different

Fig. 5. Combined impact of contact tracing and responsive social distancing (self-quarantine) measures under distinct re-opening strategies. Model simulations predict 2nd wave outbreak shape after
instantaneous re-normalization of several sectors (IRSS) by releasing 80% of self-quarantined (a,b,c) versus gradual return of self-quarantined (GRSQ) to normalcy (d,e,f). Increased contact tracing
levels (φ) can flatten or suppress (when highly effective) subsequent outbreak in (a,d). Social distancing measures responsive to new incidence shrink the outbreak size dependent on rate (σ ) and
looseness (νq ) of self-quarantine in (b,e) and (c,f), respectively. In addition to the differential effects on daily infected counts of contact tracing and responsive self-quarantine (flattening versus crushing),
observe the much longer delay in 2nd wave under the GRSQ re-opening policy, which can buy time for effective treatments or vaccines.

measures.
Simulating the instantaneous return of 80% of selfquarantined individuals (IRSS strategy), with no change in
parameters (and crucially the same “reactive lockdown” factor
σ) we observe that the cumulative number of infected cases for
the 2nd wave (outbreak size) and peak infected was 75% and
58%, respectively, of the 1st wave. Furthermore, a similar number of individuals as during the first wave lockdown re-enter
self-quarantine about 6 weeks after relaxation (see Fig.5(a)).
When the contact tracing efforts are enhanced after lockdown
(to φ = .65), outbreak size and peak infected are 54% and 16%,
respectively, of the 1st wave, and the curve is flattened, i.e.
the peak outbreak size shrunk and the time to peak outbreak
size increased. When contact tracing is doubled to φ = 0.75,
or if other non-quarantine measures (e.g. face mask usage)
reduce R0,b to 3 and φ = 0.5, the 2nd wave outbreak size and
peak infected are 25% and 3%, respectively, of the 1st wave. In
addition, the number of individuals re-entering self-quarantine
was reduced, revealing that contact tracing can be an effective
tool for managing the epidemic with a less stringent lockdown.
In the case of GRSQ strategy, after containing initial
outbreak with lockdown, we increase the return to "normalcy" rate to α = 0.01, where half the social-distanced return to normalcy in the approximate half-life time given by
t1/2 = ln 2/α = 72 days. Assuming other parameters remain
constant (including the reactive SQ factor σ) the second peak,
emerging with a 100 day delay, reduced to 42% of the first
wave, however the number of infected individuals settle into
a rather large quasi-equilibrium resulting in more cumulative
cases (see Fig.5(d)). Here there is a balance of force of infection induced self-quarantine (σλ) and reversion of individuals
to their normal contact behavior (α), leading to an insufficient

amount of population social distancing for reducing cases below a certain level. On the other hand, after loosening the
lockdown, when the contact tracing efforts are enhanced or
doubled, the peak size significantly diminished (27% or 0.3%
of 1st wave), along with the number of self-quarantined. Importantly, for about 6 months (or the whole year in the case of
doubling φ), the number of infected cases stayed significantly
low. This suggests that gradual release of self-quarantined
individuals with increasing contact tracing efforts can be used
as a strategy to gain time until vaccination, while reinstating
societal interactions in a carefully measured stepwise fashion.
Responsive re-implementation of lockdown (or social distancing) measures is crucial for reducing any second wave
outbreak. Reduction in SQ factor σ by 1/2 (or 1/4), as predicted simply by the inverse proportionality in the derived
final size formula Eq. (3), results in twice (or four times) more
cumulative cases for the 2nd wave, and the simulations show
the same relations between peak size (see Fig.5(b)). Although
the number of self-quarantined individuals eventually become
the same with the different SQ rates, the delay in implementing large-scale self-quarantine (in response to incidence) makes
significant differences in the final (and peak) outbreak size.
For the simulations presented in Fig. 5(b), a delay of just
9 days from the baseline parameter case results in twice as
many infections, and a delay of 18 days induces four times
the infected individuals. Compared to instantaneous release,
the increased quarantine exit rate (α) under gradual return
resulted in larger (but delayed) peak and total outbreak size
inversely proportional to declines in SQ factor σ (see Fig.5(e)).
Finally, varying the looseness of the quarantine (measured
by uniform susceptibility and infectivity values νq = βq /β)
from perfect quarantine to 25% (or to 50%) looseness, leads to

approximately 1.3 times (or to 2 times) more total and peak
infections during the outbreak. Different from the rate of SQ,
the proportionality relations are nonlinear, thus a slight looseness in social distancing can still offer an effective intervention,
but the cases will increase at a growing rate as the measures
become less strict (see Fig.5(c),5(f)).

Discussion
In this study, we compare how two distinct types of contactbased interventions, namely contact tracing and large-scale
lockdowns/self-quarantine (or social distancing), impact single
or sequential COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that contact
tracing generally is less effective in decreasing outbreak size
for rapidly spreading pathogens (high baseline reproduction
number R0,b ), unless the tracing is very efficient and large
scale, or combined with other measures to force R0 ≈ 1.
On the other hand, widespread lockdowns/social distancing
interventions can lower outbreak size inversely proportional
to an increase in the rate of self-quarantine. Our analysis
indicates that China benefited from the heavy influence of
lockdowns by rapidly containing the quickly growing COVID19 cases, and, despite massive efforts, contact tracing was less
influential in bringing down the epidemic.
Despite the difference in the targeted nature of contact
tracing versus the more indiscriminate lockdown measures,
we contend there is a similar reactive quality to both control
strategies. Contact tracing reacts to reported cases by tracking and (to varying degrees) quarantining individuals whom
have been contacted. Mass social distancing or self-quarantine
reflects a natural response by both governments and individuals that intensifies as cases build, a phenomenon that has
been labeled as “exponential whiplash” (16). These features
motivate us to construct a COVID-19 model with both contact
tracing (mechanistically) and self-quarantine (phenomenologically) dependent on force of infection. In contrast to another
model that assumes a linear rate of self-quarantine (6), the
nonlinear social distancing rate captures a contagion-like behavioral response to infected cases, and allows us to derive
novel formulae for final outbreak size. Furthermore the model
provides a good simultaneous fit to both daily reported case
and quarantined contact data from China.
An important distinction between contact tracing and lockdowns is their mode of action, namely preventing onward
secondary infections by early tracking of likely infected cases
in the former and large-scale depletion (or shielding) of susceptible individuals for the latter. This contrast determines how
they affect the major epidemiological quantities of reproduction number and outbreak size in our “transmission-reactive”
formulation. In particular, contact tracing proportionally
reduces R0 , akin to vaccination, leading to a nonlinear relationship with final outbreak size, which decreases substantially
only as R0 approaches one. The responsive self-quarantine
factor does not affect R0 , and we derive a simple inverse proportionality with outbreak size. This can be translated to a
time of action for quarantine measures, analytically demonstrating the escalating impacts of delaying implementation of
responsive lockdowns beyond a critical time period, which has
been observed in other studies via simulation (17, 18). Even
though similar levels of self-quarantine would eventually be
reached in our model as incidence grows, the cost of delays
can result in a large excess of cases.
Browne et al.

Our main result on differential impacts of lockdowns and
contact tracing also implicates distinct metrics for officials
to monitor when enacting each intervention. For reactive
lockdowns, the key measurement is rate of population-wide
quarantine compared to incidence or incoming reported cases.
For contact tracing, Re may be the important quantity because
the final outbreak size is only substantially altered as Re
becomes closer to 1. Although we find that the extensive
lockdowns were a much larger factor in controlling COVID-19
outbreak size in China, our sensitivity analysis shows that
contact tracing did dampen and delay peak number of infected
despite its more limited impact on the cumulative count. In
this way, contact tracing flattened the incidence curve, easing
the strain on limited hospital resources. A combination of
expeditiously enacted contact-based interventions may be the
best strategy, where effective contact tracing and responsive
social distancing measures can synergistically and efficiently
suppress an outbreak. However COVID-19 has proved to be
a particular challenge and large-scale lockdowns have been a
needed antidote for controlling outbreaks in several countries.
Drastic self-quarantine orders can also reduce case numbers
to manageable levels that allow for effective contact tracing
after easing restrictions.
The capacity to respond to the continuing threat of COVID19 will be vital for minimization of sequential epidemic waves.
We investigated control measures under an instantaneous
normalization of contact for a large portion (or several sectors) of the population versus a more gradual release of selfquarantined individuals back into social interactions. Our
results show that increased contact tracing efforts can alter
the second outbreak shape, either reducing and spreading
out the number of infected or completely suppressing cases
for highly efficient tracing. Social distancing or lockdown
measures responsive to incidence can effectively compress the
second peaks, with the timing being critical again. Either measure will depend upon sufficient case detection and reporting,
highlighting the importance of testing. Furthermore, indefinite
or reoccurring strict lockdowns are likely to impart too high of
an economic cost, and our model shows that looser restrictions
and contact tracing can still control a second wave. Additionally, the strategy of gradual release of quarantined sectors can
substantially delay the second wave, possibly buying time for
effective treatments or vaccines to be developed.
A major part of this work was to incorporate data on the
quarantined contacts compiled for all of China. Obtaining
provincial quarantine records or more detailed contact tracing
data quantifying the proportion of reported cases whom were
traced can allow for superior accuracy in estimating efficacy
of contact tracing. A recent study of detailed contact tracing records in Hunan province of China (13) did come to a
similar conclusion as our work that lockdowns had larger impact, and contact tracing alone is not likely to be sufficient for
controlling COVID-19. The results here explain the differential effects that contact tracing and reactive population-wide
self-quarantine have on reducing cumulative cases in a rapid
spreading outbreak. This knowledge and further investigation
may offer insights for the public health response to COVID-19.
