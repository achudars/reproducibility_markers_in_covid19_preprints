Abstract
Aim: To determine association between clinical outcome of COVID-19 and prior usage of
cardiovascular and metabolic drugs, including, Aspirin, ACEIs, ARBs, Clopidogrel, metformin,
and Statins.
Methods: Statistical examination of the demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging features
of 353 patients with SARS-CoV-2 disease admitted from February to April 2020.
Result: Minor discrepancies were observed in the clinical presentations, radiologic involvement
and laboratory results across groups of patients under treatment with specific drugs. Aspirinusers had better clinical outcome with lower need of ventilation support, whereas, metforminusers had increased chance of intubation and of mortality.
Conclusion: Although not being conclusive, our findings suggest the possibility of the effect of
previous drug usages on the various presentations and clinical course of COVID-19 infection.

Introduction
Late 2019, is marked by the emergence of a new type of beta-coronavirus, which soon led to a
disastrous outbreak of the so-called SARS-CoV-2 disease [1]. The outbreak was coined as a
global pandemic by WHO in March 2020 after countries world-wide got involved [2]. By May
2020, more than four million known cases of the disease and about three hundred thousand of
deaths were reported globally by the 116th WHO situation report.

Due to the notable death toll of SARS-CoV-2, risk factors that predispose patients to mortality
and more severe forms of the disease are under investigation. It has been well observed that
individuals burdened with hypertension, diabetes or ischemic heart disease are at higher risk of
developing severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, or of mortality due to the infection [3-5].
Although it is reasonable to maintain drugs that high-risk patients take due to their chronic
medical conditions, there are certain considerations about their safety during COVID-19
infection. For instance, statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may actually worsen
the outcome of COVID-19 patients, who, due to their underlying diseases, have poorer prognosis
[6]. On the other hand, certain drugs that are used in similar conditions are thought to have a
protective effect against the novel coronavirus. For example, metformin has been suggested to be
added as an adjuvant therapy to diabetic, old, and even obese patients’ treatment for the sake of
better outcome in COVID-19 setting [7].
Therefore, we conducted a study based on our registry of COVID-19 patients to evaluate the
effect of those drugs, which are widely used in chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes
mellitus and ischemic heart disease, on the clinical outcome and mortality rate of the patients
inflicted with the novel coronavirus.

Materials & Methods
Study Design and participants
In a retrospective cross-sectional study at Shariati Hospital in Tehran, Iran, we included all
patients admitted with the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on the criteria published by WHO on
January 12th, 2020 [8], from February 25th, 2020, to April 21st, 2020. Patients with respiratory
symptoms and one of the following were admitted: 1) loss of consciousness, 2) Respiratory rate

more than 24, 3) pulse rate more than 90, 4) Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, 5)
abnormal respiratory sounds, or 6) O2 saturation less than 93%. Furthermore, high-risk patients
with respiratory symptoms or fever underwent computed tomography scans of the lung (CT
scans). In case of a suggestive lung CT scan of COVID-19 infection, the patients were
transferred to the COVID ward. Patients with a negative lung CT scan underwent further
workup. Patients who were already admitted to the hospital were transferred to the COVID ward
if they experienced COVID-19 infection during hospitalization. We used the census sampling
method, and after exclusion of cases with missed data, four hundred and four patients were
selected. Two radiologists reviewed all the images and patients with not suggestive lung CT scan
and negative SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR were excluded. We extracted clinical data, laboratory
findings, and lung CT scans from the remaining three hundred fifty-four patients’ medical
records. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tehran University of Medical
Sciences. The ethics committee waived the requirement for informed patient consent for this
retrospective study subject to the anonymity of patients.
Measurements
The variables recorded are given in Table 1.
The q-SOFA score was calculated for all patients, and a patient with q-SOFA Score ≥2 was
categorized as high risk [9].
Outcomes included days of hospital stay, intubation, ICU admission, and in-hospital death.
Statistical analysis

Categorical variables were described in frequencies and percentages. Quantitative variables were
described with the mean (Standard deviation (SD)) or median and [Q1 – Q3]. Parametric and

nonparametric tests, including t-test and Mann-Whitney test for comparing quantitative variables
and Chi-squared test for comparing categorical variables were used. In a first step, variables
showing associations at a significance level of α=0.20 in a univariable logistic models were
selected for inclusion in the multivariable logistic model for adjustment. Statistical analyses were
performed using Stata (Corp. 2009. Stata Statistical Software: Release 11. College Station, TX:
StataCorp LP.). Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Results
General Findings

Our study was based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging data of 353 patients admitted with
COVID-19. The majority of patients were males, with 203 (57.51%) cases out of 353. The
distribution of patients in different age groups showed an increase in prevalence with respect to
age, with patients older than 65-years compromising 45% of all cases. There were 21 (7.87%)
severely obese patients with body mass index (BMI) >35.
With respect to the past medical history of cases, there were 129 (36.54%) patients with
hypertension, 111 (31.44%) with history of diabetes, 91 (25.78%) with ischemic heart disease,
and 75 (21.25%) individuals with no notable underlying disease. Less frequent medical
conditions were cancer (45, 12.75%), hyperlipidaemia (18, 5.10%), thyroid disorders (16,
4.53%), organ transplantation (9, 2.55%), history of seizure (3, 0.85%), and multiple sclerosis (3,
0.85%). There was no HIV-positive patient recorded in our dataset.
At the two extremes of the spectrum of the clinical manifestations, it is noteworthy that 10
(2.83%) patients were found to be clinically asymptomatic, whereas 31 (8.78%) cases had a
decreased level of consciousness upon admission. Considering the cardinal signs and symptoms
of the disease, there were 198 (56.09%) cases with the subjective report of dyspnea, 178

(50.42%) with fever, and 177 (50.14%) with coughing. Other recorded manifestations of the
disease were weakness (145, 41.08%), tachycardia (127, 37.03%), myalgia (65, 18.41%) nausea
(44, 12.46%), tachypnea (43, 12.46%), anorexia (39, 11.05%), chest pain (26, 7.37%), chills (23,
6.52%), diarrhoea (18, 5.10%), sore throat (16, 4.53%), headache (15, 4.25%), coryza (8,
2.27%), and anosmia (1, 0.28%). Here, we can note more specific clinical findings. From the
total number of 348 patients with recorded core body temperature, there were 94 (27.01%) and
17 (4.89%) cases with 37.8-39 °C and >39 °C respectively. Majority of patients (154, 44.27%)
had borderline blood oxygenation (90-96%) measured by pulse oximetry, while 132 cases
(37.93%) had normal and 62 cases (17.82%) had low blood oxygenation, out of 348 total
recorded cases. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the most patients were found to be
in normal range upon admission.
The most notable laboratory findings were abnormal serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
levels (50.56%; 136 out of 269), positive C-reactive protein (CRP) (50%; 157 out of 314),
lymphopenia (44.44%, 108 out of 243), abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (Alk-p) level
(41.83%; 110 out of 265) thrombocytopenia (31.33%; 104 out of 332), proteinuria (38.55%; 64
out of 166), and raised level of serum creatinine (35.84%; 119 out of 332).
There were 239 patients with abnormalities in their lung CT-scan, of whom 220 had different
types of ground-glass opacities. Other forms of reported radiologic involvement were mixed
pattern (118), reticular pattern (65), and honeycomb pattern (1). Involvements were more
frequent in the lower lobes of both right and left lungs
From the total patients, 95 (26.84%) patients were Intubated and 28 (7.91%) supported by noninvasive ventilation whereas 64 (18.08%) of infected patients care without any support. The
mean days of patient’s hospitalization were 5.98 ± 5.87 (± Standard deviation).

Specific-Drug categories
Six sub-groups of patients were defined with respect to their drug histories. Each sub-group
included patients who were under treatment with one of the following drugs or drug classes:
aspirin, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs), statins, clopidogrel, and metformin. The comprehensive information of these subgroups is presented in detail in Table 2.
We explored data in our registry to find notable correlations of drug use with different aspects of
COVID-19. With regards to the clinical manifestations of the disease it is noteworthy that, as our
data suggests, previous use of aspirin is correlated with decreased level of consciousness upon
admission (p < 0.05), and on the other hand, patients who were under treatment with ACEIs are
more probable to be symptom-free (p < 0.05).
Radiologic involvement of the lungs showed a quite specific pattern with respect to the drug
used (Table 3). Ground-glass opacities were more common in those receiving ARBs (p < 0.05)
and ACEI (p < 0.05), consolidations with statins (p < 0.05), and emphysema and its severity with
clopidogrel (p < 0.05) and metformin (p = 0.005) respectively. Chest lymphadenopathies were
more probable in the setting of using aspirin (p < 0.005), Clopidogrel (p < 0.005), and ACEI (p <
0.05). Specific localization pattern of lung involvement was concomitant with the usage of
metformin and ACEI. Metformin usage is correlated with the involvement of left lung lower lobe
(p < 0.05), whereas ACEI usage is associated with right lung involvements, revealed by its
correlation with the upper lobe involvement (p < 0.05) and lower lobe involvement score (p <
0.05).

Correlations between the pattern of laboratory results and drug usage were detected in our study.
Notable findings were the association of aspirin with elevated levels of d-dimer (p < 0.05), ARBs
with the elevated levels of cardiac troponin I (CTNI) (p < 0.05), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p
< 0.05) and lactate (p < 0.05), ACEI with the elevated level of LDH (p < 0.05), metformin with
high levels of CTNI (p < 0.005) and amylase (p < 0.05), and Clopidogrel with high levels of
amylase (p = 0.005).
After conducting the analysis, the clinical data of about 100 other patients were added to our
database. We re-evaluated our data and re-analysed them. The results were totally consistent
with what is presented here and no significant change was found to exclude any of the previous
results. However, it is noteworthy that these new analyses suggested that there is a correlation
between the usage of statins and aspirin with having a normal white blood cell and lymphocyte
count upon admission. Results are not shown.
The outcome of patients, including mortality, ventilation requirement and ICU admission
showed no correlation with receiving ARBs, ACEIs, statins, or Clopidogrel. However, aspirinusers were more likely to need no ventilation support (p = 0.05), whereas, metformin-usage were
more associated with the chance of intubation in the course of hospitalization (p < 0.05) and also
of the mortality (p < 0.05). Details are shown in Table 4.

Discussion
There are many studies showing positive and negative effects of drugs like statins, ACEI, ARBS,
metformin. and anti-platelets. We have shown that COVID-19 patients receiving these drugs
prior to admission were neither better nor worse regarding their outcomes. In theory, there are at
least 4 reasons statins might be useful for COVID-19 patients. First, cardiovascular disease is the

most significant risk factor (10-15% case fatality rate)[10] for severe COVID-19, therefore, these
patients would likely already benefit from their use. Second, a number of cardiovascular
complications such as thrombosis and myocarditis have been reported in association with this
disease and statins might be beneficial in preventing them. Third, statins might have a role in
protecting innate immune responses to viral respiratory infections (including to SARS-CoV-2)
via inhibiting the MYD88 pathway. Usually, statins do not change the level of MYD88, they
only keep its level in a normal range during hypoxia and stress [11]. And last but not least,
epidemiological studies have shown that statins may prevent severe viral pneumonias [12].
A study conducted in Belgium reported that nursing home residents taking a statin were three
times more likely to be free of symptoms of COVID-19 during their infection than those who did
not. Length of admission and death was also slightly less in those receiving statins, even though
the difference was not significant statistically [13].
We have shown that statins did not protect COVID-19 patients from having worse outcomes,
although those receiving statins probably had baseline cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes
which could have worsened their prognosis per se. Statins have been widely prescribed with a
good safety index.
Data on anti-platelets such as aspirin and clopidogrel and their effects on COVID-19 are scarce.
We didn’t find any significant difference in outcomes in our patients. However, thrombosis
remains a major complication of this disease and trails on anticoagulants are showing promise.
Zhang P. et al. conducted a retrospective, multicentre study of 1,128 COVID-19 patients with
hypertension in which 188 were taking ACEI/ARBs. They concluded that these patients had a
lower all-cause mortality compared to those not receiving ACEI/ARBs [14].

Physiological models of SARS-CoV infection have shown a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARBs,
however, this benefit cannot be attributed to SARS-CoV-2. Cardiology associations such as the
ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected this hypothesis. A
commentary published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine even proposed that ACEI might
increase the risk for severe COVID-19 infection [15].
ACE2 receptor upregulation results in increased binding sites for SARS-CoV-2, leading to a
higher risk for COVID-19 infection. Ferrario et al. showed that Lisinopril and losartan caused a 5
and 3-fold increase in ACE2 levels, respectively [16].
Li et al. hypothesized that ACEI could stimulate a negative feedback [4], while Sun et al. argued
that their use could lead to a decreased chance of SARS-CoV-2 entering the cell [17].
The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) states that
“there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes with
background use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.” This statement recommends continuing these drugs
if they are being prescribed for valid indications and advises clinicians not to add or remove
them

Given the common use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs worldwide and reviewing the literature
along with our study, we provide tentative reassurance that at least ACEI and ARBs are safe in
patients with COVID-19. Whether they are actually beneficial should be studied in clinical trials.
There is an urgent need for available and safe drugs to treat COVID-19, however, we must take
caution in their prescription since they may exacerbate this disease. We recommend guidelinedirected administration and continuation of these drugs, and we emphasize that our primary role
as physicians is to do no harm.

Conclusions
Our Findings could be assumed to be suggestive for certain correlations between the
presentations and the course of COVID-19 infection, and the distinct drug groups used before
and during the course of the disease by the patients. However, our specific positive results were
not in accord with the findings of previously done studies. Moreover, we could not replicate the
positive findings, i.e. the specific correlations between medical conditions and drug usages, of
previous studies as it is discussed in details in the previous section. Therefore, it is reasonable to
conclude that further investigations are crucial to bring about the conclusive evidences with
regards to the effects of prior usage of aspirin, statins, metformin, ARBs, ACEIs, and
Clopidogrel on the outcome and various presentations of COVID-19.
