Abstract
Background
Mortality rates of UK patients hospitalised with COVID-19 appeared to fall during the first wave. We
quantify potential drivers of this change and identify groups of patients who remain at high risk of
dying in hospital.

Methods
The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) WHO
Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK recruited a prospective cohort admitted to 247 acute UK
hospitals with COVID-19 in the first wave (March to August 2020). Outcome was hospital mortality
within 28 days of admission. We performed a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using
natural effects models to explore associations between week of admission and hospital mortality
adjusting for confounders (demographics, comorbidity, illness severity) and quantifying potential
mediators (respiratory support and steroids).

Findings
Unadjusted hospital mortality fell from 32.3% (95%CI 31.8, 32.7) in March/April to 16.4% (95%CI
15.0, 17.8) in June/July 2020. Reductions were seen in all ages, ethnicities, both sexes, and in
comorbid and non-comorbid patients. After adjustment, there was a 19% reduction in the odds of
mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.79, 0.83). 15.2% of this reduction was explained by
greater disease severity and comorbidity earlier in the epidemic. The use of respiratory support
changed with greater use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 22.2% (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.94, 0.96) of the
reduction in mortality was mediated by changes in respiratory support.

Interpretation
The fall in hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients during the first wave in the UK was partly
accounted for by changes in case mix and illness severity. A significant reduction was associated with
differences in respiratory support and critical care use, which may partly reflect improved clinical
decision making. The remaining improvement in mortality is not explained by these factors, and may
relate to community behaviour on inoculum dose and hospital capacity strain.

Key points / Research in Context

Evidence before this study
Risk factors for mortality in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 have been established. However
there is little literature regarding how mortality is changing over time, and potential explanations for
why this might be. Understanding changes in mortality rates over time will help policy makers
identify evolving risk, strategies to manage this and broader decisions about public health
interventions.

Added value of this study
Mortality in hospitalised patients at the beginning of the first wave was extremely high. Patients who
were admitted to hospital in March and early April were significantly more unwell at presentation
than patients who were admitted in later months. Mortality fell in all ages, ethnic groups, both sexes
and in patients with and without comorbidity, over and above contributions from falling illness
severity. After adjustment for these variables, a fifth of the fall in mortality was explained by changes
in the use of respiratory support and steroid treatment, along with associated changes in clinical
decision-making relating to supportive interventions. However, mortality was persistently high in
patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation, and in those patients who received noninvasive ventilation outside of critical care.

Implications of all the available evidence
The observed reduction in hospital mortality was greater than expected based on the changes seen
in both case mix and illness severity. Some of this fall can be explained by changes in respiratory
care, including clinical learning. In addition, introduction of community policies including wearing of
masks, social distancing, shielding of vulnerable patients and the UK lockdown potentially resulted in
people being exposed to less virus.

The decrease in mortality varied depending on the level of respiratory support received. Patients
receiving invasive mechanical ventilation have persistently high mortality rates, albeit with a
changing case-mix, and further research should target this group.

Severe COVID-19 disease has primarily affected older people in the UK. Many of these people, but
not all have significant frailty. It is essential to ensure that patients and their families remain at the
centre of decision-making, and we continue with an individualised approach to their treatment and
care.

Introduction
There is growing evidence that mortality from COVID-19 is falling, both in hospital and in the

1-4

community.

One explanation may be that the case-mix of patients presenting to hospital has

changed towards a younger and less comorbid demographic, who were at lower risk of dying.
National UK lockdown and effective shielding measures of vulnerable at-risk populations may have
reduced transmission of the virus. Easier accessibility to testing as well as advice regarding seeking
medical help may have resulted in earlier presentation to hospital. Familiarity with the virus and
clinical course may have led to better management of patients through improved ward and ICU

We aimed to use the ISARIC CCP-UK cohort to describe how 28-day in-hospital mortality has changed
over time in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. We explored potential drivers for these changes by
assessing the patient characteristics, the severity of illness and the treatment they received during
their hospital admission.

Methods
Study design and setting
We undertook a prospective cohort study using participants in the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK cohort who
were admitted to acute general hospitals (n=247) in the first wave: 9 March to 2 August 2020.
National strategy changed from containment to admission based on clinical need on 12 March.

13

Participants and study size
Recruited patients were adults (≥18yrs) admitted to hospital with high likelihood or confirmed
COVID-19 from assumed community acquired infection (further details in online supplement). All
patients were admitted at least six weeks prior to data extraction to allow for sufficient 28 day
follow up. For the main analysis, we excluded patients without an outcome date (included as
“survivors” in online supplement sensitivity analysis).

Data collection
Data were extracted from routine healthcare records and recorded onto case report forms on a
REDCap database. Under the Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice 2020 for urgent public
health research, processing of demographic and routine clinical data from medical records for
research does not require consent in England and Wales.

Exposures
The main exposure of interest was the week of admission to hospital, defined using the ISO week
date (ordinal week of the year). To facilitate comparison across time periods, this was also
categorised into 3 equal time-periods (TP): TP1 = ISO weeks 11 to 17 (9 March to 26 April), TP2 = 18
to 24 (27 April to 14 June) and TP3 = 25 to 31 (15 June to 2 August).

Variables
We collected information on key variables including patient characteristics, illness severity, level of
respiratory support, COVID-19 specific treatments, and hospital mortality.

Patient characteristics: patient age (<50yrs, 50-69yrs, 70-79yrs, 80yrs+); sex (Female, Male); selfreported ethnicity (South Asian, East Asian, Black, Other Ethnic Minority and White)

16

, index of

multiple deprivations (derived from individual patient postal code), and health worker. Modified
Charlson comorbidities (see online supplement) were used to construct the comorbidity count (0, 1,
2+).

Severity of illness at admission (or within 24h) was assessed using physiological components of the
ISARIC 4C Mortality Score

12

: respiratory rate (RR, breaths/min), peripheral oxygen saturation on

room air (SpO2, %), Glasgow coma scale (GCS), urea (mmol/L) and C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L). To
capture the patterns in accessing hospital treatment we calculated the days from symptom onset to
admission.

Patients were categorised as managed on the ward or in critical care (see the online supplement for
more information on level of respiratory support). Maximum level of respiratory support was
categorised into: no respiratory support, oxygen (face mask/nasal cannulae/high flow nasal oxygen
(HFNO)), non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

COVID-19 specific treatments: we recorded only whether patients received corticosteroids
(dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and prednisolone), as these were the only
treatment with proven mortality benefit for COVID-19 in randomised controlled trials.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was the weekly in-hospital 28-day mortality, as a proportion of all patients
admitted in the observed week. Mortality was defined as an outcome of death or discharge to
palliative care. The 28-day threshold aligns with the Public Health England definition of a COVID-19

18

death.

Secondary outcomes were changes in patient demographics and illness severity for patients
managed on the ward and in critical care. Within critical care, we looked separately at oxygen only,
NIV, and IMV. Within ward care, we looked at those receiving no respiratory support, oxygen only
and NIV.

Statistical methods
Continuous data are presented as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range)
depending on the distribution. Categorical data are presented as frequency (%). For univariable
comparisons, we used Welch’s

t-test, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U, or Kruskal–Wallis tests according to

data distribution. Categorical data were compared using chi-squared tests. Counts and proportions
for each of the exposure variables were calculated across the three equal time-periods. The weekly
proportion of patients admitted and in-hospital 28-day mortality were stratified by each explanatory
variable of interest. 95% confidence intervals for these proportions were calculated using the exact
method.

There were missing data due to the challenges of real-time data collection during a pandemic.
Missing data are reported, and patterns of missing data were explored. Missing values for
comorbidities, healthcare worker status, and respiratory support (receiving oxygen, invasive and
non-invasive ventilation) were classified as ‘No’. For the primary analysis, multiple imputation using
chained equations was performed for missing markers of illness severity. Ten sets, each with 10
iterations, were imputed using 35 explanatory variables including outcomes. Graphical checks of
convergence were performed. All analyses were performed using imputed datasets.

Primary outcome: Our modelling strategy was informed by a putative causal model (Figure E1
proposed directed acyclic graph). Using logistic regression, we specified three models exploring the
association between admission week (as a continuous variable) and hospital mortality. A baseline
model included adjustment for age and sex. A second model accounted for known baseline
confounders including variables previously shown to be associated with in-hospital mortality: age,
sex, comorbidity count, index of multiple deprivation and severity of illness (RR, SpO2, GCS, urea,
CRP). In a third model, potential mediators were added to explore the effect of treatment (steroids
and respiratory support, including clinical decision making for the latter) on the association between
admission week and mortality (controlled direct effect models). We extended this in a potential
outcomes framework to perform a three-way decomposition mediation analysis using natural
effects models.

19

We sought to control confounding between, i) exposure and outcome, ii) exposure

and mediator, iii) mediator and outcome, iv) and we considered carefully potential
mediator:outcome confounders influenced by the exposure. Using standard frequentist approaches,
unobserved nested counterfactuals were imputed using an outcome model to accommodate our
nominal mediator (respiratory support). Exposure:mediator interactions were explored and a joint
model used to incorporate steroid use. Robust standard errors (based on sandwich estimator) were
generated, and results presented as a proportion mediated on the risk difference scale.

Secondary outcome: To better understand patterns of mortality for different levels of respiratory
support, time series data were modelled using Bayesian generalised additive models (GAMs) to
allow easy incorporation of multiply imputed datasets (see online supplement for more details).

All analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.3) and Stan using the packages tidyverse, finalfit,
brms, mgcv, mice, medflex, gridExtra and cowplot.

Results
Patient inclusion
The final cohort contained 63,972 patients (Table 1, Figure E2), from 247 acute hospitals in England,
Scotland and Wales, approximately 48% of all hospital admissions.

1

Admissions peaked in late March

and in early April for all age groups, and steadily decreased until the end of the study (Figure 1A).
29% (N=15,864) of patients managed on the ward died within 28 days of admission, compared with
36% (N=3,317) within critical care (Figure E2).

Patient demographics and severity of illness
The majority of patients admitted throughout the first wave were ≥50yrs (N=55,562 (87%)). There
was an increase in the proportion of younger people (<50yrs) admitted over time (TP1 13.2% vs TP3
17.5%) (Table 1, Figure 2A). There were initially more men admitted than women (60%:40%), but
proportions were similar from mid-April (Figure 2B). The population was multi-morbid, with over
50% of patients having two or more comorbidities and this increased over time (Figure 2C, Table E1).
Patients were mostly of White ethnicity with an increasing proportion of South Asian and a
decreasing proportion of Black ethnic groups (Figure 2D). The most deprived quintile was most
prevalent in all time periods and increased over time (Figure 2E).

Illness severity peaked around March 30 to April 12, when people at presentation to hospital had
faster respiratory rates, lower peripheral oxygen saturations, and higher rates of reduced conscious
level, acute kidney injury and inflammation, compared with patients admitted subsequently (Figure
3). Patients presented later in their disease process at the beginning compared with the end of the
first wave (TP1 med 4 days (IQR 7), TP2 med 2 (IQR 7), TP3 med 3 (IQR 7)) (Table 1).

Respiratory support and critical care admission
At the peak of admissions, over 80% of patients admitted to hospital received supplementary
oxygen. This reduced consistently over subsequent weeks to around 50% for patients admitted in
July onwards (Figure E3).

Most patients were managed on the ward, with the proportion of patients being admitted to critical
care peaking at the start of the study (N=7,732 (16.3%)) (Table 1, Figure E4). Patients admitted to
critical care were younger, and were more likely to be male (Critical care male N=6,433 (68.9%) vs
ward male N=29,690 (54.3%)) (Tables E2, E3). Patients with multi-morbidity accounted for a
significant proportion of patients (Critical care comorbid N= 3,733 (40%) vs ward comorbid N=
32,531 (60%)) (Tables E2, E3). The pattern of increasing proportions over time of younger and more
comorbid patients in critical care mirrored that seen on the ward (Tables E2, E3).

Level of respiratory support received reduced over time for both critical care and ward patients
(Figure 4). As the requirement for IMV fell (TP1 64%, TP3 29%, Table E2), the proportion of those
requiring NIV substantially increased from 23% to 47% (Table E2). In comparison, on the ward, NIV
proportions remained very low decreasing from 9% to 5% (Table E3). By the end of the first wave,
42.7% of all patients admitted received no respiratory support (ward patients 48.5%) (Table 1, Table
E3, Figure 4). More information on patient characteristics within Critical care and the ward and
respiratory support groups are in the online supplement (Tables E4-E9).

Steroid use
The proportion of patients who received steroids increased from 12% (22% in critical care) at the
start of the pandemic to 31% (65% in critical care) in June and July (Tables 1 and E2, Figure E5 & E6),
mainly in the groups receiving respiratory support.

Hospital mortality
In-hospital mortality in patients admitted in March and early April fell from 32% to 16% for patients
admitted in June and July. (Figure 1B, Table E10). This did not substantially differ in the sensitivity
analysis including those without an outcome reclassified as ‘survivors’ (Figure E7).

Hospital mortality was higher with increasing age, increasing comorbidity count, and male sex, and
fell for all demographic categories, most notably in the older (80+ yrs TP1 mortality 48.0% vs TP3
25.0%) and comorbid populations (Figure 2, Table E10). Markers of increased severity of illness at
presentation to hospital were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Mortality fell for all
markers of severity of illness over time (Figure 3) and for patients treated in both ward and ICU
environments (Figure E4).

There was a 22% reduction in odds of mortality per 4 week period (OR 0.78, 95%CI 0.77 to 0.80,
Figure 6). After adjustment for age and sex, this was OR 0.74 (95% CI 0.72, 0.75). After additional
adjustment for severity and comorbidity, the effect of week of admission on hospital mortality was
similar (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.78). With addition of the mediator variables (respiratory
support/steroids), the OR reduced to 0.81 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.83). 22.2% (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.96)
of the effect of week of admission on hospital mortality was mediated through respiratory care and
steroids. There was a significant interaction between respiratory support and week of admission
(p<0.001).

There were significant reductions in unadjusted mortality between TP1 and TP3 in patients receiving
no respiratory support (TP1 14.4% vs TP3 6.0%), oxygen only (Ward: 35.1% vs 21.3%; Critical Care
22.6% vs 12.8%), and NIV in ICU (33.3% vs 24.8%) across all age groups (Figure 4, Table E10).
However, mortality remained persistently high for patients receiving IMV (41.1% vs 41.8%) and NIV
on the ward (48.0% vs 44.3%). These differential changes in mortality persisted after adjustment for
demographic and severity of illness variables (Figure 5).

Discussion
Overall hospital mortality within 28 days after admission substantially decreased throughout the
course of the first wave. At the peak of admissions in late March and early April, illness severity at
hospital presentation was greatest, and patients presented later from their onset of symptoms.
There was a reduction in the level of respiratory support received: use of invasive ventilation
reduced over time, and the proportion of non-invasive ventilation increased. By late June/July,
nearly half of patients admitted required no supplementary oxygen. The reduction in hospital
mortality was seen across all demographic groups, and was not fully accounted for by the fall in case
mix or illness severity. One fifth of the reduction in mortality could be accounted for by changes in
treatment including respiratory care and steroids.

ISARIC4C has recruited patients across the UK, accounting for approximately two-thirds of patients
admitted to hospital in the UK with COVID-19 in the first wave. Data were collected from the front
door to discharge for patients managed both on the ward and within critical care enabling us to
review admissions and mortality for the whole hospital. We did not record treatment escalation
plans, but we were able to examine changing case-mixes in the ward and critical care. Due to the
nature of the pandemic, there were more missing data than would normally be expected in a
prospective cohort study, but this was handled using appropriate methods. We were unable to
comment on community factors leading up to admission, and indeed those who were not admitted
to hospital. This was an observational study, as such we were unable to assign causality and
unmeasured confounding may remain. The issue of conditioning on a collider for critical care cohort
is well established in critical care epidemiology literature and its impact on associations is
understood. This comparison of ward vs critical care cohorts is absent from most other literature.

We have demonstrated a reduction in hospital mortality that cannot be fully explained by baseline
demographics or measured presenting severity of illness markers. This is consistent with experiences
in New York hospitals

20

where mortality also significantly and progressively fell over the course of

the study period. Critical care mortality in the UK has also reduced.

The majority of patients

admitted to hospital throughout the first wave were elderly, comorbid and of White ethnicity, and
these groups had the highest mortality. Case mix changed over the pandemic, with a rise in the
proportion of younger and female patients who, both in our study and others, have lower mortality

23,24

rates.

However the falls in mortality were seen in all ages, ethnic groups, and in both sexes.

Shielding of vulnerable groups was formally introduced on 23 March

25

and earlier patients may have

been more vulnerable but not identifiable in our dataset. Severity of illness at presentation to
hospital fell and increasingly patients required no respiratory support at all. SARS-CoV-2 infection is
transmitted predominantly by respiratory droplets, so social distancing, UK lockdown (March 23

26

2020)

, and widespread adoption of masks may have reduced viral load (infectious dose) at point of

27

transmission

, in turn reducing severity of illness in infected patients.

28

Patients presented earlier in

their disease course in later months and length of stay for non-survivors in critical care increased
consistent with patients presenting earlier in their illness, and less in-extremis. Our data do not
include community factors, however it may be that changes in health seeking behaviour enabled
patients to attend hospitals more easily.

Hospital admissions in the UK peaked at approximately 3,000 patients admitted to hospital each day
in early April, with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) caseload peaking shortly after,
plateau of approximately 100 patients per day by July.

The UK has a small health care workforce,

with relatively few hospital and critical care beds in comparison to other high income countries.

Coming into the pandemic, the UK had high levels of bed occupancy and very little spare capacity.

However, during the rapid response to COVID-19 there was a substantial increase in capacity and

national reported occupancy for critical care never exceeded 60%, although local peaks were much

20

higher.

Even during more normal times, critical care capacity strain is associated with increased

31

mortality.

The rapid expansion of critical care beds required redeployment of non-critical care staff,

and in some UK regions, increased ratios of nursing staff to patients which may have impacted on
early patient outcomes.

32

During the peak of admissions, and during peak illness severity, a higher proportion of patients were
admitted to critical care. Patients in critical care at this time were considerably younger than ward

5

patients, even so, mortality was much higher than for other SARIs such as viral pneumonia.

During

the peak admission period, the proportion of patients aged >80 years and those with multimorbidity
admitted to critical care was lower than subsequently, however, this reflected the demographic
pattern also seen in patients admitted to the ward at this time.

A fifth of the fall in mortality can be explained by changes in respiratory support and steroids along
with associated changes in clinical decision-making relating to the former intervention. The
proportion of patients receiving invasive ventilation reduced over time, however mortality remained
persistently high after adjusting for demographics and illness severity. It would be unwise to
interpret this association as causal as use of IMV is reserved for those with the most severe illness
and, overall, mortality reduced for patients admitted to critical care. There are several potential
explanations for this finding. Firstly, the change in case mix may not have been adequately captured
by multi-morbidity and age: a higher proportion of more elderly and comorbid patients were
ventilated later in the pandemic, potentially when there was more critical care capacity. Secondly,
practice within critical care changed, with increasing use of NIV over time, and only those presenting
in extremis or failing a trial of NIV received IMV. This may be partly due to the changing case mix, but
also due to increasing clinician familiarity with the use of NIV, and an improving ability to identify
which patients might benefit. Potentially, early patients who received IMV would later have received
NIV and have survived regardless of the mode of ventilation. The later patients receiving IMV were
therefore a more severely ill population who had failed to respond to treatments, and would die if
not offered IMV. This is supported by the significant increase in the effect of respiratory care over
time: allocation to respiratory support was linked to better prediction of outcome by clinicians over
time. Ongoing trials comparing the use of NIV and IMV in critically ill patients with COVID-19 will be
able to overcome this selection bias and confounding by indication to answer whether patient
selection or NIV itself is improving outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

33

Patients receiving NIV on the ward had higher mortality rates than patients on oxygen and NIV
managed in critical care. Along with the higher rates of comorbidity, in particular dementia and
chronic pulmonary and cardiac disease, this may reflect that the benefit of these treatments is
limited in this group of patients, as well as a potential ceiling of treatment for patients receiving NIV
on the ward. Mortality was extremely high in elderly patients who received invasive ventilation. The
benefit of ICU admission for elderly frail patients remains uncertain as this is a population with high

34

rates of mortality and long-term functional impairment in survivors.

Critical care interventions may

not be associated with improved outcomes in this group: in a previous study, protocolised ICU
referral in the elderly led to significantly higher ICU admission rates, but without a significant effect
on mortality, functional status or health-related quality of life.

35

It is essential that meaningful

discussions about the treatment options available as well as their risks and benefits are discussed
with these patients and their families.

36

Such discussions should also emphasise that much of the

potential benefit of care can be derived without the need for ICU level care.

Practice outside critical care has also changed, with increasing clinical familiarity with COVID-19.
Clinicians may have become more alert to deterioration, which can occur rapidly in COVID-19 and

substantially benefits subgroups of the hospital population, and trials of other treatments including
anticoagulation, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral agents, convalescent plasma and non-invasive
ventilation are ongoing.

This highlights the critical importance of suitably-powered randomised

controlled trials for drug evaluation even in outbreak situations.

Conclusion
In-hospital mortality rates for patients with COVID-19 fell in the UK over the course of the first wave.
This fall persisted after adjusting for illness severity and changes in patient case-mix. Patients were
most severely unwell at hospital presentation at the start of the pandemic and presented later in
their disease course. A significant proportion of the fall may be explained by changes in management
including respiratory support and steroid treatment. Hospital practice has changed, in particular the
use of NIV increased dramatically, and many patients have been included in drug and other
treatment trials, which may help to explain the fall in mortality and inform future waves. Hospital
mortality remained high for patients receiving invasive ventilation and ward non-invasive ventilation,
and these populations should be a priority in ongoing research.

Figure 5: Mortality in adults admitted to hospital with COVID-19 stratified by respiratory support and
age. Bayesian generalised additive model, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidity, GCS, respiratory rate,
SpO2, serum urea and CRP, with 3-way interaction between age, week of admission, and level of
respiratory support. Missing data imputed with 10 datasets. Plot lines represent samples from
posterior distribution.
