Abstract
Epidemiological models used to inform government policies aimed to contain the contagion of
COVID-19, assume that the reproduction rate is reduced through Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) leading to physical distancing. Available data in the UK show an increase in physical distancing before the NPIs were implemented and a fall soon after implementation. We
aimed to estimate the effect of people’s behaviour on the epidemic curve and the effect of NPIs
taking into account this behavioural component. We have estimated the effects of confirmed
daily cases on physical distancing and we used this insight to design a bevavioural SEIR model
(BeSEIR), simulated different scenaria regarding NPIs and compared the results to the standard
SEIR. Taking into account behavioural insights improves the description of the contagion dynamics of the epidemic significantly. The BeSEIR predictions regarding the number of infections
without NPIs were several orders of magnitude less than the SEIR. However, the BeSEIR prediction showed that early measures would still have an important influence in the reduction of
infections. The BeSEIR model shows that even with no intervention the percentage of the cumulative infections within a year will not be enough for the epidemic to resolve due to a herd immunity effect. On the other hand, a standard SEIR model significantly overestimates the effectiveness of measures. Without taking into account the behavioural component the epidemic is predicted to be resolved much sooner than when taking it into account.

Introduction

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus
responsible for COVID-19 has led to more than 9,277,214 confirmed cases and more than
478,691 deaths as of 25/06/020 [1]. Apart from the health-related implications, COVID-19 has
been affecting almost every aspect of people’s lives and these effects have been unequally
distributed. [2]

Given the current absence of a vaccine, governments have resorted to health policies known as
Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs), which are aimed to reduce the average number of
contacts between individuals (physical distancing). A number of studies have explored the
effects of NPIs on the contagion dynamics of COVID-19. [3–6] One of the key focuses of
compartmental epidemiological models used is the estimation of the effects of NPIs on the rate
of spread of the epidemic, which is captured by the basic reproduction number initially and the
effective one later. Hence, the effectiveness of the different policies depends on how the various
announced measures reduce this parameter. In order to be able to capture the level of this
effect, it is necessary to estimate the value of the effective reproduction number, which in
standard compartmental models is assumed to be initially constant and to change as a
response to NPIs. [7]

However, data which capture mobility levels of individuals show that in a number of countries,
including the UK, people reduced the number of visits and duration of stays (which are related
to physical distancing practices) before the NPIs are made and in excess of these measures.
This behaviour, fits well with a number of epidemiological models, which take into account
behavioural changes over and above NPIs [8–10] hence the effective reproduction becomes (at

least partly) endogenous. However, these works are theoretical and have not been applied to
data sets related to COVID-19 so far.

The purpose of our study was threefold: (i) assess the influence of NPIs on physical distancing
in the UK, taking into account individual behaviour due to observed cases; (ii) extend the
standard SEIR model in order to incorporate individual behaviour using the analysis from (i);
and (iii) use this extended model to study the effectiveness of the NPIs, including the level and
timing of measures taken and the possible effects of lifting the measures.

Methods

Data and Statistical Analysis

In order to assess the influence of both NPIs and the observed information, we analysed the
correlation between individuals’ mobility levels and the number of daily confirmed cases of the
previous day as reported in the WHO dashboard implemented by John Hopkins University, [1]
for three different periods: (a) up to the point when advice for physical distancing and avoidance
of unnecessary interactions and travel was given (b) between this advice and enforceable
lockdown, and (c) after lockdown. Enforceable lockdown includes NPIs ranging from the closure
of public spaces, transportation hubs and shops to forbidding interactions with people outside
one’s household and ban any unnecessary travel.

Following Buckee et al. (2020), [11] we created an aggregated data time series for physical

distancing in the UK using data from Google’s “COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports”, which
shows the changes in mobility in six different categories:
1. Retail and recreation, reporting the mobility trends for places such as restaurants, cafés,
shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries and cinemas.
2. Supermarket and pharmacy, capturing the trends for places such as supermarkets, food
warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops and pharmacies
3. Parks, which shows the mobility trends for places like national parks, public beaches,
marinas, dog parks, plazas and public gardens.
4. Public transport, which shows the mobility trends for places that are public transport
hubs, such as underground, bus and train stations.
5. Workplaces, capturing mobility trends to places of work
6. Residential, which shows mobility trends for places of residence.

We noted that not all of the above categories are relevant for measuring levels of physical
distancing, which on one hand are related to both NPIs and to individuals’ behaviour, while on
the other are relevant for the contagion dynamics. For this reason, we used the categories
“Workplaces”, “Public transport”, “Retail and recreation”. We defined as mobility

time , a weighted average of these three mobility categories. In order to calculate the different
weights, we first matched these categories with the relevant ones from the national travel
survey, 2018 [12] which includes the following travel categories: Business, Education, Escort
education, Shopping, Personal Business, Visiting friends at private home, Visiting friends
elsewhere, Entertainment / public activity, Sport, Holiday, Day trip, Other.

We matched the National Travel Survey categories “Holiday”, “Day trip”, “Entertainment / public
activity”, “Shopping”, “Visiting friends elsewhere (than home)” to the “Retail and Recreation”
mobility trend; “Commuting”, “Business” and “Personal Business” to the “Workplaces” mobility

trend. Additionally, we hypothesised that the “Public Transport / Transit” mobility trend uniformly
influences both the above trends. We then computed the relative weights of the above activities
with regards to the total activities and mapped these weights to the three mobility categories.
This gave us relative weights of 0.38 for “Retail and Recreation”, 0.29 for “Workplaces” and 0.33
for “Public Transport/Transit”.

We observe that mobility over time resembles a logistic distribution and the same is true for new



confirmed cases ( ௧ ), figure 1.

We observed two periods, one with a sharp decrease in mobility and one with a slight increase.
The plots of the confirmed cases follow a very similar pattern but in opposite directions. The
different measures taken seem to have an effect of the slope of both lines. The fall in confirmed
cases happens around 14 days after the measures have been taken and a big fall in mobility
has taken place.

Based on this observation, it is reasonable to assume that there is a linear relationship between
the two data series and that the available information in one period affects the decision for the
next, which means that

other influences including the

effects of NPIs.

However, given that also NPIs affect mobility, we tested this hypothesis for three different
periods: before advice, between advice and lockdown, and after lockdown. This hypothesis is
supported by very high and significant correlation between the two variables in all three different
periods (Supplementary Figure 1).

This observation highlights the fact that measures are not the only factors which influence
mobility which in turn is related to physical distancing levels and the reproduction number of
COVID-19. Behaviour should therefore be taken into account in relevant models and policy
simulations.

Behavioural SEIR Model

The key variable informing NPIs is the reproduction rate, which is the fraction of the





transmission rate of the epidemic ( ௧ ) over the recovery rate of infected individuals ( ). The daily
transmission rate (and hence the basic or effective reproduction rate) directly depends on the
number contacts per individual, which means that due to the assumption that mobility is a proxy
of daily number of contacts we can express

Susceptible subjects might get infected when they contact an infectious individual and if
infected, they enter the exposed compartment before the infected one. Following Prem et al.

Equations (2)-(8) constitute the baseline Behavioural SEIR based on UK data. The last equation
captures the behavioural part of the compartmental model based in the UK and may differ for
other countries or other epidemics as the linear relationship which we observed may not hold in
other jurisdictions or countries.

Results

We simulated the contagion dynamics in the UK and the different effects of policies over two
periods of 200 and 300 days, respectively, with the demographic changes being ignored, hence
keeping the total number of individuals as constant. For equations (3)-(7), we used values from
relevant published works. We used the data from a counterfactual SEIR model with

Using these values, our extended behavioural SEIR model was able to reproduce the dynamics
of contagion in the UK (Figure 2 A, B).

We compared the simulation results of our model with a standard SEIR (without the behavioural
component) and found that the latter model predicts a number of infections both cumulative
(figure 2 C) and per day, much higher than the behavioural one (figure 2 D,E). The difference
regarding infections is several orders of magnitude, which highlights the importance of taking
into account behavioural factors.

We compared the effectiveness of NPIs in our model and in the standard SEIR. As expected in
the standard SEIR the cumulative number of infected individuals is lower than in the behavioural
one (figure 3 A). As in the previous case, the cumulative number differs by several orders of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.20248308; this version posted December 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this

magnitude. We not that reproduction rate on the standard SEIR is only affected by NPIs (figure
3 B). Interestingly, we noticed that the maximum number of infected individuals at any point in
time using the behavioural SEIR model is significantly and much more realistically lower than
the standard SEIR (figure 4 C, D), where it also takes longer for the number of infected to be
reduced.

We tested the impact on the total number of infected individuals and the maximum confirmed
daily cases of the delay of (i) implementing the measures (ii) and lifting restrictions. This allowed
us to compute the cost in terms of lockdown days in order to reach the same reproduction
number. The next graph shows the dynamics of key variables compared to a hypothetical
situation when the same measures had been taken 7 days earlier than the actual date of
intervention.

We noticed that, while the timing of measures has an important impact on the number of
infected individuals (both daily and cumulatively, figure 4 A, B, C), the reproduction rate is
reduced relatively less compared to the scenario where the measures are taken later (figure 4
D). This highlights that all other factors being equal, it may be optimal to have a relatively higher
reproduction rate with a lower number of infected rather than the opposite. This is due to the
fact that the number of infected individuals at any point in time depends both in the reproduction
rate and the number of infected in the previous period. Hence a later intervention would require
a higher reduction in the reproduction number to have the same reduction in infections to an
earlier one.

We tested the impact of lifting the measures earlier rather than later and also compared this to
the hypothetical case of earlier timing of NPIs. As expected, the most efficient policy would be to
both delay lifting physical distancing measures and implementing NPIs early (figure 5). We

noticed that taking the timing regarding on when the measures are lifted plays a less important
role (assuming that there will be a lift) compared to the timing of imposing the measures.

Discussion
The absence of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has led most countries to result in NPIs in order to
reduce the contagion of COVID-19 and a fast-growing literature has been focusing on
estimating the effectiveness of these interventions. We argued that in order to be able to
evaluate the interventions, it is necessary to explicitly take account of the behavioural change
with regards to physical distancing due to both the relevant NPIs and independent individual
choices. If individual behaviour is not taken into account, the levels of physical distancing
without measures can be underestimated and similarly the effectiveness of measures can be
overestimated. Hence, incorporating an autonomous element of physical distancing can also
increase the accuracy of modelling predictions.

Using aggregate mobility data for the UK, we observed that individual mobility levels had been
reducing before the measures were taken and have been increasing even before the
announcement of relaxation of the measures. We tested whether information regarding
confirmed cases can explain the changes in mobility within the different periods of NPIs. In
order to also take into consideration, the effects of policies, we considered three distinct periods:
before advice, between advice and lockdown, and after lockdown. We found high correlation in
all three periods, which confirms the fact that people have been making physical distancing
choices using the available information regarding the number of cases which are also assumed
to be correlated to the number of deaths. We note that the number of cases reported, at the
early phases of the epidemic at least, was a gross underestimate of the real cases. However,

the number of deaths has been used in order to infer the number of cases by imposing a
somewhat arbitrary death rate. Given this as long as the number of deaths is a fraction of the
number of cases the outcome of our behavioural SEIR model will not change and in addition we
acknowledge that people make decisions based on imperfect information.

This observation raised two policy related questions with regards to the timing of making the
interventions and the time of lifting these. Given that individuals react autonomously, policies
are less effective compared to a situation where individuals do not act independently. However,
it is not clear how much this behaviour would impact the overall results.

Other studies have taken into account the structured nature of human relationships and the
different transmission rates that can be realized in different places, for example care homes or
hospitals can show higher transmission rates than households. We acknowledge that our model
provides a higher level of abstraction that doesn’t take this into account.

Conclusion
In order to be able to assess the effects of the different policies, we first extended the standard
SEIR model to a behavioural SEIR. This model incorporates the insights stemming from the
previous observations; hence it takes into account the fact that mobility is not only determined
by NPIs, but also from the observed information with regards to confirmed daily cases. This
incorporates a feedback effect between confirmed cases and average number of contacts
between individuals, which means that the reproduction rate is (partly) endogenous.

We calibrated the behavioural SEIR model using epidemiological data from previous relevant

studies, values for the reproduction number based in the UK, and UK mobility data. We started
our simulations with a seed of 1000 people exposed on Day 0. Genetic analysis has showed
1356 transmission lineages of COVID-19 in the UK. [15] We ran simulations that provided a
number of insights which are relevant for policy. When the level of daily infections is relatively
low, more strict measures are required in order to achieve high levels of physical distancing.
This means that the same level of measures may be less effective in reducing the reproduction
rate if these are imposed earlier rather than later. However, this does not mean that early
measures are less effective in reducing the overall number of infections as NPIs which are
imposed even a week earlier can have an important impact in the reduction of infections.

This finding may give an explanation about the initial spread of the epidemic in countries that
were hit first. Given the high uncertainty and the much lower volumes of information the
endogenous behavioural component we describe couldn’t have a significant effect in these
countries. On the other hand, quickly introduced NPIs in the form of enforceable lockdowns
were the only way to reduce the spread of the epidemic.

Our results highlight two issues. First, not taking into account the fact that individuals also react
themselves over and above NPIs may lead to very misleading projections with regards to the
effectiveness of measures. Second, the fact that even though the reproduction number is a
relevant variable for policy purposes, it is not necessarily a measure of success of NPIs. A
higher reproduction number with less active cases can be preferable to the opposite can be less
challenging to the capacity of a given health system. Of course, the basic reproductive rate of
the disease as defined by the biological features of the sars-cov-2 virus is still important as it is
predictive of the epidemic curve in the absence of NPIs or changes in human behaviour.

Supplementary Material

Supplemental Figure 1
Supplemental Figure 1:
Plots of the logit transformation (ratio of proportions) of the percentage drop of mobility from
baseline against new cases per day. Plots show the relationship between mobility and new
cases for three periods. A: Before measures, B: After implementing the Non-Pharmaceutical
Interventions and C: After the peak of the epidemic. In all cases we have strong significant
correlations between drop in mobility and new cases per day. The correlation is stronger after
the measures and up to peak of the epidemic.
