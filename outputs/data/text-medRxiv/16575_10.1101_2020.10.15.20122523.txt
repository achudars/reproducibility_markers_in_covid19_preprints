Background: There is an ongoing critical need to improve therapeutic strategies for COVID-19
pneumonia, particularly in the most severely affected patients. Adult mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) infusions have the potential to benefit critically ill patients with acute respiratory syndrome
SARS-COV-2 infection, but clinical data supporting efficacy are lacking.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
To evaluate clinical
responsiveness in the most critically ill patient we examined outcomes in a sub-group of those
requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. Patients (n=9) were
administered with up to 3 infusions of intravenous (IV) MSCs and compared to a local ECMO
control group (n=31). The primary outcome was safety, and the secondary outcomes were allcause mortality (or rate of hospital discharge), cytokine levels, and viral clearance.
Findings: MSC infusions (12 patients) were well tolerated and no side effects occurred. Of
ECMO patients receiving MSC infusions, 2 out of 9 died (22.2%; 95%CI: 2.8%, 60.0%) compared
with a mortality of 15 of 31 (48.4%; 95%CI: 30.2%, 66.9%; p = 0.25) in the ECMO control group.
Isolated plasma exosomes containing the SARS-COV-2 Spike protein decreased after MSC
infusions between day 14 or 21 after administration (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively) and was
associated with a decrease in COVID-19 IgG Spike protein titer at same time points (p = 0.006
and p=0.007, respectively). Control ECMO patients receiving convalescent plasma did not clear
COVID-19 IgG over the same time frame.
Interpretation: Together these findings suggest that MSC IV infusion is well tolerated in patients
with a broad range of severity including the most severe COVID-19 ARDS requiring ECMO.
These data also raise the possibility that MSCs, in addition to exerting an immunomodulatory
effect, contribute to viral clearance and strongly support the conduct of randomized placebocontrolled trial.

Introduction:
The emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) has led
to an unprecedented global pandemic (1). As of September 11, 2020, COVID-19 has resulted in
over 28.5 million cases and ~900,000 deaths worldwide, and at least 6.4 million cases and
~190,000 deaths in the United States. The mortality largely results from the development of a
severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing
multisystem organ failure (2).

severe fatal hypoxemia, and

The virus affects the respiratory system by binding to the

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which is constitutively expressed in alveolar
cells and vascular endothelium(3). Infected patients have a nearly universal development of a
severe proinflammatory state, reflected by elevated levels of C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin-6,
ferritin, and other cytokines (4-6) (7). Traditional interventions for inflammatory syndromes have
had limited efficacy, and there are no therapeutic agents which prevent or treat ARDS in COVID19 patients, although remdesivir has now entered clinical practice based on studies showing
reduced hospitalization days (2, 8, 9). Recently, a Wuhan study reported that out of 201
hospitalized patients, 42% developed ARDS which resulted in a 52% hospital mortality (10). A
recent pooled analysis reported as high as 71% mortality in COVID-19 ARDS patients, and a
reported 94% mortality in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) COVID-19 patients
(11). To reduce mortality in the most severe COVID-19 ARDS patients, mitigating the cytokine
storm represents a key strategy. However, many anti-inflammatory drugs have serious sideeffects including the potential to offset immune mechanisms aimed at decreasing the viral load.
Accordingly, an immunomodulatory therapy, such as the MSC, which also possesses anti-viral
properties would be highly valuable in the anti-covid19 armamentarium.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess unique and powerful immunomodulatory
characteristics and effectively block cytokine release syndrome in laboratory models(12-14).
Recently in China, intravenous adult MSCs have been reported to improve 7 COVID-19 patients

with mostly mild symptoms by significantly dampening the cytokine storm and improving
pulmonary function and symptoms, without any reported side effects (15). To this point, however,
the efficacy of MSC infusion in the most severely ill patients has not been tested, especially in
patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Here, we report on an initial experience of patients receiving IV MSC infusions, a subset
of whom required ECMO support. Taking advantage of the availability of a local patients with
COVID-19 receiving ECMO support (16), we performed a case-control analysis of a cohort of
COVID-19 patients receiving intravenous infusions of MSCs following ECMO implantation. Our
results extend earlier reports from very sick COVID-19 patients, that MSCs may have salutary
effects and are safe.

Methods
Study design and patients
This case-control evaluation was part of an overall approach of cell-based therapy at the
University of Maryland School of Medicine, Wake Forest University, and University of Miami
Health System to treat COVID-19 patients, conducted from April 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020.
All patients were confirmed by the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assay of nasal-pharyngeal swabs for COVID-19. All patients met the inclusion criteria: 1)
moderate to severe categories of the Berlin ARDS criteria with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg; 2) >18
years of age; exclusion criteria included: 1) nursing mothers; 2) positive bacteria blood cultures;
3) liver transaminases tests >5 normal values. Criteria for clinical improvement was determined
by weaning off-ECMO support, weaning from mechanical ventilation, or discharge from the
hospital. We used single patient emergency-access FDA approval, local Institute Review Board
(IRB) approval, and a legal authorized representative for intubated patients provided informed
consent.

Contemporaneous group
Since the MSCs were administered based on compassionate use, there was no
randomization. However, we established a control group for comparison of outcomes and clinical
characteristics between the MSC-administered subjects and other critically ill ARDS ECMO
patients hospitalized at our local institution with similar baseline characteristics. For our institution,
we retrospectively characterized all ECMO COVID-19 patients admitted during the same time
period from April 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020.

MSC production
Allogeneic MSCs were derived from healthy bone-marrow donors and the samples were
>70% viable at the time of intravenous injection. Patients on ECMO received infusion of allogeneic
MSCs via the ECMO circuit return cannula (positioned in the right atrium, with the majority of
blood directed across the tricuspid valve and into the pulmonary circulation) and non-ECMO
patients received the MSCs intravenously through a central venous catheter. Standard of care
infusion was provided for all ARDS patients on or off ECMO.

Clinical Information
Clinical information for the 12 patients before and after MSC infusion and non-MSC
administered control group admitted at the same time was obtained from a review of the hospital
electronic medical system and include the following: demographic data, days of admission from
symptom onset, and presenting symptoms; data about various infusions, including mechanical
ventilation, ECMO support, antiviral therapies, medications, and steroids; clinical data, including
PAO2/FiO2, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (range 0-24, with higher scores
indicating more severe illness), laboratory data, including blood cultures, white blood cell count,
chemistry panels assessing liver and kidney function, viral PCR load, inflammatory factors Creactive protein (CRP; mg/dL), IL-6 (pg/mL), ferritin (ng/mL) and procalcitonin (ng/mL); data from

chest imaging studies; and information on complications, such as ARDS, ECMO, MSC infusion
reactions, ventilation, bacterial pneumonia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Since the
ECMO blood flow remained constant during support, the oxygen delivery provided by the ECMO
circuit remained constant for these patients. Therefore, increasing PAO2/FiO2 ratios or the need
to reduce sweep gas flow for these patients is related to improvement in their native lung function.

Biomarker Analysis

concentrations(pg/mL) were measured using commercial assay (Meso Scale Discovery,
Gaithersburg, MD). To study the imprecision and variability of the biomarker measurements, intraand inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were determined. Intra-assay CVs tested the
variability of biomarker measurements performed in the same sample on the same assay plate.
Inter-assay CVs tested the variability of biomarker measurements performed in the same sample
on different assay plates often used to measure long-term imprecision. When measuring
biomarkers with multiplex assays, generally CV’s <15% are targeted and CVs <5% are
considered excellent. For the preliminary analysis, all intra-assay CVs were less than 10% and
inter-assay CVs for these biomarkers were <10%.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen containing exosomes:
Sera collected from severe COVID-19 patients following MSC IV administration infusion
were utilized to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen containing exosomes by
immunoblot. Exosomes were isolated using ultracentrifugation and the presence of exosomes
specific marker CD9 was validated using immunoblot as previously published (17-19). Briefly,
Total exosome protein (30 μg) was resolved in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the
proteins were transferred into a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The PVDF

membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk prepared in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
was probed with exosome-specific marker CD9 (312102, BioLegend) and SARS-CoV-2 spike
(GTX632604, GeneTex) were used as primary antibodies and goat-anti-mouse conjugated with
horse radish peroxidase (7076, Cell Signaling Technology) were used as secondary antibody.
The blots were washed with 1x PBS-Tween (Thermo Fisher Scientific), developed using
chemiluminescent HRP substrate (WBKLS0500, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA), and exposed
using Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). The intensity of SARSCoV-2 spike antigen was quantified using ImageJ software and normalized with CD9.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA methodology
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured in the plasma of COVID 19 patients by
following the methodology of Stadlbauer and colleagues (20). 96-well microtiter ELISA plates
(Thermo Scientific; Waltham, MA) were pre-coated overnight at 4oC with 100 ng/well of the
truncated form of spike protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), dissolved in glycerol and washed
(x3) with PBS (Corning; Corning, NY) and 0.05% tween-20 (PBS-T). A 300 uL blocking solution
(PBS-T + 5% milk powder (SigmaAldrich, Saint Louis MO) was then added to each well and
incubated at room temperature for 1h and washed off before serial dilutions (1:100 to 1:51200) of
patients and control plasma samples were added and incubated at room temperature for 1h. The
wells were again washed, incubated with 100uL of Anti-Human IgG (Fab specific) HRP-labeled
secondary antibody (1:12000) in the dark at 20oC for 1h, washed with PBS-T, incubated with
100uL of TMB substrate for 10 minutes followed by 100uL of 1N Sulfuric Acid (SigmaAldrich,
Saint Louis MO) to stop the reaction. ELISA plates were then read at absorbance 450nm. Positive
signal cutoff was determined using the formula: OD = ((avg OD of negative controls) + 3(SD of
negative controls OD)). The negative controls consisted of plasma samples from patients
diagnosed with non-SARS-CoV-2.

Statistical Analysis
To assess temporal changes in cytokines associated with MSC infusions, we constructed
graphs anchoring at the baseline cytokine level (on the x-axis) which was defined as the sample
obtained immediately prior to the first MSC infusion. We plotted cytokine levels 3 days after the
first infusion, 3 or 4 days after the second MSC infusion, and 2 days after the third infusion on the
y-axis. These days were selected based on availability of data and represent reasonably similar
durations from MSC infusion to sample collection. All cytokines were plotted in the log scale. To
estimate the proportion of samples stable or decreasing after MSC infusions, we created a binary
response variable based on the post-MSC sample being less than or equal to the baseline
cytokine level and fit a repeated measures logistic model with an independent correlation
structure. For each cytokine, we present the proportion of samples less than or equal to baseline
levels with corresponding valid 95% confidence intervals. The null hypothesis of this single
sample test is that this proportion is equal to 50%. Significantly different estimates at the p= 0.05
level were shown by whether the 95% confidence intervals contained the null. To compare risk
of death (i.e., cumulative incidence) in the absence of censoring since all were known to have
either died or survived to discharge, we present the proportion who died with exact 95%
confidence intervals using the Klopper-Pearson method among those who supported with ECMO
for the 9 who received MSC infusions and the 31 who did not receive MSC infusions. Fisher's
exact test were used to compare survival among those who received MSC infusions to those who
did not locally, and then in comparison with the ELSO registry. All analyses were conducted in
SAS 9.4 software (Cary, NC) and graphs were constructed in R 4.0.0 (Vienna, Austria).

Results
From April 1,2020 to September 1, 2020, we administered MSCs under FDA eIND to
patients (n=12; age range, 39-72 years; 5 women) who met the inclusion criteria (Table1). All
MSC administered patients had pre-existing complex medical conditions and one was a former

smoker (Supplement Table 1,2). All had received hydroxychloroquine (100%), none had received
antivirals and most received corticosteroids (83.33%). Nine patients (75%) were supported with
venous-venous ECMO. MSC infusions were administered between 15 and 28 days after hospital
admission. During this period, 31 contemporaneous ECMO patients with COVID 19 and similar
baseline conditions (table 2) did not receive MSCs and served as a control group (Table 2).
No acute-infusion related or allergic reactions were observed within two hours after MSC infusion,
including hypotension, increased oxygenation, flushing, or temperature. No delayed
hypersensitivity or secondary infections were detected after infusion. Half of the patients received
two doses and the other half received three doses every 72 hrs.
Follow-up data for all outcomes were available through September 1, 2020. No patients
were lost to follow-up for the primary outcome of safety with MSC infusion which showed no
reported side effects. To assess whether MSC-therapy could have a clinical benefit, we compared
the mortality rate of infused patients to a relevant contemporaneous group. Of ECMO patients
who did not receive MSC infusion, 15 of 31 (48.4%; 95%CI: 30.2%, 66.9%; p=0.25) died
compared with a mortality rate of 2 of 9 patients receiving MSC infusion died (22.2%; 95%CI:
2.8%, 60.0%).
Six patients were successfully decannulated from ECMO on post-MSC infusion day 4, 15,
16, 18, 26, and 28 days, respectively, and of these, 2 patients required a tracheostomy and 5
patients were discharged home. The two tracheostomy patients had their tracheostomy
decannulated. One patient remained on ECMO at the end of the follow-up period, and two patients
died on ECMO after MSC infusion.
Two of 3 MSC administered patients not on ECMO were extubated and discharged from
the hospital with length of stay 34 and 67 days. A third MSC administered patient not on ECMO
suffered a myocardial infarction that resulted in a left ventricle ejection fraction of 10%,
cardiogenic shock and died on hospital day 29 which was 9 days after MSC infusion.

The SOFA score ranged from 4 to 19 prior to MSC infusion, and decreased to a range of
2 to 15 at 14 days following infusion (Supplement Table 1 and Figure 1). The PaO2/FiO2 ranged
from 78.33 to 371.43 prior to MSC infusion, and increased for most patients (83.33%), ranging
from 109 to 503.57 14 days after MSC infusion (Supplement Table 1 and Figure 1). After infusion,
inflammatory biomarkers concentrations for CRP, IL-6, ferritin, and procalcitonin decreased in all
patients (Supplement Table1 and Figure 2). Patient chest radiographs all demonstrated severe
bilateral dense pulmonary parenchymal opacities prior to MSC infusion and showed improvement
of the pulmonary opacities on the third day after MSC infusion and gradual resolution 10 days
after the first MSC dose (Supplement Figure 3). Even Patient 2 and Patient 4, who eventually
died, had resolving chest radiograph findings (Supplement Figure 3).

Inflammatory Cytokines
We next examined the levels of 11 pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines from
plasma samples taken at baseline and approximately three days after each MSC infusion by
examining their ratio of change from baseline and after each MSC infusion (Figure 2, Supplement
Figure4). These samples were grouped as 3 days after first infusion (black; n= 6), 3 or 4 days
after the second MSC infusion (blue, n= 5), and 2 days after the third infusion (red, n= 2). VEGFA in 25% of post-MSC infusion samples was less than or equal to baseline levels (95% CI: 11%,
48%) indicating that VEGF-A was increased in 75% of post-infusion. This was significantly
different from the null of 50% (p= 0.035). For the remaining cytokines, 61% to 77% of samples
decreased, apart from IL-8 in which 46% of the samples decreased. These were not significantly
different from the null, except for IL-12-p70 in which 77% were decreased (95% CI: 51%, 91%;
p= 0.043).

Immunoblot analysis showed that the COVID 19 spike protein antigens were present at
baseline in isolated plasma exosomes from COVID 19 patients prior to MSC infusion and
significantly reduced at post-infusion day 14 (p=0.007) in 5 patients or at day 21 (p=.006) in 3
patients. Of the three patients, specificity of the exosome assay was demonstrated in three
negative COVID 19 patients which revealed absence of spike protein in isolated plasma
exosomes. SARS-Co V-2 antibody levels measured in plasma samples drawn pre- and

post- MSC infusion in COVID 19 patients (Figure 4). SARS-CoV-2 antibody against a
truncated spike protein RBD was detected in all patients at time baseline prior to MSC
infusion and its titer was significantly decreased at day 14 post infusion, unchanged there
until day 21.

In comparison, ECMO patients receiving convalescent plasma did not

reveal similar reductions over the 14 to 21 day period (data not shown).

Discussion
In this case-control study, 12 critically ill COVID-19 patients were administered
intravenous infusions of culture-expanded allogeneic MSCs. In response, inflammatory cytokines
declined within days of MSC infusion, patients improved clinical status, SOFA scores, and
PaO2/FiO2 ratios, and exhibited resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs.
Among the sickest cohort requiring ECMO support, mortality was numerically less than that of the
global world-wide experienced as tabulated by the registry. Of 7 surviving ECMO patients, 6 have
been successfully decannulated with one subject remaining on ECMO at study endpoint. These
findings, which are preliminary, nevertheless add to other early stage reports, substantiate the
safety of these infusions, and strongly support efforts to rigorously test this strategy in placebocontrolled trials.
The novel SARS-CoV2 virus can induce ARDS as a serious manifestation of COVID-19
which can rapidly progress to refractory pulmonary failure. In the most advanced cases, ECMO

support may be considered as a rescue therapy, with limited prognosis for viral infections in
general. For instance, ECMO support for ARDS in patients with Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) reduced the in-hospital mortality rate to 65% and decreased
length of intensive care unit stay when compared to conventional therapy(16). However, a pooled
analysis of early ECMO support in COVID-19 patients reported a 94% in-hospital mortality rate
as compared to 70.9% with conventional therapy (11). Query of the Extracorporeal Life Support
Organization (ELSO) registry as September 15, 2020, demonstrated that 895 COVID-19 patients
have required ECMO support with the majority still on ECMO, and 51% in-hospital mortality
(www.elso.org). In our study, we report survival and clinical improvement in 10 out of 12 COVID19 patients who were administered with MSCs.
Despite encouraging efficacy of MSC administration in pre-clinical models of viral
infection, there are limited published clinical data available for various viral infections. For
instance, MSC infusion in ARDS induced by epidemic Influenza A (H7N9) had a reduced mortality
to 17.6% when compared to non-administered control with a mortality of 54.4% (17). More
specifically for COVID-19, a Chinese study of 7 patients reported that the intravenous
administration of adult MSCs improved the clinical status and oxygenation, reduced inflammation,
increased anti-inflammatory cytokines, and led to the discharge of all administered patients(15).
Even so, the major limitation of the latter study is that the 7 COVID-19 patients were not
categorized as having severe ARDS, rather they had at most mild ARDS.
In our study, we administered MSCs to 12 patients admitted to hospital with severe ARDS,
9 of whom had a requirement for ECMO support. MSC intravenous administration had no serious
adverse effects. Timing of MSC administration may be critical to achieve a more robust clinical
response as most of the patients received MSCs late in their hospital course. This report offers
an important clinical insight as all ongoing or planned clinical trials for cell-based infusions
excludes ECMO COVID-19 patients who are the most critically ill and therefore challenges the
therapeutic MSC intervention to its highest capacity. Considering the high mortality of COVID-19

ECMO administered patients, MSC infusion needs to be further evaluated in this highly selective
gravely ill patient population as well as less severe ARDS patients.
This study has important limitations that warrant mention. First, this was a small clinical
experience of 12 patients that lacked a randomized control group. Nonetheless the ability to
compare mortality with a contemporaneous control group and a world-wide global experience is
supportive of the potential clinical merits of this approach. In addition, the change in PaO2/FiO2 ,
SOFA and VEGF-A and IL12p70 levels after MSC infusion provided encouraging positive
endpoints that warrant further investigation of MSC infusion. Second, all patients received
additional therapies during their hospital stay which may have influenced patient outcomes
independently of or additive to the MSC infusion. Third, this case series cannot discern whether
this infusion will reduce in-hospital mortality if scaled up for broad clinical use, although this
analysis provides an intriguing summary patient response in North America that are fairly
consistent with reports from China.
In this preliminary series of 12 critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, most
requiring ECMO support, clinical status improved after MSC infusion. While this study only reports
results from relatively few patients, this experience suggests that a patient population with great
unmet need, like ECMO patients, who are often excluded from current clinical trial design should
be studied in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. MSCs may represent a potentially safe antiinflammatory therapy that can contribute to patient recovery in the most severe forms of COVID19 pneumonia.

Figure 2. Changes in multiplex biomarkers relative to baseline defined as concentration of the
blood sample obtained immediately prior to MSC infusion (x-axis) and subsequent collections

Interleukin-1b (IL-1b; 5D) in pg/mL. Point shapes represent individuals receiving the MSC
infusion (n= 6). Black points represent samples 3 days after the first MSC infusion (n= 6),
blue points represent samples taken 3 or 4 days after the second MSC infusion (n= 5), red
points represent samples taken 2 days after the third MSC infusion (n= 2). The dark dash line
of identity indicates no change from baseline. Dashed grey lines represent lower limits of
detection for each biomarker and all data were within the limits of detection. Proportions (with
95% confidence intervals) of post-MSC infusion biomarker that were less than or equal to
baseline biomarker levels are presented based on logistic regression models using
generalized estimating equations with an independent correlation structure to account for
within-person repeated measures.

Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen was demonstrable in exosomes isolated from sera of
COVID-19 patients: A) Immunoblot results showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen
on sera collected on day 0 (pre-treatment) and significantly reduced on day 14 (post-treatment)
following MSCs therapeutic intervention. B) The intensity of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen and
exosome specific marker CD9 was quantified using image J and histogram represents significant
(p=0.006) reduction of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen level on day 14 following MSCs treatment. C)
Sera collected from additional COVID-19 patients treated with MSCs on day 0 and 14 showed the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen and significant reduction (p=0.05) compared on day 21.
D) Graphical representation shows significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen on day 21
compared to sera collected on day 0 and 14 from COVID-19 patients. E) Immunoblot results
shows the absence of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen in exosomes collected from healthy subjects
negative (N1 & N2) for COVID-19 and COVID-19 patient (P) derived exosomes served as positive
control. Optical density of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen and exosomes specific marker CD9 were
measured using ImageJ software (NIH). The level of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen in the exosomes
