SUMMARY

BCG vaccination induces heterologous protection against respiratory tract infections,
and in children improves survival independently of tuberculosis prevention. The
phase III ACTIVATE-2 study assessed whether BCG could also protect against
COVID19 in the elderly. In this double-blind, randomized trial, elderly Greek patients
were randomized (1:1) to receive either BCG revaccination or placebo at hospital
discharge, followed by 6 months observation for incidence of COVID19 infection.
BCG revaccination resulted in 68% risk reduction for total COVID19 clinical and
microbiological diagnoses (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.79). Five patients in the placebo
group and one in the BCG-vaccinated group had severe COVID19 that necessitated
hospitalization. 3 months after BCG vaccination 1.3% of placebo and 4.7% of BCGvaccinated volunteers had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These data argue that BCG
revaccination is safe and protects the elderly against COVID19. BCG revaccination
may represent a viable preventive measure against COVID19.

INTRODUCTION

In December 2019, a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus was detected in a
patient with pneumonia in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province of China (Huang
et al., 2020). The virus that was subsequently isolated and sequenced was named
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the
disease it causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 spread around
the world since the beginning of 2020, causing a pandemic that brought suffering
and death to millions of people, and has caused the most severe healthcare
emergency in the world since World War II.

The most important preventive tool against a new infection are vaccines, and a
concerted effort has been launched around the world for the development of COVID19 vaccines. As the beginning of 2021, a mere one year later, several new and
effective vaccines against this new infection have been developed, based on both
old (inactivated virus, recombinant proteins) and new (mRNA technology, adenovirus
vectors) platform technologies (Forni and Mantovani, 2021). Vaccination programs
with several of these vaccines have been initiated, and the beneficial impact of
vaccination on the pandemic in countries that managed to vaccinate a significant
proportion of the population is already starting to be felt (Amit et al., 2021).
Unfortunately, the design and development of successful specific vaccines is timeconsuming, with shortages of vaccines being encountered in the majority of
countries: it is expected that 2 to 3 years will be needed until vaccines will be
sufficiently available to all countries.

These inherent challenges posed by the development of completely new vaccines
against a new pathogen argue for the identification of alternative preventive
approaches that could at least partially protect the population until specific vaccines
are developed and become available. One such approach that has been proposed
for the prevention of COVID19 is the use of live-attenuated vaccines with known
protective effects against heterologous infections (Netea et al., 2020). Bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but
epidemiological studies have suggested its capability to protect also against other
infectious diseases (Benn et al., 2013). In infants, early administration of BCG
vaccination leads to reduced child mortality, mainly as a result of reduced neonatal
sepsis and respiratory infections (Aaby et al., 2011; Biering-Sørensen et al., 2012;
Prentice et al., 2021), while revaccination with BCG in adolescents has shown a 70%
decrease in the incidence of respiratory tract infections compared to placebo (Nemes
et al., 2018). In addition, we also recently demonstrated in a randomized placebocontrolled trial (ACTIVATE), that BCG revaccination in elderly individuals can induce
up to 80% reduction of the incidence of respiratory tract infections (GiamarellosBourboulis et al., 2020).

These earlier observations have led to the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may
induce protection against COVID-19 as well (O'Neill and Netea, 2020). This
hypothesis seems to be supported by a number of ecological studies that suggest an
association between childhood vaccination and a low prevalence and severity of
COVID-19 in various countries (Berg et al., 2020; Escobar et al., 2020).
Retrospective studies of BCG vaccinated individuals have also shown that BCG is
safe in the context of COVID-19 (Moorlag et al., 2020), and seems to be associated

with protection against the infection or its severity (Rivas et al., 2021). Based on
these intriguing arguments for a potential beneficial effect of BCG against COVID-19,
a number of clinical prospective trials have been initiated around the world to
investigate the effects of BCG vaccination (Junqueira-Kipnis et al., 2020; Madsen et
al., 2020; Ten Doesschate et al., 2020). No data are yet available regarding the
effect of BCG vaccination in the controlled settings of a randomized controlled trial.

The ACTIVATE-2 study is a placebo-controlled phase III trial for the investigation of
the impact of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 in individuals at high-risk for
COVID-19. High-risk was defined 50 years or more with comorbidities. In a cohort of
individuals at high-risk from Greece, we observe that BCG revaccination results in an
68% reduction of the relative risk to develop COVID-19, compared with placebovaccinated controls, during a 6-months follow-up. In the placebo group five patients
needed hospitalization due to COVID-19 complications, while only one patient in the
BCG revaccination group had severe COVID19. These data suggest a potentially
important role of BCG revaccination as a complementary tool against the pandemic.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics are comparable between the two arms of vaccination
516 eligible participants were screened between June 2020 to October 2020. The
first participant was enrolled on June 6, 2020 and the follow-up of the last participant
was completed on April 19, 2021. No other people were willing to participate after

October 2020 as the start of the regular vaccination programs for the general
population has already been announced. Among them, 215 individuals were
excluded due to positive skin tuberculin test (n=208), hematological malignancies
(n=3), positive COVID19 serology, steroids, solid malignancy and chemotherapy
(n=1 for each condition). 301 patients were randomized to double-blind vaccination:
153 individuals received placebo, and 148 individuals received BCG (Figure 1). 3months interim analysis included 153 patients allocated to placebo vaccination and
148 patients allocated to BCG vaccination. Baseline characteristics were similar
between the two arms (Table 1). 55 individuals were lost to follow-up in the placebo
group, and 56 individuals in the BCG vaccination group after the first three months;
as such, 6-month analysis was performed in 98 placebo-vaccinated individuals and
92 BCG-vaccinated individuals.

BCG vaccination decreases the incidence of COVID-19
The primary outcome of the trial was incidence of a new COVID-19possible/probable/definitive infection during the first 3-month period of follow-up after
vaccination. This was a composite endpoint that included symptoms compatible with
COVID-19 and/or the microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. During these first 3
months after the vaccination the overall incidence of COVID-19 in Greece was low,
and thus the number of COVID-19 diagnoses was low in both groups (10 patients in
placebo vs. two patients in BCG group, p=0.086). In contrast, 6-months after
vaccination, the total number of COVID-19 diagnoses (possible/probable/definitive)
was significantly lower in the BCG-vaccinated group compared with the placebo
group: OR 0.32 in multivariate analysis (95% CI 0.13-0.79, p=0.014) (Table 2).

Definitive diagnosis of severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization was present in 5
individuals in the placebo group and only one in the BCG group.
Safety analysis

The number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was low and did not
differ significantly between the placebo and BCG-vaccinated individuals, with the
exception of erythema at the injection site which was more often reported in the
BCG-vaccinated group, as expected (Table 3). None of the patients developed
tuberculosis of systemic BCG-itis.

COVID-19 serology in placebo- and BCG-vaccinated individuals
At 3-months after vaccination, 300 volunteers donated blood for the assessment of
specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, in order to diagnose asymptomatic
infections. Interestingly, although the difference observed between the groups did
not reach statistical significance, positive COVID-19 serology was measured in only
1.3% (2/153) individuals who received placebo, compared to 4.7% (7/148)
volunteers who received BCG vaccine (p=0.099).

DISCUSSION

In this study we present the data of the first phase III placebo-controlled randomized
trial of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 to be completed. BCG vaccination
resulted in a significantly reduced incidence of possible/probable/definitive COVID19 in an elderly population 6-months after vaccination, compared to the placebo

group. Although the number of severe infections was small, hospitalization due to
severe COVID-19 occurred in five individuals vaccinated with placebo, but in only in
one of the BCG-vaccinated elderly volunteers. These data argue for a potentially
important role of BCG revaccination in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ACTIVATE-2 trial was initiated based on the capacity of BCG to: i. reduce the
incidence of respiratory tract infections in children and adults (Aaby et al., 2011;
Biering-Sørensen et al., 2012; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Nemes et al.,
2018; Prentice et al., 2021); ii. exert antiviral effects in experimental models
(Spencer et al., 1977); iii. reduce viremia in an experimental human model of viral
infection (Arts et al., 2018); and the demonstrated safety in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic (Moorlag et al., 2020). We hypothesized that BCG vaccination
may induce (partial) protection against susceptibility to and/or severity of SARS-CoV2 infection, and this hypothesis was confirmed by the clinical data showing 68%
reduction of COVID-19 retrospective diagnoses in the vaccinated individuals. While
the data of the current study are in line with a number of studies showing an
association between countries that implement BCG vaccination at birth and a low
prevalence of COVID19 (Berg et al., 2020; Escobar et al., 2020), not all studies were
however able to reproduce these findings (Hamiel et al., 2020; Wassenaar et al.,
2020). Ecological studies are also prone to bias, and thus such arguments based on
ecological analyses need to be considered with caution. On the other hand, other
recent studies have also shown reduced COVID-19 incidence in an observational
study of recent BCG vaccination (Amirlak et al., 2020), and a reduced severity of the
disease in children vaccinated with BCG (Chen et al., 2021), all which support the
observation reported here of a protective effect of BCG.

It has been recently demonstrated that the non-specific beneficial effects of BCG
vaccination are due to epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune
cells such as myeloid cells and NK cells, leading to an increased antimicrobial
activity, a process termed ‘trained immunity’ (Netea et al., 2016). Upon stimulation
with certain microorganisms, the innate immune system becomes primed and is able
to react faster and more efficient to secondary (and non-related) stimuli. In
experimental studies, BCG has been shown to protect not only against bacterial and
fungal infections, but against viral infections such as influenza as well (Spencer et
al., 1977). Furthermore, we recently showed that in volunteers receiving yellow fever
vaccine virus, those who had recently received BCG had – compared to placebotreated subjects – less viremia, and improved anti-viral responses (Arts et al., 2018).
The reduction in viremia correlated with myeloid-dependent trained immunity
responses, rather than specific lymphocyte-dependent immune memory (Arts et al.,
2018). The potential important role of trained immunity for the protection against
COVID-19 is supported by the observation of enhanced innate immune responses
post-vaccination in our recent ACTIVATE trial as well (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al.,
2020).

An intriguing observation was made when COVID-19 serology was investigated, in
order to identify the potential asymptomatic cases: only 1.3% of the placebovaccinated individuals were positive, while 4.7% of the BCG-vaccinated individuals
showed positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. While the difference was not
statistically significant due to the low numbers and it may be just by accident, it is
tempting to speculate that this is a real observation: earlier studies have

demonstrated that BCG improves serological responses to other vaccines (Leentjens
et al., 2015; Ritz et al., 2013), and it may induce similar effects in asymptomatic
COVID-19 infections. It has been demonstrated that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19
infections induce low antibody responses (Bölke et al., 2020; Kutsuna et al., 2020;
Terpos et al., 2020; Yang and Ibarrondo, 2020): in contrast, a previous BCG
vaccination may improve this and indirectly induce in an increased protection against
the infection in individuals asymptomatically infected with SARS-CoV-2. Future
studies are warranted to explore and validate this hypothesis.

Studies that investigated BCG vaccination have been recently initiated in a number
of countries around the world both in children and adults. It is interesting to observe
that a certain pattern starts to emerge in which trials in developing countries or
countries that employed BCG vaccination programs show beneficial effects of BCG
re-vaccination, while countries in which first BCG vaccination is administered in
naïve populations of developed countries the effect seems to be less strong. In
children, clinical trials in Africa have shown significant protection of BCG vaccination
against mortality (Aaby et al., 2011; Biering-Sørensen et al., 2012) and infections
(Prentice et al., 2021), but such effect failed to materialize in a recent large trial in
Denmark (Stensballe et al., 2019). Interestingly however, in the Calmette study from
Denmark, BCG vaccination induced a 30% protection of the child against infections if
the mother was also BCG-vaccinated, while no effect was seen if the mother never
received BCG (Berendsen et al., 2020). Similarly, BCG revaccination in SouthAfrican adolescents resulted in 73% less infections (Nemes et al., 2018), while BCG
vaccination in Greek elderly resulted in 80% less respiratory tract infections
(Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020). While we do not have information regarding

the BCG vaccination status of the volunteers in the ACTIVATE-2 trial, Greece had a
policy of BCG vaccination at birth in the temporal interval when the volunteers from
this trial were born. The positive data in the present study contrasts the results of a
recent interim analysis of the BCG-PRIME study from the Netherlands that
suggested lack of significant effects of BCG vaccination (UMC Utrecht, 2021).
Altogether, these data suggest important differences in the protective effects of BCG
revaccination vs. BCG first vaccination, and these need to be investigated in future
studies.

The present study also has limitations. The most important limitation is the small size
of the study. Although the strong impact of BCG vaccination allowed to reach
important conclusions regarding the effect on COVID-19, larger studies that are
currently under way in different countries need to confirm the data of ACTIVATE-2.
Another limitation is represented by the lack of microbiological testing in all patients
with a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable COVID-19. Although we cannot
exclude an alternative diagnosis is some of these patients, the context of the
pandemic during tight societal restrictions makes COVID-19 diagnosis the most
likely.

Because of the small size of the study, no conclusions can be drawn

regarding the effect of BCG vaccination on the severe forms of COVID-19, although
the difference of hospitalizations between placebo and BCG groups suggests
potential protection of the vaccination. A fourth limitation of the study is the lack of
information regarding the SARS-CoV-2 strains that caused the infections in this
study, and future studies need to investigate this aspect as well. Finally, we have
limited information regarding the impact of BCG on the specific immunological host

defense pathways against SARS-CoV-2 (specific antibodies and T-cell responses),
and additional investigations should investigate these effects in more detail.

When considering the availability of the novel specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,
one could ask why do we need trials investigating the effect of BCG against COVID19. There are several important reasons why such studies are still very important.
First, the availability of the specific vaccines is limited, especially in developing
countries: as the majority of developing countries have programs of neonatal BCG
vaccination, a strategy using BCG revaccination could have important impact on the
COVID-19 pandemic until the specific vaccines are available. Second, our ability to
control the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously challenged by the appearance of
new variants of the virus, some of them that show increased escape rates against
the newly developed vaccines (Kustin et al., 2021). The employment of trained
immunity-based vaccines that boost anti-viral host defense in an antigenindependent manner could thus prove very important in situations in which such viral
variants become most prevailing. Third, the principle that heterologous vaccines can
be employed with success in the real-life situation of a pandemic is extremely
important for future pandemic preparedness: it is conceivable that a strategy
employing such vaccines can be used as ‘bridge vaccination’ for partial protection of
the population even before specific vaccines are available (Netea et al., 2020). It is
to be hoped that the results of the present study will encourage more research for
identifying the most effective set of heterologous vaccines that can be stored, tested,
and used in a future pandemic to avoid the high healthcare, societal and economic
toll that can be exerted by a dangerous new pathogen.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

ACTIVATE-2 clinical trial

ACTIVATE-2 (A randomized clinical trial for enhanced trained immune responses
through Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination to prevent infections by COVID-19) is
a prospective, double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial
conducted among the general population in 11 departments of Internal Medicine in
Greece. The protocol and its subsequent amendments were approved by the
National Ethics Committee (approval 52/20) and by the National Organization for
Medicine of Greece (approval IS 045-20) (EudraCT number 2020-002448-21;

Clinicaltrial.gov NCT04414267). The trial was sponsored by the Hellenic Institute for
the Study of Sepsis. The funders have no role in the design, conduct, analysis and
interpretation of data, and decision to publish. The database lock was done on April
28th 2021. The investigators remained blind to the intervention until the results of the
analysis became known.

Study participants were informed about the study by either announcement in the
media or through advertisements that were put on each of the 11 participating
hospitals. Enrolled participants should be of either gender, aged 50 years or older
and have history of coronary heart disease of or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease or have Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI) more than 3. Enrolled people
should also have skin tuberculin test diameter less than 10mm and negative serum
testing for immunoglobulin G and M against SARS-CoV-2. Exclusion criteria were:
infection

by

the

Human

Immunodeficiency

Virus-1

(HIV-1);

primary

immunodeficiency; solid organ transplantation; bone marrow transplantation; intake
of chemotherapy the last two months; intake of radiotherapy the last two months;
active hemalogical or solid tumor malignancy; intake of any anti-cytokine therapies;
intake of oral or intravenous steroids defined as daily doses of 10mg prednisone or
equivalent for longer than the last 3 months. All participants provided written
informed consent before enrolment.

Assessment of eligibility was done after thorough study of the patient past history.
For eligible participants, skin tuberculin test was done by intradermal injection of
0.1ml of tuberculin in one forearm. Participants were asked to return after 48 to 72
days and in the case of diameter of the test less than 10mm they were subject to
measurement of anti-SARS IgG/IgM antibodies. Antibodies were measured using the

WIZ Biotech rapid measurement kit and employing single drops of blood from the
forefingers. Participants negative for antibodies were allowed to be vaccinated.
Vaccination was done with the subdermal injection of 0.1ml of sodium chloride 0.9%
or with 0.1ml of BCG vaccine. The studied BCG Vaccine is a live freeze-dried
vaccine derived from attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis (Bacillus Calmette
Guerin Moscow strain 361- I) and each 0.1 ml contains 2 to 8x 105 colony forming
unis. The intradermal injection of NaCl (placebo) or BCG (active vaccine) was done
in the deltoid region.

Following vaccination patients were asked to return at the study site for four more
times (study visit 2 on days 45 ±5 from date of visit 1; study visit 3 on days 90 ±5
from date of visit 1; study visit 4 on days 135 ±5 from date of visit 1; and study visit 5
on days 180 ±5 from date of visit 1). Study visits 2, 5 and 6 could also be phone
visits. On each visit patients were thorough asked for any adverse events (AE). Then
they were asked if they had suffered from COVID-19 diagnosed with molecular test.
These cases were considered as patients with definitive COVID-19. Then
participants were asked to provide answers to a questionnaire if they had
experienced COVID-19-related symptoms. The combinations of answers allowed to
classify them as sufferers from possible or probable COVID-19. Participants were
also subject to a second rapid test for anti-SARS IgG/IgM antibodies on visit 3.

The primary outcome was assessed on visit 3 (90 ± 5 days from the date of visit 1)
as the incidence of total cases of possible/probable/definitive COVID-19 the first 90 ±
5 days post vaccination. The incidence of total cases of possible/probable/definitive
COVID-19 the first 135 ± 5 days post vaccination and the first 180 ± 5 days post
vaccination were the secondary study endpoints (visits 4 and 5 respectively).

TEAEs and Serious TEAEs were captured from baseline until the last patient’s
evaluation. An adverse event was defined as any undesirable medical occurrence in
a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily
have a causal relationship with this treatment. The adverse event could be a sign, a
symptom, or an abnormal laboratory finding. AEs meeting any of the following
criteria

were

considered

SAEs:

death;

life-threatening

situation;

inpatient

hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant
disability/incapacity;

congenital

anom-

aly/birth

defects;

important

medical

events/experiences; and spontaneous and elective abortions experienced by study
subject. All others AEs were reported as non-serious. All AEs were graded as: mild
(transient and well-tolerated by the patient), moderate (causing discomfort and
affecting the usual activities of the patient) and severe (affecting the usual activities
to an important de- gree and causing disability or are life-threatening). The
relationship of the AE to the study drug was reported as probably-related, possiblyrelated; probably not-related and unrelated

Statistical analysis
Results of qualitative variables were expressed as percentages and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) and of quantitative variables as means and standard error.
Comparisons between placebo-vaccinated and BCG vaccinated individuals was
done by the Fisher’s exact test and by the Student’s t-test respectively. Step-wise
logistic regression analysis was done to investigate the variables associated with
probable/possible/definitive COVID-19 until visit 5. The COVID-19 cases entered the
