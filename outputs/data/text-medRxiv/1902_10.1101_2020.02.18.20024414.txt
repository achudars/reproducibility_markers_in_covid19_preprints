The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a distinctive algebraic, subexponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial
exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. Although
case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t µ is surprisingly
universal, with a range of exponents µ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite
of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese
provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that
effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures
both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed
scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit
the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the
observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic
behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the
implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere
or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.

I. INTRODUCTION

The current outbreak of the new coronavirus in Mainland
China (COVID-19, previously named 2019-nCoV) is closely
monitored by governments, researchers, and the public alike
[1–7]. The rapid increase of positively diagnosed cases in
Mainland China and subsequent exportation and confirmation
of cases in more than 20 countries worldwide raised concern
on an international scale. The World Health Organization
(WHO) therefore announced the COVID-19 outbreak a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern [4].
Confirmed cases in Mainland China increased from approx.
330 on Jan. 21st, 2020 to more than 17,000 on Feb. 2nd, 2020
in a matter of two weeks [8]. In Hubei Province, the epicenter
of the COVID-2019 outbreak, confirmed cases rose from 270
to 11,000 in this period, in all other Chinese provinces the
cumulated case count increased from 60 to 6,000 in the same
period.
An initial exponential growth of confirmed cases is generically expected for an uncontrolled outbreak and in most cases
mitigated with a time delay by effective containment strategies and policies that reduce transmission and effective reproduction of the virus, commonly yielding a saturation in the
cumulative case count and an exponential decay in the number of new infections. Although in Hubei the number of cases
was observed to grow exponentially in early January [9], the

subsequent rise followed a sub-exponential, super-linear, algebraic scaling law t µ with an exponent µ = 2.3 (between
Jan. 24th and Feb. 9th), cf. Fig. 1A. For the majority of the
affected Chinese provinces of Mainland China, however, this
type of algebraic rise occured from the beginning, lacking an
initial exponential growth altogether. Surprisingly, the exponent µ does not vary substantially with a typical value of
µ = 2.1 ± 0.3 for the confirmed case curves in other substantially affected provinces (confirmed case counts larger than
500 on Feb. 12th), despite geographical, socio-economical
differences, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneties that may have variable impacts on how the local epidemic unfolds, cf. Fig. 1B and C.
The universality of the scaling relation t µ with similar exponents µ is evidence that this aspect of the dynamics is determined by fundamental principles that are at work and robust
with respect to variation of other parameters that typically
shape the temporal evolution of epidemic processes. Three
questions immediately arise, (i) what may be the reason for
this functional dependency, (ii) are provinces other than Hubei
mostly driven by export cases from Hubei and therefore follow a similar functional form in case counts as suggested by
preliminary studies [10–12], or, alternatively, (iii) is the scaling law a consequence of endogeneous and basic epidemiological processes and a consequence of a balance between
transmission events and containment factors.
Here we propose a parsimonious epidemiological model
that incorporates quarantine measures and containment policies. In addition to standard epidemiological parameters such

as transmission and recovery rate, the model introduces effective quarantine measures that act on both, symptomatic
infected individuals as well as susceptible individuals. We
show that depleting both “ends” of the transmission interactions that involve an infectious and a susceptible individual
naturally yields a sub-exponential, algebraic increase in confirmed cases. This behavior is qualitatively different from the
behavior expected in a scenario in which only infecteds are
targets of containment strategies to reduce transmission. In
this case one expects either a stable exponential growth at a
lower rate or an exponential decay if mitigation is sufficiently
effective.
The model predicts the observed growth of case numbers exceptionally well for almost all affected provinces for
epidemiological parameters estimated by preliminary studies
[6, 7, 11, 13]. Furthermore, the model permits an indirect assessment of the peak time in the number of undetected infec-

tious individuals (asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic cases)
that preceeds the depletion of confirmed cases. This indicates
that the number of unidentified infectious indviduals peaked
in early February.

II. SITUATION ASSESSMENT
A. Case numbers in Hubei and other provinces

We rely on case number data provided by the Systems Science and Engineering group of Johns Hopkins University who
currently give up to two updates per day on the number of
laboratory-confirmed cases globally [8]. For the time period
discussed in this paper, the group integrated and curated case
data manually collected at four sources: the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention (CDC), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Chinese physician’s platform
DXY.cn, and the National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China (NHC). The published data comprises total
confirmed cases, total deaths, and total recovered cases as a
function of time for each affected location. In the following
we will focus on the number of total confirmed cases C(t).
In Hubei, we find that the initital increase in confirmed
cases is followed by an algebraic scaling with time, i.e.
C(t) ∝ t µ , with a scaling exponent µ ≈ 2.3 that persisted until
Feb. 9th, see Fig. 1A. On Feb. 12th, the case definition was
changed by Chinese authorities which labeled a large number of previously unconfirmed cases as confirmed, leading to
a discontinuity in the curves. We will therefore only consider
data prior to Feb. 12th, 6am UTC.
Fig. 1B illustrates the cumulated case count in all affected
provinces except Hubei province. In the period Jan. 21st until Feb. 2nd the curve follows an algebraic scaling law t µ
with µ ≈ 1.9 lacking the initial exponential phase observed
in Hubei province. Starting on Feb. 2nd, the observed case
count starts deviating towards lower case counts. This poses
the question whether the observed behavior is an averaging affect introduced by accumulating case counts across provinces.
Interestingly, Fig. 1C provides evidence that this is not so. The
confirmed case counts in the most affected provinces all exhibit a scaling law with exponents close to µ = 2. Among the
most affected provinces only Chongqing Province exhibits a
significantly lower exponent. Furthermore, all provincial case
count curves start deviating from the algebraic curve around
Feb. 2nd.

B. Implemented policies

The Chinese government put several mitigation policies in
place to contain the spread of the epidemic. In particular, positively diagnosed cases were either quarantined or put under
a form of self-quarantine at home [14]. Similarly, suspicious
cases were confined in monitored house arrest, e.g. individuals who arrived from Hubei before all traffic from its capital
Wuhan was effectively restricted [15, 16]. These measures
aimed at the removal of infectious individuals from the transmission process.
Additionally, measures were implemented that aimed at
the protection of the susceptible population by the partial
shutdown of public life. For instance, universities remained
closed, many businesses closed down, and people were asked
to remain in their homes for as much time as possible [14–
16]. These actions that affect both, susceptibles and nonsymptomatic infectious individuals, not only protect susceptibles from acquiring the infection but also remove a substantial
fraction of the entire pool of susceptibles from the transmission process and thus indirectly mitigate the proliferation of
the virus in the population in much the same way that herd
immunity is effective in the context of vaccine preventable
diseases.

III. EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELING WITH
QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION

On a very basic level, an outbreak as the one in Hubei
is captured by SIR dynamics [17]. The population is devided into three compartments that differentiate the state of invididuals with respect to the contagion process: (I)nfected,
(S)usceptible to infection, and (R)emoved (i.e. not taking part
in the transmission process). The corresponding variables S,
I, and R quantify the respective compartments’ fraction of the
total population such that S + I + R = 1. The temporal evolution of the number of cases is governed by two processes: The
infection that describes the transmission from an infectious to
a susceptible individual with basic reproduction number R0
and the recovery of an infected after an infectious period of
average length TI . The basic reproduction number R0 captures the average number of secondary infections an infected
will cause before he or she recovers or is effectively removed
from the population.
Initially, a small fraction of infecteds yields an exponential growth if the basic reproduction number is larger than
unity. When the supply of susceptibles is depleted, the epidemic reaches a maximum and the infecteds decline. A simple reduction of contacts caused by isolation policies could be
associated with a reduction in the effective reproduction number, which would, however, still yield an exponential growth
in the fraction of infecteds as long as R0 > 1, inconsistent with
the observed scaling law t µ discussed above. To test the hypothesis that the observed growth behavior can be caused by
isolation policies that apply to both, infected and susceptible
individuals, by effective public shutdown policies, we extend
the SIR model by two additional mechanisms one of which
can be interpreted as a process of removing susceptibles from
the transmission process. First, we assume that general public containment policies or individual behavioral changes in
response to the epidemic effectively remove individuals from
the interaction dynamics or significantly reduce their participation in the transmission dynamics. Secondly, we account
for the removal of symptomatic infected individuals by quarantine procedures. The dynamics is governed by the system
of ordinary differential equations:
∂t S = −αSI − κ0 S
∂t I = αSI − βI − κ0 I − κI
∂t X = (κ + κ0 )I,

a generalization of the standard SIR model, henceforth referred to as the SIR-X model. The rate parameters α and β
quantify the transmission rate and the recovery rate of the
standard SIR model, respectively. Additionally, the impact
of public containment is captured by the terms proportional
to the containment rate κ0 that is effective in both I and S
populations. Infected individuals are removed at rate κ corresponding to quarantine measures that only affect symptomatic
infecteds. The new compartment X quantifies symptomatic,
quarantined infecteds. Here we assume that the fraction X(t)
is proportional to the empirical confirmed and reported cases.
The case κ0 = 0 corresponds to a scenario in which the general population is unaffected by policies or does not commit

behavioral changes in response to an epidemic. The case κ = 0
corresponds to a scenario in which symptomatic infecteds are
not isolated specifically. Note that infecteds are always removed from their compartment I at a higher rate than susceptibles as β + κ + κ0 > κ0 .
In the basic SIR model that captures unconstrained, free
spread of the disease, the basic reproduction number R0 is related to transmission and recovery rate by R0 ≡ R0,free = α/β
because β−1 = TI is the average time an infected individual
remains infectious before recovery or removal. Here, the
time period that an infected individual remains infectious is
TI,eff = (β + κ0 + κ)−1 such that the effective, or “observed” reproduction number R0,eff = αTI,eff is smaller than R0,free since
both κ0 > 0 and κ > 0.
We introduce public containment leverage
P=

κ0
κ0 + κ

that reflects how strong isolation measures affect the general public in comparison to quarantine measures imposed on
symptomatic infecteds alone. We further define
Q=

κ0 + κ
β + κ0 + κ

as the quarantine probability, i.e. the probability that an infected is identified and quarantined either in specialized hospital wards or at home.
The key mechanism at work in the model defined by
Eqs. (1)-(3) is the exponentially fast depletion of susceptibles
in addition to isolation of infecteds. This effect is sufficient
to account for the observed scaling law in the number of confirmed cases for a plausible range of rate parameters as discussed below.
IV. RESULTS

We assume that a small number of infected individuals travelled from Hubei to each of the other affected provinces before
traffic restrictions were effective but at a time when containment measures were just being implemented. Fig. 2 illustrates
the degree to which the case count for Hubei province and the
aggregated case count for all other provinces is captured by
the SIR-X model as defined by Eqs. (1)-(3).
We find that for a wide range of model parameters, the case
count is well reproduced by the model. The model reproduces
the scaling law t µ as observed in the data for a significant period of time before saturating to a finite level. Remarkably, the
model is able to reproduce both growth behaviors observed
in the data: The model predicts the expected initial growth
of case numbers in Hubei Province followed by an algebraic
growth episode for ≈ 11 days until the saturation sets in, a consequence of the decay of unidentified infected individuals after a peak time around Feb. 7th (see Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the
model also captures the immediate sub-exponential growth
observed in the remaining most affected provinces (Fig. 2BC). Again, saturation is induced by a decay of unidentified
infecteds after peaks that occur several days before peak time

N, and resulting effective basic reproduction number R0,eff for Hubei
and the remaining majorly affected provinces discussed in the main
text, decreasingly ordered by largest case number. The infectious

to values TI = 8 d and R0,free = 6.2, respectively.

in Hubei, ranging from Jan. 31st to Feb. 5th. For all provinces,
following their respective peaks the number of unidentified infecteds I(t) decays over a time period that is longer than the
reported estimation of maximum incubation period of 14 days
[7, 13]. It is important to note that due to the uncertainty in
the population size, the numerical value of unidentified infecteds is sensitive to parameter variations—the general shape of
I(t), however, is robust for a wide choice of parameters, as
discussed in App. A.
Parameter choices for best fits were a fixed basic reproduction number of R0,free = 6.2 (note that this reproduction number corresponds to an unconstrained epidemic) and a fixed
mean infection duration of TI = 8 d consistent with previous reports concerning the incubation period of COVID-19
[7, 13]. The remaining fit parameters are shown in Tab. I.
For these values, the effective basic reproduction number is
found to range between 1.7 ≤ R0,eff ≤ 3.3 for the discussed
provinces, consistent with estimates found in previous early
assessment studies [6, 7, 18, 19].
A detailed analysis of the obtained values for quarantine
probability Q and public containment leverage P indicates
that a wide range of these parameters can account for similar shapes of the respective case counts. Consequently, the
model is structurally stable with respect to these parameters
and the numerical value is of less importance than the quality
of the mechanism they control (see App. A).
For the remaining 20 provinces, we find growth behaviors
similar to the ones discussed before. Some follow a functional form comparable to the case counts in Hubei, others
display a stronger agreement with pure algebraic growth, as
can be seen in Fig. 3. Generally, a stronger agreement with
algebraic growth can be associated with stronger public containment leverages.
In order to stress the general importance of public containment measures and to clarify to what extent quarantine is connected to case confirmation we also analyzed a model variant
where (i) the general public and infecteds are removed from

of R0,free = 6.2 and TI = 8d. Note that the effective, observed basic reproduction number R0,eff has lower values and varies for each of the
affected provinces as discussed in Sec. IV and shown in Tab. I. A: In Hubei, the model captures both, the initial rise of confirmed cases as well
as the subsequent algebraic growth. The confirmed cases are predicted to saturate at C = 51, 000. The model also predicts the time-course of
the number of unidentified infectious individuals I(t) which peaks on Feb. 7th and declines exponentially afterwards. While the order of I(t)
is associated with rather large fluctuations depending on the fitting procedure, the predicted peak time is robust, consistently around Feb. 7th.

the transmission process in the same way and (ii) case counting is decoupled from the quarantine process (see App. C).
We find that these model variants describe the real case count
data reasonably well for the majority of provinces, further evidence of the importance of containment policies that target
the susceptible population. In App. B we present further analytical evidence for this conclusion.
Note that the described saturation behavior of confirmed
cases requires that eventually all susceptibles will effectively
be removed from the transmission process. In reality, not every susceptible person can be isolated for such an extended

period of time as the model suggests. One might expect instead that the number of infecteds will decay more slowly and
saturate to a small, yet non-zero level. At this point it would be
crucial to identify unquarantined infecteds more efficiently in
order to completely shut down the transmission process. Due
to potential difficulties in upholding the containment policies
for such an extended period of time, we expect that our predictions will underestimate the final total amount of confirmed
cases.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we find that one of the key features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province but also
in all other provinces is the robust sub-exponential rise in the
number of confirmed cases according to the scaling law t µ
during the first episode of the epidemic. This general, almost
universal behavior is evidence that fundamental principles are
at work associated with this particular epidemic that are dominated by the interplay of the contagion process with endogeneous behavioral changes in the susceptible population and
external mitigation policies. We find that the generic scaling
of case counts with time is independent of many other factors
that often shape the time-course of an epidemic.
The model defined by Eqs. (1)-(3) and discussed here indicates that this type of behavior can generally be expected
if the supply of susceptible individuals is systematically decreased by means of implemented containment strategies or
behavioral changes in response to information about the ongoing epidemic. Unlike contagion processes that develop without external interference at all or processes that merely lead
to parametric changes in the dynamics, our analysis suggests
that non-exponential growth is expected when the supply of
susceptibles is depleted on a timescale comparable to the infectious period assiociated with the infection. The effective
depletion of the susceptible populations on a timescale κ0−1 in
the model does not imply that the pool of susceptibles must
be depleted in a physical sense. Rather, this depletion could
be achieved indirectly.
Containment that targets the susceptible population is a requirement for the observed algebraic scaling of case counts
with time, unlike the reduction of transmission rates, or the reduction of the duration infected individuals remain infectious.
Both of the latter measures address infected individuals only,
which leads to a reduction of the exponential growth rate of
new infections, or an exponential decay if the corresponding
measures are sufficiently effective, but do not alter the functional growth behavior.
The fact that scaling laws were observed in Hubei after an
initial exponential phase and that an exponential phase was
not observed in the other substantially affected provinces is
consistent with the model predictions if one assumes that the
response in the population and the effect of policies lagged the
onset of the epidemic in Hubei province and was immediate
in all other provinces that were in an alert status already when
cases were increasing substantially in Hubei province.
The model reproduces the empirical case counts in all
provinces well for plausible parameter values. The quality of
the reproduction of the case counts in all 29 affected provinces
can be used to estimate the peak time of the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic infected individuals in the population, which is the key quantity for estimating the time when
this outbreak will wane. The current analysis indicates that
this peak time was reached around Feb. 7th for Hubei and
within the first days of February in the remaining affected
provinces.
The model further suggests that the public response to the
epidemic and the containment measures put in place by the

Chinese administration were effective despite the increase in
confirmed cases. That this behavior was universally observed
in all provinces also indicates that mitigation strategies were
universally effective. Based on our analysis, we argue that the
implemented containment strategies should stay in effect for
a longer time than the incubation period after the saturation in
confirmed cases sets in for this particular outbreak.
Our analysis further implies and provides evidence that mitigation strategies that target the susceptible population and induce behavioral changes at this “end” of the transmission process are most effective to contain an epidemic—especially in
situations when asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infectious periods are long or their duration unknown. This may be
of importance for developing containment strategies in future
scenarios or if the current COVID-19 epidemic were to trigger
large scale outbreaks in other regions of the world by exports
and subsequent proliferation.

Appendix A: Fitting routine and analysis

Fits were performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt
method of least squares. We fixed the epidemiological parameters to duration of infection TI = 8 d and basic reproduction
number R0,free = αTI = 6.2. The population size N of each of
the affected Chinese provinces was obtained from the Geonames project [20] and is listed in Tab. I. For each confirmed
cases data set, we set the initial conditions X(t0 ) = C(t0 )/N,
I(t0 ) = (I0 /X0 )X(t0 ), and S(t0 ) = 1− I(t0 )− X(t0 ) where ti, C(ti )
is the i-th pair of a province’s time and aggregated confirmed
case number. Since the number of unidentified infectious is
unknown per definition, the prefactor I0 /X0 ≥ 1 was chosen
as a fit parameter. The remaining fit parameters were quarantine rate κ > 0 and containment rate κ0 > 0. For the fit
procedure, Eqs. (1)-(3) were integrated using the Dormand–
Prince method which implements a fourth-order Runge–Kutta
method with step-size control, yielding I(t) and X(t) for every parameter configuration and every data set. The residuals
were computed as R(ti ) = N X(ti ) − C(ti ).
We find that the model accurately reflects both the subexponential growth as well as the saturating behavior observed in the data discussed in the main text, with the obtained fit parameters displayed in Tab. I. For the 9 majorly
affected provinces and the aggregated data over all provinces
except Hubei, the quarantine probability is found to have similar values of Q = 0.6 ± 0.1. The public containment leverage is fluctuating more strongly with values ranging between
P = 0.07 and P = 1, where generally, lower values appear concurrently with a higher quarantine probability, which suggests
that stronger quarantine implementation requires less public

isolation. Yet, we advise not to overinterpret the values of
these fit parameters, as many different parameter values generate similar developments of confirmed cases.
As we fixed the population size to be equal to the total population of the respective provinces, one might also ask how
system size changes the results—for instance, if the outbreak
is contained in a small region of a province, the effective population available to the transmission process will be substantially smaller. Therefore, we repeated the fit procedure with
N as a free fit parameter to find that the form of X(t) is not altered substantially for different values of N, while I(t) can
vary more strongly as reflected by a larger variation in I0 .
This result suggests that the estimation of the number of infecteds is associated with a larger uncertainty. The general
shape of I(t), however, remains stable such that an inference
of the peak time of unidentified infecteds is reasonable. Furthermore, the model favours larger values of the containment
rate κ0 for larger population sizes in order to reproduce emprical data. This is a reasonable because the number of available
transmission pathways grows quadratically with the population size, making it easier for the disease to spread faster. In
order to still observe sub-exponential growth, a large part of
the susceptible population has to be removed quickly. Consistently, we find that a decay of susceptibles is necessary to reliably obtain the observed growth behavior (i.e. P > 0, κ0 > 0).
Concerning variation in the fixed model parameters, larger
values of up to R0,free = 12 yield results similar to the ones described above when adjusting the infectious period TI to larger
values, as well. For lower values of R0,free < 6, the model fails
to reproduce the scaling laws observed in the data. Similarly,
the fit results are reasonably robust against variations of the
duration of infection in a range of TI ∈ [6 d, 20 d] with concurrent adjustment of R0,free .
Similar effects are found for the remaining 20 affected
provinces for which model fits are displayed in Fig. 3 with
parameters given in Tab. II. In general, provinces with larger
values of public containment leverage P exhibit a stronger

Appendix B: Case-number development in early phase of the
epidemic

In a typical outbreak scenario only few people are infected
initially, such that S(0) = 1 − ε and I(0) =  with ε  1,
which implies that the depletion of susceptibles available to
the transmission process will be dominated by shutdown policies. This assumption effectively linearizes Eq. (1), yielding
the solution

Table II. Fit parameters as described in Sec. III, fixed population size
N, and resulting effective basic reproduction number R0,eff for the
remaining affected provinces, decreasingly ordered by largest case
number. The infectious period TI and the basic reproduction number
R0,free = αTI were fixed to values TI = 8 d and R0,free = 6.2, respectively.

For small values of t we can expand the exponent to obtain the
approximate growth function

Here, the first factor implies that quarantining infecteds
merely decreases the rate with which their number will grow
exponentially, while the second term suppresses the whole
transmission process well enough to alter the growth behavior. This implies that public shutdown policies facilitate epidemic containment in a more effective way than quarantine
measures.

In an alternative approach to the one discussed in the main
text one may assume that isolation affects all citizens equally,
i.e. κ = 0, but that the confirmation and counting of a new
case is decoupled from whether the respective person is quarantined or not—rather, an infected is discovered and counted

where as before, X will be equal to the number of confirmed

A numerical investigation of this alternative model shows
that confirmed case data can be reasonably fit for all
provinces, as well, which confirms the argumentation of
App. B that removal of susceptibles from the transmission
process is more effective than quarantine in mitigating epidemic spread.
