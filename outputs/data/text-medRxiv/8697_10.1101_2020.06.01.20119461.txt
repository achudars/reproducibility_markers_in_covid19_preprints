Covid-19 testing strategies and lockdowns:
the European closed curves, analysed by
“skew-normal” distributions, the forecasts
for the UK, Sweden, and the USA,
and the ongoing outbreak in Brazil
s the number of Covid-19 infections worldwide overtakes 6 millions of Total Confirmed
A
Cases (TCC), the data reveal almost closed outbreaks in many European countries.
Using the European data as a basis for our analysis, we study the spreading rate of Covid19 and model the Daily Confirmed Cases and Deaths per Million (DCCpM and DDpM)
curves by using “skew-normal” probability density functions. The use of these asymmetrical
distributions allows to get a more realistic prediction of the end of the disease in each
country and to evaluate the effectiveness of the local authorities strategies in facing the
European outbreak. The initial stage of the Brazilian disease is compared with the early
phase of the European one. This is done by using the weekly spreading rate of Covid-19.
For Sweden, UK, and USA, we shall give a forecast for the end of pandemic and for Brazil
the prediction of the peak of DDpM. We also discuss additional factors that could play an
important role in the fight against Covid-19, such as the fast response of the local authorities,
the testing strategies, the number of beds in the intensive care units, and, last but not least,
the measures of isolation adopted. The Brazilian mitigation measures can be placed between
the strict lockdown of many European countries and the Swedish approach, but clearly much
comparable to the European ones (in particular to the Netherlands).
Methods. For Brazil, the weekly spreading rates of Covid-19, as more people are getting
infected, was used to compare the outbreak in these countries with the ones of the European
countries when they were at the same stage of infection. In the early stage of the disease,
normal distributions have been used to obtain what we call a dynamic prediction of the
peaks. After reaching the peak of daily infections and/or deaths, skew-normal distributions
are required to correctly fit the asymmetrical DCCpM and DDpM curves and get a realistic
forecast of the pandemic end.
Findings. The European data analysis shows that the spreading rate of Covid-19 increased
similarly for all countries in its initial stage, but it changed as the number of TCCpM in each
country grew. This was caused by the different timely action of the authorities in adopting
isolation measures and/or massive testing strategies. The early stage of the outbreak in the
USA and Brazil shows for their α factor (DCCpM) a behaviour similar to Italy and Sweden,
respectively. For the β factor (DDpM), the American spreading is similar to the one of
Switzerland, whereas the Brazilian factor is greater than the ones of Portugal, Germany,
and Austria (which showed, in terms of TDpM, the best results in Europe) but, at the
moment, it is lower than the other European countries.
Interpretation. The fitting skew parameters used to model the DCCpM and DDpM curves
allow a more realistic prediction of the end of the pandemic and give us the possibility
to compare the mitigation measures adopted by the local authorities by analysing their
respective skew normal parameters (mean, mode, standard deviation, and skewness). In
Europe, Sweden and the UK show the greatest asymmetries, a kind of marathon instead
of the sprint of other European countries (as observed by Swedish authorities). This also
happens for the USA. The Brazilian weekly spreading rate for deaths is lower than most of
the European countries at the same stage of the outbreak.

I. Introduction
The study and development of models of infectious
disease dynamics surely plays a fundamental role in
facing an unknown outbreak. Nevertheless, such models often create controversy about how, when, and
whether their could be a useful tool in helping policy
decisions [1]. In the Covid-19 crisis, it seems that some
articles have been written more to convince the local
authorities than to scientifically discuss the real situation of the spreading of the outbreak in each country.
In this paper, we analyse how, in the early stage of
the pandemic, the mitigation strategies adopted by the
local authorities can be monitored by using the weekly
spreading rate of the countries, and, at the end of the
outbreak, how they can be evaluated by studying the
skew-normal distributions that fit the daily confirmed
cases and deaths curves of each country. It is clear
that the more timely the action of the local authorities
turns out to be, the more effective is the result. The
number of confirmed cases is only a reliable number if
a testing strategy is adopted. Without it, we do not
know in which stage of the disease the country is at a
certain time. Many of the European countries followed
a similar weekly spreading rate in their apparent early
stage of the disease, but, for example, for Italy/Spain
and Germany/Austria it led to completely different
results in facing the outbreak. As we shall see in detail later, the massive testing strategy adopted by the
German and Austria authorities created the positive
difference in favour of these countries.
Often, the countries are compared to each other by
using their Total Confirmed Cases (TCC). This is obviously misleading due to their different populations.
Nevertheless, the Total Confirmed Cases per Million
(TCCpM) could also be misleading. Let us for example
consider the following number taken by [2] on May,
30. Belgium, Spain, the UK, Italy, Iceland, and Singapore appear with a TCCpM number between 4000 and
6000. Are they in a similar situation in facing the
Covid-19 pandemic? The answer is immediately found
by looking at their number of Total Deaths per Million
(TDpM), which are 815, 580, 566, 551, 29, and 4 respectively. Showing a clearly different result in facing
the outbreak. New Zeland, Australia, South Africa,
and South Korea also have a mortality rate comparable with the Singaporean one, but their TCCpM are
around 300, well below than the TCCpM of Singapore.
It is important to observe that, without a vaccination, immunization also plays a fundamental role. So,
in the previous cases, Iceland and Singapore surely
obtained the best results in facing the Covid-19 outbreak, whereas the European countries had the worst
ones. The perfect way to face the outbreak is reaching the maximum number of immunization together
with a minimum number of deaths per million. This
point should be highlighted in scientific discussions
and, clearly, in the media information.

ΣδΛ

If a country does everything well and in time, the
mortality is controlled. If the action of the local authorities in adopting mitigation measures and testing
strategies is not effective, health care systems get overwhelmed and the mortality rate increases to critical
values. During the outbreaks in Italy and Spain, the
not timely action in preventing or isolating and a weak
testing strategy, led to collapsed healthcare systems
and the mortality rate reached scary values, despite
people being forced to stay at home, to leave their
houses only for shopping (food and other necessities),
for medical issues, and to travel to and from work only
when absolutely necessary. Brazil, in time, banned
international travel, football matches, and closed its
land borders, shut down all non-essential public services (first of all universities and primary and high
schools) and private businesses, with employees working from home, and commerce was restricted to supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants (for takeaway or
delivery only), gas stations and other critical services.
Despite its not effective testing strategy when facing
the outbreak, the timely action seems, at the moment,
to give good results in terms of deaths if we compare the early Brazilian stage of the disease to the
European one, where strict lockdowns were adopted.
Obviously Brazil is a big country, so when we talk
of good results, we need to be careful. Indeed, while
some Brazilian States plan to relax the quarantine
rules, others, which are facing a collapse of their health
systems, are planning, following the Europe example,
a strict lockdown with a ban of on unnecessary circulation of people and vehicles. Worldwide, we also
find different approaches. By quickly implementing
public health measures, Hong Kong demonstrated that
COVID-19 transmission can be effectively contained
without resorting to the strict lockdown adopted by
China, the USA, and Western Europe. The HongKong TCCpM is around 145 and the mortality of 0.5
(TDpM). As one of the most heavily affected epicenters
during the SARS epidemic in 2003, Hong Kong was
better equipped to face the Covid-19 outbreak compared to other countries. Improved testing, hospital
capacity to handle novel respiratory pathogens, population understanding the need to improve personal
hygiene and to maintain physical distancing made the
difference. In Europe, one country stands out in its
approach to tackle Covid-19. The Swedes take individual responsibility for social distancing. Their high
schools and universities were closed but the primary
schools, gyms, restaurants and bars remained open,
with social distancing rules enforced, while gatherings
were restricted to 50 people. The mortality rate per
million of inhabitants is lower than the one of Italy,
Spain, and the UK but higher than in neighbouring
Norway, Finland, and Denmark. Nevertheless, hospitals have, at the moment, not been overwhelmed as
it happened in Italy and Spain. There is no debate
over how to re-open society, and whether there will be

a second wave, because society has largely remained
open and the local consequences of a lockdown have
been avoided. As remarked by the local authorities,
Sweden opted for a kind of marathon instead of a sprint
to close the first Covid-19 wave.
A recent study from the Kings College London [3],
based on data from a survey of 2250 UK residents
aged 18-75, classified the members of the population
according to their response to the Covid-19 crisis and
lockdown measures. Three groups were identified: accepting (44%), suffering (47%) and resisting (9%). In
the resisting cluster, with an average age of 29 of which
64% are male, 58% think that “too much fuss is being made about the risk of coronavirus” (around six
times higher than in the other two groups), 76% go
against official guidance, such as meeting friends or
family outside home (41%) or going outside when having coronavirus-like symptoms (35%). The researchers
also observed that, differently to what happens for
the resisting people, where young people represent the
biggest number, the 55 to 75 year old people characterize by far the biggest proportion within the accepting group. Women make up nearly two-thirds of the
suffering cluster, while the contrary happens for the
resisting one, where men represent almost two-thirds of
the group. The study also focuses on the political distribution of the three groups and contains many other
detailed information that the reader can freely access
in ref. [3]. Worldwide, people spent weeks without
seeing friends and/or family, without school or university, holidays, sport or even being able to go to work.
So, stress, anxiety, depression, and pandemic fear are
a very common response to the lockdown measures
during the Covid-19 outbreak [4, 5].
To understand the mathematical reason of the lockdown, let us briefly talk about the basic reproduction
number, the so-called R0 number [6]. It determines
the number of infected people caused by one infected
person at the beginning of the outbreak, so before
widespread immunity starts to develop and/or any attempt has been made to reduce the spreading. The
down-script zero thus refers to the zero immunity in
the population. The R0 should not be confused with
Rt , which is the number of persons infected, at any
specific time, by an individual. It decreases as immunized people increase, either by vaccination, natural
immunity, or with their death. In case of Covid-19,
we still have no vaccination. So, a large percentage
of people immune to the infection (providing that the
disease will not spread rapidly within the population),
the so-called herd immunity [7], can only be reached
through two chains, i.e. natural immunity or death.
When the number of susceptible people decreases, as
people die or become immune by exposure, the Rt
number decreases too and the sooner the people recover or die, the smaller becomes the value of Rt . The
basic reproduction number predicts the ratio of immunization that a population requires to achieve herd

immunity. The critical immunity threshold for random
vaccination (assuming 100% vaccine effectiveness) is
(R0 −1)/R0 [7]. For a basic reproduction number of 2.5
(the Covid-19 reproduction number estimated in [8] for
Wuhan was 2.2) the threshold is thus given by 3/5 of
the population, i.e. 60%. For R0 = 5 (a recent study
calculated a reproduction number of almost 4.9 in the
first week of the outbreak in Iran [9]) the threshold
increases to 4/5 of the population, i.e. 80%. At any
time, the effective reproduction number, Rt , can be expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number, R0 ,
and the percentage of immunized people in the population at that time, Pimm (t), by Rt = R0 [1 − Pimm (t)].
Mitigation and isolation strategies are often used to
artificially reduce the reproduction number. For example, in Iran the basic reproduction number was 4.9
in the first week. After the closure of schools and
universities, the effective reproduction number was 4.5,
and, after a reduction in the working time, its value
decreased to 4.3 [9].
Without a vaccine, immunization at a much delayed
speed, ensuring that health services are not overwhelmed, is the only way to face the pandemic. Isolation (or lockdown when necessary) is surely the main

tool to allow those who suffer the most acute symptoms
to receive the medical support they need. Nevertheless, what mitigation measures should be adopted still
represents a matter of discussion and, surely, they cannot be taken without using massive testing strategies.
Indeed, testing people is not only important because
it shows, at a given moment, the real situation of the
outbreak and where it is growing, but it is also essential
to sensitise and empower people.

II. Massive testing strategy
Let us now discuss the numbers which appear in Table
1. The data was collected by the worldwide repositories: WorldoMeters [2], World Health Organisation [10],
and GitHub [11]. For the numbers of beds of Intensive Care Units, we used for the European countries
ref. [12], updated for Germany by [13], for the USA
ref. [14] reporting 96596 ICU beds (which means 292
beds per Million of inhabitants), with the following distribution Metropolitan, 94%, Micropolitan, 5%„ and
Rural, 1%, and, finally, for Brazil the data from [15]
reporting 46000 ICU beds (216 BpM) subdivided into
the five Brazilian regions, North, North-East, Central
West, South-East, and South, with the following percentages 4% (90 beds per Million), 19% (150 BpM),
10% (250 BpM), 52% (270 BpM), and 15% (220 BpM),
respectively.
At the 30th of May, the Total Deaths per Million
(TDpM) for twelve European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands,
Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and UK), the
USA and for the ten South American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador,
Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela) show the greatest
numbers of TDpM for the Italy, the UK, Spain, and
Belgium, with TDpM numbers of 551.1, 566.0, 579.6,
and 814.9, respectively. In these countries, the number
of Tests per Confirmed cases (TpC) is practically the
same (14.9 for Belgium and Soain, 15.3 for the UK,
and 16.4 for Italy) and their number of Total Confirmed Cases per Million (TCCpM) is between 3845.7
(Italy) and 5111.7 (Spain) leading to a mortality rate
of 16.2% for Belgium, 11.3% for Spain, 14.3% for Italy,
and 14.1% for the UK. Ireland and Switzerland, which
have a ratio of tests over confirmed cases comparable to
the one of the previous countries, have a lower mortality rate, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively. Observe that the
UK and Ireland have practically the same low number
of ICU beds (the WHO suggests a number between 100
and 300) but a different mortality rate. The same happens for Italy/Spain (BpM: 125/97) and Switzerland
(BpM: 110). Belgium, notwithstanding the good number of BpM, (159), has the worst mortality rate. Let
us now compare Sweden and the Netherlands, having
a TpC of 6.2 and 7.1, respectively, with the USA, TpC
of 9.1. For these countries the mortality rate is 11.8%
(Sweden), 12.8% (Netherlands), and 5.9% (USA). Here,

the great difference in the number of ICU beds and
the temporal shift in the beginning of the outbreak
(allowing a better preparation of the health system)
clearly played a fundamental role. For Brazil, which
has the lowest number of TpC (1.9), the mortality rate
is 5.8%, comparable to the one of the USA. It is clear
that for all the countries, due to the fact that there is
a good number of asymptomatic people, an increasing
number of tests should decrease the mortality rate.
Meaning, that when the number of tests for confirmed
people reaches the Spanish value, the Swedish, Dutch,
American, and Brazilian mortality rates should further decrease. Portugal (24.7), Germany (21.6), and
Austria (26.9) have the largest numbers of tests over
confirmed cases and show a very low mortality rate
4.3%, 4.7%, and 4.0%, respectively.
What has just been discussed shows that when comparing the mortality rate’s percentage, we have to take
care and consider the number of tests done per confirmed case. To correctly interpret any data, we need
to know how much testing for Covid-19 the country actually does. Without complete data, it is complicate to
know which countries are doing well and to understand
how the pandemic is spreading. When discussing the
Total Deaths per Million (TDpM), the number of tests

is not important. In this case, we have to consider
the stage of the outbreak. For example, this is the
case of the South American countries that are in a
different stage of infection compared to the one of the
European countries that are closing their first Covid19 wave. Looking at the TDpM number, a particular
case is called to our attention. In Tab. 1, amongst the
first four countries, Italy has the highest TpC number
(16.4), and Germany, below in the table, has a TpC of
21.6. Remembering that the two countries are both
closing their first wave of pandemic, how can their
large difference in the TDpM, 551.1 (Italy) and 101.8
(Germany), be justified?
To answer to this question, let us discuss the data
reported in Tab. 2 and collected for Austria, Germany,
and the four countries having the greatest numbers of
TDpM in Tab. 1 (Belgium Spain, Italy, and UK) by
the repository of Our World in Data [16]. At March 8,
Belgium, Austria, and Germany have a similar number
of TCCpM (between 10 and 20) but a different number of TpC: 20.3, 43.3, and 120.1 respectively. This
means that when the pandemic was in its initial stage
reaching the value of 10/20 TCCpM the Austrian testing strategy was twice more effective than the Belgian
one and Germany showed a massive testing strategy
six times more effective than Belgium and twice than
Austria. At March 8, the pandemic in Italy was at
an advanced stage counting 121.9 of TCCpM. So, to
compare the testing strategy of Italy with the one of
Germany, we have to go back to February 27 when
Italy counted 10.83 of TCCpM. The number of TpC
in Italy, when the disease reached 10/20 TCCpM, was
similar to Belgium. An easy way to compare the testing
strategy is normalising the TcP to one of the compared
countries. This allows to introduce the Effectiveness
Factor (EF) with respect to that country. For example,
by choosing Italy as the normalising country, the Belgian, Austrian, and German EF is given by 1.1, 2.3,
and 6.5 respectively. Repeating this for other intervals
of TCCpM, we find:

Testing far more people means to catch more inhabitants with few or no symptoms. Increasing the number
of known cases, but not the number of fatalities, we
obviously decrease the fatality rate and obtain a more
reliable number for the mortality rate of the pandemic.
Nevertheless, this is not the main goal of massive testing strategy. The strategy of early and widespread
testing allows to slow down the pandemic spreading by
isolating known cases while they are infectious and to
enable medical treatment in a more timely way, saving

ΣδΛ

lives. The possibility of an early diagnosis, avoiding
that a patient goes into a steep decline, clearly increases
the chance of survival.
Long before recording its first case of Covid-19 in
February, Germany, in mid-January, developed a test
and posted the formula online and laboratories across
the country had built up a stock of test kits [17]. This
allowed a massive testing strategy with respect to the
other European countries, as previously shown a factor
six in the beginning of the outbreak. The German
and Austrian massive testing strategy, in facing the
pandemic in its early stage, made the great difference.
In the final stage, massive testing is only useful to
reduce the mortality rate on the paper but not to save
many lives.
At the beginning of its outbreak, Germany conducted 120 tests per confirmed case, far more than any
other European country. Medical staff, at particular risk of contracting and spreading the virus, was
regularly tested. Physicians, nurses, and laboratory
technicians, adequately protected, drove in German
streets to test people, what they called corona taxi,
suggesting hospitalization even for patients with mild
symptoms, for more detail see ref. [17]. This was done
at absolutely zero cost for the population (differently,
for example, of what happened during the first several
weeks of the outbreak in the United States of America) and this guaranteed a broad-based testing. In
most countries, including the United States and Brazil,
testing was largely limited to the sickest patients. Testing and tracking was the successful strategy of South
Korea in Asia and Germany in Europe.
Social distancing measures are surely important to
flatten the pandemic curve, avoiding the collapse of
the national health care systems, a clear, detailed, and,
scientifically correct information is fundamental to reassure and calm the people, but, as already said before,
massive testing strategies make the great difference in
facing the Covid-19 outbreak.
Let us now make an important consideration about
absolute numbers, often used in the media: They cannot be used when comparing different countries. For
example, looking at the absolute numbers of tests,
on May, 30, for Germany and Italy we find 3824621
and 3952971, respectively. At first glance, the small
difference seems not to deserve a deep analysis of
their strategy. However, as shown in this section, the
massive testing strategy adopted by German, in the
early stage of the disease, led to different results in
terms of mortality rates, in favour of the German
people.
Other absolute numbers often used to compare countries are Total Confirmed Cases (TCC) and Total
Deaths (TD). For example, in the Covid-19 world
ranking of Worldometer [2] (which lists 215 countries),
the TCC and TD absolute numbers of Brazil, at the
30th of May, puts Brazil on position 2 for TCC (after
the USA) and on position 4 for TD (after the USA, the

UK, and Italy). To compare countries, we obviously
have to normalise using their population. Considering
the Total Confirmed Cases and Deaths per Million
(TCCpM and TDpM), Brazil descends on position 39
for TCCpM and 22 for TDpM.
In Figs. 1 and 2, we show the temporal behaviour of
the TCCpM and TDpM curves for the USA and for the
European and South American countries. The data of
Tab. 1 and the plots of Fig. 1 and 2, are periodically
updated on the webpage [19].
Before concluding this section, we would like to say
a few words on the Venezuelan numbers, see the last
row in Tab. 1. Its TDpM is of 0.5, the TCCpM of
51.4, and the TpC number is surprisingly of 669. Due
to its crisis, Venezuela was isolated from the world
even before the Covid-19 outbreak and was the first
nation in South America to apply a strict lockdown.
These facts could explain why the virus did not widely
spread in Venezuela. With respect to the high number
of tests, it is important to observe that they used a
massive number of a rapid blood antibody test (coming
from China and checking for proteins developing after
someone is infected). Few nasal swab exams have
been used by the local authorities. It is important to
recall that only swab-test positives are added in the
official statistics of confirmed cases. Including or not
the antibodies tests also explains why, for example, the
numbers of TCC for Spain in [2], where the antibody
tests are considered, and in [11], where they are not,
differ.

III. Weekly spreading rate
In this section, we discuss the weekly spreading rate
for DCCpM and DDpM. Before introducing what, for
simplicity, we shall call α [20] and β factors, we first
examine the comparison of the outbreak in different
countries. We shall analyse, as illustrative example,
two European countries, Germany and Italy, the USA,
and the Brazil. In these countries, the outbreak did not
start at the same time. So, we compare them with each
other, when they reached the same number of TCCpM.
Let us consider the moment in which they reached
10 TCCpM. This happened for Italy at the 27th of
February (TCCpM of 10.83), for Germany at 7th of
March (9.53), for the USA at 15th of March (10.69),
and, finally, for Brazil at 24th of March (10.58). To see
how the outbreak was spreading in these countries, we
can compare their DCCpM numbers. This can be done
by averaging on the weekly data centred on February,
27 for Italy, on March, 7 for Germany, 15 for the USA,
and 24 for Brazil, see the following table

In Fig. 3(a), we plot the α factor for the twelve
European countries and the USA. The weekly spreading rate of DCCpM shows its greatest values for Ireland
and Spain (around 200 and 180, respectively), followed
by Belgium and Switzerland (both around 130), with
the first three countries closing their first wave of pandemic with a TCCpM around 5000. Italy and Germany
show a maximum rate around 100 and 70, and a final
TCCpM around 4000 and 2000, respectively. Looking
at Fig. 4(a) all the European countries, with the exception of the Swedish case, present the same curves
for their initial weekly spreading rate. In particular,
the α factor of the USA followed, up to 1000 TCCpM,
the same curve of Italy. So, why do the European
countries show a different behaviour in the successive
stages of the outbreak?
The answer once again comes from the testing
strategy adopted by the local authorities. This can be
seen by observing the previous tables. At the 27th of
February, Italy, and, at the 15th of March, the USA
reached 10.83 and 10.69 TCCpM, respectively, with an
α factor of 3.63 for Italy and 2.81 for the USA. Due to
the fact that at that moment Italy and the USA tested
200 and 120 inhabitants per million, we can say that
they had in their initial stage a comparable behaviour.
The plots in Fig. 3(a) as well the amplification done in
Fig. 4(a), do not contain the testing normalisation. So,
the German curve is similar to the Italian and American ones. Nevertheless, looking at the last column,
we immediately seen a great difference in the testing
strategy of Germany (1490 TpM) with respect to Italy
(200) and the USA (120) leading to a German “relative”
α factor of
2.15 × (200/1490) ≈ 0.29 vs. 3.63 ,
in the case of Italy, and of
2.15 × (120/1490) ≈ 0.17 vs. 2.81 .
in the case of the USA. Reaching 100 TCCpM, the
German effective factor becomes
27.57 × (700/3010) ≈ 6.41 vs. 18.06 ,
and
27.57 × (760/3010) ≈ 6.96 vs. 25.07 .
Comparing the effective Brazilian α factor with the
Italian and American ones, we find

Data on the testing strategy adopted by the different
countries are often unevenly available. So the plots
given in Fig. 3(a) and 4(a), when they are used to
compare countries amongst each other, have to be
appropriately normalised by the relative ratio of TpM.
We recall one more time, that the success of a country in facing the pandemic is not to reduce the TCCpM
but to reduce its TDpM. Immunization also plays a
fundamental role in the battle against the disease. Obviously, reducing infections also has an effect on decreasing the rate of mortality. But, it is possible to find
many examples in which a great number of TCCpM
does not necessarily implies a great number of TDpM,
see for example the Ireland curves in Fig. 3.
Now, let’s analyse the weekly spreading rate of the
daily deaths per million, the so called β factor. It will
be done in perfect analogy with what has been done
for the daily confirmed cases per million. Taking as
illustrative example the previous countries, we obtain

In this case, the comparison can be done directly
without any testing normalisation. Obviously, subnotification of deaths has also to be taken into account
but, at the moment, we have not reliable information
on this. Between 10 and 20 TDpM, the tables show the
worst β factors for Italy and the best ones for Brazil.
Nevertheless, the increasing rate for Italy, Germany,
the USA, and Brazil, show the following factor 1.6,
1.4, 1.6, and 2.1, respectively. In Fig. 3(b), we see that
Ireland, despite its high values of TCCpM and peak
in DCCpM, will close the first wave of pandemic with
a number of TDpM between 300 and 400, well below
Belgium around 800 and Italy, Switzerland and Spain
with values between 550 and 650. The plots also show
the good result of Austria (<100), Germany (around
100), and Portugal (≤ 150). In Fig. 4(b), which is an
amplification of Fig. 3(b), Brazil overtakes the curves
of Austria, Germany, and Portugal (meaning that its
final TDpM will be obviously greater that 200) but is
still under the ones of the other European countries
and of the USA. We shall come back to this in section
V.

many natural phenomena. It describes how the values
of a variable are symmetrically distributed around its
centre, µ, and shows how the probabilities for extreme
values further away from the mean go rapidly to zero
in both directions. It is also known as the Gaussian
distribution and/or the bell curve. Normal distributions are often used to fit data because, in many cases,
the average of data of a random variable with finite
mean and variance, is itself a random variable whose
distribution, as the number of data increases, converges
to a normal distribution. Normal distributions have
also been used to fit the Covid-19 pandemic curves.
Nevertheless, their use led to misleading predictions
regarding the end of the outbreak in many countries.
Talking about forecasts, we always expect uncertainties
but, clearly, we must try to minimize them so that our
predictions can be as close as possible to reality. It
is well known that the curves of the epidemiological
models are asymmetric. So, why not use asymmetric
distributions to fit the data? In particular, why do not
use skew-normal distributions instead of the normal
ones?
It is clear that before reaching the peak, normal distributions can be used to estimate the pandemic curves
of DCCpM and DDpM. Indeed, eventual asymmetries
can only be seen after a country reached its peak. But,
to estimate the end of the outbreak, skew-normal distributions, as we shall see later, are fundamental to get
the right answer. Skew-normal distributions contain
an additional parameter (with respect to the normal
ones) which measures the asymmetry of the curves,
for a detailed review see [22–26]. A negative value
of this parameter indicates that the left tail is longer
(the peak is found at the left of µ) and a positive one
indicates that the right tail is longer (the peak moves
to the right of µ). In the figure, the blue line represents
a Gaussian centred at µ = 0 and with standard deviation σ = 3. The red line is a skew normal distribution
with a negative parameter, s = −2, and the green line
represents a skew normal distribution with a positive
parameter, s = 3.

The TCCpM and TDpM curves were modelled by using
the NonlinearModelFit calculation of the computational program Wolfram Mathematica [28]. The three
fitting parameters, with the respective 95% Confidence
Intervals, appear in Table 3. The CDF and PDF for
ten European countries, which are closing their first
pandemic wave, appear in Fig. 5 and 6. The DCCpM
plots in Fig. 6 clearly show their asymmetric nature.
This explains why the forecasts based on normal distributions, due to the lack of profile asymmetry, led
to misleading results, in most cases anticipating the
prediction of the end of the first epidemic wave.
The greatest asymmetries are found, for the confirmed cases, for the skew-normal distributions of
Portugal (γc = 0.94), and, for deaths, for Spain
(γd = 0.92). The most symmetric distributions belong to Ireland, γc = 0.33 and γd = 0.20, and France,
γc = 0.08, with a profile very similar to Gaussian
distributions.
By using the fitting parameters of the skew-normal
distributions, we can also obtain information about
the mean values of the DCCpM and DDpM curves.
For example, for Germany, Spain, Italy, and Belgium,
we find µc = 75.9, 75.4, 76.1, and 83.9, respectively,
showing that the epidemic began in the same period in
the first three countries and a week later in Belgium.

respectively. This shows that in Spain, Italy, and Belgium only people with moderate or severe symptoms
were being tested. One more evidence of the different
testing strategy adopted in the early stage of the outbreak by Spain/Italy/Belgium and Austria/Germany.
Before concluding this section, we observe that,
among the distributions plotted in Fig. 6, the Dutch
one shows a smooth growth and a peak (comparable
to the German one) lower than all the other distributions. The Netherlands tried to adopt a different
lockdown. In contrast to most other European countries, where people were virtually housebound, the
Dutch authorities opted for what they called an “intelligent” lockdown. The Dutch position, in many
aspects similar to the Swedish one, reflects the idea
that immunization also plays a fundamental role in
facing the pandemic. Despite their different approach
with respect to the strict lockdown of Belgium (TDpM:
814.9), Spain (579.6), UK(566.0), Italy (551.1), and
France (439.8), the Netherlands seems to have made
the right choice, closing their first wave of the disease
below the previous countries in terms of deaths per
million (348.0).

Table 4: The fitting parameters of the skew normal
distributions of the UK, Sweden, and the
USA.
• The UK, Sweden, and the USA.
The curves of the UK and Sweden are similar, regarding
the DCCpM and DDpM skewness and DDpM standard
deviation, to the Italian and Portuguese ones, respectively. The difference is found in the standard deviation
of DCCpM. The σc of the UK (42.4) is greater than
the one of Italy (32.3) and the σc of Sweden (95.8) is
the highest amongst all the countries studied in this
paper. The high Swedish standard deviation is a clear
consequence of the milder mitigation measures adopted
by the local authorities. Contrary to what will happen
for the other European countries, where once the first
phase of pandemic is closed and a new wave should
come, Sweden will probably face a single long period

ΣδΛ

of the pandemic. As stated by the local authorities,
a marathon (without sequential waves) instead of a
sprint to conclude the first wave of Covid-19.
The greater standard deviations of the DCCpM
curves of the UK and Sweden, with respect to the
standard deviations of their DDpM ones, leads to,
contrarily to what has been seen for other European
countries, mean values of DDpM located before the
ones of DCCpM,
{ µd , µc }UK
{ µd , µc }Sweden

= { 94.5 , 101.7 } ,
= { 106.5 , 141.1 } .

This result confirms what we discussed in the Introduction, i.e. when talking of the Covid-19 numbers,
it is fundamental to look at the deaths per million.
Predictions of the critical peak region for the DDpM
curves are clearly more important than the ones for
the DCCpM curves. When the DDpM curves cannot be modelled, because one of the three parameters
oscillates, we can resort to what we call dynamical
prediction. This happens for example, for Brazil where
the peak still shows an oscillating behaviour, we shall
come back to this point later.
The skew-normal predictions can be complemented
by the graphical analysis of the α and β factors, given
in Figs. 3. For example, Fig. 3(a) shows a closing curve
for the UK (black line) between 4000 and 5000 TCCpM
and this is in agreement with the skew-normal prediction (4753 ± 78). For the UK, with a population of
68 million people, a TCCpM of 5000 means 340 thousand confirmed people at the end of the first pandemic
wave. For Sweden (yellow line), the α factor does not
yet show a decreasing behaviour. This means that
the skew-normal forecast giving, for the TCCpM, a
value greater that 7000 (7253 ± 675) corresponding to
70 thousand confirmed cases (remembering that the
Swedish population is 10 million of inhabitants) could
represent a lower limit. As observed before, the number of total infected people is only one of the analyses
that needs to be done to assess how a country tackled
the epidemic. When looking at the skew-normal predictions for the total deaths in the UK and Sweden, we
find values around 600 (595 ± 4) and 500 (524 ± 18),
respectively. Forecasts compatible with the ones of
their β factors, see Fig. 3(b), with the Swedish value
still representing a lower limit. This means approximatively 40 and 5 thousand deaths for the UK and
Sweden, respectively.
For the USA, the skew-normal prediction for the
TCCpM leads to a value around 7500 (7618 ± 90), this
means, for a population of 330 million of people, 2.5
million of confirmed cases at the end of the first pandemic wave. What could call the attention is the
similar number of TCCpM of the USA and Sweden
(where the mitigation measures were quite different).
However, as early observed in this work, when we compare the total confirmed cases between two countries,
we have to normalise with their TpC ratio, in this

case 2/3 (see Tab. 1). Let us analyse the USA and the
UK data, where the local authorities adopted similar
strict lockdowns. The β factor of the USA (white line),
see Fig. 3(b), predicts, at the end of the first wave,
a TDpM of 400 (in terms of absolute numbers this
means 130 thousand deaths) compatible with the skewnormal prediction (377 ± 4). The UK should close its
first wave with a TDpM of 600. This difference could
be explained by the different number of BpM of the
two countries (66 for the UK and 292 for the USA).
Sweden, if the prediction is confirmed, should close
with a number of TDpM & 500 without resorting to
a strict lockdown and despite its very low number
of BpM (58). Surely a good results for the Swedish
authorities. Remember that most of the European
countries are beginning the second phase of Covid19 and, now, relaxing their mitigation measures, are
getting closer to the Swedish approach.
• Brazil.
For Brazil, it is not yet possible to model the DCCpM
and DDpM curves because the skew-normal parameters
are still in their oscillating phase. However, the α and
β factors can be used to compare the epidemic curves
of Brazil with the ones of the European countries
when they were in the same stage of the outbreak.
In particular, the Brazilian DDpM weekly spreading
curve, see Fig. 4(b), overtakes the Austrian, German,
and Portuguese ones, but it is clearly lower that the
ones of the other European countries, like Spain, Italy,
and UK.
To make some reliable predictions on Brazil, let us
examine the dynamical peak, see Fig. 9. Before reaching the peak it clearly does not make sense to speak
of asymmetric distributions, so we have to use the
standard normal distribution to get dynamical predictions. What do we mean with dynamical predictions?
The idea is simple: In the initial stage of the disease,
the daily updated data lead to forecasts that change
drastically from one day to the next. For example,
at day 65 (the 26th of Match), the prediction for the
peak of the DDpM curves for the UK, Sweden, and the
USA was at day 103 (May, 3), 109 (May, 9), and 116
(May, 116), respectively (see Fig. 9). Five days later
at day 92 (the UK and the USA) and 127 (Sweden).
In Fig. 9, the dashed red line (day of the prediction
coinciding with the prediction of the peak) represents
the critical line. When the prediction curve crosses
such a line it tends to stabilize, see the UK, Sweden,
and the USA cases. For Brazil, the oscillating peak
is getting closer to the critical line. For a symmetric
distribution, after the crossing point, we should, theoretically, have a horizontal line. So, the inclination of
the dynamical curve, after the crossing point with the
critical line, is an indication of the breaking of symmetry in the distribution. For example, the DDpM
skew-normal curves of the USA and Sweden should
have a greater asymmetry with respect to the one of
the UK. This is confirmed by the standard deviations

ΣδΛ

given in Tab. 4(b).
The dynamical analysis of the Brazil peak shows that
the country is approaching the peak of the DDpM. To
see when this will happen, let us consider the number
of deaths at the 30th of May (day 130), i.e. 28834.
If, we go back at the day 80 (April, 10), we find 1057
deaths. Let us see what happened, starting on April,
10 each 5 days:

The ratios between the number of deaths each five
days: 1.64 (1736/1057), 1.49, 1.57, 1.48, 1.32, 1.40,
1.35, 1.26, 1.24 can be modelled by using a linear fit
by
xd
.
yd = 2.4 −
100
Solving to find the xd getting to yd = 1, we find
xd = 140 .
This means a peak of the DDpM curve around the
10th of June. Looking at the increase of the last 10
days, this implies reaching the peak around 200 TDpM,
a number comparable to the one of the most critical
European countries (see Fig. 3b) but with a number
of DDpM at the peak lower than the one of these
countries (see Fig. 4b) and similar to the Dutch and
Swedish peaks. Recalling that the Netherlands are
closing the first pandemic wave around 400 and the
prediction for Sweden is around 500, for Brazil this
means around 80 thousand deaths if the mitigation
measures will remain similar to the current ones (which
are comparable to the Dutch approach). Relaxing the
mitigation rules, coming closer to the Swedish case,
will probably mean surpassing the 500 TDpM, i.e.
exceeding 100 thousand deaths.
Looking at the situation of TDpM of the five
Brazilian regions, we find (on May, 31) a very heterogeneous situation,

with the first two regions well below the national value
(140), the last two regions with a TDpM comparable to
the national one, and, finally the Northern region with
a greater value. In the São Paulo State (TDpM: 166):
São Paulo city (11.8 M) has a TDpM of 357 whereas
Campinas (1.2 M) has a TDpM of 63. This great

heterogeneity, clearly, suggests the implementation of
locally different mitigation measures when facing the
long epidemic wave.

VI. Conclusions
In this final section, after studying the Covid-19
outbreak, we begin by listing the steps we suggest to
be followed:
Step 1) The weekly spreading rate of the DCCpM
(DDpM) as the countries reached the same number of
TCCpM (TDpM) can be used to compare countries
which are in a different stage of the outbreak, what we
called α (β) factor;
Step 2) Before reaching the peak, the dynamical
(oscillatory) curve of the parameters to be fitted can
be used to understand when such a curve crosses the
critical line and tends to stabilise;
Step 3) After reaching stabilisation, asymmetrical
distributions have to be introduced to model the
DCCpM and DDpM curves (we used the skew-normal
ones).
Remembering that herd immunity and low mortality
are both fundamental keys in tackling the outbreak,
we introduce a factor that could be used to easily
compare countries. Observing that if two countries
have the same number of TCCpM, the one with an
higher number of TpC should have a lower number of
infected people in its population with respect to the
other, we introduce the following factor
ρ =

TDpM
TpC = Mortality Rate × TpC .
TCCpM

A lower value implies a better rating for the country.

using the data of Tab. 1, we find

As shown in section II, the timely massive testing
strategy of the German authorities make the great
difference between Germany and Italy. Indeed, mitigation measures (such as physical distancing, contact
tracing, restricting public gatherings, closing schools,
and university) surely become more effective when a
country adopts a timely and massive testing strategy,
avoiding that asymptomatic people contribute to transmission and helping sick people to be treated in time
before the disease gets worse. The quantitative impact

ΣδΛ

of a massive testing strategy has been studied in [29].
Clearly, if a country has not enough tests, a random
smart-testing strategy is required. By testing a much
smaller number of randomly selected people per day, it
is possible to obtain information on the local spreading
rate [30].
Let us now calculate the ρ factor for some countries
worldwide that have adopted a smart testing strategy
and reduced the number of deaths per million of inhabitants. At the end of May [2], we find

It is important to recall that the ρ factor considers
not only the mortality rate but also the immunization
rate. It is clear that with an indiscriminate and strict
lockdown, one will avoid deaths, but at the same time
one will have a very low immunization when facing the
second wave of pandemic.
The previous table is also useful to understand why
the factor TpC is important. Considering South Africa
and South Korea, we immediately see that they have
practically the same mortality rate: 12/552 and 5/224,
respectively. But the testing strategy of South Korea
led to a number of tests 4 times the one of South Africa.
Consequently, the number of infected people in South
Africa is expected to be greater that one of South
Korea by probably the same factor. This explains the
final ratio of the ρ factor between South Africa and
South Korea.

was applied on the beginning of March, we find for its

41.7) have a very low immunization rate and this should
be taken into account when facing an eventual second
wave of the pandemic. The best ρ factor, combining
mortality and immunization rate, belongs to Piemonte.
The Italian Table also shows that a smart lockdown
and an appropriate testing strategy should give better
results that an indiscriminate full lockdown.
The Brazilian mitigation measures are similar to the
Dutch approach, more strict than the Swedish one but
surely less severe than the Italian lockdown. At the
30th of May, Brazil reached 2347 TCCpM with a very
low TpC number (1.9) suggesting a great number of
hidden infected people. Nevertheless, the numbers of
deaths (TDpM: 126) still remain under control and,
as shown in section V, the peak could probably happen around June, 10. For Brazil, the ρ factor is of
0.10. This means that, at the end of the first pandemic wave, Brazil reaches a great number of confirmed cases per million (with a consequently good
immunization of the population) and a relatively low
number of deaths. As shown for Italy, it is clear that
a national strict mitigation approach is not the correct
way to face the pandemic. A smart local lockdown
has always to be preferred to a national one, as in
medieval times. In contrast to most other European
countries where people were virtually housebound, the
Brazilian, Dutch, and Swedish authorities adopted a
different mitigation approach: conservative (but not
medieval), medium, and liberal, respectively. Italy
and Netherlands are closing their first pandemic wave
with a (TDpM,TCCpM) number around (550,3800)
and (350, 2800) and Sweden, if the predictions are
correct, should close around (550,7500). The Dutch
and Swedish approaches have given positive results, in
terms of deaths and confirmed cases per million compared to the critical European countries that adopted
a strict lockdown (Belgium, Spain, the UK, and Italy),
even though they have been heavily criticised in the
beginning for their mitigation measures, and despite
their less effective testing strategies.
Scary predictions on the exponential growth rate of
the pandemic led the local authorities of many countries to use a strict lockdown to get this exponential
growth rate down to a safe level. Nevertheless, the
Swedish DCCpM curve does not confirm this fear and
it has a smooth increase with respect to the curves
of the UK and the USA (see Fig 7). Recently the
Norwegian authorities have concluded that the virus
was never spreading as fast as predicted and that the
effective reproduction rate already dropped to a value
around 1.1 before the implementation of most rigid
mitigation measures [31]. This is also happening for
Brazil, see Fig. 4a, where starting from day 80 (April,
10) and reaching day 130 (May,30), we have, each
five days, an increase between 1.30 and 1.45 of total
confirmed cases.
We conclude by observing that the study presented
in this paper only represents one of the many different

ΣδΛ

ways to look at the numbers of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Any scientific analysis has always to be complemented by the authorities looking at the local situation in
terms of ICU beds, hospital capacities and equipments.
Researchers work with numbers and surely could shed
a light on what is really happening, but nurses and
physicians struggle on a daily basis to help the population and save lives and certainly deserve protection
and all the necessary support.

Curves of the Total Confirmed Cases per Million
(TCCpM) of inhabitants for twelve European countries and the USA (a) and for all the South American countries (b) at the day 130 (May, 30). Almost
all the European countries are reaching a stabilisation point. This has not yet happened for the South
America where the outbreak is delayed with respect
to Europe. Amongst the twelve European countries analysed, the higher TCCpM numbers belong
to Spain, Ireland, and Belgium, followed by Italy
and Switzerland. The USA overtakes the European
countries with the highest TCCpM numbers, the
UK overtakes Italy, and the Sweden is found between
Switzerland and Italy.

Curves of the Total Deaths per Million (TDpM) of
inhabitants for twelve European countries and the
USA (a) and for all the South American countries
(b) at the day 130 (May, 30). Amongst the twelve
European countries analysed, the higher TDpM
numbers belong to Belgium, Spain, the UK and
Italy. The Spain anomaly is due to the lower number of deaths at the day 125 (26837) with respect to
the deaths at the day 124 (28752). These data are
reported in all the web repositories [2,11]. Amongst
the South American countries, Ecuador shows the
more critical situation followed by Peru and Brazil
with practically the same number of deaths per million and very similar curves.

Weekly spreading rate for DCCpM (α factor) and
for DDpM (β factor) calculated for twelve European
countries and the USA when the countries reach a
same TCCpM and TDpM. For the α factor, the
number of Tests per Million should be considered as
normalisation, but this number is not always available. The curves show a clear asymmetry. They
allow to predict a final TCCpM greater than 5000
for Ireland, Spain, and Belgium, around 4000 for
Italy, and UK, and around 2000 for Austria and
Germany. For total deaths, the worst result is for
Belgium (around 800), followed by Spain, UK, and
Italy (around 600). The lower mortality rate belong
to Austria and Germany.

Weekly spreading rate at the beginning for the outbreak for twelve European countries, for the USA,
and for Brazil. For the confirmed cases (a), Brazil,
with an initial behaviour similar to Sweden, shows
a steep increase in its curve overtaking most of the
European countries and the USA. For the deaths,
the Brazilian curve overtakes the ones of Austria,
Germany, and Portugal (which represent the lowest
cases of mortalities) but it is below all the other
European countries and the USA.

Dynamical curve for the peak of DDpM. The oscillatory behaviour tends to stabilise when the curve
crosses the critical (dashed red) line. After stabilisation the inclination is an indication of the breaking
of symmetry in the distribution.
