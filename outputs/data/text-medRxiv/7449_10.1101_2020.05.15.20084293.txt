RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study: We searched Pubmed on April 27th, 2020, for articles
evaluating the efficacy of interferon beta in patients infected with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), using the terms: “interferon beta and (COVID19 or SARS-CoV-2)”. We only found 5 articles. Of them, there was only one original
article in English, which was a descriptive study of a case series with solid organ
transplant from Spain.
Added value of this study: This is the first article that reports the efficacy of interferon
beta1b in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We compared the in-hospital
mortality between patients who received interferon beta1b and patients who did not.
Patients in both groups received other drugs with a potential antiviral and
immunomodulatory effect. There was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality
between both groups.
Implications of all the available evidence: In our retrospective cohort, treatment with
interferon beta1b had not impact on in-hospital survival, however it would be of clinical
interest to evaluate the effect of early administration of this drug in the control of SARSCoV-2 infection in larger randomized clinical trials.

ABSTRACT
Background
COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with significant mortality and has no approved
antiviral therapy. Interferon beta1 has shown in vitro studies a potent inhibition of SARSCoV and MERS-CoV. In an in vitro study, SARS-CoV-2 had more sensitivity to IFN-I
pretreatment that SARS-CoV. A combination of IFN beta1b administered subcutaneously
with other antiviral treatments has been recommended in several guidelines. However,
clinical trial results for the treatment of COVID-19 are pending. We aimed to assess the
efficiency of IFN beta1b in COVID19 comparing the in-hospital mortality between
patients who received IFN beta1b and patients did not receive.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we included hospitalized adults with COVID-19
between February 23th and April 4th, 2020, at the Central Defense Hospital (Madrid,
Spain). Subcutaneous interferon beta-1b was recommended in moderate-severe
pneumonia. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate
analysis was performed to identify variables associated with in-hospital mortality.
Findings
We analyzed 256 patients (106 patients in interferon group and 150 patients in control
group). At admission, patients who did not receive interferon beta1b presented a greater
number of comorbidities. The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63/256). Twenty-two
patients (20.8%) in the interferon group died and 41 (27.3%) in the control group
(p=0.229). In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age,
severity of clinical picture at admission and hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Interpretation
In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, interferon beta1b treatment was not associated
to decrease in-hospital mortality. Further assessment of the earlier administration of this
drug in randomized trials is recommended.

INTRODUCTION
A new respiratory disease was reported to the WHO China Country Office on 31
December 2019 (1). A cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology had been
detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, causing severe respiratory illness
similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU
admission and high mortality in some cases (2). A new type of coronavirus (named lately
SARS-CoV-2), was isolated on 7 January 2020 (3). On January 30th, 2020, WHO
declared the outbreak of nCoV-2019 as a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC) (4). From the initial description, the disease has spread around the
world becoming a pandemic threat, and has affected not only health, but economic and
social affairs. By April 27th, 2020, there were more than 2.5M total confirmed cases and
more than180000 deaths, in 213 countries (5).
Initial descriptions reported flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, dysnea, headache,
myalgias and asthenia. Digestive complains were also reported including nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. With spreading of the disease, there here have been described new
clinical features of the disease, such as neurological, myocardial, ophtalmic, cutaneous or
thrombotic events. When coronavirus invades the host, a complex intracellular
mechanism is activated, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) is promoted. SARSCoV-2 penetrates alveolar cell (pneumocytes type II) using the receptor for angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), a membrane exopeptidase. Activating the downstream
JAK STAT signal-pathway, IFNs limit virus spread, and play an immunomodulatory role
through macrophage, NK cells and T/B cells. Blocking the production of IFNs allows
virus to survive (6). On the other hand, coronavirus infection activates the immune system
generating an excessive response that could lead to greater lung injury and worse clinical
evolution. However, this hyperactivation is insufficient to control the infection and leads

to further tissue damage, being able to develop the Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS); the latter has been described as the main cause of mortality from COVID-19.
Excessive activation of the innate immune system also causes damage to the
microvascular system and activates the coagulation system and inhibition of fibrinolysis,
causing sepsis-induced coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation, with
widespread microcirculatory disorders leading to the development of multi-organ failure.
Recommendations about treatment, initially based on antiviral drugs, are now considering
immunomodulation as a key stone but not the only one. Several different treatments have
been used for COVID-19, including lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, hydroxicloroquine,
tocilizumab, baricitinib, immunoglobulin and corticoids with no or conflicting results. No
approved treatment is currently available, but there are therapeutic strategies in SARS
and MERS-CoV disease on clinical or preclinical research that would suggest interferon
as pillar tool in COVID-19.
Antiviral effect of interferon has been described in other positive single-stranded RNA
virus diseases such as HCV. Antiviral activity is based on the activation of RNase that
breaks-down the nucleic acid chain of the virus. In addition, it blocks the translation of
RNA, prevents encapsidation and viral release (7). There are in vitro tests showing
activity against MERS-CoV (8) and studies on animal models had promising results (9),
but studies to evaluate clinical efficacy had variable outcomes (10 11 12 13).
The aim of this study is to assess the effectivity and safety of interferon beta1b in the
treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.

METHODS
Study design and participants
This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. We enrolled all hospitalized adults
(aged ≥16 years) at the Central Defense Hospital “Gómez Ulla” (Madrid, Spain) with
COVID-19 and had a definitive outcome (dead or discharge) between February 23th and
April 4th. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined according to Spanish Ministry of Health
definitions on March 19th, 2020. COVID19 case including confirmed cases by reversetranscriptase–polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 in a
respiratory tract sample and probable cases (bilateral interstitial pneumonia with clinical
picture compatible with a COVID-19 diagnosis with no laboratory tests or nonconcluding SARS-CoV-2 test). No exclusion criteria were applied at this stage.
Data collection
Demographical data, comorbidities, treatments prescribed for COVID-19, clinical
severity at admission and analytical parameters at admission were extracted from the
electronic medical records by two physicians and entered into a database. In case of
differences of interpretation a third investigator checked the medical records and
adjudicated any difference.
Definitions
Severity of clinical picture at admission was defined according to Ministry of Health of
Spain medical treatment protocol, March 19th, 2020: mild (SpO2 in rest above 93%),
moderate (need for supplemental oxygen with fraction of inspired oxygen less than 50%),
severe (who required mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen of at
least 50% or more).

cognitive capabilities.
Procedures
Interferon beta1b (Betaferon®) was given by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 250 μg
on alternate days. Patients included in the interferon group had received at least one dose.
Local treatment protocol recommended interferon beta1b in the hospitalized patients with
moderate-severe pneumonia, with a duration between 3-5 doses. The number of doses
was at the discretion of the clinician according to the evolution of the patient and
tolerance. Patients in both groups were treated with other specific drugs with potential
activity against SARS-CoV-2 and/or COVID-19 immune disorders leading to ARDS.
These drugs could include antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir, and/or hydroxychloroquine or
chloroquine), and/or anti-inflammatory drugs (steroids and/or tocilizumab). Antibiotics
were scheduled only in the case of suspected bacterial infection.
In addition to regular clinical monitoring, renal function, liver enzymes, and blood count
were assessed at baseline and closely throughout the treatment course at the discretion of
the clinician. Chest radiographs were also done for all inpatients.

Outcomes
The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality in two different regimens: with and
without interferon beta1b.
Statistical methods
Simple characteristics were described using absolute and relative frequencies for
categorical variables and means ±SD or median (IQR) for continuous variables. Chisquare test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test were used to compare continuous
baseline variables. Comparisons of categorical variables between groups were conducted
using the Pearson’s chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.
Univariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with mortality. The
variables evaluated were: age, sex, presence of comorbidities (hypertension,
dyslipidemia, diabetes, lung disease, heart disease, cancer, dementia), number of
comorbidities, clinical severity at admission (mild, moderate, severe), laboratory
parameters at admission and use of other treatments. Age and laboratory parameters were
categorized in according to the ROC curves of each parameter: age (<65 vs. ≥65 years),
lymphocytes (<1000 cls./uL vs. ≥1000 cls./uL), C-reactive protein (<14 mg/dl vs. ≥14
mg/dl), D-dimer (<1000 ng/mL vs. ≥1000 ng/mL), ferritin (<1000 ng./mL vs. ≥1000
ng./mL), lactate dehydrogenase (<400U/L vs. ≥400 U/L). A multivariate logistic
regression of variables with significance in univariate analysis of p<0,1 was performed.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25 statistical package. All tests
were 2-sided, p values <0.05 were considered significant.

Ethics approvals
From beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, eligible hospitalized patients were offered
treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta1b after informed verbal consent was
obtained from the patients themselves or their closest relative. The research protocol was
approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Investigation of the Ministry of Defense
of Spain (code 25/20).
Role of funding source
No external funding was received for this study.
RESULTS
A total of 256 patients with COVID19 were admitted in our hospital, and died or have
been discharged between February 23th and April 4th. Most patients were male (59.4%)
with mean age of 63.7 years. The most frequent comorbidity was hypertension (44.5%),
followed by dyslipemia and cardiopathy (Table 1). Overall patients included, 61.2%
presented at least two comorbidities. Median time from illness onset to hospital admission
was 7 days (IQR 3-9). At admission, 46.3% of patients had a mild clinical picture, 36.1%
moderate and 17.6% severe. At hospital discharge, 89.5% of patients has been diagnosed
with pneumonia. Most of the patients in our cohort received hydroxychloroquine (77%),
followed by azythromycin (62.9%), interferon beta1b (41.4%), lopinavir/ritonavir
(36.1%), and corticosteroids (25.8%).
Of all the patients of our cohort, 106 were treated with interferon beta1b. No significant
differences were observed upon comparing the two groups in demographics variables,
comorbidities, severity clinical at admission and level of biomarkers at admission. There
was more percentage of patients with at least 2 comorbidities in the group not receiving
interferon (46.3% vs. 34.9%, p=0.069) (Table 1).

In the interferon group, more patients received hydroxychloroquine (95.3% vs. 64%,
p<0.001) and lopinavir/ritonavir (44.3% vs. 30.2%, p=0.021). There was no difference in
in-hospital mortality between the group receiving the combination of interferon beta1b
and lopinavir/ritonavir versus the group of patients receiving interferon beta1b without
lopinavir/ritonavir (p=0.906)
Outcome
The overall mortality rate was 24.6% (63/256). Twenty-two patients (20.8%) receiving
interferon beta1b died and 41 (27.3%) patients not receiving interferon bea1b (p=0.229).
Mortality risk factors
In the multivariate analysis age (older than 65 years old), clinical severity at admission,
and not have received hydroxychloroquine were significantly associated with in-hospital
mortality (Table 2). The interferon treatment was not associated with survival benefit
neither univariate analysis nor multivariate analysis.
DISCUSSION
Three human coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) cause severe
pneumonia.

Rapid virus replication reaching high titers and associated enhanced

inflammatory responses, are believed to contribute to pathogenicity (14 15 16). Type 1
IFNs generally protect mammalian hosts from virus infections, but in some cases, IFN-I
is pathogenic. In MERS-CoV–infected mice, IFN-I administration within 1 day after
infection protected mice from lethal infection. In contrast, delayed IFN-β treatment failed
to inhibit virus replication and enhanced proinflammatory cytokine expression, resulting
in fatal pneumonia (17). In that way, it seems that the timing of IFN-I administration is a
crucial factor in the effectiveness of the treatment. In an in vitro study, the IFN-I
pretreatment resulted in a significant reduction in viral replication in Vero E6 cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 in compared to control untreated cells (18).

In our cohort, the median time from the start of symptoms to hospital admission was 7
days in both groups. We do not know if earlier administration would have changed the
results of our study. In recently published clinical trial in severe COVID-19,
lopinavir/ritonavir treatment within 12 days after the onset of symptoms was associated
with shorter time to clinical improvement but later it was not (19).
In our cohort, in-hospital mortality in patients not receiving interferon beta1b was higher
than in the interferon group, although the difference was not significant. Most patients in
both treatment groups were receiving other potentially effective drugs, as
hydroxychloroquine or azytromycin, making it difficult to demonstrate efficacy of a
treatment individually in a retrospective analysis. Results from in vitro and animal studies
suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1b may be effective
against MERS-CoV. A randomized controlled trial is ongoing to evaluate this
combination as a potential treatment for MERS (MIRACLE trial) (20). To explore the
efficacy of this combination in SARS-CoV-2, we compare in-hospital mortality between
patients receiving interferon beta1b with and without lopinavir/ritonavir and
no difference in in-hospital mortality was found.
There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between two groups,
including the clinical severity of pneumonia on admission. On admission, almost half of
the patients presented mild pneumonia in both groups (interferon and control). In fact,
45% of patients who received interferon beta1b during hospitalization presented mild
pneumonia on admission. Although treatment with interferon was indicated in moderatesevere pneumonia, there was a shortage of the drug, so not all patients could receive
treatment despite being indicated. In this context, interferon beta1b treatment was
prioritized based on life expectancy prior to admission. This explains why there were

more patients with dementia and other comorbidities in patients not receiving interferon
beta1b.
In the multivariate analysis, the predictors of in-hospital mortality were age, severity of
pneumonia on admission, and treatment with hydroxychloroquine. The survival benefit
found with hydroxychloroquine treatment supports the findings of a previous study of our
research group in this sense (under per review). In addition, severity clinical on admission
as predictor of mortality is a finding reported in MERS. So, Mohammed Al Ghamdi et al.
found in a retrospective cohort study that patients receiving beta interferon and mofetil
had improved survival, however this was confounded by the severity of illness on
presentation for beta interferon (21).
Our study has the limitations of a retrospective study, selection and unmeasured
confounding bias cannot be completely excluded. It would have been ideal to have had
microbiological confirmation of all the patients, but since this study had been carried out
in the worst phase of the epidemic in our country, at specific times and due to lack of
tests, microbiological confirmation was not necessary in cases of high clinical and
radiological suspicion without any other alternative cause. Furthermore, we cannot
evaluate differences between the two groups in terms of virus elimination, as there was
no RT-PCR monitoring for all patients.
This study is, to the best our knowledge, the first clinical study that evaluates the
effectiveness of the interferon beta1b in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Conclusion
In our retrospective cohort, the interferon beta1b treatment had no significant impact on
in-hospital survival. We consider that it would be of interest to explore the efficacy of the
early administration of this drug in controlled clinical trials, with a larger sample size.
