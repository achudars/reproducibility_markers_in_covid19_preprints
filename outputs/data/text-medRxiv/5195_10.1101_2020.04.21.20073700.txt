Abstract
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease or hypertension have a
high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Long-term exposure to air pollution,
especially PM2.5, has also been associated with COVID-19 mortality. We collated individual-level
data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We
fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the
outcome, and long-term average levels of air pollutants as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted
using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan
before the travel ban and movements within each city during the time of emergency response.
Other variables included census, smoking prevalence, climate, and socio-economic data from 324
cities in China. We adjusted for human mobility and socio-economic factors, and found that an
increase in long-term NO2 or PM2.5 may correspond to an increase in the number of COVID-19
cases and severe infections. However, the linkage might also be affected by the confounding factor
of population size because of the predefined correlation between population size and air pollution.
The results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and
epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings of this paper (and other previous studies
that have given ambiguous results) indicate that a more definitive analysis is needed of the link
between COVID-19 and air pollution.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the world 1-4. As more
countries have passed the (first) peak of the COVID-19 epidemic, country-based strategies have
shifted from containment to delay and mitigation, aiming to prevent a second epidemic curve or
lower its peak 5. The virus (SARS-CoV-2) induces respiratory stress, so individuals with a
compromised respiratory system are expected to be more vulnerable to infection 6, and people
with pre-existing conditions are more vulnerable to severe infection. Meta-analysis has shown that
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and hypertension
are associated with severe COVID-19 infection and admission to intensive care units (ICUs) 7.
Long-term exposure to air pollution affects lung function and is associated with increased
prevalence of COPD, cardiovascular disease and hypertension 8-10. However, it is not known
whether vulnerability to lung diseases can affect COVID-19 risk 11. We need to understand the
impact of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 infection and disease severity. This could help to
improve future modelling and disease burden calculations around the world.
During the first wave of COVID-19 in China, to prevent further dissemination of the illness,
Wuhan prohibited all transport in and out of the city on 23 January 2020. In the following days,
cities across mainland China activated the highest level of emergency response and contained
outbreaks outside Wuhan up until 6 March 2020. These measures substantially reduced air
pollution: a significant reduction in pollution level was observed across cities in China between
January and March 2020 12,13. Data on cities (excluding Wuhan) are ideal to assess the relationship
between long-term average exposure and COVID-19 risk (Figure 1) because the cities had widely
distributed COVID-19 cases, highly variable historical air quality, and have been surveyed
comprehensively under consistent criteria and data standards across the country. Air pollution has
both acute and long-term health effects, so air pollution reduction serves as a natural experiment to
offset the potential acute effects in particular.
Methods
Epidemiological, demographic and geographical data
We collected epidemiological data from the official reports of the health commissions of 324 cities,
excluding Wuhan. These included daily reports from 31 December 2019 to 6 March 2020, but
excluded newly-reported locally-acquired infections. Data on the percentage of severe COVID-19
cases were obtained from official reports of Provincial Health Committees. The age structure for
each city was obtained from the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of
China. Socio-economic data, including the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2016, were
obtained from China City Statistical Yearbook.
Human mobility data
Human movements were tracked using mobile phone data from Baidu location-based services
(LBS) and telecommunications operators. The number of recorded movements from Wuhan city to
other cities across China was calculated from 11 to 23 January 2020. On 23 January, movement
from Wuhan reached almost zero because of the travel ban. Travel movements within each city
were recorded until 6 March.

Data for air pollution
Original daily data for particulate matter concentrations, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2,
and O3 for each city were obtained from air quality stations across China from January 2015 to
March 2020. For each city, the average concentration for each pollutant before the COVID-19
outbreak (January 2020) was calculated across the whole period available.
Statistical methods
To quantify the effect of air pollution on COVID-19 risk, we used the historical data for air quality
between 2015 and 2019 and COVID-19 case reports. Socio-demographic and behavioural
confounders were identified through the literature search. The association between long-term
exposure to air pollutants and COVID-19 risk was assessed by regression with a generalized linear
model (GLM):

where Flowi is the passenger volume from Wuhan to city i during the Spring Festival 2020, before
the Wuhan travel ban, and Peak time of flow reflects the corresponding peak time. Within-city
movementsi shows the effect of social distancing, such as suspending intra-city public transport,
closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings, and was measured by daily human
mobility within a city between the travel ban and 6 March 2020 of city i. These data were obtained
from the Baidu location-based service. GDP is the gross domestic product per capita of city i.
Smoking prevalence and second-hand smoking prevalence in non-smokers were obtained from the
Chinese National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHS) 14,15. The proportion of residents older
than 65, population and population density of city i were extracted from census data. Climate
conditions were shown by temperature and rainfall in summer and winter. Latitude and longitude
show the spatial distribution of city i. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 show daily average
concentration data of air pollutants of city i between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019. Air
pollution variables were included in the model separately because of the high multicollinearity
among them. βs are regression coefficients. The analysis used the R software (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, version 3.6.3), MASS package.
Sensitivity analysis

models omitting adjusted variables, separately. We then treated NO2 and PM2.5 as a categorical
variable (categorized at empirical quintiles), then used air pollutant concentrations in winter and
non-winter to replace the annual average. Finally, cities were categorized by population size into
three separate groups, small (0–2.68 million population, n = 98), medium-sized (2.68–4.67 million,
n = 97), and large (4.67–30.75 million, n = 98).
Results
Analysis of COVID-19 in China
We used a well-tested research data platform that gathers nationwide human mobility, census, air
pollution and socio-economic data, and data on smoking from a nationwide survey 16. The records
we used consisted of reported COVID-19 cases for 324 cities (except Wuhan city) in mainland
China between 31 December 2019 and 6 March 2020 (excluding newly-reported locally-acquired
infections), mobile data of recorded movements (data provided by Baidu location-based services
and telecommunications operators in China), census data (population, population density, and
percentage of the population over 65 years old), smoking prevalence and second-hand smoking
prevalence in non-smokers, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, climate condition
(temperature and rainfall), and six major air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2,
and O3). We analysed and quantified the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution
and COVID-19 risk.
Between 31 December 2019 and 6 March 2020, 81,132 cases of COVID-19 were reported across
China. Of these, 62.6% (50783/81132) of cases were clustered in Wuhan city, and the remaining
37.4% (30349/81132) cases were distributed across 324 other cities. After 6 March 2020, there
were very few locally-acquired infections outside Wuhan city in the first wave. There was
sustained local transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan city, so data from there were not included in
the subsequent analysis.
COPD, CVD and hypertension are associated with high risk of COVID-19 severity. We therefore
suspected that long-term exposure to air pollutants, which increases lung damage, would be
associated with increased vulnerability to COVID-19. To test this hypothesis, socio-demographic
and behavioural confounders were identified through a literature search. We first investigated the
effect of travel movements from Wuhan city, the location where COVID-19 was first recorded,
and from where it spread across China. In 2020, during travel for the Spring Festival holiday,
approximately 4.3 million people travelled out of Wuhan to other cities in China 16. This travel is
strongly associated with the total number of cases reported from each city (rho = 0.81, P < 0.01),
suggesting the outbreaks across China were mainly seeded from Wuhan city.
Air pollution reduction and travel restrictions
On 23 January 2020, in an attempt to contain the epidemic, non-essential travel was prohibited in
and out of Wuhan city, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million people. Since then, the
whole of China has implemented the highest level of emergency response to reinforce the
containment of COVID-19. Interventions included the closure of entertainment venues, the
suspension of within-city public transport, and prohibition of travel to and from other cities across
China. Our results indicate that these measures have significantly reduced the movement within

cities compared with 2019 (Figure 2). The average air quality also significantly improved,
compared with the same period in 2019. The changes in average daily PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO 2,
and O3 were −7.02%, −19.25%, −15.06%, −5.46%, −20.17% and 5.01% from 31 December to 6
March (Figure 2).
The effect of long-term exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 on COVID-19 cases and severe infections
We also collected data on a range of confounding variables such as gross domestic product per
capita, smoking prevalence, climate, and age composition (age > 65), together with travel
movements from Wuhan and within-city movements (as a measure of social distancing). These
were used as control variables in the statistical analysis. The population size of each city was not
included in the model because of high multicollinearity with travel movements from Wuhan (rho =
0.71, P < 0.01). The three billion Spring Festival holiday trips also induced uncoordinated changes
in actual population size across cities 17. As expected, the number of COVID-19 cases in each city
increased with passenger flow from Wuhan. More infections were reported in cities that had more
travellers from Wuhan. Overall, we observed positive and significant associations between both
reported and severe cases of COVID-19 with historical air pollutant concentration (Figure 3). In
324 cities (except Wuhan) that had data on air quality, an increase of 10 μg/m3 in NO2 or PM2.5
concentration was associated with 22.41% (95% CI: 7.28%–39.89%) or 15.35% (95% CI:
5.60%–25.98%) increase in COVID-19 cases. We also examined the relationship between the
number of severe COVID-19 cases and air pollutants. An increase of 10 μg/m3 in NO2 or PM2.5
concentration was associated with a 19.20% (95% CI: 4.03%–36.59%) or 9.61% (95% CI:
0.12%–20.01%) increase in severe COVID-19 cases. The results are statistically significant and
robust to sensitivity analyses (Tables 1–3). The analysis was also carried out for separate datasets.
Cities were categorized by population size into small, medium, and large. There was a positive but
not significant association between the number of confirmed cases and NO2 or PM2.5
concentration in each group (Figure 3). The results might still be affected by population size,
however, because air pollution is usually the result of population growth, so there is a predefined
correlation between air pollutant concentration and population size.
Discussion
Several studies have evaluated the association between air pollution exposure and COVID-19 risk.
Our finding is in line with studies based on large-scale nationwide data, including in the US 18,
UK 19,20, Italy 21,22, The Netherlands 23, Spain, France and Germany 24, and provinces of China 25.
However, the size of the study and that the first wave has been contained in China, meant that we
were able to investigate the impact of historical air pollution on COVID-19 risk and severity. Our
results also highlighted the importance of air quality improvements to health in China.
Our findings are consistent with previous results that exposure to air pollutants is associated with
poorer lung function, often measured by forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1
second 26-29. Particulate matter (PM) is associated with increased risk of cardiopulmonary diseases
30

, aggravated case fatality of severe acute respiratory syndrome (caused by another type of
coronavirus) 31 and could impair the immune response 32. Oxidant pollutants could also damage
the immune function and affect the ability of the lungs to clear the virus 6. Nitrogen oxides (NOX)
can cause inflammatory responses and have a direct effect on the risk of respiratory diseases 33,34

(also shown in Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, http://ctdbase.org). Nitrogen oxide is
primarily produced by traffic and factories, and less influenced by climate condition, so there were
reductions in both the concentration of nitrogen oxides and within-city movements during the
COVID-19 outbreak in cities of China. Increased ozone or sulphur dioxide concentrations were
associated with lower COVID-19 risk, which is also consistent with previous studies 19,25.
However, the mechanisms underlying the impact on COVID-19 risk remain unknown.
Several important caveats are worth mentioning. First, the data included here were all from
mainland China. It is therefore not clear whether the findings can be generalized to other countries
without data on historic air pollution exposure. Second, there are currently no high-quality records
at city level of severe COVID-19 infections and ICU admissions, although we have attempted to
fill the gap by using province-level reports. Finally, we do not know the exact number of cases
because of the number of asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases that may not be recorded.
These data will not be available until there has been a systematic survey of infection (e.g. by
serological testing) across China. However, we have reported a national-level disease pattern
covering 324 cities and its potential association with long-term exposure to air pollutants.
In conclusion, our results, combined with recent reports from elsewhere, suggest a potential
association between air quality and population vulnerability to COVID-19. Interventions to
contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China successfully reduced air pollution levels and potentially
prevented acute respiratory disease. The findings of this paper (and other previous studies that
have given ambiguous results) indicate that a more definitive analysis is needed of the link
between COVID-19 and air pollution.

Figure 1. Air pollution exposure, COVID-19, and travel movements in 324 cities of China during
Spring Festival 2020. (A) Distribution of cities with data on NO2 and COVID-19. The shading
from light red to dark red represents the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in
each city from low to high, from 31 December 2019 to 6 March 2020. Points coloured from blue
to red represent the historic mean annual NO2 concentration (µg/m3) from low to high, during
January 2015 and December 2019, before the COVID epidemic. (B) Association between the
cumulative number of confirmed cases, the number of human movements from Wuhan to each
city, and historic mean annual NO2 concentration. The area of circles represents the cumulative
number of cases reported by 6 March 2020.

Figure 3. Variation per unit and 95% confidence intervals, (A) NO2 and (B) PM2.5. The
variation per unit (VPU) = [exp(variable coefficient) – 1] ×100%. VPU can be interpreted as
percentage increase in the number of COVID-19 cases associated with a 10 μg/m3 increase in
long-term average NO2 and PM2.5. The VPU from the main analysis was adjusted by confounding
factors (inward movement from Wuhan city before travel ban and peak time of movement,
within-city movements, GDP, smoking prevalence, second-hand smoking prevalence in
non-smokers, percent of the population > 65 years old, population, population density, climate,
and spatial distribution). In the sensitivity analyses, we omitted each confounding factor separately,
and used seasonal air pollutant concentrations.
