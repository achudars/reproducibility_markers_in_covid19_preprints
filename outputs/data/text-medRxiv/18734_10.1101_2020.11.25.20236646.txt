Abstract
Background
The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has increased the burden on healthcare systems already
strained by a high incidence of tuberculosis (TB) as co-infection and dual presentation are occurring
in syndemic settings. We aimed to understand the interaction between these diseases by profiling
COVID-19 gene expression signatures on RNA-sequencing data from TB-infected individuals.
Methods
We performed a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis by querying PubMed and pre-print
servers to derive eligible COVID-19 gene expression signatures from human whole blood (WB),
PBMCs or BALF studies. A WB influenza dataset served as a control respiratory disease signature.
Three large TB RNA-seq datasets, comprising multiple cohorts from the UK and Africa and
consisting of TB patients across the disease spectrum, were chosen to profile these
signatures. Putative “COVID-19 risk scores” were generated for each sample in the TB datasets using
the TBSignatureProfiler package. Risk was stratified by time to TB diagnosis in progressors and
contacts of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. An integrative analysis between TB and COVID-19
single-cell RNA-seq data was performed and a population-level meta-analysis was conducted to
identify shared gene ontologies between the diseases and their relative enrichment in COVID-19
disease severity states.
Results
35 COVID-19 gene signatures from nine eligible studies comprising 98 samples were profiled on
TB RNA-seq data from 1181 samples from 853 individuals. 25 signatures had significantly higher
COVID-19 risk in active TB (ATB) compared with latent TB infection (p <0·005), 13 of which were
validated in two independent datasets. FCN1- and SPP1-expressing macrophages enriched in BALF
during severe COVID-19 were identified in circulation during ATB. Shared perturbed ontologies
included antigen presentation, epigenetic regulation, platelet activation, and ROS/RNS production
were enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity. Finally, we demonstrate that the overlapping
transcriptional responses may complicate development of blood-based diagnostic signatures of coinfection.
Interpretation
Our results identify shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB as a dual risk
posed by co-infection to COVID-19 severity and TB disease progression. These individuals should be
followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.

Background
Three months after it was first detected, SARS-CoV-2 was declared to have caused the first global
pandemic of the 21st Century. In the absence of an effective treatment or vaccine, mortality in the 35
million diagnosed thus far, currently stands at 2.9% (as of October 2020). By comparison
tuberculosis (TB), a similar respiratory infection and humanity’s longest continuing pandemic, causes
10 million annual cases, and has a mortality of 12–20%, the upper bound including those HIVcoinfected1. This high mortality, of roughly 4000 people a day, exists despite a vaccine that reduces
infant mortality and antibiotics which have reduced mortality from the pre-antibiotic era by 50%.
With an estimated quarter of the world’s population infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
it could be said that TB is a silent killer. Silent in that during the current pandemic, TB has killed
roughly the same number of people a day as COVID-19 currently; with the socio-economic and
health systems impact of COVD-19 lockdowns estimated to result in an additional 6.8 million TB
cases and 1.4 million TB deaths over the next 5 years2,3. Countries where TB-HIV already causes high
mortality were shielded from previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, and thus the interaction of these
coronaviruses with concurrent TB co-infection, has not previously been experienced.
COVID-19 and TB share a symptomatic presentation of productive cough, fever and shortness of
breath, and clinical parameters of raised C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), D-Dimer, interleukin (IL)-6, leukopenia and neutrophilia. The similarity in clinical parameters
and aspects of underlying immunological reactions suggests co-infection will not only complicate
diagnostic algorithms, it indicates a potentially fatal convergence in immunopathogenesis. Emerging
case studies and population level data indicate TB patients, and those latently infected or with a
history of TB are at increased risk of severe COVID-194-7.
In order to develop contextually appropriate treatment and risk mitigation interventions in
communities where the potential for Mtb-SARS-CoV-2 co-infection is high, we urgently need to
understand how the immunopathogenesis of these two respiratory pathogens interact. We therefore
conducted a systematic transcriptomic evaluation of whole blood (WB), peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) signatures associated with
COVID-19 clinical severity and the spectrum of asymptomatic and symptomatic TB. Our findings
suggest that subclinical and active TB (ATB) increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease, due to
increased abundance of circulating myeloid subpopulations also found in the lungs of severe COVID19 patients. This shared pathway of immunopathogenesis also suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection
will trigger increased progression to TB disease. COVID-19 may therefore pose the biggest threat to
ending the TB epidemic since HIV-1 and the modelling increase of 6.8 million extra TB cases in the
next 5 years is significantly underestimated8.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
The hypothesis that WB transcriptomic signatures present in those with existing TB infection will
increase risk of severe COVID-19 and interfere in diagnostic biomarker selection was evaluated using
a combination of transcriptomic data from COVID-19 patients and WB RNA-seq data from studies of
TB disease progression on which the COVID-19 signatures were evaluated. A literature search of
published and pre-print manuscripts was conducted on the NIH PubMed and bioRxiv, medRxiv, and
SSRN servers uploaded/published between 01/02/20 and 20/09/20 (figure 1). The WB influenza
dataset, GSE1113689, was used to generate an influenza virus control signature. The curatedTBData
package,10 which includes 48 publicly available TB RNA-seq datasets, was used to identify eligible
TB datasets, that included individuals who progressed to TB during the duration of study follow-up,
with RNA-seq data at baseline and time of diagnosis, and patient-level meta-data including time to
TB progression. Selection criteria and cohort datasets are described in detail in appendix 1 p2 and p5
(table 1–2).

Data Analysis
TB RNA-seq data were downloaded for eligible studies using the curatedTBData package,10 as
outlined in appendix 1 p2. Samples collected at all time points were included. The eligible COVID-19
and influenza control signatures (appendix 2 p1) were evaluated independently against the patientlevel TB RNA-seq data, generating individual-sample putative “COVID-19 risk score” using gene set
variation analysis (GSVA)11 with the TBSignatureProfiler package12 (appendix 1 p2), and score
significance, as compared to latent TB infection (LTBI) controls, calculated by Bonferroni-corrected
t-test (appendix 2 p2–4).

Single cell (sc)RNA-seq integrative comparison was conducted using the identified COVID-19
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) dataset13 downloaded from the NIH GEO database
(GSE145926) and a TB PBMC dataset14 downloaded from NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA,
SRR11038989-SRR11038995). filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5 files were read into RStudio using the
Seurat Read10X_h5 function (v3.0).15 Datasets were independently normalised before the Seurat
FindIntegrationAnchors function was applied to generate a corrected data matrix for joint analysis.
Functional enrichment analysis and cohort selection is described in detail in appendix 1 (p3). Briefly,
selected datasets were evaluated using the Metascape16 statistically enriched ontology terms,
generating enriched pathways (appendix 1 p3–4). Pathway-associated gene clusters from the
functional enrichment analysis were used to generate a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and
visualised with Cytoscape17 (v4.01) using ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)18.

Results

COVID-19 severity signatures are enriched during subclinical and active tuberculosis
Nine COVID-19 studies with 35 signatures were eligible for evaluation (figure 1, table 1). Three TB
cohort studies encompassing 853 individuals and 1181 samples, at various time points, were eligible
for comparison. COVD-19 signatures were first evaluated in the TB combined observational and
prospective cohort (TCC), from the UK (London and Leicester) and South Africa, including 293
individuals19. Out of the 35 COVID-19 signatures profiled, 25 were significantly associated (p<0·005)
with higher COVID-19 risk scores in TB progressors and ATB patients, compared with latently
infected individuals. Conversely, the influenza signature centred on a score of zero, across the
spectrum of TB infection in both countries (figure 2). Of the ten COVID-19 signatures that were not
associated with a significantly higher COVID-19 risk score, across the TB spectrum, seven were
enriched in those with mild COVID-19 in the original studies compared to severe COVID-19 patients.
Of the 20 scRNA-seq immune cell population signatures profiled; innate immune cell signatures
generated the highest COVID-19 risk scores in the ATB groups. The classical monocyte signature20
was drastically increased in ICU cases of COVID-19, yielding the most significantly increased risk
scores between LTBI and ATB samples (p<0·0001). The Silvin et al. COVID-19 WB neutrophil
signature21 was most significantly increased in ATB vs LTBI (p<0·0001). The lung macrophage subpopulations associated with severe disease in BALF from COVID-19 patients13 showed high risk
scores; in particular, the FCN1hi (monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), G1), FCNloSPP1hi (prefibrotic macrophages, G2), and intermediary G1/2 macrophages. Conversely, the majority of adaptive
immune cell signatures (CD4 and CD8 T cells) were higher in LTBI and TB contacts who didn’t
progress to TB (figure 2). In general, T cell populations are depleted during severe COVID-19
infection13,20,22 and a lower COVID-19 risk scores for these signatures in the active and progressive
TB patients could reflect a similar depletion of these populations. In the Wei et al. study of patients
recovering from COVID-1920, the monocyte signature was associated with the early recovery stage
indicating persistence of hyperinflammatory response, whereas the NK cell, T cell and B cell
signatures were enriched in the late recovery stage, explaining the low COVID-19 risk scores
associated with these signatures in ATB cases.
The mild/moderate and severe COVID-19 WB signatures23 (figure 2, Hadjadj et al.) showed
significant differences in COVID-19 risk scores between ATB and LTBI (p<0·00001 and p<0·005,
respectively) while the critical signature generated a low COVID-19 risk score which was
significantly higher in the Leicester ATB cases than the LTBI cases (p<0·0001). COVID-19 disease
severity blood transcriptional module (BTM) signatures24 included genes involved in IFN responses
and antigen processing and presentation and clearly separated active disease samples from LTBI and
QFT-negative TB contact samples (P<0·0001).

Assessing COVID-19 risk scores after further stratifying the Leicester TB contacts and ATB index
cases by the location of index case TB (pulmonary [PTB] or extrapulmonary [EPTB]) revealed higher
COVID-19 risk scores in contacts of PTB and PTB patients than those of EPTB, respectively
(appendix 1 p6).

COVID-19 signatures separate latent tuberculosis cases from those who progress to active
disease by COVID-19 risk score
Thirteen signatures having significantly higher COVID-19 risk score (with an associated adjusted
p<0·005) in at least two ATB groups, compared with LTBI, were selected for validation in the
additional two TB progressor RNA-seq datasets: the ACS25 and GC6 cohorts including 153 and 407
individuals, respectively.26 Both datasets exhibited the same trend of increased COVID-19 risk score
for all 13 signatures in progressors compared with LTBI (p≤0·01), whilst scoring zero for the
influenza signature. The COVID-19 IFN signatures23,27,28 were associated with the greatest difference
in COVID-19 risk score between LTBI and progressor groups, p<0·001 for both datasets). Plotting by
days to TB diagnosis revealed an additional trend of higher risk of severe COVID-19 associated with
proximity to ATB disease in the ACS cohort (figure 3A), but not the GC6 cohort (figure 3B).

High concordance between monocyte subpopulations identified in BALF of severe COVID-19
patients and those in circulation during active TB disease
Reported similarities between BALF and WB scRNA-seq expression profiles observed in COVID-19
patients led us to investigate whether the BALF macrophage sub-lineages13 that associated with
COVID-19 risk in ATB patients (figure 2) could be detected in circulation during TB infection. An
integrated scRNA-seq analysis was performed using publicly available TB scRNA-seq PBMC data,
consisting of both active and LTBI samples with BALF scRNA-seq data13, from COVID-19 patients
of varying disease severity (appendix 1 p7). A high concordance was observed between the immune
cell populations present within ATB PBMC and severe COVID-19 BALF after tSNE dimensionality
reduction (figure 4A, left panel). Canonical cell type marker genes were identified for each cluster
and assigned to the tSNE plot to identify shared and unique subpopulations (figure 4A, right panel).
Three major macrophage sub-lineage markers identified in the original BALF scRNA-seq analysis13,
FCN1, SPP1 and FABP4, were separately profiled on the macrophage clusters of the COVID-19 and
TB samples. Of the three markers, FCN1 had highest expression in the TB PBMCs, while FABP4 was
completely absent. The FCN1-expressing pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophage
population was the most abundant of the sub-lineages in severe COVID-19 patients13. Zooming in on
the FCN1- and SPP1-expressing clusters, the additional inflammatory markers that were identified for
these populations in the original analysis were profiled. Both ATB and severe COVID-19 samples

had high expression of these markers (figure 4C) indicating that these immune cell sub-lineages are
active in the inflammatory response elicited by both diseases in the lungs and the blood.
Highly similar enriched ontologies are shared between COVID-19 and tuberculosis
A meta-pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the transcriptomic data from the Leicester
TB19, the COVID-19 WB scRNA-seq data21, and the influenza viral control cohort9. Among the top
1000 DEGs (selection explained in appendix 1 p3,8), DEGs from COVID-19, ATB and TB
progressors were enriched for similar pathways compared to LTBI and influenza (figure 5A, appendix
1 p8, appendix 2 p5). Among the top 100 pathways across all groups, the highest percentage was
associated with COVID-19 (96% of those considered), followed by ATB (93%), progressors (88%),
influenza (64%), and LTBI (28%) (figure 5B). Comparing the twenty most significant ontologies,
influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished on the basis of an absence of IFN-γ
response, lack of TNF signalling, both of which were highly enriched in TB progressors and COVID19 (figure 5A). Interestingly, LTBI had no enrichment of cytokine production and regulation of innate
immune response compared with the other disease states, indicating a less active immunological
response (figure 5A).
To identify some key effectors responsible for the activation of these pathways, ten significant
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network clusters were identified and are represented as annotated
networks in figure 5C. Among the 85 DEGs which were represented in the network analysis, only
nine belonged to influenza, while there was greater alignment of PPI networks between COVID-19
and the TB groups, further confirming the similarity between COVID-19 and TB. Antigen processing
and presentation was the largest cluster and was enriched mostly in COVID-19 and TB groups, with
only one member gene representing influenza. The second most enriched cluster shared between
COVID-19 and TB, annotated as epigenetic regulation of gene expression, consisted of many histone
related proteins, suggesting both result in widespread changes in the epigenome. Other enriched
clusters included platelet activation, cytokine production, and proteasome were exclusively enriched
in COVID-19 and TB, indicating extensive commonality between perturbed pathways (figure 5C, pvalues in appendix 2 p6).

Genes clustered based on similarity between COVID-19 and tuberculosis associate with COVID19 disease severity
Three clusters, based on similarity between the other diseases and COVID-19, were identified (figure
6A). Cluster 1: common to all TB disease states, but absent from influenza, consists of IFN-γ
response, apoptosis signalling and B cell activation pathway enrichment. Cluster 2: common across
all disease groups, except for LTBI, consists of complement activation, inflammatory response,
apoptotic signalling, T cell receptor signalling, and IFN-γ production. Cluster 3: shared between ATB
and TB progressors, but absent from LTBI and influenza, was enriched for platelet degranulation,

autophagy, antigen processing and presentation, TNFA signalling, IL6/JAK/STAT3 signalling, and
cellular processes indicating higher metabolic requirements of cells in response to infection.
Regulation of mTORC1 signalling was the only pathway exclusively enriched in COVID-19 from the
top 100 enriched pathways (figure 6A). To further explore if the enriched pathway DEGs were
associated with severity of COVID-19, GSEA was used to determine enrichment of the three
identified clusters in a WB bulk RNA-seq dataset containing samples from different clinical stages of
COVID-1921. Cluster 1, was found to be enriched in all three COVID-19 disease severity categories
with moderate effect size, while cluster 2 and cluster 3 were enriched in more severe disease states
with larger effect sizes as indicated by the q-values in figure 6B. DEGs common to COVID-19 and
TB states were significantly enriched with increasing COVID-19 severity; 17% were enriched in
moderate COVID-19, 18% were enriched in severe COVID-19 and the greatest proportion, 32%,
were enriched in the ICU group (appendix 1 p9).
The overlap between DEGs associated with COVID-19 disease severity and TB raised the possibility
of an impediment to the discovery of a specific COVID-19 diagnostic WB biomarker.
TBSignatureProfiler was run on cluster-specific DEGs using TCC data. In all three clusters, groups
ranging from TB progressors to ATB showed significant COVID-19 risk scores compared with the
LTBI control group (figure 6C). Cluster 3, which contains the most shared DEGs between COVID19, ATB and TB progressors, exhibited the most graded significant increase in COVID-19 risk scores
among the three clusters, suggesting that shared DEGs between COVID-19 and TB would interfere
with the derivation of a COVID-19-specific diagnostic signature (figure 6C, appendix 2 p9).
To determine whether a more specific COVID-19 diagnostic signature could be identified what would
not be affected by TB co-infection, DEGs from the only COVID-19-specific pathway, mTORC1
signalling (figure 6C), were used to compare the COVID-19 risk scores between the Leicester TB
cohort and the COVID-19 disease severity data. The mTORC1 signature demonstrated a clear
increase in COVID-19 risk score with increasing COVID-19 disease severity (figure 6D); lower
COVID-19 risk scores were generated from the ATB group, with the LTBI contacts and the healthy
controls having similar scores. Using the full list of 820 exclusive pathways enriched in COVID-19
(appendix 2 p10) a 20-gene signature was derived by selecting genes from the top 10 significant
pathways and excluding DEGs shared between any other disease group, enriched for significance
using a ranked GSEA on the COVID-19 severity data (appendix 1 p10–11). This reduced signature
yielded significant differences in risk scores between healthy controls and severe COVID-19
(p<0·005) and ICU patients (p<0·0005), and not TB groups (figure 6D, appendix 2 p13).

Discussion
Emerging findings to aid rapid responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased
deposition of manuscripts on pre-print servers. Whilst they require rigorous peer-review, they have
served as a valuable resource for further hypothesis generation and testing. We used several such
studies to augment investigation of our hypothesis using these sequencing data in combination with
new bioinformatics packages developed for assessing TB diagnostic signature performance.10,12
Substituting TB signatures for COVID-19 signatures, within the TBSignatureProfiler package, we
demonstrate the overlap between severe COVID-19 transcriptional signatures and WB TB disease
phenotypes found in ATB patients and importantly those with asymptomatic TB who progress to
symptomatic TB over 1–2 years.
The most compelling overlaps between COVID-19 signatures and the TB datasets reside in the
circulating innate immune cells. Classical monocyte and neutrophil signatures derived from severe
COVID-19 patients were associated with the highest COVID-19 risk scores when profiled across the
TB spectrum. Circulating monocyte activation status is a determining factor for COVID-19 prognosis,
with specific phenotypes leading to poorer outcomes29. Similar monocyte phenotypes have been
detected during TB infection30 and the presence of these in circulation prior to SARS-CoV-2 coinfection may be detrimental to the activation of key adaptive antiviral immune responses.
Conversely, adaptive immune cell populations enriched in milder COVID-19 cases were associated
with lower risk scores in ATB and progressors. Both T and B cells were significantly reduced in
COVID-19 ICU patient samples compared to pre and post ICU20. Impairment of functional CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells has been associated with severe COVID-1931 and may be exacerbated by the presence of
exhausted T cell phenotypes indicative of chronic Mtb infection which display reduced capacity to
produce effector cytokines32.
SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages are known to accumulate in lungs of patients who died from
COVID-1933. Activated macrophages play a major role in chronic inflammation in TB and HIV and
increase the likelihood of severe COVID-19 infection (odds ratios: 1·7 and 2·3, respectively)34.
FCN1hi macrophages are abundant in the BALF of severe COVID-19 patients13 and in BALF
indicating their migration to the lungs from the blood, substantiated by an integrative analysis
between COVID-19 blood and BALF scRNA-seq samples performed by Silvin et al.21. We show that
both the FNC1hi and FCN1loSPP1+ sub-lineages associated with significantly higher COVID-19 risk
scores in recent contacts of TB patients, progressors, and ATB patients. Our integrative analysis of
TB PBMC and COVID-19 BALF scRNA-seq samples showed the presence of these phenotypes in
circulation during ATB, indicating that the presence of these sub-lineages in the blood may
predispose TB patients to more severe lung inflammation.
The importance of neutrophils has largely been underestimated in existing scRNA-seq workflows,
due to technical issues associated with the preservation and sequencing of neutrophils, despite

evidence that neutrophils are correlated with poor prognosis and disease severity in COVID-1921,35,36,
and out-of-control inflammation or a failure to establish adequate adaptive immune responses in
severe TB37. The upregulation of calprotectin subunit genes S100A8 and S100A9 in these neutrophils
may account for or trigger the cytokine storm that is characteristic of severe COVID-1921 and
S100A8/A9-dependent neutrophilic accumulation in the lungs of ATB patients leads to induction of
inflammatory mediators and promotes lymphocyte trafficking38. These findings underscore the need
for more WB single-cell studies rather than PBMCs in order to characterise the important contribution
of neutrophils to severe COVID-19.
IFN-induced transcriptional signatures were among the most significantly upregulated in severe
disease in the studies selected risk profiling20,24,27,28 and generated high COVID-19 risk scores among
ATB cases. Dysregulation of IFN production23,39 and the nature of type I and III IFN responses
(location, timing, and duration) in COVID-1940,41 and TB42 guide disease progression and outcomes. It
is therefore plausible that dysregulation of type I IFN responses during SARS-CoV-2 co-infection
may also have an impact on TB disease progression.
At a systems levels, shared biological pathways showed a graded enrichment of similar pathways
between COVID-19 and TB, particularly ATB. A PPI-based network analysis identified common
genes, highlighting that shared molecular determinants between COVID-19 and TB disease states can
influence the clinical outcome if both diseases affect the same individual i.e., during co-infection.
Common enriched pathways between COVID-19 and TB signify activation of innate immune
responses directed against both Mtb and SARS-CoV-2 and include antigen presentation27,43,
membrane trafficking44,45, ROS/RNS production46,47, activation of complement48,49, cytokine
production50,51, and platelet activation52,53. This suggests that both hyperactivation of these responses
or evasion by the pathogen may lead to severe clinical presentations for both of these infections and
be synergistically exacerbated in co-infection. These mechanistic similarities would complicate
efforts to derive a COVID-19-specific transcriptional signature. We demonstrated this with a 20-gene
COVID-19-specific signature that gave rise to significantly higher scores among severe COVID-19
cases compared with healthy controls, but also produced slightly elevated scores in TB-infected
individuals.
Although several of the pre-print manuscripts identified at the beginning of our study have since been
published in high-impact journals, our COVID-19 signature search was complicated by the limited
availability of comprehensive supplementary data detailing cluster markers or DEG lists.
Furthermore, the COVID-19 studies performed to date are confined to small numbers of patients in
each group that exhibit inter-individual variability in immune cell phenotypes. We counteracted this
limitation by including signatures from multiple studies for each immune cell population.
In summary, we show for the first time through large scale meta-analysis of the available
transcriptomic data, that advanced COVID-19 and TB disease states overlap at the gene, cell, and
systems levels. These shared disease mechanisms could prove to be hotspots for immune

exacerbation, inducing greater immunopathology, in the case of co-infection. We report a new 20gene gene signature which distinguishes severe COVID-19 from active and LTBI that should be
investigated further for its disease classification value in larger datasets as they become available.
Taken together, the data presented here along with the emerging case reports identifying TB as a risk
factor for severe COVID-19 suggesting that individuals with known previous TB history, recent TB
exposures or LTBI with pre-existing lung pathology, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19
disease and, potentially, early progression to TB disease, following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the
medical capacity to do so, we therefore propose that such individuals should 1) be closely followed to
allow early detection of respiratory symptom onset, 2) be screened for SARS-CoV-2 and TB at
symptom onset, and 3) be followed up for TB in the months subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.
Diagnostic and clinical outcome data arising from early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak should be
stratified by TB history in order to determine the effects of these co-infections as soon as possible.

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Figure 2. Profiling immune cell signatures from COVID-19 patients highlights increasing risk of severe disease
associated with progression to active tuberculosis. COVID-19 immune cell signatures were derived from bulk and
single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies and used to generate putative “COVID-19 risk scores” from a
tuberculosis (TB) whole blood bulk RNA-seq dataset using the TBSignatureProfiler package. TB samples are grouped
according to disease state and COVID-19 signatures were categorised by immune cell or signature type. Scores for
each signature were compared by contrasting each group with the London Latent group using a t-test adjusted for
multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction. All signatures were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) unless otherwise stated in the boxplot title. WB, whole blood; Mφ, macrophage; BALF, bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid; ISG, interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene; NK, natural killer; ICU, intensive care unit; BTM, blood
transcriptional module. *<0·05, **<0·005, ***<0·0005, ****<0·00005.

Figure 3. Risk of developing severe COVID-19 is significantly elevated in patients that progress from latent to
active tuberculosis disease. COVID-19 immune cell signatures that were associated with significant differences in
COVID-19 risk score between controls and progressor/active tuberculosis (TB) cases were validated on two additional
whole blood RNA-sequencing TB datasets - (A) the Adolescent Cohort Study and (B) the Grand Challenges 6 study.
TB samples were classified as latent or progressors and COVID-19 signatures were categorised by immune cell or
signature type. Samples from patients that progressed to active TB disease during the study follow-up period are
coloured and scaled according to time to TB diagnosis, measured in days and plotted on a log2 scale. Scores for each
signature were compared by contrasting progressor with latent cases using a t-test adjusted for multiple testing using a
Bonferroni correction. All signatures were derived from whole blood unless otherwise stated in the boxplot title.

Figure 4. Macrophage subpopulations upregulated in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients can also be found
in the circulation during active tuberculosis disease. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of severe COVID-19 patients (n = 6) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from patients with active tuberculosis (TB) disease (n = 3) were integrated. (A) t-distributed stochastic
neighbour embedding (tSNE) plot of integrated scRNA-seq data in the left panel, with cells from severe COVID-19
patients in guava and those from active TB patients in cyan, with corresponding cell clusters annotated based on
identified markers in the right panel. (B) Macrophage clusters from the severe COVID-19 patients (left column) and
active TB patients (right column), with the expression of major macrophage subpopulation markers identified in the
original COVID-19 study - FCN1, high in G1, low in G2; SPP1, G2 and G3; FABP4, G4 - highlighted in red. (C)
Violin plots depicting the expression levels of additional inflammatory marker genes associated with the macrophage
subpopulations also present in the TB PBMC data, for each macrophage cluster.

Figure 5. Active TB disease and COVID-19 have similar perturbed pathways and gene networks. (A) Heatmap
of the top 20 enriched pathways from the meta-analysis across the groups with the best p-values. Cells are coloured by
their -log10(p-values), grey cells indicate a lack of significant enrichment for that term/ontology in the corresponding
DEGs list. (B) Upset intersection plot showing the number of pathways shared between COVID-19 and the other
groups compared. Wherever the genes are shared the specific coloured dots appear below the column bar graph which
show the number of shared pathways, which are connected by vertical lines, denoting shared categories. The
horizontal bars represent the category gene count and the numbers on the horizontal axes represent the common
pathways between the represented category and COVID-19. (C) All MCODE components from a protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network analysis of all merged gene lists are displayed as networks, nodes are displayed as pie
charts, colour coded by disease group. The labels are added manually and are derived from functional labels based on
the top three enriched terms for that cluster.

Figure 6. Shared COVID-19 and TB cluster differentially expressed genes correlate with disease severity and
interfere with COVID-19-specific gene signature detection. (A) Heatmap of the top 100 enriched pathways and
three identified gene clusters, the circle colours correspond to the groups that formed part of the cluster, the letters in
the circle indicate the groups: C, COVID-19; A, active TB; P, TB progressors; L, latent TB; F, influenza. (B) Bubble
plot depicting the enrichment of identified cluster differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by COVID-19 disease
severity (appendix 2 p8). The size and shade of the circle correspond to the -log10 q-value, represented as a scale on
the right. (C) Box plots of the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) of COVID-19 scores based on the DEGs of each of
the three identified clusters. Membership of the groups in the cluster is indicated in the circle appearing in the title of
each boxplot. Scores for each signature were compared between each group at the “London Latent” control group
using a t-test adjusted for multiple testing using a Bonferroni correction. (D) All pathways identified in the pathway
meta-analysis were considered and selected based on COVID-19 exclusivity; bar plot of GSVA for mTORC1
signalling pathway genes and the reduced COVID-19 20-gene signature, when profiled on the Leicester cohort and
COVID-19 disease severity data. Scores for each signature were compared between each group at the “Healthy
