Abstract
Background
To be universally applicable in treatment of severe COVID-19, novel therapies,
especially those with little toxicity and low cost, are urgently needed. We report here
the use of one such therapeutic combination involving two commonly used
nutraceuticals, namely resveratrol and copper in patients with this disease. This study
was prompted by pre-clinical reports that sepsis-related cytokine storm and fatality in
mice can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and
copper. Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID19, we retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients with this condition who had
received resveratrol and copper.

Methods & Findings
Our analysis comprised of 230 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring inhaled
oxygen who were admitted in a single tertiary care hospital in Mumbai between April
1 and May 13 2020. Thirty of these patients received, in addition to standard care,
resveratrol and copper at doses of 5.6 mg and 560 ng, respectively, orally, once every
6 hours, until discharge or death. These doses were based on our pre-clinical studies,
and were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those recommended
as health supplements. A multivariable-adjusted analysis was used to model the
outcome of death in these patients and evaluate factors associated with this event. A
binary logistic regression analysis was used, with age, sex, presence of comorbidities
and receipt of resveratrol-copper as covariates. Data were updated as of May 30 2020.
The number of deaths in resveratrol-copper and standard care only groups were 7/30

(23.3%, 95% CI 8.1%-38.4%) and 89/200 (44.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-51.3%),
respectively. In multivariable analysis, age >50 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.558, 95% CI
1.454-4.302, P=0.0011] and female sex (OR 1.939, 95% CI 1.079-3.482, P=0.0267)
were significantly associated, while presence of co-morbidities was not significantly
associated (OR 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421) with death. There was a trend
towards reduction in death in patients receiving resveratrol-copper (OR 0.413, 95% CI
0.164-1.039, P= 0.0604).

Conclusions
We provide preliminary results of a novel approach to the treatment of severe COVID19 using a combination of small amounts of commonly used nutraceuticals, which is
non-toxic and inexpensive, and therefore could be widely accessible globally. The
nearly two-fold reduction in mortality with resveratrol-copper observed in our study
needs to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial.

Introduction
It has been previously reported that cell-free chromatin particles that are released from
the billions of cells that die in the body everyday can illegitimately integrate into
genomes of healthy cells to trigger DNA double-strand breaks, apoptosis and release
of inflammatory cytokines1-6. Based on these findings we hypothesized that cell-free
chromatin particles that are released from dying host cells following SARS-COV-2
infection could integrate into genomes of uninfected cells to trigger more host cell
death leading to a vicious cycle of further rounds of DNA damage, apoptosis and
inflammation. These events could perpetuate and amplify the pathological effects of
SARS-COV-2 infection. This hypothesis was supported by our preclinical study which
demonstrated that endotoxin induced cytokine storm and sepsis related fatality in mice
can be prevented by oral administration of small quantities of resveratrol and copper7.
Since cytokine storm and sepsis are major causes of death in severe COVID-198, we
analyzed the efficacy of R-Cu in preventing death from this condition.
Resveratrol is an anti-oxidant nutraceutical plant polyphenol which has been
extensively researched for its health benefits9. It has been reported that resveratrol
acts as a pro-oxidant in presence of copper
nutraceutical

which is another widely researched

Resveratrol can reduce copper (II) to copper (I) thereby generating

highly unstable free-radicals

and can

lead to prevention of endotoxin sepsis in mice 7. The pro-oxidant activity of resveratrolcopper is maintained even when the molar concentration of copper is reduced 10,000
fold

Doses of resveratrol and copper taken by the patients included in this

analysis were nearly 50 times and 2000 times less, respectively, than those currently
recommended as health supplements 15, 16.

Methods
Patient Characteristics
Patients with severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy and who had been admitted
to B. Y. L. Nair Charitable Hospital and TN Medical College, Mumbai, under a single
faculty member (RD) were provided access to resveratrol-copper. All patients had
dyspnea, oxygen saturation of ≤ 92% at room air and lung opacities on chest
radiographs. Patient characteristics are described in Table 1.

Standard of Care
All patients received standard of care as follows: high flow oxygen which was
administered through nasal prongs or face masks with properly fitted circuits or
through high flow oxygen nasal cannulas. The flow rates were adjusted to deliver
adequate oxygenation, and awake proning was performed. If patients deteriorated,
they were intubated and put on a ventilator. Patients were administered oral
hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by 400 mg once a day for
4 days. Azithromycin 500 mg was administered once a day for 5 days, and vitamin D
60,000 units once per week for 6 weeks and vitamin C 500 mg once a day. Low
molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin in therapeutic doses was given to
all patients with serum D–dimer levels of > 6, while prophylactic anticoagulation with
either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin was administered to
patients with D-dimer levels between 3 and 6. Patients with oxygen requirement of >6
litres per minute were also administered injectable methylprednisolone at a dose of
40mg twice a day for short durations. Treatment of comorbidities like diabetes and
hypertension were treated appropriately. Diabetes was treated with insulin.

Resveratrol-Copper Intervention
Trans-resveratrol was procured from Biotivia LLC, USA, and chelated copper from J
R Carlson Laboratories Inc., USA. Resveratrol (5.6 mg) was suspended in 20 mL of
water and administered orally followed by 20 mL of water as wash down. Copper (560
ng) in 20 mL of water-based solution was administered orally immediately afterwards
followed by 20 mL of water as wash down. This resveratrol -copper treatment was
given every 6 hours until the patient was discharged or died. These human doses of
resveratrol and copper were arrived at by direct conversion of doses employed in our
pre-clinical studies using a conventional formula 17.

Study Design & Outcome Measures
Clinical outcome of patients receiving resveratrol -copper was compared with 200
contemporaneously treated patients with severe COVID-19 and same clinical criteria,
at the same institution. The primary outcome measure was death due to any cause
within 28 days of diagnosis.

Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis was a binary logistic regression with inclusion of age, sex,
presence of comorbidities (as a single variable), and use of resveratrol -copper as
covariates in all patients fulfilling eligibility criteria. The likelihood ratio was utilized to
examine the significance of covariates included in the model with a two-sided P-value
of less than 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. Additional analyses were
performed to compare the proportion of deaths within subgroups defined by age, sex,

presence of comorbidities and use of resveratrol -copper, using chi-square test. All
statistical analyses were performed with R 3.6.3 software (https://cran.r-project.org/).

Study Oversight
This observational study was approved by the Ethics Committee of BYL Nair Hospital,
Mumbai. The study is registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India; Registration
Number CTRI/2020/06/026256 The analysis was conducted adhering to ethical
principles, including maintaining patient confidentiality. All authors vouch for the
accuracy of data and analysis.

Results
Participants
Between April 1 and May 13, 2020, 241 patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria for this
analysis were admitted, of whom 32, admitted under a single faculty member, received
resveratrol-copper (Table 1). Of these 241 patients, nine receiving standard treatment
and one patient receiving resveratrol-copper took discharge from the hospital against
medical advice, while one patient receiving resveratrol-copper was transferred to
another hospital for renal dialysis. The current analysis includes remaining 230
patients of whom 30 patients received resveratrol-copper.

Demographics
Mean ages (±SD) of the patients were 49.16 ±11 years and 51.3 ±15.96 years in the
resveratrol -copper and control groups, respectively; while corresponding proportions
of female patients were 10 (33.3%) and 65 (32.5%), and patients with comorbidities

were 20 (66.7%) and 101 (50.5%), respectively. The complete set of de-identified data
used in this analysis will be provided on request.

Outcome
At the time of analysis, 7 of 30 patients (23.3%) who had been treated with resveratrol
-copper and 89 of 200 patients (44.5%) who had not received resveratrol -copper had
died [odds ratio (OR) of death, 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.156 to 0.925;
P=0.0284] (Table 1). In multivariable analysis, increasing age was the most significant
adverse prognostic factor (OR of death, 2.558; 95% CI, 1.456 to 4.495; P=0.001)
(Table 2). Female sex was also a significant adverse factor (OR of death, 1.939; 95%
CI, 1.079 to 3.482; P=0.026). Death due to co-morbidities failed to reach statistical
significance (OR of death, 0.713, 95% CI 0.405-1.256, P=0.2421). Treatment with
resveratrol -copper showed a trend towards reducing deaths (OR of death, 0.413; 95%
CI, 0.164 to 1.039; P=0.0604) (Table 2).

Discussion
The results of this retrospective study suggest that treatment with a combination of the
nutraceuticals resveratrol and copper administered in minuscule quantities could lead
to a nearly 2-fold reduction in mortality in patients suffering from severe COVID-19
and associated ARDS. The mechanism of action of resveratrol-copper in COVID-19
patients is unclear, but could be related to the generation of free radicals which can
inactivate or degrade cell-free chromatin released from dying cells and contributing to
the sepsis cascade. Not being a randomized clinical trial, results of this study should
be considered as hypothesis generating rather than being confirmatory. Nonetheless,

to our knowledge this is one of the few studies to show that a therapeutic intervention
can prevent death from this serious condition.

The overall mortality in admitted patients in our series is 41.7%, which is higher than
that reported in other series18,19. This is likely because many patients arrived at
the hospital in severe sepsis and advanced hypoxemia and died rapidly after
admission. We also observe, like almost all other series, that increasing age and
presence of comorbidity increases the odds of death. However, unlike others, our
analysis suggests that female patients have a higher risk of dying compared with
men, even after adjusting for age and presence of comorbidity. This has also been
noted in other analyses from India

19

but the reasons are unclear. It is possible

that, because of socioeconomic reasons, female patients are brought to the hospital
when they have very severe disease and a disease-severity adjusted analysis will
overcome this confounding. Nutritional deficiencies like iron deficiency and others
are also more prevalent in Indian women and could play a role in this observation.

In conclusion, our results of treating severe COVID-19 patients with a combination
of the nutraceuticals resveratrol and copper are promising which need to be confirmed
in a randomized clinical trial.
