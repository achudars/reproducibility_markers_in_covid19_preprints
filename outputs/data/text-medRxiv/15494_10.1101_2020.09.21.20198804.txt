Abstract
Introduction: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where overloaded health systems seem
inevitable, there is a need for reliable, conceptually adequate, and easily applied measurement tools
to identify health professionals at risk. Objective: to present the preliminary psychometric
properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES) and its association with important
outcomes, i.e., moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. Methods: The BBES has 4
Likert-type items and was tested as part of a cross-sectional study that included 401 medical
students. Reliability analysis and validity studies were performed. Results: In the parallel analysis,
two factors were extracted, explaining 84.4% of the variance. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.78,
showing high internal consistency. Considering a cut-off point of 12, the odds ratio for moderate
to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001) and for last month suicidal ideation 2.96 (CI
1.6-5.48). Conclusion: The results suggest good psychometric characteristics for the BBES, thus
reinforcing its utility as an assessment tool for evaluating the well-being or distress of health
professionals. It carries with it the potential to implement early interventions and to prevent the
descent into burnout so common today in the health care task force during the pandemic.
Keywords: health care professionals; burnout syndrome; COVID-19; depression; suicide
Introduction
In the last two decades the health care task force has been recognized as going through an
increasing rate of distress and emotional strain. Various combinations of burnout, depression, and
suicidal ideation lead to work-related stress as well as other psychiatric symptoms. A recent
review showed that exhaustion and mental illness already affect, on average, 30-60% of all
physicians and/or physicians-in- training in North America.1 These percentages will undoubtedly
climb as a result of the additional stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, where health
professionals face demanding scenarios in which their ongoing capacity to function may be
seriously compromised to the point of collapse. A study that evaluated 1257 professionals who
treated patients exposed to COVID-19 in China found symptoms of depression in 50.4%, anxiety
in 44.6%, insomnia in 34% and distress in 71.5% of the total sample.2
In the current context of this pandemic, health care professionals are in desperate need of
reliable, conceptually appropriate, and easily applied measurement tools to identify individuals at

risk for the Burnout Syndrome. Indeed, burnout as a construct has been hotly debated in the
literature.3 Some authors assert that it could simply be an alternative to depression that is less
stigmatizing to many physicians. However, recent evidence has clarified that burnout and
depression are related but distinct constructs. In fact, burnout symptoms may lead to more serious
outcomes, including significant depression and suicidal ideation or attempts. Moreover, even
when controlling for depression, burnout symptoms result in considerable costs to the individual,
the quality of patient care, and to society itself.1,4-7 These studies also reveal that the key
dimensions that most clearly characterize patients with burnout are emotional exhaustion (EE) and
depersonalization (DP) as defined by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and/or the Oldenburg
Burnout Inventory. Those two dimensions are also the ones more related to depression and
psychological distress.3, 5 Therefore, an early detection of those symptoms could be used as a
marker of risk and perhaps lead to earlier treatment that heads off more severe outcomes. Tools
sensitive enough to detect these symptoms can be used to monitor the health professionals, and to
implement interventions earlier in the process of the stress continuum. They can also be used to
measure the effectiveness of those interventions.
The purpose of this brief communication is to present the preliminary psychometric
properties of a Brief Burnout Evaluation Scale (BBES), and its association with significant
outcomes, i.e. moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation. In the current setting, the BBES
is designed to function as a tool to identify distress more clearly among health care professionals
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
The 4 items of BBES were developed from an online survey that evaluated 2537 Brazilian
medical students and doctors in October 2019, through the MBI (submitted manuscript). The two

EE items (r = 0.87; r = 0.88) and the two DP items (r = 0.81; r = 0.77) of the MBI that were most
correlated with the total score of each dimension were adapted and modified to create the BBES
items. The BBES is a five-point Likert self-administered scale, ranging from "totally false" (0) to
"totally true" (4) (TABLE 1).
In a second step, the BBES was tested as part of a cross-sectional study conducted between
November 2019 and March 2020, which included 401 students regularly enrolled in the medical
course at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The data were collected through
an online questionnaire on the SurveyMonkey® platform, preserving the anonymity of the
participants. The questionnaire contained socio-demographic variables and questions related to
mental health (such as suicide ideation in the last month) and the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI).8 The studies were approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto
Alegre (CAAE 70231617600005327 and 85311418800005327 respectively).
The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (KMO) and Bartlett's sphericity test were used to verify
whether the data were subject to factor analysis. A polychoric correlation matrix was performed,
along with an exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation to assess the underlying structure
of the scale. The number of factors was determined by the method of parallel analyzes. Internal
validity was tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.
An initial cut-off point was suggested, considering that, on average, the subject responded
“partially true” to the four symptoms. Considering this proposed cut-off point, the odds ratio for
moderate to severe depression, according to the BDI8, and for suicidal ideation in the last month
was estimated using logistic regression model. Further odds tests for moderate to severe depression
according to the BDI diagnosis of moderate to severe depression were further performed for cutoff points between 10 and 14 points in the BBES. The analyzes were performed in the R program

(r-project.org) using the psych package version 1.9.12. Whenever necessary, a significance level
of 5% was adopted.
Results
The mean age was 23.1 and the standard deviation was 3.3 years. Most of the sample
consisted of caucasian students (73.2%) and women (54.9%); 67 students (16.7%) had moderate
to severe depression according to the BDI, 48 (12%) suicidal ideation in the last month.
A KMO index 0.64 and a Bartlett sphericity test with p <0.001, showed the adequacy of
the use of factor analysis to evaluate the data. In the parallel analysis, two factors were extracted,
explaining 84.4% of the total variance. Items EE1 and EE2 presented factorial loads of 0.91 and
0.84 on the first factor, and items DP1 and DP2 loads of 0.75 and 0.80 on the second factor. The
estimated correlation between the factors was 0.51. The Cronbach's alpha for the total score was
0.78, showing high internal consistency.
The score can certainly be used as a continuous variable for several purposes, such as
evaluating the staff over a course of time, both to early intervene in the case of health deterioration
as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. However, it is often desirable to establish
a cut-off point, at least one to be further tested as valid. Considering a suggested cut-off point of
12 or more, the odds ratio (OR) for moderate to severe depression was 3.01 (CI 1.7-5.22; p<0.001)
and for suicidal ideation in the last month 2.96 (CI 1.6-5.48). With a cut-off point of 10 or more
the OR for moderate to severe depression was 3.99 (CI 2.11-7.54; p<0.001); with a cut-off point
of 11 or more it was 3.73 (CI 2.1-.6.62; p<0.001); with a cut-off point of 13 or more it was 3.94
(CI 2.2-.7.06; p<0.001); and with a cut-off point of 14 or more 5.14 (CI 2.64-10; p<0.001). This
finding reinforces what has been shown in the literature - namely, that burnout symptoms can be

an important marker of emotional distress. Hence, they can be systematically used to monitor the
mental health/well-being of the health care staff.
Conclusion
This study intends to provide a brief, reliable and free-of-charge scale as soon as possible
to assess the presence of symptoms of burnout in students and health professionals in Brazil. This
need becomes more urgent in the face of the global crisis caused by the pandemic of COVID-19.
Due to the current fragility and overload of different health systems, the early identification of
cases is essential, not only to protect professionals from burning out, but also to protect patients
from the consequences that it may bring to the quality of care. The clear correlation of the scale
with serious outcomes, such as significant depression and suicidal ideation, reinforce the utility of
the BBES as an assessment tool for evaluating the continuum from well-being to distress of health
professionals, making it possible to implement early interventions and sparing the task force.
The study has limitations, inherent to preliminary studies that need replication in larger
samples, other contexts and with more sophisticated methodologies. However, it brings to society,
in an urgent moment, a tool with great potential use that can be applied even in remote regions of
the country.
