Abstract
When an outbreak starts spreading, policy makers have to make decisions that
affects health of their citizens and the economic. Some might induce harsh
measures, such as lockdown. Following a long harsh lockdown, economical
declines force policy makers to rethink reopening. But what is the most effective
reopening strategy? In order to provide an effective strategy, here we propose a
control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social
performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals’
propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision makers to find optimal
lockdown and exit strategy for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is
minimized. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is
performed to validate our model and its results.

1 Introduction
According to World Health Organization (WHO) the first death due to SARS-COV2 infection was reported on January 11, 2020 in China Wuhan [1]. The origin of the
virus still remains uncertain. By the end of August 2020, close to 25 million people
had been infected worldwide by COVID-19 virus and over 843,000 people have died
(John Hopkins Center [2]). The virus spread between nations quickly and it became
a global concern.
Currently many countries are practicing community-based measurements to mitigate the spread of the virus. The policy makers and governments have tried to
control the epidemic based on the limited medical resources that makes a delay in
the infection peak, providing more time to produce a vaccine [3]. As a result, the
closure of many businesses has been implemented which leads to some economical
loss [4]. It raises the question: “what are the alternative interventions with lowest
negative economic impact?”
When a Susceptible person makes a contact with a contagious individual, he/she
may become Exposed. It will take some time till the symptoms appear. A person
might become Infectious before being symptomatic. Finally that person will be
Removed either through death or recovery with temporary immunity. SEIR models
or SIR models, as their names indicate are mathematical models that are used to
describe individuals transitioning between these stages. For classical references on
virus dynamics refer to [5, 6, 7, 8].

To address several questions on the control strategy of the COVID-19 pandemic,
we propose an optimization model based on the SIR model by considering some
important factors such as; the stress on the health care system, the financial loss,
the activity level during lockdown, and individual behavior factor. Our contributions
include the following epidemic management features:
• We investigate a state-space model using the real-time temporary sentiment to
obtain the final sentiment information. We apply individuals’ posts on Twitter
based on emotion and user interest that reflects public sentiment in real-time
in regards to the current global outbreak.
• We consider an information system which is consisting of the processes of
learning and forgetting of information. This model considers the impact of
individuals’ propensities toward pandemic.
• In the proposed policy, population is divided into two groups based of individuals’ propensities. The percentage of individuals with high-risk behavior is
S H , the percentage of individuals with low-risk behavior is S L .
• We suggest an online control strategy using data-driven method that provides
a real-time health data such as the percentage of individuals who want to wear
a mask S M .
• We propose an optimal lockdown policy that minimizes the financial loss
which is associated with social performance and the stress on the health care
system. The efficiency measures such as the speed of learning in the health
care system during the pandemic are also considered in the proposed control
policy.
The next section shows details of our proposed optimal control strategy that considers online disease information system to minimize the financial loss during the
pandemic. In Section 3 we will show how are optimization model can be implied to
real data. As an example we consider LA County. Section 4 summarizes our main
findings and discusses possible directions for future study.

2 The proposed control strategy of pandemic
2.1 The disease information
Within a routine day each person makes both local and global communications.
Each individual has a unique understanding from the epidemic and chooses different
precautions to protect themselves from the virus. They receive information about
disease from both their local and global networks. Local networks such as home or
their neighborhoods, global network such as social media. Based on the amount of
the disease information that individuals acquire they change their behavior during
the epidemic.
Social media offer a platform for sharing disease information [9]. Currently people
use the microblogging platform Twitter with over 300 million monthly users to
share their ideas and feeling about a wide range of subjects. The governmental
agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
World Health Organization (WHO) have used Twitter’s potential to update people
about disease information. Using Twitter data to get an understanding of real-time
individual’s behavioral response to an event is a well-accepted tool. For instance,
during Ebola virus (EV) outbreak in 2014 [10], during the spread of influenza in

2009 [11], during Syndrome outbreak in 2015 [12] and the Zika virus epidemic [13]
researchers used Twitter dataset. Tweets which demonstrate public sentiment in
regarding with the outbreak are related to emotions of fear, anger and surprise. In
this research, we extract samples from tweets which contain positive and negative
attitudes about the current pandemic to determine the temporary public sentiment.
We develop a statistical technique for predicting and tracking sentiment polarity
and individuals’ behaviors from social media during health emergencies such as
COVID-19. The disease information system is characterized through the definition
of input or observed information, state variables, and output information [14]. The
observed information are external entities that are added into the system and can
serve as control noise or inputs. State variables are unobserved information that
evolve through time following a given state equation and also depending on the
values of the observed information. Lastly, output information results from the
realization of the state plus noise factors and represent the observable outcome of the
information system [15]. We run a state-space model which is a flexible framework
with time-varying parameters to forecast the temporary sentiment polarity over
time.
Suppose y1 ,. . . ,yn is a series of fear-sentiment observations at time n and p1 ,. . . ,pn
refer to the unobserved states at time n that depend on the observation sets. The
main idea behind state-space approach is to predict the state variables that depend
on the observed sentiment information. The following equations show the observation equation and the state equation, respectively:

yn = vn pn + εn ; εn ∼ N (0, hn )

pn+1 = kn pn + ε0n ; ε0n ∼ N (0, ψn )

(1)

(2)

where the error terms εn and ε0n are assumed to be independent of each other.
Let ψn and hn denote the covariance matrices of the error terms, vn and kn are the
ones that define how the observations relate to the state and how the state evolves
over time.
Memory cells can store and retrieve the disease information. The disease information is being forgotten over time. Jaber and Bonney [16] studied the learning
and forgetting information process. If a represents the degree of learning and b
denotes the rate of forgetting of information, then after n time periods, memory
performance, z, can be measured by the following formula.

z = a · n−b ; 0 < a, b < 1.

(3)

An individual is able to learn new information by α0 pn+1 , while the past information is being forgotten by (1 − α0 )fn . Finally, the final sentiment, f , is (Bi et al,
[17]) calculated as follows,
fn+1 = α0 pn+1 + (1 − α0 )fn ,

f is the memory performance over the longest memory epoch

2.2 The individual with low-risk behavior
When facing a pandemic different individuals have different responses. Some might
self isolate most of the time, some might keep some of their social activities and some
never follow any social distancing rules. In fact a wide range of rationale is involved.
It could be because of the type of the job that a person has, like social workers,
medical personnel and cab drivers, but here in this study we are considering the
impact of fear sentiment. Behavior of individuals heavily depends on the amount of
fear sentiment which they receive (Bi et al [17]).
As mentioned above, we denote the individuals with low-risk behavior by S L ,
where superscript L stands for low-risk. To calculate the fraction of population
with low-risk behavior we use a “satellite” equation [18]. Jahedi and Yorke in [18]
introduce the idea of using satellite equations. A satellite equation is an equation
that is added to a model to calculate new quantities without changing the original
model. We use the “Model E+” introduce by Jahedi and Yorke in [18] as our primary
model to describe the pandemic. The Model E+ is as follows,
In+1 = Sn (1 − e−βn In )

(5a)

Sn+1 = Sn − In+1

(5b)

where In denotes the fraction of individuals who are infectious throughout the week
n and Sn denotes the fraction of individuals who are susceptible at the beginning
of week n respectively. The only parameter of the above model that needs to be
specified to produce the pandemic is the contact rate in week n which is denoted
by βn . According to Poisson distribution when the expected number of events in a
unit time is λ and events occur independently, then the probability that an event
does not occur is exp(−λ). Susceptible individuals on average make βn In infectious
contact, therefore the probability that no new infectious case happens in week n
is exp(−βn In ), therefore the number of new infectious cases in week n + 1 will be
calculated by Eq. 5a above.
Let us assume that we want to produce the pandemic using the real data. By
assuming that S0 = 1, i.e. initially everyone is susceptible, then Model E+ (5)
suggests that we can calculate the contact rate in week n by the following equation.

βn = −

1
In+1
Pn
ln(1 −
).
In
1 − i=1 In

(6)

As mentioned above In is the fraction infectious in week n and can be calculated
using real data.
Once we calculate the contact rates using Eq. (6), we can plug it in Model (5)
and produce the outbreak. Now we have the fraction susceptible in each week, we

finally calculate the probability that an individual wants to have low-risk behavior
by the next satellite equation Chen et al [19],

SnL = Sn

exp fn θ
,
1 + exp fn θ

(7)

where θ is a coefficient to amplify the final sentiment and SnL is the
percentage of


susceptible individuals with low-risk behavior. The ratio exp fn θ / 1 + exp fn θ
is the rate at time period n at which susceptible individuals choose to have low-risk
behaviors.
2.2.1 Why we should all be wearing face masks
COVID-19 is a global pandemic that mostly spreads by asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients because individuals often do not know if they are infected
with the COVID-19. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the percentage of infected individuals by the classical SIR model when almost everyone is susceptible.
To address the issues, we calculate the susceptible population based on individuals’
propensities that considers the susceptible individuals with high-risk and low-risk
behaviors.
Face masks combined with other preventive measures, such as self-quarantine and
frequent hand-washing, help slow the spread of the virus [20]. The Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) recommends community face masks for the public, while the
N95 and surgical masks are needed by health care providers. Modeling and tracking
public sentiment can provide key information for decision making to control the
pandemic. Using the temporary public sentiment related to masks, we calculate the
probability that an individual wants to wear mask by the next satellite equation,

SnM

= SnL
1 + exp fnM λ

(8)

where SnM is the ratio of individuals with low risk behaviors who wear mask and
fnM denotes the final sentiment related to masks and λ is a coefficient that amplifies
the public sentiment polarity about masks.
2.3 Optimal threshold between health care system and economic activity
Another major open question, affecting the decisions of policy makers, is how to
calculate the relation between health care system and economic activity using the
actual number of COVID-19 infections. To address this issue, we introduce an optimization formulation to obtain the optimal activity level during lockdown that
minimizes the financial loss and the stress of health care system. The first term in
the right hand side of Eq. (9a) is the stress in the health care system that determines by proportional to Iˆn , a factor c2 that is the efficiency level or the speed of
learning related to the health care sector, and a coefficient c1 that shows the burden
of new infections on the health care system which is calibrated by the damage of

the pandemic on economic about the U.S. of 13 trillion dollars corresponding to
61% of the annual U.S. GDP (Gonzalez [21]). The relation between the activity
level (social performance) and financial loss during the pandemic is considered in
the second term in the right hand side of Eq. (9a) where ω1 and ω2 are the scaling
and shift parameter (Chen et al. [19]).
The constraint Eq. (9b) is a possibly time-varying infection rate that reflects
government policy such as the activity level. By increasing activity level u∗n , the
percentage of infection goes up that causes a burden on the health care sector. Let
γ denote the growth rate of the percentage of infected individuals [10, 22]. The last
constraint is the optimal activity level u∗n which is limited between 0 and 1.

Using the proposed algorithm (which is called Algorithm 1), by forecasting the temporary public sentiment, first we calculate the final sentiment (FS) using the rate
of learning and forgetting information. We determine the percentage of infected
persons and the percentage of susceptible persons using the SIR model. Then, we
determine the percentage of individuals who have high fear and follow low-risk
behavior. The percentage of people who wear a mask is also determined by a satellite equation. Finally, we solve an optimization model to find optimal threshold of
activity level and the financial loss during the epidemic.

3 Experimental results
3.1 COVID-19 dataset
Twitter is a valuable platform for analyzing and tracking public sentiment where
millions of users share their feelings. We carried out an experimental study of the
proposed model by Tweet dataset in California. We are continuously gathering the
dataset since March 5, 2020 until July 6, 2020. The data that were obtained from [23]
were used to evaluate the framework. Each file has about 200 thousand rows, and
each row contains tweet id, date/time, location, text, user id, and user verified.
The polarity of the sentiments is distributed across the scale between [-1,0), 0, and
(0,+1] that shows negative, natural, and positive polarity, respectively. We extract
samples from tweets which contain positive and negative attitudes about the current
pandemic to determine the temporary sentiment information. Figure 1 represents
the number of neutral, negative, and positive tweets. Other datasets related to the
COVID-19 pandemic such as the number of confirmed cases in LA County can be
also found in the USAFacts dataset [24].
We run a time-series analysis to predict the range of temporary sentiment over
time. Figure 2 predicts the temporary sentiment information using time-series
method in a state-space framework.

behaviors S H (n), the percentage of susceptible individuals with low-risk behavior
S L (n), and the percentage of susceptible individuals with low-risk behavior who
wear mask S M (n). Lastly, we obtain the optimal activity level that minimizes the
financial loss during the pandemic. Figure 3 presents the contact rate of detectable
infected individuals over time in LA County which is calculated using Eq. (6).
We now can determine the number of susceptible and infected individuals using
Model E+ 5. The number of infected individuals in LA County over 40 weeks is
shown in Figure 4.
In this study, we consider the susceptible individuals under two types of behaviors. One group is the percentage of susceptible individuals with risky behaviors,
while other group is the percentage of susceptible individuals with low-risk behaviors. Individuals will change their behaviors during the pandemic based on the final
sentiment information which they receive. The total number of susceptible individuals is shown in Figure 5a and the number of susceptibles with low-risk behavior is
shown in Figure 5b.
The percentage of individuals with low-risk behaviors can help the service
providers to find the optimal response and recovery strategy during the epidemic.
For example, the transit system needs to estimate the actual demands and design

the fleet during the epidemic. Additionally, suppliers can take advantage of the activity level information to manage supply chain risk and disruption in directing the
flow of goods to demand nodes during the pandemic. As Figure 5b represents the
percentage of susceptible with low-risk behaviors increases at the first of the epidemic, because the individuals have high fear. However, it goes down at the peak of
the COVID-19 pandemic and finally it increases during the remaining time periods
of the pandemic.
The health care sector and medical professionals are facing challenges like never
before due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We solve an optimization model based on
Eq (9) that minimizes the total cost in terms of the stress of health care system and
the financial loss associated with social performance. Prediction of the pandemic
duration can help the policy makers to forecast the end time of lockdown to avoid
consequent social-economic damages as well. The optimal activity level during lockdown is determined using the provided information by solving the SIR model. A

This study explores the determinants of switching behaviors in the social activity
level. The impact of heterogeneous susceptible (who have low-risk behavior S L
and wear a mask S M ) on Iˆn is also considered in Eq. (9b). Figure 6a shows the
impact of individual behaviors on the optimal activity level during the epidemic in
LA County. The results show that the optimal activity level is decreased until 0
% during weeks 18 through 24 where a homogeneous population of susceptible is
considered. The social performance level is dropped until 40 % when considering
a heterogeneous population of susceptible that includes individuals with high fear.
The impact of susceptible individuals who wear a mask is also shown in Figure 6a,
while the optimal activity level is reduced until until 10 %. Likewise, a sensitivity
analysis on γ (between 0.1 and 0.7) and the optimal activity level that reflects the
stress of health care system during the pandemic is shown in Figure 6b.
3.2.2 Online social distancing monitoring
Wearing a mask helps prevent the spread of COVID-19, especially those at highrisk. In this study, we use the tweets about mask to analyze the effect of face masks
on the percentage of susceptible people who follow social distancing. The number
of tweets related to masks in California from March 5t h to July 6t h, 2020 is 86365.
Daily number of tweets related to masks is shown in Figure 7a. Before May 30, 2020,
our analysis showed a very small number of tweets related to mask followed by a
steady increase starting June 1, 2020. We analyzed tweets about masks for negative,
neutral, and positive polarity. Figure 7b shows an analysis of tweets sentiment
polarity about masks. Using the temporary sentiment related to masks, we are
able to calculate the percentage of individuals who want to wear mask. Figure 8
shows susceptible individuals with low-risk behavior and susceptible persons who
wear a mask. Analysis of such data showed that 77% of people in LA County wear

internet survey of a national sample of 503 adults and the result indicates that
the percentage of adults endorsing face mask wearing is about 76% [26]. Therefore,
not only the proposed online strategy mitigates the pandemic, but also provides
real-time health data based on individuals’ propensities.
3.2.3 The sensitivity analysis of learning and forgetting disease information
The individuals communicate by sharing their sentiment to each other where their
individual’s brains store and retrieve the disease information during the pandemic.
The individual’s brain can make lots of daily decisions about whether to store
facts and events. Some of experiences will be stored in the brain for a few seconds
or minutes and finally forgotten. However, some of experiences and facts will be
remained for a few days, while others will be ingrained for many years or even
a lifetime. If individuals decide to remember the disease information, the brain
makes connections between the cells, which alters their structure, and is what allows

to the learning and forgetting factors for individuals.
We calculate the individual’s memory performance measure based on Eq. (3).
A sensitivity analysis of the FS by changing the forgetting factor of individual’s
memory between 0.1 and 0.9 is shown in Figure 9a. As a result, the rate of the FS

Figure 9c shows a sensitivity analysis on the forgetting sentiment information

during the pandemic has also affected by the longest memory epoch nf . Thus, we
analysis the relation between the longest memory epoch nf and the number of
susceptible individuals who have high fear as shown in Figure 9d. Individuals will
have the lower risk behavior and higher infections when the longest memory epoch
nf goes up.

4 Conclusions
This paper presents the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using the complex
interactions among disease, social and economic systems and infrastructures. We

proposed an optimal strategy model for pandemics that considers the interaction of
individuals to obtain the temporary sentiment information and the final sentiment
information. A fear information function based on the final sentiment information
is calculated to find the percentage susceptible individuals with high fear and low
fear. Then, we proposed the SIR model for COVID-19 to determine the percentage
of infected persons and the percentage of susceptible persons over time. Lastly, we
solved an optimization formulation to find trade-off between social performance and
limited medical resources. We proposed optimal lockdown and exit strategy during
an epidemic for each state or territory that helps the policy makers during the
pandemic.
The proposed model helps us to understand the impact of epidemic on transport
modes and travel patterns of individuals. Such this information helps us to solve
the challenges of the last mile delivery, multi-tiered delivery, and delivery on demand during the pandemic. For example, the transit service providers can control
customer demands during the pandemic by predicting the percentage of individuals
who have participated social distancing. Additionally, the proposed policy can monitor the human behaviors during epidemic in order to control the stress of health care
sector. The proposed optimal strategy also provides a systematic recovery strategy
after the pandemic. Other human trajectory datasets collected from the movement
of individuals during the pandemic can be used to update the proposed optimal
control strategy model [28]. Finally, an agent-based simulation based on the human
trajectory for estimating the transmission of disease information between agents
during the pandemic would be highly valuable.

Authors’ contributions
Our contributions include the following epidemic management features: When an outbreak starts spreading, policy
makers have to make decisions that affects health of their citizens and the economic. Some might induce harsh
measures, such as lockdown. Following a long harsh lockdown, economical declines force policy makers to rethink
reopening. But what is the most effective reopening strategy? In order to provide an effective strategy, here we
propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical
resources by determining individuals’ propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision makers to find optimal
lockdown and exit strategy for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. In addition, a study of a
COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results. Our contributions
include the following epidemic management features:
• We investigate a state-space model using the real-time temporary sentiment to obtain the final sentiment
information. We apply individuals’ posts on Twitter based on emotion and user interest that reflects public
sentiment in real-time in regards to the current global outbreak.
• We consider an information system which is consisting of the processes of learning and forgetting of
information. This model considers the impact of individuals’ propensities toward pandemic.
• In the proposed policy, population is divided into two groups based of individuals’ propensities. The
percentage of individuals with high-risk behavior is S H , the percentage of individuals with low-risk behavior
is S L .
• We suggest an online control strategy using data-driven method that provides a real-time health data such
as the percentage of individuals who want to wear a mask S M .
• We propose an optimal lockdown policy that minimizes the financial loss which is associated with social
performance and the stress on the health care system. The efficiency measures such as the speed of learning
in the health care system during the pandemic are also considered in the proposed control policy.
