Abstract:
Background: SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates a wide range of severity, the more severe cases demonstrate a
cytokine storm with elevated serum interleukin-6, hence IL-6 receptor antibody Tocilizumab was tried for the
management of severe cases. Objectives: The effect of Tocilizumab treatment on the composite outcome of
ventilator free days, among critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients. Method: Retrospective observational propensity
score matching study, comparing mechanically ventilated patients upon ICU admission who received Tocilizumab
to a control group. Utilizing competing risk analysis method, and reporting sub-distributional hazard ratio of a
composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28. Results: 29 patients in the intervention group were compared to
29 patients in the control group. Matched groups were similar at base line. The primary outcome of ventilator free
days was higher in the intervention group (SHR 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2 – 6.3; p = 0.02), crude ICU mortality rate was not
different between Tocilizumab and control groups (37.9% versus 62% respectively, p = 0.1), actual ventilator free
days were significantly longer in Tocilizumab group (mean difference 4.7 days, 95% CI 1.1 – 8.3; p = 0.02).
Sensitivity analysis by Cox regression showed a significantly lower hazard ratio of death in Tocilizumab group (HR
0.49, 95% CI: 0.25 – 0.97; p = 0.04). While there was no difference in grown positive cultures among groups
(55.2% in Tocilizumab group versus 34.5% in the control, 95% CI of difference: -7.11% to 54.4%; p = 0.1).
Conclusion: Tocilizumab may improve the composite outcome of ventilator free days at day 28 among
mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients, it is associated with significantly longer actual ventilator free days,
and insignificantly lower mortality and superinfection.

Introduction:
An international pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March
11th, 2020 as result of a rapidly spreading viral infection causing pneumonia and respiratory
symptoms (1), the responsible virus was identified to be a novel positive-sense-single strand RNA
virus, of the family coronaviridae, capable of infecting a range of hosts including humans, that
soon came to be recognized as SARS-CoV-2 (2). Despite all measures of containment, the
pandemic spread all over the world, so that by October 15th, 2020 more than 38 million cases
have been confirmed, and more than 1 million fatalities worldwide (1). It is well known, however;
that not all positive cases demonstrated similar signs and symptoms, nor severity. In fact, SARSCoV-2 infection demonstrates a fairly wide spectrum of symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic
cases, to mild respiratory complains, to severe pneumonia, up to severe acute respiratory distress

syndrome (ARDS) (3), up to 10% of cases are on the severe end of the spectrum, suffering in
addition to ARDS multi-organ failure, and requiring mechanical ventilation and/or admission to
intensive care units (ICU) (4).
Critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, particularly interleukin 2 and 6 (IL2, IL6) among others (5), serum levels of such
cytokines -particularly IL6 - were higher compared to patients with milder presentation (6), and
have been associated with increased mortality and poor outcomes (6,7). Such findings, coupled
with post-mortem evidence of severe alveolar edema, patches of inflammatory infiltrates, and
proteinaceous exudates (8), suggest that a cytokine storm secondary to dysregulated immune
response of the host may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (4, 9).
Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized anti-interleukin 6 receptor monoclonal antibody (5), that
targets both forms of receptors namely soluble and membrane bound receptors (10), accordingly it
has been postulated that TCZ treatment may be able to attenuate the so called “cytokine storm”
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prevent the progress of the infection into ARDS (4,
5)
, and it was licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
management of cytokine release syndrome (11). Hence, this study was performed to assess the
impact of treatment with TCZ on critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2, utilizing a composite
outcome measure that is commonly used in critical care studies, ventilator free days (VFD) at 28
days is used to quantify the efficacy of therapies and interventions on morbidity in the presence
of the competing event of death (12, 13). Our hypothesis was that treatment with TCZ would
reduce the composite outcome of VFD.
Objectives:
The primary objective was 28 days VFD as a composite outcome, while secondary outcomes
included components of VFD composite outcome, namely, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality
and actual ventilator free days (aVFD), in addition to positive grown cultures as an adverse
event.
Method:
Study Design:
This was a retrospective observational study that exploited analytical statistical methods to
compare the outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who received TCZ to those who didn’t
during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as a composite outcome of both mortality and duration of
mechanical ventilation.
Setting and timeframe
This study was conducted in the adult ICU of King Saud Medical City (KSMC), the largest
Ministry of Health hospital in the central region of Saudi Arabia. The ICU harbors originally 127
beds, and was expanded during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to include 300 beds, half of which were
isolation single rooms, and the rest were open cohorting areas. It is a closed ICU operated 24/7
by dedicated intensivists, with a nursing ratio of 1:1. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic KSMC

was a COVID referral center, and we generally followed management protocols recommended
by the Ministry of Health, which are an adaptation of international guidelines. This study
included patients admitted to the ICU in the period between March 1st, 2020 and June 30th, 2020.
The analysis included a subset of patients from a previously published article (3).
Inclusion criteria: we included patients if they were admitted to the ICU during the study period,
adults (age ≥ 18), mechanically ventilated upon ICU admission, confirmed COVID-19 positive
(by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab) and received two doses of TCZ during the course of their
treatment. TCZ is given in our ICU in the dose of 4-8 mg/kg, as an intravenous infusion
reconstituted in 100 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution over 60 minutes.
We excluded patients younger than 18 years old, pregnant females, and known pulmonary
tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive cases. Data of all other patients
with the same criteria (apart from receiving TCZ) could be used to identify a control group
(further details follow).
The original study was approved by the local institutional review board (IRB) with waiver of
consent in view of its retrospective design, both studies observe the general principals outlined
by the declaration of Helsinki.
Data management:
We retrieved demographic data of all patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (age, gender,
comorbidities, smoking status, severity score, and body mass index), all included patients must
have been mechanically ventilated upon ICU admission, and we recorded the date of extubation
(if at all) within 28 days, and the ICU outcome as a binary variable of death or survival.
Furthermore, we recorded other modalities of treatment including anti-viral, and steroids.
Finally, we noted reports of positive cultures grown during ICU stay.
Outcomes:
The primary outcome was a composite outcome of VFD, it is a common outcome frequently
utilized in clinical trials in ICU to quantitatively explore the effect of an intervention or treatment
on morbidity in the presence of the competing risk of death (12, 13), details of VFD are given
elsewhere (14), briefly; if the patient within 28 days dies or remains intubated, the outcome is
considered a failure, and the patient is awarded zero aVFD. The outcome is considered a success
only if the patient was extubated before 28 days, and was still alive at day 28, in such case the
aVFD are the days between extubation and day 28. The outcome doesn’t award aVFD if the
patient was re-intubated, or died within 28 days after being extubated. Secondary outcomes
included ICU mortality, and aVFD, in addition to grown cultures (of any source or organism) as
an adverse event that may arise due to the use of TCZ.
Statistical methods:
Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria constituted the intervention group, and we used the
data of all other patients with the same criteria apart from receiving TCZ to identify a control
group, using propensity score matching, we intuitively chose matching criteria of: age, gender,

severity score, comorbidities, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and the receipt of steroids
and antiviral medications. Matching was 1:1 nearest neighbor method with a caliber width of 0.2
without replacement. The reason we didn’t follow the classical method of propensity score
matching where logistic regression is performed using receiving TCZ as the dependent to
identify variables to match upon (15) is that we expected a small number of patients receiving
TCZ with numerous matching criteria so that if all were included in a logistic regression model
would have violated the rule of thumb of 10 events / variable and that would have resulted in
over fitting (16).
Once the matched control group was identified the primary outcome was assessed in a competing
risk regression analysis, utilizing the patients’ status as alive and extubated as the event of
interest, whereas dead or still intubated as the competing risk (14), the primary outcome was
reported as sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) according to Fine and Gray method (17), in this
method the risk of interest and the competing risk are mutually exclusive, that is to say if one
event occurred, the other can’t.
We summarized data of the intervention and control groups by median and interquartile range
(IQR) for continuous variables, and compared them by student t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test
as appropriate. We summarized categorical variables as frequency and percentage, and compared
them by chi2 or Fisher’s exact tests as appropriate. Comparisons were presented with
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p values.
Furthermore, we planned apriori to compare 28-day survival among both groups (regardless of
the mechanical ventilation status) in a Cox Proportional Hazard regression model as a sensitivity
test for the primary outcome, the result of which we presented as p value of log rank test, along
with the corresponding Kaplan Meier curve.
All statistical tests were two sided, considered statistically significant with p value < 0.05,
without correction for multiple testing. Commercially available software STATA® was used in
the analysis (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX:
StataCorp LLC.).
Results:
During the study period seven hundred forty two SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were admitted
to the ICU, out of those four hundred sixty seven patients were intubated and mechanically
ventilated upon ICU admission, we further excluded another fifty two patients (46 younger than
18 years old, 2 pregnant females, 3 known pulmonary tuberculosis, and one known HIV case),
we screened the remaining four hundred fifteen patients and identified 29 patients who received
TCZ according to our ICU protocol, those constituted the intervention group. Out of the three
hundred eighty six patients who didn’t receive TCZ we were able to match 29 patients to
constitute the control group through the previously described propensity score matching method
(Figure 1). Comparison of the demographic and clinical management characteristics of the
intervention group to the unmatched group of mechanically ventilated patients showed
imbalances in age and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores upon ICU admission,
both variables being significantly lower in the unmatched group, those imbalances were

corrected after propensity score matching, and the intervention and control groups had no
statistically significant differences (Table 1).
The primary outcome of our study was the SHR of being alive and extubated at 28 days as the
outcome of interest, in the presence of the competing risk of death or still intubated at 28 days,
our analysis revealed that receiving TCZ results in a statistically significant SHR of 2.7 (95% CI:
1.2 – 6.3; p = 0.02), that is to say increasing the proportional “hazard” of being alive and
extubated at day 28 by 170% compared to patients who didn’t receive TCZ. Our sensitivity
analysis in the form of Cox regression supports our findings, the HR of the Cox regression model
(for the hazard of death) was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.25 – 0.97; log rank p = 0.04). In agreement with
the primary outcome, the result of Cox regression indicates that receiving TCZ reduces the
relative hazard of death by 51% (Table 2). The Kaplan Meier survival curve of both groups is
depicted in figure 2.
The secondary outcomes show that 11 (37.9%) patients in the TCZ group died within 28 days,
while 18 patients (62%) of the control group died within the same period, although numerically
lower the difference in mortality rate between groups was not statistically significant (95% CI of
difference: -3.9% to 48.5%; p = 0.1), all occurrences of death took place in the ICU and none of
the patients was spontaneously breathing at the time of death. The aVFD, however; was
statistically higher in the TCZ group, median (IQR) of aVFD in TCZ group was 10 (0 – 13)
compared to 0 (0 – 2.25) in the control group (mean difference 4.7, 95% CI of difference: 1.1 –
8.3; p = 0.02). In the TCZ group 16 patients (55.2%) have grown positive cultures during the
study period, whereas, only 10 patients (34.5%) in the control group did. The higher rate in TCZ
group was not statistically significant (95% CI of difference: -7.11% to 45.4%; p = 0.1). Table 3
shows the results of secondary outcomes.
Discussion:
In this study 29 mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 positive patients who received TCZ were
compared to a propensity score matched control group of 29 patients with similar characteristics,
the primary outcome was the composite outcome VFD at day 28, it encompasses both duration
of mechanical ventilation and mortality. In our competing risk analysis, receiving TCZ harbored
a statistically significant higher SHR (2.7, 95% CI: 1.2 – 6.3; p = 0.02) of being alive and
extubated at 28 days, compared to those who didn’t receive TCZ. This type of outcome is
common in trials of ARDS in critically ill patients (18-20) due to several advantages, for example it
penalizes mortality making it a plausible trial endpoint, while including the continuous variable
of ventilator days adds to statistical power, in addition to being realistic since a single
intervention in ARDS is unlikely to impact mortality, however; it may shorten the duration of
ventilation if it improves the lung condition, because – as is the case in SARS-CoV-2 infectionARDS is heterogeneous and mortality is usually multi-factorial (14).
To our best knowledge no other study has performed similar competing risk analysis on critically
ill SARS-CoV-2 patients receiving TCZ, however; several studies have demonstrated similar
patterns to our findings, particularly with regards to the components of the primary outcome. In
our study there was an insignificantly lower mortality rate among patients receiving TCZ, this

was also shown by Klopfenstien et al (21) in a retrospective case control study with a similar
sample size, however; studies with larger sample sizes were able to demonstrate a statistically
significant lower mortality rates for patients treated with TCZ (22, 23), which may imply a true
clinical effect on mortality that we were not able to demonstrate statistically due to lack of
power. The second component of the composite outcome (aVFD) in our study was significantly
higher in the TCZ group, confirming our intuition of improving lung condition thus hastening
extubation, which was also demonstrated by others (24).
More recent randomized clinical trials (RCT) explored the outcome of ventilator free days as
well, although in different statistical models. In REMAP-CAP (25) report of the immune module
using Bayesian statistics, respiratory support-free days in TCZ group had a significantly higher
OR compared to control, with > 99.9% of being superior to control. On the contrary, mean and
median ventilator days were not different between TCZ and control groups in two other RCTs (26,
27)
.
The sensitivity analysis in our study seems to be in support of the result of the primary outcome,
and in concordance with many published articles with different designs, showing a statistically
significant HR of survival in Cox regression, and significant log rank p values for TCZ treated
patients (5, 22, 23, 28).
Our adverse event measure was growth of positive cultures of any source and organism, which
we expected in view of the immunomodulatory effect of TCZ, indeed there was a higher rate in
TCZ group, however; it didn’t reach the level of statistical significance. Yet again, in studies
with larger sample size this higher rate of superinfection in TCZ group was shown to be
significant (23, 28) in observational studies, RCTs – however- didn’t show a significant difference
between groups in rate of super-added infection (26,27).
Our study suffers several limitations, first there is the limitation inherent within the retrospective
design and lack of prospective randomization, although propensity score matching partially
compensates this defect. Second, the small sample size in our study definitely renders it
underpowered, and consequently significant findings to be idea generating and should be
interpreted cautiously. Third, we didn’t follow the classical method of propensity score
matching, however; this was for justifiable reasons, and the resultant matched groups were
similar. Last, several details were overlooked in our study, such as the duration of symptoms
before hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and TCZ treatment, since the main focus of the
study was the duration of mechanical ventilation itself and ICU outcome, and those details were
published elsewhere (3).
Conclusion
Mechanically ventilated SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with TCZ may have a better composite
outcome of ventilator free days, TCZ may be associated with significantly longer actual
ventilator free days, but insignificantly lower mortality and superinfection at day 28. Treatment
with TCZ may also be associated with better 28 day survival. These findings need to be
confirmed by larger prospective randomized trials.
