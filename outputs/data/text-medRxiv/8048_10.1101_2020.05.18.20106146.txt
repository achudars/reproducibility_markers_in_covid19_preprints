Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many countries, and in some European

27

countries it has been mitigated since April. Here we applied Richards function to simulate

28

and forecast the course of COVID-19 epidemics in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Turkey,

29

Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland. Potential total COVID-19

30

confirmed cases in these countries were estimated to be 240400±1300, 294100±4000,

31

178500±800, 176900±700, 155400±1000, 57900±400, 24000±200, 46200±300, 30000±300

32

and 30700±100 respectively. Most of these countries are predicted to approach ending

33

stage between late May and early June such that daily new cases will become minimal,

34

which may guide societal and economic restorations. In addition, total COVID-19 deaths

35

were estimated to be 33500 ±300, 28200±200, 27800±200, 8740±80, 4500 ±30, 9250±70,

36

1530±20, 6240±50, 1380±10 and 1960±8, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the

37

first study forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic by applying the Richard function-based

38

regression analysis.

Introduction

41

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has hit many

42

countries [1], resulting in more than 4 million cases and over 300,000 deaths in the world as of

43

May 14, 2020. In European countries such as Italy and Spain, daily new cases are declining

44

since April, yet they are still as many as one thousand per day. In these epidemic-mitigating

45

countries, governments are attempting to restore normal societal and economic activity,

46

however, concerns are raised about the risk of COVID-19 resurgence. It is of significance to

47

precisely forecast when the epidemic in each country will become minimal such that societal

48

and economic restorations will not lead in the resurgence of the outbreak. Further, such

49

forecasting may also inform governments to get better preparedness for making control

50

measures and supplying medical resources. Estimations by traditional epidemiological models

51

apparently require much detailed data for analysis [2, 3]. Here we applied a simple data-driven,

52

Richards function-based approach for epidemic forecasting only based on the daily cumulative

53

confirmed COVID-19 cases. This approach has been explored for simulating 2003 SARS

54

outbreaks in several regions/countries by others [4, 5] and also for estimating COVID-19 deaths

55

in China by us recently [6].

Methods

58

The Richards function is expressed as follows [4, 5]:

59

y=a*(1+(d-1)*exp((x-xc)*k))^(1/(1-d))

60

where y is the daily cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and x is day; a, d, xc and

61

k are constants. Specifically, total number of COVID-19 cases are given by parameter a in the

62

equation. Simulation was performed using Microcal Origin software with the Richard function.

63

Results

64

Estimation of potential total COVID-19 confirmed cases

65

We decided to collect the data of the cumulative confirmed cases from the website of

66

Worldometer [7] for 10 most affected and epidemic-mitigating European countries, i.e., Italy,

67

Spain, France, Germany, Turkey, Belgium, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland (for

68

detail, refer to the supporting information file original data.xlsx). Regression analyses indicate

69

that the data of each country were well fitted with the Richards function (all R2 values being

70

close to 0.999; Table 1 and Figure 1). Potential total numbers of confirmed cases in the above

71

countries were estimated to be 240400±1300, 294100±4000, 178500±800, 176900±700,

72

155400±1000, 57900±400, 24000±200, 46200±300, 30000±300 and 30700±100 respectively.

73

All parameters from regression analyses are presented in Table S1 and can be utilized to predict

74

daily new cases in each country since May 15 according to equation 1.

75
76

In addition, we estimated the key date, on which daily new cases are lower than 0.1% of the

77

potential total confirmed cases as defined by us subjectively. It appears that most countries will

78

approach such late stage between late May and early June (refer to Table 1) such that daily new

79

cases will become minimal in comparison with potential total confirmed cases. In our opinion,

80

nationwide societal and economic restorations should be initiated at least not earlier than the

81

estimated key dates, although local restorations may be operated earlier according to the local

82

epidemic situation.

83

Estimation of potential total COVID-19 deaths

84

In several countries, crude fatality ratios are as high as over 10% such that people have raised

85

grave concerns about how many patients will die eventually. Assuming that the number of

86

deaths is proportional to the number of confirmed cases for the COVID-19 outbreak under

87

specific circumstances, we speculated that the cumulative COVID-19 deaths would also obey

88

the Richards function. Regression analyses indicate that the data of cumulative COVID-19

89

deaths in each country were well fitted with the Richards function (all R2 values being close to

90

0.999; Table 1 and Figure 2). All parameters of regression analyses are displayed in Table S2

91

and can be utilized to predict daily new deaths in each country since May 15 according to

92

equation 1. Potential total COVID-19 deaths in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Turkey, Belgium,

Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland were estimated to be 33500 ±300, 28200±200,

94

27800±200, 8740±80, 4500 ±30, 9250±70, 1530±20, 6240±50, 1380±10 and 1960±8,

95

respectively. Crude fatality ratios (total deaths among total confirmed cases) of these countries

96

could be estimated to be 13.9±0.9%, 9.6±0.9%, 15.6±0.7%, 4.9±0.9%. 2.9±0.7%, 16.0±0.9%,

97

6.4±1.3%, 13.5±0.9%, 4.6±0.8% and 6.4±0.4%, respectively.

Discussion

100

To our best knowledge, this is the first study forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic by applying

101

the Richard function-based regression analysis. It should be pointed out that all the above

102

estimates are based on the assumption that there are no significant changes regarding the current

103

interventions, including non-pharmacological interventions such as quarantine and other

104

prevention measures and also diagnosis and treatment approaches. In addition, UK and Sweden,

105

two most affected European countries with more than 240,000 and 29,000 COVID-19

106

confirmed cases as of May 15 , respectively, were not subjected to analysis because their daily

107

new cases have not yet started to significantly decline (Figure. S1).

108
109

Collectively, our forecasting on the course of COVID-19 outbreaks in these European countries

110

may provide valuable guidance for governments and also the public to get better preparedness

111

and optimize their efforts to contain this unprecedented crisis at current critical stage. The

112

estimated key date for each country may serve as a reference for operating societal and

113

economic restorations such that the resurgence of COVID-19 can be avoided, minimized or

114

under control according to COVID-19 containment in China [8, 9]. In addition, because

115

thousands of COVID-19 patients have died in these countries, our prediction on the course of

116

COVID-19 deaths (refer to Figure 2 and Table S2) may benefit the mental health service that

117

needs to be timely provided to the families of passed patients [10]. As a matter of fact, we

118

precisely estimated total COVID-19 deaths in different areas of China (including Hubei

119

Province and Wuhan city, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreaks in China [1]) by applying

120

both Boltzmann and Richards functions-based regression analyses [6]. Such estimation help

121

governments to evaluate the severity of the COVID-19 epidemics.
