Abstract

13

Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic overwhelms Japan’s

14

intensive care capacity. This study aimed to determine the number of patients with

15

COVID-19 who required intensive care and to compare the numbers with Japan’s

16

intensive care capacity.

17

Methods: Publically available datasets were used to obtain the number of confirmed

18

patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane

19

oxygenation (ECMO) between February 15 and July 19, 2020, to determine and compare

20

intensive care unit (ICU) and attending bed needs for patients with COVID-19, and to

21

estimate peak ICU demands in Japan.

22

Results: During the epidemic peak in late April, 11443 patients (1.03/10000 adults) had

23

been infected, 373 patients (0.034/10000 adults) were in ICU, 312 patients (0.028/10000

24

adults) were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056/10000 adults) were

25

under ECMO per day. At the peak of the epidemic, the number of infected patients was

26

651% of designated beds, and the number of patients requiring intensive care was 6.0% of

27

ICU beds, 19.1% of board-certified intensivists, and 106% of designated medical

28

institutions in Japan.

29

Conclusions: The number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 continued to rise

30

during the pandemic, exceeding the number of designated beds but not exceeding ICU

31

capacity.

Introduction

33

A novel coronavirus, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

34

CoV-2), was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and the number of newly

35

reported cases has continued to increase globally. As of September 2020, >34 million cases

36

had been reported worldwide and >1000000 people had died [1], with >84000 reported

37

cases and >1500 deaths recorded in Japan. On January 30, 2020, the World Health

38

Organization (WHO) declared the epidemic to be a "public health emergency of

39

international concern". On April 7, 2020, Japan declared a state of emergency in seven

40

major central cities, which then was extended to all 47 prefectures on April 16, 2020 [2].

41

COVID-19 affects the respiratory system and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 suffer

42

from respiratory syndromes [3]. Although approximately 70-80% of patients with COVID-

43

19 have mild to moderate symptoms and recover, 5-20% of patients develop severe

44

respiratory failure and may require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) [3-5].

45

Symptomatic treatment for severe respiratory failure has involved the use of mechanical

46

ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [5-9] although there are

47

candidate drugs available to treat severe patients with COVID-19 as of September 2020

48

[10,11]; remdesivir [12,13] and dexamethasone [14]. One study that analyzed clinical cases

49

of COVID-19 reported a better prognosis in patients with a mild infection, whereas the

50

prognosis for patients with severe and critical infections is poor. However, patients

51

presenting with mild infection are less obvious and are less easily located or identified [15].

52

A previous observational study reported that approximately 50% of the patients admitted to

53

ICU required ventilation support and, of these, one in four patients required considerably

54

greater levels of intensive life support [15]. A cohort study found that approximately 8% of

55

patients with COVID-19 were critically ill [16]. One case series reported that, of 18 patients

56

who required intubation, 1 patient required ECMO and 5 patients died [17]. It has been

57

estimated that, despite intensive life support, approximately 3-4% of all infected patients

58

are likely to die due to SARS-CoV-2 infection [3,18].

59

The importance of ICUs during the COVID-19 pandemic has been well established;

60

however, ICU capacity concerning expected numbers of patients with COVID-19 requiring

61

intensive care is unknown. During the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a dramatic

62

surge in the number of critically ill patients with an urgent need for ICU admission [19], as

63

occurred in other natural disasters [20,21]. An analysis of the epidemic peak in Wuhan

64

indicated that the number of severely and critically ill adult patients requiring intensive care

65

was estimated to be 12.2/10000 and 2.6/10000, respectively [22]. However, this situation

66

differs between countries, and specific data sourced in terms of Japanese circumstances are

67

needed [23]. This study aimed to determine the number of critically ill patients who

68

required ICU admission, including the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation

69

and ECMO, and to compare these patient numbers with ICU capacity in Japan at

70

nationwide and regional levels.

77

Infectious disease data source

78

We obtained data concerning numbers of infected, recovered, and dead patients due to

79

COVID-19 in Japan from a publicly available website [24]. The number of patients who

80

required mechanical ventilation and ECMO support was extracted from the Japanese

81

Society of Intensive Care Medicine (JSICM) website [23,25]. This database accumulates

82

data using a CRoss Icu Searchable Information System (CRISIS). More than 570 facilities

83

across Japan currently participate in this CRISIS, centering on facilities certified by the

84

JSICM and facilities designated by the Japanese Society of Emergency Medicine, with a

85

total of 5500 ICU beds, covering 80% of the total ICU beds in Japan [26]. This database

86

provides information concerning the number of patients under mechanical ventilation,

87

under ECMO, the number of patients in recovery from ECMO, and the number of patients

88

who died during ECMO.

89
90

Intensive care unit capacity data source

91

We extracted the number of ICU beds (n = 7109) and board-certified intensivists (n = 1957)

92

from the JSICM website. This website has also reported the estimated number of

93

mechanical ventilators for adults (n = 30091) and ECMO machines (n = 2208) in Japan

94

(table 1) [27].

95

In Japan, COVID-19 was designated as an infectious disease under the Infectious Diseases

96

Control Law on January 28, 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were admitted and transferred

97

to designated medical institutions responsible for the hospitalization of patients with a

98

Category II infectious disease (especially tuberculosis) or a novel influenza infection.

99

Although clear evidence of person-to-person airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not

100

been established, an airborne component of transmission is likely, based on other

101

respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East

102

respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza [28-31] and its presence in aerosol has been

103

confirmed at RNA level [32,33]. Many infectious control guidelines recommend that

104

healthcare workers be protected through the use of personal protective equipment [34-36].

105

Suspicious airborne infectious routes make patient care difficult and complex, requiring the

106

management of the patient using airborne precautions [37] or management of the patient in

107

a depressurized area [36]. A patient management ratio of one critically ill patient to one

108

depressurized area per hospital has been used, assuming that not all infected patients could

109

be treated in ICU beds. In Japan, there are 1758 beds designated for patients with a

110

Category II infectious disease, 3502 beds allocated for patients with tuberculosis, and 351

111

designated medical institutions for patients with Category II infectious diseases (table 1)

112

[38].

113

ECMO is a highly integrated critical care treatment that requires multidisciplinary team

114

collaboration [39,40]. It is also assumed that not all of the ECMO machines in Japan could

115

be allocated to manage critically ill patients with COVID-19. In Japan, an organized

116

ECMO-based respiratory program, namely, the ECMO project [41], comprises a

117

consortium of specialized institutions for ECMO involving the participation of 100

118

hospitals in this project. We assumed these hospitals were the institutions specially

dedicated to treating critically ill patients with COVID-19 who required treatment using

120

ECMO machines (table 1) [41].

121
122

Board-certified intensivists and patient numbers in ICUs in seven regions in Japan

123

according to the JSICM and CRISIS

124

Data concerning population numbers in Japan in 2019 at nationwide and regional levels and

125

the proportion of adults aged ≥15 years were retrieved from the Statistics Bureau of Japan

126

[42]. The national population was 1.26 ×108 and the proportion of adults was 87.9%. To

127

determine regional differences, we analyzed the demand and supply of ICUs in the 47

128

prefectures. The JSICM and CRISIS have reported the number of board-certified

129

intensivists and the number of patients in ICU in seven regions in Japan, namely,

130

Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto-Koshinetsu, Tokai-Hokuriku, Kansai, Chugoku-Shikoku, and

131

Kyusyu-Okinawa (figure 1). Data concerning the 47 prefectures were then integrated

132

according to these seven regions (table 1).

133
134

Statistical analysis

135

The total number of patient days in ICU was summed to estimate the total number of ICU

136

days and the raw number of patients in ICU on each day was plotted [22]. The notation

137

“critical case” denoted the total number of patients on mechanical ventilator and ECMO.

138

The proportion of critically ill patients per 10000 adults was estimated based on the number

139

presented in the infectious diseases and ICU capacity data source sections.

Results

142

COVID-19 accounted for a total of 21705 ICU days, 18495 mechanical ventilation days,

143

and 3210 ECMO days between January 15, 2020, and July 19, 2020, with a median

144

(interquartile range [IQR]) of 96 (68-197) patients in ICU, 83 (58-174) patients on

145

mechanical ventilation, and 15 (11-27) patients on ECMO machines each day during these

146

156 days (figure 2 and table 2). During the peak of the epidemic in late April 2020, 11443

147

patients (1.03 per 10000 adults) had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and, of these, 373

148

patients (0.034 per 10000 adults) were admitted to ICU, 312 patients (0.028 per 10000

149

adults) were treated using mechanical ventilation, and 62 patients (0.0056 per 10000 adults)

150

were treated using ECMO machines per day.

151

The number of infected patients at the peak of the epidemic was 651% of total designated

152

beds for Category II infectious disease and 218% of total Category II with tuberculosis

153

beds, and the number of patients requiring intensive care at the peak of the epidemic was

154

6.0% of total ICU beds in Japan, 19.1% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan, and

155

106% of total Category II institutions. The number of patients requiring ECMO at the peak

156

of the epidemic was 3.2% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan, 17.7% of total

157

Category II institutions, and 62% of total hospitals participating in ECMO project in Japan,

158

respectively (figure 2 and table 3).

159

The number of total ICU days was 1766 (IQR, 8-13) in Hokkaido, 200 (0-2) days in

160

Tohoku, 11805 (40-106) days in Kanto-Koshinetsu, 1318 (5-12) days in Tokai-Hokuriku,

161

4587 (6-48) days in Kansai, 367 (0-3) days in Chugoku-Shikoku, and 1662 (1-17) days in

162

Kyusyu-Okinawa (figure 3 and table 2).

163

ICU demand compared with the proportion of board-certified intensivists greatly increased

164

in Hokkaido (37.3% of total board-certified intensivists in Hokkaido), in Kanto-Koshinetsu

165

(26.7%), and Kansai (27.7%) compared with the overall demand in Japan (19.1%). ICU

166

and mechanical ventilation demand overwhelmed the number of Category II institutions in

167

Hokkaido (117% of total Category II institutions of ICU and 108% of total Category II

168

institutions for mechanical ventilation), in Kanto-Koshinetsu (213% for ICU and 176% for

169

mechanical ventilation), and Kansai (262% for ICU and 241% for mechanical ventilation)

170

(table 3). The number of patients requiring ECMO compared with the number of ECMO

171

project hospitals was 125% in Hokkaido and 106% in Kanto-Koshinetsu (figure 4 and table

172

3).

173
174

Discussion

175

The number of new patients diagnosed with COVID-19 continues to increase globally.

176

Approximately 70-80% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show mild to moderate

177

respiratory symptoms; however, between 5% and 32% of these patients may develop severe

178

symptoms and require ICU admission, of whom between 3% and 22% may require

179

mechanical ventilation and between 0.5% and 5% may require oxygenation with ECMO

180

[3,4,15,37,43-45]. Depending on the efficacy of infection control strategies, a shortage of

181

ICU ventilators may or may not eventuate [41].

182

Exceeding hospital bed capacity would likely increase the community spread of SARS-

183

CoV-2 and lead to decreased quality of healthcare and intensive care [22]. In China,

184

national lockdown, quarantine, and social distancing measures were adopted to control the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136150; this version posted October 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

185

spread of infection, with >10000 beds designated for the isolation and treatment of patients

186

with confirmed COVID-19 by early February 2020 [22]. Despite these efforts to control the

187

spread of infection, this did not lead to an immediate downturn in demand for

188

hospitalization in critical care units and ICUs in China [22], and this situation has been

189

similar in Japan.

190

Our results indicated a critical need to isolate and treat patients with COVID-19; however,

191

while there remained a small margin for critically ill patients requiring mechanical

192

ventilation and ECMO in terms of ICU capacity, this situation was sub-optimal. Intensivists

193

do not necessarily attend to all critically ill patients and have been reported to provide care

194

to only 37% of all ICU patients [46]. In the United States, one study reported that only

195

approximately 30% of intensive care units were staffed by dedicated intensivists [47]. Due

196

to different health care systems, statistics from the United States model could not be simply

197

extrapolated to Japan, but we have assumed that these percentages are likely to be the same

198

or no greater in Japan. The number of critically ill patients in ICU at the peak of the

199

epidemic accounted for 19% of total board-certified intensivists in Japan, which challenged

200

Japan’s ICU capacity.

201

Our findings also showed a regional bias in terms of ICUs being overwhelmed in Japan.

202

Kanto-Koshinetsu and Kansai are the biggest regions in Japan. The Kanto-Koshinetsu

203

region includes Japan’s capital city, Tokyo, which is the most populous prefecture and also

204

includes Kanagawa, which is the second most populous prefecture. The Kansai region

205

includes Osaka, which is the third most populous prefecture. A large population and the

206

movement of people to and from these regions is thought to have spread the infection,

207

which resulted in medical capacity becoming overwhelmed. Hokkaido, the largest

208

prefecture in Japan, had an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 in the early

209

phase of the epidemic. Epidemiological evidence to explain this phenomenon remains

210

limited. Before the administration's state of emergency declaration, the local government in

211

Hokkaido issued its emergency declaration on February 28, 2020, to control the spread of

212

infection [48].

213

ECMO management in Japanese hospitals has previously resulted in poorer outcomes [49]

214

compared with those reported in other countries during the N1H1 influenza epidemic

215

[39,50-54]. There is a wide consensus that ECMO treatment should be performed at centers

216

with high case volumes and established protocols, and involving clinicians who are

217

experienced in its use. Patients who require ECMO treatment should be transferred to

218

appropriate ECMO centers [39,40,49,54]. Japan has introduced an ECMO project [41] and

219

the ECMOnet [23,25], which involve a consortium working to promote the appropriate use

220

of ECMO, to help develop an evidence-based foundation for its use, to strive for continuous

221

improvement in its application where appropriate, and to collect data concerning the

222

number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ECMO support [55,56]. There are

223

>2000 ECMO machines available for use in Japan. The number of patients requiring

224

ECMO was 3.2% of all ECMO machines at the peak of the epidemic, but the capacity

225

levels in terms of use should not be overestimated. In terms of the hospitals participating in

226

the ECMO project in Japan, the number of patients requiring ECMO was 62% of their

227

work at the peak of the epidemic, which is likely to provide a more realistic estimate of

228

their intensive care capacity.

229

Our study had several limitations. First, the number of critically ill patients requiring

230

intensive care was not completely addressed in the JSICM database. This database has been

231

estimated to capture >80% of clinical cases [25,26]; however, it relies heavily on the

232

cooperation of physicians struggling to treat large numbers of critically ill patients.

233

Second, the extent of the ICU capacity and the number of patients requiring admission to

234

ICUs were not completely validated. The JSICM reported the estimated number of

235

ventilators and ECMO machines according to responses to a questionnaire sent to its

236

member hospitals. Therefore, there was a risk of overestimating ICU capacity. Third, the

237

assumption of one critically ill patient to one depressurized area per hospital did not

238

necessarily reflect the real-life situation. For example, one author’s institution was

239

designated as a Category II infectious diseases institution with eight ICU beds, one

240

depressurized area, and six Category II beds, with one board-certified intensivist. This

241

institution was not a member of the ECMO project. Six Category II beds were fully

242

occupied as soon as the number of infected patients threatened to overwhelm the capacity

243

of the ICU, and other wards were then rearranged to manage patients with mild

244

manifestations of COVID-19. There were two alternatives to treat critically ill patients with

245

COVID-19: one was to use an ICU depressurized bed, and the other was to rearrange the

246

beds in the emergency department. The latter option was chosen because other critically ill

247

and surgical patients could not be treated in the ICU when occupied by patients with

248

COVID-19 for fear of airborne transmissions. Most hospitals are thought to have flexibly

249

employed a variety of methods to increase their capacity to treat patients with COVID-19.

251

Conclusions

252

During the COVID-19 pandemic and following the state of emergency declaration in Japan,

253

the number of patients threatened to overwhelm the number of beds designated for

254

infectious patients; however, Japan’s ICU capacity was sufficient to withstand the demands

255

for mechanical ventilation and ECMO. However, there is no room for complacency in this

256

situation. Urgent consideration is needed concerning future planning concerning how to

257

mitigate the threat to providing intensive care for critically ill patients with COVID-19 at

258

domestic and regional levels in Japan.
