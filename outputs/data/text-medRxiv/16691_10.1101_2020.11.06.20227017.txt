Abstract
Background:
In view of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, mass drug administration interventions
for neglected tropical diseases, including lymphatic filariasis, have been halted. We used
mathematical modelling to estimate the impact of delaying or cancelling treatment rounds
and explore possible mitigation strategies.
Methods:
We used three established lymphatic filariasis transmission models to simulate infection
trends in settings with annual treatment rounds and programme delays in 2020 of 6, 12, 18
or 24 months. We then evaluated the impact of various mitigation strategies upon
resuming activities.
Results:
The delay in achieving the elimination goals is on average similar to the number of years
the treatment rounds are missed. Enhanced interventions implemented for as little as one
year can allow catch-up on the progress lost, and if maintained throughout the programme
can lead to acceleration of up to 3 years.
Conclusions:
In general, a short delay in the programme does not cause major delay in achieving the
goals. Impact is strongest in high endemicity areas. Mitigation strategies such as biannual
treatment or increased coverage are key to minimizing the impact of the disruption once
the programme resumes; and lead to potential acceleration, should these enhanced
strategies be maintained.

Introduction
Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a disease caused by parasitic filarial worms, was identified as
potentially eradicable in 1993 1. It has been targeted for elimination as a public health
problem by the World Health Organization (WHO), with initial goals set for 2020, which are
now being revised for 20202. The main strategy to achieve elimination as a public health
problem is through mass drug administration (MDA). The most common drug
combinations used by the LF control and elimination programmes is either a combination
of diethylcarbamazine citrate and albendazole (DA), or ivermectin and albendazole (IA) in
areas where onchocerciasis is endemic. Geographically, this means that IA is used in
most of Africa, while DA is used in other parts of the world, such as the Indian
subcontinent. Currently, MDA programmes are ongoing in 46 countries 3.
Mass drug administration campaigns are generally carried out annually, for a minimum of
five years (5 rounds), with the aim of achieving at least 65% coverage. Afterwards, a
series of transmission assessment surveys must reveal low likelihood of current
transmission to achieve elimination as a public health problem. This is generally
associated to reaching a threshold of 1% microfilaria (mf) prevalence, or 2% antigenemia
prevalence, in areas where the dominant vector for transmission is Anopheles or Culex
(0.5% mf threshold used in areas with Aedes-transmitted LF)4.
The current global COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact world-wide, with over 10
million confirmed cases in the first half of 2020 and over half a million deaths. This impact
is compounded by its indirect effects on other diseases and health programmes. In view of
the current global COVID-19 pandemic, and the need to practice physical distancing,
WHO issued the recommendation on 1 April 2020 to put all community-based surveys,
active case-finding activities and mass treatment campaigns for neglected tropical
diseases on hold until further notice5. For the LF control and elimination programmes
which had an MDA round planned, it has meant a stop of all activities. It thus becomes
important to assess the impact of delays in the MDA delivery on the 2030 goals, and to
consider strategies to strengthen programmes after the lockdown to mitigate the negative
impact of disruption.
Strategies have been considered for accelerating progress towards the 2020 goals (now
2030) which could be used as mitigation strategies, such as biannual rounds of treatment
or increased coverage6–8. Recent clinical trials and mathematical modelling studies have
shown that the combination of all three drugs, commonly known as the triple drug (IDA),
can substantially improve progress towards the goal 7,9–13. The use of IDA has been
recommended by WHO to accelerate global elimination efforts 14. However, only countries
without onchocerciasis can deploy IDA in their programmes, due to risks of adverse
events.
A suite of three different mathematical models have been recently used to compare
strategies to accelerate global elimination of LF 7, as well as to assess the likelihood of
resurgence after reaching the 1% mf prevalence threshold 8. Those same models are used
here to: 1) estimate the impact of MDA delays in the expected progress towards the 1% mf
threshold, 2) establish mitigation strategies that are sufficient to catch-up the
missed/delayed rounds, and 3) assess the acceleration provided from mitigation strategies
that can be maintained longer term. Mitigation and acceleration strategies considered here
include enhancing coverage from 65% to 80%, deploying the treatment twice per year
(biannual treatment), and, for areas using DA, the benefit of switching to the triple drug.

Employed mathematical models
We used three well-described published mathematical models for LF transmission to
enhance our understanding of the disruption caused by COVID-19 to ongoing control and
elimination efforts. We included the following models, developed and applied by members
of the Neglected Tropical Disease Modeling Consortium: EPIFIL 15,16, a deterministic
population-based model; and LYMFASIM 17,18 and TRANSFIL19,20, both stochastic individual
based models. All models capture the basic processes relevant to the transmission
dynamics of LF, including parasite life cycle, vector density and biting rate, and human
exposure to the vectors. The formulation and parametrization of these models is detailed
in the references above, see supplementary material for an updated implementation of the
three models.
Scenarios considered
Countries may be at different stages in their control programme. In this analysis, we
assumed that two annual MDA rounds achieving 65% coverage were completed before
the interruption caused by COVID-19 (disruptions at other points in the programme yield
broadly similar results and are discussed in the supplementary material, page 2). Two
settings were considered, one relevant for most of Africa, with Anopheles-driven
transmission and annual treatment with IA; and a second representing India-like
populations, with Culex-driven transmission and treatment with DA. The assumptions of
drug effectiveness, in terms of macro and microfilaricidal effect and sterilization of adult
worms, was taken from Stolk, Prada et al. 7, see also supplementary material (page 4).
Vector control is commonly recommended to enhance MDA, but is generally outside the
control of the LF programmes. To be conservative, we considered that there was no
bednet coverage, while we acknowledge that bednet coverage is present in many African
areas21. Additional simulations considering bednets and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are
shown in the supplementary materials (page 3).
To assess the impact of delayed MDA, we explored four scenarios where the MDA rounds
are postponed either 6, 12, 18 or 24 months, which causes a gap of one and a half, two,
two and a half, and three years respectively, Figure 1. A 6 month interruption represents
one postponed round and 12 or 24 month interruptions would represent one or two
cancelled rounds respectively, whereas an 18 month interruption represents one delayed
and one postponed round.
To manage and minimize the impact of the delay in delivering the next round of MDA,
national programmes could implement alternative enhanced strategies after resuming
activities. Here, we explored the impact of various MDA-based mitigation strategies,
namely i) enhanced achieved coverage (up from 65% to 80%); ii) switching to biannual
rounds, treating every six months; and iii) in areas where appropriate (here our India-like
setting), the deployment of the triple drug. In all simulated scenarios, MDA continues until
the 1% mf threshold is achieved, up to 2045 (end of simulation window).
Analysis of simulation results
We generated a large number of simulations (simulation bank) and extracted uniformly
10,000 runs per scenario, for each model, across a wide range of baseline prevalence
(assumed to be in 2018), from 1% to 40%. All simulations across the three models are
considered as an ensemble, with equal weighting. We projected forward from the baseline
under the different treatment regimes in each scenario and extracted the simulated mf
prevalence in the population, each year. We summarized some results following a general
classification of low, medium and high prevalence areas, these were mapped to the noncontiguous microfilaria prevalence of 5-10%, 15-20% and 25-30% respectively. To select

the simulations for each prevalence bracket, we extracted 1,000 runs from each model
uniformly from the simulation bank.
We used a counterfactual no disruption scenario (i.e. the initial five rounds take place as
expected, Figure 1), to assess for how long the enhanced strategies need to be
implemented in order to catch up with the expected progress of the programme. We
calculated the year in which the prevalence in the different interventions is equal or below
the counterfactual scenario, as that would indicate that the enhanced strategy managed to
mitigate the disruption caused by the gap in treatment, see Figure 2 for an illustrative
example. After the initial 5 year programme, we assume that the treatment strategy used
after resuming activities is continued until the 1% mf threshold is met. We can then use
these same runs to quantify the gains should these alternative strategies be maintained
beyond catching up, see Figure 2. To summarize results over the prevalence range, we
calculated the moving average with a window size of 4,000 and the volatility as the
unweighted standard deviation in the same window size.
Results
The expected delay in reaching the 1% mf threshold is broadly similar across the baseline
prevalence (here considered in 2018), Figure 3 - top. Across the full baseline prevalence
range explored, the delay in reaching the 1% goal (and thus the increase in the length of
the programme that needs to be considered) is estimated to be on average slightly less
than the delay of the MDA round. For example, a one year delay in distributing the MDA
round causes on average almost one year delay in the Culex, DA setting and a bit less
than a one year delay in the Anopheles, IA setting, Figure 3 - top. Areas with prevalence
below 5% are close to the goal, and thus the disruption is minimal. The proportion missing
the 2030 goal is estimated to increase faster in Anopheles settings than in Culex settings
as baseline prevalence increases, Figure 3 - bottom.
A summary of the results across the four delays we considered, for the two settings, is
shown in Table 1. The focus here are the low, medium and high prevalence areas, as
defined above (5-10%, 15-20% and 25-30% mf prevalence respectively). Low prevalence
areas, irrespective of the delay considered, are on average likely to reach 1% mf before
the 2030 endpoint, however delays in medium and high prevalence areas may require
programmes to continue beyond 2030. Across the two settings and the prevalence
brackets considered, a 6 month delay in the deployment of the MDA will lead on average
to the programme not needing to be extended beyond the originally planned timelines,
Table 1.
Alternative enhanced strategies, such as increasing efforts to achieve a higher coverage
or increasing the treatment frequency can help catch-up to the time lost due to the COVID19 disruption. Biannual rounds of MDA or switching to IDA, where possible, are on
average faster methods to catch up than achieving a high coverage of 80%, Figure 4.
Longer gaps in the programme would require more rounds of the enhanced campaigns to
catch up, see supplementary materials (page 5).
Maintaining the strategies implemented to catch-up and mitigate the disruption caused by
COVID-19 will lead to acceleration of the programmes, irrespective of the strategy used,
Figure 5. A long disruption causing a two years delay (a three year gap between treatment
rounds), can be caught up by these alternative strategies. All three strategies considered
here (80% coverage achieved, biannual rounds or switching to IDA where possible), lead
to qualitatively similar gains, Figure 5, which could be as big as reaching the goal three
years earlier. The results shown here are for an India-like setting, with Culex as the

dominant vector and the deployment of DA as the drug combination, results for
Anopheles-transmitted setting, treated with IA, are broadly similar, see supplementary
material (page 6).
Discussion
We have estimated the delays in LF elimination efforts due to the disruption caused by
COVID-19, in two broadly defined settings, using three well-established mathematical
models of lymphatic filariasis transmission 7,8. Moreover, we explored how alternative
enhanced strategies could be used to catch-up and recover from the disruption when
programmes resume, and potentially accelerate progress towards the 2030 goals, if
maintained longer term.
Overall, our simulations suggest that each round missed generally extends the programme
by the same amount, Figure 3, provided programmes can resume activities achieving
similar levels of coverage as before the disruption. As an example, a programme that
misses one round this year, and resumes their MDA campaigns next year, is likely to be
one year behind, although in some cases it could lead to longer delays, Figure 3 / Table 1.
Moreover, baseline prevalence has a very limited effect on the delays, as seen in Figure 3,
with the exception of very low prevalence areas (<5% mf). However, the estimated time to
reach 1% mf prevalence has a larger uncertainty in high prevalence areas, Table 1. These
results are consistent across the two settings considered (Anopheles dominated
transmission with IA-based MDA and Culex dominated transmission with DA-based MDA).
Medium (15-20% mf), and high (25-30% mf) prevalence areas are more at risk of missing
the 2030 target, should the delays not be mitigated. In low prevalence areas (as defined
above, 5-10% mf in 2018), a two-year delay (three-year gap between treatment rounds),
could lead in some extreme cases to missing the 2030 goal, Table 1. However, we expect
that on average those areas, or those with even lower baseline prevalence, will reach the
2030 goals ahead of time, in spite of the COVID-19 disruption. In page 2 of the
supplementary materials we show that results for programmes that started earlier/later
their MDA are qualitatively similar.
Encouragingly, interventions that are commonly considered to accelerate progress
towards the goals, such as increased coverage or frequency of the interventions 7, can also
be used to mitigate the impact of the missed rounds. A 6-month delay in the MDA
programme, effectively deploying two MDA rounds 6 months apart, see Figure 1, is similar
to resuming activities with a biannual strategy, where one year is sufficient to catch up to
the expected progress of the programme in the absence of any delays, Figure 4. These
results highlight the importance of implementing the missed round as soon as possible
when it is safe to do so, which would also prevent the expiry of medication already
stocked. Should these enhanced strategies be maintained, once the programmes resume
activities, until the 1% mf threshold is reached, as much as three years could be gained,
Figure 5. Our models predict that the extended use of these enhanced strategies will
ensure that even high prevalence areas will be able to reach the 2030 targets.
Our analysis has a number of assumptions and simplifications that need to be considered.
While we allow parameter uncertainty in the inputs (see supplementary material), and for
LYMFASIM and TRANSFIL, stochastic effects, we do not account for sampling of the
human population, and thus the mf is the true value in the population over 5 years
(minimum age to be included in a survey). Similarly, the deployment of the drug and its
effect takes place within one time-step of the model (two weeks/one month depending on
the model). This, combined with the assumption that compliance (the proportion of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.20227017; this version posted November 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this

individuals treated in two consecutive rounds) is the same between biannual rounds as
between annual rounds, means that our results for biannual treatment might be slightly
optimistic. We have conducted a sensitivity analysis for other simplifications, such as the
effect of vector control and the disruption occurring at a different point in the programme,
see supplementary materials (pages 2-3).
For our analysis, we have assumed that the programmes can resume MDA activities with
a similar coverage as before the disruption. In previous occasions where MDA has been
interrupted, programmes have reported good coverage the following years after resuming
activities. In Haiti, following the 2010 earthquake, there was a 92% reported coverage of
MDA for LF in 2011, which was calculated from the doses administered and estimated
population sizes; a household survey in Port-au-Prince the same year reported a coverage
of 71%22. Similarly, the Sierra Leone and Liberia LF programmes missed MDA in 2014 due
to the West Africa Ebola epidemic23, but both managed to resume in 2015 and report
>70% coverage24,25. However, whilst Guinea reported a 16% coverage achieved during the
outbreak, this only increased to 21% in 2015; while by 2016 coverage was reported up to
73%26. Unfortunately, there is little information available on how these interruptions
affected program outcomes, as the majority are still undertaking MDA, but by 2019, 9 of 14
districts in Sierra Leone had stopped MDA27.
One important aspect to consider, which we currently do not capture in our models, is that
a delay in meeting the 1% mf elimination as a public health threshold could cause higher
morbidity levels while transmission is ongoing. This may lead to new incident cases of
morbidity, especially in areas that have not started MDA yet or with a relatively recent
start. Even when implementing catch up strategies, the time spent with a higher
prevalence than originally planned will undoubtedly lead to higher morbidity in the affected
communities. Moreover, morbidity management measures to relieve the suffering of those
affected by hydrocele or lymphoedema may also be disrupted. Hydrocele operations will
likely be delayed. Management of lymphoedema might perhaps continue, as it is
commonly managed at home, although disruptions might make this more difficult.
Therefore, it is not only important to mitigate the disruption, but also to do it quickly.
In summary, progress towards the LF 2030 goals is not going to be greatly affected by the
COVID-19 disruption, if the interruption remains restricted to 6-24 months, especially if
mitigation strategies are put in place. These enhanced strategies that will allow catching
up are not particularly novel, and have been discussed and considered recently for
accelerating progress towards the 2030 goals. An opportunity could be present for
programmes that resume MDA using one of these mitigation strategies, particularly those
that recently started, as it will lead to a faster reduction in microfilaria prevalence, and
lower morbidity, should the strategies be maintained until the 1% mf threshold is met.

baseline (assumed here in 2018), for setting with Culex transmission treated with DA. Topleft plot compares the counterfactual to the no mitigation scenario (after a 12 month delay).
The rest of the plots show the different acceleration strategies (in colour) against the no
mitigation situation (in grey). Horizontal dashed line indicates the year 2030, areas that go
above 2030 are unlikely to reach the goal. Solid line shows the moving average (window
size of 4000), shaded area is the standard deviation (volatility).
Table 1. Estimated timeline to achieving 1% mf prevalence goal by baseline endemicity,
mean in years (95%CI), and estimated extension of the programmes required (i.e. delay to
reaching 1% mf) for different delays in the deployment of the next MDA. Timeframes over
12 years from the baseline are beyond 2030, and thus are estimated to miss the goal.
