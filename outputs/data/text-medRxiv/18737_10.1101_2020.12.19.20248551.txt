ABSTRACT
COVID-19 patients elicit strong responses to the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2
but binding antibodies are also detected in prepandemic individuals, indicating potential
crossreactivity with common cold human coronaviruses (HCoV) and questioning its utility in
seroprevalence studies. We investigated the immunogenicity of the full-length and shorter
fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, and the crossreactivity of antibodies with HCoV.
We indentified a C-terminus region in SARS-CoV2 N of minimal sequence homology with
HCoV that was more specific and highly immunogenic. IgGs to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N
also recognised N229E N, and IgGs to HKU1 N recognised SARS-CoV-2 N. Crossreactivity
with SARS-CoV-2 was stronger for alpha- rather than beta-HCoV despite having less
sequence identity, revealing the importance of conformational recognition. Higher preexisting
IgG to OC43 N correlated with lower IgG to SARS-CoV-2 in rRT-PCR negative individuals,
reflecting less exposure and indicating a potential protective association. Antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 N were higher in patients with more severe and longer symptoms and in
females. IgGs remained stable for at least 3 months, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster. In
conclusion, N is a primary target of SARS-CoV-2-specific and HCoV crossreactive
antibodies, both of which may affect the acquisition of immunity to COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The identification of the antigens and epitopes that induce antibody responses after exposure
to SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the requirements to estimate the seroprevalence in a
population. In addition, it is also essential to understand immunity to COVID-19 disease.
Previous knowledge on other related coronaviruses and the prompt sequencing of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome early in the pandemic allowed to identify the spike (S) (1) and the
nucleocapsid (N) (2) structural proteins as major targets of antibodies. Consequently, both
antigens constituted the basis for most immunoassays developed to study COVID-19
distribution and protective immune responses. The surface glycoprotein S, which contains
the receptor binding domain (RBD), has a better known function in immunity (3–5) and is the
leading antigen candidate for vaccine development (6, 7). N is smaller than S, lacks a
glycosylation site, and is extensively used in leading serodiagnostics kits (8–11) due to its
abundant expression during infection (12–14) and early antibody response (15, 16), but its
immunological relevance is less established. The pattern of antibody responses to S
compared to N may vary according to disease severity (17) and age (18). N forms
ribonucleoprotein complexes during the virion assembly process by binding to the viral RNA
genome and packing it into long helical structures (19). Its main function is to regulate viral
RNA transcription during replication, promoting the synthesis of its own proteins (14) while
interfering with the metabolism (19, 20), protein translation (21) and proliferation (22) of the
infected host cell. During the process of infection, N dissociates itself from the genome and is
exposed to the host immune system (23), and its high immunogenicity has also prompted its
exploration as vaccine target (13, 24).
We recently developed a multiplex quantitative suspension array assay using the xMAP
Luminex technology (25). We included antigen fragments of S, N and membrane (M) SARSCoV-2 proteins to establish the utility of each construct for seroprevalence and correlates of
immunity studies. Initial investigations using plasma or serum samples from individuals
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and prepandemic samples (negative controls), showed different

levels of immunogenicity and specificity across the antigens and fragments tested. Even
though antibodies to full-length N (N FL) constructs were usually high in adult COVID-19
cases, moderate to high responses were frequently detected in samples collected before the
pandemic (25), as it had been reported before also for SARS-CoV-1 samples (26). This
questioned the use of N FL for seropositivity calculations that were consequently restricted to
S-based antigens in our initial evaluations (27). We hypothesized that such antibody signals
in negative controls, more prominent for N than S antigens, reflected crossreactivity with
human coronaviruses of the common cold (HCoV) due to highly conserved regions, rather
than nonspecific or polyreactive responses. The HCoV include alphacoronaviruses (229E
and NL63) and betacoronaviruses (HKU1 and OC43). In fact, increasing number of reports in
the literature are consistent with some antibodies to HCoV being crossreactive with the
betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 (28–32). Interestingly, significant protein
similarity between SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoV has been reported for N,
including a highly conserved motif in the N-terminal (NT) half of the protein (FYYLGTGP)
(33) and relevant immunodominant epitope regions (24, 34). Likewise, preexisting SARSCoV-2-specific T cells have also been reported and attributed to crossreactivity with HCoV
previously encountered (35–39).
A key question is the relevance of those preexisting antibodies on acquisition of COVID-19
immunity. Is this crossreactivity sufficient to protect against disease? (40). If this is the case,
it could be one of the reasons why children may be more protected than older adults (41)
(42, 43). Alternatively, these preexisting crossreactive antibodies could interfere with the
development and/or maintenance of effective levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (44, 45) and,
even worse, they could have a negative impact by mediating antibody-dependent disease
enhancement (ADE) (46, 47), which could be associated with severe prognosis (48, 49).
Our study aimed to better characterize the immunogenicity, specificity and crossreactivity of
anti-N antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 and 229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43 HCoV, measured
simultaneosuly. To this end, we tested different antigenic fragments in multiplex and different
Ig isotypes, and compared their relative immunogenicity in prepandemic and pandemic

samples, including SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. In addition, we aimed to better understand
the demographic, clinical and epidemiological variables affecting the levels of antibodies to N
SARS-CoV-2 in exposed people. Our study helps addressing the extent and characteristics
of this crossreactivity in the immune response to COVID-19 and the utility of various N-based
antigens in serodiagnostics and seroprevalence studies.

RESULTS
Immunogenicity, specificity and seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 N antibodies
Plasmas from individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 had statistically significantly higher
levels of IgG, IgA and IgM to the FL as well as the NT and C-terminal (CT) domains of
SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Figure S1) than prepandemic plasmas (Figure 1). Levels were
statistically significantly higher in patients who were hospitalized compared to nonhospitalized (asymptomatics and mild cases) (Figure 1A). However, prepandemic plasmas
also contained IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies recognizing N antigens. In the case of IgG, the
responses against N FL were the highest, followed by the N NT and N CT domains. This
high reactivity of negative control plasmas resulted in a higher seropositivity cutoff and lower
seroprevalence estimates for IgG to N FL in our cohort of health care workers, with 10.1% at
M1 (Figure S2A) compared with 11.3% for RBD (27). Higher plasma dilutions (1/3500 vs.
1/500) reduced antibody levels proportionally more in prepandemic than pandemic samples,
increasing signal-to-noise ratio, sensitivity and overall seropositivity (Figure S2B).
Nevertheless, seroreactivity in prepandemic samples was still patent, which could be
attributed to the presence in our antigens of stretches of immunogenic aminoacid sequences
similar to other HCoV (24, 28). Searching for SARS-CoV-2 specific responses, we tested a
CT-short protein and a CT-peptide from N that had a lower percentage of identity with
HCoVs N (Figure S1). The shorter N CT constructs were immunogenic in pandemic positive
samples and less seroreactive in prepandemic samples than N FL, with higher signal-to-

noise ratios obtained (Figure 1B). Additional information on the serological characterization
of the rest of N FL constructs is provided in the Supplemental material, Figures S3 & S4.

Crossreactivity of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV N FL proteins
To test whether the antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 N antigens in negative samples
could be due to crossreactivity with HKU1, OC43, NL63 or 229E HCoV, we compared the
patterns of IgG responses to N FL from the five coronaviruses in prepandemic and COVID19 samples at two timepoints, also including the SARS-CoV-2 N CT-short fragment. Overall,
anti-N IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 were significantly higher in COVID-19 cases vs.
prepandemic samples compared to HCoV IgG levels, which were similar or slightly higher in
pandemic positive vs. prepandemic samples, like for NL63 (Figure 2A). This pattern
indicates both high immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 N antigens in COVID-19 samples, but
also some level of crossreactivity against some HCoV N antigens. Furthermore, data support
the higher SARS-CoV-2-specificity of the IgG response to the CT-short portion of N because
IgG levels in prepandemic samples were the lowest and similar to pandemic real time
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) negative (Figure 2A). Pandemic
samples from rRT-PCR negative health care workers had significantly higher levels of IgG to
N FL, but not N CT-short, than prepandemic samples and significantly lower levels than rRTPCR positive individuals.
In prepandemic samples, IgG levels to HKU1 HCoV N FL were statistically significantly
higher in samples with higher IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 N FL (Figure 2B), and there was a
significant correlation (rho=0.35, p=0.0065) between N FL IgG responses of HKU1 HCoV to
SARS-CoV-2 and to a lesser extent with NL63 HCoV (Figure 3A), suggestive of
crossreactivity. In pandemic rRT-PCR positive samples, IgG levels to 229E HCoV N FL were
statistically significantly higher in samples with higher IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 N FL
(Figures 2C), and there was a significant correlation of N FL IgG responses between SARSCoV-2 and 229E HCoV (rho=0.38-0.45, p<0.0024) (Figures 3A & 3B). Correlation between
N FL and N CT-short was higher and more significant in pandemic (rho=0.79, p<0.001) and

rRT-PCR positive (rho=0.6, p<0.001), compared to prepandemic and rRT-PCR negative
samples, respectively (Figure 3A & 3B). In contrast, there was a significant inverse
correlation between OC43 HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in rRT-PCR negative
pandemic samples (rho=-0.39, p=0.019) (Figure 3B). Integrating the magnitude of
responses to the HCoV N FL proteins, the correlation with SARS-CoV-2 N FL was
statistically significant in pandemic (rho=0.29, p=0.026, Figure 3B) and rRT-PCR positive
samples (rho=0.27, p=0.0084, Figure 3C), and it was higher and only significant for alpha(229E and NL63) than for beta-HCoV (229E and NL63) (Figure 3C). The correlation in
prepandemic samples improved when OC43 beta-HCoV was excluded from the HCoV
summation (rho=0.25, p=0.053 vs. rho=0.2 p=0.13), although IgG levels to OC43 strongly
correlated with those of alpha-coronaviruses (rho=0.522 for 229E, rho=0.503 for NL63)
(Figure S5A). SARS-CoV-2 N FL levels correlated more significantly with N NT in
prepandemic (rho=0.526) and with N CT in pandemic (rho>0.624) samples. The breadth of
responses to human coronaviruses was heterogeneous among individuals, but patterns of
antibodies to alpha- and beta-HCoV tended to cluster together (Figure S5B).
In individuals who became infected with SARS-CoV-2 from M0 to M1, IgG levels increased
significantly for SARS-CoV-2 N FL (p=0.015) and SARS-CoV-2 N CT-short (p=0.031), while
antibody profiles for HCoV N proteins were variable (Figure 4). IgG to N from beta-HCoV
tended to decrease or maintain, whereas IgG to N from alpha-HCoV (NL63 and 299E)
increased in about half of individuals but overall not significantly due to low sample size and
high variability. There did not seem to be a relationship between IgG levels at baseline and
the change in levels at month (M)1. In uninfected individuals, IgG levels declined from M0 to
M1, significantly for 4 of 6 N antigens (Figure 4).

Kinetics and determinants of antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 N FL
Having shown that SARS-CoV-2 infections induce a specific antibody response to the N
antigen, despite having in some cases preexisting crossreactive antibodies due to prior
exposure to HCoV, we investigated the kinetics and demographic, clinical and

epidemiological variables associated with the levels of immunoglobulins to N FL. We
analyzed samples from the cohort of health care workers followed up for 3 months in whom
we had previously characterized RBD antibodies (27, 50). We performed two analyses,
including (i) all individuals and (ii) only those who were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 RBD
antibodies and, therefore, with evidence of exposure to the virus. IgA and IgM to SARS-CoV2 N FL declined more markedly than IgG, which maintained high levels over the 3 months of
study (Figure 5).
Having symptoms had a statistically significant association with higher IgA and IgG levels to
SARS-CoV-2 N FL, and having a longer duration of symptoms had a statistically significant
association with higher IgA and IgM levels to SARS-CoV-2 N FL (Figure 6A). IgA levels to
SARS-CoV-2 N FL tended to be higher in older individuals, and IgM responses were
statistically significantly higher in females than males (Figure 6B). No other clear
associations were found for occupation or number of COVID-19 contacts.

DISCUSSION
Our study shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces specific IgM, IgA and IgG antibody
responses to epitopes located at both the NT and CT domains of the N protein, consistent
with immunogenicity data reported in the literature (15, 20, 51–53). All antibodies were of
higher magnitude in patients with more severe clinical manifestations compared to those not
requiring hospitalization, and in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic health care workers
for IgG and IgA. Longer duration of symptoms was associated with higher IgA and IgM
levels, IgA levels tended to increase with age, and females had higher IgM levels.
Importantly, anti-N IgG antibodies remained quite stable over a period of at least 3 months
following mild or asymptomatic infection, while IgAs and IgMs declined faster, similar to
SARS-CoV-2 RBD responses (50).
We also found that significant levels of IgG, IgM and IgA recognising SARS-CoV-2 N
proteins are present in so-called negative controls. This reactivity could limit the utility of the
N antigen in seroprevalence studies, as the cutoff values for IgG are higher and hence the

percentage of seropositive individuals may be underestimated, compared to calculations
based on S antigens (27). However, point prevalence estimates during outbreaks could still
be assessed with IgA and IgM to N proteins, as prepandemic samples have lower levels of
such preexisting isotypes probably due to their shorter half-life, which is consistent with our
kinetics data. The seroreactivity of N in negative controls also leads to lower specificity of
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests based on this antigen. To circumvent this, assays with
truncated versions of N based on immunogenic regions have been developed (Roche,
Abbot) (8, 10), as we have done here with N CT-short and N CT-peptide.
Among the three regions of N (NT RNA-binding domain, central linker, and CT dimerization
domain), the NT and CT are the major structural and functional domains (19). Previous
works carried out with SARS-CoV-1 N, sharing >90% identity to SARS-CoV-2 N, revealed
the presence of four main immunodominant regions (EP1-4) in different domains of the N
protein (Figure S1A) (24, 28, 54). We focused on the B cell immunodominant domain EP4
showing a lower percentage of aminoacid identity with other HCoVs (residues 356-404)
(Figure S1B) (55), which corresponds to the CT region of SARS-CoV-2 N. The N CT-short
protein and the N CT-peptide presented epitopes that were more specific and still
immunogenic, thus applicable for seroprevalence and immunity studies. Correlation between
N FL and N CT-short was higher and more significant in pandemic and rRT-PCR positive
compared to prepandemic and rRT-PCR negative samples, respectively, indicative of a
specific response to SARS-CoV-2 N upon infection.
Interestingly, pandemic rRT-PCR negative individuals had higher responses to N FL than
prepandemic samples and significantly lower than rRT-PCR positive individuals. A possible
explanation is that some of the rRT-PCR negative individuals might in fact have been
exposed to SARS-CoV-2 despite being seronegative for RBD antibodies, but they could have
been positive for T cell responses. This could indicate a higher sensitivity of N to detect lowresponders or early infections (28) and would imply that a much higher percentage of the
population than estimated in the literature could have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Alternatively, the responses in rRT-PCR negatives could be due to crossreactivity with HCoV

in this group of health care workers that due to their occupation might be at higher risk of
recent exposure to common colds at a period when they were still prevalent (FebruaryMarch). In contrast, the prepandemic samples had been collected at various times over the
years but a large proportion in June 2008, some months after the cold season peak and the
responses to HCoV are known to be shortlived (56). In line with this, levels of IgG to HCoV N
FL decreased from M0 to M1 in seronegative and rRT-PCR negative individuals. It could also
be a mixture of the two scenarios due to the wide range of antibody levels and overlap
between groups. Therefore, the season of sample collection is an important variable to take
into account. Consistent with crossreactive immune recognition with endemic and other
emerging HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells have also been detected in ~40-60%
of unexposed individuals (35, 37). N is also a representative antigen for T cell response in
vaccine studies, inducing SARS-CoV-specific T cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity (57,
58). However, other studies have reported a lack of N crossreactivity for antibody responses,
with specificities >94%, which may be due to the protein regions included in the tests and/or
the characteristics of the prepandemic controls included (59)(60). In the case of SARS-CoV1, it has been reported that IgGs crossreact with the N antigen of endemic coronavirus, but
only rarely in the other way round (42). To assess if antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV N
proteins were crossreactive and in which direction (28, 42, 61), we tested the longer-lasting
IgGs responses to N FL from 229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43. These HCoV are widely
distributed, with 229E and OC43 causing 15–29% of all common colds (62). 229E, OC43
and NL63 tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperateclimate countries, while NL63 (accounting for an estimated 4.7% of common respiratory
diseases) have a Spring-Summer peak. Data on SARS-CoV-1 reported false-positive results
obtained from a recombinant SARS-CoV-1 N ELISA due to the crossreactivity with
antibodies to HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E (26, 33). Our data suggest that IgGs to SARSCoV-2 N also recognise N229E N, and that IgGs to HKU1 N recognise SARS-CoV-2 N, but
not strongly. IgG levels to NL63 N were higher in pandemic positive vs. prepandemic
samples but similar for other HCoVs. Correlations of SARS-CoV-2 N CT-short with HCoV N

FL were similar to those seen for N FL. When combining all HCoV N FL IgG levels, the
positive correlation with SARS-CoV-2 N FL responses improved by excluding OC43. IgG
responses to OC43 N correlated the least to SARS-CoV-2 in the rest of analyses, although it
had a highly significant correlation with the alpha-HCoV 229E and NL63, in contrast to other
reports (62). Interestingly, in rRT-PCR negative pandemic samples, there was a significant
inverse correlation with IgG to OC43 HCoV that is the beta-HCoV with the highest sequence
homology with SARS-CoV-2 N protein, suggesting a potential role on immunity. If preexisting
IgG to OC43 bind to SARS-CoV-2, high antibody levels could neutralize SARS-CoV-2
infection upon exposure, resulting in sterile protection or low viral loads below the rRT-PCR
detection threshold (rRT-PCR negative) that translates into low/no exposure and
consequently less antibodies to SARS -CoV-2. If rRT-PCR individuals had not been exposed
at all to SARS-CoV-2 (RBD seronegatives), then what would be measured as SARS-CoV-2
IgG might be IgG from crossreactive HCoVs. Nevertheless, a limitation of this study is that
the design and sample size did not allow unraveling the potential effect of baseline HCoV
antibodies on the acquisition of COVID-19 immunity (63), which will be addressed in future
longitudinal follow up analysis of our cohorts. This effect could be neutral, positive (boost of
responses) or negative, whereby having antibodies to certain viruses could adversely
determine the profile of responses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (‘original antigenic sin’) (44,
45, 48) or interfere by antigen masking. Findings from a recent study argue against a
protective role for crossreactive HCoV T cells in SARS-CoV-2 infection (37). In our study, we
speculate that preexisting OC43 HCoV IgGs could be protective and, as a result, incoming
SARS-CoV-2 infections would be more controlled and thus fewer antibodies induced against
them.
Unexpectedly, higher serological correlations were consistently obtained for SARS-CoV-2
and alpha- rather than beta-HCoVs despite having less homology at the primary aminoacid
sequence level. The reactivity of the alpha- and beta-HCoVs clustered together within
families, also by PCA analysis (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that crossreactivity is
also and mostly driven by homologies at the conformational rather than the linear level.

Overall, data indicated various degrees of moderate crossreactivity for SARS-CoV-2 and
HCoV N antigens, but patterns were heterogeneous and not very strong, possibly as a result
of a complex polyclonal response in which different epitopes in the various viral antigens
would have a wide spectrum of serological recognition and mixed binding avidities.
Our study had some limitations. We did not have access to samples from HCoV infected
(rRT-PCR positive) individuals and thus the crossreactivity among the N antigens could not
be fully assessed (64). In addition, we did not test IgG responses to other domains of N (like
the NT that has significant sequence homologies except for a small aminoacid region) or
other structural proteins (54). Our preliminary results show that crossreactivity may also exist
for M and S2 (60), due to antibody recognition in some prepandemic samples, as it had been
similarly described for SARS-CoV infections (65, 66). In fact, different antigens could have
different levels of crossreactivity, as seen in a recent study of HCoV S antibody responses
that reported an increase in IgG to OC43 (but not 229 or NL63) S proteins with SARS-CoV-2
infection (67). This observation contrasts with our data that suggested boost of N IgG from
M0 to M1 for 229 and NL63 but not for OC43. Other respiratory pathogens that are common
coinfections may also have crossreactivity with SARS-CoV-2 and partially explain our results
(68).
In conclusion, the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is immunogenic but it is also recognised by
partially crossreactive HCoV antibodies. More specific epitopes are located in the N CT-short
region and could be used for seroprevalence and diagnostics purposes. Future larger
prospective studies should determine whether the N antigen is a target of protective immune
responses to COVID-19 and therefore a promising vaccine candidate together with S, and
the role of preexisting HCoV antibodies in acquired immunity.

SARS-CoV-2. Heterologously expressed N FL protein was either purchased from a
commercial source (GenScript, Z03480), or purified in house after HEK cell (69) or
Escherichia coli expression (25). Furthermore, two E. coli expressed His-tagged N protein
constructs comprising the NT domain (residues 43-180) and CT domain (residues 250-360)
were purified by affinity chromatography, as described (25). A shorter fragment of the CT
region (CT-short), with a lower percentage of identity with other HCoVs and located within a
putative N protein immunodominant region (EP4, residues 348-416) (24, 28), was also
heterologously expressed in E. coli cells and His tag-purified, as described (25). Finally, an
even shorter peptide, based on a less conserved region of the CT end
(QRQKKQQTVTLLPAADLDDFSKQ, residues 384-406) was synthesized (CT-peptide)
(Figure S1) (54). Additional information on the N constructs is provided in the Supplemental
material.
HCoV. N FL recombinant proteins from OC43, HKU1, NL63 and 229E HCoVs were codonoptimized for E. coli heterologous expression and His tag-purified as in (25).

Study volunteers and samples
We analyzed three set of samples, (i) prepandemic plasmas from healthy adults collected
before the COVID-19 outbreak (negative controls, n=128), (ii) pandemic plasmas from health
care personnel working at Hospital Clínic in Barcelona (Spain) collected as part of a study on
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence at the March-April 2020 outbreak (n=578) of which SARS-CoV2 infected cases were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (27, 50), and (iii) pandemic
plasmas from 49 COVID-19 patients recruited at the Clínica Universidad de Navarra in
Pamplona (Spain), of which 47 had severe symptoms and were hospitalized and 2 had mild
symptoms (25).
For the characterization of the immunogenicity of the various SARS-CoV-2 N protein
constructs, we used all prepandemic and 104 pandemic samples. For the analysis of HCoV
N FL cross-reactivity, we selected 30 prepandemic samples with the highest levels of IgG to
SARS-CoV-2 N FL and 30 prepandemic samples with the lowest levels, among our set of

negative controls tested previously (Figure S6) (25). Pandemic samples included: (i) 60
plasmas from individuals with a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by rRT-PCR and
seropositive for RBD tested in our prior studies (27, 50) (29 plasmas with the highest and 31
plasmas with the lowest levels of IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N FL), (ii) 30 plasmas from individuals
with a negative rRT-PCR and RBD serology but with high IgG to N FL, and (iii) 7 negative
individuals at recruitment M0 who later got infected and seroconverted for RBD at M1.
For the analysis of factors associated with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 N FL and their
kinetics, we tested all the plasma samples available from the cohort of health care workers in
Barcelona at baseline (M0=578) and 1 and 3 months later (M1=565, M3=70) (27, 50).

Study approval
The research was carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and
informed consent was obtained. Samples analyzed in this study received ethical clearance
for immunological evaluation and/or inclusion as controls in immunoassays, and the
protocols and informed consent forms were approved by the Institutional Review Board at
Hospital Clínic in Barcelona (Refs. CEIC-7455 and HCB/2020/0336) or Universidad de
Navarra (Ref. UN/2020/067) prior to study implementation.

Measurement of IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies.
qSAT assays to measure plasma IgG, IgA and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 N proteins were
performed as reported (27) and analyzed in a Luminex 100/200 instrument. For the
assessement of IgG crossreactivity between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, we applied
an optimized protocol, as described (25), and samples were analyzed with a FlexMap 3D
instead of a Luminex 100/200 instrument, to increase the dynamic quantification range of
antibody values in high responders (Figure S7). Briefly, N proteins coupled to magnetic
microspheres (Luminex Corporation, Austin, USA) were incubated with plasma samples
(1/500 and/or 1/3500 dilutions) or blank controls in 96-well plates. For the CT-peptide, avidinbeads were used that bound the biotin conjugated to a PEG12 biopolymer linked to the

peptide, and the coupling performed following manufacturer’s instructions. Before
multiplexing protein-coupled MagPlex beads, we tested for potential interference among N
constructs comparing to singleplex assays (Figure S7). After sample incubation with beads,
plates were washed and a labeled secondary antibody (anti-human IgG, IgM, or IgA) was
added. Following the last incubation, plates were washed and read in a Luminex xMAP®
analyzer. Crude median fluorescent intensities (MFI) and background fluorescence from
blank wells were exported using the xPONENT software.

Statistics
Boxplots and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to compare antibody levels to each N
protein between study groups. To assess for crossreactivity, we performed correlations
(Spearman) and heatmaps of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV N antigens in
prepandemic and pandemic samples separately, stratifying by rRT-PCR positivity and by
high vs. low anti-N FL IgG responders, as appropriate. Seropositivity was defined by a cutoff
calculated with prepandemic samples as 10 to the mean plus 3 standard deviations of log10transformed MFI. A variable called magnitude of responses to HCoV N FL was created by
adding up the levels of IgG to the four HCoV N FL. To evaluate the factors associated with
levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 N FL, we used Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The LOESS
(locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) method was used to fit a curve to depict kinetics of
antibody levels over time. The analysis was carried out using the statistical software R studio
version R-4.0.2 (70) (packages used: tidyverse (71), pheatmap (72) and corrplot (73)).
