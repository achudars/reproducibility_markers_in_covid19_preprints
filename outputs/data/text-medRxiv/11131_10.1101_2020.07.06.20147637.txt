Introduction.

14

The course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe (acute respiratory distress,
cytokine storms, and death) in patients. The basis for this range in symptoms is unknown.
One possibility is that genetic variation is responsible for the highly variable response to
infection. We evaluated how well a genetic risk score based on chromosome-scale length
variation and machine learning classification algorithms could predict severity of response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

15

Methods.

22

We compared 981 patients from the UK Biobank dataset who had a severe reaction to SARSCOV-2 infection before 27 April 2020 to a similar number of age matched patients drawn for
the general UK Biobank population. For each patient, we built a profile of 88 numbers
characterizing the chromosome-scale length variability of their germ line DNA. Each number
represented one quarter of the 22 autosomes. We used the machine learning algorithm
XGBoost to build a classifier that could predict whether a person would have a severe
reaction to Covid-19 based only on their 88-number classification.

23

Results.

24

27

We found that the XGBoost classifier could differentiate between the two classes at a
significant level  2 · 10ିଵଵ as measured against a randomized control and  3 · 10ିଵସ
measured against the expected value of a random guessing algorithm (AUC=0.5). However,
we found that the AUC of the classifier was only 0.51, too low for a clinically useful test.

Introduction:

31

The course of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to severe (acute respiratory distress,

32

cytokine storms, and death) in patients. The basis for this range in symptoms is unknown. One

33

possibility is that genetic variation is responsible for the highly variable response to infection.

34

Human genetic variation can affect susceptibility and resistance to viral infections[1]. For

35

instance, variants in the gene IFITM3 affect the severity of seasonal influenza[2]. Patients

36

hospitalized from seasonal influenza had a particular allele of the gene IFITM3 at a higher rate

37

than expected from the general population. Laboratory work determined that this particular allele

38

can alter the course of the influenza virus infection.

39

We have previously shown that chromosome-scale length variation is a powerful tool to

40

analyze genome wide associations[3]. This method is particularly appealing for genetic risk

41

scores because it includes epistatic effects that might be missed with conventional genome wide

42

association studies.

43

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how well a genetic risk score based on

44

chromosome-scale length variation and machine learning classification algorithms can predict

45

severity of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We evaluated this approach on a dataset of 931

46

patients who had a severe reaction to Covid-19 in 2010. These patients had been previously

47

genotyped as part of the UK Biobank.

48

Methods:

49

Data was obtained from the UK Biobank under Application Number 47850. First, we

50

downloaded the “l2r” files from the UK Biobank. Each chromosome has a separate “l2r” file.

51

Each “l2r” file contained 488,377 columns and a variable number of rows. Each column

52

represented a unique patient in the dataset, who can be identified with an encoded ID number.

53

Each row represented a different SNP. The values in the file represent the log base 2 ratio of

54

intensity relative to the expected two copies measured at the SNP location.

55

After downloading the “l2r” data from the UK Biobank, we computed the mean l2r value

56

for a portion of the chromosome for each patient in the dataset. This process produced a dataset

57

where each person was represented by a series of 88 numbers. Each number represents the length

58

variation for 25% of the 22 non-sex chromosomes. A value of 0 represents the nominal average

59

length of that portion of the particular chromosome. We call this dataset the chromosome-scale

60

length variation (CSLV) dataset.

61

This CSLV dataset was matched with the UK Biobank Covid-19 dataset. The Covid-19

62

data were provided to UK Biobank by Public Health England. UK Biobank matched the person

63

in the Public Health England data with UK Biobanks internal records to produce the person’s

64

encoded participant ID. The dataset we have, provided by UK Biobank contains the participant

65

ID, date the specimen was taken, laboratory that processed the sample, whether the patient was

66

an inpatient when the sample was taken, and the result (positive/negative) of the test. The UK

67

Biobank continues to update the data approximately biweekly.

68

The criteria for testing and interpretation of results in the UK Biobank Covid-19 data has

69

evolved. A positive test in this dataset earlier than 27 April 2020 was a good indication that the

70

person had severe disease.

71

performed on symptomatic people and this dataset only includes people tested in a hospital.

72

After 27 April 2020, NHS instructed hospitals to test all non-elective patients admitted, including

73

asymptomatic patients. The UK Biobank dataset released after 27 May 2020 includes “pillar 2”

74

positive test results.

Table 1. We segmented the dataset into three overlapping subsets.
The first, which we called “1930” contained all UK Biobank
participants born after 1930 who had a severe reaction to SARSCoV-2 infection before 27 April 2020. The two subsets contained
people born after 1940 and after 1950.

82

Using the CSLV-Covid-19 dataset, we selected all people who tested positive before 27

83

April 2020 and labelled these as people having a severe reaction to Covid-19. We segmented

84

these into three overlapping datasets, as shown in Table 1. We constructed an age-matched

85

control group of the same size that had an identical age profile as those in the severe reaction

86

group.

87

excepting those few who had a severe reaction to Covid-19. Since only a small fraction of the

88

people in the UK Biobank had a severe reaction to Covid-19, we could rerun the analysis with a

89

different age-matched control group many times to build up statistics. We chose this control

90

group based on the data available and the finding that severe reactions to Covid-19 are a strong

91

function of age and uncommon (only about 20% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 require

92

ICU admission even among those in their 70s)[4,5].

The age-matched control group was selected from the entire UK Biobank dataset,

93

We used the H2O machine learning package in R to create XGBoost[6] models that were

94

trained to classify a person in the dataset, consisting of those who had a severe reaction and age-

95

matched controls, based solely on their chromosome scale length variation data.

97

The results are presented in Figure 1 and Table 2. As Figure 1 shows, we found a

98

significant difference between all three age groupings and their corresponding random controls.

99

This finding indicates that germ line genetics of the infected patient, as represented by the set of

100

chromosome-scale length variation numbers, has an effect on the severity of COVID-19.

101

Figure 1 and Table 3 also show that the AUC (area under the curve of the receiver

102

operating characteristic curve) for the XGBoost classification model was about 0.51. A

103

classification model with an AUC of 0.51 is just slightly better than guessing.

Figure 1. This boxplot figure presents the results of the machine
learning predictions. We created three different datasets, one
which includes all patients less than 90 years old, the second
includes every patient less than 80 years old, and the third with
every patient less than 70 years old. These are indicated as the
oldest birthyear “data”. Each dataset included an equal number of
patients with a “severe reaction” to Covid-19 and an equal number
of age matched people drawn from the general UK Biobank
population, “normal”. For comparison, we took those three
datasets and randomly permuted the status (“severe reaction” or
“normal”) and repeated the process. This randomly permuted
dataset is labelled oldest birthyear “random”. For each dataset, we
repeated the whole process 100 times, each time with a different
set of age matched people from the general UK Biobank
population.

Table 2. We compared the difference in mean AUC values
between the various datasets using a t-test. The datasets consisting
of people born after 1930, 1940, and 1950 all showed significant
differences with the corresponding random control. Those three
datasets also showed significant differences between the mean
AUC and 0.5. The three random controls did not show a
significant difference between the mean AUC and 0.5, as expected.
An AUC value of 0.5 represents a random classification test, one
in which the algorithm is no better than guessing.

First, a genetic difference exists

141

between those who have the most severe course of the disease and the general population.

142

Second, we were not able to exploit this difference to develop a clinically useful test to

143

distinguish between people who will experience a severe course of the disease and those who

144

will not. We could only demonstrate a genetic risk test with an AUC of 0.51, only slightly above

145

0.50 which represents random guessing.

146

Although the AUC we found here is too low to be clinically useful, several avenues for

147

improving the AUC exist. We were constrained by the data available to compare those who had

148

a severe reaction to Covid-19 with the general population, but the general population probably

149

contains a substantial number of people who would also have a severe reaction to Covid-19. A

150

better approach would be to compare those who had a severe reaction to Covid-19 with those

151

who were asymptomatic or had a mild reaction. Simply having more data on those patients who

152

had a severe reaction might also lead to an increase in AUC. We could also have more data on

153

each individual patient. The algorithm we used for transforming “l2r” data into our final

154

chromosome-scale length variation data took averages over each quarter of a chromosome. We

155

could instead include smaller chromosome segments. Finally, an alternative machine learning

156

algorithm might provide improved AUC. Different algorithms perform differently on different

157

classes of problems. [7] We did a brief test of different algorithms before choosing XGBoost for

158

this problem, but, for instance, a deep learning algorithm might have superior performance with

159

proper tuning.

160

Our results add to the recent work done by other on the link between genetics and

161

severity of Covid-19. A detailed study of this UK Biobank Covid-19 dataset identified that

162

Black and Asian patients were at a significantly higher risk of testing positive compared to white

163

patients [8]. This study also attempted to derive a polygenic risk score. However, when they

164

applied the polygenic risk score to a hold-out group, they found that the mean score was

165

indistinguishable between the group of people who had tested positive and the group that had no

166

positive test. In comparison, our work found that these two groups are distinguishable with a

167

genetic risk score, but only very slightly. We measured the AUC at 0.51. They do not report an

168

AUC, but an indistinguishable test is the equivalent of an AUC of 0.50.

169

Other more comprehensive metastudies have identified one specific genetic component

170

behind the severity of Covid-19. For instance, one study of Covid-19 patients who experienced

171

respiratory failure at seven hospitals in Italy and Spain found a fairly strong association in a

172

cluster of genes lying on part of chromosome 3 and a borderline association in chromosome 9

173

encompassing the ABO blood group locus [9]. The June 2020 results posted by the Covid-19

174

Host Genetics Initiative [10,11], also indicate a strong association in Chromosome 3, but fail to

175

reproduce the association in chromosome 9. The Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative “ANA_B2”

176

study represents hospitalized Covid-19 patients compared to the general population and are

177

derived from mostly patients in Europe and Brazil. Neither study attempted to derive a genetic

178

risk score.

179

Conclusion:

180

183

In conclusion, we found a significant difference exists between the structural genomics of
those patients in the UK Biobank who had a severe reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the
general UK Biobank population. However, a test based upon this difference would not be
clinically useful in its present state, since it had an AUC of 0.51.
