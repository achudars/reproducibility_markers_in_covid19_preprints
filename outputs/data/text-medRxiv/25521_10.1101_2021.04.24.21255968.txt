ABSTRACT

Objective: To estimate mortality of care home residents during the Covid-19 pandemic from
primary care electronic health records.
Design: Matched cohort study
Setting: 1,421 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink
Aurum Database in England.
Participants: 217,987 patients aged 18 to 104 years with recorded care home residence in
England in the period 2015 to 2020. There were 86,371 care home residents contributing
data in 2020, with 29,662 deaths; 83,419 (97%) were matched on age, gender and general
practice with 312,607 community-dwelling adults.
Main outcome measures: All-cause mortality. Analysis was by Poisson regression
adjusting for age, gender, long-term conditions, region, year and calendar week.
Results: The highest first wave age-specific mortality rate was 6.02 (95% confidence
interval 5.97 to 6.07) per 100 patients per week in men aged 95-104 years between 13th-19th
April 2020. Compared with community-dwelling controls, the adjusted rate ratio for mortality
of care home residents was 4.95 (4.62 to 5.32) in February 2020, increasing to 8.34 (7.95 to
8.74) in April 2020, declining to 3.93 (3.68 to 4.20) in December 2020. During the week of
13th to 19th April 2020, mortality of care home residents was 10.74 (9.72 to 11.85) times
higher than for matched community-dwelling controls.
Conclusions: Individual-patient data from primary care electronic health records may be
used to estimate mortality in care home residents. Mortality is substantially higher than for
community-dwelling comparators and showed a disproportionate increase in the first wave of
the Covid-19 pandemic but not the second wave. This study provides evidence to support
earlier, decisive action to protect these vulnerable populations in the event of further
outbreaks. Prospective investigations of care home mortality are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
The Covid-19 pandemic had major impacts during 2020.1 The first wave of infections peaked
between 7th-9th April 2020 in the UK, with more than 1,000 deaths per day within 28 days of
a positive Covid-19 test. Transmission rates subsided during the summer months then rose
again in the latter part of the year. The number of people in the UK with a positive COVID-19
test result peaked at 81,525 on 29th December 2020, while deaths reached a maximum on
19th January 20211 Early studies identified deprivation,2 household overcrowding,3 older age,
male gender, obesity, comorbidity and ethnic minority status as being important risk factors
for severe disease and mortality.4 Residents of care homes and nursing homes (referred to
subsequently as ‘care homes’) were particularly severely affected by the pandemic. At the
beginning of the pandemic, there was concern that hospitals discharged patients to care
homes with insufficient consideration of the risks of disease transmission, while Covid-19
testing was not widely available.5 NHS England guidance issued in March 2020 stressed the
importance of increasing critical care capacity and the urgent need for discharge of medically
fit patients.6 It was not until April 2020 that the Covid-19 action plan for adult social care was
published, which included measures to test all asymptomatic care home residents.7 There
were also concerns that care homes had insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE)
and limited access to Covid tests for patients and staff.8 Data from the Office for National
Statistics showed that weekly counts of deaths of care home residents in England and
Wales increased from 2,799 in the last week of February to 8,476 and 9,015 in the last two
weeks of April 2020.9 Analysis of data reported to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in
England suggested that excess deaths represented about 6.5% of care home beds.10 Care
home residents typically have multiple risk markers for Covid-19 vulnerability, but the
transmission of Covid-19 may also have been facilitated in the care home environment and
outbreaks were frequent. However, rigorous epidemiological analysis has been limited and
few studies included denominator data, case-mix variables or population controls. An
editorial in the BMJ observed that ‘the covid-19 pandemic has placed a spotlight on how little
is known about this sector, and the lack of easily accessible, aggregated data on the UK

care home population’.11 In order to address this gap, we aimed to explore whether primary
care electronic health records could be used to evaluate care home mortality during the
pandemic. Jain et al.12 suggested that primary care electronic health records could be used
to provide estimates for the living arrangement and care home residence of older adults that
were comparable to those from census data. We aimed to use primary care electronic health
records to estimate all-cause mortality and excess mortality for care home residents in
England during 2020.

METHODS

Data source and participant selection
The study drew on data from the CPRD Aurum database, a large database of longitudinal
primary care electronic health records in England.13 CPRD Aurum includes comprehensive
records for symptoms, signs, medical diagnoses, tests and referrals, with data coded using
Snomed CT.13 The CPRD Aurum database includes a total of 1,473 general practices in
England with approximately 14.8 million registered patients at 1st January 2020.

This study used data from the March 2021 release of CPRD Aurum for all 215,209 patients
registered in CPRD Aurum general practices in England between 1st January 2015 and 31st
January 2021 who were recorded as being resident in a care home. We employed a list of
49 medical codes indicative of care home residence. The most frequently recorded index
care home codes were ‘lives in a nursing home [or] care home’ (Supplementary Table 1).
There were 28,563 (13%) patients with index codes of ‘patient died in a nursing home [or]
care home’. For these, patients we assumed that they were resident in the care home for 90
days before death. The median length of stay is two years for care home residents, and one
year for nursing home residents,14 but we assumed that patients with first codes for ‘died in

nursing/care home’ would have lower than average lengths of stay. In sensitivity analyses,
we found that varying this assumed duration between 14 and 365 days had negligible
influence on estimates. For each patient, the start date was the latest of the patient’s start of
registration, 1st January 2015 or the first care home code. The end of the patient’s record
was the earliest of the end of patient registration, the death date recorded by CPRD and the
last data collection date for the practice. We included patients aged 18 to 104 years of age.

For 86,371 care home residents contributing person-time during 2020, a matched
comparison cohort of community-dwelling adults was sampled from the list of all patients
registered in the CPRD Aurum March 2021 release after excluding care home residents.
Patients were eligible as controls if they contributed person-time after 1st January 2015.
Control patients were matched for general practice, gender and year of birth, and had a start
date that was no later than 18 months after the start date for matched cases. Up to four
community-dwelling control participants were randomly sampled with replacement15 for each
care home resident. Care home residents were omitted from this analysis where there were
no matched controls. As the difference in mortality between care home residents and
community-dwelling controls was found to be greater than anticipated, control selection, data
extraction and data analysis were repeated to confirm the reproducibility of findings.

Main measures
The primary measure of interest was mortality from any cause based on the CPRD death
date. Death records were included up to seven days after the end of record to allow for
possible delayed recording into primary care records. Covariates were age, gender, region in
England and multiple morbidity. Age was updated in each year and was divided into the agegroups of 18 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, 85 to 94 and 95 to 104 years. Multiple morbidity was
represented by a count of conditions ever recorded in each patient’s record, updated each

year, from the list of atrial fibrillation, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, dementia, depression, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, frailty fractures, heart
failure, haemorrhagic stroke, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, other
mental health diagnoses, peripheral arterial disease, palliative care, rheumatoid arthritis or
transient ischaemic attack. Data for frailty index scores recorded into electronic health
records were also evaluated but, as these were more sparsely recorded and did not add
useful information after allowing for a count of morbidities, these were not considered further.

Statistical analysis
We analysed eligible patient records between 1st January 2015 and 31st January 2021. We
initially divided records into calendar months, calculating the number of deaths and person
time at risk for each month. We fitted a Poisson regression model, using data up to the end
of 2019 as the training dataset, with counts of observed deaths as dependent variable and
age-group, gender, region, multiple morbidity, calendar month and calendar year as
predictors. Month was fitted as a factor, while year was fitted as a continuous predictor with
a quadratic term to allow for possible non-linearity. Multiple morbidity was fitted as a factor
with categories from one to nine or more morbidities, with a separate category for ‘none
recorded’. From the fitted Poisson model, we obtained predicted deaths by month for the
period 2015 to 2020. We compared predicted and observed deaths graphically. In order to
evaluate mortality in 2020 in more detail, we divided patient records into calendar weeks,
analysing counts of deaths and patients resident in each week. Predicted deaths were
estimated from a Poisson model fitted to data for 2015 to 2019 and excess deaths were
estimated as the difference between observed and predicted deaths. An equivalent Poisson
regression model was used to estimate the adjusted morality rate ratio for care home
residents compared with controls, for each month of 2020. Analyses were performed using
the ‘statsmodels’16 package in Python 3.8.3. The ‘matplotlib’17 package in Python and the
‘ggplot2’18 package in the R program were used for graphics.

Patient and Public Involvement
Patients and the public were not involved in the design of the study, the conduct of the
analysis nor the interpretation and reporting of the results.

RESULTS
There were 217,987 patients who were registered at general practices in England, were
recorded as resident in a Care Home, and contributed follow-up after 1st January 2015.
(Table 1). There were 138,868 (64%) women; 98,613 (45%) were aged 85 to 94 years and
25,040 (12%) were aged 95 or older; 183,021 (84%) had two or more morbidities. There
were 86,371 care home residents contributing follow-up time during 2020.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of observed deaths by month from 2015 to 2020. There was
a substantial excess of observed deaths in early 2020, with a peak in April 2020. From 2015
to 2019, there were mean 1,668 deaths during April; in April 2020, there were 5,431 deaths.
Predicted expected deaths in 2020 are shown in blue in Figure 1. Supplementary Table 2
shows the Poisson model fitted to data for 2015 to 2019, which was employed to estimate
predicted deaths. Mortality was greater in men and increased with age. There was a graded
association of mortality with number of morbidities, except for the category of patients with
no morbidities recorded.

In order to investigate the pandemic peak in mortality in more detail, analyses were repeated
using calendar weeks for analysis, with data presented as deaths per 100 patients per week
by age-group and gender (Figure 2, upper panel). There was a peak in observed deaths
between 6th April 2020 and 26th April 2020. Mortality rates were higher in men than women
and increased in successive age-groups. The highest age-specific mortality rate was 6.02

(95% confidence interval 5.97 to 6.07) per 100 patients per week in men aged 95-104 years
between 13th-19th April. Excess deaths, calculated as the difference between observed and
predicted deaths, were summed across all age-groups (Figure 2, lower panel). Across all
ages, excess deaths peaked in men between 13th-19th April, at 2.70 per 100 per week.
Analysis by region (Supplementary Figure 1) confirmed that care home residents in all
regions were affected by the pandemic but there were slight variations in the timing and
magnitude of first wave mortality, with London and the North East regions having the highest
peak mortality rates.

There were 83,419 of the 86,371 (97%) care home residents contributing person-time in
2020 that were successfully matched on general practice, gender and year of birth with up to
four community-dwelling control participants. (Supplementary Table 3). Care home residents
were omitted if there were no eligible controls. There were 312,607 controls of which
240,043 were unique. Controls had a generally similar distribution of gender and age-group
(Supplementary Table 3) but there was a slight deficit of controls in the oldest age-group
consistent with a smaller number of eligible controls available. Care home residents
generally had more long-term conditions than controls.

Figure 3 presents weekly mortality rates for care home residents and community dwelling
controls during 2020. Mortality was higher for care home residents throughout the year. The
first wave peak of mortality was evident in care home patients and controls but was
substantially greater in the former. In the final weeks of 2020, mortality increased in
community-dwelling controls, but this was less apparent in care home residents. Table 2
presents deaths and counts of persons at risk by month during 2020, together with rate
ratios adjusted for age-group, gender, region and long-term conditions. In February 2020,
mortality was 4.95 (4.62 to 5.32) times higher in care home residents than controls; by April

2020, mortality was 8.34 (7.95 to 8.74) times higher. During the week of 13th to 19th April
2020, analysis of data from Figure 3 showed adjusted mortality of care home residents was
10.74 (9.72 to 11.85) times higher than for community-dwelling controls. The rate ratio
declined from May 2020 onwards, reaching 3.93 (3.68 to 4.20) in December 2020.

DISCUSSION

Main findings
The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is acknowledged to have had a particularly severe
impact on patients living in care homes and nursing homes. However, there is a lack of
patient-level data concerning the health outcomes of social care during the pandemic.11 This
analysis shows that primary care electronic health records have potential to provide timely
and relevant information concerning the care home population. Analyses quantified the first
wave of Covid-19 mortality in April 2020 and showed that mortality peaked between 6th and
26th April, being strongly associated with advanced age and male gender. In men aged 95
and older, our analyses estimated that there were approximately 6 deaths per 100 patients
per week at the height of the first wave. Regional variations in the impact of Covid-19 were
also evident. Compared with community-dwelling control patients, mortality for care home
residents was four to five times higher before the onset of the pandemic. Care home
residents were disproportionately affected and during the month of April 2020, after allowing
for differences in case-mix, mortality of care home residents was more than eight times
higher than for community-dwelling patients and more than 10 times higher at the peak of
the first wave.

Strengths and Limitations
An important strength of this study was the use of longitudinal health records to estimate
predicted mortality during 2020 based on data for the preceding five years, taking into
account differences in age and gender distribution, morbidities, region, calendar month and
secular trends over years. This enabled us to quantify excess deaths during the pandemic
months. We were also able to draw on a matched population-based comparison cohort to
quantify changes in the relative risk of mortality in care homes during the pandemic after
adjusting for covariates. We drew on a well-described database,13 and the quality of data
offered by electronic health records has been shown to be generally high.19 However, we
acknowledge that there could be misclassification of care home status and it is possible that
care home residence might be under-recorded. Misclassification might generally have the
effect of reducing associations. We included a count of important long-term conditions, but
we did not find records of frailty index scores to be informative. In the cumulative deficit
model, frailty and multiple morbidity are closely related concepts20 but more accurate
phenotypic characterisation of patients frailty status over time would have added to the
study.21 Deprivation is associated with reduced healthy life expectancy, which could lead to
care home admission. Patients were matched for general practice, so it was not possible to
adjust for deprivation at the general practice-level. We did not employ individual postcodelevel deprivation scores as these might have presented difficulties if the care home postcode
did not reflect deprivation exposures over the life-course. We employed a Poisson model
adjusting for covariates, which provided plausible estimates. A hierarchical model allowing
for general practice clustering and overdispersion did not lead to convergence. It is possible
that estimated confidence intervals might be slightly too narrow, but effects of interest were
unequivocal. Control sampling was with replacement and duplicated controls were included
to reduce bias.15

Comparison with other studies
Previous studies of care home mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic have mainly drawn
on data from care home records.10 22 Morciano et al.10 analysed data for numbers of deaths
reported to the care quality commission and estimated that over the first seven months of
2020, deaths accounted for 6.5% of care home beds. The estimates from our analyses are
not directly comparable because we estimated the mortality rate per 100 residents per week.
Dutey-Magni et al.22 analysed data collected by care homes for incidence of Covid-19 and
mortality. Their findings, like our study, suggested that deaths were frequent among
residents who were probably infected with SARS-CoV-2 but were not tested. Burton et al.23
found that outbreaks of Covid-19 between March and August 2020 in one Scottish region
were frequent within care homes and most deaths occurred in the context of outbreaks.10 23
We did not have data to identify individuals at the same care homes and the possible
clustering of deaths at care homes could not be investigated in our data. Hollinghurst et al.24
analysed linked primary care and administrative records for the population of Wales and
found that care homes showed increased mortality during the first wave of the pandemic.
Their estimates were generally lower than we present here. However, their analysis using
the Cox model could be associated with non-proportional hazards because analysis time
encompassed a period when risks were changing daily. We estimated adjusted relative risks
for each week of the pandemic and showed that there was a substantial increase in the
relative risk of mortality associated with care home residence during the first wave. Other
studies confirm that background mortality is very high in care home residents. Vossius et
al.25 found that annual mortality of nursing home residents was 31.8%. Shah et al.26
analysing the THIN primary care database for 2009 found that the age and sex standardised
mortality ratio for nursing home residents was 419 and for residential home residents was
284, consistent with the elevated relative rates observed in the present analyses.

Implications
Despite awareness since the very early stages of the UK pandemic of evidence from other
contexts that Covid-19 severity was likely to be greatest among the elderly,27 there were
delays in policy guidance which correspond with the timing of Covid-19 mortality peaks in
care home observed in April 2020. In the event of future transmission increases, earlier
implementation of testing and isolation strategies and greater consideration of the effects of
hospital discharge to care homes may be crucial. This study has also highlighted that there
is heterogeneity in the care home population, indicating that the most elderly males may
require particular protection or shielding during periods of high transmission. Regional
variations in mortality might also indicate that more localised approaches should be
explored. Further assessment is required of longer-term issues that have may have
contributed to higher rates of care home Covid-19 mortality such as decreases in local
authority social care spending since 2010, increased privatisation,28 staff shortages 29 30 and
the lack of integration of health and social care services.31 The high mortality of care home
residents during non-pandemic months, even after allowing for the level of morbidity, might
be accounted for by admissions for end-of-life care. Nevertheless, prospective investigations
of mortality in care homes are justified.

Conclusions
Individual-patient data from primary care electronic health records may be used to estimate
mortality in care home residents either in comparison with non-pandemic periods or with
population controls. Analyses confirmed the disproportionate impact of the first-wave of the
Covid-19 pandemic on the care home population, especially in comparison with communityliving comparators. Estimation of deaths per calendar week were mapped against delays in
action to isolate care home residents. In the event of further outbreaks, this study provides
evidence for earlier, decisive action to protect these vulnerable populations.
