Abstract
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019
and has rapidly spread around the globe. The World Health Organization
declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020 just three months after the
introduction of the virus. Individual nations have implemented and enforced
with varying degrees of success a variety of social distancing interventions
to slow the virus spread. Investigating the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 transmission in different settings is an important
research. While most transmission modeling studies have focused on the dynamics in China, neighboring Asian counties, Western Europe, and North
America, there is a scarcity of studies for Eastern Europe. This study starts
to fill this gap by analyzing the characteristics of the first epidemic wave in
Ukraine using mathematical and statistical models together with epidemiological and genomic sequencing data. Using an agent-based model, the
trajectory of the first wave in terms of cases and deaths and explore the im∗

pact of quarantine strategies via simulation studies have been characterized.
The implemented stochastic model for epidemic counts suggests, that even a
small delay of weeks could have increased the number of cases by up to 50%,
with the potential to overwhelm hospital systems. The genomic data analysis suggests that there have been multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into
Ukraine during the early stages of the epidemic with eight distinct transmission clusters identified. The basic reproduction number for the epidemic
has been estimated independently both from case counts data and from genomic data. The findings support the hypothesis that, the public health
measures did not have a decreasing effect on the existing viral population
number at the time of implementation, since strains were detected after the
quarantine date. However, the public health measures did help to prevent
the appearance of new (and potentially more virulent) SARS-CoV-2 variants
in Ukraine.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic started in December 2019 in the Chinese city
of Wuhan located within the province of Hubei [1][2][3][4][5]. Despite the
efforts of Chinese authorities, the virus rapidly spread throughout China,
Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared the spread of the novel coronavirus a pandemic in March, 2020
[6] just three month after the first reported case. The virus would later
be named SARS-CoV-2 and the resulting spectrum of disease COVID-19 [7].
Despite having much lower case-fatality rate than the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the novel
coronavirus has already claimed more lives than both combined [8]. As of
March 1, 2021 there were more than 114 million infections with over 2.5
million deaths [9]. Though multiple treatments have been proposed and
vaccination has now begun in earnest, during the early pandemic period,
social distancing interventions were the only tools at the disposal of public
health authorities to prevent and mitigate transmission [10][11][12]. The
attempts to implement and enforce such measures by governments around
the world were highly variable and included frequent sanitation of public
spaces, enforced social distancing, wearing of masks, and closure of schools,

churches, and other mass gatherings [13] [14][15].
Even well after a year since the epidemic started, fundamental questions
regarding the effects of isolation and lockdown measures [16][17] and the
genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 [18][19][20][21] during the first epidemic
wave remain. Additionally, recent modeling efforts aimed at shedding light
on those questions have mostly focused on China [1][2][3][4], the rest of Asia
[22][23][24], Western and Central Europe [25][23][26], and North America
[27][28][29][30][5], largely neglecting Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern
Europe.
There is a scarcity of modeling studies aimed at elucidating the transmission dynamics and control in Eastern Europe, where the post-socialist
economies and the corresponding healthcare systems are inherently different from Western Europe. The available transmission models for Eastern
Europe are based on relatively simple SIR or similar compartmental models [31][32][33] where individuals are assigned to groups and all individuals
within a given group are expected to have the same characteristics. However, no agent-based modeling studies have been conducted to evaluate the
impact of spatial heterogeneities in key transmission drivers such as population density [32][33] [34][35][36][37][38][39]. Furthermore, research studies on
the COVID-19 pandemic in Eastern Europe have not incorporated genomic
data analysis of circulating viral strains and genomic patterns. In this paper,
we sought to fill the knowledge gap for the Ukrainian epidemic [40], which
provides a unique setting for studying the COVID-19 epidemic in the exUSSR healthcare system, but where quarantine policies similar to the rest of
Europe have been implemented.

2.1. Agent-based Stochastic Model
The Ukrainian territory can also be geographically covered with the local incidence stochastic modeling framework that has been presented earlier
and illustrated in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic in the state of
Massachusetts, USA [41], with some model adjustments and modifications
for Ukraine. The adjustments are necessary since the country territory, the
available incidence and mortality data quality and data reporting mechanisms do vary from country to country.
The local stochastic modeling framework is utilized to investigate the
COVID-19 epidemic in Ukraine and assess the course of the epidemic under

different quarantine scenarios. The framework is represented by an agentbased model in which every newly infected individual is represented as a
programming language object with multiple characteristics of that individual [41]. This analytic framework and the corresponding model have been
adopted for Ukraine, since the available surveillance data and country geography are different. The summary of the framework and the model structure
together with the adaptation details are outlined below:
The progression of the Ukrainian epidemic is modeled in discrete time
slots that correspond to days and are indexed by variable t. For each modeled individual k the corresponding personal characteristics include multiple
parameters such as Cartesian coordinates denoted as (xk ; yk ), the time of
infection onset tinfk in relation to some baseline (which is April 12th, 2020
in the model) and the detection time detk which corresponds to the time between the infection onset and the diagnosis (i.e. the identification of infected
individual k as such). The personal characteristics also include disease stage
vector variable stgk = (stg1(k) ; stg2(k) ; stg3(k) ) that contains the duration of
disease stages such that stg1(k) +stg2(k) +stg3(k) = detk . The current infection
status of the individual is stored in stk (t) variable and is different from day
to day. This state variable can take values: stk (t) = 0 i.e. the individual
k is part of the model input data; stk (t) = 1 i.e. the individual has been
infected but has not been detected as such yet; stk (t) = 2 i.e. the individual
is infected and has been detected; stk (t) = 3 i.e. the individual has recovered
from the virus and is immune, and stk (t) = 4 corresponds to the deceased
status. In addition to that the individual k has a severity variable severk
(i.e. 1 - lethal, 2 - severe, and 3 - mild), a duration variable durk that characterizes the duration of the disease and is generated based on the severk
parameter. The individual reproduction number R0(k) stores the average
number of infected individuals by the individual k across multiple runs. The
summaries of those individual reproduction numbers R0(k) across individuals
are used for the estimation of the population basic reproduction number R0
which serves as a characteristic of the entire epidemic [42]. The correspond2
ing individual-specific transmission parameters are contk = (µcont(k) , σcont(k)
)
which are used to generate the number of induced infection for each day t.
The other characteristics of the individual k include age variable agek as well
as, the infectivity parameters such as radius radk up to which the individual
can infect the other individuals and probability pcont(k) of infecting other individuals during each day. In summary, the entire vector of characteristics
for individual k has the form:

The model initial cases are generated based on the first subset of reported
cases up to a certain reported date. Within the model multiple circular local
geographic epicenters E = {E1 , E2 , . . . , EI } are characterized by the center coordinates and the corresponding radius Ri for i = 1, 2, . . . , I where
each Ei represents a local epicenter and I is the total number of epicenters.
The epicenters are used to model geographic areas of the infection introduction into the population and the center coordinates that correspond to
the centroid regions that are defined from the available epidemiological data.
For Ukraine they are defined from administrative and surveillance data that
are available for cities and districts. In addition to the local disease introduction epicenters, the model incorporates areas of high population density
P = {P1 , P2 , . . . , PJ }. Those centers are characterized by the center coordinates and the corresponding radius Rj for j = 1, 2, . . . , J where each Pj
represents a large city or another densely populated area and J is the total
number of such areas.
The set of reported cases and the corresponding time slots is divided
into two subsets based on the reporting dates. The first set of indexes and
corresponding cases are used to define the model input and related conditions.
The second set of indexes and corresponding cases are used for both the model
calibration (i.e. finding the set of parameters when the difference between the
model-produced outputs and the reported data is the smallest possible) and
for the model validation (i.e. comparing the remaining reported cases that
are not used for calibration with the aligned with model-produced outputs
for the model justification).
The Ukrainian surveillance data were obtained from the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine web site [43]. The reports by region
were available daily since the beginning of the epidemic in March 2020. The
smallest geographic resolution of the data has been an administrative district
called ”oblast” in Ukrainian. Data for those geographic regions that are not
under the control of the Ukrainian government have not been reported by the
National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine and have not been used
in the subsequent modeling [43]. The first confirmed case in Ukraine was
reported on March 3, 2020 and was a Ukrainian who has recently returned
from Italy, while the first death was reported on March 13, 2020 [44][40].
The Ukrainian government has started to implement quarantine measure on

March 12, 2020 [40]. Those measures were slightly softened on April 24,
2020 and many services resumed even though the quarantine itself lasted till
the end of June 2020 [40]. The initially reported cases from March 12, 2020
until April 12, 2020 represented the first set of cases and were retrospectively
stochastically incorporated into the model as the model initial conditions [41].
For the second set of reported cases the model-produced outputs from April
22, 2020 until July 12, 2020 were used for model calibration, while the outputs
from July 13, 2020 until August 1, 2020 were used for model validation and
comparison with the reported data. The optimization of model parameters
has been performed by minimizing the sum of squared differences between
the model-produced outputs (across multiple runs) and the reported calibration data by using the Nelder–Mead numerical minimization method [45].
Due to the implemented quarantine by the Ukrainian government the model
fit was performed with the assumption that reduced transmission probability
parameters were used during the model fitting period. The August 1, 2020
modeling end date has been selected to be in agreement with the available
genomic data acquisition times [46] and to be conclusive for the first epidemic
wave progression in the immunity-naive population. The population basic reproduction number R0 [42] which is a characteristic of the entire epidemic at
early stages has been estimated from the model-produced distribution quantiles (5%, median, 95%) of the reproduction numbers of individuals within
the model and summarized across multiple stochastic runs.
The additional details about the model formulation, parametrization, and
calibration methods have been presented earlier [41] while the corresponding
model code and the tool for the Ukrainian epidemic have been made public
on GitHub [47].
2.2. Genomic Epidemiology Analysis
SARS-CoV-2 genomes together with the corresponding sampling times
were extracted from GISAID [46] database on January 14, 2021. Among
them in total 60 high-quality Ukrainian sequences suitable for genomic analysis have been identified and used for the analysis. The sampling range for
available Ukrainian sequences was from April 24, 2020 to August 7, 2020.
The first analysis part was the identification of virus introductions into
the country and within-country transmission clusters. For this part a maximum likelihood phylogeny was constructed using Nextstrain build for SARSCoV-2 [48] with the default country-specific subsampling settings [49]. The
Nextstrain algorithm selected a representative subsample of 6479 GISAID

sequences which included Ukrainian sequences, the sequences with close
genomes, as well as a representative subsample of sequences from other geographic regions. Besides the time-labeled phylogeny Nextstrain was used
to infer global genomic lineages and regional ancestral states. In the phylogenetic tree constructed by Nextstrain, the Ukrainian transmission clusters
were identified as clades with the most recent common ancestors (MRCA)
estimated as originating from Ukraine.
The second analysis part was the phylodynamic analysis which was performed using BEAST v1.10.4 [50] for 60 Ukrainian sequences. The strict
molecular clock, HKY+Γ nucleotide substitution model and a tree prior with
exponential growth coalescent were used for BEAST model settings. Parameters as evolutionary rate (clock.rate), population size, growth rate were adjusted in BEAUti v 1.10.4 with following priors as CTMC Rate Reference,
LogNormal[1.0, 2.0], Laplace[0, 100], respectively. Other parameters were
used with default prior settings. The model parameters were estimated by
using 10,000,000 iterations (steps) of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods with sampling at each 1000 steps, deleting the initial 10 % as burnin. MCMC behaviour was satisfactory with reasonable effective sample sizes
above 200 calculated by Tracer v1.10.4. [51].
For the three largest clusters identified by Nextstrain, separate phylogenies were constructed, and an exponential growth rates f of the infected
population size had been estimated for each phylogeny using BEAST with
the same parameter settings that were used for all 60 sequences described
earlier. These three separate estimates fˆ were used for the estimation of
the basic reproduction numbers R0 , that were alternatives to the one from
the transmission model described earlier. The estimates of the basic reproduction numbers R0 from genomic data were produced with the assumption
that SARS-CoV-2 generation intervals (i.e. times between infection onset
and onward transmission) were gamma-distributed [52]. The estimates of
R0 from genomic data were derived using the formula [53][54][55][56]:

where µ̂ and σ̂ were the estimates of mean and standard deviation of the
aforementioned gamma distribution of SARS-CoV-2 viral population. The
values µ̂ = 5.20 and σ̂ = 1.72 were taken as estimates from the literature [57].

region (µ̂ = 3.95 and σ̂ = 1.51) were also considered but the estimates of
R0 did not change by much. The results are summarized for those pairs of
estimates.
The corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals for R0 were produced separately for each cluster. Since the formula (2) defines a strictly monotone
transformation of f , the application of this transformation to both sides of
95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals produced by BEAST for f
results in desired 95% uncertainty bounds for R0 .

3.1. Agent-based Stochastic Model
In addition to the model fit to the reported data two alternative simulation scenarios were considered with later quarantine implementation dates.
The first scenario corresponds to output of the model that has been calibrated based on the reported data. The other two scenarios correspond to
hypothetical simulation scenarios which could have happened provided the
quarantine measures were implemented one (on April 19, 2020) and two (on
April 26, 2020) weeks later after the model initialization time (i.e. April 12,
2020). The visual results of first scenario model fit and the corresponding
outputs are summarized in Figure 1. Blue curves in Figure 1. correspond
to the reported data. They are captured by the model fits which is also
indicated by the corresponding median and 90% pointwise model prediction
bands across five hundred runs. The calibration interval is highlighted by
green background. The model-produced values outside the calibration interval (i.e. after July 12, 2020) are still in a good agreement with the reported
data which indicate the predicting abilities of the model [41].
For each of the three considered scenarios the median value across five
hundred simulations were computed at each time point and presented together with the corresponding 5-th and 95-th percentiles across five hundred
stochastic realizations to form the 90% prediction intervals. The corresponding results are summarized in Tables 1. and 2. for the model-predicted cases
and deaths, respectively. The three scenario summaries from Table 1. can
be directly compared. For the first (fitted) scenario on June 1, 2020 the
model predicts 25, 619 cumulative cases (with the 90% PI (20, 644; 30, 694)),
for the second scenario the model predicts 30, 321 cumulative cases (with
the 90% PI (24, 345; 35, 932)), and for the third scenario the model predicts

35, 396 cumulative cases (with the 90% PI (28, 999; 42, 343)). For comparison, the actual number of reported cases by June 1, 2020 was 24, 012 [43]. On
August 1, 2020 for the first (fitted) scenario the model predicts 70, 749 cumulative cases (with the corresponding 90% PI (49, 131; 92, 805)), for the second
scenario the model predicts 85, 929 cumulative cases (with the corresponding 90% PI (59, 992; 109, 638)), and for the third scenario the model predicts
104, 795 cumulative cases (with the corresponding 90% PI (78, 394; 132, 849)).
For comparison the actual number of reported cases by August 1, 2020 was
71, 056 [43] which validates the model fit since August 1, 2020 was outside
of the calibration interval. The second and third scenarios produce larger
number of cases in comparison to the first fitted scenario. The median estimates can be compared directly. For example the second scenario results in
18% predicted increase in cumulative number of cases on June 1, 2020 and in
21% predicted increase in cumulative number of cases on August 1, 2020 in

comparison to the first scenario. The third scenario results in 38% predicted
increase in cumulative number of cases on June 1, 2020 and in 48% predicted
increase in cumulative number of cases on August 1, 2020 when compared to
the first scenario.
The same summaries can be produced for the median number of deaths in
Table 2. For the first (fitted) scenario on June 1, 2020 the model predicts 602
cumulative death (with the 90% PI (501; 716)) while the actual number of
reported cases by June 1, 2020 was 718 [43]. On August 1, 2020 for the first
(fitted) scenario the model predicts 1, 757 cumulative death (with the corresponding 90% PI (1, 243; 2, 285)) and the actual number of reported cases
by August 1, 2020 was 1, 709 [43]. This also validates the model predicting
abilities since August 1, 2020 was outside of the calibration interval. The
second (simulated) scenario results in 18% increase in cumulative number of
deaths predicted on June 1, 2020 and in 22% increase in cumulative number
of deaths predicted on August 1, 2020. The third (simulated) scenario results
in 36% increase in cumulative number of deaths predicted on June 1, 2020
and in 49% increase in cumulative number of deaths predicted on August 1,
2020.

quarantine measures which cause the reduction in transmission probability
parameters and, therefore, a reduction in the number of cases, and (more
importantly) deaths. At the same time the results for the non-quarantine
scenarios should be interpreted as sensitivity analysis since the Ukrainian
government has implemented quarantine measures from the beginning of the
epidemic and there were no data to estimate non-quarantine transmission
probability parameters. This non-quarantine probability parameters have
been adopted from the previous analysis [41] so the scenarios two and three
correspond to hypothetical scenarios. The population basic reproduction
number R0 estimates from the first scenario were 0.881 (median) and 0.870
(mean) with the corresponding 90% confidence interval from gentiles equal
to (0.21; 1.53).
3.2. Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2
For the research described in the first part of genomic methods the phylogenetic tree of 6479 global SARS-CoV-2 sequences (that include Ukrainian)
has been constructed and presented in panels A and B of Figure 2.
The sequences were evaluated using a proposed classification [58]. The
corresponding lineages of SARS-CoV-2 had the following distribution: B1
- 19 sequences, B1.1.127 - 14 sequence, B1.1.29 - 10 sequence, B.1.1.243
- 5 sequences, B.1.1.247 - 3 sequences, B.1.1.208 - 2 sequences, and single sequence for B.1.1.167, B.1.1.194, B.1.1.220, B.1.1.238, B.1.1.257, and
B.1.131. Based on the proposed classification [58] analyzed lineages from
Ukraine belong to lineage B.
At the same time according to the build-in Nextstrain classification [48]
the analyzed SARS-CoV-2 variants from Ukraine belong to lineages 19A,
20A and 20B. The corresponding lineages of SARS-CoV-2 had the following
distribution: 19A - 1 sequence (1, 67%), 20A - 31 sequence (51, 67%) and
20B - 28 sequences (46, 67%). Those lineages are visualized on a global tree
in panel B of Figure 2.
Eight intra-Ukrainian transmission clusters with at least two sequences in
each of them have been identified on a global tree and summarized in Figures
A1-A8 in Appendix. Cluster seven contained three sequences which have
been phylogenetically close, but the MRCA from Ukraine was only confirmed
on a Ukrainian tree but was not confirmed on a global tree. Therefore, based
on available data, there is no way to say for sure whether it has indeed been
a cluster.

The largest three clusters are presented in Figure 3. The presence of
such distinct clusters suggests multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into
Ukraine. This agrees well with the virus introduction patterns observed in
other countries [59], and emphasizes the contribution of global movement of
people to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2.
For the research described in the second part of genomic methods the
phylodynamic analysis of Ukrainian sequences has been performed. This
analysis allowed the estimation of timelines of the eight largest cluster introductions to the country and the comparison of those timelines with the
timeline of the viral control measures applied in Ukraine. The inferred phylogeny is depicted in Figure 4 with MRCAs of the eight clusters highlighted
as green circles. The vertical red bar time separator in Figure 4 corresponds
to the formal quarantine date introduction in Ukraine i.e. to March 12, 2020
[40] [60]. The formal quarantine date followed by the closure of the country’s
land borders and a ban on foreign citizens’ entry on March 16, 2020 [61] and
the closure of international air, rail and bus services on March 17, 2020 [62].
Times to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the identified
eight clusters are in the range from January 28, 2020 to June 4, 2020 which
is visually summarized in Figure 5. TMRCAs of four clusters (50%) fall
before the announced quarantine date, and the sequences from these clusters

TMRCA after the quarantine date with numbers 4,5,7, and 8 constitute 20%
(9 sequences) of observed clustered Ukrainian coronavirus population which
is visualized in a pie chart in Figure 5. The remaining 15 sequences (not
shown) did no cluster with any other Ukrainian sequences on the global tree
(not shown due to tree complexity). There is not enough information in
the available samples to make strong statements about the roles of those
sequences in transmission. The analysis findings support the hypothesis that
the public health measures taken to control the virus spread in Ukraine did
not have a decreasing effect on the viral population numbers. The conclusion
came from the fact that four MRCAs were estimated to form before the
actual quarantine date and later gave a rise to 60% of analyzed Ukrainian
SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
The estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 are summarized in
Table 3. The estimates R̂0 are presented together with the corresponding

4. Discussion
In this study, the authors have detailed the epidemic characteristics of
the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ukraine, evaluated effects of
timely interventions, and characterized the genomic diversity of circulating
viral strains. In contrast to previous coronavirus epidemics, the decreased
case fatality rate and presence of asymptomatic transmission has resulted
in unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 and a renewed public interest in
infectious disease epidemiology [63][64]. It has also provided mathematical modelers an opportunity to explore the effects of varying levels of human connectivity, population density, and different types and intensity of
non-pharmacologic interventions [64][65]. With such heterogeneity, we argue that is crucial to rely on stochastic modeling frameworks, such as the
one presented in this paper, to evaluate the impact of critical public health
decisions in mitigating the effects of this pandemic [66].
To the authors knowledge this is the first paper to characterize the population structure of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in Ukraine. Aside from
human factors, the population structure was largely dependent on the number of viral introductions and founder genetics along with differences in the
transmissibility of novel variants [67] [68]. For Ukraine, the genomic data
analysis results suggest that there have been at least eight introductions of
SARS-CoV-2 into Ukraine during the first wave despite the quarantine; four
of which occurred after the implementation of quarantine. Unlike quantifying the reduction in incidence, the effect of non-pharmacologic interventions
on the genetic diversity is less straightforward [69]. Intuitively, that the earliest possible quarantine date has the potential to reduce the number of new
introductions, however on a population level, they contribute only a small
fraction to the overall incidence [70]. Just as planning non-pharmacologic
interventions, the ability to infer transmission patterns via genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analyses will prove critical to ongoing development of
vaccines as the virus continues to evolve [71][72].
The findings from this paper are of course not without limitations. As one
of the poorest countries in Europe (based on GDP per capita) much of the
health care infrastructure in Ukraine lacks the resources of its neighbors [73].
Both availability of screening tests and the reporting of incidence data during
the initial epidemic likely underestimated the burden of disease. Likewise, as
the pandemic evolved, the scarcity of genetic sequencing limited the number
of sequence comparison in the phylogenetic analysis. As such, the number of

actual viral clusters remains unknown and should be interpreted as at least
eight clusters. The findings however, do provide a clear indication of a local
transmission within Ukraine and were useful to establish a timeline for viral
introduction.
In summary, this study was among the first to explore the characteristics
of the initial pandemic as it spread to Ukraine and provided additional genomic analyses not previously published. Not only does the use of the local
stochastic model support the efficacy of non-pharmacologic measures such as
quarantine to reduce the spread of illness, it demonstrated that even small
delays in implementation can have large effects on the number of future cases.
