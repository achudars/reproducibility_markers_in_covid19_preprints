Abstract

27

Background SARS-CoV-2 serology tests are clinically useful to document a prior SARS-

28

CoV-2 infection in patients with no or inconclusive PCR results and suspected COVID-19

29

disease or sequelae. Data are urgently needed to select the assays with optimal sensitivity at

30

acceptable specificity.

31

Methods A comparative analysis of analytical sensitivity was performed of seven commercial

32

SARS-CoV-2 serology assays on 171 sera from 135 subjects with PCR-confirmed SARS-

33

CoV-2 infection, composed of 71 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and 64

34

healthcare workers with paucisymptomatic infections. The kinetics of IgA/IgM/IgG

35

seroconversion to viral N- and S-protein epitopes were studied from 0 to 54 days after

36

symptom onset. Specificity was verified on 57 pre-pandemic samples.

37

Results Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test

38

achieved a superior overall sensitivity. Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and EUROIMMUN

39

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 combined IgG/IgA also showed acceptable sensitivity (>95%) versus the

40

consensus result of all assays from 10 days post symptom onset. Optimal specificity (>98%)

41

was achieved only by Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay

42

and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab rapid test. LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG showed a

43

significantly lower sensitivity as compared to all other assays. Lack of seroconversion by any

44

test was seen in 1.4% of hospitalized and 4.7% of paucisymptomatic infections. Within 10

45

days from symptom onset, only the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA has acceptable

46

sensitivity.

47

Conclusions Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays are

48

suitable for sensitive and specific screening of a SARS-CoV-2 infection from 10 days after

49

symptom onset.

Brief summary

51

There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serology tests for the sensitive and specific

52

detection of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection as a complementary diagnostic tool to molecular

53

testing. Various commercial assays are becoming available but comparison of their relative

54

performance is difficult unless they are head-to-head evaluated. Here we compared seven

55

commercial assays on sera equally composed of mild and severe PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-

56

2 infections. Our analysis indicates a superior performance of the Wantai SARS-COV-2

57

ELISA for total antibodies to the S-RBD domain. Also, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay

58

for total antibodies to the N-protein shows good performance for high-throughput screening.

Introduction

62

The gold standard for diagnosis of COVID-19 lung disease is nucleic acid amplification

63

testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus-specific sequences coding for the spike (S), envelope (E) and

64

nucleocapsid (N) proteins, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene and the Open

65

Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1ab) region (1). The diagnostic sensitivity of the most commonly

66

used technique, RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs is currently unknown. When compared to

67

chest CT analysis of lesions characteristic for viral pneumonia, estimates vary from lower

68

than 70% to 90% (2,3) likely depending on COVID-19 disease stage, the intensity of viral

69

replication, sampling quality and analytical properties of the amplification assay. In addition,

70

insufficient PCR capacity during peak infection rate in overwhelmed healthcare systems left

71

many patients with milder clinically suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as

72

asymptomatic infections untested.

73

Serology testing for COVID-19, defined as the detection of IgM, IgA or IgG antibodies to

74

SARS-CoV-2-specific epitopes, might represent an interesting complementary diagnostic tool

75

to document a past SARS-CoV-2 infection, both in individual patients with suspected

76

COVID-19 symptoms or late-stage complications who had no (conclusive) PCR test as at

77

population level to guide infection control policies. In addition, measuring SARS-CoV-2

78

antibodies might harbor prognostic value and convey information on protective immunity in

79

vaccination trials.

80

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus (βCoV), belonging to

81

the Coronaviridae family. All human coronaviruses share four major structural proteins:

82

envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 shares a 80% overall

83

nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV (4–6). In SARS-CoV, the spike- and nucleocapsid

84

protein contain the highest density of B-cell epitopes (7,8) and in silico analysis indicated that

85

dominant B-cell epitopes share 69% to 100% homology to SARS-CoV-2. It was therefore a

86

logical choice of many commercial developers of diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 serology kits to

87

target the S and N proteins. In addition to their diagnostic value, antibodies to the S protein,

88

composed of a S1 subunit with the receptor binding domain (RBD) and a S2 subunit that

89

mediates membrane fusion for viral entry, appear additionally interesting because of their

90

proposed correlation with neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity to both SARS-CoV

91

(6) and, based on emerging data, also to SARS-CoV-2 (9,10).

92

Data on the kinetics of the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 are rapidly emerging

93

but questions remain as to the relative diagnostic sensitivity of various commercial assays. In

94

this study we present a cross-platform comparison of seven commercially available SARS-

95

CoV-2 serology assays, targeting both N and S protein epitopes and different combinations of

96

antibody isotypes in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients both with critical and mild disease

97

course at various time points. To select assays suitable for screening the general population,

98

we used as working definition of acceptable performance a sensitivity > 95% versus the

99

consensus result of all tests also in mild SARS-CoV-2 infections from 10 days after onset of

100

symptoms and a minimal specificity of 98%.

Methods

103

Patients This is a diagnostic accuracy study on serum samples obtained from the following

104

cohorts: (i) Hospitalized COVID-19 patients: 105 serum samples obtained at different time

105

points from 71 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and admitted for severe

106

COVID-19 pneumonia from March 1 to April 27, 2020 at AZ Delta General Hospital in

107

Roeselare, Belgium; (ii) Paucisymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections: 66 serum samples from

108

64 healthcare workers with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, PCR-confirmed after developing fever

109

and World Health Organization (WHO)-listed COVID-19 symptoms. These patients were

110

home-quarantined without the need for hospitalization; (iii) Suspected SARS-CoV-2

infection: 84 serum samples from 84 healthcare workers from AZ Delta General Hospital,

112

Roeselare and Sint-Andries Hospital, Tielt who presented WHO-listed COVID-19 symptoms

113

but were not tested by PCR mainly due to restrictive national test indications at the time. The

114

study was approved by the AZ Delta ethical committee with a waiver of informed consent

115

from the hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Clinical Trial Number IRB B1172020000009) and

116

with written informed consent from participants with paucisymptomatic and suspected SARS-

117

CoV-2 infections (Clinical Trial Number B1172020000006).

118

The specificity was analyzed on a panel composed of 57 pre-pandemic serum samples

119

obtained from patients with PCR-confirmed infection by other HCoV respiratory viruses

120

(n=7), other pathogens and viruses (n=42) or presence of auto-immune antibodies (n=8)

SARS-CoV-2 serology assays

124

All serology assays were used according to the manufacturers’ protocol using the cutoffs

125

specified in the package inserts as detailed below.

126

Rapid tests The COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co., Ltd.,

127

Zhejiang, China) is a solid phase immunochromatographic assay for the qualitative detection

128

of IgM and IgG antibodies to recombinant N- and S-proteins. The Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab

129

Test (Innovita Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) is a colloidal gold lateral flow

130

assay for the qualitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies to undisclosed SARS-CoV-2

131

epitopes. Rapid tests were considered positive if a line was observed for either IgM, IgG or

132

both. The intensity of the color was not evaluated.

136

RBD domain of the S1 protein. Samples with a cutoff ratio (OD/CO with cutoff = mean of

137

three blanks + 0.16) higher than 0.9 were considered positive, classifying gray zone results

138

0.9-1.1 as positive. Three indirect ELISAs from EUROIMMUN AG (a PerkinElmer

139

Company, Luebeck, Germany) were tested: the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA assays for

140

semiquantitative detection of IgA and IgG antibodies against the S1 protein and Anti-SARS-

141

CoV-2-NCP(IgG) assay for semiquantitative detection of IgG to the N protein. (cutoff = 0.8

142

units, classifying gray zone results 0.8-1.1 units as positive). All ELISAs were tested using

143

the PhD™ system (Version EIA 0_16, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, California).

144
145

Electrochemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA) The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay for

146

Cobas e601 module (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) is a double-antigen sandwich

147

assay for the qualitative detection of all antibody isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG) against the N

148

protein (cutoff = 1 Cutoff Index) LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (DiaSorin, Saluggia,

149

Italy) is an indirect CLIA for the quantitative detection of IgG antibodies against S1/S2

150

proteins (cutoff = 12 AU/mL, classifying gray zone results between 12 and 15 AU/mL as

151

positive).

152
153

SARS-CoV-2 PCR was done using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea)

154

for E/N/RdRP genes on nasopharyngeal swab.

155
156

Statistical analysis

157

Statistical analyses were performed using MedCalc (version 12.2.1, Belgium). The sensitivity

158

of serology tests was evaluated on samples obtained from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive

159

patients as (i) total fraction of samples showing detectable antibodies and (ii) by comparing

160

each individual assay versus the consensus outcome obtained by the majority of all assays

evaluated in this study. Diagnostic test (2x2) was used for calculation of sensitivity and

162

specificity. Chi-squared (χ2) test was used for comparing proportions for categorical

163

variables. Not-normally quantitative variables are expressed as medians (IQR) and Mann-

164

Whitney test was used to test statistical differences between various timeframes after

165

symptom onset. Differences were considered statistically significant if P-value was <0.05.

166

Kinetics of seroconversion in individual patients in Fig. 1 were fitted to a scale from -1 to +1

167

with 0 representing each assays cutoff by subtracting each assay’s cutoff from its raw data

168

signals, and dividing its absolute value by the highest (lowest) cutoff-corrected signal for that

169

assay obtained in our data set for positive (negative) samples. Figure 2 was created in Python

170

3.7.7. The packages numpy (1.18.4), pandas (1.0.3) and matplotlib (3.2.1) were used to

171

process the data and generate the plot. The labels were optimized using LaTeX (3.14159265-

172

2.6-1.40.20).

Results

175

Analytical specificity

176

The specificity was evaluated on 57 pre-pandemic samples from individuals infected with

177

other HCoV viruses (229E/HKU1/OC43), other infectious agents or with positivity to anti-

178

nuclear factor or rheumatoid factor (detailed in Supplementary Table 1). The Wantai SARS-

179

COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2

180

IgG and Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab Test all achieved 100% specificity (Table 1). The

181

EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test

182

showed the lowest specificity (91.1% and 92.9% respectively) and were the only to cross-

183

react with common cold HCoV viruses. LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (96.4%

184

specificity) was the only to show interference by rheumatoid factor (Supplementary table 1).

Analytical sensitivity

187

Study participants Analytical sensitivities were compared on 171 samples obtained from 135

188

subjects, all with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, pooled or grouped in two distinct

189

cohorts: hospitalized and paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Hospitalized patients

190

included 105 samples from 71 patients who were hospitalized for severe COVID-19 disease,

191

all with a very high level of suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT (CO-RADS

192

score =5) (11): 48 males (median age 65 years, IQR 53-80) and 23 females (median age 9

193

years, IQR 67-86). Serum samples ranged from 0 to 39 days after patient-reported symptom

194

onset. Paucisymptomatic patients: 66 samples from 64 healthcare workers with mild (n=61)

195

or no (n=3) WHO-listed COVID-19 symptoms: myalgia (present in 62.5%), fever (60.9%),

196

dry cough (56.2%), dyspnea (40.6%), severe fatigue (35.9%), headaches (30.0%), loss of

197

smell or taste (26.6%) or diarrhea (18.8%). None of these patients were hospitalized. Serum

198

samples ranged from 11 to 54 days after patient-reported symptom onset.

199
200

Analytical sensitivity was evaluated in two ways, in all samples pooled and separately for the

201

hospitalized and paucisymptomatic patients. First, versus SARS-CoV-2 PCR (100% of

202

samples from PCR+ patients) as reference, by measuring the percentage of samples showing

203

antibody titers above the respective assay’s cutoff (Table 1). Second, by comparing each

204

individual assay to the consensus outcome of the majority of seven tested assays (Table 2).

205

The results were congruent. The Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA showed the highest overall

206

sensitivity: 86.4% (95%CI 80.3-91.2) versus PCR and 100% (95%CI 97.3-100) versus the

207

consensus result at all time points in in both patient cohorts. Its sensitivity was significantly

208

higher (P<0.05) than all other assays with exception of the Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM

209

Rapid Test and the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA combined. In a real-

210

world clinical setting, serology assays will be mostly used at later time stages e.g. more than

211

20 days after symptom onset or to document past SARS-CoV-2 infection in

212

paucisymptomatic patients: in these patients four assays show clinically acceptable sensitivity

213

above 95% versus the consensus result (Table 2): Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys

214

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA combined and

215

Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG

216

showed a significantly (P<0.05) lower sensitivity compared to all other assays: with a

217

sensitivity versus consensus (Table 2) of 83.6% (95%CI 72.5-91.5) at > 20 days post

218

symptom onset and of 84.2% (95%CI 72.1-92.5) in paucisymptomatic patients, performance

219

is suboptimal. Also, the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP(IgG) and Innovita 2019-

220

nCoV Ab Test suffered from limited sensitivity.

221
222

Kinetics of seroconversion We directly compared the kinetics of seroconversion of the

223

ELISA/CLIA assays on consecutive blood samples of 8 patients admitted to intensive care

224

units (Figure 1): in all 8 patients, the RBD-targeting Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA was

225

the first to detect seroconversion, followed by the S1-targeting EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-

226

CoV-2 IgA. Of the N-targeting assays, the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP(IgG)

227

detected seroconversion more rapidly than the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. The

228

LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG typically was the last to detect seroconversion. The

229

kinetics were additionally studied by a pooled analysis in samples from different patients,

230

grouped according to the timeframe after symptom onset ranging from < 10 days, 10 to 20

231

days or more than 20 days post onset of symptoms (dpos) (Table 1-2). All tests except Wantai

232

SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA showed a significantly higher positivity rate between 10 and 20

233

dpos as compared to less than 10 dpos (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in

234

positivity rates between 10 and 20 and more than 20 dpos (Table 1) indicating that serology

235

testing can be performed starting from 10 days after symptom onset. In samples less than 10

236

days after symptom onset, all from hospitalized patients, the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab

237

ELISA outperformed all other assays, with a sensitivity of 75.5% (95%CI 61.7-86.2) versus

238

PCR and 100% (95%CI 88.1-100) versus consensus that was however significantly lower

239

than its performance in samples > 20 days dpos (P<0.05).

240
241

Concordance analysis of humoral immune response on individual samples We visually

242

plotted the concordance of presence or absence of antibodies to RBD/S1/S2/N proteins across

243

the various assays in all samples and grouped according to disease severity as function of time

244

post symptom onset (Figure 2). For the assays with acceptable overall sensitivity > 95%

245

(Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, EUROIMMUN Anti-

246

SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA combined and Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test) a

247

good overall concordance was seen in samples > 10 dpos, with 87.7% and 3.5% of samples

248

positive or negative respectively with all four methods. No clear differences were observed in

249

the kinetics of appearance of antibodies to S or N epitopes. Beyond 10 days, only 1.4% (1/71)

250

of hospitalized and 4.7% (3/64) paucisymptomatic patients developed no antibodies.

251
252

Screening of healthcare workers with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection Finally we selected the

253

most performant serology test (Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA) to screen a cohort of 84

254

healthcare workers who failed to obtain a PCR test during peak infection but retrospectively

255

self-reported following COVID-19 symptoms: myalgia (present in 23.8%), fever (21.4%), dry

256

cough (29.8%), dyspnea (20.2%), severe fatigue (14.3%), headaches (5.6%), loss of smell or

257

taste (9.5%) or diarrhea (14.3%): 26.2% showed detectable antibodies as compared to national

258

survey data of 8.4% in unselected healthcare workers and 4.3% in the healthy blood donors at

259

in the same timeframe (Sciensano, Belgian serosurveillance data, sampling from May 6-10,

260

2020).

In this study we report on the performance characteristics of seven commercially available

264

serology tests for detection of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (S-RBD total

265

antibodies, S1/S2 IgG, S1 IgA and IgG), the N protein (N total antibodies, N IgG), and both

266

proteins (N/S IgM and IgG). This study is the first to report performance of Elecsys Anti-

267

SARS-CoV-2 assay on the Cobas e601 module. We specifically investigated their relative

268

value as a complementary diagnostic tool to screen for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in

269

individuals that were not (conclusively) tested by PCR in early stage of active viral replication

270

up to 10 days after onset of symptoms. As working definition for acceptable performance, we

271

propose that such assay should combine a minimal sensitivity of 95% versus a consensus

272

estimate and a high specificity above 98% in samples taken 20 days or more after symptom

273

onset, also in subjects who experienced mild SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. Based on these

274

criteria, the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and the

275

Innovita 2019-nCoV Ab Test all showed acceptable specificity. In terms of sensitivity versus

276

the consensus result obtained by all tests, the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA, the Elecsys

277

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG combined with IgA and

278

the Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test are acceptable. Overall, only the Wantai

279

SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay reached the proposed

280

acceptance criteria, with the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA clearly outperforming all other

281

evaluated assays.

282

A strength of our study is that the parallel evaluation of several kits allowed a reliable direct

283

comparison of diagnostic performance using the cutoffs provided by the manufacturers. Also,

284

our patient cohorts, including not only severe COVID-19 patients but also a sizeable cohort of

285

mild SARS-CoV-2 infections provides a good estimate on the assays’ performances in the

286

intended target population. We observed no notable differences in the rate of seroconversion

287

between severe and milder SARS-CoV-2 infections, nor in its timing.

288

The limitations of our study are that the specificity analysis requires further extension,

289

particularly with time series analyzing false positive seroconversion triggered by other HCoV

290

(229E/HKU1/OC43/NL63) during the common cold season, and that our study did not

291

include a sizeable cohort of fully asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Our study also

292

focused on qualitative analysis and did not investigate differences in assays’ performance for

293

quantification of antibody titers. In critically ill COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 antibody

294

levels were reported to correlate to disease severity (4) by triggering bradykinin and

295

complement activation pathways. The assays evaluated here show large variations in their

296

dynamic range (raw data in Supplementary Information), ranging from a good linearity for the

297

LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (12) to a limited dynamic range with rapid signal

298

saturation for the most sensitive: with a sample volume input of 100 μL that is 10-20 times

299

higher than the other evaluated assays, the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA is clearly

300

designed towards high sensitivity by maximal antibody capture. Caution is thus warranted

301

when comparing (semi)quantitative estimates of antibody titers across platforms before

302

certified standards with known titers become available.

303

Our data are compatible with other cross-platform evaluations (13) indicating superior

304

performance of the Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA as compared to EUROIMMUN Anti-

305

SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA. Our data are, however, discrepant with another study reporting a

306

sensitivity of 100% and 99% specificity for the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (12),

307

obtained on a small set of 125 samples including only 40 PCR-confirmed patients and after

308

ROC-optimization of assay cutoffs. Since we observed considerable lot-to-lot variations in the

309

raw signals of the two LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG kits tested, we feel that caution is

310

warranted and cutoffs should only be optimized on better powered data sets and proper

311

assessment of different lots.

312

It was reported that antibodies against S protein appear later in infection than antibodies

313

against the N protein (4,7). We also observed faster seroconversion of N- versus S1-targeting

314

IgG in the EUROIMMUN assays. On the other hand, we also observed a much faster

315

seroconversion of total antibodies (IgA/IgM/IgG) to S-RBD (Wantai) than N-protein

316

(Elecsys). Within the same epitope/assay format (EUROIMMUN to S1), IgA antibodies

317

clearly precede IgG. IgM does not precede IgG as evident from both rapid tests. Overall, our

318

data suggest that speed of seroconversion depends more on assay design, recombinant viral

319

epitope and antibody isotypes covered, and that overall sensitivity is likely enhanced when

320

both IgA and IgG isotypes are measured.

321

In conclusion, our study supports the clinical use of both Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA

322

and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay for sensitive and specific screening of SARS-CoV-2

323

antibodies from 10 days after symptom onset. Within 10 days after symptom onset, only

324

Wantai SARS-COV-2 Ab ELISA achieves medically relevant diagnostic power.
