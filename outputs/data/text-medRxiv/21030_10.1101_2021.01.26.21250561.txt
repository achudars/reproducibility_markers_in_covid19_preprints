Summary

33
34

Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 have been vigorously analyzed. It has been

35

proposed that a subset of mild or asymptomatic cases with undetectable antibodies may clear

36

the virus in a T-cell cytotoxic-dependent manner, albeit recent data revealed the importance

37

of B-cells in that regard. We hypothesized that underdiagnosed antigenemia/viremia may

38

conceal humoral response possibly through immunocomplex formation. We report the first

39

case of late-onset seroconversion detected following decline in antigenemia/viremia levels.

40

Consequently, classification of at least a subset of COVID-19 cases as non-responders might

41

not represent a true immunobiological phenomenon, rather reflect antibody masking due to

42

prolonged antigenemia/viremia.

Introduction

52
53

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the culprit of an

54

ongoing pandemic, continues to engender detrimental effects on healthcare systems

55

worldwide leading to serious socioeconomic consequences. Following an incubation period

56

of 2-14 days infected individuals experience a heterogeneous clinical course of the so-called

57

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), ranging from asymptomatic infection to critical

58

illness1,2. Similarly, symptomatic infection comprises of a wide array of clinical

59

manifestations from localized disease affecting preferentially the respiratory and occasionally

60

the gastrointestinal tract, to multi-systemic organ involvement3,4.

61

The brisk induction of pro-inflammatory responses, the so-called cytokine storm

62

syndrome, is currently regarded as the major contributor of COVID-19-related multi-organ

63

dysfunction5. However, there is sparse evidence that contradicts this supposition, implying a

64

possible underestimated degree of viral-induced organ cytotoxicity6. Although the route of

65

viral dissemination to other organs is still a subject of debate, growing evidence suggests this

66

occurs haemotogenously4,5,7. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 viremia and antigenemia have only

67

been documented in disproportionally low rates than expected and the clinical significance of

68

their presence remains undetermined8–11.

69

Besides the role of viremia in COVID-19 pathogenesis, another ambiguous aspect of

70

the disease is the host’s immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and more specifically, the

71

diversity of the humoral response level among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Based on

72

currently available serological assays, it is evident that the majority of COVID-19 patients

73

seroconvert within 2 weeks post symptom onset (p.s.o), whereas delayed (beyond the 2nd

74

week p.s.o) or even absent antibody responses (non-responders) have also been documented

75

(Figure 1A)12. The latter is particularly true in asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic patients12.

76

This divergent pattern of humoral response has also been observed in the other two beta-

77

coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV)

78

as well as other viral strains, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) and human rhinoviruses12-

79

14

80

paradox which has neither been studied nor satisfactorily explained.

. This phenomenon of undetectable antibody titers following convalescence constitutes a

81

To explain this paradox in COVID-19, we sought to examine the hypothesis that the

82

presence of the virus and/or viral fragments (viremia and/or antigenemia) in the serum may

83

mask seroconversion. If this is true, then two conditions should be met: 1) viral RNA should

84

be detected in the blood stream, and 2) if the absence of seroconversion is due to

85

antigen/viral-mediated saturation of circulating antibodies (i.e immunocomplexes formation),

86

then the progressive decrease of antigenemia/viremia should be followed by increasingly

87

detectable antibody titers15. Herein, we report to the best of our knowledge, the first case as a

88

proof-of-concept supporting the proposed scenario.

89
90

Case presentation

91

We report the case of a young male in his 20’s who presented with a 24-hour history

92

of fever up to 38.4˚C, without any additional signs or symptoms (Figure 2A). Due to a recent

93

history of close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, nasopharyngeal swab from the

94

patient was obtained and tested for SARS-CoV-2 with reverse transcription polymerase chain

95

reaction (RT-PCR) on day 2 p.s.o, confirming the diagnosis (Cycle threshold value (Ct)=15).

96

Subsequently, the patient self-isolated at home for two weeks, as per national infection

97

control protocols. His fever subsided within a few days. Besides antipyretics, the patient did

98

not receive any other medications. However, upon completion of the two-weeks’ isolation,

99

low grade fever (up to 37.4˚C) recurred. A repeat RT-PCR test on day 15 p.s.o. was positive

100

(Ct=30) (Figure 2A). Fever finally resolved 25 days after symptom onset.

101

A series of serum samples for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were

102

collected at regular intervals (every 4-5 days) starting on day 6 p.s.o up to day 27 p.s.o,

103

followed by two additional samples on days 55 and 73 (Figure 2A), a timeframe that exceeds

104

the expected seroconversion window (Figure 1A).

Materials and Methods

107

Monoclonal antibody production

108

The monoclonal antibodies 480-S2 and 479-G2 used in the present immunoassays

109

have been generated by immunizing mice against the receptor binding domain (RBD) region

110

of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 via a modification of the method described by

111

Koehler and Milstein16. Following vigorous immunosorbent assay selection cycles, clones

112

exhibiting the required sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility were selected for

113

downstream applications as detailed below. These have been extensively validated (Figure

114

1B) and are under proprietary rights (patent application no.:22-0003846810).

High-binding plates precoated with 1.5μg/ml S-trimer (Trenzyme, GmBH, Germany)

118

were blocked with 300μl of 4% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) following incubation for 1

119

hour at Room Temperature (RT). Then, 50μl of serum samples were loaded in duplicates (1:1

120

dilution) and incubated at 4˚C overnight. Next, 50μL/well of S protein conjugated to

121

Horseradish Peroxidase (S-HRP) (5:12000 dilution) were loaded and incubated for 45

122

minutes at RT. After appropriate washing, 50μL/well of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine

123

(TMB) were added and let to incubate for 10 minutes at RT in the dark. Subsequently, 50μL

124

of phosphoric acid were used for reaction termination and the absorption was quantified

using a microplate reader at 450nm (cut-off value: 0.100). Washing was performed at

appropriate steps using Phosphate Buffer Saline/0.1% Tween (PBSTx5). Following testing

127

on 150 negative pre-COVID-19 and 250 RT-PCR positive samples, validation data revealed

128

90.5% sensitivity and 95% specificity (Suppl. Figure 1i).

129

Our ‘in house’ method was cross-referenced to an FDA-approved and independently

130

validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Euroimmun, Luebeck, GmBH,

131

Germany), by testing a panel of 321 anonymised samples (Pearson’s Chi-squared test with

132

Yates’ continuity correction; p-value=0.5288)17. With regards to the presented case, the only

133

discrepancy between the two ELISA methods was day 27 (2 weeks beyond the expected

134

seroconversion window) where Euroimmun was positive and ours was negative. Moreover,

135

antibody detection was tested by a commercially available Rapid Antigen Detection test, as

136

well (lateral flow technology by Prognosis, BIO-SHIELD 2019-NCOV IGG, Catalog

137

Sandwich ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection

140

High-binding plates precoated with 2μg/ml of monoclonal antibody 480-S2 were

141

blocked with 300μl of 4%BSA/0.05%Tween blocking buffer following incubation for 1 hour

142

at 37oC. Subsequently, 50μl of serum samples (1:1 dilution) were loaded in duplicates and

143

were allowed to incubate overnight at 4οC. Following adequate washes with PBST, 50μl of

144

secondary antibody 479-G2 solution labelled with HRP (G2-HRP at a concentration of

145

1:50000) were loaded into each well, and after a 30min incubation period at RT in the dark,

146

development of the signal was performed using 50μl of TMB substrate. Following a 10min

147

incubation time, equal volume of phosphoric acid was introduced to terminate the reaction

148

and signal was quantified as above (cut-off value: 0.100). Performance characteristics of the

149

test were calculated following testing on 100 samples (28 RT-PCR positive and 72 negative

Immunohistochemistry

154

Immunohistochemistry was performed using the anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal

155

antibody (479-G2). The Novolink Polymer Detection System (Leica Biosystems) was used

156

for development of the signal and hematoxylin for counterstaining (Figure 1B, Suppl.

157

Figure 2B). The specificity of the immunohistochemical signal was confirmed by 1) omitting

158

the primary antibody and 2) performing competition with the corresponding spike antigen

Results

186

Regarding the first assumption of our hypothesis, properly preserved serum from

187

confirmed COVID-19 patients was examined for the presence of viral RNA via RT-PCR.

188

Molecular analysis exhibited a positive result demonstrating that a patient was infected with a

189

previously uncharacterized strain showing 99% similarity with Wuhan-Hu-1 variant (Suppl.

190

Figure 1A, Suppl. Figure 3A), which is in line with evidence supporting its detection in the

191

blood8–11. Bioinformatic analysis of this variant revealed the presence of a series of amino

192

acid substitution including the D614G and A879S in the spike (S) protein (Suppl. Figure

193

3B). Subsequently, to test the second part of our assumption, validation of the produced

194

antibody was carried out in nasopharyngeal swabs, post-mortem material and serum from

195

confirmed COVID-19 patients. The appropriate negative controls were included in all three

196

settings. In swabs, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay reached the values of 96,5% and

197

99%, respectively (patent application no.:22-0003846810) (Suppl. Figure 1iii). Applying the

198

antibody in immunohistochemical assays, viral particles were detected in archival material

199

from lung tissues of COVID-19 patients19. The specificity of the immunohistochemical signal

200

was confirmed by 1) omitting the primary antibody and 2) performing competition with the

201

corresponding spike antigen (Figure 1B). Tissues from a large cohort of non-COVID-19

202

patients served as negative control20. Finally, the ‘in house’ sandwich ELISA assay for

203

antigen detection we developed (for sensitivity and specificity see Suppl. Figure 1ii),

204

identified viral antigens and/or the virus in serum of RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients

205

(antigenemia/viremia), whereas healthy individuals were negative.

206

Notably, our ‘in house’ sandwich ELISA assay for antigen detection revealed the

207

presence of the virus and/or its constituents in the serum of a patient with remarkably high

208

clinical suspicion of COVID-19 based on his clinical and laboratory findings (Figure 3A-E,

209

Suppl. Figure 2A). In this case, a definite clinical diagnosis was not made possible due to

210

lack of molecular confirmation by RT-PCR in a series of nasopharyngeal (5X) and even a

211

bronchoalveolar

212

immunohistochemical analysis of the lung tissue confirmed the viral infection (Figure 3F,

213

Suppl. Figure 2B). Overall, the above workflow demonstrated a) the robustness of the

antibody produced and b) that antigenemia/viremia may take place in a subset of COVID-19

215

patients.

Given that antigenemia/viremia may occur, we sought to examine whether our

working hypothesis stands in the presented case. Monitoring of the kinetics of the two

parameters under investigation showed a progressive decline of antigenemia/viremia that was

219

accompanied by a gradual increase of antibody titers resulting in evident seroconversion

220

beyond the expected seroconversion window. In the case of lateral flow testing,

seroconversion failed to be detected (Figure 2B).

224

Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 have challenged the scientific community

225

worldwide, mainly due to their high inter-individual variability2. Heightened immune

226

responses have been associated with adverse clinical outcomes while non-detectable ones,

227

characterize mainly asymptomatic and mild cases12,21. The absence of humoral immunity has

228

been attributed to various factors including variability in disease severity and host-related

229

characteristics22. With regards to the latter, augmented innate over adaptive immune

230

responses and/or a robust T-cell-mediated viral clearance are proposed as possible

231

explanations23. However, this notion was disputed by recent studies demonstrating presence

232

of dominant B-cell over T-cell responses irrespective of disease severity along with

233

longitudinal persistence in memory specific T- as well as B-cells in mild cases24,25. This

234

emphasizes the importance of humoral immunity in viral clearance and points towards a

235

different explanation, whilst raising an important question: does the phenomenon of non-

236

responders reflect a true immunobiological event or a limitation of currently available

237

diagnostic tools in precisely portraying the immune landscape?

238

According to a study comparing different antibody detecting assays, this observation

239

was reproducible by all methods, implying that absence of seroconversion represents a

240

biological rather than a technical issue22. To the contrary, serum of presumably non-

241

responders inhibited cell line infection upon culture with viable SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by

242

a neutralization assay, the gold standard for antibody efficiency12,23. The latter supports that a

243

technical limitation of the currently available diagnostic tools might be at play12.

244

Our findings suggest that delayed and/or absent kinetics of the antibody reaction is

245

most probably due to the prolonged and increased presence of the virus or its constituents

246

(spike antigen in the present case) in the serum, saturating the antibody response, thus

247

rendering antibody detection feasible only when antigenemia/viremia drops below a certain

248

threshold (Suppl. Figure 4). Similarly to the prolonged shedding seen in nasopharyngeal and

249

gastrointestinal tract secretions, it is likely that such an event could take place in the blood

250

stream, as well26. A probable source of antigenemia/viremia could be PANoptosis

251

(Pyroptosis, Apoptosis, Necroptosis), whereby cellular contents are released out of the cell

252

and into the circulation27. A similar explanation has been proposed for the presence of viral

253

RNA in the blood, reflecting a wash-out phenomenon from primary sites of infection9,28.

254

The take home message from the current effort is that antigenemia/viremia may affect

255

SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests of seemingly non-responders23. In this context, such a

256

phenomenon may lead to delay in or absence of seroconversion (negative result) secondary to

257

immune interference/competition due to immunocomplexes formation (Suppl. Figure 4)15. It

258

is likely that the ratio between antigens and immunoglobulins -rather the absolute values

259

there of- at a given timepoint during propagation of immune responses determines the result

260

of the immunodiagnostic method. As a result, such a confounding factor should be taken into

261

consideration when interpreting test results. Moreover, it could serve as a partial explanation

262

in discrepancies observed between various diagnostic tools monitoring antibody kinetics, as

263

demonstrated also in the presented case (Figure 2B)23,29. Therefore, immune response

264

monitoring should be evaluated in longer intervals to better estimate population

265

seroprevalence, thus designing tailored public health strategies (diagnostic algorithms). Such

266

strategies, within the context of vaccine shortage, could potentially include vaccination

267

prioritization of most vulnerable groups harboring little or no antibody protection against

268

SARS-CoV-2 re-infection30.

Supplementary Figure 4. A plausible explanation for interference may be that anti-SARS-

431

CoV-2 antibodies present in the serum may directly cross react to viral antigens and/or virus

432

also found in the serum. Subsequently, the association between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

433

and viral antigens in the serum will inhibit the cross reaction of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

434

with the immobilized SARS-CoV-2 antigen immobilized on ELISA microplates. We also

435

suggest that when antigen/viral load decreases, this interference/competitive effect is

436

alleviated, permitting serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to cross react to immobilized

437

antigen on the ELISA plate and hence being detected. Competitive ELISA is an established

438

practice in immunoassays where the affinity between an antigen and antibody is tested. We

439

propose that this effect may also occur during serological diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2,

440

where antigenemia/viremia observed in COVID-19 will directly interfere with the

441

immunoassay. Presumably, this may also extend to other infectious viral diseases where

442

antigenemia/viremia has been observed.
