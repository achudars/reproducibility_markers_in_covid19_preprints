Abstract
India has seen a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths in early part of 2021, despite having
controlled the epidemic during 2020. Building on a two-strain, semi-mechanistic model that
synthesizes mortality and genomic data, we find evidence that altered epidemiological properties
of B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant play an important role in this resurgence in India. Under all scenarios
of immune evasion, we find an increased transmissibility advantage for B.1617.2 against all
previously circulating strains. Using an extended SIR model accounting for reinfections and
wanning immunity, we produce evidence in support of how early public interventions in March
2021 would have helped to control transmission in the country. We argue that enhanced genomic
surveillance along with constant assessment of risk associated with increased transmission is
critical for pandemic responsiveness.

MAIN TEXT
INTRODUCTION
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in India (where 18% of the world’s population lives (1)) was
reported on January 30, 2020. India was proactive in implementing a suite of effective
and timely public health interventions in the first wave of its epidemic. On March 3, 2020,
with few positively confirmed COVID-19 cases and no reported deaths, India began
border controls through travel bans and visa cancellations (2). Within two weeks of the
World Health Organization (WHO) officiating COVID-19 as a pandemic (3), India made
the historic and highly debated decision to implement a 21-day national lockdown starting
March 25, 2020, with only 536 reported cases and 11 COVID-19 attributable deaths (4).
The lockdown was later extended to four distinct phases that lasted until May 31, 2020
(5–7). During this lockdown, India scaled up testing (8) and treatment facilities (9) within
the constraints of a low-resource setting. Public acceptance of masks, avoidance of social
gatherings, and adoption of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) was
impressive during the initial phase (10). A gradual relaxation of nationwide restrictions
started in monthly phases from June 1, 2020 (11). While countries such as Italy, China,
and South Korea observed a rapid and sustained decline in case counts within a 3- to 4week period of initiating lockdowns and/or other strict NPIs in 2020, India’s daily case
counts continued to increase during and after lockdown, albeit with a substantially
reduced doubling time (12). India’s daily new case counts peaked on September 16,
2020, with 97,860 cases and 1,281 daily new deaths reported. During this time, India also
managed to reduce overall COVID-19 case fatality rates from what was predicted (13),
particularly given its large vulnerable population size and fragile healthcare system (4).

Since the September peak, the incidence curve declined steadily to less than 10,000 daily
new cases in February of 2021 (14). National serosurveys and epidemiological model
estimates indicated a substantial infection under-ascertainment rate, suggesting only
about 6% of infections in India were reported by the end of 2020 (15–18). There were
discussions about urban metros in India approaching herd immunity thresholds with many
of them reporting more than 50% seropositivity (17, 19, 20). The third national serosurvey
in January 2021 indicated 21.5% of adults in India had evidence of a past COVID-19
infection (21). As the country further relaxed restrictions, COVID-appropriate behaviors
diminished with time (10), crowded public transportation system restarted, large indoor
and outdoor gatherings were taking place without meaningful adherence to proper face
coverings. Social and religious events, weddings, political rallies, mass protests - all
cultural facets that define the tapestry of life in India were in full force. The year 2021
started on an optimistic note with multiple vaccine trials going on in India and globally (10)
with promising efficacy and safety results. India formalized operational guidelines for its
national vaccine distribution with emergency-use approval for two vaccines (22), including
prioritizing beneficiaries (23). Vaccination began on January 16 with an initial focus on
healthcare workers. The vaccine roll-out in India has been sluggish, and initially this was
in part due to an underappreciation of the threat that SARS-CoV-2 still posed. Only 8.7
million doses were administered in the first one month, and 0.65% of the population
received at least one dose on February 15. By April 1, only 5.2% of the population had
received at least one dose in India with less than 2% of the population fully vaccinated.
After a steady decline for about four months, an uptick in cases was noted in three Indian
states in February 2021 (Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh) with the national

effective reproduction number crossing the threshold of one on February 14 (24). No strict
control measures were reintroduced in the two months following the initial indications of
a resurgence in transmission. Indeed, the first comprehensive lockdown only started on
April 14 in Maharashtra (25), when India was already witnessing a staggering growth in
infections. A massive humanitarian crisis unfolded that was termed a “national
catastrophe”, and calls were made for an international alliance and collaboration (26).
Healthcare infrastructure collapsed under surges in hospitalizations. The extent of this
collapse was such that various parts of India suffered from acute shortages of oxygen,
steroidal treatment medicine (27) and testing kits. Crematoriums and burial grounds were
overflowing (28, 29). Multiple preprints and investigative reports suggest that the actual
death toll far exceeds official numbers (30, 31). In addition to lack of timely and stringent
preventive measures guided by public health, emerging variants became a large part of
the conversation around India’s second wave (32, 33).
In many other parts of the world, winter of 2020 brought resurgent transmission, with new
SARS-CoV-2 variants being identified in the UK (Alpha/B.1.1.7), Brazil (Gamma/P.1) and
in South Africa (Beta/B.1.351) (34), concurrent with a globally changing pandemic
trajectory (35). Many of these new variants were observed to have epidemiologically
distinct changes in transmissibility as well as antigenic escape. In December 2020, the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) in India launched a multi-laboratory
genomic surveillance initiative formally referred to as the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome
Sequencing Consortia (INSACOG) (36) to track the virus’s evolution and identify new
Variants of Concern (VOC). The year 2020 was a period of comparative evolutionary
stasis for SARS-CoV-2 with infections attributed to the previously circulated lineages (37).

The identification and global spread of other VOCs were mirrored by the identification of
B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 in India (36). The B.1.617(.1/2/3) lineage was first detected in
December 2020 in India and rapidly became a dominant lineage, particularly in
Maharashtra (38). Between January and February 2021, the B.1.617 lineage, including
Delta (B.1.617.2) and Kappa (B.1.617.1), was detected in about 60% of the 361
sequenced cases sampled in Maharashtra (39), and the B.1.617.2 sub-lineage was
marked as a VOC in early-May by WHO (40). Considerable regional heterogeneity exists
with respect to the dominant lineage in India. For instance, the B.1.36 lineage accounted
for 43.7% of cases (November 22, 2020, to January 22, 2021) in Bengaluru, Karnataka
(41). Over 80% of the 401 cases sampled in Punjab were attributed to the B.1.1.7 lineage
(42). Another newly detected lineage, B.1.618, was reported to be increasingly circulating
in the eastern state of West Bengal (43).
In this paper, we present an epidemiological analysis of the second wave of COVID-19
transmission in India. First, we compare the second wave to the first wave, nationally and
across states and union territories, in terms of multiple public health metrics. Using a
dynamic epidemiological model that integrates both genomic and COVID-19 mortality
data, we then investigate the extent to which the emergence and altered epidemiological
properties of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (i.e., B.1.617.2 sub-lineage) might have
driven the surge in the observed case and death counts in the second wave in India.
Finally, we estimate the number of deaths that could have been averted through an early
nationwide intervention (like a lockdown) at various time points in March and April 2021
during the onset of the second wave. We conclude with some recommendations moving
forward.

The second wave dwarfs the first wave in India
Comparison at a national level: We define the second wave as starting on February 14,
2021, the day the effective reproduction number, R t, exceeded one (i.e., Rt > 1), indicating
a growth in case counts after 4 months of steady decline. For comparative purposes, we
consider June 13, 2020, as the starting point of the first wave (Wave 1), the first time the
daily case counts were comparable to the daily case counts observed on February 14,
2021, the start of the second wave (Wave 2). Our analysis period ends on May 31, 2021,
for the descriptive analysis. As shown in Table 1, Wave 2 is more severe than Wave 1 in
nearly every metric of growth: higher maximum R t, nearly 4 times higher maximum daily
cases and deaths, and maximum daily test-positive rate (TPR) of 25% in Wave 2 versus
16% in Wave 1. There is growing consensus among epidemiologists that the second
wave in India has had a greater severity than the first wave (44, 45). While there have
been more cases and deaths in Wave 2, there is a lower reported case-fatality rate
compared to Wave 1 (1.0% vs 1.4%). This could partly be explained by reports that
younger age groups were infected more in Wave 2 where the clinical infection fatality rate
is lower, but this assertion is yet to be verified (46). It is important to note that we do not
have full follow-up data on Wave 2 and more deaths continue to be reported in June
including some states like Bihar revising previously reported death numbers (47). There
exists a systemic delay in updating death records and underreporting of case and death
counts appear to be a challenge with this data (31, 48).
State-level comparisons: Multiple articles have now shown that there is substantial
heterogeneity across Indian states and union territories, and the national data often
masks this state-level variation (12). For this comparison, due to the differences in the

lengths of our analysis periods for the waves (246 versus 107 days), we calculate
standardized case and death counts by states across waves, as described in
Supplementary Material Section 1. For example, in Wave 1, Delhi reported 599,972
cases in 246 days, yielding a standardized daily case rate of 2438.9, whereas in Wave 2,
789,444 cases were reported in a timespan of 107 days, yielding a daily case rate of
7377.9. Consequently, the ratio of daily case rates for Wave 2 versus Wave 1 in Delhi is
3.0. Only one union territory, namely the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, reports a lessthan-unity ratio of 0.9, indicating a less severe Wave 2 when compared to Wave 1. All
other states and union territories return ratios that are greater than unity, suggesting a
more severe Wave 2. Across all states and union territories, the median ratio of daily case
rate for Wave 2 versus Wave 1 is 3.8. The states with the four highest case intensity ratios
are (in decreasing order): Uttarakhand (5.6), Himachal Pradesh (5.3), Punjab (5.2) and
Gujarat (5.2). These findings are reflected in Figure 1A.
Following a similar approach for death counts, Delhi reported 9,675 deaths in Wave 1
over 246 days, yielding a standardized death intensity of 39.3. In Wave 2, there were
13,348 deaths reported over 107 days in Delhi, yielding a standardized death rate of
124.8. Consequently, the ratio of daily death rates for Wave 2 versus Wave 1 in Delhi is
3.2. Two states report ratios that are less than unity (Tripura 0.7 and Odisha 0.99),
indicating a less severe Wave 2 when compared to Wave 1, while all other states and
union territories return ratios that are greater than unity. Across all other states and union
territories, the median death rate ratio for Wave 2 versus Wave 1 is 3.2. The states with
the five highest death count intensity ratios are (in decreasing order): Jharkhand (8.4),

State-level comparison of movement of the virus and peaks across Waves 1 and 2:
The national peak occurred on September 16, 2020, with 97,860 daily cases during Wave
1 and on May 6, 2021, with 414,280 daily cases during Wave 2. However, we see
significant variation in the timing of the peaks across states in both waves. For example,
Wave 1 peaks in 2020 occurred as early as July 27 for Tamil Nadu and as late as
November 29 for Himachal Pradesh. Similarly, Wave 2 peaks ranged from April 17, 2021
(Ladakh) through May 30, 2021 (Mizoram). Only 9 of the 36 states and union territories
experienced a higher proportion of total cases in Wave 1 than in Wave 2 until May 31.
Deaths are a lagged metric of infections, and we see the national peak of daily new deaths
in Wave 2 was attained on May 18 with 4,529 new deaths reported, nearly 4 times the
peak in Wave 1 (1,281 deaths). The peaks for daily number of deaths across states took
place from the end of April to the end of May in 2021 for Wave 2 while they were dispersed
from July to November of 2020 for Wave 1. Even with a limited follow-up time, twentyeight states had already seen more deaths in Wave 2 than Wave 1. The timeline for the
sequence of peaks across Indian states is presented in Supplementary Table S1a and
S1b.
New virus variants explain part of the Wave 2 surge
As shown in Figure 1 and Table S1 there is considerable spatial heterogeneity in infection
burden and fatalities across states and union territories in India across the waves. The
period just before and around the second wave has seen the introduction of multiple
VOCs, and variants under investigation in India (49, 50). This period is marked by a rapid
increase in the infection share of B.1.617.2 which has, as of late April 2021 (51), become

the dominant strain (>99% of all sequenced genomes). A detailed literature review of the
variant landscape in India is presented in Table S2.
We explore epidemiological factors underlying the resurgence of transmission observed
across India, with a specific focus on the SARS-CoV-2 VOC B.1.617.2 (Delta variant
under the WHO nomenclature (34, 52)) as a driver of the second wave. Recent in vitro
work shows B.1.617.2 is associated with significantly reduced antibody neutralization
(with reductions similar to those observed for the Beta VOC B.1.351) (53), whilst analysis
of secondary attack rates in UK households have suggested a transmission advantage
of B.1.617.2 over the Alpha VOC B.1.1.7 (54). We restrict our analyses to the state of
Maharashtra which has had the largest COVID-19 burden to date in India and where
detailed epidemiological and genomic data required to assess the contribution of
B.1.617.2 to resurgence is available. Table S3 and Figure S1 provide a temporal
distribution of this variant in Maharashtra, where the proportion of B.1.617.2 samples rose
from 1.5% in February 2021 to 87% in May 2021.
We adapt a previous two-strain epidemiological model developed by Faria et al. (55) to
explore the extent and nature of alterations to B.1.617.2’s characteristics (such as
transmissibility, severity and ability to evade immunity elicited by prior natural infection)
that are required to explain the extensive resurgence of transmission observed during the
second wave. Within this framework (55), we explicitly include the possibility for other
competing hypotheses to explain this resurgence, such as increased transmissibility or
immune evasion capabilities for the new variant B.1.617.2, as well as waning of prior
immunity from infections occurring during the first wave. The framework essentially fuses
mortality data with genomic distribution data from GISAID. The mortality data is used in

a renewal framework (56, 57) by linking it to the infections. The genomic data is used to
estimate the fraction of infections for individual strains, i.e., B.1617.2 and non-B.1617.2.
In the absence of up-to-date and representative state-wide serological surveys enabling
accurate ascertainment of the infection fatality ratio (IFR) across Maharashtra and the
uncertainty surrounding the extent to which COVID-19 deaths might be missed due to
testing constraints, we run a suite of different scenarios, exploring the extent and nature
of the inferred changes to B.1.617.2’s epidemiological properties. We assume the
introduction date for B.1617.2 variant as 1st Dec 2020, as the first sequence for B.1.617.2
in GISAID for Maharashtra is dated 10th Dec 2020 (50). The results presented in the main
text are for an assumed IFR of 0.25% (31) and an under-reporting factor of 50%
(suggesting 1 in 2 deaths are missed due to testing and other logistical constraints which
is a very conservative estimate based on the literature (31)); results from a sensitivity
analysis comprising eleven other scenarios are summarized in Table S4.
Figure 2 (left column) shows the fit for the model where under-reporting is 50% along
with IFR 0.25% and protection immunity of 100%. The fraction of deaths attributed by the
model to the B.1617.2 variant from April 1-May 15 is 55% [10%-90%] (95% Bayesian
Credible Interval [CI]). However, this number varies from being 15% [5%-45%] on 1st April
to 83% [62%-96%] on 15th May 2021. Furthermore, results shown in Figure 2 (right
column) suggest the epidemiological characteristics of B.1.617.2 are different from those
of previously circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages (see Table S2 for a list) - across the three
plausible values of cross-infection (100% - no immunity escape; 75% - moderate
possibility of reinfection; 50% - higher possibility of reinfection), our results consistently
support the hypothesis of B.1.617.2 as being more transmissible than all previously

circulating lineages. As seen in Figure 2, under scenarios of highest cross-immunity
(100%, meaning previous infection with non-B.1.617.2 lineages provides robust
protection to B.1.617.2 infection except in those individuals where immunity has waned),
levels of population immunity to B.1.617.2 are higher and so a greater transmissibility
increase, 83% [77%-90%], is required to generate the observed second wave.
Conversely, when the degree of cross-immunity is lowest (50%), more individuals are
available for infection with B.1.617.2 (including a fraction of those previously infected with
non-B.1.617.2 lineages), and so a smaller increase in transmissibility, 49% [44%-55%] is
required to explain the observed second wave. Nonetheless, higher transmissibility is
indicated across all scenarios.
However, these results remain highly uncertain, particularly given the absence of reliable
serological surveys to infer cumulative population infections to date and the IFR. Whilst
we cannot quantify the exact extent and nature of the changes, our results highlight that
immunity waning or relaxation of NPIs alone cannot explain the large second wave in
Maharashtra. Instead, the results suggest that this was at least partially driven by the
emergence of a variant with altered epidemiological properties. We would like to point
out that our two-strain model doesn’t account for NPIs explicitly but observed changes to
the reproduction number as a consequence of the NPIs are modelled as a 7-day random
walk (55). We note that, our estimates of altered epidemiological properties for B.1.617.2
are qualitatively robust under various conservative scenarios of lower IFR and no underreporting, though the numerical values change. For example, in a scenario with a low IFR
of 0.15% (58), no under-reporting and 100% protection, the estimates of transmissibility
increase are 82% [76-88%], which is aligned with the results in the corresponding result

The resurgent Wave 2 could have been prevented through early public health
interventions
Could timely nationwide NPIs have mitigated the speed of Wave 2 in India? A summary
of COVID-19-related public health interventions that were implemented in India from
March 3, 2020, through May 31, 2021, is provided in Table S5. Using evidence from
previously observed lockdown effects in India (nationwide, beginning March 25, 2020)
and in Maharashtra (beginning April 14, 2021), we can assess what would have

happened had an intervention with a similar effect taking place across India at various
timepoints in March and April of 2021. Because of the observed strength of the 2020
national lockdown, we use it as a “strong lockdown effect” intervention schedule, while
the 2021 Maharashtra lockdown represents a “moderate lockdown effect” intervention
schedule. A detailed description of the predictive model used and how the modifying
intervention effect schedules were elicited from real data based on rates of growth/decline
in case counts over time are described in Supplementary Material Section 3.
Intervention effect on cases: As one would expect, implementing a lockdown during an
optimal time window has short- and long-term benefits with respect to the degree of
reduction in reported case counts. This result is consistent regardless of whether a strong
lockdown effect (Figure 3a) or a moderate lockdown effect (Figure 3b) is used. Indeed,
had a lockdown been instituted in mid- to late-March of 2021, the case counts would have
almost immediately started to decline, with the daily case count peaking around 20
thousand and 49 thousand, respectively (instead of the observed 414,280). To put this in
perspective, with a moderate lockdown starting on March 15, approximately 2.6 million
cases (95% CI: [0.3, 2.9]) (bolded in Table 2) could have been avoided through April 15,
representing a 91.6% (95% CI: [10.1%, 100.0%]) reduction in total case counts compared
to observed numbers. We demonstrate that these reductions in the number of infected
cases would continue to grow through May 15, resulting in the prevention of 12.9 million
infections (95% CI: [9.5, 13.3]), a 97.0% reduction (95% CI: [71.7%, 100.0%]); (bolded
in Table 2). Interestingly, a lockdown with strong effect beginning March 15 would also
result in essentially the same number of infections being prevented (12.9 million with
moderate effect vs 13.0 million with strong effect) by May 15 (98.2% reduction in cases,

95% CI: [73.7%, 100.0%]). This suggests that the timing of the intervention matters, and
March 15-30 would have been the optimal time window for intervening.

for day-to-day variations in Rt. Three lockdown start dates are depicted: March 15 (red), March 30 (green), and April 15 (light blue).
Peak daily case counts under lockdown scenarios are shown.

For lockdowns beginning in mid-April, the benefits are not as pronounced. Our findings
indicate that a peak would have occurred shortly after a lockdown with a strong effect with
around 150,000 cases at the peak. However, under a lockdown with moderate effect, a

near term peak is not obvious and the peak is attained at around 209,000 daily new cases
(Figure 3A and 3B); it would have induced a reduction (approximately 51.9% or 5.4
million cases) in total case counts from April 15 to May 15, 2021, but the 95% CI [-0.5,
9.9] includes the zero value so the decrease is not statistically significant. An end-of-April
national lockdown would have been too late for any marked benefit because the second
wave outbreak had already run its course (largely aided by state-level lockdowns in
Maharashtra and Delhi (59)), as is evident by the slowing growth and eventual decline of
observed daily cases after May 6 (14).
Intervention effect on deaths: To estimate the number of preventable deaths we
multiply the predicted cases under each intervention effect with daily CFR estimates
obtained under three different scenarios. Details are presented in Supplementary
Section 3. Three daily CFR schedules, based on observed data from Kerala, India, and
Maharashtra on exactly the same dates, are applied to daily predicted case counts. For
simplicity, we refer to these as low, moderate, and high CFR schedules, respectively. A
similar pattern as the case counts can be seen with respect to death counts. Clear
benefits from lockdowns beginning in mid- and late-March are present under all CFR
scenarios through mid-May (Figure 4). Under the moderate intervention effect, our
estimates show roughly 97 to 109 thousand deaths could have been avoided by May 15,
2021 (Table 3), a reduction of 89.6-98.5% from the observed 112 thousand deaths
observed from March 15- May 15, under all CFR schedules. Regardless of strictness and
timing of the lockdown (Figure 4C), if there is sufficient healthcare capacity (i.e., low CFR
scenario), we see that a lockdown would have remarkable benefits in terms of reducing
death counts. For example, we see that a March 15 lockdown would have resulted in a

98.5% [95% CI: 85.2%, 100.0%] (109.7 thousand [95% CI: 94.9, 111.4] deaths averted)
reduction by May 15 (Table 3). Even with a very late lockdown on April 15, in the low CFR
situation 91.6% [95% CI: 81.6%, 99.4%] of the deaths could have been averted by May
15 while this proportion is 55.1%% [95% CI: 0.9%, 95.7%] for the moderate CFR and
37.9% [95% CI: -37.9%, 94.5%] for the high CFR scenario.
Projected deaths under the three CFR schedules under a lockdown with strong effect are
presented in Figure S3. This shows slightly stronger effects suggesting a mid-late March
lockdown could have prevented 94-99% of deaths by May 15. The analyses conducted
using a model incorporating waning immunity are presented in Supplementary Section
S3.1. Because the results are nearly indistinguishable from the results using a model
without waning immunity (e.g., under strong intervention scenario, it projects 102-111
thousand deaths could be averted by a mid-to-late March lockdown regardless of
intervention compared to 97-110 thousand deaths in the model without waning immunity),
we present the results without waning immunity in the main text as it is a simpler model.
To summarize, had action taken place at any time in March, it is plausible that more than
90% of observed cases and deaths between March 1-May 15 could potentially be avoided
under both strong and moderate intervention scenarios.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
By virtually every metric, Wave 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in India has been more
acute and devastating than Wave 1. Owing to the development of COVID-19 vaccines,
treatments and care, and the fact that variants of the virus have not yet demonstrated
marked increases in lethality, the observed case fatality rate appears to be lower in Wave
2 than in Wave 1 (31). However, with daily infections growing exponentially, even with a
small infection fatality rate, a large number of deaths are bound to occur, partly due to the
natural infection related mortality but also due to the collapse of the healthcare system.
We see a tragic example of this in India’s Wave 2. Despite the early and decisive actions
taken in Wave 1, strong interventions were not enforced in Wave 2. Our analysis shows
that a large fraction of cases and deaths could potentially be averted with early
comprehensive nationwide interventions, with realistic data-driven effect sizes that are
derived from lockdowns that took place in India.
Study Limitations: We acknowledge there are certain overarching limitations in our work.
First, under-reporting of cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 is not aptly accounted
for across these results. At the time of this report, officials have reported intermittent
excess death calculations for selected cities (60–62) and for even fewer states in India,
and hence, adjusting for under-reporting remains a challenge (62). All reports point to a
large degree of underreporting, particularly in rural India (48). Similar considerations apply
for infections. While we characterize effects of NPI on reported cases this only captures

11

a small fraction of infections. The more recent serosurveys that are emerging indicate
55% seropositivity in age-groups 0-17 and 63% in adults in urban areas (63). Second, the
lack of disaggregation of cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the data available
at the time of this study prohibits any investigation into differences within age-sex strata
and identify vulnerable, underserved subgroups. This limits our ability to interpret some
of the observations. For example, the apparent overall lower infection fatality rate in Wave
2 can be largely due to younger people getting infected. An age-specific fatality
comparison is necessary but could not be performed. Third, our models do not
incorporate vaccine roll-out. For further context, during the Wave 2 analysis period, about
3% of India was fully vaccinated and 10% received at least one dose (based on vaccine
data available from covid19india.org (14) through May 15, 2021). Since age and
occupation was at large the determining factor in vaccine eligibility, accounting for vaccine
distribution during this period also requires age-stratified data which is not currently
available in India. Fourth, our assessment period for the effect of intervention contains
the period April 15-May 15 where many states in fact instituted partial lockdowns. Thus,
the comparison with the observed data for this period is not with a no-intervention
scenario but with the actual ground reality with a mix of mitigation strategies being
compared to the idealized hypothetical lockdown effect. The comparison up to April 15 is
clearer to interpret.

Finally, we had to restrict our exploration of the epidemiologic

properties of B.1.617.2 to the state of Maharashtra as the nationwide temporal distribution
of this variant that is available in the GISAID database does not have adequate coverage
of all Indian states. Amongst other states with genomic data, we chose Maharashtra not
just because it contributes the largest share to India’s COVID case and death burden, but

also because it instituted the earliest statewide lockdown (April 14, 2021). If we see a high
transmissibility despite a statewide NPI, it provides stronger evidence in support of the
hypothesis. However, we do acknowledge as shown in Supplementary Figure S8 a,b,
growth of SARS-Cov-2 variants in India has very large spatiotemporal heterogeneity
between March 1-May 15, 2021 (64, 65). A detailed future analysis is required to really
capture this heterogeneity once reliable genomic, mortality and seroprevalence data is
available for the second wave.

Relatedly, our inferences about the extent and nature of changes to B.1.617.2’s
epidemiological properties remain highly uncertain. Though we mitigate these issues
somewhat by running a suite of sensitivity analyses that consistently support altered
epidemiological properties as being different to previously circulating lineages (even if
uncertainty remains about the degree to which they have changed), our results
underscore the urgent need for more detailed collection of genomic and epidemiological
data (including mortality, estimates of underreporting and the carrying out of further
serological surveys). An important assumption made in our analyses is that the genomic
data (taken from GISAID) represent a random sample that accurately reflects the nature
of transmission occurring in Maharashtra over the study period. Several potential
sampling biases exist (including preferential sampling of symptomatic or severely ill
individuals, preferential sequencing of samples based on PCR diagnostic results etc.),
again highlighting the need for greater investment in routine genomic sequencing during
viral epidemics. More broadly, our model makes the important simplifying assumption of
homogeneous mixing between populations and various age groups. Hence, our model

does not capture the more nuanced heterogeneities in spread likely to have occurred both
across the state (e.g., between cities) and within-cities (such as between slum and nonslum dwelling populations). In spite of the limitations, such expanded sensitivity analyses
can be helpful to understand the altered epidemiological characteristics of emerging sublineages like the “delta plus” (B.1.617.2.1) or PANGO lineage designation AY.1 variant
with the K417N mutation. Finally, we recognize that retrospective analysis of the role of
NPI is of limited use, many forecasting models alerted of this surge in February and March
when such NPIs could actually save lives. However, we hope the present analysis helps
to design preventions for future surges by quantifying the value of timely interventions.
Conclusion:.Rapid expansion of vaccination efforts as an effective, evidence-based
intervention to reduce COVID-19 transmission and death is the way moving forward for
India. Amidst emerging variants of concern, several small studies collectively suggest that
antibodies are slightly less protective against B.1.617 relative to lineages that were
present in the beginning of the pandemic. In Delhi, examination of serum from 30 reinfected healthcare workers, all fully vaccinated, revealed a resounding presence of
B.1.617, thereby building evidence of this variant’s ability to evade antibodies (66).
Likewise, German investigators found that the B.1.617 variant confers a reduction in
antibody neutralization efficiency (50% among convalescent patients and 67% among
those with both doses of the Pfizer vaccine) compared to common variants at the outset
of the pandemic (67). While a comprehensive countrywide and region-specific
investigation in India into the variant landscape, level of transmissibility, and immune
evasion is needed, early evidence suggests attenuated yet effective levels of crossimmunity – vaccines work. The projected timeline to get the adult population of India

vaccinated is by the end of this year (68). However, India is a very young population and
roughly 40% of the population is in the age group of 0-18 years (69), for whom there are
no vaccines available yet. Until there is a sufficient supply of vaccines to inoculate most
of the Indian population, non-pharmaceutical public health interventions will be key for
India as the country designs its current lockdown exit strategy. Such measures are crucial
for curbing deaths, infections, and subsequent viral mutation; out analysis demonstrates
that the earlier an intervention takes place, the better – timing matters.
Our findings echo the need for enhanced surveillance efforts, continued attention to the
emergence of variants and examination of subsequent consequences for transmissibility,
cross-immunity, and vaccine effectiveness. The scenarios we ran for the models with
sequencing data show us that the resurgence of the second wave cannot be fully
explained by the waning immunity or even the increased transmissibility. The extent of
reinfections or immune evasion can only be substantiated after clinical studies of the
variants, and we also need better availability of data so that we can move from modelling
scenarios to more data-based inferences to provide better understanding of the epidemic
landscape in India. We urge further ramping up of the sequencing effort in India to ensure
sequencing-based epidemiological analyses are equipped with a sufficiently large,
representative sample and to keep pace with, as well as predict, the various evolutionary
paths of the virus. Strengthening the surveillance for COVID19 in every district is
important for identifying clusters requiring further investigation. Among existent innovative
strategies, wastewater analysis has also been shown to be a promising method for crossvalidation of clinical data, for evaluating regional genomic sequencing efforts, and for in
turn identifying novel SARS-CoV-2 strains otherwise undetected (70). Prioritizing

sequencing of reinfections, as well as vaccine breakthrough infections, is necessary to
understand vaccine effectiveness and development needs against emerging Variants of
Concern. We hope that the lessons from Wave 2 lead to a bolstering of public health
infrastructure, timely and comprehensive collection, and release of data as well as compel
policymakers to act more proactively, thereby preparing India to respond to future waves
and crises.

Notes: For lockdown schedules, each cell reports (1) the total number of observed cases since the start of lockdown in the first row, (2) total number of predicted cases since the start of lockdown in the second row (with 95% CI), (3) the number of cases
averted (relative to observed) since the start of lockdown in the third row (with 95% CI), and (4) the relative reduction in cases (as a percent) under lockdown in the fourth row (with 95% CI). Cells that are highlighted in red represent a statistically significant
reduction in the number of cases under lockdown at the 95% credible interval level. Cells that are bolded are emphasized in the main text. Numbers are reported in millions.
