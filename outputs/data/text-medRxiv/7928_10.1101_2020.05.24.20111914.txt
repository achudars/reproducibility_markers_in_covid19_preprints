Key Points

Question: What are the cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 and do they provide insight into the
pathophysiology or prognosis?

Findings: In this international registry-based case series of 716 patients representing 31 countries, the most
common dermatologic morphologies encountered in the 171 COVID-19 confirmed case included morbilliform,
pernio-like, urticarial, macular erythema, vesicular, papulosquamous, and retiform purpura. Retiform purpura was
seen exclusively in critically ill, hospitalized patients.

Meaning: COVID-19 is associated with a spectrum of skin findings in affected patients. These cutaneous
manifestations may vary depending on the severity of COVID-19.

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus1

2 (SARS-CoV-2) has associated cutaneous manifestations. Case series have thus far documented lesions that
are pernio-like,2-6 erythematous macules or papules,5-7 urticarial,7,8 morbilliform,8 varicelliform,5-9 and
10

papulosquamous. Petechial eruptions,

8,11

livedo reticularis-like rashes,

5,8

5

purpuric lesions, and acro-ischemic

lesions12 and retiform purpura13 have been reported less frequently. The timing of these varied eruptions in the
disease course remains unclear, as do any potential associations between morphological subtypes with different
COVID-19-associated syndromes, disease courses, and/or outcomes.
Methods: In collaboration with the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and International League of
Dermatologic Societies (ILDS), we established an international registry to collect cases of COVID-19 with
cutaneous associations (www.aad.org/covidregistry); the registry is open to medical professionals only. No
protected health information was collected, and all data was de-identified. The registry collected information on
COVID-19 diagnosis type (suspected vs laboratory-confirmed), patient demographics, comorbidities, details
regarding the patientsâ€™ new onset dermatologic condition, timing of dermatologic condition onset, information from
skin biopsy reports when available, COVID-19 symptoms, and outcomes, including hospitalization, oxygen
requirements, ventilator requirements, and deaths. All suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, with
new onset dermatologic findings, were eligible for inclusion in initial analysis. A sub-group analysis was performed
restricted to lab-confirmed cases.
Results: The registry collected 716 cases of new-onset dermatologic symptoms in patients with suspected or
confirmed COVID-19 from April 8 to May 17, 2020. Cases came from 31 countries with most (89%) from the
United States. Dermatologists entered most of the cases (54%). Median patient age was 30 years (IQR 19-49).
Of the 171 patients in the registry with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, the most common cutaneous
morphologies, in order of frequency, were morbilliform, pernio-like, urticarial, macular erythema, vesicular,
papulosquamous, and retiform purpura. In general, lesions tended to occur after (64%) or concurrently (15%) with
other COVID-19 symptoms. Retiform purpura appeared in patients with the most severe disease course,
presenting exclusively in very ill, hospitalized patients. Skin biopsies were reviewed for 15 patients.
Conclusions and Relevance: This study highlights the array of cutaneous manifestations associated with
COVID-19 diagnoses. Many morphologies were non-specific, while others may allow insight into potential
immune or inflammatory pathways in COVID-19 pathophysiology. These cutaneous manifestations may vary
depending on the severity of COVID-19, with retiform purpura exclusively reported in hospitalized patients.
