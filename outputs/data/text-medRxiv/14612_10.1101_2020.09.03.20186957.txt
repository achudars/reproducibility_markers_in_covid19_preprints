Abstract Amid growing debate between scientists and policymakers on the tradeoff between public safety and reviving economy during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the government of Bangladesh decided to relax the countrywide lockdown restrictions from the beginning of June 2020. Instead, the Ministry of Public Affairs
officials have declared some parts of the capital city and a few other districts as
red zones or high-risk areas based on the number of people infected in the late
June 2020. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 infection rate had been increasing in almost
every other part of the country. Ironically, rather than ensuring rapid tests and
isolation of COVID-19 patients, from the beginning of July 2020, the Directorate
General of Health Services restrained the maximum number of tests per laboratory. Thus, the health experts have raised the question of whether the government
is heading toward achieving herd immunity instead of containing the COVID-19
pandemic. In this article, the dynamics of the pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 in
Bangladesh are analyzed with the SIRD model. We demonstrate that the herd
immunity threshold can be reduced to 31% than that of 60% by considering age
group cluster analysis resulting in a total of 53.0 million susceptible populations.
With the data of Covid-19 cases till July 22, 2020, the time-varying reproduction
numbers are used to explain the nature of the pandemic. Based on the estimations

1 Introduction
In late December 2019, a novel strain of Coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, a city in central China and thought to spread an outbreak of viral
pneumonia [1, 2]. This novel Coronavirus is assumed to have a zoonotic origin,
as all the very first pneumonia cases with unknown etiologies were linked with
Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale market [3]. Since the novel pathogen rapidly
transmitted across the globe, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a public health emergency of international
concern on January 30, 2020 [4]. It has been reported by WHO that this contagious disease control heavily relies on early detection, isolation of symptomatic
cases, prompt treatment, and tracing the contacts history [5]. However, the lack
of antiviral vaccines and the difficulties in the identification of the asymptomatic
carriers made it very challenging to contain the pandemic [6].
To examine the course of the pandemic and to suggest preventive strategies,
mathematical models can play a crucial role in describing transmission dynamics as
well as for forecasting quantitative assessment. The classic mean-field SusceptibleInfected-Recovery-Death (SIRD) model by Kermack and McKendrick is one of
the most commonly used models that illustrates the quantitative pictures of a
pandemic through four mutually exclusive infection phases, namely susceptible,
infected, recovered and death [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Although several other mathematical models, including discrete-time SIR model [12], SEIR (susceptible, exposed,
infected, recovered) model [13], control-oriented SIR model [14] and SIDARTHE
(susceptible, infected, diagnosed, ailing, recognized, threatened, healed, extinct)
models have been utilized so far to portray the progressive spread of the COVID19 pandemic [15], we implemented SIRD model to explore the temporal progression
of COVID-19 transmission in Bangladesh.
On March 26, 2020, a nation-wide 10-day lockdown was imposed by the Bangladesh
government to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 in the wake of four deaths and
at least 39 Corona active cases [16]. While there are many pivotal lessons to be
learned from the US, Italy, Spain, China and other countries concerning their
COVID-19 responses, it has been an uphill battle to import all their policies, such
as prolonged lockdown, massive Coronavirus testing, isolation of positive cases and
access to proper healthcare in Bangladesh due to its socio-economic structure. Despite nationwide lockdown, Bangladesh had seen a rise in the COVID-19 positive
cases in the following few months.
On May 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a total of 47,153 positive cases, with a total
death toll of 650. Despite the rise in the transmission rate, the government of
Bangladesh decided to relax the lockdown restrictions to restore the economy in
the country. As a preparation to face the pandemic, the Directorate General of
Health Services in Bangladesh (DGHS) had prepared a total of 7,034 hospital beds
that were outnumbered by the current need of the densely populated country [17].

Fig. 1 Bangladesh has the lowest number of tests per million people in the world. Still, a
significant reduction in the RT-PCR based lab tests has been observed from July 1, 2020, in
Bangladesh (blue triangle). This results in an increase in the test positivity rate approaching
to 25% (red dot) within the following two weeks. WHO recommends that the test positivity
rate should be less than 5% [18].

The total COVID-19 positive patients in Bangladesh has been reported to be a
total of 213,254, with a total case fatality of 2,751 persons throughout the country
on July 22, 2020. Regardless of lifting the lockdown, the DGHS restricted the
number of lab tests which is quite contrary to the test and isolation policy. The
result is clearly visible in Figure 1. As the number of lab tests has been decreasing,
the number of daily positive cases started dropping as well. On the other hand,
we observe that the test positivity rate is on the rise. In addition to this, there has
been news in the daily newspapers that people are waiting for COVID-19 tests in
a long line and many of them are returning without the tests due to the limited
number of test kits to handle a large number patients [19]. Moreover, having a
limited number of hospital beds together with unavailability of Oxygen supply,
many patients stopped seeking medical help. As a result, while in the middle of
June, national dailies reported that patients are dying without any medical help
on the road while moving from one hospital to another for an empty bed [20],
recently a lot of COVID-19 patients stopped going to the hospital to seek medical
help resulting in empty beds [17].
Therefore, based on the current situation, one can ask if Bangladesh is moving
toward herd immunity and if so then what could be its consequence on the public
health. It is indispensable to have a careful balance between various key epidemiological factors in order to estimate the spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. This
is the reason why mathematical estimation can play a very important role to understand the future we may expect based on the latest policies implemented in
the country. In the following sections of this article, we present the dynamics of
the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh with the SIRD model and estimate the

Fig. 2 The time-varying reproduction number Rt , has been compared with the average mobility [21], the growth of confirmed cases and the doubling time to analyze the effect of the
implemented lockdown (L1 to L4 ) in Bangladesh. The lockdown situations are described as
L1 , March 26 when the lockdown is implemented for all over the country [22]; L2 , April 26
when ready made garment factories reopened [23]; L3 , May 10 when shopping malls were reopened before Eid-ul-Fitre [24]; and L4 , May 30 when everything but educational institutes
were reopened [25]. The confirmed cases and the number of deaths on those days are also
shown (labeled as C and D).

2 The Study of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh
Bangladesh has implemented various types of control measures to contain the
pandemic, such as total/partial lockdown, declaring an area as a quarantined/red
zone, suspending the long and short distance transportation in the different parts of
the country, including wearing masks and maintaining social distance in the public
transportation. Each of these control measures were imposed on various dates
and were lifted off for various reasons. To describe the effect of the implemented
pandemic control methods in Bangladesh, the time-varying reproduction number,
Rt is used since it provides the real-time estimation of the pandemic dynamics.
In the case of controlling the pandemic of a region, the Rt provides valuable
information about the dynamics and instantaneous effect of the control mechanism
[26]. We analyze the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Bangladesh using Rt with
respect to four of the major events, i.e., starting of lockdown, mass movement,
ease of lockdown (limited shopping mall, public transportation etc.), and lifting of
the lockdown for restarting local economy.
The pandemic control method and the changes in SARS-CoV-2 cases are shown
in Figure 2. Bangladesh implemented very early lockdown on March 26, 2020 to
control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [22], and that was lifted on May 30, 2020 with
44,608 confirmed cases and 610 deaths [25]. In this report, we choose 100 confirmed

cases as the baseline of Rt computation that had climbed to 4.1 and then fell below
1.5 with high confidence on April 24, 2020.
Due to the garment factories reopening on April 26, 2020, a mass population
moved to the capital of Bangladesh (L2 ) [23]. Despite of this movement, the value
of Rt remained around 1.25. During L3 , all the shopping mall, business office,
public transportation were reopened and surprisingly there was not any noticeable
variation in Rt [24]. We further observe that Rt had dropped below 1.0 on May
25 and then it jumped to 1.5 on May 30 (L4 ), the day when Bangladesh reopened
its economics by unlocking everything except the educational institutes [25].
Since the lifting of the lockdown (L4 ), we observe that public mobility is on
the rise, represented as a drop in the negative Google mobility score in the Figure
2. That directly contradicts the drop in the value Rt , drop in the daily growth
rate and increase in the doubling time (Figure 2). In addition to these countering
observations, in the Figure 1, we present that the test positivity rate is on the rise.
Thus, it clearly present that the most successful intervention of test and isolation
for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic has not been carefully maintained by
the DGHS in Bangladesh. This is why, a discussion is surfacing among the public
health professionals as though Bangladesh government is expecting to achieve herd
immunity [27].

3 Adjustment of COVID-19 Dynamics in Herd Immunity
In this article, the dynamic behavior of the class of infected people is described
using three different reproduction numbers, such as the basic (R0 ), effective (Re ),
and time-varying (Rt ) reproduction number. To estimate the number of people to
be infected in case of the herd immunity, we consider the total number of current
population to be 170.1 million by 2020 [28]. According to the SIR model, R0 is
used to describe the transmissibility of a disease in a region if the population is
randomly mixed. It will have only one value with a marginal error for an epidemic. But with the implementation of the various epidemic control methods in
Bangladesh, the ”randomly mixed” condition for virus transmission within the
population has been violated. Currently, a few different R0 estimations have been
reported ranging between 1.4 to 3.0 [29, 30, 31] for the country. But due to the
intervention mechanism, the original method to compute susceptible population
from the R0 cannot be followed. So we rather estimate the susceptible population
for the herd immunity based on the current transimissiblity of COVID-19 within
the individual age group.

Bangladesh has already implemented various types of control measures to contain the pandemic. Each of these control measures was imposed on various dates
and was lifted off for various reasons. These random events made it very challenging to estimate the susceptible population for herd immunity in Bangladesh.
Hence, we consider the initial susceptible population following the age group distribution of the population depending on the confirmed positive cases to make our
final assessment for herd immunity. In the Table 1, we present the age distribution
of the population in Bangladesh (collected from Socioeconomic Data and Application Center, or SEDAC) along with the confirmed positive cases and deaths for
each of those age groups (collected from Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control
and Research, or IEDCR). In Bangladesh, the gender ratio for the confirmed cases
has been reported as M ale : F emale = 71 : 29 by the IEDCR [16]. Using these
distributions of population and the confirmed SARS-COV-2 cases, the susceptible
population for herd immunity is estimated. As 54.6% of the total confirmed positive cases has been reported within the age group of 21-40, we estimate the total
susceptible population with respect to this age group.

3.1 Adjustment of Susceptible Population
We consider the population of Bangladesh is P , distributed in the age group as,
P =

X

Pi =

X

i

M i + Fi

(1)

i

where Pi is the population at i-th age group which is redistributed in male (M )
and female (F ).
Let us assume that q% of the male at age group j will be infected i.e., the
susceptible population at j, Sj = Mj × q%. In our case, we consider the age group
j to be 21 − 40.
From the age distribution of the SARS-CoV-2, we can find the distributed
number of all confirmed cases C as,
C=

X

Ci

(2)

i

where Ci is the confirmed cases at i-th age group, where the ratio of male (CM )
and female (CF ) is m : f . Thus,
Ci = CMi + CFi = CMi +

CMi = 1 +

(3)

Since, the age group j (21-40 in Table 1) is the mostly affected group in
Bangladesh due to their activities and movement for earning livelihood, we consider that this scenario of higher transmissibility of COVID-19 in the same age
group will persist. We assume that rest of the population that will be affected in
herd immunity can be estimated in proportion to the people affected in the age
group j. So to find the susceptible population with respect to the age group j, we
compute the proportion, x = Sj /CMj . This leads us to approximate the number
of susceptible population as,

The Table 2 shows the approximated susceptible population of Bangladesh for
various rate of infection with respect to the age group 21-40. Therefore, if 30% of
the total working population in Bangladesh get affected by COVID-19 to achieve
herd immunity, we estimate that a total number of positive cases would be approximately 17.7 million. Similarly, if 90% of the population at the age group of 21-40
get affected, we would observe a total 53 million positive cases in Bangladesh. If
we consider that 90% of the population at the age group of 21-40, only 31.1% of
the population (53.0 of 170.1 million) of Bangladesh required to be infected by
SARS-COV-2 to be in a state of herd immunity (Figure 3).
The above computation indicates that the herd immunity threshold can be
reduced from 60% to 31% by categorizing the population into age groups. There
is another major reason why we may observe such a low threshold in case of herd
immunity. Due to the closure of all educational institutions from the very early
stage of this pandemic in Bangladesh, the population in the age group 1-20 will not
be the primary agent for spreading the virus. Around 43% of the total population
belong to this age group, hence reducing the herd immunity threshold.

Fig. 4 The dynamics of the active infected cases (A), corresponding hospital requirement
(HR) according to the DGHS guidelines [32], deaths (D), susceptible population (S), and daily
growth cases (G) due to the SARS-COV-2 in Bangladesh has been estimated for the initial
susceptible population of 17.7 million (dash-dotted) and 53.0 million (solid line), respectively.
The horizontal black dotted line represents the available hospital facility (7,034) for the SARSCOV-2 patient in Bangladesh. The confirmed, recovered and death cases for the COVID-19 in
Bangladesh have been taken from John-Hopkins University Database [33] for the analysis.

(UKF). We are explaining the reason why UKF is very important to derive the
dynamics. The differential equations in the SIRD model computes the values for an
instantaneous event. Whereas, the COVID-19 cases that we observe each day is not
instantaneous rather a discrete event on a wider time range. The events of a person
actually being affected, detected, and reported of COVID-19 happen in different
times, and thus loose the required instantaneous effect in the differential equation
based SIRD model. Hence, we use the prediction based UKF model to derive the
dynamics. The Jacobian matrix for designing the UKF algorithm is presented in
the Supplementary Section (Equation 13). The uncertainty associated with the
inference is estimated using the Merwe Sigma Points that deal with the hidden
states of the considered system in an optimal and consistent way for a set of noisy
and/or incomplete observation.
The dynamics of the estimated active cases for both the scenarios considering
53.0 million and 17.7 million initial susceptible population is shown in Figure 4. It
had been reported that the country has the hospital facility of 7,034 SARS-COV2 patients [17]. In a guideline, provided by the Health Ministry of Bangladesh
[32], around 16% of the active cases may need hospitalization [34]. Thus It is
estimated that the hospital facilities should have been filled with the SARS-COV2 patients by the end of June 2020. But we observe contrary scenario as there
remain vacancies in hospital beds [17]. We project that Bangladesh might see
a death cases of 0.3 to 0.9 million people (Figure 4) of whom 37.08% (0.15 to
0.33 million) will be at the age above 60 years. By the end of October 2020, the
number of deaths is estimated to be 10,000 if there is no implementation of effective
pandemic control methods.

Fig. 5 The dynamics of the CFRadj is estimated to be about 2.1 (black solid line) at the
end of the pandemic by considering the cases that have an outcome (recovered/deceased).
The CFR becomes much lower (about half) if it is computed against the active cases (green
dash-dotted). The cross represents the CFR corresponds to the data available. We also present
the CFR for different age groups considering only the confirmed cases. The CFR at the age
below 40 years, is found very low (< 0.6) whereas it will pass over 11.50 for the age above 60
years. In the case of age group 41-60 years, the CFR is estimated to be 3.50.

In epidemiology, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is used to measure the severity
of disease during an outbreak. In general, severity of disease had been defined as
the percentage of affected people died in an outbreak. However, this computation
has several limitations for realizing the current situation in COVID-19 pandemic.
The current definition tends to underestimate the severity as it consider the rate of
deceased people among the total affected people, which consider recovered, death
or active cases alike. Also, this estimation does not consider the time lag between
the identification of a positive case and it’s outcome (recovery and death). This
issue has been discussed in detail in the literature [35, 36, 37]. So, we argue that the
computation should consider the ratio between deceased, and cases with outcome
instead, defined as CFRadj [38]. We predict that at the end of pandemic, the
CFRadj in Bangladesh will be 2.10 (black line in Figure 5).
However, we are also interested in the conventional method of calculating the
CFR where the ratio is considered between the deaths and confirmed cases [39,
40] as we lack sufficient data to compute the CFRadj for different age group.
We show that the CFR has been underestimated (green line in Figure 5) at the
early stage of the pandemic in the traditional method which is well known in the
literature [35, 36, 37]. But as both the CFR and CFRadj converges at the end of
the pandemic(black and green line in Figure 5), we choose to use the conventional
method to estimate the CFR for different age groups using the available data of
Bangladesh (Table 1).
The predicted CFR has a significant variation between the age below 40 and
above 60+ (Figure 5). This difference illustrates the people of age 60+ as the most

vulnerable group in this pandemic. We further estimate the CFR for the age group
of 60+, which is above 11.5. For the age between 41 - 60, the CFR is estimated to
be 3.5 while for the other age groups, the CFR is found to be less than 0.6.

4 Discussion
Based on our estimated population for the herd immunity, we compute the basic
reproduction number to be R0 = 2.5 ± 0.24. Therefore, to break the COVID19 transmission chain and stop the disease from spreading, Bangladesh requires
around 60% of its population to be infected to attain the herd immunity according
to the existing method [41]. But our adjustment shows that if approximately 90% of
the working age group 21-40 get affected by COVID-19 in case of herd immunity
then we can expect a total 31% people will be affected in the whole country
(presented in Table 2).
As we study the policy to contain the COVID-19 crisis in other countries, we
find that Taiwan was able to manage the outbreak without imposing any lockdown
[42], whereas Sweden refused to implement the lockdown claiming it as unnecessary for the nation. Nevertheless, several studies demonstrate the major role of
lockdown to attenuate the contagion, though the negative impact of lockdown on
national economies was not mentioned in those reports [43, 44]. Therefore, it is still
a debate regarding health versus the economy for many countries, especially for a
lower-middle-income country like Bangladesh. In the current state of affairs, herd
immunity seems to be inevitable for COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. However
it might come at the expense of deaths among the vulnerable population. In this
work, we analyzed this crucial trade-off in a systematic approach and synthesized
a set of observations.
1. Rapid Antibody/Antigen Testing Policy: In order to attenuate the community
transmission in Bangladesh, large scale testing strategy should be taken into account by Government policy makers. Since, Bangladesh has limited capacity for
RT-PCR based COVID-19 testing, we propose low-cost rapid antibody/antigen
test as soon as possible. It takes about 20-30 minutes for antibody test and
around 30 minutes for antigen test [45]. The test results can also be made
available to the corresponding health professional instantly. Whereas, RT-PCR
based test requires 6-8 hours to be completed in the lab. In reality, it takes a
few days to be made available to the corresponding health professional due to
the limited lab capacity and increased number of patients. So, we suggest that
each person with COVID-19 symptoms should go through an antibody/antigen
test, and in case of negative results, the person should participate in an RTPCR based test for confirmation. In addition, if we can administer the rapid
antibody/antigen test in the highly affected areas for everyone to get an estimation of what percentage of the population already got affected by COVID-19.
This estimation will greatly help to decide on systematic implementation of
pandemic control methods.
2. Improving Health Services and Awareness: The total number of hospital beds
dedicated for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is about ∼ 7, 000 [17]. According to the current estimation in the Figure 4, hospitals in Bangladesh
should have been filled up by the end of June 2020. But in reality most of the

hospitals remain vacant [17]. One of the major reasons of this situation is the
lack of proper health treatment for COVID-19 patients. There were numerous
news of mistreatment of hospital patients followed by deaths, because of which
people are now treating themselves at home. Another issue is the social stigma
currently inflicted by the COVID-19 crisis. As COVID-19 patients are considered to be cursed, their entire families are being socially rejected throughout
the country. As a result, COVID-19 patients like to keep themselves silent
rather than seeking treatment. Hence, we need to communicate the cause of
COVID-19 and health literacy to improve the situation. In this way, the health
system of Bangladesh can regain its trust to contain the crisis together with
the people.
3. Collecting Pertinent COVID-19 Cases Data: As Bangladesh is going through
health crisis due to COVID-19 for the first time, we need to understand what
policies can be useful for a recovery from this deadly pandemic. Countries
that already became successful to contain the pandemic showed that data
driven approach can be very helpful in this regard. Thus, we want to focus
on collecting the COVID-19 patient data for every single patient from all over
the country. We suggest that each COVID-19 test and patient data should
be collected, reported on time and analyzed centrally. This will help us to
predict the onset of pandemic in any area within the country as well as to
design the appropriate health intervention for different location based on the
need. Proper data collection will also help us to make a reliable forecast about
the progression of the pandemic in the country and thus, in designing proper
control methods.
4. Policy regarding the COVID-19 vaccine allocation in Bangladesh: The COVID19 pandemic has given a harsh note about the dire consequences of serious
diseases without vaccines. It is quite obvious that vaccines played a significant
role to reduce many deaths and disability caused by preventable disease in
many countries. Therefore, bio-pharmaceutical industries are trying around
the clock to develop an effective, safe vaccines and the whole World is pinning
its hope on COVID-19 vaccine to stop the current outbreak. Unfortunately,
this is not the end of puzzle as there will be new challenges once the vaccine
is available in the country. For instance, there needs to be a fair and equitable
process to determine the vaccine allocation in a densely populated country like
Bangladesh. Moreover, the policy makers need to decide who would get the
privilege to be vaccinated first in a community. One may think whether the
elders (age group 60+) should be higher up in the priority list or whether the
kids should get the vaccine before the rest of the population. Since we show
that age group 21-40 is the most exposed group for COVID-19 due to their
social responsibilities in Bangladesh, the policy makers might consider them
on the top of the list to save the socioeconomic structure of the country.
While designing the study and performing the experiment, we faced several
challenges, such as, the limitation of enough COVID-19 tests restricted our understanding of actual scenario in the country, not having the information of COVID-19
test reports in a timely manner from every RT-PCR lab facilities for which making a reliable forecast became very difficult, and unavailability of the dataset in
a standard format from the DGHS and IEDCR made our data analysis task very
difficult. To explain the difficulties, we include a few examples in this manuscript.

For instance, if a person from a family becomes COVID-19 positive, there is a
high probability that the whole family might turn out to be positive. But, due
to the limited number of test capacity, the infected number reported only for a
single member from that family. Moreover, it has not been possible to track each
deceased person who died with COVID-19 symptoms. Again, as the COVID-19
death reports does not mention the comorbidities, it is impossible to understand
the actual cause of each fatality. In addition to these, the government considered a
person as recovered if that person resulted in two consecutive negative COVID-19
tests. But due to negligence, a considerable amount of the COVID-19 patients
did not take the second tests. This resulted inaccurate number of recovered cases,
which the government later adjusted (Figure 4 and 5). Therefore, it has been
very difficult to adjust the SIRD model parameters to represent the pandemic in
Bangladesh accurately. However, we are optimistic that our data-driven mathematical modeling can be used for the policy recommendations and controlling the
disease transmission for the current and future outbreaks in Bangladesh.

5 Conclusions
Evaluation of any pandemic trend is of great importance for a nation and for its
policy makers as it can guide the community towards the use of basic resources
in an efficient way to mitigate the outbreak. In this manuscript, we examine the
COVID-19 progression in Bangladesh by using mathematical modeling and investigate whether the current pandemic trend is destined for the herd immunity. We
estimate that 17.7 to 53 million which is about 10% to 31% of the total population
need to be infected by COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity in Bangladesh. In a
nutshell, our mathematical approach project that herd immunity can be accomplished with less number of infected people than previously estimated [46].
We further analyzed the efficacy of past lockdown in Bangladesh and found out
a similar trend in COVID-19 growth rate despite lifting the countrywide lockdown
in the begining of June, 2020. The instantaneous observation of the pandemic in
Bangladesh, with time-varying reproduction number (Rt ), is found to be independent of the implemented various control methods. Thus, continued decrease
of Rt does not articulate the actual scenario of the pandemic in Bangladesh. The
contraction is clearly visible in the Figure 1, where we see that test positivity rate
is increasing over time as opposed to the decrease of Rt as presented in Figure 2.
Moreover, we also present that the mobility of people in Bangladesh is increasing
over time as opposed to the decreasing Rt and increasing doubling time (Figure 2).
So it is clearly visible that the testing capacity in Bangladesh needs to be ramped
up. Also, COVID-19 test reporting system needs to be updated in a daily basis
with higher precision.
We conclude that, it is debatable as though the country-wide lockdown and
current zoning methods have been able to control the surge of Coronavirus infection in Bangladesh. It has been very difficult to interpret the current situation
based on the COVID-19 test data as we find that total test count has fallen down
despite the fact that test positivity rate is increasing. According to our SIRD estimation, we notice that the current number of confirmed case should be increasing
as both the mobility and test positivity rate are increasing. Thus, Bangladesh
is digressing from the path of containing the pandemic and if such a situation

continues then herd immunity would be inevitable. In conclusion, using the data
driven approach and SIRD modeling, we found that approximately 53.0 million
people (31% of the total population) need to be infected in order to achieve herd
immunity in Bangladesh.
