The rapid onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic has led to multiple challenges for
accurately diagnosing the infection. One of the main bottlenecks for COVID-19 detection is
reagent and material shortages for sample collection, preservation, and purification prior to testing.
Currently, most authorized diagnostic tests require RNA extraction from patient samples and
detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RNA
purification is expensive, time consuming, and requires technical expertise to perform.
Additionally, there have been reported shortages of the RNA purification kits needed for most
tests. With these challenges in mind, we report on extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2
RNA directly from patient samples. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the
CDC singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies/µL. We have
demonstrated these improvements to the current diagnostic workflow, which reduce complexity
and cost, minimize reagent usage, expedite time to results, and increase testing capacity.

Introduction
In December 2019 a pneumonia of unknown cause was detected in Wuhan, China and
reported to the WHO(1). The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly on a global
scale. At the time of this writing, there are more than four and a half million cases of COVID-19
and over 300,000 deaths reported to the WHO with numbers increasing daily(2). In January, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed as the infectious agent
and the full genome sequence(3) was published shortly after, enabling the development of critical
diagnostic tools. Testing is at the core of the COVID-19 response and is critical to abating this
global pandemic.
Currently, the vast majority of approved diagnostics require RNA extraction from
respiratory tract specimens and detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)(4). RNA extraction reproducibly isolates and purifies RNA from upper respiratory tract
samples, including nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs stored in Viral/Universal Transport Media
(VTM/UTM), with minimal loss of original sample. However, RNA purification kits are expensive
and sample processing adds complexity and time to the diagnostic workflow. Most concerning,
months into the COVID-19 pandemic, testing remains dangerously inadequate in part due to
shortages of test materials, including specimen swabs, transport media, and extraction reagents. In
addition, many approved diagnostics, such as the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel, require running three singleplex (one target at a time) reactions per sample(5),
limiting testing throughput.
Streamlining the RT-PCR diagnostic workflow to reduce complexity, time, and reagent
usage could increase testing consistency and capacity. Removing RNA extraction and identifying
alternative reagents that demonstrate equivalent performance to those used in approved COVID19 diagnostics can increase reagent options and alleviate known bottlenecks. Efforts are underway
by multiple groups to achieve these goals. Amplification of SARS-CoV-2 direct from patient
swabs in simple buffers such as PBS(6) or TE (Tris, EDTA)(7) has been recently demonstrated.
Although promising, these workflows do not account for the current clinical practices of collecting

swabs in transport media. Ideally, simplification of COVID-19 diagnostic tests should align with
current clinical practices. Beltran-Pavez et al demonstrated direct amplification from transport
media, but only tested a single type of VTM which resulted in significant amplification
inhibition(8). With current reagent shortages, improvements to diagnostic test workflow should
explore a variety of transport media, including options that can easily be made in-house. The CDC
has an authorized standard operating procedure (SOP) for preparing VTM (SOP#: DSR-052-02.
2020) from readily available reagents when commercial sources of VTM are unavailable(9).
Given the current landscape of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and the need to increase testing
capacity, we have explored directly amplifying viral RNA from multiple commercial transport
media in combination with testing five RT-PCR master mixes (MMs) from different manufactures.
Selection criteria were based on compatibility with specimen collection types, such as NP swabs,
and RT-PCR formulations marketed as having increased inhibitor tolerance and reported to
support direct RT-PCR amplification(10–12). Four of the five MMs are authorized for use with
the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel(5), and one has shown encouraging
results for direct RT-PCR amplification from clinical samples(13).
In addition to exploring extraction-free amplification directly from clinical samples, we
also tested the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel as a multiplex RT-PCR
compared to the three singleplex reactions required currently(14). The CDC 2019-nCoV RealTime RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (referred to as the “CDC singleplex test” from here on) was
released in early February to all US states and 30 international locations. Over 50 molecular
COVID-19 diagnostics have received FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) since the CDC
singleplex test was implemented(15). Multiplexing of the CDC targets has been demonstrated(16)
and five commercial COVID-19 molecular diagnostics are multiplex derivatives of the CDC
singleplex test. However, four of the five multiplex tests require specialized equipment, such as
the BD MAX system(17), and one of the five is approved with a single RT-PCR MM(18)
compared to the four MMs approved with the CDC singleplex test, limiting reagent options.
Demonstrating performance of an extraction-free multiplex RT-PCR from VTM samples for
SARS-CoV-2 detection would reduce complexity, time, and reagent bottlenecks while enhancing
throughput and remaining in line with current clinical practices.
With these goals in mind, we demonstrate that direct amplification from multiple transport
media when paired with inhibitor-tolerant MM formulations is equivalent to approved, more
complex diagnostic protocols. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the CDC
singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies/µL (c/µL) of patient sample.
We have successfully demonstrated improvements to the current diagnostic workflow, which
reduce complexity, may alleviate reagent shortages, shorten time to results, and increase
throughput. The improvements and findings described here may also be suitable for other
pathogen-detection applications and diagnostics.

(Waltham, MA, USA). The Luna Universal Probe One Step RT qPCR kit was purchased from
NEB (Ipswich, MA, USA). The qScript XLT 1-Step RT-qPCR ToughMix and UltraPlex 1-Step
ToughMix were purchased from QuantaBio (Beverly, MA, USA). Molecular biology grade water
was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The S2 VTM was purchased from
S2M Enterprises (Spokane Valley, WA, USA). Amphotericin B and absolute ethanol were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
The 10 mM Tris, pH 8, was prepared in-house with molecular biology grade water. The
in-house VTM (GG-VTM) was prepared according SOP# DSR-052-01 from the USA Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention(9).
Clinical samples. We received 90 de-identified samples from the Washington State
Department of Health (DOH) Public Health Laboratories (Shoreline, WA, USA). The samples
were collected in March 2020 from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs added to VTM and included 30
SARS-CoV-2 positives and 60 negatives. Matched purified RNA was provided for all positive
samples. Half of the negative samples were also provided as purified RNA, but we did not receive
the matched VTM. The remaining 30 negative samples were provided as aliquots of VTM from
NP samples and were purified prior to analysis. Viral loads for all samples were determined using
the CDC singleplex test. All samples were discarded and de-identified and therefore did not
require IRB approval for use.
We also received 78 clinical samples from Discovery Life Sciences (Los Osos, CA, USA),
which were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but 17 were positive for a variety of other respiratory
infections including: influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumoniae, and coronavirus
NL63, HKU1, or OC43. These samples arrived as NP swabs in VTM and RNA was purified from
each sample prior to testing in the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.
RNA purification from clinical samples. For RNA extraction, 140 µL of sample was
purified using the QIAamp Viral Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol(19). Briefly,
AVL lysis buffer was added to the sample and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes.
After incubation, molecular grade absolute ethanol was added and the solution was transferred to
a QIAamp mini spin column. The column was centrifuged for 1 minute at 6000 x g and the flow
through was discarded. The spin column was washed with AW1 buffer and centrifuged for 1
minute at 6000 x g. A second wash was done using AW2 buffer and centrifuged for 3 minutes at
20000 x g and flow through was discarded. Finally, the purified RNA was eluted in 140 µL of
provided elution buffer according to CDC recommendations(14). Purified RNA was stored at -80
˚C. Positive and negative extraction controls were made by spiking either human and SARS-CoV2 RNA or just human RNA into the elution buffer and extracting alongside the clinical samples.
In silico analysis. All CDC primers and probes sequences were analyzed in Geneious
Prime version 2020.0.3 (https://www.geneious.com) and screened for unfavorable folding and
oligomer interactions using AutoDimer Version 1.0(20) with the following conservative
parameters: Minimum SCORE Requirement: 3; Na+ 0.085 M; Temp for dG calc 37°C; Total
Strand Conc 1.0 µM.
Singleplex and multiplex RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. All RT-PCR reactions were run
using the BioRad CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Hercules, CA, USA) with fluorescent
data collected during the annealing step. The final primers and probe concentrations for the
singleplex (one target at a time) reactions were 500 nM and 125 nM, respectively(14). The final
primers and probes concentrations for the multiplex (all three targets simultaneously) reaction
were 500 nM and 250 nM, respectively. All primer and probe sequences are available in Table

Multiplex LoD. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed using TaqPath MM with 10-fold
dilutions of RNA (2x101 – 2x105 each of human RNA and SARS-CoV-2 RNA per reaction) and
compared to corresponding CDC singleplex test for each target (N1, N2, and RP). N3 primers and
probe were omitted as they were removed from the CDC test prior to the onset of this work.
Additionally, multiplex reactions were tested with 0.8 – 8.0 c/µL (c/µL) SARS-CoV-2 RNA with
increasing amounts of human RNA input (101 – 104 c/µL) to assess competitive inhibition.
Purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA was quantified in-house using the BioRad QX200 Digital Droplet
PCR System (Hercules, CA, USA).
Singleplex v. multiplex amplification with patient samples. Purified RNA from clinical
patient samples provided the by the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) Public Health
Laboratories was used as input in both singleplex and multiplex RT-PCR. For each reaction, 5 µL
of sample was added to 15 µL of amplification mix, as described above.
Impact of viral transport media on RT-PCR. The impact of three VTMs (S2, M4RT,
and GG-VTM) on five different RT-PCR MMs was evaluated by spiking SARS-CoV-2 and human
RNA into stock and diluted VTM. Each of the VTMs was diluted with 10 mM Tris, pH 8, at ratios
of 1:10, 1:100, or 1:1000. RNA was spiked in after dilution to maintain a consistent concentration
across dilutions. Control samples were prepared by spiking RNA into 10 mM Tris, pH 8. The
final concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in each sample ranged from 0.8 – 820 c/µL and the final
concentration of human RNA was held constant across all samples at 2000 c/µL. The same
conditions were tested for both the CDC singleplex test and the multiplex test. Thermal cycling
conditions for each MM are outlined in Table 1.

Results
In silico analysis. In silico analysis predicted unfavorable interactions were unlikely
between N1, N2, and RP primers and probes, even if primers and probes were subjected to lower
temperature and higher oligo concentration assay conditions. These results suggested that primers

and probes from the singleplex reactions could be combined into a multiplex reaction without
substantial loss in sensitivity and minimal risk of spurious product formation.
Developing a multiplex RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. For this work, purified SARS-CoV2 RNA was used to evaluate the performance of a multiplex RT-PCR, consisting of N1, N2, and
RP targets from the CDC singleplex test. At a 1:1 ratio of SARS-CoV-2 RNA to human RNA, all
targets were detectable down to 4 c/µL of sample of each RNA per reaction, Figure 1A. The
SARS-CoV-2 input was also held at 0.8, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 c/µL of sample while human RNA input
was increased from 101 – 104 c/µL of sample. Both SARS-CoV-2 targets (N1 and N2) were
detectable for all replicates of 4 c/µL of sample regardless of the amount of human RNA present,
Figure 1B-D. When SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present at 2 c/µL of sample with higher amounts of
human RNA (>103 c/µL) there were dropouts of either N1 or N2 replicates suggesting slight
competitive inhibition. At very low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (0.8 c/µL), the N1 and
N2 targets performed in a stochastic manner.

concentrations of human RNA. At the lower end of SARS-CoV-2 RNA input, all targets were
detectable at 4 c/µL of sample when human RNA ranged from 10 1 – 104 c/µL of sample.
We also tested the specificity of the multiplex RT-PCR using 78 clinical samples from
Discovery Life Sciences. All samples were SARS-CoV-2 negative and 17 were positive for a
variety of other respiratory infections including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus,
pneumoniae, and coronavirus NL63, HKU1, or OC43. None of these samples were positive for
SARS-CoV-2 when tested with the multiplex reaction, Table S2.
After validating the analytical performance of the multiplex assay, we compared singleplex
and multiplex detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA purified from 90 patient samples. We observed
86% concordance with SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and 98% concordance with negative
samples, Table 2. While many of the results were concordant, we observed the N2 signal in the
multiplex reaction dropped below the established LoD more frequently than in the original, CDC
singleplex test. To identify a sample as positive, the CDC EUA requires both N1 and N2 to be
detected. For all the discordant positive samples, N1 was positive while N2 was negative leading
to an overall negative result. Any Ct above 40 was considered a negative result to align with MIQE
guidelines(21). The full set of data for each clinical sample is provided in Table S3.

clinical NP samples. The data are provided as individual targets as well as overall sample
determination. Note, for these data a sample is considered positive if both N1 and N2 are detected
based on the CDC EUA recommendation. *All five SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with no RP
signal had very high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (>105 c/µL), suggesting that the pathogen targets
competitively inhibit the human target during amplification. Ct values and viral loads for each
sample are provided in Table S3.

Impact of viral transport media on RT-PCR. For this work, three common VTMs were
tested in five commercially available RT-PCR MMs to determine the impact of VTM on SARSCoV-2 detection. Purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA and human RNA were spiked into VTM or VTM
diluted in 10 mM Tris at pH 8 (dilutions tested 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000). The fold-change in Ct
values was calculated to determine the impact on amplification (see the Supporting Information
for more details). If a condition did not have a Ct value, it was set to 45, the maximum number of
cycles, to determine a ΔCt.
The first set of experiments tested all VTM/MM combinations for each singleplex reaction:
N1, N2, and RP, Figure 2. Figure S1 reports the ΔCt for each stock VTM/MM combination. The
TaqPath MM was the least inhibitor-tolerant across all three VTMs and at least one replicate had
no detected Ct value for one or more of the targets indicating complete amplification inhibition.
Both the UltraPlex and qScript MMs were the most tolerant and even showed some amplification
enhancement in two of the three VTMs. The M4RT VTM resulted in the most amplification
inhibition, significantly impacting three of the five MMs. Amplification enhancement and/or
inhibition was reduced or entirely removed when VTM was diluted in 10 mM Tris (Figure S2).

Figure 2. Impact of stock VTM on the CDC singleplex test. These data indicate that the
TaqPath MM is the least inhibitor-tolerant while both the UltraPlex and qScript MMs were the
most tolerant and even showed some amplification enhancement. Amplification enhancement
and/or inhibition was reduced or entirely removed when diluted VTM was tested (Figure S2).
The data presented are fold-change in Ct values between RNA spiked in VTM and control
reactions of RNA spiked in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8. If a condition did not have a Ct value it
was set to 45 to generate a difference in Ct. Conditions marked with a “ ” indicate at least one
of the replicates did not have a Ct value after 45 cycles resulting in complete amplification
inhibition. Figure S1 reports the ΔCt for each condition. All reported values are averages of
N=3 per condition. The SARS-CoV-2 and human RNA were kept constant at 820 c/µL and
2000 c/µL, respectively. A. Impact on SARS-CoV-2 N1 target, B. N2 target, and human RP
target.
Next, we assessed the impact of VTM containing low viral RNA copies in the CDC
singleplex test using the qScript MM, which was one of the most inhibitor tolerant MMs tested.
For this work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA varied between 0.4 – 820 c/µL of sample, while the human
RNA was kept constant at 2000 c/µL of sample.
VTM samples amplified in the CDC singleplex test using the qScript MM were able to
reliably detect as few as 2 c/µL of sample, Figure 3. At lower inputs (<0.8 c/µL), amplification
was not observed for all replicates of either the Tris control or VTM samples. In a few cases, the
VTM samples resulted in amplification when the Tris controls did not, again suggesting
amplification enhancement in the presence of some transport media.

Figure 3. Impact of VTM on the CDC singleplex test using the qScript MM with low input
copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The data presented are fold-change in Ct values between RNA
spiked in VTM and control reactions of RNA spiked in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8. Three
replicates are shown for each condition. The black boxes indicate samples where no
amplification signal was detected for both the Tris control and VTM sample. Conditions marked
with a “ ” represent signal in the VTM sample, but no signal in the Tris control indicating
potential amplification enhancement. VTM samples were able to reliably detect as little as 2
c/µL of sample.
From the clinical samples we received, the SARS-CoV-2 positives had viral loads that
ranged between 1x100 – 1x107 c/µL with an average of 6x105 c/µL (Table S3). These clinical
viral load data with the low detection limit of the VTM in RT-PCR, Figure 3, suggest that
amplification directly from clinical samples should accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 without
purification.
In the presence of VTM, the multiplex reaction with qScript MM was able to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA at 2 c/µL of sample for all replicates, regardless of the amount of human RNA, Figure
4. At lower inputs (<0.8 c/µL), amplification was not observed for all replicates of either the Tris
control or VTM samples. In a few cases, the VTM samples resulted in amplification when the
Tris controls did not, again suggesting amplification enhancement in the presence of some
transport media. The same experiment was performed with the TaqPath MM, which showed
significant amplification inhibition of across all VTMs tested (data not shown).

Figure 4. Impact of VTM on the multiplex test using the qScript MM with low input copies of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The data presented are fold-change in Ct values between RNA spiked in
VTM and control reactions of RNA spiked in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 8. Three replicates are
shown for each condition. The black boxes indicate samples where no amplification signal was
detected for both the Tris control and VTM sample. Conditions marked with a “ ” represent
signal in the VTM sample, but no signal in the Tris control sample indicating potential
amplification enhancement. Direct multiplex amplification of VTM samples in the qScript MM
was able to detect as few as 2 c/µL of sample for all replicates.
Next, we combined amplification directly from clinical samples with our multiplex
reaction. This simplified workflow reduced the time-to-result for each sample by at approximately
1.5 hours due to the removal of RNA purification prior to amplification. The clinical samples (NP
swabs in VTM) were received from the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) Public
Health Laboratories (Shoreline, WA, USA). We tested 16 samples (eight SARS-CoV-2 positives
and eight SARS-CoV-2 negatives) with direct amplification using the multiplex RT-PCR and
qScript MM. The viral loads of the eight positive samples ranged from 3.0x10 0 – 2.1x106 c/µL of
VTM (based on purified RNA using the CDC singleplex test). This range was specifically selected
to represent the broad clinical viral loads observed for SARS-CoV-2 infection. With direct
amplification of clinical samples using the multiplex reaction, we saw 8/8 concordance of the
negative samples across all targets. For the SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, only six of the eight
were detected, Table 3, with viral loads ranging from 2.5x101 – 2.1x106 c/µL of sample. Each
sample was run with five replicates to determine concordance with the clinical diagnosis.

the qScript MM. The provided data are separated by results from individual targets as well as the
final concordance call (Yes or No). All samples were run five times and the average result was
used to determine concordance. Note, for these data, a sample is considered positive if both N1
and N2 is positive, as recommended by the CDC(5). Additionally, any Ct above 40 was considered
negative in alignment with standard practices(21).

Discussion
Developing a multiplex RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. We show that the CDC singleplex
test and our multiplex reaction LODs were comparable at 1 c/µL and 4 c/µL, respectively, using
the TaqPath MM. We were able to achieve a slightly improved LoD of 2 c/µL for the multiplex
test when using the qScript MM and RNA spiked into VTM. Additionally, the multiplex reaction
tested with purified RNA from 90 clinical samples showed 86-98% concordance with clinical
diagnoses for positive/negative SARS-CoV-2 results, Table 2. Up to three replicates were run for
these samples to determine concordance, Table S4.
For the multiplex reaction, we observed unexpected results for the N2 target when
increasing the amount of human RNA in the reaction. When the N2 concentration is held constant,

the Ct appears to decrease, rather than remain constant, as the human RNA concentration increases.
We believe this to be signal carryover from the human RP target in the Cy5 channel, Figure 1C.
In Table 2, all the discordant positive samples for the multiplex test detected the N1 target,
but not the N2 target. We reported a concordant positive only if both N1 and N2 were positive to
align with the recommendations from the CDC singleplex test(5). Currently, there are two
commercial assays that only require a single SARS-CoV-2 target for determining a positive
sample(22,23). If our data used these guidelines, the positive concordance would be 100%.
However, using only N1 to determine a positive result would also impact our negative concordance
and drop it from 98% to 93% because there would be three additional false positive samples
detecting N1 and not N2. For the SARS-CoV-2 negative samples, 40 cycles was used as the cut
off value to align with the MIQE guidelines(21).
Impact of viral transport media on RT-PCR. Most clinical samples collected for the
current COVID-19 outbreak are stored in VTM before they are tested. There are multiple
variations of VTM and UTM which maintain the quality of clinical specimens during collection,
transport, and long-term freezer storage because few diagnostic tests are authorized to run at the
point of sample collection. With this well-established clinical practice in mind, ideal COVID-19
tests would be tolerant of VTM to reduce the need for sample clean-up prior to testing.
Additionally, because a consistent supply of a single VTM may be unreliable during this pandemic,
optimal diagnostic tests would be tolerant of a range of transport media. Based on the results
above in Figure 2, both the qScript and UltraPlex perform well in combination with all VTMs and
with low SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. The data from mock samples of RNA spiked into VTM
suggests that RNA purification is not necessary for COVID-19 detection.
Finally, we tested extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples
using the multiplex RT-PCR. These results were promising with 14/16 clinical samples correctly
identified. On-going work is underway to explore additional methods to improve detection direct
from VTM samples including the addition of a simple heat-lysis step prior to amplification.
Previous reports have suggested a heat step may increase the accessibility of the viral RNA
therefore improving amplification efficiency(24).
Recently, there have been reports of up to 33% false negative results with FDA authorized
systems such as the Abbott ID NOW(25). One of the most attractive features of this test is the
simplified workflow: NP samples added directly to the test. Our data also demonstrate a simplified
workflow by directly amplifying samples from NP swabs, and it enables more flexibility in reagent
selection and shows increased specificity.
Overall, this work suggests that eliminating up-front RNA purification and simplifying the
RT-PCR amplification from three singleplex reactions to a multiplex test can significantly reduce
complexity, time, and costs for detecting COVID-19 with the appropriate selection of MM. Ongoing work will explore additional pathways to further streamline this simplified workflow and
expand testing to larger numbers of clinical samples to further validate the approach.
