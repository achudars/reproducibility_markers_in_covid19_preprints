Running Title: IL-13 Predicts Ventilation in COVID-19

Abstract
Severe cases of COVID-19 are characterized by excessive inflammation. Here we
report on an inpatient cohort where plasma cytokines were measured and tested for
association with future need for mechanical ventilation. Hierarchical clustering, KaplanMeier curves, and odds ratios demonstrated that the cluster of IL-13 (OR: 1.57), IL-7
(OR: 1.04) and bFGF (OR: 1.04) was predictive for intubation, independent of age,
gender and comorbidities.

Key words: COVID-19, Ventilation, Immune, Cytokines, IL-13

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is a human coronavirus currently causing the global pandemic COVID-19.
As of June 14th, there were more than 7.6 million cases worldwide and 400,000
fatalities [1]. Complications of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, include
pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe disease is accompanied
by excessive production of cytokines, commonly referred to as cytokine storm, and may
ultimately result in significant lung damage. Cytokine storm, or cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) is often characterized by high levels of IL-6 ,TNFÔÅ°, IL-1ÔÅ¢, and IL-10,
which have all been observed to be elevated in patients with COVID-19 [2,3].
Complications due to cytokine storm can include shock and multiple organ failure and
can be life-threatening. Additionally, patients with comorbidities are more likely to have
worse disease outcomes [4]. For example, chronically elevated proinflammatory
cytokines in diabetics may be a cause of more severe disease due to COVID-19 [5].
The presence of CRS in severe COVID-19 highlights the nature of immune
dysregulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggests an immunopathological response
that may be targetable by therapeutics However, studies from around the world do not
all observe the same immune profiles within their cohorts, and so it may be important to
understand the variability of patient responses, and consider whether personalized
approaches may need to be taken.
Methods
57 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were found using the University of Virginia
Medical Center‚Äôs electronic database. Any remnant EDTA-plasma samples identified by
the clinical laboratory within 48 hours of the time of diagnosis or hospitalization were
collected. Blood was centrifuged at 1300 x g for 10 minutes, then plasma was aliquoted
and stored at -80¬∞C until testing. Demographics (age, gender, race), comorbidities,
hospitalization status, lab results, and other clinical information was obtained from the
electronic medical record (EMR). The collection of biological specimens and deidentified patient information was approved by the University of Virginia Institutional
Review Board (IRB-HSR #22231 and 200110).
Cytokine concentrations in plasma were measured using Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine
27-plex Assay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) on a Bio-Plex 200 suspension array
system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Cytokines detected were IL-1ÔÅ¢, IL-1ra, IL-4, IL-5,
IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17, Eotaxin, bFGF, G-CSF, IFN-ÔÅß, IP10, MCP-1(MCAF), MIP-1ÔÅ°, PDGF-bb, MIP-1ÔÅ¢, RANTES and TNF-ÔÅ°. IL-2, IL-15,
VEGF, and GM-CSF were below the limits of detection in most patients.
COVID-19 patients who ultimately required mechanical ventilation were identified
through the EMR. The cytokine levels at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis or admission
were compared between patients who did and did not require ventilatory support using
a Mann-Whitney U test. A Mann-Whitney U test was also performed to compare
biomarkers between COVID-19 positive patients with elevated blood glucose (>126
mg/dl; n = 19) and patients with normal glucose (<125 mg/dl; n = 19). Patient cytokine

levels were separated into quartiles and log-rank tests were used to generate KaplanMeier curves. Odds ratios were calculated using general logistic regression, and
confidence intervals that did not overlap one were considered statistically significant.
For hierarchical clustering, the pheatmap function in the pheatmap library was used (Rproject.org). Cytokines were scaled by row (patients), and the clustering was calculated
using the complete linkage method. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism and R.
Results
To understand the relationship between the different measured cytokines in our cohort,
we used hierarchical clustering to generate a heatmap for patients and cytokines
(Figure 1A). Cytokines that were clustered in close proximity with one another had
similar expression dynamics within patients, compared to cytokines more distant. IL-6, a
cytokine of high interest for therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 patients, clustered
most closely with IL-5, which is a type 2 cytokine that among other properties, induces
eosinophils [6]. We additionally observed clustering between IL-8 and IL-10, which may
be due to their induction during CRS. Clustering away from these cytokines, were
others including IL-13, IL-7, and IL-1ùõΩ, suggesting these may be differently regulated
responses. Of note there was little visible separation between patients who were
ventilated compared to those who were not through clustering analysis, and no
significant observable pattern in the heatmap. This highlighted the heterogeneity in
responses between patients.
Seven cytokines were found to be elevated in COVID-19 patients that ultimately
required ventilation (Figure S1). These included FGF basic (bFGF) (p=0.0006), IL-7
(p=0.0006), IFN-ÔÅß (p=0.0102), MIP-1ÔÅ° (p=0.0195), IL-13 (p=0.0159), G-CSF (p=0.0368),
and IL-17 (p=0.0448). IL-1ra (p=0.0554) and IL-1ÔÅ¢ (p=0.0707) were also trending
towards being significantly higher in the ventilated patients. For the seven cytokines with
elevated expression in ventilated patients, we performed a logistic regression to
calculate the odds ratio for ventilation status in the patients, while controlling for gender,
age, and presence of comorbidities. For cytokines with significant odds ratios, we then
divided the expression levels into halves or quartiles and generated Kaplan-Meier
curves for time-to-ventilation after admission to the hospital. From this, three cytokines
were found to have significant odds ratios and Kaplan-Meier curves: IL-13, IL-7, and
bFGF (Figure 1B-D). Patients in the top half percentile of IL-13 were significantly more
likely to require ventilation (p = .005). Additionally, IL-13 levels were predictive of
ventilation, with the highest odds ratio of 1.58. IL-7, which is an important for induction
and maintenance of lymphocytes [7] was also predictive of ventilation (OR: 1.04) and
patients in the top three percentiles for IL-7 expression were significantly more likely to
require ventilation (p = .015). Finally, bFGF was also moderately, but significantly,
predictive for ventilation status (OR: 1.04), and the upper three quartiles were also
associated with ventilation (p = .018). When considering these three cytokines together,
we also observed that they clustered closely with one another in Figure 1A.
Finally, to test whether diabetes mellitus was associated with higher levels of
proinflammatory cytokines, COVID-19 positive patients were separated by whether they

had normal (<126 mg/dl) or elevated glucose (>126 mg/dl). Of the cytokines tested,
IFN-ÔÅß (P=0.0011) and IL-1ra (p=0.0042) were significantly higher in patients with
elevated glucose levels (Supplemental Figure 2A-B).
Discussion
The most important finding of this report is the discovery of an immunophenotype
associated with future risk for ventilatory support in patients with COVID-19. Infection
with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a dysregulated immune response, primarily
characterized by elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6, TNFÔÅ°, IL-1ÔÅ¢, and IL-10 in
patients with severe disease [2,3]. The association of these and other proinflammatory
cytokines with severity has suggested that cytokine storm may be a pathologic driver of
disease, and that immune responses may be targetable options for therapeutics. To
observe the relationships between these proinflammatory cytokines in our UVA COVID19 positive patient cohort, we performed hierarchical clustering analyses of their
cytokine levels.
Here we report that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 is predictive of the future need for
ventilation in patients with COVID-19, as well as IL-7 and bFGF. Notably, these three
cytokines clustered together in the dendrogram, as well as significantly correlated with
each other by linear regression (data not shown), suggesting some common regulatory
pathway or response. The proximity of IL-13 to IL-7 may suggest that there is IL-7induced type 2 Innate Lymphocytes (ILC2) or CD4+ Th2 population that produces IL-13.
IL-13 is often considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, but within the lung is known to
promote eosinophilia and tissue remodeling [8]. It can also increase the production of
the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) [9,10], which functions to inhibit IL-1ÔÅ¢ mediated
inflammation. Additionally, IL-1ra absolves inhibition of bFGF by IL-1ÔÅ¢ [11], and may
explain the close clustering between IL-13 and bFGF. In our cohort, however, IL-13 was
not positively correlated with IL-1ra (data not shown), so further studies to understand
this pathway will be required.
Given the interest in elevated IL-6 in patients in other studies, we also tested which
cytokines clustered with IL-6, and saw that IL-5 was most closely linked, suggesting an
association between IL-6 and type 2 immunity, even though IL-6 itself was not
associated with future need for ventilation in this cohort.
Additionally, we observed that patients with elevated blood glucose had increased IFN-ùù≤
and IL-1ra indicating a proinflammatory response. Patients with diabetes mellitus are
known to have excessive inflammation and have been found to have worse outcomes
due to COVID-19 [6]. IFN-ùù≤ is part of the Th1 immune response and an activator of
macrophages, therefore an increase in IFN-ùù≤ may indicate hyperactivation of
macrophages resulting in hyperinflammation of tissues [8,12]. IFN-ùù≤ also recruits other
inflammatory cells that may induce a cytokine storm [12]. Studies with an increased
sample size will be important in understanding the importance of IL-13 and type 2
immunity in patients with diabetes.

Overall, we show that a previously underappreciated cytokine, IL-13, independent of
gender, age, or comorbidity, is associated with worsened outcomes from COVID-19,
highlighting that type 2 immunity may be important to disease. Additionally, higher levels
of proinflammatory IFN-ÔÅß were observed in patients with elevated glucose, suggesting
comorbidities may contribute to excessive inflammation. While functional studies to test
the specific contribution of these cytokines to disease will be crucial, the identification of
their significant predictive capabilities for severe disease increases our understanding of
this infection. Such immunophenotyping may improve diagnostic capabilities, allowing
us to prioritize treatment, and utilize patient-specific approaches.
