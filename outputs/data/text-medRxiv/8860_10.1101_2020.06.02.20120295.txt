Abstract
Background. Emerging evidence indicates a potential role for monocyte in
COVID-19 immunopathology. We investigated two soluble markers of monocyte
activation, sCD14 and sCD163, in covid19 patients with the aim of characterizing
their potential role in monocyte-macrophage disease immunopathology. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind.
Methods. Fifty-nine SARS-Cov-2 positive hospitalized patients, classified
according to ICU or non-ICU admission requirement, were prospectively recruited
and analyzed by ELISA for levels of sCD14 and sCD163, along with other
laboratory parameters, and compared to a healthy control group.
Results. sCD14 and sCD163 levels were significantly higher among COVID-19
patients, independently of ICU admission requirement, compared to the control
group. We found a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and other
inflammatory markers, particularly Interleukin-6, in the non-ICU patients’ group.
sCD163 showed a moderate positive correlation with the time at sampling from
admission, increasing its value over time, independently of severity group.
Conclusions. Monocyte-macrophage activation markers are increased and
correlate with other inflammatory markers in SARS-Cov-2 infection, in
association to hospital admission. These data suggest a potentially preponderant
role

for

monocyte-macrophage

activation

in

immunopathology of covid19 patients.

Introduction
Emerging evidence from SARS-Cov-2 infected patients suggests a key role for
monocyte-macrophage in the immunopathology of COVID-19 infection, with a
predominant monocyte-derived macrophage infiltration observed in severely
damaged lungs [1], and morphological and inflammation-related changes in
peripheral blood monocytes that correlate with the patients’ outcome [2] An
overexuberant inflammatory immune response with production of a cytokine
storm and T-cell immunosuppression are the main hallmarks of severity in these
patients [3]. This clinical course resembles viral-associated hemophagocytic
syndrome (VASH),

a rare severe complication of various viral infections

mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, resulting in multiorgan failure and death
[4]. A chronic expansion of inflammatory monocytes and over-activation of
macrophages have been extensively described in this syndrome [5; 6; 7]. VAHS
has been identifies as a major contributor to death of patients in past pandemics
outbreaks [8] including previous SARS and MERS outbreaks [9] and is currently
suggested for SARS-Cov-2 outbreak. [10]
CD14 and CD163 are both myeloid differentiation markers found primarily
on monocytes and macrophages, and detection of soluble release of both in
plasma is considered a good biomarker of monocyte-macrophage activation [11;
12]. Elevated plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14) are associated to poor
prognosis in VIH-infected patients, are a strong predictor of morbidity and
mortality [13; 14], and associated with diminished CD4+-T cell restoration [15]. In
addition, soluble CD163 (sCD163) plasma levels are a good proxy for monocyte
expansion and disease progression during HIV infection [16]. In measles
infection, a leading cause of death associated with increased susceptibility to
secondary infections and immunosuppression, sCD14 and sCD163 levels were
found to be significantly higher, indicating an important and persistent monocytemacrophage activation [17].
We hypothesized that monocytes/macrophages may be an important
component of immunopathology associated to SARS-Cov-2 infection. In this
paper, we analyze plasma levels of soluble monocyte activation markers in
COVID-19 patients and their correlation with severity and other inflammatory
markers.

Methods
Subjects
We recruited 59 patients with confirmed PCR-positive diagnostic for SARS-Cov2 infection, classified according ICU admission requirement (n=22 patients), or
non-ICU requirement (n=37), and age-matched healthy individuals (n=20) as
control group. Demographic data, main medication treatment and routine lab
clinical parameters including inflammatory biomarkers were collected for all
infected patients. Leftover sera samples from routine analytical control were
employed for the research analysis, after obtaining corresponding informed
consent. Time elapsed from hospital admission to sample extraction was also
recorded.
Measurement of sCD14 and sCD163 serum levels
To determine levels of soluble monocyte activation markers in serum specimens,
appropriate sandwich ELISA (Quantikine, R&D systems, United Kingdom) were
used following manufacturer indications. Briefly, diluted sera samples were
incubated for 3 hours at room temperature in the corresponding microplate strips
coated with capture antibody. After incubation, strips were properly washed and
incubated with the corresponding Human Antibody conjugate for 1 hour. After
washing, reactions were revealed and optical density at 450 nm was determined
in a microplate reader. Concentration levels were interpolated from the standard
curve using a four-parameter logistic (4-PL) curve-fit in Prism8 GraphPad
software. Final values were corrected applying the corresponding dilution factor
employed.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as median and interquartile range. All statistical analyses
were performed using the statistical package R. Mann-Whitney tests were used
for comparison between ICU and non-ICU groups versus healthy controls.
Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to quantify the association between
sCD14 and sCD163 concentration and other lab parameters in non-ICU patients.
Data outliers, falling outside the 1.5 interquartile range, were excluded from the

statistical analysis. The nominal significance level considered was 0.05.
Bonferroni adjustment was used to account for multiple testing.

Results
Demographic and clinical laboratory parameters
Patients in the ICU group showed significant differences in several clinical
laboratory parameters when compared to non-ICU group: lymphocytes, ferritin,
D-dimer, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Procalcitonin (PCT), Interleukin-6 (IL6). The absolute value for circulating monocytes did not show significant
differences between groups. However, these values may have been distorted by
the use of tocilizumab, an IL-6 blocking drug extensively employed in the ICU
group which interferes with monocyte function. Age and time elapsed from
admission to sample extraction did not show differences between groups. Values
are summarized in Table 1.
Serum levels for sCD14 and sCD163
Median levels for sCD14 in sera from ICU patients were 2444.0 (95%CI: 1914.03251.0) ng/ml, compared to 2613.0 (95%CI: 2266.0-2991.0) ng/ml in non-ICU
patients. The healthy control group median value was 1788.0 (95%CI: 1615.01917.0) ng/ml. We observed significant differences for values from infected
patients relative to control group (P-value<0.0001), however no significant
differences were observed between ICU and non-ICU groups. Median levels for
sCD163 in sera from ICU patients were 911.5 (95%CI: 624.7-1167.0) ng/ml, and
910.4 (95%CI: 733.1-1088.0) ng/ml in non-ICU patients. The healthy control
group value was 495.6 (95%CI: 332.5-600.7) ng/ml. In the same way as with
sCD14, we observed significant differences for values from infected patients
compared to control group (P-value<00001), but no differences between ICU and
non-ICU infected patients. Values are summarized in Table 2 and Figure 1.
Correlation between sCD14 and sCD163 levels and time elapsed from hospital
admission
We assessed correlation between sCD14 and sCD163 levels and time elapsed
from hospital admission to sample extraction (Figure 2). We found a significant
positive correlation between sCD163 levels and time elapsed (r2=0.3246, P-

value=0.0156), increasing its value over time of hospital admission. We did not
observe a significant correlation between sCD14 levels and time elapsed from
hospital admission to sample extraction.
Correlation between sCD14 and sCD163 levels and clinical laboratory
parameters
We found significant correlation between sCD14 and sCD163 and several clinical
laboratory parameters in infected patients (in these analysis, adjusted
significance under Bonferrori correction is 0.01), but only in the non-ICU group,
possibly reflecting an interference of the use of tocilizumab or corticoids in the
ICU group. Levels of sCD14 showed a negative correlation with the absolute
value of lymphocytes (r2=-0.5501, P-value=0.0005) and a positive correlation with
levels of LDH (r2=0.5906, P-value=0.0001), CRP (r2=0.6275, P-value<0.0001);
PCT (r2=0.4608, P-value=0.0091), and Ferritin (r2=0.4414, P-value=0.0090)
(Figure 3). No other significative associations were found with other lab
parameters. Levels of sCD163 did not show any significant correlation with
clinical laboratory parameters (Figure 3). Particularly, IL-6 also shows a
significant positive correlation with sCD14 (r2=0.6034, P-value=0.0003) (Figure
4).
Age-dependence of sCD14 and sCD163 levels
We analyzed possible age-dependence of sCD14 and sCD163 levels. Values did
not show association between these biomarker levels and the age of patients.

Discussion
Our results show, for the first time, increased levels of sCD14 and sCD163 in
sera from SARS-Cov-2 infected patients admitted to hospital. We did not observe
any differences between ICU or non-ICU patients, probably due to the
interference on monocyte function produced by the use of tocilizumab and/or
corticoid treatment in ICU patients as previously demonstrated [18; 19]. However,
levels of sCD14 showed a strong correlation with clinical laboratory parameters,
including acute phase reactants (ferritin, LDH, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin)
and a strong correlation with IL- 6 levels in the non-ICU patient group, where no
tocilizumab and/or corticoids treatments were used. Furthermore, sCD163 levels

showed a correlation with the time elapsed from hospital admission to sample
extraction, increasing its value over time of hospital admission, suggesting a
potential indicator of progression of disease.
Monocytes and macrophages constitute a key component of immune
responses against viruses, acting as bridge between innate and adaptive
immunity [20]. Activation of macrophages has been demonstrated to be pivotal in
the pathogenesis of the immunosuppression associated to several viral infections
(VIH, measles), where expansion of specific subsets of monocytes and
macrophages in peripheral blood are observed, and considered to be drivers of
immunopathogenesis [21]. Our results support the hypothesis of a preponderant
role for monocytes in SARS-Cov-2 immunopathology, associated to an over
exuberant immune response. Increased levels of monocyte-macrophage
activation markers and the correlation with other inflammatory biomarkers
(particularly IL-6), indicate a close relationship between monocyte activation and
immunopathology in these patients. Inflammatory markers are closely related to
severity in COVID-19 pathology [22] and selective blockade of IL-6 has been
demonstrated to be a good therapeutic strategy in COVID-19 pathology [23]. Our
results thus suggest that monocyte-macrophage activation can act as driver cells
of the cytokine storm and immunopathology associated to severe clinical course
of COVID-19 patients. Further, monitorization of monocyte activity trough these
soluble activation markers and/or follow-up of circulating inflammatory monocytes
in peripheral blood, could be useful to assess disease progression in the same
way as in other viral infections [16].
In addition, our results identify monocyte-macrophage as a good target for
the design of therapeutic intervention using drugs that inhibit monocytemacrophage activation and differentiation. In this sense, anti-GM CSF inhibitor
drugs, currently under clinical trials for rheumatic and other auto-inflammatory
diseases, might provide satisfactory results in COVID-19 patients. Other drugs
targeting monocyte and/or macrophage could also be useful in COVID-19, as in
other inflammatory diseases [24]. The strategy of inhibiting monocyte
differentiation has proved useful in avoiding cytokine storm syndrome after CART cell immunotherapy [25], suggesting a possible therapeutic application to
COVID-19 immunopathology [26] The present study has several limitations,

including the relatively low numbers of patients tested and the interference of
tocilizumab and corticoids in ICU patients’ results. However, these preliminary
results are strongly suggestive of an important implication of monocytemacrophage in COVID-19 immunopathology, as highlighted by the correlations
found between these biomarker levels and inflammatory parameters. Further
studies using broader series are needed to confirm our findings.
In summary, our data underscore the preponderant role of monocyte and
macrophage immune response in COVID-19 immunopathology and provide
pointers for future interventions in drug strategies and monitoring plans for these
patients.

LEGEND FOR FIGURES
Figure 1. Values of sCD14 and sCD163 in sera samples from patients in ICU,
non-ICU groups, and healthy controls. Results are presented as median and
interquartile range levels in ng/ml. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests were
used for comparison between groups, and P-values for the different comparisons
are displayed.

Figure 2. Correlation between serum levels of sCD14 and sCD163 and time
elapsed from admission to sample extraction in days for all infected patients.
Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r2) and P-value are shown.

Figure 3. Association between serum levels of sCD14 and sCD163, and several
laboratory parameters including Absolute Valor Lymphocytes, LDH, CRP, PCT
and Ferritin in the non-ICU patient group. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r2)
and P-value are shown. LDH: Lactate Dehydrogenase; CRP: C-reactive Protein;
PCT: Procalcitonin

Figure 4. Association between serum levels of sCD14 and IL-6 levels in the nonICU patient group. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r2) and P-value are
presented.
