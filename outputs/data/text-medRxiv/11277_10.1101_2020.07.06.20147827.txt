Abstract
Background: Since December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) occurred in
wuhan, China, and outbreaked rapidly into a global pandemic. This current poses great
challenges to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Objective: To make a comprehensive
evaluation and comparison between HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 and the
general HD patients. Methods: HD patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Wuhan No.5
Hospital were admitted as confirmed group from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020. And HD patients
not infected in our dialysis center were chosen as control group. General characteristics,
laboratory indicators were retrospectively collected, analyzed and compared. Results: A
total of 142 cases were admitted, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 in control
group. Body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in confirmed group than that in control
group (P=0.011). The proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed
group(51.16%) was higher than that in control group(14.14%)(P< 0.001), and the
proportion of three or more underlying diseases in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower
than that in control group(52.53%)(P< 0.001). Patients in confirmed group exhibited
significantly lower hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, and lymphocyte percentage, but higher
neutrophil percentage, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein, aspartate
transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. There was no significant difference in age, gender,
dialysis age, primary disease, the using of ACEI/ARB, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) ,
and other indicators between the two groups. Conclusions: Faced with Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), HD patients with lower BMI and
hemoglobin were more susceptible to be infected, which might be related to malnutrition.
Once confirmed with COVID-19, HD patients expressed obviously dis-regulated of
inflammation and immune.

Introduction
Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus outbreak occurred in wuhan, China[1, 2, 3].
On February 12, 2020, the coronavirus panel of the international committee on the
classification of viruses recommended that novel coronavirus be officially named
"SARS-CoV-2". On the same day, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that
the disease was officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)[4]. As an acute
respiratory infectious disease, COVID-19 has been incorporated into the law of the
People's Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. On
March 11, 2020, WHO officially declared the novel coronavirus into a global pandemic.
Wuhan, as one of the most seriously affected areas, is now out of the woods. But the
global number of confirmed and death cases is raising. By the end of April 24, 2020，the
cumulative number of infected cases was more than 2.8 million cases, and 197,003 deaths
globally.
Previous reports about the clinical characteristics of diagnosed patients in China alerted
that the severity of COVID-19 became more serious in elder people and those with
underlying medical condition(s) [5, 6]. This current poses great challenges to HD patients.
On average, HD patients are elder and have a large numbers of comorbidities. Most of
them must travel to and from the hospital for hemodialysis two or three times a week. And
simultaneously, patients in the dialysis centers are relatively dense and mobile. So it is
urgently necessary to pay more attention to this group of people. so far, epidemiological
data in patients on HD patients confirmed COVID-19 during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is
limited, except for some single cases reported.
In our study, a comprehensive evaluation and comparison between HD patients
confirmed with COVID-19 and the general HD patients were implemented. We aimed to
have a deeper understanding about the clinical features of HD patients after infected with
SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Study design and patients
This was a single-centre, retrospective, observational case-control study. HD patients
diagnosed with COVID-19 from Jan 10 to Mar 15, 2020, were admitted as confirmed
group. We followed the clinical diagnosis criteria for COVID-19 in the New Coronavirus
pneumonia Prevention and Control Program by the National Health Commission of China
[1,7, 8]. At the same time, the ordinary HD patients who were not infected in our dialysis
center at the hospital were chosen as control group. All of them received regular dialysis
(3 times per week, 4 hours each time) in our dialysis center. Patients owning complete
clinical data were selected in our research, and eliminated those infected of HBV, HCV,
HIV, syphilis, and other pathogens. Finally the number of cases were determined: 43 cases
in confirmed group and 99 cases in control group.
Data collection

Data of confirmed group was collected by consulting electronic medical records and
asking patients themselves or their family members. Data of control group was obtained
by logging into Chinese National Renal Data System (CNRD). The basic information
included: age, gender, height, weight, dialysis age, primary disease, underlying disease,
the using of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/ angiotensin receptor blockers
( ACEI/ ARB) in the past one month. Laboratory indicators included white blood cell
count, hemoglobin, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count,
lymphocyte percentage, platelet count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR),
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), C-reactive protein, alanine transaminase, aspartate
transaminase, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase. BMI is
calculated by height and weight: weight (kg) / height2 (m2). In our study, we divided the
patients into 3 categories according to the kinds of underlying disease: ≤1 ( one or less
kind), and 2 (two kinds), ≥3(three or more kinds).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS software (version 25.0). All statistical tests
were conducted by bilateral test, with 95% confidence interval. We present categorical
variables as count (%), and continuous variables as mean ± SD if they were normally
distributed or median (IQR) if they were not. We compared means for continuous
variables by using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed;
otherwise, we used the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared by the
 2 test or Fisher's exact test. A two-sided of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
General characteristics of confirmed HD patients and control patients
A total of 142 cases were admitted. The general information of the two groups was shown
in the Table 1, including 43 cases in confirmed group and 99 cases in control group. There
were significant differences in BMI and underlying disease between the two groups. In the
confirmed group, BMI was slightly lower than that in control group (P=0.011). The
proportion of one or less underlying disease in confirmed group(51.16%) was higher than
in control group(14.14%)(  2=21.71, P< 0.001), and the proportion of three or more
underlying disease in confirmed group(11.63%) was lower than that in control
group(52.53%)(  2=20.86, P< 0.001). While the proportion of two underlying diseases
between them was no difference (P= 0.655).
The average age was 60.77 ± 11.45 year and the median dialysis age was 33.00
(15.00-70.50) months. Male was more predominant in two groups, in which 29(67.44%)
males confirmed and 69(69.7%) males control (P=0.975). Glomerulonephritis (56;
39.44%) was the most common primary disease, followed by hypertensive nephropathy
(43; 30.28%), diabetic nephropathy (39; 27.46%), and others (as obstructive nephropathy,
uric acid nephropathy, the polycystic kidney) (4; 2.82%). 17(39.53%) patients in
confirmed group were taking the ACEI/ARB, and 37(37.37%) cases in control group,
which expressed no difference. There was no statistically significant difference between
the two groups in terms of age, gender, dialysis age, primary disease and the using of
ACEI/ARB.

Discussion
This is the first retrospective case-control study to comprehensively compare clinical
features between HD patients confirmed COVID-19 and those general HD patients. In our
study, there were indeed many differences in two groups, by the observation and
comparison between 43 cases confirmed and 99 cases controlled. These differences were
distributed in general data and laboratory index.
As we all known, the understanding of COVID-19 is gradually improved, and the
diagnosis and treatment program is deepened from the 1st to the 7th. Due to low virus
titers, sampling at late stage of illness, and inappropriate swabbing sites, false negative
cases might be common for COVID-19 infection cases at special period[9]. In order to
reduce rate of misdiagnosis, clinical diagnosis was introduced in the 5th guidelines[7]. Of
43 confirmed patients in our study, 19(44.19%) were with positive RT-PCR Tests for
SARS-CoV-2, and 24 (55.81%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 through clinical
diagnosis. These clinical diagnosis cases were mainly judged by epidemiological history,
clinical manifestations and chest CT scan results, which could ensure their accuracy of
diagnosis.
BMI is closely related to patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). A prospective
cohort study showed that maintaining a normal BMI can slow the development of CKD,
while abnormal BMI can accelerate the progression of CKD to End-stage Renal Disease
(ESRD) [10]. Similarly, in HD patients, together with hemoglobin and serum albumin,
BMI usually represents the nutritional status of HD patients, which is one of the main
factors affecting the prevalence of various diseases and the survival rate in HD patients. In
our study, BMI of patients in confirmed group was significantly lower than that of control
group (P=0.011). Meanwhile, in confirmed group, hemoglobin and albumin were lower
than that in control group. Therefor, we believe that HD patients with lower BMI and
hemoglobin were more susceptible to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, which might be
related to malnutrition.
The differences in laboratory index between confirmed and control groups were
obviously, including lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage,
NLR, C-reactive protein, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase.
Lymphocytopenia is a main feature of critical patients with coronavirus infection, such as
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [11-13]. Elevated inflammatory biomarkers, like C-reactive
protein, interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and ferritin, usually due to the hyperinflammatory
response or secondary infection. Similar to the acute phase of SARS-CoV infection in
humans, SARS-CoV-2 infection also have a hyperinflammatory response and “cytokine
storm” in acute phase, which leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ
failure, and was the leading cause of death [14-17]. This phenomenon also exists in HD
patients. In our study, contrasted with general HD patients, lymphocytes count (P = 0.005)
and lymphocytes percentage (P < 0.001) were lower, and CRP (P < 0.001) higher in those
confirmed after admission. Previous studies have confirmed that, once patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2, NLR was significantly increased and could be used as one of the
intuitive indicators for clinical evaluation of the severity of COVID-19 [18]. In our study,
compared with control group, NLR was significantly increased in confirmed group(P =

0.01). Research suggests that the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer
average hospitalization days [19]. However, there was no significant difference of PLR in
HD patients, which may be related to thrombocytopenia in HD patients[20, 21].
At the same time, neutrophil percentage existed higher in confirmed group in our study.
This phenomenon may be caused by secondary bacterial infections[22]. It has been
recognized that patients of COVID-19 has been damaged with other organs such as liver,
heart and kidney[23]. In this study, we also found that AST and ALP were significantly
higher than the control group, which may be related to other organ damage after
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Similar to MERS-CoV, the risk of infection SARS-CoV-2 in elders and people with
underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes,
hypertension, and chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased [24-27]. In our study,
there existed no significant in age difference between confirmed group and control group,
so as to moderate and severe cases in confirmed group (data was not yet available). This
may be related to the age composition ratio of dialysis patients themselves. In our study,
more underlying disease does not mean higher morbidity. We speculate that because of
more attention from their family, organizations, and themselves, HD patients with more
underlying diseases decrease their frequency of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but that is not
the case for HD patients with less underlying diseases. While the percentage of male was
higher in the two groups, there was no difference in sex ratio between the two groups
(  2=0.071, P=0.789). It has been previously reported that the risk of other diseases, such
as pneumonia and tumor, increased with the extension of dialysis age in HD patients[28],
which is not obviously in the incidence of COVID-19 (P=0.074). As we known,
SARS-CoV-2 is related to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), which is widely
distributed in multiple organs such as lung, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract [29,30].
Upregulation of the ACE2-RAAS pathway is well-known to counter-regulate the
proinflammatory and profibrotic effects of the ACE-Ang II-AT1 receptor axis in
experimental models of HTN and CVD [31-34]. Therefore, it has been speculated that HD
patients who have been or are currently using ACEI/ARB are more likely to be infected
with SARS-CoV-2 and have a worse prognosis. However, in our study, ACEI/ARB did not
significantly increase the incidence and mortality of COVID 19 in HD patient(2=0.059，
P=0.857 ） . Therefore, age, sex, comorbidity, dialysis age and the using of ACEI/ARB
cannot be used as key indicators in assessing the COVID-19 susceptibility factors of HD
patients in our study.
Last but not least, in order to avoid the interference of clinical symptoms and laboratory
indicators, HD patients infected with other pathogen were specifically excluded. In fact, as
a special population, the majority of them have a variety of complications, such as
microinflammatory, heart failure, pulmonary edema, and lung infection[28, 35], resulting
in complicated clinical manifestations and variable chest CT findings. This requires the
medical staff in the dialysis center to master the basic data of all the patients in their own
center. At the same time, under the premise of perfect protection, it is one of the necessary
protective measures to take the screening of nucleic acid testing and chest CT scans for
every hemodialysis patient in the dialysis center.

Our study is limited. Because this is a retrospective case-control study from one single
center, and has a small sample, which could be subject to recall bias and selection bias. In
conclusion, faced with SARS-CoV-2, HD patients with lower BMI and hemoglobin were
more susceptible to be infected, which might be related to malnutrition. Once confirmed
with COVID-19, HD patients expressed obviously dis-regulated of inflammation and
immune. At the same time, we found that age, gender, comorbidities, dialysis age, and the
using of ACEI/ARB could not be used as indicators of susceptibility to COVID-19 in HD
patients. Expecting that our study could be helpful to regions currently suffering from the
ravages of COVID-19.
