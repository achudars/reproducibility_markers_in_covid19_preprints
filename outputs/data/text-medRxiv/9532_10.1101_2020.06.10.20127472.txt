Abstract
The COVID-19 virus has infected millions of people and resulted in hundreds of
thousands of deaths worldwide. By using the logistic regression model, we identified
novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in
154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with
COVID-19 risk, we found that the unitary state system was counter-intuitively
positively associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a
protective factor for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The
prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases
was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Obesity and the condition of unimproved
water sources were associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included
temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, and vitamin D intake. Our
comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and
fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective
strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.

Introduction
Since its first report in December 2019, COVID-19 caused by the 2019 novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread across 215 countries and territories 1. As of May
15, 2020, more than 4,500,000 COVID-19 cases and 300,000 deaths were reported 1.
Compared to other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2
has a significantly higher infectivity potential that makes it spread across the world
rapidly and has caused a global pandemic 2. Meanwhile, the fatality rate for COVID19 is not low, making SARS-CoV-2 more destructive than the previously emerging
coronaviruses 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has established the most critical global
health and economic crisis in recent years 4. But even worse, its development is difficult
to forecast 5. Previous studies have identified individual factors associated with
the spread of COVID-19. For example, temperature and humidity may impact the
transmission of COVID-19

67

. Social distancing can significantly reduce COVID-19

transmission 8 9. Besides, some factors associated with the COVID-19 death risk have
been identified, such as age, sex, and comorbidities 10 11. Some factors, such as diet and
nutrition

12 13

, have been associated with both COVID-19 infection and mortality.

Nevertheless, one standard limitation of these studies is that they ignored the
interdependence between different factors. As a result, they might not accurately
describe the relationships between some factors and COVID-19.

To simultaneously identify different factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and
fatality, we used logistic models to predict population-adjusted confirmed cases (per

one million) and deaths (per one million) and case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19
in different countries and in the 50 U.S. states. We collected data related to politics,
economy, culture, demographic, geography, education, medical resource, scientific
development, environment, diseases, diet, and nutrition. Based on these data, we
defined tens of factors (variables) that could affect COVID-19 transmission and fatality.
We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 14 to select the factors
associated with COVID-19 risk. We identified novel factors associated with COVID19 risk. We also confirmed some controversial factors and most of the well-recognized
factors associated with COVID-19 risk.

Results
Identifying factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality in
different countries
We first used the LASSO to evaluate the contribution of the 77 variables to COVID-19
cases, deaths, or CFRs. The Lasso selected 57 variables with a nonzero Î²-coefficient in
at least one of the three predictive models for COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs (Fig.
1). As expected, the three social distancing-associated factors (large-scale sports,
religious, and cultural events) represented positive predictors of COVID-19 deaths
and/or CFRs. The Lasso selected two temperature types (medium and low) in at least
one predictive model. The medium temperature was a positive predictor of COVID-19
deaths, while the low temperature was a negative predictor of COVID-19 deaths and
CFRs. These data, together with the findings from previous studies

67

, suggest that

the risk of COVID-19 transmission is high in a preferential temperature range, but it
will decline with the temperature rising or falling outside the range. The humidity was
a negative predictor of COVID-19 cases, consistent with the finding from a previous
study 7. The negative association between humidity and COVID-19 risk was following
two other findings: i) the island country was a negative predictor of COVID-19 deaths
(the weather is humid in island countries), and ii) the arid climate was a positive
predictor of COVID-19 deaths. Besides, we found that the temperate climate was a
positive predictor of COVID-19 CFRs, while the cold climate was a negative predictor
of COVID-19 CFRs. Again, these results suggest that temperature has a prominent
association with COVID-19 risk. Surprisingly, the cold climate was a positive predictor
of COVID-19 cases, in contrast with its negative association with CFRs. The latitude
was a negative predictor of COVID-19 deaths and CFRs, mainly because it is one of
the main factors that affect temperature, which has an essential association with
COVID-19 risk. In contrast, the longitude was a positive predictor of COVID-19 cases
and deaths. The sex ratio (male/female) was a positive predictor of COVID-19 cases,
while the percentage of the population aged < 10 years was a negative predictor of
COVID-19 cases and deaths. It is in agreement with previous findings that sex and age
were significantly associated with COVID-19 risk 10 11. Islam was a positive predictor
of COVID-19 cases, and Christianism was a positive predictor of CFRs. In contrast,
Buddhism and other religions were negative predictors of COVID-19 cases, deaths,
and/or CFRs. These results could be associated with the fact that Islam and Christianism
have relatively large and regular gathering activities that facilitate the transmission of

COVID-19. Among the four races, the White was a positive predictor of COVID-19
deaths, and the Asian and Arab were negative predictors of COVID-19 cases. These
results conform to the fact that the countries reporting a large number of COVID-19
deaths were mainly majority-white countries. In fact, among the 24 countries with
COVID-19 deaths > 1,000 as of May 15, 2020, 18 countries were majority white,
including 14 European and 4 American countries (USA, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico).
Interestingly, we found that particular food or nutrition intake was associated with
COVID-19 risk. For example, increased intake of vegetables, grain, sugar, protein, fat,
vitamin D, and vitamin K was associated with reduced COVID-19 cases, deaths, and/or
CFRs. In contrast, increased intake of fruits, dairy products, vitamin B, and vitamin C
was associated with increased COVID-19 cases, deaths, and/or CFRs. The negative
association between vitamin D intake and COVID-19 risk is consistent with previous
reports

12 13

. The condition of unimproved water sources was a positive predictor of

CFRs, suggesting the potential of COVID-19 spreading through water. The air
passenger traffic and vehicle usage were a positive and a negative predictor of COVID19 deaths, respectively, and the railway length was not selected by the Lasso for
predicting COVID-19 cases, deaths, or CFRs. This indicates that air transport is the
most dangerous approach for COVID-19 transmission compared to other modes of
transport. It is reasonable since small closed spaces on airplanes are prone to virus
transmission. The percentage of urban population was a positive and a negative
predictor of COVID-19 cases and CFRs, respectively. A possible explanation is that
dense urban population is conducive to COVID-19 transmission, while excellent urban

medical conditions are conducive to the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The average
age of childbirth was a positive predictor of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs, and
the life expectancy was a positive predictor of COVID-19 deaths. These results suggest
a positive association between age and COVID-19 risk.

We also obtained some unexpected findings. For example, the economic development
(per capita income) and health investment (universal health coverage index, health
expenditure, and hospital beds per 1,000 people) were positive predictors of COVID19 cases, deaths, and/or CFRs. The smoking rate was a negative predictor of COVID19 cases and deaths, consistent with the recent finding that smoking was a protective
factor for COVID-19 infection 15. Nevertheless, an association between smoking and
COVID-19 CFRs was not observed in our model, suggesting that smoking is not likely
to reduce the mortality risk of COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of some diseases,
such as HIV and diabetes, were inversely associated with COVID-19 risk. The
prevalence of malnutrition was inversely associated with COVID-19 cases but was
positively associated with COVID-19 CFRs. The percentages of the population with
BMI < 18 and BMI > 30 were negatively and positively associated with COVID-19
cases, respectively, suggesting that obesity could be a risk factor for COVID-19. The
unitary state system was a positive predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths, suggesting
that it is less effective in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks than the federation system.
This conflicts with common sense that the centralization system is capable of
concentrating resources more efficiently than the decentralization system in fighting

against COVID-19.

Identifying factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality in
the 50 U.S. states
To uncover the critical factors for COVID-19 risk within a single country, we used
logistic models to predict COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs in the 50 U.S. states. We
used 55 variables in the predictive models, most of which were in the list of variables
mentioned earlier. Likewise, we first used the LASSO to determine the contribution of
the 55 variables to COVID-19 cases, deaths, or CFRs. We defined the states as having
low or high COVID-19 cases, deaths, or CFRs based on their median values. The next
steps followed the previous method. The Lasso selected 31 variables with a nonzero Î²coefficient in at least one of the three predictive models for COVID-19 cases, deaths,
and CFRs (Fig. 2). Consistent with the previous results, medium temperature, arid
climate, social distancing (major sports events), per capita income, longitude, and the
average age of childbirth were positive predictors of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and/or
CFRs, and humidity, smoking rate, and international tourism revenue were negative
predictors. The urbanization level was a positive predictor of COVID-19 cases, while
it was a negative predictor of COVID-19 deaths and CFRs. We have also obtained some
findings that were special in the U.S. setting. For example, the death rate of influenza
and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases were negative predictors of
COVID-19 cases, deaths, and/or CFRs. A potential explanation of the negative
association between the prevalence of influenza and pneumonia and COVID-19 risk is

that there is cross-reactive immunity between other types of viruses and SARS-CoV-2
16

. The prevalence of diabetes was a positive predictor of COVID-19 CFRs, indicating

that it is a risk factor for COVID-19 fatality. However, in both world and U.S. settings,
it was a negative predictor of COVID-19 cases, indicating that it is a protective factor
for COVID-19 infection. Health insurance coverage was positively associated with
COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs. The level of CO2 emissions per capita was
negatively associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths. The Black was a positive
predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths, consistent with previous reports

17

. The

geographic location correlated with COVID-19 risk where landlocked country and
coastal region had lower risk and the great lakes region had a higher risk. Besides, the
usage of private transport in urban might reduce COVID-19 risk.

Ranking variables based on their importance in distinguishing
between low and high COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs
In predicting COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs, we achieved the AUC values of 0.90,
0.90, and 0.85, respectively, on the training set, and 0.95, 0.98, and 0.85, respectively,
on the test set in countries, and all AUC values > 0.8 in the 50 U.S. states (Figs. 1
and 2). These results demonstrate that the variables selected by the LASSO
represent important factors affecting COVID-19 risk. We ranked the importance of
variables in distinguishing between low and high COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs
based on the chi-square statistic. In the world setting, per capita income, malnutrition,
aged < 10 years, urbanization level, dairy product intake, BMI < 18, hospital beds, BMI >

30, longitude, and protein intake were the ten most essential variables in distinguishing
between low and high COVID-19 cases (Fig. 3A). The ten most important variables in
distinguishing between low and high COVID-19 deaths were life expectancy, aged <
10 years, universal health coverage, per capita income, longitude, vitamin C intake, fat
intake, hospital beds, domestic tourism, and health expenditure (Fig. 3A). Latitude,
measle immunization, major sports events, internet usage, urbanization level,
malnutrition, unimproved water sources, vehicle usage, cold climate, and domestic
tourism were the ten most important variables in distinguishing between low and high
COVID-19 CFRs (Fig. 3A). These results collectively demonstrate that age, climate,

and

nutrient intake are mostly associated with COVID-19 risk. We obtained similar results
in the U.S. setting except influenza and race being two prominent factors for COVID19 risk (Fig. 3B).

Associations of blood type, social distancing, and temperature with
COVID-19 transmission and fatality
To investigate the association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19
vulnerability, we also collected ABO blood type distribution (population proportion)
by country. We obtained the complete ABO blood type distribution data in 94 countries.
We found that blood type A had significant positive correlations with COVID-19 cases
(Spearman's correlation test, Ï = 0.47, P = 1.97 Ã 10-6) and deaths (Ï = 0.58, P = 6.23
Ã 10-10) (Fig. 4A). The correlation between blood type A and COVID-19 CFRs was not

significant (Ï = 0.18, P = 0.09). Overall, these results indicate that blood type A is
associated with an increased risk of COVID-19, consistent with a recent report

18

. In

contrast, blood type B displayed significant inverse correlations with COVID-19 cases
(Ï = -0.41, P = 3.91 Ã 10-5), deaths (Ï = -0.50, P = 2.63 Ã 10-7), and CFRs (Ï = -0.34, P
= 8.91 Ã 10-4) (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that blood type B is associated with a
reduced risk of COVID-19. The association between the ABO blood type and COVID19 vulnerability may partially explain why the COVID-19 outbreak is serious in Europe
and relatively moderate in South Asia since blood type A has a high frequency in
Europe, and blood type B has a high frequency in South Asia 19 20.

To investigate the association between social distancing and COVID-19 spread, we
analyzed the correlations between major sports events from January 2020 to March
2020 and COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs in 38 European countries. We focused
on European countries because sports, particularly football, are highly popular in most
countries in Europe. We classified 38 European countries into two groups. The first
group contained 20 countries hosting major sports events, including Six Nations
Championship, UEFA Europa League, and domestic football matches from January
2020 to March 2020, and the second group contained 18 countries hosting no major
sports events during this period. We found that COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs
were significantly higher in the first group than in the second group (one-sided Mannâ
Whitney U test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). The mean COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs
were 1.61, 6.29, and 2.59 times higher in the first group than that in the second group,

respectively. Moreover, within the 20 countries hosting major sports events, the total
numbers of participants in the major sports events had significant positive correlations
with COVID-19 cases (Ï = 0.51, P = 0.02), deaths (Ï = 0.63, P = 0.004), and CFRs (Ï
= 0.46, P = 0.04) (Fig. 4B). Football is the most popular sport in almost all European
countries, and the top five European leagues were subject to a large number of live
audiences. As expected, the five countries with the top five European leagues, including
UK, Spain, Italy, France, and Germany, had significantly higher COVID-19 cases,
deaths, and CFRs than the other European countries (one-sided MannâWhitney U test,
P < 0.01, fold change > 2) (Fig. 4B). Altogether, these results suggest that major sports
events can boost COVID-19 transmission and highlight the importance of social
distancing in mitigating COVID-19 spread.

The association between temperature and COVID-19 transmission has been well
recognized

6 7 21

. To compare the relative contribution of high and low temperature in

predicting COVID-19 risk, we built logistic models with both variables to predict
COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs in the 154 countries. As expected, both high and
low temperatures were negative predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths. However,
the high temperature displayed a significantly stronger power than the low temperature
in predicting COVID-19 cases and deaths (Fig. 4C). This indicates that high
temperature is a more compelling factor mitigating COVID-19 transmission than low
temperature.

Discussion
We comprehensively described the most associated factors affecting COVID-19
transmission and fatality. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, the
unitary state system was counter-intuitively positively associated with increased
COVID-19 cases and deaths. Blood type B was a protective factor for COVID-19 risk,
while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV, influenza and pneumonia,
and chronic lower respiratory diseases was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk.
Obesity and the condition of unimproved water sources were associated with increased
COVID-19 risk. Other factors included temperature, humidity, social distancing,
smoking, and vitamin D intake. The factors most associated with COVID-19 risk
included age, climate, social distancing, economic development, health investment,
weight, and nutrient intake.

This study is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, we used the LASSO to evaluate
the contribution of different variables to COVID-19 cases, deaths, or case fatality rates
(CFRs) and identified the most critical factors associated with COVID-19 based on data
related to politics, economy, culture, demographic, geography, education, medical
resource, scientific development, environment, diseases, diet, and nutrition. This
method overcame the limitation of previous univariate analyses that ignored the
interdependence between different factors. Second, we identified novel factors
associated with COVID19, including the unitary state governing system as a positive
predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths, blood type B as a protective factor for

COVID-19 risk, the negative associations between the prevalence of HIV, influenza
and pneumonia, and chronic lower respiratory diseases and COVID-19 risk, and the
positive associations between economic development, education expenditure, obesity,
and condition of unimproved water sources and COVID-19 risk. Third, we confirmed
some controversial factors associated with COVID-19, including smoking and vitamin
D intake as protective factors and blood type A as a risk factor for COVID-19. Finally,
this study demonstrates that age, climate, social distancing, economic development,
health investment, weight, nutrient intake, influenza, and race are the most prominent
factors for COVID-19.

This study has several limitations. First, because the capacity for testing for COVID-19
patients varies among different countries, the reported COVID-19 cases may not fully
represent the actual situation of COVID-19 outbreaks in some countries that could
affect the accuracy of our predictive models. Second, the sample size is not sufficiently
large in terms of the number of predictors we used. As a result, the Î²-coefficients of
some variables were small, so that their associations with COVID-19 risk were
ambiguous.

Conclusions
Numerous factors may affect COVID-19 transmission and fatality, of which age,
climate, social distancing, economic development, health investment, weight, and
nutrient intake are most significant. Our comprehensive identification of the factors

affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the
COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating
COVID-19 spread.

Methods
Materials
We defined 77 variables that could affect COVID-19 transmission and fatality in
different countries. These variables included population density, life expectancy, sex
ratio (number of males per 100 females), percentage of population aged < 10 years,
percentage of population aged â¥ 70 years, percentage of urban population, percentages
of population with body mass index (BMI) > 30 and BMI < 18, PM2.5 value (particles
less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter), percentage of population using unimproved
water sources, prevalence of tuberculosis, prevalence of diabetes, prevalence of HIV,
smoking rate among people aged > 15 years, two immunization (DPT and measles)
coverages among children ages 12-23 months, average age of childbirth, three types of
geographic location (inland, island, and other), three temperature types (high (>
23.5 â), medium ([0.7, 23.5] â), low (< 0.7 â) ), humidity, latitude, longitude, five
climate types (tropical, arid, temperate, cold, and other), four religions (Islam,
Christianism, Buddhism, and other), governing system (unitary state or federation),
Gini index, per capita income, universal health coverage index, government
expenditure on health (% of GDP), hospital beds per 1,000 people, government
expenditure on education (% of GDP), number of live audiences in major sports events,

number of participants in large-scale religious activities, number of participants in
large-scale cultural events, birthrate, natimortality, prevalence of malnutrition, number
of scientific papers published, human development index, international tourism
expenditure, international tourism revenue, domestic tourism expenditure, air
passenger traffic, railway length, vehicle usage, percentage of population using the
internet, 16 classes of food and nutrient intake (vegetables, fruits, grain, dairy products,
edible oil, fat, sugar, alcohol, trace elements, protein, vitamin A, B, C, D, E, and K),
and four races (White, Black, Asian, and Arab). We downloaded the latest version of
these data from major repositories of authoritative statistics. The major sports events,
religious activities, and cultural events were the records from January to March 2020.
A description of these variables is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Besides, we
defined 55 variables that could affect COVID-19 transmission and fatality in different
states of the United States. A description of these variables is shown in Supplementary
Table S2. We collected confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, and case fatality rates
(CFRs) in different countries and in the 50 U.S. states as of May 15, 2020, from the
COVID-19 Dashboard of Johns Hopkins University 1. As suggested in a recent
publication

22

, we calculated the CFRs on a given day by dividing the number of

COVID-19 deaths on that day by the number of cases 14 days before.

Machine learning model
We defined the countries as having low or high COVID-19 cases, deaths, or CFRs using
the 40th and 60th percentiles. We separated the data set into a training set and a test set,

which contained three quarters and the remaining one quarter of the samples,
respectively. We used the LASSO on the training set with 5-fold cross validation (CV)
and selected the variables with a nonzero Î²-coefficient in the LASSO. Using the
selected variables, we built a ridge logistic model on the training set and applied it to
the test set. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive model using
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Ranking variables by importance
For continuous variables, we discretized them using the top-down discretization
method 23. We ranked the importance of all variables based on the chi-squared statistics.
We performed data discretization using the R function âdisc.Topdownâ in the R
package âdiscretizationâ and feature ranking using the R function âchi.squaredâ in the
R package âmlr.â

Statistical analysis
We performed comparisons of two groups using the one-sided MannâWhitney U test.
We evaluated the correlations of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and CFRs with other
variables using the Spearman's correlation test. The correlation test P-value and
correlation coefficient (Ï) were reported.
