Abstract

11

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), the biggest health problem at present, doesn’t have

12

uniform transmission and severity among the countries and communities therein. Knowledge

13

of community vulnerability to the disease would facilitate interventions aimed at transmission

14

control by the efficient deployment of available limited resources. Therefore, we assessed

15

spatial variations and heterogeneity of disease vulnerability among the population in 753

16

municipal units of Nepal. We collected geospatial indicators representing the domain of

17

socioeconomic inequalities, population dynamics, heterogeneity in accessibility and the

18

information related to underlying health condition which potentially affect the severity of

19

COVID-19 transmission. Those indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices

20

using Geographic Information System (GIS); Social Vulnerability Index (SVI),

21

Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two- Social and

22

Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI). The indicators were scaled to a common

23

measurement scale and spatially overlaid via equally weighted arithmetic mean. The indices

24

were classified into five level of risk and the municipal units and the population within

25

vulnerabilities classes were quantified and visualized in the map. The index output indicated

26

high vulnerability to epidemics in megacities like Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur, etc.;

developing cities especially in the Province No 2; and, municipal units of Karnali and

28

Sudoorpashchim provinces. Additionally, some other municipalities such as Dhulikhel,

29

Beshishahar, Tansen etc. which have a higher prevalence of pulmonary and cardiovascular

30

disorders are highly vulnerable. The SVI indicated that 174 municipal units and 41.5%

31

population is highly vulnerable. The EVI identified 55 municipal units and 40.7% of the total

32

population of the country highly vulnerable to COVID-19. The SEVI accounted that disease

33

vulnerability is high in 105 municipal units and 40% population of Nepal. The vulnerability

34

indices created are means for different tiers of the existing government in federal system of

35

Nepal for prioritization and improved planning for disease intervention especially in highly

36

vulnerable municipal units where the COVID-19 transmission could have high severity.

1 | Introduction

39

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a zoonotic disease caused by an RNA virus known

40

as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reported from Wuhan,

41

China in December 2019 (Huang et al. 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) has

42

declared the disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern

43

(PHEIC) on 31st January 2020 (WHO 2020a). The COVID-19 pandemic, as of 25th June 2020,

44

has spread exponentially to 215 countries, areas and territories, infecting 9,296,202 people and

45

causing over 479,133 deaths (WHO 2020b). The mortality rate of the disease has been 5.15 per

46

thousand infections. The intensity of its spread and the rate of mortality is not even among the

47

spatial extents like continents, countries and geographical areas such as counties; communities,

48

age-groups and sexes (Baud et al. 2020, Wadhera et al. 2020, WHO 2020b). Higher rate of

49

transmission and mortality have been recorded from the areas of dense settlement and heavy

50

flow of people. About 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild or asymptomatic disease,

51

therefore, symptom-based control is unlikely to be sufficient (Anderson et al. 2020, WHO

52

2020a). The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, i.e. the mean number of secondary

53

cases generated by one primary case when the population is largely susceptible to infection,

54

had a value of about 2.5 in the earlier days of outbreak (Liu et al. 2020) that has substantially

55

been lowered with the impose of social distancing measures (Rothan & Byrareddy 2020). The

56

greater the reduction in transmission, the longer and flatter will be the epidemic curve; for

57

which early self-isolation and social distancing are the keys. Despite rigorous global efforts,

58

COVID-19 is continuously spreading across the world causing significant illness and death

59

(WHO 2020b). No vaccine or effective antiviral drug is likely to be available soon as the

60

process will take time (Anderson et al. 2020).

61

Severity of a pandemic is not uniform in all societies (Wadhera et al. 2020). Social vulnerability

62

theory posits that “societal inequalities exist based on class, race, ethnicity, gender, age, health,

63

abilities, etc.” (Cannon 1994). Differences in socioeconomic factors impose different degree

64

of impacts from hazards (Mwarumba 2017). Vulnerability includes exposure to detrimental

65

environmental or social strains, susceptibility to those strains, and the capacity to adapt (Adger

66

2006). Being more specific to a disease, vulnerability is the elevated exposure to infection;

67

increased susceptibility to the disease including its complications, hospitalizations, and death;

68

and lack of access to health care (Frankel 2011). People living with smallest number of choices

69

and forced lives from poverty, gender and ethnic discrimination, physical disability, limited

70

employment opportunities, and other forms of domination are the most vulnerable to such

71

disasters (Cannon 1994). Severity indices of the community to the disease could explain

72

possible relationships underlying the temporal and spatial aspects of its diffusion.

73

The severity of COVID-19 is higher in areas of higher population density (Coccia 2020,

74

Rocklöv & Sjödin 2020, Wadhera et al. 2020) and their movement (Tuite et al. 2020, You et

75

al. 2020). Higher population density lowers the efficacy of social distancing and adds

76

complications in the contact tracing of the COVID-19 patients that ultimately increases the R0

77

(Anderson et al. 2020, Rocklöv & Sjödin 2020). The disease incidence in children seems to be

78

lower than in the rest of the population (Sominsky et al. 2020, Wu & McGoogan 2020), so is

79

the disease accounted mortality rate (Dong et al. 2020). Pre-existing chronic medical conditions

80

such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular diseases such as high

81

blood pressure, diabetes etc. may predispose adults to more severe outcomes of the disease

82

(Fang et al. 2020, Yang et al. 2020, Zheng et al. 2020). The innate immune mechanism is less

83

efficient in elderly people that makes them more vulnerable to severe outcomes of infectious

84

diseases (Boe et al. 2017). Communities having dense population dominated by the elderly

85

people with compromised immunity presumably have higher vulnerability to the COVID-19

86

disease.

87

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the countries across the globe have imposed

88

lockdown, due to which a large number of people have lost their job. Such people rush to their

89

country and hometown, legally or illegally, without proper precautions. The movement of large

90

groups of unprotected, non-immune, physically weakened and possibly infected people

91

between different zones can increase the vulnerability of migrants and their host community to

92

the pandemic (Bates et al. 2004). Poverty is one of the major determinants of the disease

93

vulnerability as poor people have limitations in resource mobility and disease treatment. Hence,

94

poverty is known as the “carrier status” of disease (Semenza & Giesecke 2008). Delays in

95

diagnosis and treatment of epidemics are associated with worse transmission, morbidity and

96

mortality (Bates et al. 2004). Additionally, poverty associated illiteracy leads to

97

disproportionate misinformation and miscommunication among individuals with less access to

98

information channels, who fail to maintain necessary precautions against the disease.

99

Undernutrition and lack of sanitation can worsen the situation of the pandemic by boosted

100

diffusion and higher mortality. Health facilities are not adequate and accessible to all people in

101

developing countries. Inequalities in geographic accessibility to healthcare even in developed

102

countries like the United States have been documented to cause negative health outcomes for

103

epidemics (Mollalo et al. 2020). Inability to access health care is a major obstacle to initiation

104

of early treatment and prevent the transmission dynamics. Timely diagnosis, isolation and

105

treatment is crucial for the control of pandemics like COVID-19 (Ji et al. 2020). Because almost

106

all of the medical facilities meeting basic requirements for COVID-19 identification and

107

treatment are in the city areas, travel time to hospitals and cities can be one of the important

108

determinants of the vulnerability.

109

Large number of literatures have surged in the short period of time after COVID-19 outbreak,

110

however, most of them are from the medical sciences using clinical and serological data. For

111

the proper management and control of such pandemics it is equally important to know the

112

transmission dynamics and identify the vulnerable group of people. Geospatial analysis using

113

socioeconomic, demographic and geophysical data would be helpful to restrain the disease.

114

Geographic information system (GIS) is an essential tool to examine the spatial distribution of

115

infectious diseases (Acharya et al. 2018, Kang et al. 2020). However, a limited number of GIS-

116

based studies have been published since the initial outbreak of COVID-19 (Kamel Boulos &

117

Geraghty 2020, Kang et al. 2020, Macharia et al. 2020, Mollalo et al. 2020, Sarwar et al. 2020).

118

Assessment of the disease risk level is important for preparedness and response. It is vital to

119

explain the determining factors of the transmission dynamics of this highly infectious disease

120

for designing strategies to control diffusion, empowering health policy with economic, social

121

and environmental interventions (Coccia 2020). However, real risk of infection and death

122

depends on a number of factors including domain of population structure, socioeconomic

123

heterogeneity and underlying health condition of population. By the date of 25th June 2020,

124

COVID-19 has accounted a total of 11,162 infections and 26 deaths from 76 of the 77 districts

125

within Nepal territory (MoHP 2020). Most of those cases of the disease in Nepal are among

126

mass return migrants from India, China and other areas, except few suspected community level

127

transmission cases in Birgung, Nepalgunj and Udaypur (Tharu et al. 2020). If the community

128

level transmission of COVID-19 or other epidemics starts, it is important to identify the most

129

vulnerable communities and areas such that available limited resources could be efficiently and

130

timely deployed in those priority zones. This knowledge would facilitate interventions aimed

131

at transmission control and patient care, minimizing the collective and individual burden of the

132

pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to explore- i) demographic and health resource accessibility

133

inequities; ii) socioeconomic inequities; iii) disease prevalence inequities; and, iii) severity

134

indices to epidemics among 753 municipal units of Nepal. We used demographic,

135

socioeconomic and spatial data, and GIS tools to identify the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI),

136

Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two, the Social-

137

Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI).

2.1 | Study area

140

This study was conducted covering entire 753 municipal units in Nepal. The municipal units

141

include four categories: six metropolitan cities, 11 sub-metropolitan cities, 276 municipalities

142

and 460 rural municipalities. These units are third tire of government in the federal structure of

143

Nepal. Administratively these municipal units come under third hierarchy after the province

144

(n=7) and district (n=77) units in Nepal.

2.2 | Data collection and processing

148

Based on the previous findings and availability of freely accessible data sources, we collected

149

14 relevant data layers for this assessment covering four broad domains of vulnerability- socio

150

economic inequalities (Mollalo et al. 2020), population dynamics (Wadhera et al. 2020), access

151

to health services (Rader et al. 2020,2020, Smith & Judd 2020, Wadhera et al. 2020) and

152

underlying health condition such as prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, asthma and COPD.

153

Socioeconomic inequalities data

154

Proportion of household with no toilet facility, proportion of households with access to

155

improved water sources, literacy and prevalence of stunting among children were five

156

indicators related with socioeconomic inequalities which were collected as gridded raster layers

157

from demographic and health survey (DHS) 2016 (https://www.dhsprogram.com). These raster

158

surfaces were generated using geostatistical modeling based DHS indicators and several

159

relevant environmental covariates (Mayala et al. 2019). In addition, poverty status raster layer

160

generated using geostatistical method-based household wealth quantile data of DHS and

161

relevant environmental covariates was also retrieved from the worldpop geoportal

162

(https://www.worldpop.org/). Then, mean values of these layers were extracted using the zonal

163

statistics function of the spatial analyst tool of ArcGIS 10.5.

164
165

Demographic and accessibility data

166

Population density and elderly population of age above 60 years; two demographic indicators

167

used in the study were retrieved for the year of 2020 from the worldpop geoportal

168

(https://www.worldpop.org/) in gridded format. The mean value of these layers was

169

summarized in municipal unit using zonal statistics tool of ArcGIS 10.5. To normalize the

170

distribution of population, we took log population density instead of direct population density.

171

Proportion of elderly population were computed by dividing elderly population with total

172

population and expressed in percentage. For the accessibility, we used two indicators;

173

accessibility to urban center and accessibility to health facilities. For urban accessibility, travel

174

time to nearest urban center with population higher than 50,000 were retrieved from Weiss et

175

al. (2018) and extracted in the extent of Nepal while accessibility to health facilities was

176

computed by ourselves. We collected hospital location data from open access Humanitarian

177

Data Exchange Portal (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nepal-health-facilities-cod), landcover

178

map of 2010 from ICIMOD geoportal (Uddin et al. 2015), road from open street map

179

(https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and SRTM DEM from consortium for spatial information

180

geoportal (http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/srtmdata/) for this purpose. We used AccessMod version

181

5.0 (Ray & Ebener 2008) to process these datasets and compute the travel time. Median travel

182

time to nearest health facilities was calculated as a cost distance depending on specific cost

183

values for different land cover properties and considering topographical barriers. The median

184

value of travel time raster and urban accessibility raster were summarized in local unit level

185

using the zonal statistics tools of ArcGIS 10.5.

186

Epidemiological data

187

Reported number of cases for four major non-communicable diseases: hypertension, diabetes,

188

asthma and COPD in Out Patient Department (OPD) services of different hospitals aggregated

189

in municipal unit were downloaded from Health Management Information System (HMIS) web

190

portal (https://dohs.gov.np/ihims-raw-data/) first. Similarly, municipal unit wise population of

191

Nepal was also retrieved from Central Bureau of Statistics (https://cbs.gov.np/population-of-

192

753-local-unit/). Then, both the datasets were linked to 753 municipal units in Arc GIS. Using

2.3 | Vulnerability indices computation

203

As these potential indicators have different scales with different minima and maxima values,

204

in the second step, all indicators were rescaled to a common scale ranging their values from 0

205

with least vulnerable to 100 most vulnerable to make values comparable using the equation (1).

206

During this normalization process the direction of the indicators were also adjusted according

207

to whether the indicator contributes positively or negatively.

respectively.

212

We constructed three vulnerability indices: Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), Epidemiological

213

Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two, the Social-Epidemiological

214

Vulnerability Index (SEVI) following the approach of (Macharia et al. 2020). We chose equally

215

weighted arithmetic mean (Sullivan & Meigh 2006) for overlaying these indicators. However,

216

in a reality, different indicators may affect vulnerability differently, we chose this method due

217

to limited knowledge on relative contribution of these variables on community vulnerability of

218

COVID-19. For the SVI, nine factors representing the socioeconomic inequalities,

219

demographic dynamics and heterogeneity in accessibility were considered while for the EVI,

220

prevalence of four chronic diseases were considered. The actual vulnerability was computed

221

by integrating the both.

222

Finally, all three indices were visualized in ArcGIS environment by grouping them into five

223

levels of risk: very low, low, moderate, high and very high, based on the natural junk

224

classification method (Jenks 1977). The advantage of this classification method is it identifies

225

"natural" groups within the data by reducing the variance within classes and maximizing the

226

variance between classes (Jenks 1977). While many vulnerability assessment approaches

227

provide tabular outputs, visualization is an important part of vulnerability assessment because

228

it allows users to gain a better grasp of the spatial distribution of high or low vulnerability. End-

229

users, and especially those without a technical background, can easily see and interpret the

230

index output in this format compared to other formats (Dickin et al. 2013).

3.1 | Demographic and accessibility inequities

233

Among 753 municipal units of Nepal, municipalities including mega cities like Biratnagar,

234

Bharatpur, Kathmandu, Pokhara, Butwal, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi, etc. have high population

235

density (above 809, up to 63652 individuals per square kilometer), much higher than the

236

average national value (203 per square kilometer) (Fig. 3). Age wise structure of the population

237

reveals that majority of municipal units in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces have higher

238

proportion of elderly population (above 9.4% of the total population aged over 60 years) than

239

rest of the municipalities and rural municipalities. Districts from the highland areas of Province

240

No. 1, Karnali province and Sudoorpashchim province have highest required travel time to the

241

hospital and cities.

Literacy rate is low in Rukum (east) district of Province No 5, sparsely populated some

246

Himalayan districts, and densely populated districts of the Province No. 2 (Fig. 4). Both the

247

poverty and stunting indices are above the national average values in Himalayan areas,

248

especially in Karnali province and Sudoorpashchim province. Drinking water facility is poor

249

in some pocket areas including Rukum (east) district. Coupled with high population density

250

and illiteracy, the Province No. 2 with almost 2/3rd population without the toilet facility has the

3.3 | Disease prevalence inequities

255

Prevalence of the diseases among the population is not uniform among the municipal units of

256

Nepal (Fig. 5). The population in growing cities like Dhulikhel, Tansen etc. have the highest

257

hypertension prevalence (above 200 individuals per 10,000). Asthma is more prevalent (35-57

258

per 10,000 individuals) among the districts of Karnali province (Kalimati, Palata, Kharpunath,

259

Sarkegad Thulibheri, etc. RMs), Sudoorpashchim province (Amargadhi, Ajaymeru,

260

Nawadurga from Dadeldhura district; Jayaprithivi RM from Bajhang; etc.), and some cities

261

like Beshishahar in Lamjung, Dhorpatan in Baglung, etc. The chronic obstructive pulmonary

262

disease (COPD) has higher prevalence among the population of Dhulikhel (121.9 per 10,000),

263

Amargadhi (77 per 10,000), Sarkegadh (65 per 10,000), Tansen (62 per 10,000), Bhimeswor

264

(61 per 10,000), etc. Diabetes is more prevalent in city areas such as Dhulikhel (122.4 per

265

10,000), Tansen, Siddharthnagar, Bharatpur, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Birtamod (50.4 per 10,000),

266

etc.

3.4 | Vulnerability indices to the disease

270

The spatial assemblage of the social vulnerability index (SVI) was heterogeneous across 753

271

municipal units of Nepal (Fig. 6). It revealed that 44 (5.8%) municipal units (six municipalities

272

and 38 rural municipalities) have very high vulnerability, however, population wise, 38.57%

273

(10.7 million) of the total population of Nepal falls under highly vulnerable category (Table 2).

274

Municipal units mainly in highland areas of eastern Nepal from Taplejung, Solukhumbu,

275

Sankhuwasabha etc., from western Nepal such as Rukum, Dailekh, Bajura, Jajarkot, Dolpa etc.

276

and Saptari district of Province No. 2 are among the highly vulnerable. The least vulnerable

277

municipal units (149/753) are mainly located in better developed areas such as Jhapa, Morang,

278

Sunsari, Kathmandu valley, Chitwan, Rupandehi, Dang, Kailali etc. Four metropolitan cities-

279

Biratnagar, Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bharatpur; three sub-metropolitan cities – Dharan, Itahari

280

and Kalaiya; and 66 municiplaities come under the category of very low SVI.

There was no distinct pattern on epidemiological vulnerability index (EVI) among the

285

municipal units of Nepal. The EVI identified nine municipal units as highly vulnerable,

286

however, demographically, 40.15% (11.18 million) of the country population came under this

287

category. Municipal units having high population density with higher prevalence of diseases

288

like asthma, diabtetes, COPD and hypertension such as Dhulikhel, Tansen, Beshishahar,

289

Amarghadhi municipalities fell under the class of very high epidemiological vulnerability

290

index. Among five categories of the EVI, the highest number of municipal units (n= 293) fell

291

under the ‘very low’ but only 6.18% of the total population belonged to this group.

296

The Social-Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI), a composite of the two (SVI and EVI)

297

revealed that 15 municipal units of Nepal are under very high vulnerability of the disease. It

298

included Pokhara Lekhnath metropolitan city, 10 municipalities (Besishahar, Thuli Bheri,

299

Chhayanath Rara, Bhimeshwor, Dhulikhel, Gaur, Dhorpatan, Tansen, Sanphebagar and

300

Amargadhi) and four rural municipalities from Karnali province (Palata, Chankheli,

301

Kharpunath and Sarkegad). The SEVI revealed high vulnerability of 90 municipal units of

302

Nepal including Bharatpur metropolitan city, 28 municipalities more abundantly from Karnali

303

and Sudoorpashchim provinces; and 61 rural municipalities from all over Nepal.

304

Demographically, about 40% (11.15 million) population (0.94% very high vulnerability and

305

39.1% high vulnerability) is highly vulnerable to epidemics. A total of 189 municipal units fall

306

under the category of ‘very low’ SEVI, which include Lalitpur metropolitan city, five sub-

307

metropolitan cities (Dharan, Itahari, Hetauda, Kalaiya and Tulsipur), 70 municipalities and 113

308

rural municipalities.

4 | Discussion

310

The corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and lacks the vaccine

311

and antiviral drug till date (25th June 2020). For containing the disease within the lesser

312

severity, it is important to know the level of vulnerability among the geographical units and the

313

communities such that disease control interventions could be efficiently deployed to the highly

314

vulnerable groups. Here, we present community-level vulnerability index to the epidemics for

315

753 municipal units under 77 districts of 7 provinces in Nepal. The results could be valuable

316

for the local government to effectively control the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19

317

pandemic and other epidemics. Index based vulnerability assessment has been used in a number

318

of diseases including COVID-19 (Dickin et al. 2013, DeCapprio et al. 2020, Macharia et al.

319

2020, KC et al. 2020). The high vulnerability score can be described as a location where a

320

higher percentage of COVID-19 cases would result in severe outcomes such as hospitalization

321

or death as compared to a locality with a low vulnerability score.

322

The social vulnerability index (SVI) varied significantly among the municipalities and rural

323

municipalities of Nepal as a result of a spatial variation of the underlying vulnerability

324

indicators. The SVI identified the municipal units as highly vulnerable ones that have higher

325

population density, greater proportion of the elderly population, larger illiteracy rate and longer

326

travel time to the hospitals and cities. The rate of disease spread increases with human

327

population density and it is consistent for vector borne, air borne as well as contact transmission

328

diseases. Patterns of illness and death due to COVID-19 reflect urban social and economic

329

geographies because poor people living in the high densities with low quality housing seem

330

more affected (Ahmed et al. 2020, Rocklöv & Sjödin 2020, Simon 2020). There is higher

331

probability of interpersonal contact due to overcrowding, difficulties in maintaining the social

332

distance and contact tracing of the victims etc. Greater proportion of the elderly population can

333

be another factor that enhances the severity of the disease in a community. The COVID-19 has

334

been observed to be more fatal to the people of age group above 60 who are already having

335

compromised immunity due to pulmonary or/and cardiovascular disorders (Chau et al. 2014,

336

Fang et al. 2020, Kassir 2020). Therefore, communities with high population density and higher

337

proportion of elderly people are more vulnerable to the epidemics.

338

Inaccessibility factors such as travel time to the cities and hospitals are other important

339

determinants of higher vulnerability to diseases. Lack of access to health care systems due to

340

poverty and need of longer travel time to the health centers greatly compromises the adaptive

341

capacity of communities against epidemics (Olago et al. 2007, Kienberger & Hagenlocher

342

2014). In line to these, our results revealed that municipal units across the entire higher

343

mountain region of Nepal have higher vulnerability. The ability to prevent, detect, and respond

344

to epidemics demand access to rapid and high-quality healthcare. Travel time negatively

345

impacts healthcare-seeking behavior of local inhabitants (Ji et al. 2020, Rader et al. 2020).

346

Rural municipalities across the mountain region are sparsely populated; therefore, chances of

347

human-to-human transmission might be low. However, if the disease spreads, it can have high

348

fatality due to inaccessibility to the health facilities to the illiterate and poor people therein.

349

Densely populated cities across Nepal and the districts of Province No. 2 are highly vulnerable.

350

Higher level of pollution, lack of proper sanitation, illiteracy, overcrowding of people leading

351

to failure in sustaining the interpersonal distance, lower public health related awareness among

352

the people in those areas make the communities highly susceptible to epidemics. Improper

353

waste disposal, unhygienic attitudes, deplorable sanitary conditions, poor knowledge of disease

354

transmission mechanisms, unorthodox beliefs about epidemics, and ignorance on issues of

355

health and healthy living contribute in higher severity of the epidemic (Ndah & Ngoran 2015).

356

All eight districts of Province No 2 have much higher population density than rest of the

357

districts of Nepal and more than half of the households lack toilet facilities.

358

The epidemiological vulnerability index (EVI) revealed that municipalities and rural

359

municipalities that have higher poverty, lack of sanitation and population with higher frequency

360

of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (such as Dhulikhel, Tansen, Beshishahar,

361

Sanphebagar, Amargadhi, etc.) are highly vulnerable to the epidemics. Urbanization and

362

population density are not the sole causes of high COVID-19 infection rate, suburban areas

363

with limited health and sanitation facilities are equally prone to the disease (Miller 2020). The

364

rapidly urbanizing cities often bear fast growing unplanned settlements and lack basic

365

infrastructure (Kienberger & Hagenlocher 2014), hence, suburban areas or growing cities

366

become more vulnerable to epidemics. Among the eight municipal units belonging to the very

367

high vulnerability group on EVI, seven are rapidly urbanizing municipalities (Beshishahar,

368

Thulibheri, Bhimeswor, Dhulikhel, Dhorpatan, Tansen, Sanphebagar and Amargadhi in

369

decreasing order of severity) and one (Sarkegad RM in Humla district) is rural municipality.

370

Further, data revealed that all of those municipal units have very high prevalence of either all

371

or some of the diseases like asthma, diabetes, COPD and hypertension. Elderly people with

372

comorbidities especially those with hypertension, pulmonary disorders, coronary heart disease

373

or diabetes are more likely to be infected and account for a large proportion of deaths from

374

COVID-19 (Fang et al. 2020, Yang et al. 2020, Zheng et al. 2020).

375

The SEVI gave more smoothed results because it is derived as the average of the SVI and EVI.

376

It accounted all the demographic, socioeconomic and public health related indicators and

377

predicted almost 40% of the population under high vulnerability group. The areas identified as

378

the highly vulnerable to the epidemics are densely populated cities or growing cities with under

379

developed infrastructure, higher prevalence of pulmonary and cardio-vascular disorders and

380

inaccessibility to the health facilities. The communities having higher proportion of ethnic

381

minorities living in poverty with low levels of educational attainment have higher rates of

382

hospitalization and death related to COVID-19 than the others (Platt & Warwick 2020,

383

Wadhera et al. 2020). As the SEVI has been obtained by combined processing of demographic,

384

social and epidemiological indicators all together, the vulnerability results could be applicable

385

to other epidemics too.

386

Most of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nepal till date are among the travelers who

387

returned back from abroad including India. Community level transmission has been observed

388

only in a few pocket areas such as Birgunj, Udaypur, Nepalgunj etc. (Tharu et al. 2020). Early

389

isolation of the people by means of the forcefully imposed lockdown, awareness programs and

390

terror of disease among people helped in breaking the transmission chain. However, as the

391

number of cases is increasing exponentially, although limited among the immigrants so far,

392

there is a high risk of community transmission from asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-

393

2. Currently, in the absence of good enough representative cases of COVID-19 community

394

transmission, we couldn’t test efficacies of the computed vulnerability indices. We believe that

395

the vulnerability indices obtained by analyzing the demographic, socioeconomic and

396

epidemiological indicators are valuable tools to the local and state governments for

397

prioritization and improved planning especially in highly vulnerable communities where

398

community level transmission can happen at any moment.

399

The quality of this assessment depends on the accuracy and completeness of the data used here.

400

Specially, we suspect the completeness of epidemiological indicators as this information were

401

derived from the OPD services. In addition, there might be other several factors needed to be

402

considered in the commutation of COVID-19 related vulnerability index. For example, in the

403

absence of organized data, we could not analyze the huge number of populations who are

404

returning from COVID-19 affected countries like India, middle east Asian countries and

405

Malaysia.

406

5 | Conclusions

407

We observed heterogeneity in the distribution of the community vulnerability to epidemics

408

among the 753 municipalities and rural municipalities of Nepal. Most of the municipal units

409

from Province No 2, Karnali and Sudoorpashchim provinces are highly vulnerable to the

410

COVID-19. Additionally, some fast-growing cities with higher prevalence of pulmonary and

411

cardiovascular disorders, lack of proper sanitation are vulnerable to the disease. Longer travel

412

time required to access the health facilities makes the municipal units of mountain region more

413

vulnerable than the rest. Such nature of the vulnerability emphasizes the need to address social

414

determinants of health discrepancies and formulate management programs to deploy the

415

resources efficiently to highly vulnerable communities.
