Abstract

Background: First cases of COVID-19 were reported from Wuhan, China, in December
2019, and it progressed rapidly. On 30 January, WHO declared the new disease as a PHEIC,
then as a Pandemic on 11 March. By mid-March, the virus spread widely; Djibouti was not
spared and was hit by the pandemic with the first case detected on 17 March. Djibouti worked
with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented
a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely
followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case
management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest
per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case,
which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic.
Methods: COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during
the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020.
Results: A total of 1,401 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were included in the study with 4
related deaths (CFR: 0.3%) and an attack rate of 0.15%. Males represented (68.4%) of the
cases, with the age group 31-45 years old (34.2%) as the most affected. Djibouti conducted
17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2
tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced,
which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98%
asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus
was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%).
Conclusion: Djibouti responded to COVID-19 pandemic following an efficient and effective
strategy, using a strong collaboration between civilian and military health assets that increased
the response capacities of the country. Partnership, coordination, solidarity, proactivity and
commitment were the pillars to confront COVID-19 pandemic.
Keywords: Coronavirus, COVID-19, Epidemiology, Pandemic, Djibouti

1. Introduction
Since the first reports of emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan
province, China, in December 2019, the disease has progressed very rapidly (1), declared by
the World Health Organization (WHO) as Public Health Emergency of International Concern
(PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (2), then as a Pandemic on 11 March 2020 (3). COVID-19
spread widely in few weeks and affected around 215 countries, territories and areas around
the globe in the six WHO Regions (4). As of 16 May 2020, 4,525,497 confirmed cases and
307,395 deaths were reported worldwide (4, 5) with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 6.8%.
During the past few months, researchers and the global scientific community found answers
to many questions related to this emerging disease, yet many questions remain unanswered
and require further research and studies.
COVID-19 affected some countries in a more severe course than others (5). As of 16 May
2020, the ten most affected countries with regards to the numbers of cases were the United
States of America with 1,409,452 confirmed cases, Russian Federation with 281,752
confirmed cases, The United Kingdom with 240,165 confirmed cases, Spain with 230,698
confirmed cases, Italy with 224,760 confirmed cases, Brazil with 218,223 confirmed cases,
Germany with 174,355 confirmed cases, Turkey with 148,067 confirmed cases, France with
140,008 confirmed cases, and Iran (Islamic Republic of) with 118,392 confirmed cases (4, 5).
Although Africa is considered as the most vulnerable continent considering the overall
weaker health systems and infrastructure, the African countries were the last ones to be hit by
the pandemic (6). Egypt reported the first case of COVID-19 in the African continent on 14
February 2020 (7, 8), since then, the African countries started to report cases with the first
case reported from the sub-Saharan Africa, in Nigeria, on 27 February 2020 (9). As of 16 May
2020, the African countries reported 77,937 COVID-19 confirmed cases including 2,608
deaths (10), with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.3%.
Djibouti was not spared by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Situated in the horn of
Africa, with a surface area of 23,200 square kilometers (2018) (11) and a population of
962,451 (2018) (12), the country’s biggest asset lies in its strategic position at the southern
entrance to the Red Sea, forming a bridge between Africa and the Middle East (13). The first
case of COVID-19 officially reported in the country was on 17 March 2020 (14). A member
of a foreign military contingent, stationed in Djibouti, who had travelled from his country and
was diagnosed on arrival to Djibouti, luckily with no contact with the local population and
was eventually repatriated back the following day (14).
Since the first case was detected on 17 March up to 16 May 2020, Djibouti reported 1,401
confirmed COVID-19 cases including 4 deaths (15) with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.3%.
Since the beginning of February, even before the first case was reported, Djibouti worked
with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and the
government implemented a series of many intervention measures to prevent and control the
virus circulation in the country; this plan was reviewed and updated in March 2020 (16). The
plan in Djibouti was developed along the WHO recommendations for testing every suspected
case and follow a strict contact tracing method, according to the identified case definition, in

order to limit the number of missed COVID-19 positive cases to the minimum. All positive
cases detected were isolated in the treatment and isolation centers prepared by the Ministry of
Health for this matter (16).
Since March 2020, the government of Djibouti pursued effective and strict policies starting by
the closure of land borders, the port and the airport on 18 March 2020 (17). Many other
measures have been taken by the government including the closure of all schools and
universities on 19 March 2020; the closure of mosques, other places of worship, social
gatherings, bars and night clubs, while the public transportation was limited and non-essential
staff of the government were placed on administrative leave on 22 March 2020. Finally, on 23
March 2020, a general confinement by district was announced and was quickly introduced in
the capital, Djibouti-ville, where almost 70-75% of the population live (18). This confinement
was extended by the government up to 17 May 2020 when the country started gradually the
de-confinement measures (19).
As the emergence of COVID-19 represented a threat to the global health system, it was
important to conduct this study to examine and analyze the epidemiology of the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) in Djibouti, and to explain how successful was the preparedness and
response strategy, followed by the civil and military health authorities and their partners in
Djibouti, during the first two months of the response to the pandemic in the country from 17
March to 16 May 2020.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Strategy pillars
The strategy adopted by the Ministry of Health was and its partners was perfectly in line with
WHO recommendations based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and
contact tracing.
-

Testing

The oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples, as well as, sputum samples were collected
from COVID-19 suspected patients and their contacts by a team of paramedics trained for
sample collecting at the Hospital Bouffard.
The samples were tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) machines
procured by WHO and also through MoH mechanisms. The reagents used were WHO
approved (Sarbecov E-GENE Plus EAV control kits).
-

Isolation and case management

In close collaboration between the civil and military health authorities, a protocol for isolation
and case management was developed and implemented first at hospital Bouffard where nearly
50 beds were dedicated to COVID-19 case management. A second center was opened in Arta
region using the premises of a hospital used by the social security department (16).

Contact Tracing

The Police and Gendarmerie’s medical services were in charge of tracing, quarantining,
testing and isolating all the close contacts of each confirmed case.
2.2. Study population
All coronavirus disease (COVID-19) laboratory-confirmed cases reported officially by the
Ministry of Health of Djibouti during the study period. A case definition for the COVID-19
was identified by the Ministry of Health of Djibouti and it was in line with the WHO case
definition during the period of the study.
2.3. Case definition used for COVID-19 patients and contacts by MoH of Djibouti (16)
Suspected case: 1) a patient with acute respiratory infection (of sudden onset) or at least one
of the following symptoms: cough, fever, shortness of breath AND without an etiology
explaining the clinical presentation AND with a history of traveling or residence in a country/
region reporting local or community transmission during the 14 days prior to the onset of
symptoms; OR 2) a patient with acute respiratory illness AND who has been in close contact
with a confirmed case of COVID-19 during the past 14 days prior to the onset of the
symptoms; OR 3) a patient with severe acute respiratory infection, fever and at least one sign/
symptom of respiratory illness (e.g. cough, fever, shortness of breath) AND requiring
hospitalization (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection - SARI) AND without any etiology that
explains the clinical presentation.
Confirmed case: any person, symptomatic or not, with a lab-confirmed specimen by RT-PCR
for the infection of COVID-19, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2).
Close contact: a person who, during the 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms of a
confirmed case, shared the same living space (e.g. family, roommate) or had direct face-toface contact within 1 meter or less of the case and/ or for more than 15 minutes, in a
discussion; close friends; class or office mates; close to a case in a transport for an extended
period of time; a person providing care of a confirmed case or laboratory personnel handling
specimens of a confirmed case, in the absence of adequate equipment of protection.
2.4. Study duration
Data of COVID-19 patients reported by the Ministry of Health of Djibouti for two months
were collected and included in the study. Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in
Djibouti on 17 March 2020 up to 16 May 2020.
2.5. Data source
All COVID-19 data used in this study was collected through the epidemiological surveillance
system of the Ministry of Health of Djibouti and retrieved through the daily communiqué
developed and published by the Ministry of Health of Djibouti (15), as well as, the daily
situation report developed by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO Country
Office.

2.6. Laboratory methods
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Health of Djibouti identified
the laboratory of Hospital Bouffard, situated in the capital, Djibouti-ville, as the only
laboratory of reference for the testing and confirmation of COVID-19 cases in the country.
Military and civilian laboratory technicians worked together under the supervision of a
medical biology specialist from the private sector contracted by the MoH.
The swabs, were collected from the COVID-19 suspected patients and from the contacts of
COVID-19 positive cases, during the contact tracing procedure, to get tested by RT-PCR
following the WHO guidelines for laboratory confirmation of the emerging disease during the
study period (20).
2.7. Data management
The collected COVID-19 data from Djibouti was revised, tabulated and entered into a PC
Excel file (Microsoft Office). Data cleaning and quality checking were performed. The
epidemiological and demographic characteristics were summarized in this study. A P-value
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Further data analysis was conducted by
epidemiological week against the number of COVID-19 positive cases over the study period
to show the coronavirus disease peak in the country, as well as, the positivity rate. R naught
(R0) was calculated per week and for the whole period of the study.
2.8. Ethical approval
This study was conducted using publicly anonymous online available data published by the
Ministry of Health of Djibouti; therefore, no ethical approval was needed.

3. Results
From 17 March to 16 May 2020, 1,401 positive COVID-19 cases were reported by the
Ministry of Health in Djibouti including 4 deaths with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.3% and
an attack rate of 0.15%. Twenty-eight cases were primary cases and the rest were contacts of
positive cases that were found positive during the aggressive and proactive contact tracing
exercise. The peak of COVID-19 pandemic in Djibouti started during the first week of April
2020 and the number of cases started to decline during the third week of the same month
(Figure 1).
The period of this study resides between the epidemiological week number 12 (15-21 March
2020) and the epidemiological week number 20 (10-16 May 2020) (21). (Figure 2) shows that
the Ministry of Health of Djibouti performed 17,532 tests for COVID-19 during the study
period with the epi week 16 (12-18 April 2020) having the highest number of performed tests,
3,693 tests, and also with the highest number of detected positive cases, 631 positive cases
detected, with a positivity rate of 17%. The positivity rates since the beginning of the
pandemic in Djibouti up to end of epi week 20 varied from 1% in epi week 12 up to 17% in
epi week 16, with an overall positivity rate of 8%.

The demographic characteristics of COVID-19 cases during the study period in Djibouti
shows that male gender dominated the reported cases by 68.4% (958) of the lab-confirmed
cases in the country. During the study period, the highest age group affected by the emerging
zoonotic virus was the age group 31-45 years old with 34.2% (479) of the cases followed by
the age group 16-30 years old with 33.3% (466) of the cases (Table 1).

The response strategy, based on the four pillars, followed by the Ministry of Health of
Djibouti during the study period, along with the treatment protocol agreed upon in the
National Action Plan for preparedness and response for COVID -19 (16) showed efficient
results during the first two months of the response. This was reflected through a significantly
low CFR (0.3%) which was at least 20 times lower that the global CFR reported during the
study period (global CFR up to 16 May was 6.8%), as well as, through the high percentage of
recoveries reaching 69% (972) of the infected cases in the country. (Figure 3) shows the high
number of recovered COVID-19 patients during the study period per week with the highest
number of recoveries, 365 recoveries, during the epi week 17.
The figure also shows the progression of the basic reproduction number or the R naught (R0),
which is an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness or transmissibility of
infectious agents, by week. The highest reported R0 during the study period was during the
epi week 13 (22-28 March 2020) with a value of 18. The weekly R naught varied during the
study period from 0.3 to 18, with an overall R naught of 0.91 during the 9 weeks of the study.
Primary COVID-19 cases in Djibouti represented 2% (28) of the reported cases in the country
during the study period. Secondary cases and contacts of the contacts represented 98% (1373)
of the cases (Figure 4). The low percentage of primary cases in Djibouti is explained by the
closure of the land borders, port and airport on 18 March 2020. Therefore, no primary cases
have been reported in the country after week 15 (5-11 April 2020).
COVID-19 pandemic was reported in 4 out of 6 regions in the Republic of Djibouti. The
affected regions were respectively: Djibouti-ville (the capital) with 83% of the reported cases,
Ali Sabieh with 10% of the cases, Arta with 6% of the cases and Dikhil with only 1% of the
cases reported during the study period (Figure 5).

4. Discussion
This is a descriptive study of the epidemiology of COVID-19 cases reported in Djibouti
during the first two months of the detection of the virus in the country. It explains the
response strategy put and adopted by the Ministry of Health of Djibouti together with its
civilian and military partners during the same period, in close collaboration with WHO
country office, which was followed strictly during the period of confinement announced by
the government in the country between 23 March and 16 May 2020 (18).
The study findings show that the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Djibouti started in
the first week of April 2020 (epi week 15) and the number of cases started to decline during
the third week of the month (epi week 18). Epi week 16 represented the top of the curve in
Djibouti with 3,693 performed tests and with 631 positive cases detected, with a positivity
rate of 17%. This is explained by the rise of the laboratory capacity to perform more tests per
day, the detection of two clusters of COVID-19 in two hospitals during this period, one
hospital in Djibouti-ville and the second in Ali Sabieh region (22), simultaneously with the
start of the community transmission of the virus in the country.
The results of gender differences in the patients of COVID-19 in Djibouti are conforming
with the results in other studies conducted in different countries and regions showing that the
number of male patients affected by COVID-19 is almost the double of female patients (23,
24). Djibouti has a young population with a median age of 20 years old, and with 86.5%
(832,067) of the population less than 49 years old according to the latest Djibouti Statistical
Yearbook 2019 (12). This explains the high percentage of COVID-19 cases in the country,
73.2% (1025), below the age of 46 years old.
Djibouti showed a high percentage of recoveries among COVID-19 infected patients, 69%
(972), during the study period. This was explained by the strict strategy of testing every
suspected case of COVID-19 and contact tracing for all contacts. The patients were isolated at
a very early stage of the infection, most of them asymptomatic, and treated according to the
protocol agreed upon by the case management committee in the country. According to the
case management protocol, Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were introduced to all
isolated patients, since day 1 of isolation up to they tested negative, with two consecutive
swabs, with at least a period of 48 hours between the tests (16).
The mortality rate in Djibouti was one of the lowest in the region and globally, only 4 deaths
(CFR: 0.3%). Deaths were elderly patients who were already in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
even before being infected with COVID-19. They were recorded during the epi weeks: 15
(two deaths), 19 and 20 consecutively. Most of the cases of COVID-19 in Djibouti were
contacts, 98% (1373), due to the strict interventions and decisions taken by the government of
Djibouti of closing the airport, port and land borders, on 18 March 2020, just the following
day of the detection of the first case in the country.

Djibouti-ville, the capital, was the most affected region in the country with COVID-19 cases,
83% (1157). This is due to the residence of more than 70-75% of the population in the capital
according to the latest Djibouti Statistical Yearbook 2019 (12). Ali Sabieh comes as second
region, with 10% (143), due to the outbreak of COVID-19 that was reported at the regional
hospital in April 2020 (22).
It is important to mention that during the study period, according to the data from the Ministry
of Health (MoH), 95-98% of the reported COVID-19 cases were completely asymptomatic
and mainly detected through the contact tracing procedure. Therefore, only 2-5% of the cases
has symptoms, mainly with very mild symptoms; therefore, it was not significant to register
the clinical features of the patients of the newly emerging disease by the MoH, during the
study period, in the country.
The strategy of response to the COVID-19 pandemic adopted by the government of Djibouti
since the detection of the first case in the country up to the last day of the confinement, 16
May 2020, was based on four main pillars. These pillars were: 1) Testing every single
COVID-19 suspected case according to the case definition, by taking the needed swabs for the
PCR test; 2) Isolating all detected positive cases in a center of isolation prepared specifically
for this reason by the government in Arta region; 3) Starting an early case management for all
positive cases before even the development of symptoms; and 4) Conducting a strict contact
tracing procedure for all contacts of the positive cases, testing them, and isolating those who
were tested positive (Figure 6).
This strategy permitted to protect Djibouti from having severe or critical cases of COVID-19
during the first two months of the circulation of the virus in the country. An objective that was
targeted since the first day of the development of the preparedness and response plan due to
the limited Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacities in the country, as well as, the shortage in the
human resources working for ICU.
Regarding the laboratory, Djibouti built its laboratory capacity for detection and confirmation
of COVID-19 cases using the PCR machine in a very short and limited time, almost less than
one week. The country started by the capacity for testing 100 samples per day and reached the
capacity of testing up to 2,000 samples per day in the first week of April 2020. The
government designated the laboratory of Hospital Bouffard, in the capital, as the only
reference laboratory for the testing of COVID-19 cases.
During the study period, Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests for suspected COVID-19 cases as
well as, the contacts detected through the contact tracing procedure, and the country was
considered as a champion for COVID-19 tests in the African continent with the highest
number of conducted tests per capita, 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant (17,532/ 962,451), up to 16
May 2020, considered higher than the triple of the average testing rates in the continent
during the study period (25).
The early preparedness for the newly emerging disease; the transparency; the interventions
taken by and the commitment of the government of Djibouti to save the lives of their people;
lead to an adequate and an ideal response to the pandemic in the country. A close
collaboration between MoH, WHO and other health sector partners during the preparation of

the National Action Plan for preparedness and response to the COVID-19 in Djibouti,
developed as a first draft in February 2020, reviewed and updated in March 2020; had its
efficient and effective results during the response.
The preparedness and response plan for Djibouti was conforming with the WHO guidelines
for surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection (20) published for the first time on
21 January 2020, with the latest update published on 10 May 2020. The response of the
country was distinguished and a model among the countries at the horn of Africa, the WHO
Eastern Mediterranean Region, and globally. It was also highly appreciated on the regional
and global levels in many occasions (26).
The Ministry of Health of Djibouti understands that the coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) is
still circulating in the country. Therefore, with the de-confinement started on 17 May 2020, a
risk communication campaign was planned to sensitize the population to follow the barrier
measures necessary to prevent a higher spread of the infection among the population. These
measures include: 1) Frequent washing of hand with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand
rub; 2) Preserving the physical distancing with others, either at home, at work or at any public
place; and 3) Coughing or sneezing into a bended arm, or using a disposable tissue.
This campaign and other measures taken by the government of Djibouti will help the country
to confront the disease. The vigilance of the MoH and the technical, operational and logistical
support from WHO and other partners involved in the health sector in the country are the
pillars to mitigate the harmful effects of the pandemic on the Djiboutian population.

5. Conclusion
Djibouti spent tremendous efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the most adequate
and efficient way, using the comparative advantages and harnessing the collaboration and
collegiality between civilian and military health authorities that coordinated through the
highest authorities in the country. The study described the epidemiological characteristics of
the COVID-19 cases reported in the country and explained the response strategy followed by
MoH and its partners. Conducting more studies is mandatory to deepen the understanding of
the epidemiology of COVID-19, specifically, the clinical features of the emerging disease in
the countries of the horn of Africa.
It is important to acknowledge that partnership, coordination, solidarity, vigilance, proactivity
