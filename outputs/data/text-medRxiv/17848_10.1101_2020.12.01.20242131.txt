ABSTRACT:

15

Wastewater-based epidemiology is an emerging tool to monitor COVID-19 infection

16

levels by measuring the concentration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

17

(SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater. There remains a need to improve wastewater RNA

18

extraction methods’ sensitivity, speed, and reduce reliance on often expensive commercial

19

reagents to make wastewater-based epidemiology more accessible. We present a kit-free

20

wastewater RNA extraction method, titled “Sewage, Salt, Silica and SARS-CoV-2” (4S), that

21

employs the abundant and affordable reagents sodium chloride (NaCl), ethanol and silica RNA

22

capture matrices to recover 6-fold more SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater than an existing

ultrafiltration-based method. The 4S method concurrently recovered pepper mild mottle virus

24

(PMMoV) and human 18S ribosomal subunit rRNA, both suitable as fecal concentration

25

controls. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in three sewersheds corresponded to

26

the relative prevalence of COVID-19 infection determined via clinical testing. Lastly, controlled

27

experiments indicate that the 4S method prevented RNA degradation during storage of

28

wastewater samples, was compatible with heat pasteurization, and could be performed in

29

approximately 3 hours. Overall, the 4S method is promising for effective, economical, and

30

accessible wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2, providing another tool to fight the

31

global pandemic.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) enables the indirect assessment of viral infection

39

prevalence in populations.1–3 The quantity of viral nucleic acids shed into wastewater by infected

40

individuals, whether symptomatic or not, serves as a proxy for the relative prevalence of

41

infection.1 WBE can provide population-level infection information for up to many thousands of

42

individuals in a community to complement individual-level testing and aid public health decision

43

making.4

44

WBE is now being applied to monitor and even predict population-level coronavirus disease

45

2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks.1,5 Local COVID-19 prevalence is difficult to assess due to

46

insufficient individual testing capacity, rendering effective response more challenging.6

47

Wastewater can provide insights into COVID-19 prevalence, as COVID-19 patients shed SARS-

48

CoV-2 RNA in their stool and thus into wastewater.7,8 Emerging studies report wastewater

49

SARS-CoV-2 concentrations that correspond to reported clinical prevalence of COVID-19, with

50

potential for early detection of COVID-19 outbreaks and identification of newly emerging

51

SARS-CoV-2 variants.9–12 To extract and quantify the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shed

52

into wastewater, researchers are using size- and charge-based concentration methods that

53

concentrate intact SARS-CoV-2 virus prior to RNA extraction.13–15 These methods employ a

54

primary concentration step via sieving by particle size, enmeshment of viral particles in

55

precipitates that can be separated by mass, or adsorption via electrostatic interactions, prior to

56

RNA extraction.15 These methods are relatively time-consuming and inaccessible as they are

57

dependent on reliable supply of commercial reagents, a paucity of which has already hampered

58

clinical SARS-CoV-2 testing efforts.13–16 Further, the use of primary concentration assumes the

59

recovery of intact virus, and is therefore not geared towards co-capturing RNA from SARS-

60

CoV-2 viruses that have already lysed or capture of non-viral RNAs suitable as fecal

61

concentration controls.14 Lastly, current CDC safety guidelines recommend BSL-3 precautions

62

when employing environmental sampling procedures that concentrate viruses presumed to be

63

intact.17 To mitigate concerns of concentrating potentially infectious virus, heat-based

64

wastewater sample pasteurization and subsequent extraction could allow for easier and safer

65

wastewater processing after collection.

66

We aimed to develop an economical, kit-free method for the direct capture (extraction) of

67

SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater. The method employs lysis of biological particles via

68

sodium chloride (NaCl), heat-based pasteurization, coarse filtration, ethanol precipitation, and

69

RNA capture via silica-based columns (4S-column) or silicon dioxide slurry (4S-Milk-of-Silica).

70

This approach allows recovery of wastewater RNA without mass, size, or charge bias and the co-

71

capture of RNA from lysed SARS-CoV-2 virus alongside RNA from other biological particles in

72

wastewater that are suitable as fecal concentration controls, such as pepper mild mottle virus

73

(present in dietary peppers and shed in feces) and human 18S ribosomal RNA.18 The 4S method

74

stabilizes the nucleic acids in wastewater via the addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) and

75

ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and is compatible with heat pasteurization, which

76

makes wastewater samples safer to process. The 4S method’s omission of a primary

77

concentration step and kit-free extraction enables lower reliance on commercial reagents and

78

speeds up RNA purification to enable same-day measurement of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater

79

abundance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

84

Sample collection

85

For this study, we obtained composite 24-hour wastewater influent samples from East Bay

86

Municipal Utility District’s wastewater treatment plant. These samples represent three discrete

87

sampling areas: North and west Berkeley, El Cerrito, Kensington and Albany (sub-sewershed

88

“N”), Oakland/Piedmont (sub-sewershed “S”), and Berkeley/Oakland Hills (sub-sewershed “A”)

89

(interceptor coverage detailed in Fig. S2A). Samples were kept at 4C on ice during transport

90

and processed within 24 hours or kept at -80C and processed within two weeks.

91

Wastewater RNA extraction

92

Wastewater RNA extraction via the 4S-column and 4S-Milk-of-Silica methods is detailed in

93

depth at https://www.protocols.io/view/v-4-direct-wastewater-rna-capture-and-purification-

94

bpdfmi3n and dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.biwfkfbn.28,29. In brief, for 4S RNA extraction

95

using a silica column, samples were lysed via the addition of Sodium Chloride (NaCl) to a final

96

concentration of 4 M and EDTA to a final concentration of 1 mM and buffered via the addition

97

of 10 mM pH 7.2 tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. Samples were heat inactivated in a water

98

bath (unless indicated otherwise) at 70C for 45 minutes, filtered using a 5-M DuraPore PVDF

99

filter membrane (Millipore Sigma) and syringe filter. Ethanol was added to sample filtrate to a

100

final concentration of 35%. Samples were passed through Zymo-IIIP silica columns (Zymo

101

Research) using a vacuum manifold. For all experiments other than the wash buffer tests (Figure

102

4, Supplemental Figure S4), samples were washed with 25 mL of high NaCl (1.5M) and ethanol

103

(20%) containing wash buffer #1 (4S-WB1), and 50 mL of low NaCl (100mM) and ethanol

104

(80%) containing wash buffer #2 (4S-WB2). Washed RNA was eluted from silica columns using

105

200 L of ZymoPURE elution buffer (Zymo Research) or pH 8 Tris-EDTA buffer pre-heated to

106

50C.

107

For 4S-Milk-of-Silica extraction, samples were lysed, heat inactivated and filtered as in the 4S-

108

column extraction. Next, a 1 g/mL silicon dioxide slurry in water was added to the filtered lysate

109

and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The lysate and silica slurry were centrifuged

110

at 4000 x g for 5 minutes, pelleting wastewater RNA bound to silica particulate. The lysate

111

supernatant was decanted, and the silica pellet was washed with 40 mL 4S-WB1 and 40 mL of

112

4S-WB2 via centrifugation and wash buffer decanting. The washed silica pellet was resuspended

113

in 20 mL of pure water pre-heated to 37°C to elute bound RNA. Next, the silicon dioxide

114

particulate was pelleted via centrifugation and the eluted RNA was separated and concentrated

115

via isopropanol precipitation, as previously described.30,29 4S-column and 4S-Milk-of-Silica

116

reagent costs are listed in Supplementary Table 6.

117

For sample RNA concentration via ultrafiltration, Amicon 100-kDa ultrafilters (Millipore Sigma)

118

were pretreated to block virus adsorption using 2 mL bovine serum albumen 1% (w/v) in 1x PBS

119

and then washed with PBS. Wastewater samples were divided into 40 mL aliquots and solids

120

were removed via slow centrifugation with a swinging bucket rotor at 4700 x g for 30 min.

121

Supernatant was decanted and passed through a 0.2 µm flat membrane filter (Steriflip, EMD

122

Millipore). Filtrate was loaded onto the ultrafilter in increments of up to 15 mL and ultrafilters

123

were spun for 10 minutes at 4700 xg for each increment. Flow-through was discarded and

124

samples were concentrated until they were reduced to a final volume of ~250 µl. RNA was

125

extracted from the ultrafiltration concentrate using an AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN)

126

following manufacturer instructions.

virus (PMMoV) coat protein gene assay, bovine coronavirus transmembrane protein gene assay

130

and a newly developed human 18S ribosomal rRNA assay. (Supporting information, Table S3.)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

138

Many current methods of wastewater viral RNA extraction assume that most viral

139

particles within wastewater are intact and that the concentration of these intact viruses prior to

140

extraction is necessary to achieve sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Given this

141

assumption, these methods typically employ precipitation-, charge-, or size-based viral

142

concentration and subsequent RNA extraction of unpasteurized wastewater to preserve viruses in

143

an intact state.14,15 Despite concentration, some methods were shown to recover as little as 0-1%

144

of SARS-CoV-1 from wastewater during the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic.19 We hypothesized that

145

direct extraction could avoid loss of virus during the primary concentration step, and we

146

therefore designed the 4S (Sewage, Salt, Silica and SARS-CoV-2) method to lyse viruses and

147

microorganisms present in wastewater using sodium chloride and subsequently capture the free

148

RNA using a silica RNA binding matrix.

149

To benchmark the performance of the 4S method, we analyzed a 24-hour composite

150

wastewater sample treated with and without heat pasteurization and compared the recovery of

151

endogenous SARS-CoV-2 to that of an ultrafiltration-based method. In addition, we compared

152

the recovery of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) RNA, which may be useful to

153

control for variable fecal concentrations in wastewater, and a spiked-in bovine coronavirus

154

vaccine (bCoV), used as an RNA extraction process control (Figure 1). We observed that the

155

4S-column method recovered 6-fold more SARS-CoV-2 RNA than ultrafiltration (Figure 1).

157

Surprisingly, SARS-CoV-2 recovery by the 4S method was not impacted by heat

158

pasteurization, suggesting that further SARS-CoV-2 virus lysis did not occur. This result may

159

imply that a large fraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not bound to virus particles; this unbound

160

RNA was captured by the 4S method but was not efficiently concentrated by ultrafiltration.

161

The 4S-column method without heat pasteurization also recovered 6-fold more bCoV

162

than ultrafiltration, and 28-fold more bCoV with heat pasteurization. In this case, heat

163

pasteurization may promote additional lysis of encapsidated bCoV, releasing its RNA for

164

subsequent capture. Recovery of PMMoV by 4S was also higher with heat pasteurization (2-fold

165

increase in recovery), but ultrafiltration was more effective in enriching PMMoV (1.6-fold

166

higher than using the 4S-column method with heat pasteurization). Here, ultrafiltration may be

167

effective in concentrating intact virus that is able to persist in wastewater, which is consistent

168

with previous reports on PMMoV.18,20 Collectively, these results suggest that a significant

169

fraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the analyzed wastewater was not bound to viral particles but

170

was present as free or ribonucleoprotein-bound RNA. This possibility is consistent with reports

171

indicating reduced viability of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses spiked into

172

wastewater.13,21

173

Given that the 4S method is designed to lyse and extract wastewater RNAs without

174

requiring the enrichment of viral particles, we also investigated whether the 4S method could

175

recover human RNAs present in wastewater. Using the 4S method, we were able to recover and

176

detect human ribosomal subunit RNA (18S rRNA) in wastewater influent (Supplementary Figure

177

S1A). 18S rRNA recovery was enhanced 2.5-fold by heat pasteurization, suggesting the lysis of

178

human cells or 18S rRNA bound to ribonucleoprotein complexes present in wastewater

179

(Supplementary Figure S1A). Therefore, the 4S method enabled the recovery and detection of

180

human RNA, another potential indicator of wastewater fecal concentration, which could allow

181

direct normalization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantity to human RNA content of wastewater. As

182

heat pasteurization did not affect 4S recovery of SARS-CoV-2 and improved the recovery of

183

PMMoV, bCoV and 18S rRNA, we recommend integrating this pathogen inactivation step to

184

increase the safety of processing wastewater samples.

185

We sought to adapt the 4S strategy to employ silica powder for RNA capture rather than

186

silica columns to circumvent reliance on commercially manufactured silica columns. In this

187

approach, we added a slurry of silicon dioxide particles to lysed wastewater and used

188

centrifugation to separate particle-bound RNA from the wastewater matrix, an approach we

189

named “4S-Milk-of-Silica”. We observed that the 4S-Milk-of-Silica method recovered

190

equivalent SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV signal to the 4S method using a silica column

191

(Supplementary Figure S1B). Thus, the 4S-Milk-of-Silica method presents an even more cost-

192

effective (~$8 per sample, vs. ~$13 per sample, using the 4S-column extraction method,

193

Supplementary Table 6) and accessible method to extract wastewater RNA without reliance on

194

commercially manufactured silica columns and a vacuum manifold. However, the “Milk of

195

Silica” version of the 4S protocol requires an isopropanol precipitation RNA concentration step,

196

lengthening the protocol time. Therefore, we recommend using the 4S-column method to enable

197

faster sample processing, while “4S-Milk-of-Silica” presents an alternate protocol for use in

198

resource-limited settings.

199

WBE can provide an assessment of different areas’ relative COVID-19 infection

200

prevalence, so we assessed whether the 4S-column extraction method could detect differential

201

SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in wastewaters derived from different subsections of a collection

202

system. We surveyed three wastewater influent interceptors serving North and West Berkeley

203

and El Cerrito (N), East Berkeley/Berkeley Hills (A) and Oakland (S) (Interceptor area coverage

204

shown in Supplementary Figure S2A). These interceptors served areas exhibiting differential

205

incidence of clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases, ranging from three (A interceptor) to 68 (S

206

interceptor) reported cases per day within the week of our sampling (Figure S2A). To compare

207

clinical COVID-19 case data and wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentration, we normalized the

208

case data by population, and we normalized the SARS-CoV-2 quantity by PMMoV abundance,

209

to control for fecal concentration in the wastewater. Raw SARS-CoV2 and PMMoV abundance

210

is available in Supplementary Figure 2B. As expected, the normalized wastewater SARS-CoV-2

211

signals trended with the per capita clinical cases per day in the three sub-sewersheds (Figure 2,

212

B). The normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration was highest in wastewater representing

213

the S interceptor area, where the highest daily per capita new cases also occurred. Normalized

214

SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewaters representing the N interceptor area were only

215

2.3-fold lower than those of S interceptor wastewaters, despite 11.6-fold fewer per capita daily

216

cases being reported in the A interceptor area during the week of our sample collection. One

217

possible reason for this difference could be the presence of undiagnosed infections in the N

218

interceptor service area, in which case wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations may

219

provide a more accurate view of the relative COVID-19 infection prevalence in the week prior to

220

sampling. Alternatively, the variability associated with wastewater measurements may be too

221

large to detect differences of this magnitude.9,13 Ongoing research seeks to better quantify the

222

measurement variability in wastewater samples over temporal and spatial scales. We emphasize

223

that SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were quantifiable in the A sub-sewershed despite only 18 cases

224

being reported in an estimated population of 90,000 during the weeklong period of our sampling.

Wastewater contains many contaminants with the potential to degrade nucleic acids, and

228

it has been previously observed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater is degraded during

229

storage.22–24 Viral detection relying on wastewater RNA extraction methods that concentrate

230

intact viruses may be strongly affected by variable amounts of virus and viral RNA degradation

231

in wastewater. Therefore, we sought to assess whether EDTA and sodium chloride, added to

232

wastewater in the 4S method to promote lysis, could dually act to preserve RNA in wastewater.

233

Upon receipt of each wastewater sample, we added NaCl to a final concentration of 4 M, added

234

EDTA to a final concentration of 1 mM, and stored the samples either at 4°C for a month, or

235

three days at room temperature (20°C). We observed that salt and EDTA addition prior to

236

storage improved SARS-CoV-2 N1 assay signal after storage at both 4°C for one month (2.6-

237

fold higher signal when stored with salt and EDTA) or at 20°C for three days (22-fold higher

238

signal when stored with salt and EDTA) (Figure 3). Interestingly, the PMMoV assay signal

239

remained similar throughout storage with or without salt, implying that PMMoV remains

240

resistant to RNAses in the wastewater matrix. This observation corroborates previous reports

241

indicating the persistence of PMMoV in wastewater.18,20 As with SARS-CoV-2 N1 signal, we

observed that salt and EDTA addition preserved human 18S rRNA signal at 4°C for one month

243

(126-fold higher) or at 20°C for three days (56-fold higher) (Figure 3). These results again

244

support the conclusion that much of the SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is not bound by intact

245

capsid, rendering it more susceptible to degradation, unlike PMMoV which may remain

246

encapsidated to protect it from degradation. Overall, the lysis salts added to wastewater as part of

247

the normal 4S method workflow conveniently preserved wastewater RNAs and may mitigate

248

degradation-mediated variation in SARS-CoV-2 and fecal concentration controls caused by RNA

249

degradation during shipping and storage.

250

Given the impact of RNA degradation on SARS-CoV-2 N1 assay signal, we investigated

251

whether bulk RNA yield, representing intact wastewater RNA, could be employed as a

252

normalization measure for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Surprisingly, bulk RNA yield per mL of

253

wastewater input correlated poorly with SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV detection (Supplementary

254

Figure 3A). These results imply that most bulk wastewater RNA may be contributed by

255

wastewater microorganisms unrelated to human fecal content or viral content, thus weakly

256

correlating to SARS-CoV-2 N1 assay signal. We also observed that extracting nucleic acids from

257

increasing volumes of wastewater (up to 400 mL) did not strongly increase total RNA yield per

258

extraction past 100 mL of wastewater sample input, implying potential saturation of the RNA

259

capture matrix (Supplementary Figure S3B). From these experiments, we conclude that the RT-

260

qPCR detection of human fecal concentration indicators such as PMMoV and human 18S rRNA,

261

the latter of which is preserved during storage similarly to SARS-CoV-2, are better estimators of

262

wastewater fecal concentration than bulk RNA quantity measurements. Lastly, we observed that

263

the 4S method enriched up to 8 µg of DNA per 100 mL of wastewater, suggesting that the 4S

264

method could be employed for future wastewater surveillance of DNA-based pathogens and NA-

265

sequencing based wastewater surveys (Supplementary Figure S3C).

267

Wastewater samples contain many contaminants that have previously been reported to

268

inhibit RT-qPCR reactions.25 Therefore, we sought to assess whether the 4S method could

269

generate purified RNA free of RT-qPCR contaminants by employing the “spike and dilute”

270

method to assess PCR inhibition.26 Here, we spiked purified wastewater RNA with synthetic

271

RNA standard and sequentially diluted the sample and observed whether SARS-CoV-2 N1,

272

PMMoV, and bCoV detection followed corresponding sample dilutions, indicating an absence of

273

inhibition. We assessed the impact of a range (1-50 mL) of wash buffer volumes during RNA

274

extraction on PCR inhibition and SARS-CoV-2 N1, PMMoV, and bCoV assay signal to identify

and 4S-Wash buffer #2 (volumes reported at top of each panel). Sample dilutions shown are
1x, 5x, 10x, and 20x. Green line with circular points represents theoretically expected
increase in Ct due to sample dilution, blue line with triangular points indicates actual increase
in Ct with sample dilution. The green band indicates +/- 1 Ct tolerance range around the
expected Ct values, due to variability. An increase in measured Ct that is lower than the
expected increase was interpreted as inhibition. RNA sample dilution factor is indicated on xaxis.

275

the optimal wash buffer volume for RNA purity and recovery. There was no evidence of

276

inhibition for the SARS-CoV-2 N1 assay using the 4S procedure with any wash buffer volume,

277

and slight inhibition of the PMMoV assay when using 5 mL of 4S-Wash buffer #1 (4S-WB1)

278

and 10 mL of 4S-Wash buffer #2 (4S-WB2) (Figure 4). To limit ethanol waste generation, we

279

therefore recommend using at least 7 mL of 4S-WB1 and 14 mL of 4S-WB2 to yield inhibitor-

280

free RNA.

281

Next, we assessed potential assay signal loss due to excess washing of the silica columns.

282

Here, we observed highest SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV and bCoV assay signal using 3 mL of 4S-

283

WB1 and 6mL of Wash 4S-WB2, with minimal losses in signal up until 25 mL of 4S-WB1 and

284

50 mL of 4S-WB2 (Supplementary Figure S4). Using too little wash buffer may not sufficiently

285

wash away lysis salts and contaminants from the silica matrix, reducing RNA recovery and

286

increasing inhibition, whereas too much wash buffer may partially elute bound RNA, decreasing

287

RNA yield. Therefore, we recommend using 7-10 mL of 4S-WB1 and 14-20 mL of 4S-WB2 to

288

extract PCR inhibitor-free RNA while maximizing target RNA recovery.

289

The results presented here are representative of only three wastewater sources which may

290

differ in composition from wastewater collected at other times and from other locations.

291

Different wastewaters may contain different types and quantities of PCR inhibitors, so we

292

recommend assessing PCR inhibition in all sample types, and if necessary, adjusting the wash

293

buffer volumes to effectively remove inhibitors from the purified RNA. Different wastewater

294

samples may also contain varying biological and chemical species influencing RNA stability,

295

potentially impacting the RNA preservation documented here by the 4S method. Furthermore,

296

the 4S method may be less effective in capturing the nucleic acids from wastewater viruses or

297

other microorganisms resistant to the sodium chloride and heat-based lysis evaluated here.

298

Overall, we demonstrate that the 4S method enabled efficient extraction of SARS-CoV-2,

299

PMMoV, bCoV, and human 18S rRNA. Combined with RT-qPCR, the 4S method allowed

300

monitoring of relative COVID-19 infection prevalence with high sensitivity. These results are

301

consistent with those of a recent inter-laboratory comparison of 36 different wastewater SARS-

302

CoV-2 RNA detection methods. In this comparison, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2

303

measured with the 4S method, identified as “1S.2H”, was one of the highest reported (direct

304

measurement, without correcting for recovery efficiency) and the recovery efficiency of a

305

spiked-in OC43 virus efficiency control was the highest reported, among all methods.27 The 4S

306

method also preserved RNA in wastewater, was compatible with heat pasteurization, and yielded

307

purified RNA free of PCR inhibitors. Given the high efficiency, low cost, and same-day

308

assessment of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 and fecal concentration controls, the 4S method presents

309

an affordable and accessible method for implementing wastewater-based epidemiology for

310

SARS-CoV-2. The method also appears promising for the application of WBE for other RNA-

311

and DNA-based pathogens and facilitating research on the wastewater microbial community

312

more broadly.
