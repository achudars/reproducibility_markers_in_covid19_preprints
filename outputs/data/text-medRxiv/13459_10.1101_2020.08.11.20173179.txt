Abstract:

28

Coronavirus (SARS Covid-19) has become a global public health concern due to its

29

unpredictable nature and lack of adequate pre-existing conditions. Achievement of WASH

30

services is being acknowledged as indispensable in safeguarding health. However, on a global

31

scale, it is currently not clear whether deprivation or non-obtainability of which of the factors are

32

closely related to Covid-19 dynamics and up to which degree. We have analysed 6 months’ data

33

related to five Covid-19 indicators for most of the countries in the world with three groups of

34

indicators of WASH, socio-economic factors and mobility & stringency. Four successive steps

35

were followed to carry out the analysis: (a) identification of relevant key explanatory variables of

36

Covid-19, (b) identification of indicators (n=103) for other 5 sub-groups of factors (viz. WASH,

37

economy, health, society, mobility & stringency) through literature review, (c) utilizing

38

Spearman’s rank-order correlation for measuring the association of the possible explanatory

39

variables with those of Covid-19 (of spatial nature), and then (d) continuing the same for 6

40

consecutive months (from March to August 2020) until we get an almost unchanging trend. We

41

have found a strong positive correlation between lesser effects (i.e. either less confirmed case or

42

higher recovery rate) of Covid-19 and better access to WASH as well as socioeconomic factors

43

throughout this time for a significant amount of the indicators. Since a handful of research is

44

available to discuss the association between Covid-19 with other probable determinants along

45

with the nature and degree of their relationship, this study should be perceived as an expanded

1. Introduction:

51

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in December

52

2019, is causing an outbreak of respiratory disease (COVID-19 disease by WHO). The new

53

SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to spread by person-to-person contact (through respiratory droplets

54

over a short distance) or via faecal-oral routes (hypothesised by Heller et al. 2020). Studies have

55

shown that coronaviruses exist and can maintain their viability in sewage and hospital

56

wastewater, originating from the faecal discharge of infected patients. Concerns have been raised

57

over inequity in access to various prevention and control measures for slum dwellers, refugees

58

etc. (Singh et al. 2020), even though Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (DG, WHO) has urged a

59

“whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach” for Covid-19 (Lau et al. 2020). According to

60

Lau et al. (2020), one of the important reasons for this might be limited access to safe water and

61

sanitation. Connection of control of covid-19 and global access to handwashing facilities has also

62

been established for low-income countries (Brauer et al. 2020). The insecurity of water may also

63

act as a deterrent for covid-19 mitigation, especially in developing areas (Stoler et al., 2020).

64

Odith et al. (2020) have also emphasized probable induction of Covid-19 transmission rate from

65

the shortfall in water and sanitation, using Nigeria as a case study. Amankwaa & Fischer (2020)

66

and Jiwani & Antiporta (2020) have also emphasised on the effects of poor WASH services on

67

Covid-19 fatalities in sub-Saharan African countries. Caruso & Freeman (2020) have argued on

68

the effects of inequality of sanitation facility with relation to the spread of Covid-19. Mushi &

69

Shao (2020) have stated the possible role of WASH services regarding the prevention of the

70

further spread of covid-19, especially for lower- and middle-income countries. Ray (2020) have

71

opined on the importance of hygiene about Covid-19. All of these works indicate a possible

72

significant level of connection between inequality of WASH services and Covid-19. WHO and

73

UNICEF have long been suggested about the importance of WASH in itself (UNICEF 2019) and

74

also related to Covid-19 (WHO, 2020 a, b). Thus, these works indicate towards shortfalls WASH

75

may relate to higher Covid-19 (occurrence and transmission).

76

Some socio-economic and demographic parameters were closely associated with COVID-19

77

cases-fatality rate. These include - per capita gross national income, net migration, voters' turnout

78

ratio for Asian countries (Varkey et al. 2020), average age, the population density and density of

79

doctors in Germany (Ehlert, 2020), tourism (Farzanegan et al. 2020; Lapointe, 2020; Gössling et

80

al. 2020), household size, use of public transport, aged population and self-reported health for

81

England and Wales (Sá, 2020), mean income in the 10 districts of the city of Barcelona – Spain

82

(Baena-Díez et al., 2020), socioeconomic characteristics in neighbourhood community in 7 states

83

of USA (Hatef et al., 2020), early life environment, life trajectory and socioeconomic status

84

(Holuka et al. 2020), income and population density (Jani & Mavalankar, 2020), morbidity rate,

85

risky health behaviours, crowding, and population mobility in South Korea (Weinstein et al.

86

2020), poor healthcare infrastructure, high population and room density, and informal job

87

markets in low-income countries (UN Habitat, 2020; Mishra et al., 2020), poverty and income

88

inequality in ten Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) cities (Bolaño-Ortiz et al., 2020),

89

working age population (i.e. demographic composition) in Italy and South Korea (Dowd et al.,

90

2020), total population, poverty and income for some of the 31 countries in Europe (Sannigrahi

91

et al., 2020), population, GDP and population density for Wuhan, China (Xiong et al., 2020) etc.

92

These studies indicate a varied relationship between social, economic, demographic influencing

93

factors and Covid-19.

94

Apart from these, there are, at least 2 groups of real-time indicators which are supposed to have

95

intervened with the dynamic of Covid-19, one is government measures through lockdowns and

96

containment protocols and another is people’s daily behaviour and activities. First, has mostly

97

been interpreted through Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) (Hale et

98

al. 2020) and the second through Google community mobility reports (Google, 2020). Some

99

works have suggested in support of their association with Covid-19 (Carlitz and Makhura, 2020;

100

Castex et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020).

101

There are some drawbacks to these works. Either some studies have incorporated a selectively

102

few arrays of indicators, or their operational boundary is one or a group of countries of a region.

103

Also, most of them deal with Covid-19 dataset of one single date, whereas it is well known that

104

various parameters of this pandemic are very spatiotemporally dynamic i.e., changing with time

105

as well as space (Sahin et al., 2020). For these reasons, we have conceptualized this work.

2. Research Questions:
There are some features that we have tried to encapsulate in this study.
(a) Are the various indicators of Covid-19 and indicators of WASH-related, at the global
scale?

110

(b) If they are related, how much is their degree of association?

111

(c) Does their relationship remain similar throughout Covid-19 pandemic? i.e. Do the

112

WASH conditions are affecting covid-19 conditions similarly from the onset of the

113

pandemic?

(d) If the effect of WASH on indicators of Covid-19 have decreased over time, then what
about other socioeconomic factors?
(e) Are the various indicators of socioeconomic dimensions and indicators of WASH-related,
at the global scale?
(f) If socioeconomic factors and Covid-19 are related, how much is their degree of
association?
(g) Do the socioeconomic factors are affecting covid-19 conditions similarly from the onset
of the pandemic?
(h) If the effects of socioeconomic factors (excluding WASH) on indicators of Covid-19
have decreased over time, then what about stringency and mobility factors?
(i) If the stringency and mobility factors are related to Covid-19, how much is their degree
of association?
(j) Do the stringency and mobility factors affect covid-19 conditions similarly from the onset
of the pandemic?
3. Method and data:

129

We have collected data of water, sanitation and hygiene from WHO/UNICEF JMP (2017)

130

dataset and WDI (2020). We have used the data from the latest available year in this work. These

131

set of indicators have been used as indicators of socioeconomic status following the framework

132

used by Roy and Pramanick (2019). We have collected data of Covid-19 from for 6 different

133

dates (30th of March to 30th August, 2020) from JHU CCSE (2020). We have used data for 5

134

dimensions of water, 5 dimensions of sanitation, 3 dimensions of hygiene (i.e. 63 indicators of

135

WASH, suppl. table 1-3) and 5 dimensions (with 5 indicators) of Covid-19. Also, we have used

136

data for 21 dimensions (via 33 indicators) of socio-economy (except – WASH, suppl. table 4)

137

and 2 dimensions (with 7 indicators, suppl. table 5) of stringency and mobility. List of indicators

138

is given in table 1. More details about sub-indicators are provided in the supplementary file.

139

The statistical analysis has been conducted using R 3.6.2, (R Core Team. 2019) and ‘Hmisc’ (v.

140

4.4-0) package for performing correlation. Data for worldwide coronavirus cases are taken from

141

package ‘coronavirus’ (v. 0.2.0) from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and

142

Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository and analysed for cumulative cases for 6

143

different dates of consecutive 6 months (30-03-2020, 30-04-2020, 30-05-2020, 30-06-2020, 30-

144

07-2020 and 30-08-2020). Though this Covi-19 pandemic started in 31st Dec. 2019, we have

145

taken up March as our starting phase of consideration. Because, the spread of the SARS-CoV2

146

virus is asymmetrical for the countries of the world, and we can see that from March-April 2020,

147

it had spread to most of the countries of the world with varying degree. We have also selected

148

the span of the duration of study as 6 months (March-August, 2020), because – we think if

149

nothing severely disturbs the dynamics of pandemic (as we can see so far, Nov. 2020), six

150

months is sufficient to convey information about changing influence of various factors (WASH

151

or others) on Covid-19 pandemic. Spearman’s rank-order correlation has been used for finding

152

the association between the variables because the data is not normally distributed. Datasets, used

153

for analysis, is provided in the supplementary files.

4.1. WASH and Covid-19:

159

4.1.1. Water and Covid-19:

160

Most of the indicators that represent good socioeconomic condition related to water, like - basic

161

drinking water, piped services, on-premises services, available when needed services, safely

162

managed drinking water services etc. are strongly positively related to total confirmed, recovered

163

and death. They show a lesser degree of positive correlation with recovery rate and case fatality

164

rate. Another group of indicators that represent not so good socioeconomic condition related to

165

water, like – non-piped services, unimproved water services, limited water services etc. have a

166

strongly negative correlation to total confirmed, recovered and death. They show a lesser degree

167

of negative correlation with recovery rate and case fatality rate.

168

However, if we delve deeper into each indicator, the see some apparent conflict in results, for all

169

6 dates (i.e. total span under consideration of the study, 6 months), especially concerning total

170

confirmed (TC) and total death (TD). Some of the indicators that represent good (BDWS) or

171

better (IWS, IWS – P, IWS – AN, IWS - AP) conditions of safe and better access to water are

172

positively related to total confirmed and total death. Also, some of the indicators that represent

173

poor (UWS, LWS) of safe and better access to water are negatively related to total death.

174

4.1.2. Sanitation and Covid-19:

175

Most of the indicators that represent good socioeconomic condition related to sanitation, like –

176

basic sanitation services, improved sanitation facilities, sewer connection facilities, wastewater

177

treated facilities, septic tank facilities etc. are a higher degree of positive correlation to total

178

confirmed, recovered and death. They show a lesser degree of positive correlation with recovery

179

rate and even lesser with case fatality rate. Another group of indicators that represent not so good

180

socioeconomic condition related to sanitation, like – limited sanitation facilities, open defecation,

181

unimproved sanitation facilities etc. have a strongly negative correlation to total confirmed,

182

recovered and death. They show a less strong negative correlation with recovery rate and even

183

lesser with case fatality rate.

184

For all 6 dates (i.e. total span under consideration of the study, 6 months), some of the indicators

185

that represent poor (OD, USF, LSF) conditions of safe and better access to sanitation facilities

186

are negatively related to total death and confirmed. Also, indicators that represent good (BSS) or

187

better (ISF, ISF – SC, ISF – ST, ISF – WT, ISF - SM) conditions of safe and better access to

188

water are positively related to total confirmed and total death.

189

Indicators that depict poor (OD, USF, LSF) conditions of safe and better access to sanitation

190

facilities are negatively related to CFR; whereas indicators that represent good (BSS) or better

191

(ISF, ISF – SC, ISF – WT) conditions of safe and better access to water are positively related to

192

CFR.

193

4.1.3. Hygiene and Covid-19:

194

Basic handwashing facility has a higher degree of positive correlation to total confirmed,

195

recovered, death and recovery rate. However, it has a lesser degree of positive correlation with

196

the case fatality rate. Another group of hygiene indicator, that represent not so good

197

socioeconomic condition, like – limited and no handwashing facilities have a higher degree of

198

negative correlation with total confirmed, recovered, death and recovery rate. These have a lesser

199

degree of negative correlation with the case fatality rate.

200

Indicators that represent good (BHF) conditions of safe and better access to hygiene facilities are

201

positively correlated to total confirmed (TC) and total death (TD).

water, sanitation and hygiene, WASH access (n=63) for countries (n=175) in the world (March-

205

August, 2020).

206

The area marked in red box from the complete correlogram is the interest of this study. Hence,

207

these selected portions, for 6 consecutive months have been displayed in the lower part of this

208

figure.

209

4.1.4. Trends in WASH- Covid-19 relationships:

210

We can see from Fig 1 that the level of correlation, be it either positive or negative, has

211

decreased over time, i.e. from March to August 2020. This is similar to 3 indicators of Covid-19,

212

namely – total confirmed, recovered and death. Especially, from June 2020 onwards, this is very

213

distinct.

214

From the dendrogram (Suppl. Figure 1) of WASH-Covid-19, it is visible that there have 2

215

distinct groups throughout the study, one with case fatality and recovery and another with total

216

confirmed, recovered and death. Most of the indicators of WASH have remained polarized in

217

heatmap i.e., indicators of good and bad WASH conditions have remained in two opposite

218

correlation groups in case of one group (with total confirmed, recovered and death). But, for the

219

other group (containing case fatality rate and recovery rate), this is not distinctly different related

220

to WASH indicators.

221

4.2. Socioeconomic dimensions and Covid-19:

222

This study has identified a few contributory elements which have exhibited high association with

223

Covid-19 dynamics across the countries. Among health-related indicators, the share of health

224

expenditure, health security, life expectancy, physician-nurse density and per capita out-of-

225

pocket health expenditure have a higher degree of positive correlation with total confirmed,

226

recovered and death related to Covid-19. Two other health-related indicators have a lesser degree

227

of positive correlation with the same, namely – per capita share of health expenditure and crude

228

death rate. Share of per capita out-of-pocket health expenditure has a higher degree of negative

229

correlation with the same 3 indicators related to Covid-19.

230

Among economy-related indicators, globalization, real GDP and connectedness have a higher

231

degree of positive correlation with total confirmed, recovered and death related to Covid-19. But

232

the Gini coefficient has a lesser degree of negative correlation with the same.

233

Among demographic indicators, the median age of the population and aged population have a

234

higher degree of positive correlation than population density with total confirmed, recovered and

235

death; whereas the total population is negatively correlated with them.

236

Among societal indicators, literacy rate, democracy level, human capital and development,

237

international tourism arrival, the share of urban population and social progress have a higher

238

degree of positive correlation than with total confirmed, recovered and death; whereas

239

employment to population ratio, hunger level, the share of vulnerable employment,

240

unemployment and prevalence of deaths from water, sanitation and handwashing facilities have a

The area marked in red box from the complete correlogram is the interest of this study. Hence,

246

these selected portions, for 6 consecutive months have been displayed in the lower part of this

4.2.1. Trends in Socioeconomy- Covid-19 relationship:

249

From the dendrogram (Suppl. Figure 2) of socioeconomy-Covid-19, it is clearly visible that there

250

have 2 distinct groups throughout the study, one with case fatality and recovery and another with

251

the rest (i.e. total confirmed, recovered and death).

252

Mostly, the indicators of socioeconomic conditions have remained polarized in heatmap i.e.,

253

indicators of improved and poor socioeconomic conditions have remained in two opposite

254

correlation groups in case of one group (with total confirmed, recovered and death). But, for the

255

other group (containing case fatality rate and recovery rate), this is not distinctly different related

256

to socioeconomic indicators.

257

4.3. Stringency, mobility and Covid-19:

258

Among these indicators, time spent in residential areas (i.e. Rsd) has a higher degree of positive

259

correlation with total confirmed, recovered and death related to Covid-19, than stringency index

260

(SnI). On the other hand, the density of visitors in workplaces (WkP), transit stations (TnS) and

261

retail & recreation places (RnR) have a higher degree of negative correlation to those indicators

262

of Covid-19, than the density of visitors in grocery, pharmacy (GnP) and parks (Pks). Primarily

263

(i.e. March 2020), the case fatality rate is more correlated to these indicators that recovery rate,

264

and both have a lesser degree of correlation that aforementioned 3 indicators regarding Covid-19.

4.3.1. Trends in Stringency and mobility - Covid-19 relationships:

271

From the dendrogram (Suppl. Figure 3) of stringency-mobility-Covid-19, it is clearly visible that

272

there have 2 distinct groups during the earlier stage of study (March-May 2020), one with case

273

fatality and another with the rest (i.e. recovery, total confirmed, recovered and death). However,

274

its nature has changed in the following months (June – August 2020), one group with case

275

fatality and recovery and another group with the rest (i.e. total confirmed, recovered and death).

276

Mostly, the indicators of stringency and mobility conditions have not remained polarized in

277

heatmap i.e., the nature and degree of correlation are changing with time.

278

The overall time wise (here, month) change of number of significantly correlated associations

279

between Covid-19 and other 3 groups of indicators (viz. WASH, socioeconomic factors and

280

stringency & mobility) are shown in Fig 4.

5. Discussion:

285

From this study, there are some basic understanding that can be inferred. For the WASH sphere,

286

providing basic as well as improved drinking water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are directly

287

positively connected to the recovery rate of Covid-19. Likewise, reducing unimproved drinking

288

water, sanitation and open defecation is negatively connected to recovery rate. This means, not

289

only for the specific domain of WASH but inclusive access to these facilities are also connected

290

to the health sector as well as disaster prevention (like – a pandemic connected to water). The

291

hassle-free access of purified water (at least not associated to wastewater, Lapolla et al., 2020;

292

Bogler et al, 2020) at home premises (Frumkin et al., 2020; Kassem and Jaafar, 2020; Staddon et

293

al., 2020), access to improved sanitation facilities at household level as well as the availability of

294

household hygiene measures (in form of soaps, hand sanitizers etc.) (Schmidt, 2020; Yu et al.,

295

2020) have become the frontier force of precautionary prevention.

296

The other socio-economic factors also ascribe to similar perception regarding the covid-19

297

pandemic. Among the health-related factors, better health security, a higher density of physicians

298

and nurses, better life expectancy, higher per capita out of pocket expenditure and the lower

299

crude death rate is positively associated with better recovery rate. These results are in line with

300

Adams & Walls, 2020 (for healthcare workforce), Kandel et al., 2020 (for health security) etc.

301

Among the economic factors, higher real GDP, connectedness, globalization and lower economic

302

inequality are positively associated with a better rate of recovery. These outcomes are in line

303

with Makridis & Hartley, 2020 (for real GDP), McKibbin & Fernando, 2020 (for

304

macroeconomy) etc. Among the societal factors, higher literacy, social progress, democracy

305

score, human capital and development along with lower unemployment, employment

306

vulnerability and huger are associated with better recovery. These findings are also in line with

307

UNDP report (for human development), Khemraj & Yu, 2020 (for human capital), Kawohl &

308

Nordt, 2020 (for unemployment) etc (see Fig 5).

312

This new pandemic has undoubtedly emphasised the frivolity of the present condition as well as

313

the significance of the global WASH access system. These are the bare minimum requirements

314

which have been either neglected or not properly implemented (sometimes due to lack of

315

awareness). Other socioeconomic factors, though of varying degree, has a high level of

316

correlation with various indicators of the covid-19 pandemic. This entails towards the

317

importance of deliverance of socio-economic development globally.

318

There are some possible drawbacks in our work. Firstly, WASH data is from 2017, not

319

immediate pre-pandemic data. It is because WHO-UNICEF JMP dataset is most robust and

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173179; this version posted November 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

320

uniform till date. However, recently, there have been some issues regarding the applicability of

321

WASH data towards predicting the WASH-Covid19 relationship accurately (Quispe-Coica and

322

Pérez-Foguet, 2020). But we don’t have any better alternative. Second, the socio-economic

323

indicators are also not of immediately pre-pandemic time (see Suppl. Table 5). This is due to the

324

unavailability of the latest data (2019-20) for all of the socioeconomic indicators. Third, this

325

analysis has not been done on the sub-national or lower scale. Because the objective was to

326

understand the determinants of the covid-19 pandemic in general, for large scale. Also, the sub-

327

national data are not comprehensive and uniformly available for all countries. Fourth, the study

328

period (March-August 2020, i.e. 6 months) is odd. Though the onset and spread of covid-19

329

pandemic are asymmetric for different countries, we think from March 2020 onwards, it had

330

started in most of the major countries of the world. Also, we have taken 6 months (up to August

331

2020) because the study also tries to understand and lingering association of determinants with

332

Covid-19 pandemic, and as we can see from the data that this duration is long enough to serve

333

the purpose. Lastly, we have chosen only one date (30th of each month) which is not continuous.

334

We have taken nearly equidistant dates from each month as we think this is enough to give us a

335

broad outline of the role of determinants.

336

We see whatever kind of association do the determining factors have with those of Covid-19, the

337

degree is lessening through time (except – those related to mobility and stringency). This means

338

two things, (a) other factors (which are outside the operational boundary of this study) might be

339

getting superior control over the dynamics of Covid-19 than those included in this study, and/or

340

(b) the data of aforementioned determinants are of pre-pandemic time, means they are not being

341

updated daily or monthly (like – Covid-19). From this we can infer, these factors have been

342

determining the trajectory of the covid-19 pandemic in the old normal (pre-pandemic) as well as

343

will continue to do so in the new normal (post-pandemic). We think once robust data are

344

available of these determinants after the pandemic, we might see a similar level of association.

345

The present study has advocated the utility of interpreting determinants in epidemiological

346

research, which can be diverse, with this Covid-19 pandemic as a case of example. The present

347

work has explored the association between the WASH, social, demographic, mobility, economic

348

as well as health parameters and Covid-19, extracting insightful tales of dynamics of Covid-19

349

pandemic. Therefore, we hope, this study could be a reference for future health research and their

350

controlling factors towards synthesizing a multidisciplinary approach for either prevention or

351

control or both (Ross et al., 2020). Additionally, all the data used in this work are open source

352

and freely available (we have also provided the raw data and results in supplement), in so doing,

353

reproducibility, as well as scientific replicability, can be achievable.
