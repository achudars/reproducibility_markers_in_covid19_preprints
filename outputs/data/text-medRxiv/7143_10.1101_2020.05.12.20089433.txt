Summary

14

Objective: To evaluate the added value of the use of upper arm length (UAL) along with MUAC

15

(mid-upper arm circumference) to diagnose and estimate the prevalence of wasting in comparison

16

to current WHO standard and others MUAC based methods.

17

Design: We included UAL to usual anthropometric measurements during a Mauritanian national 6-

18

59-month-old cross-sectional nutritional survey. Children were classified into 3 groups UALG1,

19

UALG2 and UALG3 according to the following UAL limits: ≤ 150 mm, 151-180, and > 180mm

20

respectively. We used a Receiver Operating Characteristic curve to determine the best MUAC cut-

21

off for each group with weight-for-height Z score as a reference standard. We compared the wasting

22

prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, of all diagnostic methods.

23

Findings: In total, 12 619 children were included in the study. Wasting prevalence was 16.1%,

24

5.0% and 12.5% when diagnosed by WHZ < -2, MUAC < 125 mm and MUAC-UALG methods

25

respectively. Using the MUAC-UALG method increased the sensitivity for wasting diagnosis from

26

17.98 % with MUAC < 125 mm to 39.43% with MUAC-UALG. The specificity decreased from

27

97.49% with MUAC < 125 to 92.71% with MUAC-UALG. With MUAC-height Z score and

28

MUAC < 138 mm, sensitivity was 26.04% and 69.76%and specificity were 97.40%and 75.64%

29

respectively.

30

Conclusion: This alternative method using MUAC measuring tape to measure UAL increases the

31

wasting diagnosis accuracy and allows for a better estimation of wasting prevalence. This method

32

could be used as a potential alternative method for quick surveys in emergency settings such as

33

Corona virus disease 2019 context.

Introduction

37

Wasting is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries. The risk of death is

38

higher in wasted children defined by a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ) below -2, when compared

39

to non-wasted children(1). When diagnosed with wasting, children can be treated at home(2). The

40

earlier the child is diagnosed the shorter the duration of the treatment.3 However, wasting screening

41

and diagnosis has been a challenge for the entire humanitarian community. WHZ remains difficult

42

to obtain routinely at the community level as it requires heavy equipment and well-trained staff.

43

Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is therefore preferred in the field due to its simplicity

44

(MUAC < 115mm for severe wasting, MUAC < 125 mm for wasting) as per the WHO

45

recommendations.1 However, MUAC has shown its limits for wasting diagnosis as well as

46

prevalence estimation.

47

In 2019, wasting (as defined by WHZ score below -2) affected more than 47 million children under

48

five years old world-wide.4 Although both low WHZ and MUAC are recommended for wasting

49

diagnosis,1 only low WHZ is used for wasting prevalence evaluation by WHO.4 The use of current

50

WHO’s MUAC cut-off recommendation does not allow for wasting prevalence estimation with an

51

acceptable accuracy.5

52

Different MUAC cut-offs have been proposed in the past decades for wasting diagnosis (also called

53

acute malnutrition). In the 1960’s, a study based on a population of non-malnourished Polish

54

children showed that MUAC had little or no relation to age and gender in children aged one to five

55

years(6). Shakir A. and Morlaey D suggested a coloured cord to measure upper-arm circumference

56

for screening and diagnosis of wasting in children 6-59 months-old(7). Children were categorized in

57

three groups according to their MUAC: red, yellow and green for MUAC under 125 mm, between

58

125 mm and 135 mm, and over 135 mm respectively. In 1985 Bernt Lindtjorn showed that these

59

cut-off points greatly exaggerate wasting prevalence rates and proposed new cut-off points (110

60

mm and 130 mm)(8). Benr and Nathanail compared the WHZ < -2 and MUAC <125 mm methods

61

and concluded that these two methods identify similar proportions of wasted children(9). However,

62

beyond the cut-off itself, the use of a single cut-off for wasting diagnosis in all children within this

63

age range has been debated(10,11). Indeed, MUAC has been reported to be age specific and the use of

64

MUAC with a single cut-off underestimates wasting in older children(12,13). To address this bias, a

65

MUAC-based method taking into account child's age and sex has been implemented. A Z-score is

66

assigned to each child according to their MUAC, age and sex(14). However, the difficulty of

67

determining the children’s age led to the use of another index, based on MUAC, height, and sex(15).

68

These methods certainly improve the sensitivity of wasting diagnosis but are not simple enough to

69

be used for routine diagnoses. In fact, the determination of the children’s age on the one hand and

70

their exact height on the other hand are essential for the MUAC-age and MUAC-height indices.

71

Due to the necessity of calculating the Z-score for each child, both methods are not really routinely

72

used in the field.

73

We therefore considered an alternative method of wasting diagnosis with greater sensitivity and

74

greater potential for routine use. Children’s height or age is not required. The method is based on

75

the use of MUAC in relation to child's upper arm length (UAL) which can be measured at the same

76

time as the MUAC measurement, using the same measuring tape. We tested this method in a

77

nutritional survey conducted in July 2015 according to the methodology "Standardized Monitoring

78

and Assessment of Relief and Transitions" (SMART) in Mauritania. The current study aimed at

79

evaluating the added value of the use of UAL along with the MUAC to diagnose and estimate the

80

prevalence of wasting in comparison to the WHO standard as well as other MUAC based methods.

81
82

Methodology

83

Data collection

84

Data collected from the national SMART survey conducted in Mauritania in 2015 were used for the

85

present study(16). It was a cross-sectional survey with two-stage random sampling, led by the

86

nutrition department of the Ministry of Health with technical support from UNICEF. The survey

87

followed SMART survey’s guideline(17). All of the measurements were carried out by teams of

88

trained investigators who were experienced in taking anthropometric measurements. A national

89

representative sample of children under five years old was used for this survey.

90

Weight was measured with a precision of 100 g using an electronic SECA type weighing scale.

91

Height was measured in cm with a precision of 0.1 cm using SHORR toises. MUAC was collected

92

in all children aged 6 to 59 months with precision to 1 mm using MUAC tapes. UAL was measured

93

by the same MUAC tape as those used for MUAC measurement. This length corresponds to that

94

used to determine the mid-upper arm location, namely the length between the tip of the elbow (the

95

olecranon) and the tip of the scapula (acromion). The oedema was systematically searched at the top

96

of both feet by exerting a pressure with the thumb for 3 seconds. Standardization of the

97

measurements and plausibility checks were done according to the standards and recommendations

98

of the SMART methodology(17).

99
100

Data analysis

101

After a double entry to clean the anthropometric data, Z-scores were calculated using ENA Delta

102

software November 2014. Children were excluded from the analysis based on the following criteria:

103

MUAC, height, sex or weight not recorded, extreme WHZ (< -5 or > +5), or arbitrarily considered

104

extreme UAL (< 7 cm or > 30 cm). Wasting by low WHZ was defined by (WHZ < -2 using the

105

2006 WHO growth reference. Wasting by low MUAC-height Z score (MUAC-HZ) was defined by

106

MUAC-HZ < -2. Wasting by MUAC-125 mm (MUAC-125) was defined by MUAC < 125 mm.

107

Additionally, we compared our diagnosis approach with another MUAC cut-off proposed by

108

Laillou and colleagues, wasting by MUAC 138 mm (defined by MUAC < 138 mm)(18). Wasted

109

children (according to the WHZ <-2) were divided into the following three groups of the same size,

110

according to their UAL: Children with UAL ≤ 150mm, 151 ≤ UAL ≤ 180mm and UAL ≥ 180mm

111

were classified in UAL group1 (UALG1), UAL group2 (UALG2) and UAL group3 (UALG3)

112

respectively (Figure 1). In order to diagnose wasting by MUAC with different cut-offs, three

113

different cut-offs were established for each UALG. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

114

methodology was used to determine new MUAC cut-offs with improved sensitivity for wasting

115

diagnosis for each UALG with a minimum specificity of 90% (S1). Data were analysed using IBM

116

SPSS statistics software.

117

The accuracy of our diagnosis method was evaluated according to the STARD recommendation(19).

118

Wasting by WHZ <-2 was used as reference standard to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of

119

all the diagnosis methods that we tested. Sensitivity reflects the ability of the test to identify wasting

120

among those identified by WHZ <-2. Specificity reflects the ability to correctly identify non wasted

121

cases among those identified by WHZ >-2. Medcalc online version

122

(https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php ) was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity,

123

positive predictive value, negative predictive value, with 95% confidence interval for each wasting

124

diagnosis method.

125
126

Statistic tests

127

Mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous values. Correlations between

128

continuous variables were evaluated using pearson test. Mean UAL, MUAC, age, height, and WHZ

129

comparison among UAL groups was performed by Student T-tests. Wasting prevalence was

130

calculated for each wasting diagnostic method.

131
132

Results

133

Anthropometric measurements were taken from 12,626 children aged 6 to 59 months throughout

134

Mauritania. In total, 36 children (<0.29%) presenting missing or inaccurate data were excluded

135

from analysis (figure 2). A total of 12,590 children with 49.9% girls were included in this study. No

136

child was found with bilateral oedema during the survey.

137

Our results demonstrated that UAL was correlated to height (pearson correlation = 0.65, p< 0·001)

138

and age (pearson correlation = 0.62, p< 0.001) and MUAC was correlated to age (pearson

139

correlation = 0.45, p< 0.001) as well as height (pearson correlation = 0.51, p< 0.001)).

140

Using ROC curves with WHZ as a reference standard allowed to determine the following MUAC

141

cut-offs for each UALG for wasting diagnosis: 125mm, 130mm and 135mm for UALG1, UALG2

142

and UALG3 (figure 1 and S1).

143

The mean and standard deviation of childrens’ age, weight, and MUAC are described in table 1.

144

Mean MUAC, height, and age significantly increased with UALG (p < 0.001) (table 1). The

145

prevalence of wasting as determined by WHZ < -2 was 12.5% (table 2). When evaluated by

146

MUAC-UALG method, wasting prevalence was 16.1%. With MUAC-125, MUAC-HZ and

147

MUAC-138 the prevalence of wasting was 5.0%, 6.3% and 31.7% respectively.

148

The diagnosis test accuracy for each indicator is summarised in the table 3. Overall, MUAC-125

149

had the lowest sensitivity (17.98% [16.33% ; 19.73%]) and the highest specificity (97.49% [97.18 ;

150

97.78]) (table 3). With single fixed cut-off indicators (MUAC-125 or MUAC-138) sensitivity

151

decreases, and specificity increases with UALG. This was not observed with adapted cut-offs

152

(MUAC-HZ or MUAC-UALG) (S2). Although MUAC-138 had the highest sensitivity (69.76%

153

[67.71 ; 71.76]), it had the lowest specificity (75.64% [74.81 ; 76.45]) leading to more than 24 %

154

false positives. MUAC-UALG had a higher sensitivity (39.43% [37.29 ; 41.59]) than MUAC-125

155

and MUAC-HZ. MUAC-UALG had a higher specificity than MUAC-138 and a lower specificity

156

than MUAC-HZ and MUAC-125.

157

MUAC-125 had a lower PPV (57.87% [54.15 ; 61.50]) than MUAC-HZ (65.62% [62.43 ; 68.67])

158

and a lower NPV than that of all other indicators. MUAC-138 had the lowest PPV (35.42% [34.42 ;

159

36.44]) although the NPV was the highest among the indicators (92.89% [92.43 ; 93.32]).

160
161

Discussion.

162

In this study, we demonstrated two principal results related to the use of MUAC-UALG.

163

First, the use of UAL along with MUAC enhanced WHZ based wasting prevalence estimation

164

(table 2). Wasting prevalence evaluated by MUAC-UALG was the closest to that of WHZ < -2

165

when compared to other existing diagnosis methods. Using MUAC-125 and MUAC-HZ, wasting

166

prevalence was three and two times lower than that of WHZ < -2 respectively. Wasting prevalence

167

determined by MUAC-138 was almost three times higher than that of WHZ < -2. Fixed cut-off

168

MUAC often overestimates or underestimates the number of wasting cases, depending on the

169

threshold chosen.9,13 A fixed cut-off of 138 mm makes it possible to diagnose cases of wasting in

170

older children but overestimates the number of wasting cases in the youngest children. Wasting

171

prevalence according to the WHO standard MUAC cut-off of 125 mm is two times lower than that

172

determined by the WHZ <-2 (table 2). When using a fixed cut-off at 138mm, the prevalence is two

173

times higher than the prevalence using WHZ <-2. With the MUAC-UALG method, more wasted

174

children belonging to UAL groups 2 and 3 can be diagnosed.

175

Second, the use of UAL in combination with MUAC enhanced the wasting diagnosis accuracy. We

176

selected MUAC cut offs for each UALG in such a way to minimize the number of false positives

177

(S1). Higher sensitivity could be obtained by selecting higher MUAC cut offs for each UALG, but

178

we believe that this approach would have a negative impact on the malnutrition management

179

system. Although the whole community needs nutrition interventions, those who are malnourished

180

need it more. In our study, around 82 % (1- Sensitivity) of children with WHZ < -2 were not

181

diagnosed with wasting when the current WHO MUAC cut off (MUAC-125) was used (table 3).

182

The use of this single cut-off leaves older children behind, but using a higher single cut off is not

183

adequate either. Indeed, an increasingly high rate of non-malnourished children could rise health

184

workers’ burden and affect the quality wasting management. Although MUAC-ULAG alone could

185

not detect all malnourished children, the overlap between WHZ and MUAC-UALG is higher than

186

the overlap between MUAC-125 and WHZ. The MUAC-UALG method allows children’s age (for

187

non-stunted children) and height to be taken into account through their arm length, unlike with the

188

MUAC-125 approach. Fiorentino and colleagues showed that MUAC-125 was more adapted to

189

younger children(20). Thus, this method will allow field workers to diagnose more wasted children

190

according to WHZ compared to the use of MUAC 125. MUAC by age group could be considered as

191

a viable method but would not be accurate in stunted children. Moreover, children’s ages are not

192

always easy to determine in the field, whereas UAL can be measured very easily. Fiorentino and

193

colleagues had proposed different cut-offs according to age group and sex for children under five

194

years old. With their method, the sensitivity ranged between 68% and 70% but the false positive

195

rate was high, ranging between 30% and 32%(20). Further studies on MUAC-UALG that evaluate

196

the link with mortality are needed. Studies investigating wasting diagnostic methods could consider

197

the MUAC-UALG as a diagnosis mean for comparison in the future(21). Except for the MUAC-HZ

198

for which ENA software did not provide values for 79 children, each indicator’s accuracy was

199

calculated in the same population. Thus, indicator accuracies were compared with no risk of

200

statistical bias. The MUAC-UALG method does not require any harmful nor stressful actions

201

against children.

202

The study was conducted in the Mauritanian population which is not representative of the world

203

population. However, a multi-centric study in different populations is feasible given the simplicity

204

of collecting children’s UAL. WHZ was used as a reference standard for this study although this

205

index is only a proxy for wasting. The overlap ratio between WHZ and MUAC varies by country.5

206

However, WHZ is widely used and accepted for wasting prevalence estimation around the world by

207

the WHO. A more specific wasting diagnosis tool is needed in the future to compare with MUAC-

208

UALG. Other alternative approaches could be used to evaluate the accuracy of MUAC-UALG

209

method to identify more vulnerable children. Thus, MUAC-UALG mortality and or morbidity

210

prediction capacity, and its association with wasting clinical biomarkers among children with low

211

grade inflammation status could be considered.

212

At the community level, compared to the WHZ method, it is easier to use the MUAC-UALG which

213

does not require any investment in equipment to measure height and weight. Measuring height and

214

weight can be a challenge in emergency settings such as in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

215

context. The portability of the MUAC tape is an advantage for its adoption by community health

216

workers. The cost is also much lower than a scale measuring height and weight. Three MUAC

217

tapes with different cut-offs according to UALG can be used by community health workers in the

218

field for wasting diagnosis.

219

This study is aligned with the Council of Research & Technical Advice on Acute Malnutrition

220

(CORTASAM) recommendations regarding the priority research(22). Indeed, CORTASM group has

221

recognized that the current MUAC admissions criteria for wasting (MUAC-115mm) does not select

222

for all high-risk children, leaving behind some children who would be diagnosed as wasted by

223

WHZ or WAZ methods. More research is needed concerning the options available to identify these

224

high-risk children and ensure successful diagnosis and treatment, but the MUAC-UALG method is

225

a promising candidate.

226

To our knowledge, the use of UAL in wasting diagnosis has never been proposed. This method

227

does not add any additional tasks to the diagnostic process and has the potential to improve it. This

228

method could be adopted in the field as a part of monitoring nutritional status of children and as an

229

admission criterion in community-based management of acute malnutrition. Like MUAC-height or

230

MUAC-age z-score, future studies aimed at the creation of a MUAC-UAL z-score should be

231

considered. Using upper arm length-for-age z-score could also be considered as a substitute for the

232

height-for-age method in diagnosing cases of chronic malnutrition. Indeed, UAL is simpler and less

233

expensive than height measurement. A comparison of each child's UAL with a same age and sex

234

reference population could be considered for stunting diagnosis. Thus, in nutrition programs,

235

weight-for-age monitoring could be supplemented with UAL-for-age in cases where children’s

236

height is not known.

237

Beside wasting, obesity is also a major concern even in LMIC.4 Increasing the MUAC cut-off for

238

wasting diagnosis for all children could have a negative impact if many non-wasted children who

239

will receive treated. It could also prevent those in need to get enough supplements in an event of

240

shortage. Our data showed that 9.6% of children were considered as wasted despite having a Body

Mass Index Z-score > -1 when MUAC < 138mm. With MUAC-UALG this percentage drops to

242

2.6%.

243
244

Conclusion

245

The diagnosis of wasting by a fixed cut-off MUAC has limitations that can be mitigated by the use

246

of MUAC-for-height and MUAC-for-age indicators. The complexity of accurately collecting age

247

and height in the field makes MUAC-UALG a good alternative for wasting diagnosis and

248

prevalence estimation. MUAC-UALG could be used in emergency setting such as in COVID-19

249

context. The sensitivity and specificity of this method is higher than that of fixed MUAC cut-off

250

methods and remains close to that of the MUAC-for-height and MUAC-for-age methods in

251

Mauritanian children. Thus, using UAL along with MUAC enhances the accuracy of wasting

252

diagnosis and the estimation of wasting prevalence. Future studies involving data from more

253

children in different regions may lead to new perspectives on the use of MUAC-UALG as an

254

anthropometric measure to diagnose wasting in developing countries. We recommend the inclusion

255

of arm length in every national nutritional survey to collect more data for a multi-centric study.
