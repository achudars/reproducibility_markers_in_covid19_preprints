Abstract

31

Objectives:

32

Cardiovascular conditions were shown to be predictive of clinical deterioration in hospitalised

33

patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this also holds for outpatients

34

managed in primary care is yet unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the

35

incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability in predicting the risk of hospital referral in

36

primary care COVID-19 outpatients.

37

Design:

38

Analysis of anonymised routine care data extracted from electronic medical records from

39

three large Dutch primary care registries.

40

Setting:

41

Primary care.

42

Participants:

43

Consecutive adult patients seen in primary care for COVID-19 symptoms in the ‘first wave’ of

44

COVID-19 infections (March 1 2020 to June 1 2020) and in the ‘second wave’ (June 1 2020

45

to April 15 2021) in the Netherlands.

46

Outcome measures:

47

A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to predict hospital referral within 90 days

48

after first COVID-19 consultation in primary care. Data from the ‘first wave’ was used for

49

derivation (n=5,475 patients). Age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the

50

number of cardiovascular conditions and/or diabetes (0, 1, or ≥2) were pre-specified as

51

candidate predictors. This full model was (i) compared to a simple model including only age

52

and sex and its interaction, and (ii) externally validated in COVID-19 patients during the

53

‘second wave’ (n=16,693).

54

Results:

55

The full model performed better than the simple model (likelihood ratio test p<0.001). Older

56

male patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions and/or diabetes had the highest

57

predicted risk of hospital referral, reaching risks above 15-20%, whereas on average this risk

58

was 5.1%. The temporally validated c-statistic was 0.747 (95%CI 0.729-0.764) and the model

59

showed good calibration upon validation.

60

Conclusions:

61

For patients with COVID-19 symptoms managed in primary care, the risk of hospital referral

62

was on average 5.1%. Older, male and cardiovascular vulnerable COVID-19 patients are

63

more at risk for hospital referral.

Introduction

87

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic ever since the first

88

cases were described in late 2019. In order to orchestrate the flow of patients depending on

89

the expected course of the disease, the need arose for risk profiling patients suffering most

90

from COVID-19. Since then, a fast-growing amount of prediction models have been

91

developed for prognosticating COVID-19 patients. However, most of these models focus on

92

an in-hospital population, with only few prediction models focusing on the community.(1) This

93

is unfortunate as the clinical presentation of (suspected) COVID-19 starts-off with initially

94

mild to moderate symptoms in the first week of illness, and only in some with progression to

95

hypoxemia for which hospital (or even ICU) admission is needed, typically occurring in the

96

second week of illness.(2) If such deterioration occurs, the primary care physician is often the

97

first to decide on the need and optimal timing for more impactful measures, such as

98

intensified monitoring or ultimately referral for hospitalisation. In hospitalised COVID-19

99

patients, underlying cardiovascular diseases have been identified as strong predictors for

100

further disease deterioration towards ICU admittance or death.(3–7) The incremental value of

101

cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes in predicting escalation of care in primary care

102

COVID-19 patients has, however, yet to be determined.

103
104

The aim of this study was to determine the incremental value of cardiovascular vulnerability –

105

defined by the number of cardiovascular diseases and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus – in

106

predicting the risk of hospital referral in primary care patients with clinically suspected or

107

confirmed COVID-19. Results from this analysis are intended to explore the incremental

108

prognostic value of concurrent cardiovascular disease in community COVID-19 outpatients,

109

and – if indeed present – to support clinical decision making on COVID-19 early disease

110

management and vaccination prioritization for primary care physicians.

Study design

114

This study involves an analysis of anonymised observational electronic medical record data

115

of community people registered by the primary care physician with either confirmed or

116

clinically suspected COVID-19. We assessed the incremental value of cardiovascular

117

disease and/or diabetes by developing a prognostic prediction model in a cohort of patients

118

from the ‘first wave’ of COVID-19 infections in the Netherlands (March 1 2020 to June 1

119

2020) that was temporally validated in a cohort of patients from the ‘second wave’ of

120

infections in the Netherlands (June 1 2020 to April 15 2021). Where appropriate for this

121

study, we adhered to the TRIPOD guideline for reporting prediction models.(8)

122
123

Databases

124

Patients were included from three similar ongoing and dynamic primary care databases run

125

by the academic hospitals of the cities and surrounding municipalities of Utrecht and

126

Amsterdam, containing pseudonymised medical data of approximately 850,000 patients in

127

total: the Julius General Practitioner’s Network (JGPN) University Medical Center Utrecht,

128

the Academic Network of General Practice at VU University medical center in Amsterdam

129

(ANH VUmc), and the Academic General Practitioner’s Network at Academic Medical Center

130

Amsterdam (AHA AMC).(9–11) Two databases (JGPN and ANH VUmc) were used to identify

131

patients for the development of the prediction model (i.e. development cohort) and all three

132

databases (JGPN, ANH VUmc and AHA AMC) were used to identify patients for the temporal

133

validation (i.e. the validation cohort).

134
135

Study population and data collection

136

Patients for the development cohort were included from March 1 2020 to June 1 2020 (the

137

‘first wave’ of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands). During this time period, very

138

limited polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for COVID-19 was available, and moreover

139

mainly restricted to more severe hospitalised cases. Consequently, many symptomatic

140

patients consulting their GP were highly suggestive of COVID-19 and were not tested. We

141

therefore included all consecutive adult patients aged 18 years or older, who visited their

142

primary care physician with confirmed COVID-19 as well as those with symptoms that were

143

clinically suspected by the GP.

144
145

For identification of the study population and data collection, the same methods were applied

146

in all three databases. Dutch primary care physicians record diagnoses and clinical

147

symptoms in the electronic medical records as diagnostic codes using the International

148

Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) coding system. The primary care physicians

149

participating in the JGPN, AHA AMC and ANH Vumc databases are trained in and

150

experienced with using ICPC codes. For the development cohort, COVID-19 suspected

151

patients were identified using the ICPC codes R74 (acute upper respiratory infection), R81

152

(pneumonia) and R83 (other respiratory infection). At the time, primary care physicians were

153

recommended to use R81 and R83 for indicating COVID-19 suspected and COVID-19

154

confirmed cases, respectively, for lack of COVID-19 specific ICPCs. Records of patients

155

labelled with ICPC R74 (unspecified acute upper respiratory infection) were manually

156

screened for COVID-19 suspicion in the consultation text by three (primary care) clinical

157

scientists (FSvR, LPTJ, and SvD) and cases of doubt were discussed until agreement was

158

reached. Patients with ICPC R74 yet without having a synonym of or reference to COVID-19

159

suspicion or related symptoms in the consultation text were excluded from the cohorts. Of all

160

included patients, baseline characteristics (i.e. age; sex; relevant diagnoses; and if available

161

Body Mass Index (BMI), oxygen saturation and C-Reactive Protein (CRP)) were collected.

162

(History) of relevant diseases (i.e. cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus,

163

hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, pulmonary diseases, cancer) were identified using

164

ICPC. Supplementary table 1 contains all ICPC codes that were used for this study.

165
166

For the validation cohort, consecutive adult JGPN patients were included from September 1

167

2020 until April 15 2021, and consecutive adult AHA AMC and ANH Vumc patients were

168

included from June 1 2020 until December 31 2020 (the ‘second wave’ of COVID-19

169

infections). At this point in time, the Dutch government made PCR COVID-19 tests freely

170

available and these were recommended for all symptomatic subjects in the Netherlands and

171

for those who were in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Moreover, at that

172

time GPs were instructed to uniformly code confirmed cases in their medical records (i.e.

173

using ICPC codes either R83 or R83.03). Thus, only confirmed COVID-19 cases (i.e. with

174

ICPC R83 and R83.03) were included in the cohort for validation of the model.

175
176

Outcome

177

The primary outcome of the prediction model in this study was referral to an emergency ward

178

for intended hospital admission. This was defined as any clinical deterioration resulting in

179

hospital referral by the primary care physician that was recorded as such in the consultation

180

annotation (free text) of the medical record. To capture the full spectrum of complications of

181

COVID-19 resulting in hospitalisation, follow-up lasted 90 days after first consultation for

182

COVID-19 suspected symptoms. To this end, all anonymised consultation texts were

183

manually screened for any emergency hospital referral by (primary care) clinical scientists

184

(FSvR, LPTJ, SvD, and GJG) and cases of doubt were discussed, until consensus was

185

reached.

186
187

Candidate predictors

188

Based upon existing literature from hospitalised COVID-19 patients, we a-priori specified the

189

following candidate predictors prior to the analysis phase: age, sex, the interaction between

190

age and sex, and the number of cardiovascular diseases. The latter was defined as (history

191

of) type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease,

192

stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or

193

deep venous thrombosis; VTE), and/or atrial fibrillation (AF). Presence of these diseases was

194

based on the corresponding ICPCs (supplementary table 1) at any point before the first

195

COVID-19 consultation in the patient’s medical record. The number of cardiovascular

196

diseases were counted per patient and categorised into: no cardiovascular disease, one

197

cardiovascular disease, or two or more cardiovascular diseases.

198
199

Sample size

200

The model development cohort in JGPN and ANH Vumc yielded 5,475 eligible patients with

201

an event fraction of 0.068 (6.8%, n=373) for the primary outcome referral to the hospital.

202

Prior to prediction analysis, the number of allowed candidate predictors was determined.

203

Based on the proposed calculation for sample size in prediction modelling by Riley et al.(12),

204

the maximum number of candidate predictors that can be modelled was 30 with a R2 Cox-

205

Snell (R2cs) of 0.0495. As this R2cs was estimated in absence of a known value, varying

206

R2cs from 0.0395 to 0.0595 yielded a minimum of 24 and a maximum of 37 candidate

207

predictors, including interaction terms. By using the candidate predictors age, sex, the

208

interaction between age and sex, and the number of cardiovascular diseases with three

209

categories, the sample size of 5,475 eligible patients was deemed sufficient and large

210

enough for model development.

211
212

Missing data

213

Candidate predictors age, sex and cardiovascular disease had no missing data. Missing

214

values in baseline of characteristics measurements of CRP, BMI and oxygen saturation level

215

were not imputed as these determinants were not used further in predictive modelling.

216
217

Statistical analyses

218

Baseline characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics with categorical

219

variables as numbers with percentages and continuous variables as means with standard

220

deviations or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). A multivariable logistic regression

221

modelling approach was used. All included patients were entered in a fixed model (full

222

model) with the predictors age, sex, the interaction between age and sex, and the categorical

223

number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes. To determine the incremental value of

224

the predictor number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes, a second model (simple

225

model) was fitted using only the predictors age, sex, and the interaction between age and

226

sex. Age was considered as a continuous variable and was studied using a restricted cubic

227

spline function to account for possible non-linearity with 4 knots on the percentiles 0.05, 0.35,

228

0.65 and 0.95.(13) Number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes was taken as a

229

dummy variable with ‘no cardiovascular disease’ as reference category. The incremental

230

value of the number of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes was studied comparing the

231

full and simple model’s c-statistics (∆AUC), Cox-Snell R2cs (∆R2cs), and a likelihood ratio

232

test. To determine incremental value, an alpha of 0.05 was used for the likelihood ratio test.

233

The full model was internally validated using Harrell’s bootstrapping with 100 repetitions to

234

obtain optimism corrected estimates of the c-statistic, and R2 and slope were calculated. For

235

the temporal external validation of the full model, calibration and discrimination were

236

evaluated: observed and predicted events were calculated and depicted in calibration plots

237

and for discrimination areas under the curve (AUC/c-statistic) were calculated. Other

238

performance measures for temporal external validation that were calculated are: calibration

239

slope, calibration intercept, calibration in the large, R2cs, and Brier score. Brier scores assess

240

the overall goodness of fit of models, with smaller numbers indicating better performance.

241

Confidence intervals for c-statistics were obtained using the Delong method. For R2cs and

242

Brier score confidence intervals, bootstrapping was used with repetitions set at 1000.

243

Validation was done in the whole validation dataset as well as separately in the JGPN, ANH

244

VUmc, and AHA AMC validation cohorts. All statistical analyses were performed in R version

245

4.0.3 with R base, rms, pROC, DescTools, and rmda packages.(14–18)

258

Results

259

Patient characteristics

260

Patient characteristics of the (clinically suspected and confirmed COVID-19) development

261

cohort are described in table 1. There were 5,475 patients included in this cohort: 2,825 from

262

JGPN and 2,650 from ANH VUmc. In JGPN, 64.6% of the patients were coded as R74,

263

14.7% as R81, and 21.3% as R83. In ANH VUmc, 71.5% were coded as R74, 10.7% as

264

R81, and 19.2% as R83. Differences in patient characteristics between both datasets in the

265

development cohort were minor. Around a quarter of patients suffered from one or more

266

cardiovascular disease, most often type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.

267
268

Patient characteristics of the (confirmed COVID-19) validation cohort are described in table

269

2. From the total of 16,693 patients in the validation cohort 5,420 originated from JGPN,

270

4,989 from ANH VUmc, and 6,284 from AHA AMC. The patient characteristics in these three

271

datasets were very similar. Around 15-20% suffered from one or more cardiovascular

272

disease, again most often type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease.

273
274

Model development and internal validation

275

All 5,475 patients in de development cohort were used for model development. 373 patients

276

(6.8%) had the outcome hospital referral. All predefined model regression coefficients of the

277

full and simple models with confidence intervals are shown in table 3. The apparent c-

278

statistic of the full model was 0.693 (95%CI 0.665-0.721) and the internally validated c-

10

279

statistic was 0.688 (95%CI 0.660-0.716). The apparent c-statistic of the simple model was

280

0.681 (95%CI 0.653-0.710) and the internally validated c-statistic was 0.680 (95%CI 0.652-

281

0.708). The full and the simple model are compared in table 4. The full model performed

282

significantly better than the simple model (p- value for likelihood ratio test, ߯ ଶ = 19.5, df = 2,

283

p<0.001). Figure 1 gives a visual representation of the full model showing the predicted risks

284

of hospital referral as a function of (increasing) age, stratified by sex and by the number of

285

cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes. Overall risks are higher for male patients and

286

increase with age. Furthermore, a higher risk is observed in patients with underlying

287

cardiovascular disease.

288
289

Temporal external validation

290

Predicted risks were overall slightly higher than the observed risk (6.2% versus 4.6%) and

291

the calibration slope was 1.36. Overall discrimination showed an AUC of 0.747 (95%CI

292

0.729-0.764). Performance measures based on the full validation cohort and stratified by

293

database are shown in table 5. The overall calibration plot and the calibration plots per

294

database separately are shown in supplementary figure 1. The hospital referral prevalence

295

was lower in the validation datasets than in the development datasets (4.7% versus 6.8%).

296
297

Discussion

298

Cardiovascular vulnerability is a predictor of hospital referral in a population of 5,475

299

consecutive adult patients in primary care with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 in

300

the ‘first wave’ of infections in the Netherlands. This finding was confirmed by temporal

301

validation in a population of 16,693 consecutive confirmed COVID-19 adult primary care

302

patients in the ‘second wave’, exemplifying the robustness of our inferences. On average, in

303

the combined data from the first and second wave (n=22,168 confirmed and clinically

304

suspected primary care COVID-19 patients), 5.1% was referred to the hospital for

305

considering admission. A model including the number of cardiovascular conditions and/or

306

diabetes (0, 1, or ≥2) in addition to age and sex and the interaction between age and sex,

307

showed moderate to good performance and demonstrated consistent and good

308

discrimination and calibration upon temporal external validation. The model showed a c-

309

statistic of 0.747 (95%CI 0.729-0.764).

310
311

Although most COVID-19 patients experience a favourable prognosis without the need for

312

referral for hospital care, studies on COVID-19 mainly focussed on those seen in the hospital

313

setting. While on average the overall risk for hospital referral in this adult primary care cohort

314

with COVID-19 was low (5.1%), it is much higher than the hospitalisation rate for other lower

315

respiratory infections in primary care which is estimated at approximately 1% of the adult

316

population affected.(19) In our study, age, sex and the number of concurrent cardiovascular

317

conditions and/or diabetes predicted patients at far greater risk of hospital referral. In fact, for

318

female patients without cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, the risk of hospital referral was

319

well below 10% even in the eldest elderly (aged 80+). Contrastingly, in the presence of

320

cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes, patients experience higher risks already at younger

321

ages, notably males. For instance, a male patient with two or more underlying cardiovascular

322

diseases and/or diabetes, had a predicted risk of 15% already at the age of around 57 years

323

and this predicted risk will even further increase to above 20% from the age of 80 onwards.

324

This indicates the incremental effect of cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes in addition to

325

age and sex in predicting the risk for complicated COVID-19 disease trajectories in primary

326

care patients.

327
328

Our findings overall confirm those from previous studies done in the hospital setting where

329

age and male sex are important predictors for disease progression towards the endpoints

330

ICU admission or death.(1,20–22) Social, behavioural, comorbidity and biological differences

331

(ACE2 expression, sex-hormones, X-chromosome exposure) between male and female

332

sexes all might contribute to the higher risks of COVID-19 progression observed in males,

333

although probably not all mechanisms have been fully elucidated yet.(23,24) Also, in

334

hospitalised patients, it has been demonstrated that there is an association between

335

cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 complicated disease trajectories, with higher

336

prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes described in those with critical illness. (3–

337

7,25) Our study shows that this prognostically unfavourable effect is already present much

338

earlier on in the COVID-19 disease course, at the start of symptoms in primary care.

339
340

This is in line with previous research, where this additive effect of (cardiovascular)

341

comorbidities was also described by the 4C Mortality Score.(26) In this study, the authors

342

demonstrated that the number of comorbidities, importantly including cardiovascular

343

comorbidities, had a more predictive effect than taking only individual co-morbidities in

344

predicting in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients.(26) Furthermore, there are two large

345

community-based prediction studies also highlighting the importance of cardiovascular

346

comorbidities as a predictor in the community COVID-19 population. The QCOVID model

347

that was developed in the UK was based on data from primary care and showed a c-statistic

348

>0.9 for the primary outcome time to death from COVID-19. The domain of that study,

349

however, covered the whole general population regardless of COVID-19 diagnosis and

350

therefore this can best be interpreted as the risk prediction of getting infected with COVID-19

351

and subsequently having complications from COVID-19. Thus, the aim of this model was to

352

inform UK health policy and support interventions to manage COVID-19 related risks, rather

353

than inform medical decision making during patient consultations in confirmed or clinically

354

suspected COVID-19 cases.(27) With only 0.07% with the outcome death, and thus very low

355

a priori chance, the c-statistic ‘misleadingly’ moves towards 1.0. Another similar public health

356

based UK study in patients with and without COVID-19 identified determinants that were

357

associated with COVID-19 related death in the OpenSAFELY primary care database by

358

linking primary care records to reported COVID-19 related deaths. It found the most

359

predictive clinical determinants to be increasing age, male sex, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and

360

cardiovascular disease, similar to our findings.(28) While the domain notably differs between

361

patients seeking primary care for COVID-19 symptoms in our study and the adult community

362

as a whole in these studies form the UK, all draw similar conclusions on the increased risk of

363

clinical deterioration in patients with (multiple) cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes.

364
365

Strengths and limitations

366

This research contributes to the evidence-based prognostication of community COVID-19.

367

We were able to use routine primary care databases capturing both the ‘first’ and ‘second’

368

wave of COVID-19 infections in the Netherlands. We used state-of-the-art methodology

369

including external temporal validation to predict clinical deterioration in a patient population

370

that is currently understudied. For full appreciation of our findings, however, some limitations

371

also need to be addressed. First, the model was developed in a dataset with a low event

372

fraction of the outcome hospital referral. Yet the number of hospital referral events did allow

373

us to perform robust multivariable regression techniques. Second, there are limitations to

374

using routine care registry data that could have resulted in misclassification of the study

375

population, predictors and outcome, and most importantly it has the risk of missing values.

376

For example, uncertainty concerning COVID-19 infection status may exist (primarily in the

377

first wave) as COVID-19 PCR test results were not automatically linked to the primary care

378

electronic medical records. However, the model proved its transportability in primary care

379

patients in a different time period with satisfactory calibration and discrimination, during a

380

time window where PCR testing was widely performed. Furthermore, the outcome hospital

381

referral was based upon a rigorous manual extraction of medical records by pairs of

382

researchers, albeit hospitalisation was not formally confirmed based upon linkage to hospital

383

records. Additionally, there are differences between our development and validation

384

population: the patients from the ‘first wave’ are all symptomatic patients that visited their

385

primary care physician for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, while the patients from the

386

‘second wave’ – due to government recommendation for individuals to get tested even in the

387

circumstance of only mild symptoms – also include more healthy people that just informed

388

their primary care physician of their positive COVID-19 PCR status. This could also explain

389

the lower event fraction in the validation set (4.7% versus 6.8% in the development

390

population). Finally, the incremental value of the number of cardiovascular diseases and

391

diabetes on prognosticating COVID-19 was assessed in different ways; although we did

392

observe a highly significant change in the likelihood ratio test, the delta in c-statistic and R2cs

393

was only small to modest. Possible reasons for this include the overall low risk of hospital

394

referral in most patients in our cohort, as well as that most patients (80.2%) in fact in our

395

cohort did not suffer from cardiovascular diseases and/or diabetes. It has been widely

396

acknowledged that, notably in such scenario’s, a change in e.g. the c-statistic is difficult to

397

achieve.

398
399

Clinical implications

400

The readily availability of the chosen primary care predictors and the clinical applicability may

401

provide great advantages for risk profiling patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in

402

the primary care and community setting. This can have several important clinical and public

403

health implications. First, it may be possible to identify patients that will benefit from closer

404

monitoring and frequent follow-up at home by predicting the risk of clinical deterioration early

405

on in the COVID-19 disease course. By intensified monitoring of higher risk patients, critical

406

illness may be detected earlier, potentially improving prognosis. Second, risk prediction could

407

also support advanced care planning. Informing both patients and physicians on the risk of

408

severe illness, may help in anticipating a more stringent or more lenient management. Last,

409

risk profiling may be used for targeting preventive measures. Vaccination strategies to

410

prevent (severe) COVID-19, for instance, may prioritise those with cardiovascular disease

411

and/or diabetes. Additionally, experimental regiments to treat symptomatic COVID-19 may

412

be addressed to high-risk patients that may benefit most. Examples include for instance

413

treatment with budesonide or colchicine; both treatment options likely benefit patients most at

414

higher prior probability of having an adverse prognosis.(29,30) Nevertheless, in the end, risk

415

prediction in primary care has to prove its value in daily practice at the background of

416

changing characteristics of this challenging COVID-19 pandemic and influences of

417

vaccination and virus mutations. We however do hope that prognostic studies, like ours, may

421

Conclusion

422

In this primary care population-based study, risk of clinical deterioration leading to hospital

423

referral after suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was on average 5.1%. This risk increased

424

with age and was higher in males compared to females. Importantly, patients with concurrent

425

cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes had higher predicted risks. Identifying those at risk

426

for hospital referral could have clinical implications for COVID-19 vaccination and early

427

disease management in primary care.
