Abstract
Background
Understanding the perception and concerns of people about COVID-19 vaccine in developing
and populous country like India will help in understanding demand for the vaccine and further
tailoring out public health information and education activities before the launch of the vaccine.
The study was carried out to assess the present state of knowledge people have about the
probable vaccine for COVID-19, to know the preferences of respondents about this vaccine and
to learn the expectations and apprehensions of people about features of this prospective COVID19 vaccine residing in the capital city of India.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was conducted amongst the residents of Delhi, India from JulyOctober 2020. Both offline and online interview method was used to collect date from 513
participants representing various occupational strata. Data was collected on socio demographic
variable, vaccine acceptance and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccine.
Results
Among the study population 79.5% said they will take the vaccine while 8.8% said they were not
going to take the vaccine and remaining 11.7% had not yet decided about it. Most of
them(78.8%),believed that vaccine would be available to public next year but at the same time
half(50.1%) of them believe that it may not be in sufficient amount for everyone to get. More
than 50% were willing to pay for the vaccine and 72% felt vaccine should first be given to health
workers and high risk group.
Conclusion
The following study has helped to understand the percentage of people who are hesitant to take
the vaccine and also the concerns regarding the vaccine. Also since half of the population is
willing to pay for the vaccine, a strategical approach considering the various economical classes
of people could be applied in a developing country like India.

COVID-19, as we know today is one of the biggest challenge mankind has faced in the century.
The disease has jolted the entire world with more than 1 million deaths occurring worldwide.

[1]

India reported 88,74,290 cases and 1,30,519 deaths as on 17th Nov 2020.[2] There has been
extensive global efforts to combat the pandemic. Efforts in resource constrained setting like India
have also been multidimensional.

[3]

However, the disease has caused huge economic loss and

has left the entire world socially crippled.
As mentioned by various epidemiologists the virus is here to stay. In such situations acquiring
immunity against the virus becomes essential. Immunity can be acquired in two ways, either
naturally or through vaccine. In the current pandemic the role of safe and effective COVID-19
will be very vital in the fight against COVID-19.Progress and claims about the vaccine trials
have been mooted by several epidemiologist and medical experts, yet it is that opportunity which
mankind has nailed all his hope upon.

[4]

The present pandemic situation warrants a potential

accelerated timeline for development of vaccine with overlapping of phases and emergency use
authorization. [4] Till October end two vaccines have been approved. Also, the Moderna, m RNA
– 1273 and the AstraZeneca/Oxford – ChAdOxl nCoV-19 have already entered the phase III.
India’s candidate vaccines COVAXIN and ZyCov-D which are in the pathway of progress to be
able to deliver us immunity have moved over to phase II/III trials. Preliminary findings show a
vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech can prevent more than 90% of people from getting
Covid-19 and Moderna vaccine has claimed 94.5% efficacy in its interim analysis.[5] WHO
estimates a total cost of 8 billion USD to develop a suite of three or more vaccines having
different technologies and distribution to prevent COVID – 19 worldwide.

[6]

However, the

efficacy, frequency, safety, preferences and precautions are some such queries that every
individual whoever counts on the hope of vaccine advent, harbours in his mind.

Advent of any vaccine confronts plenty of issues. Based on prior studies about advent of other
vaccines, we could enumerate that hurdles occur at the level of Vaccine – like production,
manufacture, trials, marketing, safety and cold chain maintenance. Ethics and efficacy or
beneficiary – like acceptance, fear, compliance, willingness to pay, site predilection or an
apprehension for any adverse effects. Vaccine acceptance is a social tool which plays an
important role for advent, implementation and continuation of any vaccination programme. [7,8]
Accounting for the perception of people about vaccine advent will give empirical details about
their aspirations and apprehensions. Considering factors like willingness to pay will help in
considering the financial constraints and economies into consideration before a large scale bulk
production. Decisions like whom to administer first, where and how to administer, cost
constraints, willingness to come out to health facilities for getting the shots or volunteering to be
part of such trials will further ease the policy and programmatic commitments. Thus this study is
being conducted with the objectives to assess the present state of knowledge people have about
the probable vaccine for COVID-19, to know the preferences of respondents about this vaccine
and to learn the expectations and apprehensions of people about features of this prospective
COVID-19 vaccine residing in the capital city of India.

Materials and Methods
Study design, setting and participants
The cross-sectional quantitative study was carried out among the residents of Delhi, North India
from July-October 2020.
Various sections of society were taken.
Occupation such as: All staff in health work force including doctors, nurses, paramedics
and health workers

Staff in corporate sectors including engineers, technicians, managers and leaders etc
Business class including Shopkeepers, owners, delivery boys, Managers etc…
Education sector – who constitute a major chunk and play major role in taking care of
young ones like teachers, principal and tutors etc.
Sample size: In such a dynamic scenario where figures escalate and slump on a day to day basis,
considering the rule of assumptions a prevalence of 50 % was considered and Schwartz formula
was applied. At 90% power and 95% confidence interval, the sample size came out to be 400.
Considering a non-response rate of 10 %, sample size of 440 was obtained and further rounded
of to 500.A total of 513 participants responded.
Procedure
Respondents above 18 years of age, who consented, were included in the study, which was either
conducted physically as an interview or using online technique, depending on the respondent’s
convenience.
For the physical interview method, individuals were selected by simple random sampling from
among these strata’s so as to reach our estimated sample size. After a brief training, the
interviewer collected data from these subjects by a semi structured questionnaire which was pretested and expert validated.
Online method: For those individuals who consented but had time constraint, we wilfully
administered the questionnaire to them in Microsoft forms and awaited response from them via
the link provided. The terms not understood by them were clarified and explained to them over
phone. All terms of ethical consideration, beneficence, autonomy and confidentiality was
followed.

The questionnaire was semi structured and contained the socio demographic details, respondent’s
perception and knowledge about the prospective COVID-19 vaccine, questions regarding their
expectations, fears, barriers and apprehensions about such a vaccine. The last part included
questions regarding their promptness to be part of any such vaccine trials for the benefit of
mankind.
The questions were validated by experts and repeat consultations and modifications done as
required after an initial pilot study. A link was created to be able to reach professionals who
consented to be part of the study but owing to time constraint preferred to respond to it as per
their own convenience.

The preference of individuals for Vaccine in the terms of its availability, efficacy, intake and
cost; mounted on a likelihood scale with 1 depicting least likely and 6 depicting most likely was
taken up as the dependant variables. Socio-demographic details like age, caste, job profile,
knowledge about the vaccine’s safety, efficacy, time of advent, adequacy etc., the willingness to
be part of trial, preferences for route of administration, readiness to spend and take booster doses
were also analysed.
Data analysis:
The completed questionnaire was checked for completeness and consistency. Collected data was
entered in the MS Excel spreadsheet, coded appropriately and later cleaned for any possible
errors in a SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Studies) for windows version 21.0. Categorical
data was presented as percentage (%). Pearson’s chi square test was used to evaluate differences
between groups for categorized variables. In case, the expected cell count was found to be less

than 5 in >20% cells, we used the fisher’s exact test. Normally distributed data was presented as
means and standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All tests were performed at a
5% level significance, and thus the value less than 0.05 (p value < 0.05) was taken as significant
association.
Ethics statement
Permission to conduct the study was taken from the Research Proposal Advisory Committee and
approval was taken from the Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed consent in writing was
taken from respondents who participated through physical interview and online consent was
taken by participants who filled the form online. There were no conflict of interest and all
measures of autonomy and confidentiality were strictly maintained.

Results
A total of 513 participants responded. Amongst all the participants, almost equal participation
were there from male (50.9%) and females (48.3%). Most of the participants were middle aged
(41.7%), Hindu by religion (65.9%) and currently married (57.7%), Most of the study
participants (88.5%) were either in college or had completed college. Among occupation of
participants, most of them were health care workers like doctor/ nurse/ paramedic/ ANM
(42.7%), 23.2% were students, and rest were from other service sectors.
Based on the history of COVID-19 infection among the study participants, 2.5% had COVID-19
infection in the past, and 1.4% said there was mortality due to COVID-19 in their family.
Around three fourth had a moderate to strong feeling that they may catch the infection anytime,
while almost two third of those who had COVID-19 infection in past, think that re infection can
happen. Most of them were afraid of dying after getting COVID-19. (Table 1)

Figure 1 shows COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. It was observed that 79.5% would take the
vaccine whenever available, while 8.8% said they would turn it down and remaining 11.7% had
not yet decided about it. Figure 2 shows knowledge and attitude of study population about the
COVID-19 vaccine. Most of them believed that vaccine would be available to public next year
(78.8%), but at the same time half of them believe that it may not be in sufficient amount for
everyone to get (50.1%) and 52.4% did feel it will not prevent the COVID-19 disease for
lifelong. Majority knew that the COVID-10 vaccine would not prevent all types of pneumonia
(67.4%).
As per Table 2, the study shows that participants were willing to take COVID-19 vaccine by any
route in any number of doses, but preferably with a good effectiveness and rare side adverse
reaction. People were willing to get the vaccine even if they need to pay for it (84.4%), and had
to get vaccinated every year (75.6%).

Discussion
This study is first of its kind done in India with the objective to assess the knowledge,
preferences, expectations and apprehensions about the probable vaccine for COVID-19 among
residents of Delhi. It was observed that overall participants were quite aware about the COVID19 vaccine and likely to get a vaccine if it were available.
In this unprecedented COVID-19 situation, some stress and fear among participants about
catching the infection, being reinfected and concern of death due to the disease was also
observed. The country wide lockdown, infodemics, etc. may have precipitated this stress and
fear. About one-tenth of respondent had COVID-19 in their family, with mortality rate of 16.7%,
which are higher than the national estimates. [9]
Among the respondents, 79.5% were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if it is available,
11.7% were not sure at the time of survey while 8.8% refused to take it. This acceptability rates
in our study are higher in comparison to previous researches from other developing as well as
developed countries. A study from Nigeria reported acceptability at 29%, in Saudi Arabia it was
65%, in Indonesia it varied between 67 – 93%, while in China it was 72.5% among the general
population. [10, 11, 12, 13,] Among developed countries, a study in US reported 67% would accept a
COVID-19 vaccine, while researchers in France documented about 25% of respondents would
not use the vaccine when it is available.[14,15,16] The scepticism were also reported in Larson’s
Vaccine Confidence Project which documented one fifth of Swiss and 18% of French would
refuse a COVID-19 vaccine.[16] In a US poll, only half of the people said they will take a
COVID-19 vaccine and 20% turned it down, while in a UK poll the refusal rate was about one in
six.[17,18] A multicentric study conducted in seven European countries found acceptance rate at
73.9%, while 7.2% desired not to get vaccinated.[19] Another recent multicentric Ipsos survey,

conducted on behalf of the World Economic Forum, observer overall three-quarters of adults
agreed to get vaccinated when available. [20] In the same survey, India with 87% acceptance rate
were among countries where COVID-19 vaccination intent is highest.

[20]

The higher

acceptability in the study reflects good public confidence in COVID-19 vaccine. It may be due to
many reasons which are seen in Indian subcontinent. First, the overall immunization coverage
and vaccine acceptability in Indian is higher due efforts of government of India in collaboration
with UNICEF and GAVI in providing free as well as universal vaccination. Secondly, the
misinformation being spread by The Anti-Vaxx movement prevalent in developed countries are
not so common in India.

[21]

While good acceptance rate in our study is depicts the positive

attitudes towards a vaccine in India, we should also pay attention to portion who have not yet
decided. These are the potential candidates for intervention for increasing vaccination acceptance
among community.
In regards to factors effecting vaccine acceptance, it was observed the future COVID-19 vaccine
acceptance was relatively higher among younger age group (84.7% among 34 or lower), females
(82.7%), currently not married (87.1%), students (91.6) and participants with secondary
education level (84.4%). Except gender and education level, all these associations were
significant in statistical analysis. These finding were contrast to study from US and Saudi Arabia
where they observed acceptance higher among older adults.

demography, social structure and political engagement, the vaccine acceptance was also different
from our study, leading to different findings.
In the study, it was observed that people have mixed expectation from the research team working
on COVID-19 vaccine candidates. As high as two-fifth of the respondents were expecting the
vaccine to be released in India by end of this year for public use, while about 80% were

expecting to come by next year. These rates were similar to the one observed in multicentric
study where 59% disagreed that COVID-19vaccine would be available to them before the end of
2020.

[20].

While the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) claims of early release have

fuel this eagerness, it also creates doubts and pessimistic views of people about its efficacy and
safety.[22] This also reflects the desperation of the people to get vaccinated for COVID-19.
Although the respondents are eagerly waiting for vaccine, they knew that it would be far from
the perfect one. Most of them desired not to volunteer to participate in "human challenge" study
which could accelerate its development. More than half were in the view that vaccine would
provide lifelong immunity and it would not be sufficient for everyone when it will be available.
About one-third said it would not protect all alike, while some of the respondents were searching
alternatives to vaccine in homeopathy (12.3%) and Ayurveda (16.4%). Perception that vaccine
would not be sufficient for everyone and may not protect all with lifelong immunity, could affect
the vaccine acceptance rate in community. Although we observed handful proportion of sample
searching alternatives to vaccine, a recent report by Wellcome Trust observed that almost all
Indian (98%) agree that vaccines are important for children. [23]
In regards to vaccine preferences, most of the participants were open to all the forms of routes,
while about one third preferred injections over oral/inhalation. Almost one third were willing to
have any number of doses, while other one-third were only willing to take a maximum number
of three doses. The least accepted side effect for the participant was fainting (40%) and injection
site pain (25%). This finding is important concern for vaccine candidate profile because it has
been documented that most common reason for not getting covid-19 vaccine was concerned
about potential side effects.

[19,20]

Almost two-fifth would immunize themselves only if the

vaccine is at least 80-90% efficacious while rest one-fourth opt for at least 60% efficacy.

Similarly a study from Indonesia, reported 93.3% of respondents agreed for vaccination with
95% effective vaccine, but 67.0% accepted for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness.

[24]

Most of

them were willing to take the vaccine every year, and would pay for it too. Almost same
proportion of respondent were willing to pay100-500Rs, and between 500-2000Rs from their
pocket for the vaccine, while about 16% would be vaccinated only if it was provided for free.
These are similar to the findings from other developing country.

[24]

More than half of the

respondents said that they like to get the COVID-19 vaccine from any health facility, which
shows the community confidence in public health infrastructure, while confidence in vaccine
was displayed by almost all the respondents who had children and had fully vaccinated them.
Utilizing existing vaccine-distribution infrastructure is also preferred approach in planning
COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Indians have good trust in doctors and health system as reported
by recent report by Welcome Trust.

[23]

This is predominantly due to large numbers of

community health workers which again build the confidence of community in the health system.
This would be helpful in planning COVID-19 vaccination. Study from Saudi Arabia observed
acceptance for COVID-19 vaccine was three times if they have trusted the health system. [13] The
participants were aware that health care workers are the most at-risk population for getting
COVID-19, more than half advocated that health care workers should get the COVID19 vaccines
first, while there were few who said that the vaccine should be given to all at the same time. As a
low-middle-income country with limited health budget, India cannot run the rat race of vaccine
nationalism where developed countries are hedging their bets to secure potential vaccines
supplies to their citizen, our focus should be on establishing a framework for the equitable
allocation of Covid-19 vaccines including prioritizing high risk groups. [25]

Limitations: Only a sub sample of the population could be included in the study. Large scale
studies from whole of India are needed to understand the knowledge, expectation and
apprehension before the launch of the vaccine. Another limitation of the study was that it did not
have equal representative from various economic and occupational strata of society which could
bias the result.
Conclusion: The study shows that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy which is currently the concern
in other countries is not an issue in India. Also with the launch of vaccine, vaccine
misinfodemics will have to be tackled. As the country waits for the introduction of a vaccine
against COVID-19, this pre-introduction period provides a great opportunity to develop a
communication package to improve vaccine confidence in the community. This will help to
improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. This will also lead to overall immunization
programme strengthening, with scientific evidences, clear and consistent communication and
improved health literacy of both the community as well as the service providers
