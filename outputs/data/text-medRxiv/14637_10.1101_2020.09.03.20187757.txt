The role of school reopening in the spread of COVID-19
2 September 2020.
Richard Beesley

Abstract

Methods

Many countries chose to close schools as part of their
response to the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus (COVID-19)
pandemic. Whilst nations are gradually reopening schools,
and many politicians advise that schools remain safe and the
risks of increases in the spread of COVID-19 are low, little
evidence has been presented to confirm those statements.

The number of new daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 per
country1 was downloaded, up to 1 September 2020. From
this, seven-day rolling totals were calculated for each
country by day. This process removed variability in the data
that was due to some testing or analysis centres not
operating at full capacity every day of the week, which is the
case in some countries. The difference in monitoring and
tracking between countries is noted, although data from
each country is analysed separately so these differences are
less critical.

A review of the numbers of new confirmed COVID-19 cases
by country suggests that the reopening of schools is likely to
be a driver in the increase of the number of new cases. This
is likely exacerbated by accompanying changes and easing of
restrictions. However, with the exception of China, notable
for its robust test, track, trace, and isolate processes, no
other countries that had significant numbers of COVID-19
cases have successfully reopened schools without an
increase in cases as a consequence.
Whilst reopening of schools following an initial peak and
decrease in COVID-19 infections is desirable for a range of
reasons, doing so without adequate controls and
protections may lead to an exacerbation of spread within
the school environment, which could then lead to increased
community spread of disease.

Introduction
To date, the SARS-Cov2 coronavirus infection (COVID-19)
has infected over 26 million individuals worldwide, and been
responsible for over 860,000 deaths globally. Whilst our
understanding of the route for spread of the virus has
developed, the role of specific aspects of our communities is
not yet fully understood. Many countries closed schools and
colleges early in the outbreak of COVID-19 in an effort to
reduce the spread. Some have since re-opened schools,
although this may have contributed to an increase in the
number of confirmed infections. Many governments have
claimed that school reopening either has not, or will not,
lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases, yet have produced
little evidence to support that claim.
This paper is based on a review of publicly available national
data from countries that have experienced substantial
numbers of COVID-19 cases to assess the potential role of
reopening schools in the spread of the virus and increases in
numbers of cases.

The final analysis includes countries that experienced a
seven-day total of at least 5,000 new cases on at least one
day since they started recording COVID-19 cases, where
there is at least one clear wave or peak in cases (whether
this has been followed by a second peak or not). This cut-off
was selected because small numbers of cases can easily
adversely affect and mask overall trends.
Countries were excluded if the initial wave of COVID-19
cases remains ongoing, if the data was highly variable
(suggesting inconsistencies in case or data management), or
if disparate schooling systems and dates are used
throughout the country making analysis of national data
meaningless (such as the USA).
For each country included, an initial analysis of the sevenday rolling total number of new cases was plotted over time.
Alongside this we reviewed information about school
closures due to COVID-19, school reopening, and school
holiday dates. This data was acquired from national
education departments and mainstream media; where
media articles were used to identify school closure and
reopening dates they were verified using multiple
independent sources.
Since re-opening schools, some countries have closed
individual schools or those in specific areas to control the
spread of the virus. These cases are not included in the
analysis presented here.
For clarity, reopening of schools for the purposes of this
analysis includes only in-person teaching on-site. Remote,
distant and web-based teaching is excluded because, by
their very nature, they do not increase the risk of
transmission of COVID-19.

Findings
Our analysis identifies 4 main patterns in which the policy
decision and timing of school closures and reopening is
mapped onto the total number of new cases, and two
potential impacts – cases increase, or cases do not increase
(Figure 1Error! Reference source not found.).
A.

Schools have closed and not reopened. The total
number of cases is therefore not related to school
openings. These countries can be further divided into
two – those where the number of cases has started to
rise again (A1), and those where the number of cases
has remained low (A2).

B.
C.

D.

Schools reopened before or during an initial or
ongoing increase in cases.
Schools reopened after an initial wave of cases had
reduced. Again, these countries can be further divided
into two – those where the number of cases has
started to rise again (C1), and those where the number
of cases has remained low (C2).
Schools did not close.

totals).

In countries where schools were closed and have not yet reopened,
there are two distinct patterns.
Three countries (Ireland, Italy and Turkey) have seen an increase in
the number of cases despite not reopening schools (Figure 2). These
examples highlight that increases cannot exclusively be down to
schools reopening, but due to a more complex mix of societal factors.
Lifting of restrictions on groups of people meeting and travelling, and
an increase in holidays (both within the country and with visitors from
elsewhere) may have contributed to the rise seen.

reopened them, yet have seen an increase in cases. Line is shown as a percentage of the
maximum for each country to give comparability, based on the 7-day rolling total number
of new confirmed COVID-19 cases.

In contrast five countries that have not reopened schools have not
seen an increase in cases (Figure 3). This may be due to reduced intercountry tourism, coupled with a less prominent easing of restrictions.

them, and have not seen an increase in cases. Line is shown as a percentage of the
maximum for each country to give comparability, based on the 7-day rolling total number
of new confirmed COVID-19 cases.

One country (Egypt) within the analysis reopened schools before the
initial wave of cases had peaked; two others (Portugal and Romania)
reopened schools whilst a subsequent increase in cases was ongoing.
As a result, any impact of school reopening is masked by the overall
increase in cases (Figure 4).

when cases were already increasing. Line is shown as a percentage of the maximum for
each country to give comparability, based on the 7-day rolling total number of new
confirmed COVID-19 cases. Date of school reopening is indicated by a triangle.

The majority of countries within the analysis have reopened schools
following an initial peak in cases. Only one of these (China) has seen
a sustained low number of cases (Figure 5). This is likely due to their
robust and rapid response to suspected and confirmed cases of
COVID-19, including widescale testing within the community, strict
isolation measures, and immediate closure of schools with a potential
outbreak.

of COVID-19 as a result. Line is shown as a percentage of the maximum for each country
to give comparability, based on the 7-day rolling total number of new confirmed COVID19 cases. Date of school reopening is indicated by a triangle.

Most countries that have reopened schools after an initial peak have
seen a further rise in cases. Of these, the number of days between
schools reopening and the start of the increase in cases ranged from
24 to 47 days, with a mean of 36·5 days (Figure 6 and Table 1).

One country adopted a fundamentally different approach. Sweden
chose not to close schools during their initial outbreak, and politicians
from that country have announced that keeping schools open did not
lead to an increase in cases. However, it is notable that schools in
Sweden closed for the summer on 9 June; the reduction in cases
(based on the seven-day rolling total) started to reduced 23 days later
(Table 2 and Figure 7). This timescale is within the range identified for
increases in cases after schools did reopen in other countries. As a
result, it is arguable that keeping schools open may have contributed
to an ongoing spread of the disease.

Interpretations
In many countries that closed schools during the initial increase in
cases of COVID-19, reopening after the number of cases reduced is
associated with a new increase in cases. The different patterns seen
in case loads matched against school reopening dates and processes
indicate a number of contributory causes. However, the spread of the
virus through schools and then into the community does appear to
contribute to overall numbers of cases.
Where schools have not yet reopened, the indication is that the
spread of the virus depends on a number of other factors. We
hypothesise that these include the lifting of other restrictions and
increased internal and into-country tourism. Thus, where these
changes have taken place and tourism and travel have increased
(including from areas and countries with higher underlying rates of
COVID-19 infection), local numbers have started to increase. This is
seen in Ireland, Italy and Turkey. By comparison, countries where
schools have remained closed but other restrictions and inter-country
travel remains limited, cases have not increased.
Countries which have reopened schools, either in full or in part, give
a useful insight into the role schools may play in spreading the virus.
The increases seen are greater than would be expected from the
lifting of travel restrictions alone. Given the narrow timeframe in
which cases rose after schools reopened, it is indicative that the
reopening of schools contributed to the increase in cases. Further,
countries that had more limited opening (Canada, Spain, United
Kingdom) had a longer lead-in before the increase in cases. Similarly,
Singapore, which introduced substantial controls to limit the spread
of the virus within school communities, had a longer lead-in time (42

days) than other countries. Those countries that opened schools fully
with limited controls saw a shorter lead-in time before an increase in
cases.
Sweden is unique, in that it did not close schools. However, they are
a strong example of the impact of closing schools, with a substantial
reduction in cases starting 23 days after schools closed for the
summer holiday period.

Discussion
Schools form one part of our dynamic, diverse and complex
communities. It is not possible to entirely separate the role of schools
in the spread of the virus from other factors, notably because
reopening of schools leads to parents returning to workplaces, other
family members taking on care responsibilities (such as
grandparents), and is often accompanied by easing of other
restrictions (including travel, shops and leisure activities). It is
therefore very difficult to specify with certainty that school reopening
alone is responsible for an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases
within a community.
However, given each of the countries that has reopened schools
within this research have seen an increase in cases (with the
particular exception of China), and this increase is greater than that
seen in countries that have kept schools closed, it is apparent that
school reopening and the associated changes in society and
community transmission does play a part in COVID-19 spread.
In addition, the onset of summer holidays has exacerbated the spread
of the virus, masking in part the direct effects of schools. However,
school reopening does seem to have an impact. In Scotland and
Northern Ireland, schools reopened around 2 weeks before England.
Within those two weeks, 53 schools had reported outbreaks, with 106
students and teachers infected, and 19,000 in quarantine.
In the UK, adequate spacing and ventilation within classrooms is
largely impossible. Masks are optional in many schools, and not
permitted in others or in certain situations. Published risk
assessments and controls within schools focus on fomite rather than
droplet transmission, largely ignoring aerosol transmission of the
virus, and relying on symptoms to isolate infected individuals. Given
many carriers of the virus do so asymptomatically, this approach
appears futile. As a result, it seems likely that an increase in viral cases
will become apparent within the coming weeks in the UK.
China is an example of effective use of controls, track, trace and
isolation to restrict the spread of the virus. Without those controls,
the spread of the virus appears inevitable, exacerbated by school
opening and travel of infected people.
Whilst reopening of schools following an initial peak and decrease in
COVID-19 infections is desirable for a range of reasons, doing so
without adequate controls and protections may lead to an
exacerbation of spread within the school environment, which could
then lead to increased community spread of disease.
