89 Abstract
90 Background: COVID-19 can course with respiratory and extrapulmonary disease. SARS91 CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory samples but also in blood, stool and urine. Severe
92 COVID-19 is characterised by a dysregulated host response to this virus. We studied
93 whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma are associated to severe COVID-19
94 and also to this dysregulated response.
95 Methods: 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalised
96 ward patients, and 100 critically ill). Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was
97 performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2
98 nucleoprotein gene. The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load
99 in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Correlations
100 between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were
101 evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients.
102 Results: the frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78%)
103 compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p<0.001). Critical patients had
104 higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non survivors
105 showing the highest values. When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral
106 RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis. In contrast,
107 when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA
108 load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95%], p): RNAemia (3.92
109 [1.183 - 12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244 - 3.096], 0.004); viral RNA
110 load (N2) (2.229 [1.382 - 3.595], 0.001). Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher
111 levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory
112 response (IL-6, CRP, Ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction
113 (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue

114 damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM115 CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia).
116 Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated to
117 critical illness in COVID-19. Viral RNA load in plasma correlates with key signatures of
118 dysregulated host responses, suggesting a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the
119 pathogenesis of this disease.

139 Background
140 With well over 43 million cases and 1.56212 deaths globally, Coronavirus disease 2019
141 (COVID-19) has become the top economic and health priority worldwide [1]. Among
142 hospitalized patients, around 10–20% are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), 3–10%
143 require intubation and 2–5% die [2]. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is commonly detected in
144 nasopharyngeal swabs; however viral RNA can be found in sputum, lung samples,
145 peripheral blood, serum, stool samples, and to a limited extent urine [3] [4] [5] [6]. While
146 the lungs are most often affected, severe COVID-19 also induce inflammatory cell
147 infiltration, haemorrhage, and degeneration or necrosis in extra-pulmonary organs (spleen,
148 lymph nodes, kidney, liver, central nervous system) [7] [8]. Patients with severe COVID149 19 show signatures of dysregulated response to infection, with immunological alterations
150 involving moderate elevation of some cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-10 or
151 CXCL10, deep lymphopenia with neutrophilia, systemic inflammation (elevation of C
152 Reactive Protein, ferritin), endothelial dysfunction, coagulation hyper-activation (D153 dimers) and tissue damage (LDH) [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14].
154 Our hypothesis is that systemic distribution of the virus or viral components could be
155 associated to the severity of COVID-19, and, in turn to a number of parameters indicating
156 the presence of a dysregulated response to the infection.
157 While the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported to be difficult to culture from blood [4],
158 PCR based methods are able to detect and quantify the presence of genomic material of the
159 virus in serum or plasma, representing an useful approach to evaluate the impact of the
160 extrapulmonary dissemination of viral material on disease severity and also on the host
161 response to the infection [5] [15]. An excellent approach for achieving absolute
162 quantification of viral RNA load is droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). ddPCR is a next-

163 generation PCR method, which offers absolute quantification with no need of standard
164 curve and greater precision and reproducibility than currently available qRT-PCR methods,
165 as revised elsewhere [16].
166 We employed here ddPCR to detect and quantify viral RNA in plasma from COVID-19
167 patients discharged from the emergency room with mild severity, patients admitted to the
168 ward with moderate severity, and critically ill patients. Our objectives in this study were:
169 1) to evaluate if there is an association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA
170 load with moderate disease; 2) to evaluate if there is an association between SARS-CoV-2
171 RNAemia and viral RNA load with critical illness; 3) to evaluate the correlations between
172 SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in plasma and parameters of dysregulated host responses against
173 SARS-CoV-2.

184 Methods
185 Study design: 250 adult patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain
186 reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 performed at participating hospitals were recruited
187 during the first pandemic wave in Spain from March 16th to the 15th of April 2020. The
188 patients recruited were of three different categories. The first corresponded to patients
189 examined at an emergency room and discharged within the first 24 hours (outpatients
190 group, n=50). The second group were patients hospitalized to pneumology, infectious
191 diseases or internal medicine wards (wards group, n=100). Patients who required critical
192 care or died during hospitalization were excluded from this group, in order to have a group
193 of clear moderate severity. The third group corresponded to patients admitted to the ICU
194 (n=100). Patient`s recruited by participating hospital are detailed in the additional file 1.
195 20 healthy blood donors were included as controls. These controls were recruited during
196 the pandemics, in parallel to the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and were negative for
197 SARS-CoV-2 IgG. This study was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov with the identification
198 NCT04457505.
199 Blood samples: Plasma from blood collected in EDTA tubes samples was obtained from
200 the three groups of patients in the first 24 hours following admission to the emergency
201 room, to the ward, or to the ICU, at a median collection day since disease onset of 7, 8 and
202 10 respectively, and also. from 20 blood donors (10 men and 10 women).
203 Biomarker profiling: a panel of biomarkers was profiled by using the Ella-SimplePlex™
204 immunoassay (San Jose, California, U.S.A), informing of the following biological
205 functions potentially altered in severe COVID-19, based in the available evidence on
206 COVID-19 physiopathology [13] [17] and also in our previous experience on emerging
207 infections and sepsis [18] [19] [20] [21]: neutrophil degranulation: Lipocalin-2/NGAL,
208 myeloperoxidase; endothelial dysfunction: ICAM-1, VCAM-1/CD106, Angiopoietin 2; T

212 granulocyte mobilization / activation: G-CSF, GM-CSF; coagulation activation: D-Dimer;
213 acute phase reactants: Ferritin (C Reactive protein and LDH were profiled in each
214 participant hospital by their central laboratories).
215 Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma: RNA was extracted from
216 100 µl of plasma using an automated system, eMAG® from bioMérieux® (Marcy l'Etoile,
217 France). Detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed in five µl of
218 the eluted solution using the Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR kit according to
219 manufacturer’s specifications on a QX-200 droplet digital PCR platform from the same
220 provider. This PCR targets the N1 and N2 regions of the viral nucleoprotein gene and also
221 the human ribonuclease (RNase) P gene using the primers and probes sets detailed in the
222 CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel [22].
223 Samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 when N1 and/or N2 presented values
224 ≥ 0.1 copies/µL in a given reaction. RNase P gene was considered positive when it
225 presented values ≥ 0.2 copies/µL, following manufacturer`s indications. The test was only
226 considered valid when RNase P gene was positive. Final results were given in copies of
227 cDNA / mL of plasma. IgG specific for the Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS–CoV-2 was
228 detected in 150 µl of plasma using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay (Illinois,
229 U.S.A). Viral RNA and SARS-CoV-2 IgG were profiled in the same plasma sample.
230 Statistical analysis: For the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, the
231 differences between groups were assessed using the Chi-square test / Fisher's Exact Test
232 where appropriated for categorical variables. Differences for continuous variables were
233 assessed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc tests adjusting for multiple

234 comparisons. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the
235 association between viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity, in the
236 comparisons [outpatients vs ward patients] and [ward patients vs ICU patients]. Variables
237 showing significant differences between groups in each comparison in the Kruskal-Wallis
238 test were further introduced in the multivariate analysis as adjusting variables. The list of
239 variables considered as potential adjusting variables were [Age (years)], [Sex (male) ],

249 [Neutrophils (cells/mm3)], [Monocytes (cells/mm3)]. Multivariate logistic regression
250 analysis was performed using the “Enter” method, but also the backward stepwise
251 selection method (Likelihood Ratio) was employed in each case to confirm the association
252 between viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with disease severity (pin < 0.05,
253 pout < 0.10), not forcing entry of these variables in the model. Correlation analysis were
254 performed using the Spearman test applying the Bonferroni correction of the p value.
255 Variables evaluated for correlation with viral RNA load were: [Temperature (ºC)],
256 [Systolic Pressure (mmHg)], [Oxygen saturation (%)], [Lymphocytes (cells/mm3)],
257 [Neutrophils (cells/mm3)], [Monocytes (cells/mm3)], [Creatinine (mg/dl)], [LDH (UI/L)],

259 analyzed by Ella- SimplePlex. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS® version
260 20 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA).
261 Results
262 Clinical characteristics of the patients (Table 1): Patients requiring hospitalization
263 (either general ward or ICU) were older than those patients discharged to their home from
264 the ER. Critically ill patients were more frequently male than those in the other groups.
265 Comorbidities of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes were more
266 commonly found in patients requiring hospitalization, with no significant differences found
267 in the comorbidities profile between critically ill and non-critically ill hospitalized patients.
268 14% of the patients in clinical wards required non-invasive mechanical ventilation, while
269 96% of the patients admitted to the ICU required invasive mechanical ventilation.
270 Critically ill patients had increased glucose levels, along with higher concentration of
271 neutrophils in blood, increased levels of ferritin and C-reactive protein (denoting activation
272 of the systemic inflammatory response). Increased levels of INR and D-dimers (reflecting
273 activation of the coagulation system), as well as LDH and GPT, which levels raise as
274 consequence of tissue and liver damage, were also observed in critically ill patients.
275 Patients admitted to the ICU also showed a lower haematocrit, pronounced lymphopenia
276 and lower monocyte counts at admission. ICU patients stayed longer in the hospital than
277 ward patients, with 49 % having a fatal outcome.
278 Viral RNAemia, viral RNA load in plasma and specific SARS-Cov-2 IgG in the three
279 groups of patients. As depicted in table 1, the frequency of the detection of SARS-CoV-2
280 viral RNA (RNAemia) was significantly higher in the critically ill patients (78%)
281 compared to ward patients (27%) and outpatients (2%) (p<0.001). Similarly, the group of
282 critically patients showed higher viral RNA loads in plasma than either ward or outpatients
283 (p<0.001) (Table 1 and Figure 1). Non survivors showed the highest concentrations of viral

287 survivors: 2798 copies / ml [12012]; viral RNA load (N2 region) in ICU survivors 523
288 copies / mL [1478]. Patients admitted to the wards showed a significant higher frequency
289 of viral RNAemia than outpatients, but viral RNA loads were not significantly different
290 with the latter group (Table 1 and Figure 1). Critically ill patients also had a higher
291 frequency of specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses than the other groups (70% in ICU
292 compared to 52% and 49% in the outpatients and ward groups, p < 0.05, table 1). No
293 significant differences were found between the group of outpatients and those admitted to
294 the ward. The prevalence of viral RNAemia did not differ between those patients testing
295 positive and those testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG (43.8 % and 40.4 % respectively,
296 p =0.586), who in addition showed no differences in viral RNA load (data not shown).
297 Patients with viral RNAemia showed no differences in the days since onset of symptoms
298 compared to those with no viral RNAemia (8.0 days [6.0]; 8.0 days [7.2], p = 0.965). In
299 contrast, samples from patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG were collected later since disease

302 RNA load in plasma with moderate disease and critical illness. While the proportion of
303 patients with viral RNAemia was higher in the wards group compared to the outpatients’
304 group (table 1), the multivariate analysis did not show a significant association between the
305 presence of viral RNAemia and being hospitalised at the ward, with none of the both
306 methods employed (Additional files 2 and 3). In contrast, when the ward group was

308 viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in critically ill patients, using the “Enter” method
309 (Table 2) but also the backward stepwise selection method (additional file 4).
310 Correlations between viral RNA load in plasma and biological responses to SARS311 CoV-2 infection: viral RNA load in plasma (targeting either the N1 and the N2 regions)
312 showed the strongest direct correlations with plasma levels of CXCL10, LDH, IL-10, IL-6,
313 IL-15, myeloperoxidase and CCL-2 (MCP-1) and inverse correlations with lymphocytes,
314 monocytes and O2 saturation (Figure 2). These were the parameters whose levels varied
315 the most in critically patients compared with ward and outpatient groups (Figures 3 and 4
316 and additional file 5). CXCL10 was the most accurate identifier of viral RNAemia in
317 plasma (area under the curve (AUC), [CI95%], p) = 0.85 [0.80 – 0.89), <0.001), and IL-15
318 was the cytokine which most accurately differentiated clinical ward patients from ICU
319 patients (AUC: 0.82 [0.76 – 0.88], <0.001). Plasma viral RNA load also showed significant
320 direct correlations with levels of VCAM-1, PDL-1, GM-CSF, G-CSF, neutrophil counts,
321 IL-1ra, CRP, INR, D-dimer, TFNα, Angiopoietin-2, GPT, ICAM-1, IL-7 and Ferritin
322 (Figure 2), with most of these mediators showing the highest variations in the critically ill
323 patients (Figures 3 and 4 and additional file 5).
324 Discussion
325 Our study demonstrates that the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA in plasma is associated to
326 critical illness in COVID-19 patients, with the strength of association being the highest in
327 those patients with the highest viral RNA loads. This association was independent of other
328 factors also related to disease severity. Moreover, those critically ill patients who died
329 presented with higher viral RNA loads in plasma than those who survived. SARS-CoV-2
330 viral RNA was detected in the plasma of the vast majority of those COVID-19 patients
331 admitted to the ICU (78%). As far as we know, our study is the largest one to date using
332 ddPCR to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in plasma from COVID-19 patients, and the

333 only one with a multicentric design. Our results are in consonance with those from Veyer
334 et al, who, in a pilot study using this technology, found higher viral RNA loads and a
335 prevalence of RNA viremia of 88% in twenty six COVID-19 patients who were critically
336 ill [16]. The results are also in agreement with those of Hagman et al, who, using standard
337 RT-PCR technology, found that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum at hospital
338 admission was associated with a seven-fold increased risk of critical disease and an eight339 fold increased risk of death in a cohort of 167 patients hospitalised for COVID-19 [23].
340 Although our study did not determine if the presence of viral RNA in plasma reflects the
341 presence of live virus in peripheral blood, the association found between the presence and
342 concentration of viral RNA in plasma and critical illness suggests that viral replication is
343 more robust in severe COVID-19, and/or that critically ill patients with this disease are not
344 able to control viral replication. This notion is further supported by the correlations found
345 in our study between viral RNA load in plasma and hypercytokinemia involving CXCL10,
346 IL-10, CCL2, IL-6 and IL-15, where the levels of these cytokines were the highest in
347 patients with critical illness. The correlation between viral RNA load and higher levels of
348 cytokines has also been described in the severe infections caused by H5N1 and pandemic
349 H1N1 influenza strains [24] [25]. Active viral replication stimulates the secretion of
350 cytokines by the recognition of viral RNA by endosomal receptors such as toll like
351 receptor 7 (TLR7) in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells, or TLR8 in myeloid
352 cells [26]. While the elevation of CXCL10, IL-10, CCL2, IL-6 has been extensively
353 documented in severe COVID-19 [9] [10], our work demonstrates a clear correlation
354 between these cytokines and plasma viral load. Furthermore, we report for the first time a
355 major role of IL-15 in severe COVID-19. High levels of IL-15 in critically ill patients with
356 high SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in plasma could be an attempt to stimulate Natural Killer
357 cells to fight the virus [27]. We previously demonstrated that high levels of IL-15, along

358 with IL-6, constituted a signature of critical illness in H1N1 pandemic influenza infection
359 [20].
360 Viral RNA load correlated with higher levels of myeloperoxidase in plasma, which were
361 the highest in those patients admitted to the ICU. This is a marker of neutrophil
362 degranulation and a potent tissue damage factor which has been proposed to play a role in
363 the pathogenesis of ARDS secondary to influenza, by mediating claudin alteration on
364 endothelial tight junctions, eventually leading to protein leakage and viral spread [28]. In
365 this regard, the correlation found between viral RNA load in plasma and higher levels of
366 LDH and GPT could suggest a direct or indirect role of viral replication in mediating tissue
367 destruction in COVID-19.
368 Interesting, but less robust, direct correlations were found between viral RNA load in
369 plasma with GM-CSF and neutrophil counts in blood, further reinforcing the role of
370 neutrophil mediated responses in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. The direct
371 correlation with soluble PDL-1 is also relevant, since this the ligand of the inhibitory
372 co‑receptor PD1 on T cells, which activation induces anergy of T lymphocytes [29]. This
373 finding reinforces the potential role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in severe COVID-19
374 [30]. In turn, the association found between viral RNA load in plasma and three mediators
375 of endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin 2 and ICAM-1), and with coagulation
376 activation markers (D-dimers and INR prolongation) suggests a potential virally linked
377 mechanism in the pathogenesis of endothelitis and thrombosis in COVID-19 disease [7].
378 Finally, the correlation with the acute phase reactants CRP and ferritin suggests a
379 connection between shedding of genomic material of the virus to the blood and the
380 induction of a systemic inflammatory response which is observed in those patients needing
381 critical care.

382 The strongest inverse correlations found in our study was between SARS-CoV-2 RNA
383 load in plasma and lymphocyte and monocyte counts in peripheral blood, for which
384 critically ill patients showed the lowest values. Active viral replication could be a
385 precipitating event in the pathogenesis of lymphopenia and monocytopenia in severe
386 COVID-19 patients [11] [31], by mediating direct cytopathic actions or stimulating the
387 migration of these cells to the extravascular space to reach the infected tissues [32].
388 A limitation of our work is its observational nature, which precludes to infer causality.
389 Nonetheless, the observed associations could serve as hypothesis generators, leading to the
390 development of animal models to confirm the potential link between SARS-CoV-2
391 replication and the dysregulated host responses observed in severe COVID-19.
392 Conclusion:
393 Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma is associated with critical illness in patients with
394 COVID-19. The strength of this association increases with viral RNA load in plasma,
395 which in turn correlates with key signatures of dysregulated host response in COVID-19
396 (figure 5). Our findings suggest a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the
397 pathogenesis of this disease. Assessment of viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma
398 could be useful to early detect those patients at risk of clinical deterioration, to assess
399 response to treatment and to predict disease outcome.
