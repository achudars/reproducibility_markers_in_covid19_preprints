Abstract
In this work, a researcher develop SHEIQRD (Susceptible-Stay at home-ExposedInfected-Quarantine-Recovery-Death) coronavirus pandemic spread model. The
disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are calculated and analyzed. The
basic reproductive number R0 is derived and its sensitivity analysis is done.
COVID-19 pandemic spread is die out when R0 ≤ 1 and its persist in the community whenever R0 > 1. Efficient stay at home rate, high coverage of precise
identification and isolation of expose and infected individuals, and redaction
of transmission and stay at home return rate can be mitigate the pandemics.
Finally, theoretical analysis and numerical results are consistent.

1. Introduction
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals
or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory
infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle
East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes Coronavirus disease

2019( COVID-19) [1]. Its the infectious disease caused by the most recently
discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the
outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have
aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure, most commonly around five
days [2, 3].
China was the index case of COVID-19 pandemic later it rapidly spread
thought the world. People infected by those initial cases spread the disease to
other drastically due to human to human transmission [4]. Although Corona
represents a major public health issue in world, as of March 11, 2020, over
118,000 infections spanning 113 countries have been confirmed by the World
Health Organization (WHO). The WHO declared this public health emergency
as a pandemic [5]. As of 14 April 2020, WHO reported 1, 844, 863 confirmed
case and 117, 021 deaths have been recorded globally [6].
The study about the spread and control of COVID-19 is essential at this
time. Different scholars are study about infectious disease spread control by
using modeling approach [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Recently, researcher study a bout
COVID-19 [13, 14, 15, 16]. The model, which is of SEIR form [17], incorporates the recommended public health interventions in the current pandemic.
The recommended mitigation strategies of the pandemic are stay at home, and
isolation of expose and infected individuals by efficient identification process. A
researcher focus on the impact of control measures by varying the parameter values. The model result indicates that the containment of the pandemic requires
high level of both identification and isolation process and the contact tracing
process by stay at home for removing infected individuals from the susceptible
population.

2. Model Formulation
In this work a researcher consider that the total population is N (t) at time
t. The whole population dividing in to seven compartments. The susceptible
population S(t), they stand for people who are capable of becoming infected.
The quarantine population H(t), they represent people who are stay at home.
The exposed population E(t), they represent people who are incubating the infection. The spreader population I(t), they represent people who are infectious
infected. The quarantine population Q(t), they represent people who are isolated by clinically confirmation. The recovery population R(t), they represent
people who are discharge from the virus. The density of disease induced death
denoted by D(t).
The model flows chart is describes in figure 1.

In the process of COVID-19 spreading, the spreading among these seven
states is governed by the following assumptions. It is assumed that β is the contact rate of susceptible individuals with spreaders and the disease transmission
follows the mass action principle. A researcher assume that susceptible individuals home quarantine or stay at home at the rate θ. And at a rate θ0 staying at
home is not fully protected from the virus due to ineffectiveness of home quarantine. The one who completed incubation period becomes to infected at a rate
of σ, that means

σ

is the average duration of incubation. According to clinical

examination, the exposed and infected individuals becomes isolated at a rate

of η and α respectively. It is assumed that the infectious infected individuals,
leading to disease prevalence. The average duration of infectiousness is γ1 , when
γ is the transmission rate from infected to recovery or death. In my assumption
recovery from isolated infected is better than and infected class due to clinical
treatment. Infected and isolated infected are recover with a probability of κ1
and κ2 , and also they will becomes to death with a probability of (1 − κ1 ) and
(1 − κ2 ) respectively. The parameter Λ is the recruitment, while µ natural birth
and death rate of each state individuals. The parameters are all non-negative.
Based on the above considerations, COVID-19 spreading leads to dynamic
transitions among these states, shown in figure 1. The model can be described
by the following system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations:

= βu(t)w(t) − (σ + η + µ)v(t),
= σv(t) − (α + γ + µ)w(t),
= ηv(t) + αw(t) − (γ + µ)q(t),

= (1 − κ1 )γw(t) + (1 − κ2 )γq(t) − µd(t),

From the normalized form of the model we have to get
u(t) + h(t) + v(t) + w(t) + q(t) + r(t) + d(t) = 1.
Now, the first equation of the system (2) can be reduced and we hold six system
of differential equations
v 0 (t) = βw(t) (1 − h(t) − v(t) − q(t) − w(t) − r(t) − d(t)) − φv(t),
w0 (t) = σv(t) − ξw(t),

h0 (t) = θ (1 − h(t) − v(t) − q(t) − w(t) − r(t) − d(t)) − (µ + θ0 )h(t)
where φ = (σ + η + µ) and ξ = (α + γ + µ).
So, the feasible domain of the system (3) is

Γ = (h, v, w, q, r, d) ∈ R6+ |h + v + w + q + r + d ≤ 1 .
For the well-posedness of the model, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 1. The set Γ is positively invariant to system (3).

Proof. Denote x(t) = (h(t), v(t), w(t), q(t), r(t), d(t))T and then system (3)
can be rewritten as
dx(t)
= f (x(t)),
dt
where
f (x(t)) = [θ (1 − h(t) − v(t) − q(t) − w(t) − r(t) − d(t)) − (µ + θ0 )h(t),
βw(t) (1 − h(t) − v(t) − q(t) − w(t) − r(t) − d(t)) − φv(t),

κ1 γw(t) + κ2 γq(t) − µr(t), (1 − κ1 )γw(t) + (1 − κ2 )γq(t) − µd(t)]T .
Note that Ω is obviously a compact set. We only need to prove that if x(0) ∈ Γ,
then x(t) ∈ Γ for all t ≥ 0. Note that ∂Γ consists of five plane segments:
P1 = (h, v, w, q, r, 0)|h, v, w, q, r ∈ [0, 1], h + v + w + q + r ≤ 1,
P2 = (h, v, w, q, 0, d)|h, v, w, q, d ∈ [0, 1], h + v + w + q + d ≤ 1,
P3 = (h, v, w, 0, r, d)|h, v, w, r, d ∈ [0, 1], h + v + w + r + d ≤ 1,
P4 = (h, v, 0, q, r, d)|h, v, q, r, d ∈ [0, 1], h + v + q + r + d ≤ 1,
P5 = (h, 0, w, q, r, d)|h, w, q, r, d ∈ [0, 1], h + w + q + r + d ≤ 1,
P6 = (0, v, w, q, r, d)|v, w, q, r, d ∈ [0, 1], v + w + q + r + d ≤ 1,
P7 = (h, v, w, q, r, d) ∈ R6+ |, h + v + w + q + r + d = 1,
which have v1 = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, −1), v2 = (0, 0, 0, 0, −1, 0), v3 = (0, 0, 0, −1, 0, 0), v4 =

hf (x(t))|x∈p1 , v1 i = − ((1 − κ1 )γw(t) + (1 − κ2 )γh(t)) ≤ 0,
hf (x(t))|y∈p2 , v2 i = − (κ1 γw(t) + κ2 γq(t)) ≤ 0,

The proof is complete.
Hence, system (1) is considered mathematically and biologically well posed in
Γ[18].

3. Theoretical analysis of the model

In this sub section, we show the feasibility of all equilibria by setting the
rate of change with respect to time t of all dynamical variables to zero. The

3.3. Stability of the disease free equilibrium
In this subsection, we summarize the results of linear stability of the model
(2) by finding the sign of eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix around the equilibrium E0 .
Theorem 2. If R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium E0 of system (2) is locally
asymptotically stable, and it is unstable if R0 > 1.
Proof. In the absence of the disease, the model has a unique disease free
equilibrium E0 . Now the Jacobian matrix at equilibrium E0 is given by:

Here, we need find the eigenvalue of the system from the Jacobian matrix
(4). We obtain the characteristic polynomial
P (λ) = (λ + γ + µ)(λ + ψ) (λ + µ)


λ2 + (φ + ξ)λ + φξ(1 − R0 ) .

(5)

From the characteristic polynomial in equation (5), it is easy to get five real
negative eigenvalues of J(E0 ), which are λ1,2,3 = −µ, λ4 = −µ−γ and λ5 = −ψ.
We get the other real negative eigenvalues from the expression
λ2 + (κ + ξ)λ + κξ(1 − R0 ).

(6)

From the quadratics equation (6), we conclude that λ6,7 are positive if R0 > 1
and negative if R0 < 1. Thus, the equilibrium E0 is locally asymptotically
stable if R0 < 1. E0 becomes unstable whenever E ∗ is feasible (i.e., R0 > 1).
The proof is complete.

Physically speaking, theorem 2 implies that disease can be eliminated if the
initial sizes are in the basin of attraction of the DFE E0 . Thus the infected
population can be effectively controlled if R0 < 1. To ensure that the effective
control of the infected population is independent of the initial size of the human
population, a global asymptotic stability result must be established for the DFE.

Theorem 3. If R0 ≤ 1, then the disease-free equilibrium, E0 , of system (2) is
globally asymptotically stable in Γ.
Proof. Let X = (u, h, v, w, q, r, d)T and consider a Lyapunov function,
V(X) = σv + φw.
Differentiating V in the solutions of system (2) we get
V̇ = σ v̇ + φẇ,

R0 ≤ 1. It establishes the basic reproduction number R0 as a sharp threshold
parameter. Namely, if R0 < 1, all solutions in the feasible region converge to

the DFE E0 , and the disease will die out from the community irrespective of
the initial conditions. If R0 > 1, E0 is unstable and the system is uniformly
persistent, and a disease spread will always exist.
3.4. Endemic equilibrium and its stability
3.4.1. Existence and uniqueness
The feasibility of the equilibrium E0 is trivial. Here, we show the feasibility of
endemic equilibrium E ∗ . The values of u∗ , h∗ , v ∗ , w∗ , q ∗ , r∗ and d∗ are obtained
by solving following set of algebraic equations:
µ − βu(t)w(t) − (θ + µ)u(t) + θ0 h(t) = 0,
βu(t)w(t) − φv(t) = 0,
σv(t) − ξw(t) = 0,
ηv(t) + αw(t) − (γ + µ)q(t) = 0,

κ1 γw(t) + κ2 γq(t) − µr(t) = 0,
(1 − κ1 )γw(t) + (1 − κ2 )γq(t) − µd(t) = 0,

Therefore, there exists a unique positive solution only when R0 > 1. This
implies that, it has a unique endemic equilibrium, E ∗ .

The polynomial (9) has negative roots (eigenvalues) if all its coefficients terms

we can verify that c1 > 0, c4 > 0, c1 c2 − c3 > 0 and c3 (c1 c2 − c3 ) − c21 c4 > 0,
when R0 > 1. Therefore, according to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, we can get
that all the roots of the above characteristic equation have negative real parts.
Thus, the endemic equilibrium asymptotically stable. The proof is complete.
The local stability analysis of the endemic equilibrium tells that if the initial
values of any trajectory are near the equilibrium E ∗ , the solution trajectories

approach to the equilibrium E ∗ under the condition R0 > 1. Thus, the initial
values of the state variables u, h, v, w, q, r and d are near to the corresponding
equilibrium levels, the equilibrium number of infected individuals get stabilized
if R0 > 1.
3.5. Sensitivity analysis of R0
We explore R0 sensitivity analysis of system (2) to determine the model
robustness to parameter values. This is a strategy to identify the most significance parameters of the model dynamics. The normalized sensitivity index Υλ
is given by

From the sensitivity indices calculation results, we can identify some parameters that strongly influence the dynamics of disease spread. Parameters β, θ0
and σ have a positive influence on the basic reproduction number R0 , that is,
an increase in these parameters implies an increase in R0 . While parameters
µ, η, α, θ and γ have a negative influence on the basic reproduction number R0 ,
that is, an increase in these parameters implies a decrease in R0 .
Here, we illustrate graphically the relationship between the basic reproductive number and the parameters in model (2).
A researcher can find some interesting results, which have been showed in
figure 2, and figure 3, it can be seen that big β or σ can lead to large R0 . That is
to say, the larger contact or short incubation period can increase the opportunity
of disease spreading. If we reduce the transmission rate by quarantine or any
appropriate control measure, then the disease outbreak will end.

As a result of figure 4, and figure 5, R0 decreasing when θ increases, and
increases whenever θ0 increase respectively. This finding suggested that effective
stay at home intervention have been mitigates the COVID-19 spread, conversely
the ineffectiveness of this intervention measure can rising its spread.
Figure 6, and figure 7, shows that the increment of η or α can reduce R0 .
That is to say, effective quarantine of incubated and infectious individuals can
reduce the opportunity of disease spreading.
From figure 8, and figure 9, we find that, short average time from the symptom onset to recovery or death γ and large value of µ can reduce the COVID-19
spread.

In this section, we conduct numerical simulation of the model (2) by using
Matlab standard ordinary differential equations (ODEs) solver function ode45.
4.1. General dynamics
We numerically illustrate the asymptotic behavior of the model (2). We
take the the initial conditions u(0) = 0.9, q(0) = 0, v(0) = 0.06, w(0) =
0.04, h(0) = 0, r(0) = 0, and d(0) = 0.
Figure 10 presents the trajectories of model (2) when β = 0.05, θ = 0, σ =
0.1923, α = 0, γ = 0.0714, µ = 0.01, θ0 = 0.0, thus the basic reproduction
number R0 = 0.5842. From this figure, we can see that the disease die out and

This mean that disease disappears in the community as shown in theorem 2,
and theorem 3. Furthermore, socio-economical crisis caused by COVID-19 are
removed. Finally, we have to get disease free community.

in time. This means that the trajectories converge to the endemic equilibrium

4.2. Impact of the transmission rate
In order to investigate the impact of the transmission rate on the spread
of COVID-19, we carry out a numerical simulation to show the contribution of
transmission rate β in fractional infection population density.

Figure 12: Impact of transmission rate β on infected population w(t) in system (2). Colors

We set the transmission rate β as 0.05, 0.2, 0.25, 0.35 and β = 0.5. From
figure 12, we can observe that infectiousness reach a higher peak level as β
increases. This figure illustrates the great influence of transmission rate as shown
in the sensitivity analysis. The transmission rate and the basic reproductive
number are almost symmetrical relationship (i.e R0 = 10×β). It says that, if we
implemented effective contact tracing process between infected and susceptible
population, then the transmission rate is reduced and also the disease spread
will be eliminated. The main public health measure which are implemented
to reduce the transmission rate in the current pandemic are stay at home and
quarantine or isolation of exposed and infected individuals by clinical tests.

4.3. Impact of public health intervention
Study the recommended containment strategies of the pandemic, we conduct
some numerical simulations to show the contribution of public health interventions.
One of the recommended control measure to reduce the pandemic is quarantine or isolation. Here, we observe the isolation of exposed and infected
individuals within different rate:

Now, we set the exposed population isolation rates η as 0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and
0.0. In figure 13, we can see that the infectiousness increase as η decrease. This
implies that effective isolation of exposed individuals by clinical identification
before the symptom onset can mitigates the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly,
infected isolation rates α set as 0.25, 0.1, 0.05, 0.03 and 0.0. In figure 14, we observe that the infectiousness density approaches to highest peak level as α value
decreases. This implies that ineffective quarantine of symptomatic individuals
can lead the prevalence of the pandemic.
In the current critical time the public health experts and government officials
announced that every individuals must stay at home. Due to food security and
ineffectiveness of stay at home peoples my lose this recommendation. To observe
the impact of stay at home efficiency and its lose in the following numerical

can’t implement effectively this control measure, then people becomes to susceptible at a rate of θ0 . To show its impact with θ = 0.1, we chose different θ0
values as 0.6, 0.24, 0.013, 0.0065 and 0.0. We can be see in figure 16, the disease
spread rises as θ0 values increases. This implies if we can’t stay at home with a
recommended time span, then we lead the pandemic prevalence.

Conclusions
In this paper, a researcher investigated the dynamics of the COVID-19
spreading with control measure. An SHEIQRD Corona pandemic model with
public health intervention has been presented, and analyzed theoretically as will
as numerically. The theoretical analysis of the model are done. An essential
epidemiological parameter value R0 is derived by using the next generation matrix approach. Furthermore, we have shown that the disease free equilibrium
globally asymptotically stable if R0 ≤ 1 and unstable otherwise. For the case
where R0 > 1, the exists a unique endemic equilibrium E ∗ , which is locally

asymptotically stable. The sensitivity analysis of basic reproductive number
was conducted. Its result suggested that transmission rate β, isolation rates η
and α, stay at home rate θ and stay at home return rate θ0 are the basic control
parameter of the model.
Numerical simulations are conducted aim to support theoretical analysis
and shows the significance of public health intervention to containment these
pandemics. The general dynamics of the model with time is illustrated that the
disease is die out when R0 ≤ 1 (see figure 10), but its persists in the community
whenever R0 > 1 (see figure 11). Moreover, socioeconomically crisis caused
by these pandemic can be minimized and eliminated when we implemented
appropriate control measure.
Also of importance in mitigation of the pandemics are reduced a transmission rate β (see figure 12) and the stay at home return rate θ0 , an efficient
identification and isolation of exposed and infected individual with rate of η
and α (see figures 13, 14) respectively, and enhance the ability of stay at home
rate θ (see figure 15). Finally, robust public health intervention end the current
pandemic and minimizing crisis caused by these outbreak.
