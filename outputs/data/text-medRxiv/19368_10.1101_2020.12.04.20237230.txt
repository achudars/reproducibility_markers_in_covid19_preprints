Abstract
The use of magnetic beads in the extraction of nucleic acids from wastewater is presented as an
approach to simplify extraction techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral fragments in
wastewater. In particular, this paper describes the development and optimization of a direct
method for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from municipal wastewater using magnetic beads. The
recovery efficiency of the method using Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 Positive Reference Material
(ASCV-2) was examined. Method factors assessed were sample volume, concentration of
magnetic bead mix, elution temperature, and water matrix (deionized (DI) water and
wastewater). The combination of optimized method parameters that resulted in the highest RNA
recovery in both DI water (26.0 ± 0.8%) and wastewater (11.8 ± 1.4%) was a sample volume of
1.0 mL, a magnetic beads concentration of 100 µL mL-1 sample, and an elution temperature of 60
°C. The performance of this optimized method was further assessed in recovery experiments
using wastewater samples spiked at 1.8x106 and 1.8x104 gene copies L-1 (GU L-1) with Gamma
Inactivated SARS-COV-2 (GI-SCV-2) and 1.0x106 and 1.0x104 infectious units L-1 of Human
Coronavirus 229E (HCV 229E) as viral surrogates. Recoveries of 86.1 and 4.6% were achieved
for wastewater samples spiked with GI-SCV-2 at low and high concentrations, respectively. In
assessing the effects of wastewater pre-filtration and addition of DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT, used to
inactivate RNases that may degrade RNA) on recovery efficiency of ASCV-2, the magnetic
bead-based extraction protocol performed optimally with unfiltered wastewater without DTT
(recovery = 17.4 ± 0.4%). The method limit of detection (MLOD) for ASCV-2 recovered from
pre-filtered wastewater was determined to be 4.6x104 GU L-1 (95% degree of confidence). Using
this optimized magnetic bead-based extraction protocol, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
verified in wastewater collected from sewershed locations in Atlantic Canada. This emerging
RNA extraction method is direct, rapid, and does not require the use of specialized equipment,
thus offering advantageous application for laboratories with limited resources. As such, this
method is an indispensable tool in the monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 to potentially
understand COVID-19 infection occurrence within communities and inform public health
leaders.

1. INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory

82

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide and has claimed the lives

83

of over 1.3 million people as of 20 November 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020). SARS‐

84

CoV‐2 is an enveloped, positively charged, single‐stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus (60 to

85

140 nm) of the beta coronavirus genus (Tian et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Although COVID-19

86

is characterized as a respiratory illness, many infected patients also present with gastrointestinal

87

distress (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). Data from faecal and respiratory specimen analyses

88

suggest that SARS-CoV-2 virus particles survive longer in the gastrointestinal tract than in the

89

respiratory tract (Tian et al., 2020). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in feces of

90

both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (Ahmed et al., 2020a). As such, the

91

monitoring of wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 viral fragment occurrence to investigate the

92

prevalence of COVID-19 infections in a given population has been gaining momentum as the

93

pandemic continues to spread (Carducci et al., 2020; Foladori et al., 2020; Gonzalez et al., 2020;

94

Kumar et al., 2020).

95

Reliable tests for SARS-CoV-2 infections target the viral genome through quantitative

96

reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) (Bustin and Nolan, 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020). The use

97

of RT-qPCR led to the first report of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in untreated wastewater in a

98

proof-of-concept study that demonstrated the applicability of wastewater surveillance for

99

COVID-19 as a tool to understand infection rates within communities (Ahmed et al., 2020a). To

100

effectively monitor SARS-CoV-2 viral fragment occurrence in wastewater, the development of

101

an efficient and reliable methodology for viral fragment recovery from this complex matrix is

102

paramount.

103

For most techniques, SARS-CoV-2 analysis in wastewater requires pre-concentration of the

104

sample. Among the most common methods of virus concentration in wastewater are

105

ultrafiltration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, and ultracentrifugation (Ahmed et al.,

106

2020c, 2020a; La Rosa et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020;

107

Wurtzer et al., 2020). Most of these RNA concentration methods are cost-ineffective, time-

108

consuming, and labour-intensive (Ahmed et al., 2020c). Moreover, information on the recovery

109

efficiencies of current methods for measuring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is limited (Ahmed et

110

al., 2020c; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020), as most studies use surrogates (e.g. murine hepatitis

111

virus (MHV), MS2 (an F-specific RNA phage), and other coronaviruses), to perform recovery

112

efficiency studies (Ye et al., 2016). Green et al., 2020 reported a 12% recovery of inactive

113

SARS-CoV-2 from 20-mL samples of wastewater using ultracentrifugation.

114

In the last decade, several studies have demonstrated the use of magnetic beads to extract

115

nucleic acids from a variety of matrices, including serum (Sun et al., 2014), urine (Shan et al.,

116

2012), sputum (He et al., 2017), whole blood (Albertoni et al., 2011), tissue (Mathot et al., 2011),

117

and wastewater (La Rosa et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2019). While conventional approaches involve

118

both pre-concentration and extraction using magnetic beads, an emerging methodology involves

119

direct extraction using magnetic beads in the absence of a pre-concentration step. The advantages

120

of direct RNA extraction via magnetic beads are that the procedure is rapid, cost-effective, and

121

does not require the use of specialized equipment. Direct RNA extraction also increases viral

122

recovery efficiency, as pre-concentration methods often significantly reduce overall recovery

(Gonzalez et al., 2020), and allows for larger reaction volumes, potentially bridging the gap

124

between pre-concentration sample volumes and traditional extraction sample volumes. Such

125

advantages allow for greater diversity in monitoring applications, which is valuable for

126

laboratories with limited resources. This study advances the application of magnetic bead

127

extraction approaches through the development of a new method optimized for direct, rapid

128

extraction of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater. Here we report the recovery efficiency of the

129

method using deionized water and municipal wastewater spiked with different viral surrogates

130

and heat- and gamma-inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

147

Wastewater sample collection and preparation
Wastewater samples were collected from three communities in Atlantic Canada:

148

Community A (grab sample from one sewershed site and influent 24-h composite samples from

149

two WWTFs), Community B (grab samples from the pump station and influent and effluent of

150

the WWTF [two-cell aerated lagoon with disinfection using chlorine gas]), and Community C

151

(sewershed grab samples at two locations and WWTF influent 24-h composite samples).

152

Samples were collected in volumes of at least 100 mL and transported to Dalhousie University

153

on ice. For each sample, an aliquot of 45-mL was transferred to a 50-mL centrifuge tube and

154

kept at 4 °C for up to 24 h. The wastewater aliquot was seeded with Accuplex SARS-CoV-2

155

Positive Reference Material to yield a concentration of 1x106 gene copies L-1 (GU L-1). The

156

spiked sample was mixed thoroughly and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min prior to RNA extraction.

157

All samples were stored overnight at 4 °C and processed the next morning for RNA extraction

158

and RT-qPCR analysis.

159

Additional wastewater samples were provided by the Winnipeg Wastewater Treatment

160

Plant (WWTP) (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) to assess the RNA extraction method for the

161

recovery and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 surrogates spiked at different concentrations. The

162

grab wastewater samples were spiked with high (1.8x106 ± 2.0 x105 GU L-1) and low (1.8x104 ±

163

2.0 x103 GU L-1) concentrations of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 NR-52287 (GI-SCV-2) and

164

high (1.0x106 infectious units L-1) and low (1.0x104 infectious units L-1) concentrations of

165

Human Coronavirus 229E ATCC® VR-740TM (HCV 229E). Viral surrogates were obtained from

the University of Alberta and were spiked at the National Microbiology Laboratory. The seeded

167

wastewater was shipped to Dalhousie University on ice, and the samples were analysed within

168

48 h of seeding. The wastewater was kept at 4 °C during transport and throughout the

169

preparation of spiked samples.

2.3

Determination of RNA extraction conditions with magnetic beads using a factorial design

171

A screening statistical design was chosen to establish optimal conditions for the RNA

172

extraction of ASCV-2 from wastewater and maximum recovery efficiency for the RT-qPCR. Thus,

173

a full-factorial design of four factors was used to assess the magnetic bead-based extraction

174

protocol in RNA extraction. All experiments were performed according to the experimental design

175

shown in Table 1. A total of 16 experimental runs were carried out randomly to limit the occurrence

176

of potential bias. The four independent variables in this study were ASCV-2 spiked sample volume

177

(mL) (x1), concentration of magnetic beads (µL mL-1 sample) (x2), RNA elution temperature (°C)

178

(x3), and water matrix (DI water and wastewater) (x4). The dependent variable was evaluated as

179

ASCV-2 recovery efficiency (%), calculated based on the number of copies quantified for each

180

experimental run by RT-qPCR using Equation 1:

Each seeded sample was prepared by spiking ASCV-2 in either DI water or wastewater to

186

a concentration of 1x106 GU L-1, as described in section 2.2 Wastewater sample collection and

187

preparation. All RNA extractions were performed with reagents provided by LuminUltra

188

Technologies Ltd (Fredericton, NB, CA). In a 15-mL centrifuge tube, 4.9 or 6.5 mL of Lysis

189

buffer was added to 1 or 2.5 mL of spiked water sample, vortexed for 30 sec, and immediately

190

incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. A volume of 3.5 mL EtOH was added to the lysed sample; the

191

tube was gently inverted several times to mix thoroughly and then spiked with binding beads at a

192

concentration of either 15 or 100 µL per mL of sample. The mixture was vortexed for 30 sec and

193

incubated again at 30 °C for 10 min. The magnetic beads were precipitated by applying a

194

magnet, and the supernatant was discarded. The magnetic beads were transferred to a 2-mL

195

microcentrifuge tube and washed three times with 1 mL of Wash I solution. A second wash step

196

using 1 mL of Wash II solution was carried out three times. For each wash, the magnetic beads

197

were vortexed for 30 sec, and the supernatant was discarded after magnet precipitation of the

198

beads. Once washed, the tubes containing the magnetic beads were placed at room temperature

199

with the caps off for approximately 1 h to evaporate residual EtOH. Then, 50 µL of elution

200

buffer (preheated to 30 or 60 °C) was added to the magnetic beads. The tube was vortexed for 30

201

sec and incubated at either 30 or 60 °C for 5 min. Finally, the magnet was applied to ensure

202

separation, and the elution buffer was collected into a sterile tube for analysis. Controls without

203

seeded ASCV-2 were prepared to identify background concentrations of the virus in wastewater.

Laboratory (as described in section 2.2 Wastewater sample collection and preparation). A total

219

of three aliquots of 100 mL for each surrogate spike condition were prepared. Moreover, a

220

negative control was added to assess the background concentration of both surrogates in the

221

wastewater. For RNA extraction, each of the aliquots for every surrogate spike condition was

222

processed in duplicate with the optimal parameters of 1 mL sample volume, 100 µL of magnetic

223

beads per mL of sample, and RNA elution temperature of 60 °C. Following extraction, RNA was

224

quantified by RT-qPCR and the recovery efficiency of each surrogate spike condition was

225

calculated.

227

Assessing matrix effects of wastewater on RNA recovery
The effect of the wastewater matrix in the magnetic bead-based extraction protocol was

228

studied to improve RNA recovery efficiency. Wastewater seeded with ASCV-2 was processed

229

using two different strategies: filtration pre-treatment and addition of DTT (~1 M) to the lysis

230

buffer. For the first approach, wastewater was pre-treated by filtering through a 0.45-µm pore

231

membrane to remove particulates that may saturate the magnetic beads. A sample spiked with

232

1x106 GU L-1 of ASCV-2 was passed through a 47-mm diameter mixed cellulose ester

233

membrane via a sterile magnetic filter funnel (Pall Corporation, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada)

234

and filtration flask. The filtrate was immediately collected into a sterile conical tube and used for

235

RNA extraction. The second strategy involved the addition of DTT (~1 M) during the lysis step

236

to inactivate RNases that may degrade RNA. DTT was added to the lysis buffer and spiked

237

wastewater (filtered and non-filtered) at a concentration of 20 mM.

238
239

A total of four experiments were performed in triplicate to assess the effect of wastewater
pre-filtration and addition of DTT on RNA recovery efficiency using the magnetic bead-based

240

extraction protocol. Viral RNA extraction and quantification was carried out using the optimal

241

parameters identified by the experimental design: 1 mL sample volume, 100 µL of magnetic

242

beads per mL of sample, and RNA elution temperature of 60 °C.

243

2.6

244

RT-qPCR assay
RNA samples were processed by RT-qPCR on a GeneCount® Q8 instrument (LuminUltra

245

Technologies Ltd, Fredericton, CA). The sequences for primers and probes published by US

246

CDC used in this study are shown in Table 2 (CDC, 2020). For the detection of SARS-CoV-2,

247

the RT-qPCR amplifications were performed in 20-µL reactions using the GeneCount SARS-

248

CoV-2 Screening kit (LuminUltra Technologies Ltd, Fredericton, CA), which contained 15 µL

249

of Master Mix and 5 µL of template RNA. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene DNA plasmid

250

was used as a positive control. Thermal cycling reactions were carried out as follows: a pre-

251

denaturation step at 55 °C for 10 min followed by a second pre-denaturation step at 95 °C for 1

252

min; 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 sec and 55 °C for 45 sec; and a final hold step at 50 °C for 1 min.

253

Reactions were considered positive when cycle threshold (Ct) values were below 40. The upper

254

Ct value detection threshold for the RT-qPCR was 40 cycles corresponding to 1.4 copies per

255

reaction.

256

For HCV 229E, a previously published Taq-Man based RT-qPCR assay was used (Vijgen

257

et al., 2005). HCV 229E RT-qPCR analyses were performed in 10-µL reaction mixtures using

258

TaqManTM Fast Virus one-step Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA). The reaction mixture

259

contained 2.5 µL of Master Mix, 10 µM of forward primer, 10 µM of reverse primer, 10 µM of

260

probe, 1.5 µL of PCR grade water, and 5 µL of template RNA. Thermal cycling conditions

261

consisted of RT at 50 °C for 5 min, enzyme activation at 95 °C for 20 sec, and 45 cycles of 95 °C

Method Limit of Detection (MLOD) determination

268

The method limit of detection (MLOD) of the optimized RNA extraction method was

269

calculated using ASCV-2 spiked into wastewater that was pre-filtered as described in Section 2.5

270

Assessing matrix effects of wastewater on RNA recovery. The synthetic RNA was seeded into

271

pre-filtered wastewater in a series of decreasing concentrations (1x103 to 1x106 GU L-1). All

272

diluted solutions were subjected to the optimized RNA extraction method and assessed by RT-

273

qPCR in six replicates. Before adding ASCV-2, the wastewater sample was analyzed for the

274

presence of SARS-CoV-2 to obtain background levels. The percentage of replicates that resulted

275

in a positive detection for each dilution were compared to the spiked virus concentration, and the

276

data were fitted to a Gompertz model (Tjørve and Tjørve, 2017). Using this model, the dilution

277

reporting the lowest non-negative concentration at a 95% confidence level was selected as the

278

MLOD.

Application of the RNA extraction method for the detection and quantification of SARS-

281

CoV-2 in wastewater

282

The application of the RNA extraction and RT-qPCR methods were evaluated in raw

283

wastewater samples from three locations in Atlantic Canada. In Fall 2020, wastewater samples

284

were collected from Communities A, B, and C over five, eight, and four sampling events,

285

respectively. RNA fragment extraction was carried out using the optimal parameters identified

286

by the experimental design: 1 mL sample volume, 100 µL of magnetic beads per mL of sample,

287

and RNA elution temperature of 60 °C.

Quality control
To minimize contamination, RNA extraction and RT-qPCR assays were carried out in

291

separate laboratories. A method blank was included during RNA extraction to account for any

292

contamination during sample processing. The extracted RNA was stored at –76 °C and subjected

293

to RT-qPCR within the same day of extraction.

All analyses were performed at least in duplicate. Results were expressed as average

297

values ± standard deviation and were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a 95%

298

confidence level. The response variable in the full-factorial design was modeled as a linear

299

combination of the main effects and two-way interactions, and residuals were approximately

300

Gaussian and homoscedastic. For experiments assessing the effect of wastewater matrix on

301

recovery efficiency, Tukey’s test for post-hoc analysis was used to evaluate group pairings that

302

were significantly different. The MLOD was assessed by plotting percent positive results against

the known spiked ASCV-2 concentrations in the series of MLOD test wastewater samples. A

304

best fit Gompertz model was fitted to the data, and the MLOD was calculated from the equation

305

generated from the best fit model when the value of percent positive (y-axis) was 95%. All

306

statistical analyses were performed using R studio software v. 3.6.2 (‘easynls’, ‘ggplot2’,

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

309

3.1

310

Effects of RNA extraction parameters on recovery efficiency
The effects of sample volume, concentration of magnetic beads, and elution temperature

311

on ASCV-2 RNA recovery in DI water and municipal wastewater were assessed through a

312

factorial experimental design (Table 3). The combination of optimized method parameters from

313

the full-factorial design that resulted in the highest RNA recovery in both DI water (26.0 ± 0.8%)

314

and wastewater (11.8 ± 1.4%) was a sample volume of 1.0 mL, a magnetic beads concentration

315

of 100 µL mL-1 sample, and an elution temperature of 60 ºC. Overall, ASCV-2 recoveries were

316

clearly influenced by the water matrix with values ranging from 1.3 to 11.8% for wastewater and

317

6.3 to 26.0% for DI water. To better visualize the influence of the factors on RNA recovery, a

318

response surface contour plot illustrating the relationship among the dependent (sample volume,

319

bead mix concentration, elution temperature, and water matrix) and independent (% recovery)

320

factors was generated (Figure 2). It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in

321

any of the unseeded wastewater samples.

The factorial experimental design demonstrated that a lower sample volume of 1 mL

330

resulted in consistently higher mean RNA recoveries than did a sample volume of 2.5 mL when

331

assessed at the same conditions for all other variables. The effect calculated from the linear

332

model showed that increasing the volume from 1 to 2.5 mL decreased recovery by 3.3x104 GU

333

L-1. These results suggest that a larger volume may have diluted the concentration of magnetic

334

beads and decreased contact between the beads and RNA. Thus, using smaller sample volumes

335

allowed more bead-RNA collisions and subsequent binding of RNA onto the magnetic beads,

336

which was reflected in higher recovery yields (Yuan et al., 2019).

considerably larger sample volumes. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all of 54

345

untreated Detroit wastewater samples following RNA concentration from 45-L sample volumes

346

(Miyani et al., 2020). Ahmed et al., (2020b) reported “small volumes” of wastewater for RNA

347

extraction as samples consisting of 50 mL, which is 50-fold greater than the optimal volume

348

determined in this study. Working with smaller wastewater sample volumes is advantageous, as

In recent comparable wastewater studies, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from

349

they are easier and safer to handle, store, and transport. While this method performs optimally at

350

low sample volumes (1 mL), it does not incorporate a concentration step, indicating that it is

351

suitable for wastewater samples that contain SARS-CoV-2 in concentrations present above its

352

method detection limit.

353

Pre-concentration of RNA in wastewater does not necessarily result in a higher recovery

354

efficiency. Gonzalez et al., (2020) compared the recovery efficiency of Bovine coronavirus

355

(BCoV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) from concentrated and unconcentrated

356

wastewater at a sample volume of 2 mL. Two concentration techniques were used: concentrating

357

pipette with centrifugation and electronegative filtration. Interestingly, recoveries of the

358

surrogates without concentration were 59 and 75% for BCoV and BRSV, respectively, while

359

neither concentration technique resulted in recoveries above 7.6% for either surrogate. This

360

reduced recovery observed by Gonzalez et al., (2020) was attributed to numerous workflow

361

concentration steps.

362

The concentration of magnetic beads added to the sample also greatly impacted RNA

363

recovery, as the beads play a primary role in the binding of target nucleic acids. Certainly, a

364

greater concentration of magnetic beads provides additional surface area, allowing for more

365

binding sites for nucleic acids (Yuan et al., 2019). A magnetic beads concentration of 100 µL

366

mL-1 sample resulted in significantly higher RNA recovery efficiencies (about 60 and 70%

367

increases in recovery from wastewater and DI water, respectively) than did a concentration of 15

368

µL mL-1 sample. Furthermore, when magnetic beads were dosed at a concentration of 100 µL

369

mL-1 sample, the recovery efficiency was maximized at low sample volume and minimized at

370

higher sample volumes. The effect of this factor calculated from the linear model showed that
18

371

increasing the concentration of magnetic beads from 15 to 100 µL mL-1 sample increased

372

recovery by 5.7x104 GU L-1. These results support our initial premise that a larger sample

373

volume may dilute the concentration of magnetic beads, which leads to lower RNA recoveries.

374

In agreement with our observations, Yuan et al., (2019) found that although smaller sample

375

volumes contain less total nucleic material, increased collisions between magnetic beads and

376

target nucleic acids produced higher recoveries, while larger sample volumes diluted the

377

concentration of magnetic beads and impaired eDNA recovery.

378

In both matrices, increasing the elution temperature from 30 to 60 °C resulted in a 60%

379

greater RNA recovery. The effect of elution temperature calculated from the linear model

380

showed that an increase from 30 to 60 °C increased recovery by 5.7x104 GU L-1. Previous

381

studies have outlined the important role of temperature for the desorption of nucleic acids

382

(Elaissari et al., 1999; Li et al., 2011, 2012). Nonetheless, there is a lack of consensus as many

383

methods are performed at room temperature (He et al., 2017; La Rosa et al., 2010; Sun et al.,

384

2014), whereas other studies have demonstrated that more RNA is released at increased

385

temperatures. For example, high temperatures have been reported to weaken the hydrogen bonds

386

formed between nucleic acids-adsorption materials, therefore, serving as an ideal tool to enhance

387

the elution process (Li et al., 2011). However, it should be considered that high elution

388

temperatures (>60 ºC) may increase the risk of RNA denaturation. In our preliminary

389

experiments, recovery efficiency increased considerably when RNA was eluted at 55 ºC in

390

comparison to room temperature (data not shown), and it was further improved by incubating at

391

60 ºC. It is likely that the short incubation periods used in this work in combination with the pre-

392

heated elution buffer promoted the solubilization of extracted RNA while minimizing RNA

393

degradation.

394

Of all four factors assessed in the factorial design recovery experiments, the matrix showed

395

the largest impact on RNA recovery. The effect of the matrix calculated from the ANOVA

396

showed that extracting RNA from wastewater (rather than DI water) decreased recovery by

397

7.8x104 GU L-1. The higher recovery yields obtained with DI water demonstrated the effect of

398

the complex composition of wastewater on the performance of the magnetic bead-based

399

extraction protocol. RNA recovery efficiency can be influenced by the matrix when the

400

particulate and dissolved components in the wastewater are carried along with the target virus

401

during isolation (Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020). As RNA extraction was performed for raw

402

wastewater without any pre-treatment, it is likely that debris and solids present in the matrix

403

competed with nucleic acids for binding sites on the magnetic beads (Huggett et al., 2008). Due

404

to this reduced surface area, lower quantities of RNA were able to bind to the magnetic beads in

405

the wastewater than in DI water.

406

In addition to the influence of physical interactions, the impact of the matrix on the

407

performance of the magnetic beads and virus recovery may also have a biochemical nature. It is

408

well known that the large variety of organic and inorganic molecules in wastewater can inhibit

409

the RT-qPCR process by reducing its sensitivity. These compounds, commonly referred to as

410

PCR inhibitors (Acharya et al., 2017), may be co-concentrated with the virus during the

411

processing of large sample volumes for the detection of low viral concentrations (Ahmed et al.,

412

2020d). In this work, the degree of inhibition was expected to be lower, as samples were not pre-

413

concentrated prior to RNA extraction. Nonetheless, inhibition was assessed by comparing Ct

414

values obtained for wastewater samples to those obtained for DI water samples (reference value).

415

Samples having Ct values greater than two cycles above the reference point were considered to

416

be impacted by PCR inhibition (Ahmed et al., 2020b). In these experiments, the difference

417

between the wastewater Ct value and the reference value for DI water was less than two cycles,

418

which suggests low inhibition from the wastewater matrix. These results may be attributed to

419

small sample volumes used for RNA extraction (1 to 2.5 mL). For example, Hata et al. (2011)

420

observed that the use of larger sample volumes (8.0 to 200 L) was associated with a greater

421

inhibitory effect. Conversely, other studies have observed no trends in PCR inhibition with

422

respect to sample volume for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR (Gibson et al., 2012; Medema et al.,

423

2020). As such, further research is necessary to elucidate the effect of wastewater matrix on the

424

performance of magnetic beads to enhance the recovery of ASCV-2.

425

3.2

Minimizing effects of the wastewater matrix on RNA recovery

426

The results for assessing the impacts of pre-filtration and the addition of DTT on

427

wastewater matrix effects are shown in Table 4. Treatment A (unfiltered wastewater without DTT)

428

provided the highest mean ASCV-2 recovery of 17.4%. The second highest mean recovery (16%)

429

was for treatment C, filtered wastewater without DTT. Overall, the addition of DTT in treatments

430

B and D showed similar results with slightly lower mean recovery yields compared to those

431

obtained with unfiltered and filtered wastewater only. Tukey’s test for post-hoc analysis showed

432

that the mean recovery efficiency of treatment A was significantly different than that of treatment

433

D (p < 0.05).

The complex diversity in chemical and biological composition of wastewater can impede

440

accurate detection of viruses in these samples. In addition to high suspended solids and organic

441

matter concentrations, raw wastewater usually contains compounds such as polysaccharides, metal

442

ions and RNases which are common PCR inhibitors (Corpuz et al., 2020; Michael-Kordatou et al.,

443

2020; Schrader et al., 2012). Particularly, the abundance of RNases can significantly compromise

444

the stability of RNA throughout the extraction and purification steps. As RNase activity requires

445

its disulfide bond to be intact, denaturation of the enzyme can be achieved through addition of

446

reducing agents, such as DTT, during lysis (Lu and Chang, 2010). In this study, the recovery of

447

ASCV-2 was not improved with the addition of DTT to either filtered or unfiltered wastewater. It

448

is possible that the concentration of DTT (20 mM) spiked into the lysis buffer was insufficient to

449

reduce the disulfide bonds in RNase, as previous investigations have shown that concentrations of

450

40 to 100 mM led to the effective inactivation of these proteins (Lu and Chang, 2010; Rogacs et

451

al., 2012). However, in a recent study that evaluated the reproducibility and sensitivity of 36

452

methods to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater, neither the removal of solids from the

453

sample nor the addition of a concentration step demonstrated a clear impact on recovery efficiency

454

(Pecson et al., 2020).

Recovery of gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 and HCV 229E surrogates in wastewater
The optimized magnetic bead-based extraction protocol was evaluated for recovery of GI-

457

SCV-2 and HCV 229E as SARS-CoV-2 surrogates in wastewater. Overall, the method allowed

458

differentiation between high and low concentrations, and non-spiked wastewater samples.

459

Neither of the two surrogates were detected in the negative samples. Mean concentrations of

460

8.33x104 ± 7.8x103 GU L-1 and 1.55x104 ± 3.6x103 GU L-1 were recovered for samples spiked at

461

high and low concentrations of GI-SCV-2.

462

In preliminary experiments, mean GI-SCV-2 recovery was 86.1% for the low spike

463

concentration, whereas at the high spike concentration, mean recovery dropped to 4.6%. A

464

potential cause for the decrease in GI-SCV-2 recovery at the high spike concentration may be

465

PCR inhibition. Although the use of magnetic beads has been expected to counter inhibitory

466

effects better than other column-based extraction methods (Hata et al., 2011), they are still

467

affected by inhibitory compounds. A common approach to reducing inhibitor interference is

468

through RNA sample dilutions. However, this results in direct dilution of both the inhibitory

469

substances present in the sample (Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020) and target RNA. Moreover,

470

dilution of samples containing low levels of RNA may cause target RNA concentrations to fall

471

below the LOD. Although dilution reduces the overall RNA concentration in the sample, the

472

simultaneous dilution of inhibitors may increase the efficacy of the PCR reaction (Wang et al.,

473

2017), thus resulting in a higher concentration of RNA detected.

474

To investigate inhibition as a potential cause of the GI-SCV-2 recovery loss, RNA extracts

475

from the wastewater samples spiked with 1.8x104 and 1.8x106 GU L-1 were diluted 10- and 50-

476

fold, respectively (n=3). For the low spike concentration, the RNA was diluted beyond the

477

detection limit and could not be enumerated. However, recoveries for the diluted RNA extracts

478

from the high spike concentration samples increased from 4.6 to approximately 100.1%. This

479

observation supports the hypothesis that the wastewater samples contained PCR inhibitors that

480

were co-extracted with surrogate RNA. During qPCR analysis, these inhibitors likely interfered

481

with the accurate amplification of RNA samples and substantially reduced the recovery of GI-

482

SCV-2. When the extracted RNA was diluted (along with the co-extracted inhibitors) and

483

reanalyzed, the diminished interference in the qPCR reaction allowed for more accurate RNA

484

quantitation.

485

For the recovery of HCV 229E, Ct values from the qPCR were used to provide an

486

indication of the copy number of target RNA. Logarithmically, Ct values are inversely

487

proportional to viral load. Consequently, as cycle numbers increase so do undesirable PCR

488

products. Thus, Ct values are bounded by a range of positive and negative cut-off values (Public

489

Health Ontario and The Ontario COVID-19 Testing Technical Working Group, 2020). The

490

positive cut-off, determined by manufacturers or laboratories during method validation, is

491

designated as the Ct value that represents the lowest copies of target RNA that can be reliably

492

detected (e.g., Ct ≤ 38). A negative cut-off represents a Ct value at which the target RNA can no

493

longer be detected. Ct values for HCV 229E ranged from 32.90 to 35.21 for the wastewater

494

spiked with 1.0x106 infectious units L-1 and from 37.42 to 38.22 for samples seeded with 1.0x104

495

infectious units L-1.

Method limit of detection (MLOD)
The MLOD was evaluated by spiking ASCV-2 in filtered wastewater over a concentration

499

range of 1x103 to 1x106 GU L-1 and calculated using a best fit Gompertz model (R2 = 0.980)

500

(Figure 3). The method was able to detect 100% of the replicates when the virus was present at

501

high concentrations (4.0x104 to 1.0x106 GU L-1). However, the percentage of positive replicates

502

decreased as the ASCV-2 concentration decreased. As shown in Figure 3, the experimentally

503

determined MLOD for the detection of ASCV-2 in wastewater with 95% confidence was

504

approximately 4.6x104 GU L-1. This value is within the range of theoretical limits of detection

505

(103 to 106 GU L-1) reported for 36 different methods used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 in raw

506

wastewater (Pecson et al., 2020).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater
The results of wastewater analysis for Communities A, B, and C are shown in Figure 4. A

513

total of eight samples from the WWTFs (influent) in Community A were tested, none of which

514

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments. However, of the five samples analyzed from

515

the sewershed in Community A, one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of

516

3.25x102 GU mL-1. Although this value is below the MLOD, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in

517

this sample may attributed to a difference in the degree of water matrix interferences. All 22

518

samples tested from the Community B WWTFs (influent/effluent) and pump station tested

519

negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was verified in

520

samples collected from the Community C sewershed on Day 1 (6.6x104 GU L-1) and Day 3

521

(1.4x104 GU L-1) (Table 5).

These results demonstrate that the magnetic bead-based extraction protocol allows

536

detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments when the virus is present in the wastewater sample

537

above the MLOD. However, the virus may remain undetected in samples processed using this

538

method if the viral RNA is present in concentrations below the MLOD. As observed in Table 5,

539

the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 remained below the MLOD during the third and fourth

540

sampling events for the sewershed and for all sampling events for the WWTF Influent. Viral load

541

from faeces varies largely within wastewater depending on the time of infection onset. Peak viral

542

shedding for SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur within two to three weeks of the onset of initial

543

symptoms (Zheng et al., 2020). The results presented in this section demonstrate the potential of

544

the rapid method proposed in this work for the detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in

545

wastewater using optimal method parameters: 1 mL sample volume, 100 µL of magnetic beads

546

per mL of sample, and RNA elution temperature of 60 °C.

4. CONCLUSIONS
This work outlines the development and optimization of a rapid and effective magnetic

550

bead-based extraction protocol in the detection of SARS-COV-2 in complex wastewater

551

samples. Through the optimization of the developed method, we found that the water matrix

552

impacted the recovery of ASCV-2 with values ranging from 1.3 to 11.8% for wastewater and 6.3

553

to 26.0% for DI water. Moreover, extracting RNA from wastewater (rather than DI water)

554

decreased RNA recovery by 7.8x104 GU L-1. Additional experiments testing the effects of

555

filtration and the addition of DTT on RNA recovery showed that there was no significant

556

difference in the recovery efficiency of ASCV-2 from filtered and non-filtered wastewater nor

557

with the addition of DTT (20 mM) to the lysis buffer, and thus, further work may be necessary to

558

address water matrix effects.

559

Independent of the water matrix, a higher elution temperature resulted in higher RNA

560

recoveries in both DI water and wastewater, and recovery increased by 5.7x104 GU L-1 as elution

561

temperature increased from 30 to 60 °C. Moreover, a smaller sample volume of 1 mL resulted in

562

higher mean RNA recoveries than did a sample volume of 2.5 mL when assessed at the same

563

conditions for all other variables. In general, increasing the sample volume from 1 to 2.5 mL

564

decreased recovery by 3.3x104 GU L-1. The concentration of magnetic beads in the sample also

565

greatly impacted results, as RNA recovery increased by 5.7x104 GU L-1 as the concentration of

566

magnetic beads increased from 15 to 100 µL mL-1 sample.

567

Using optimal method conditions, recoveries of GI-SCV-2 spiked in wastewater samples

568

at 1.8x104 and 1.8x106 GU L-1 were 86.1 and 4.6%, respectively. The method limit of detection

569

(MLOD) for this optimized method in pre-filtered wastewater was determined to be 4.6x104 GU

570

L-1 with a 95% degree of confidence. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples

571

collected from the sewersheds of Communities A and C demonstrated that with viral RNA

572

concentrations above the MLOD, the magnetic bead-based extraction protocol allowed rapid

573

identification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater without the need for sample pre-concentration or

574

centrifugation.

575

The optimized method described in this work may be used as an essential tool for the

576

wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. The method protocol is simple and transferable, thus

577

offering advantageous application for laboratories or circumstances that may have limited

578

resources.
