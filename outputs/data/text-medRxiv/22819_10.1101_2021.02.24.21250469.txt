Abstract
Objective To determine and compare the effects of drug prophylaxis on severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).
Design Living systematic review and network meta-analysis.
Data sources WHO covid-19 database, a comprehensive multilingual source of global covid-19
literature to 19 January 2021, and six additional Chinese databases to 20 January 2021.
Study selection Randomized trials in which people at risk of covid-19 were randomized to drug
prophylaxis or no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo). Pairs of reviewers independently
screened potentially eligible articles.
Methods After duplicate data abstraction, we conducted random-effects bayesian network metaanalysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using a modification of the Cochrane
risk of bias 2.0 tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the grading of
recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Results The first iteration of this living network meta-analysis includes nine randomized trials –
six addressing hydroxychloroquine (6,059 participants), one addressing ivermectin combined
with iota-carrageenan (234 participants) and two addressing ivermectin alone (540 participants),
all compared to standard care or placebo. Hydroxychloroquine has no important effect on
admission to hospital (risk difference (RD) 1 fewer per 1,000, 95% credible interval (CrI) 3
fewer to 4 more, high certainty) or mortality (RD 1 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 2 fewer to 3 more,
high certainty). Hydroxychloroquine probably has no important effect on laboratory-confirmed
infection (RD 2 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 18 fewer to 28 more, moderate certainty), probably
increases adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (RD 19 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 1
fewer to 70 more, moderate certainty) and may have no important effect on suspected, probable
or laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 15 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 64 fewer to 41 more, low
certainty). Due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision – and thus very low certainty
evidence, the effects of ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan on laboratory-confirmed
infection (RD 52 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 58 fewer to 37 fewer), and ivermectin alone on
laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 50 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 59 fewer to 16 fewer) and
suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection (RD 159 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 165
fewer to 144 fewer) remain uncertain.
Conclusion Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis does not have an important effect on hospital
admission and mortality, probably increases adverse effects, and probably does not have an
important effect on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of serious risk of bias
and very serious imprecision, we are highly uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iotacarrageenan and ivermectin alone reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Systematic review registration This review was not registered. The protocol established a
priori is included as a supplement.
Funding This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant CIHRIRSC:0579001321).
Readers’ note This article is a living systematic review that will be updated to reflect emerging
evidence. Updates may occur for up to two years from the date of original publication.

Introduction
As of 18 February 2021, more than 110 million people have been infected with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus
disease 2019 (covid-19); of these, more than 2.4 million have died.1 Cases and deaths continue to
rise, with resurgence of the virus occurring in many countries that previously gained control.
Drugs that are effective as prophylaxis, used either shortly after exposure (post-exposure
prophylaxis, PEP) or prior to exposure in a high-risk population (pre-exposure prophylaxis,
PrEP), to prevent or attenuate infection could have a monumental impact worldwide. Therefore,
researchers around the world are enrolling participants in randomized trials of drugs for
prophylaxis against covid-19.
A common understanding of the evidence from these randomized trials may be challenging
for healthcare workers and people interested in using a drug for prophylaxis. Timely evidence
summaries and associated guidelines could ameliorate the problem.2 Clinicians, patients,

guideline bodies, and government agencies also face challenges of interpreting the results from
trials that contribute to a rapidly evolving evidence-base. This environment necessitates well
developed summaries that distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy evidence.
Living systematic reviews and network meta-analyses resolve an important limitation of
traditional systematic reviews—that of providing an overview of the relevant evidence only at a
specific point in time.3 The ability of a living network meta-analysis to present a complete,
broad, and up-to-date view of the evidence makes it ideal to inform the development of practice
recommendations, ideally in the form of living clinical practice guidelines.3-5 Network metaanalysis, rather than pairwise meta-analysis, provides useful information about the comparative
effectiveness of treatments that have not been tested head-to-head. The lack of such direct
comparisons is certain to limit inferences in the covid-19 setting; therefore, network metaanalysis is critical to inform the selection of the best drug among all alternative options.
Moreover, the incorporation of indirect evidence can strengthen evidence in comparisons that
were tested head to head.6
In this living systematic review and network meta-analysis, we compare the effects of drug
prophylaxis for covid-19. This living network meta-analysis will – similarly to our established
living network meta-analysis on covid-19 treatment7 – directly inform living WHO guidelines on
drugs for covid-194,5, a collaborative effort between WHO and the MAGIC Evidence Ecosystem
Foundation (www.magicproject.org), inspired by the BMJ Rapid Recommendations.8,9 This
review will inform trustworthy, actionable, and living guidance to clinicians caring for and
patients with covid-19.

Methods
The protocol provides detailed methods of this systematic review (see supplementary file).
We report this living systematic review following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items
for systematic reviews and network meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist.10 A living systematic
review is a cumulative synthesis updated regularly as new evidence becomes available.11 The
linked BMJ Rapid Recommendations methods team approved all decisions relevant to data
synthesis.
Eligibility criteria
We included randomized trials of people at risk of covid-19 that compared drugs for
prophylaxis against one another or against no intervention, placebo, or standard care, with no
restriction on language. We included studies addressing patients with pre- or post-exposure
status and risk groups (i.e. unexposed community member, member of the same household with
one or more positive cases, contact of index case, healthcare worker or long-term care resident).
We also included trials of traditional Chinese medicines if the drug comprised one or more
specific molecules with a defined molecular weight dosing.
We excluded randomized trials published only as press releases and that evaluated
vaccination, drug treatments, antibody and cellular therapies, nutrition, and non-drug supportive
care interventions. We identified and separately categorized trials that evaluated these
interventions. We synthesize randomized trials that evaluate drug treatments, and antibody and
cellular therapies for covid-19 in separate living network meta-analyses.7

Information sources
We performed daily searches from Monday to Friday in the World Health Organization
(WHO) covid-19 database for eligible studies – a comprehensive multilingual source of global
literature on covid-19.12 Prior to its merge with the WHO covid-19 database on 9 October 2020,
we performed daily searches from Monday to Friday in the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) covid-19 Research Articles Downloadable Database for eligible studies.13 The
database includes, but is not limited to the following 25 bibliographic and grey literature sources:
Medline (Ovid and PubMed), PubMed Central, Embase, CAB Abstracts, Global Health,
PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Academic Search Complete, Africa Wide Information,
CINAHL, ProQuest Central, SciFinder, the Virtual Health Library, LitCovid, WHO covid-19
website, CDC covid-19 website, Eurosurveillance, China CDC Weekly, Homeland Security
Digital Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, bioRxiv (preprints), medRxiv (preprints), chemRxiv
(preprints), and SSRN (preprints). The supplementary file includes the CDC literature search
strategy.
We designed the daily searches to match the update schedule of the database and capture
eligible studies the day of or the day after publication. To identify randomized trials, we filtered
the results through a validated and highly sensitive machine learning model.14 We tracked
preprints of randomized trials until publication and, when discrepant, updated data to match that
in the peer-reviewed publication. When needed, we reconciled multiple versions of preprints,
post-hoc analyses, corrections and retractions.
In addition, monthly searches, utilizing adapted search terms for covid-19 developed by the
CDC for the Chinese language, included six Chinese databases: Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical
Literature, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, Chinese Medical Journal Net
(preprints), and ChinaXiv (preprints). The Chinese literature search also included search terms
for randomized trials (available upon request to corresponding author).
The search included monitoring, on an ongoing basis, living evidence retrieval services
including the Living Overview of the Evidence (L-OVE) covid-19 Repository by the
Epistemonikos Foundation and in collaboration with the Cochrane Canada Centre at McMaster
University, the Systematic and Living Map on covid-19 Evidence by the Norwegian Institute of
Public Health,.15,16
The search included all English information sources from 1 December 2019 to 19 January
2021, and the Chinese literature from conception of the databases to 20 January 2021.
Study selection
Using a systematic review software, Covidence,17 following training and calibration
exercises, pairs of reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, followed by full texts
of trials that were identified as potentially eligible. A third reviewer adjudicated conflicts.
Data collection
For each eligible trial, following training and calibration exercises, pairs of reviewers
extracted data independently using a standardised, pilot tested data extraction form. Reviewers
collected information on trial characteristics (trial registration, publication status, study status,
design), participant characteristics (country, age, sex, comorbidities), exposure characteristics

(exposure status, exposure duration, high risk group) and outcomes of interest (means or medians
and measures of variability for continuous outcomes and the number of participants analysed and
the number of participants who experienced an event for dichotomous outcomes). Reviewers
resolved discrepancies by discussion and, when necessary, with adjudication by a third party.
The review team selected outcomes of interest based on importance to patients and these
were informed by clinical expertise in the systematic review team and the linked guideline panel
responsible for the WHO living guidelines for covid-19.4,5 The panel includes unconflicted
clinical experts and patient partners, and was recruited to ensure global representation. We rated
outcomes from 1 to 9 based on importance to individual patients (9 being most important), and
we included any outcome rated 7 or higher by any panel member. This process resulted in choice
of the following outcomes: laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; a composite of
suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; admission to hospital
(within 28 days); mortality (closest to 90 days); adverse effects leading to discontinuation
(within 28 days); and time to symptom resolution or clinical improvement in the subset of
participants that became infected with SARS-CoV-2. In anticipation for inclusion in the linked
WHO recommendation for prophylactic drugs, data for drug-specific adverse effects included
trials reporting on hydroxychloroquine versus standard care or placebo. For only the first
iteration of this living systematic review, the supplementary file includes the results of pairwise
meta-analyses and related subgroup analyses for cardiac toxicity and non-serious gastrointestinal
adverse effects.
Because of inconsistent reporting across trials, when possible we preferentially extracted
participant characteristics and outcome data for participants PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2
infection at baseline. If authors did not report data separately for those who were PCR-negative
for SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline, we extracted data from all participants, regardless of their
PCR status at baseline.
Risk of bias within individual studies
For each eligible trial, following training and calibration exercises, reviewers used a revision
of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB 2.0)18 to rate trials at the
outcome level as either at i) low risk of bias, ii) some concerns—probably low risk of bias, iii)
some concerns—probably high risk of bias, or iv) high risk of bias, across the following
domains: bias arising from the randomization process; bias due to departures from the intended
intervention; bias due to missing outcome data; bias in measurement of the outcome; bias in
selection of the reported results, including deviations from the registered protocol; bias arising
from early termination for benefit; and bias arising from competing risks. We rated trials at high
risk of bias overall if one or more domains were rated as some concerns—probably high risk of
bias or as high risk of bias and as low risk of bias overall if all domains were rated as some
concerns—probably low risk of bias or low risk of bias. Reviewers resolved discrepancies by
discussion and, when not possible, with adjudication by a third party.

We summarised the effect of interventions on dichotomous outcomes using odds ratios (ORs)
and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs). To mitigate results with highly implausible and
extremely imprecise effect estimates, the analyses included only prophylactic drugs with at least
100 participants or 20 events, regardless of the number of studies in which the drug was assessed
or the number of participants who received the drug in each study.7 The analysis plan included,
data permitting, adjustment for cluster randomization.
Treatment nodes
We created nodes for each prophylactic drug (or combination of drugs), independent of dose
or duration. Standard care and placebo arms across included trials were combined into a single
node for analyses. The networkplot command of Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX) provided software for network plots in which the inverse variance of the direct comparison
determined the thickness of lines between nodes and the size of nodes.19
Statistical analysis
For outcomes with sufficient data (i.e. laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection), we performed random
effects network-meta analysis using the R package gemtc20 and used three Markov chains with
100 000 iterations after an initial burn-in of 10 000 and a thinning of 10. Node splitting models
provided methods to obtain indirect estimates and to assess local heterogeneity.21 For all other
outcomes, we performed random-effects bayesian meta-analysis using bayesmeta package in
RStudio version 3.5.3 (R Studio, Boston, MA, USA).22 An empirical study provided the basis for
choosing a plausible prior for the variance parameter and a uniform prior for the effect
parameter.23
Certainty of the evidence
The grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE)
approach for network meta-analysis provided the framework for assessing the certainty of
evidence.6,24 Two methodologists with experience in using GRADE rated each domain for each
comparison separately and resolved discrepancies by discussion. Criteria for rating the certainty
for each comparison and outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low, included considerations
of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias, intransitivity, incoherence
(difference between direct and indirect effects) and imprecision.24 Judgments of imprecision for
this systematic review were made using a minimally contextualised approach.25 The minimally
contextualised approach considers whether credible intervals include the null effect or when the
point estimate is close to the null effect, whether the credible interval lies within the boundaries
of small but important benefit and harm.
We rated the certainty of no important effect for the outcomes laboratory-confirmed
infection; suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection; admission to hospital; and
mortality. Pending data from quantitative studies of patient values, we chose thresholds of small,
but important effects of 0.5% for mortality, 3% for infection (whether laboratory-confirmed or
not), and 1% for admission to hospital.25 We rated the certainty that there is an increase or
decrease in adverse effects leading to discontinuation using the null effect as a threshold.

Publication Platform (www.magicapp.org) provided user friendly formats for clinicians and
patients, and allowed re-use in the context of clinical practice guidelines for covid-19, such as
the WHO living guidelines.4,5 Interim updates and additional study data will appear on our
website (www.covid19lnma.com).
Interpretation of results
To facilitate interpretation of the results, we calculated absolute effects for outcomes in which
the summary measure was an OR. For mortality, we used the event rate among all participants
randomized to standard care or placebo to calculate the baseline risk. For all other outcomes, we
use the median event rate in the standard care or placebo arms to calculate the baseline risk.
Subgroup and sensitivity analysis
The analysis plan includes performing subgroup analyses of pre-exposure versus postexposure studies, preprints versus peer-reviewed studies and high versus low risk of bias studies
when there are at least two studies in each subgroup. We plan to perform network metaregression to explore if duration of prophylactic drug use may modify the relative effect of the
drug on adverse effects leading to discontinuation hypothesizing that, if the drug is active at the
time of exposure, it will have a greater relative effect. The linked independent WHO guideline
panels may direct, in the future, additional subgroup analyses; in this first report, the panel
provided direction to perform subgroup analyses by drug prophylaxis duration and dose. The
Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses
(ICEMAN) tool provides the methodology for, whenever statistical evidence of a subgroup
effect exists, assessing subgroup hypothesis credibility.26
Patient and public involvement
As part of the WHO living guidelines and BMJ Rapid Recommendations initiative, patients
participated in defining clinical questions and rating the importance of outcomes for this
systematic review and are also involved in the interpretation of results and the generation of
parallel recommendations.

Results
As of 19 January 2021, after screening 25,763 titles and abstracts and 479 full texts, ten
unique randomized trials that evaluated prophylactic drugs proved eligible (fig 1) – six
addressing hydroxychloroquine; one ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan; two ivermectin
alone; and one ramipril.27-36 Searches of living evidence retrieval services identified two of these
eligible randomized trials.31,33 The supplementary files includes a table of excluded full texts.
Of the ten eligible randomized trials, six were published in peer-reviewed journals27-30,32,34,
two only as preprint31,33, and two were from clinical trial registries that reported results.35,36 All
trials were registered, published in English and evaluated prophylactic drugs against standard
care or placebo.27-36 Five evaluated prophylactic drugs in participants without documented
exposure to covid-1927,30-32,36 and four evaluated prophylactic drugs in participants with
documented exposure to covid-19.28,29,34,35 One randomized trial evaluated prophylactic
ivermectin in both participants pre-exposure and post-exposure to covid-19.33 Table 1 presents

the characteristics of the ten included studies, including prophylactic drug dose and duration, and
extent and setting of participant exposure to covid-19.
Six trials – one addressing ramipril, three hydroxychloroquine, and two ivermectin – reported
results for one or more outcomes of interest that were not prespecified in protocols or
registrations.27,30,31,33-35 The protocols and trial reports included no other discrepancies in
reporting of our outcomes of interest. Two trials were initially posted as preprints and
subsequently published in full after peer review.29,32 One trial published multiple iterations of
their preprint.33 The supplementary file presents additional study characteristics, outcome data,
and reporting differences between versions of study preprints and/or peer-reviewed publications.
Fig 1 Study selection

We performed the analyses on 18 January 2021 and included nine randomized trials that
evaluated hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (with and without iota-carrageenan) prophylaxis
against no prophylaxis (standard care or placebo).28-36 One randomized trial that evaluated
ramipril against standard care, not included in the network meta-analysis because it enrolled less
than 100 patients and observed less than 20 events in the ramipril arm, reported that ramipril had
no effect on the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of covid-19.27 Since molecule,
not dose or duration, dictates choice of nodes, we combined the two active arms in one included
three-arm trial – hydroxychloroquine once weekly and hydroxychloroquine twice weekly.32 In
this report, because the authors did not report the intracluster correlation coefficient, we could
not adjust for cluster randomization in one analysed trial addressing hydroxychloroquine.29 A
published post-hoc analysis with one of the analysed trials addressing hydroxychloroquine did
not include information beyond what was already reported in the original peer-reviewed
publication of the trial.28,37
Risk of bias in included studies
The supplementary material presents the assessment of risk of bias of the ten included studies
for each outcome. Five studies addressing hydroxychloroquine proved at low risk of bias across
all outcomes.28,30-32,34 Five studies proved at high risk of bias overall.27,29,33,35,36
Effects of the interventions
The supplementary material presents the network and forest plots depicting the interventions
included in the network meta-analysis of each outcome. The supplementary file also presents
detailed relative and absolute effect estimates and certainty of the evidence for all comparisons
and outcomes. We did not detect statistical incoherence in any of the comparisons or outcomes.
Five trials evaluated hydroxychloroquine against placebo28,30-32,34 and four trials – one addressing
hydroxychloroquine,29 one ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan36 and two ivermectin
alone33,35 – were evaluated against standard care, defined as no specific therapy29,35, standard
biosecurity care36 and personal protective measures.33 Figure 2 presents a summary of the effects
of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin alone on the
outcomes, and we describe these results herein.
Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
Eight trials reported on laboratory-confirmed infection in 5,728 participants who were PCRnegative at baseline and were included in random-effects bayesian network meta-analysis.28-34,36

The network nodes included were hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin combined with iotacarrageenan, ivermectin alone and standard care or placebo. Hydroxychloroquine, compared to
standard care or placebo, probably has no effect on laboratory-confirmed infection (OR 1.03,
95% CrI 0.71 to 1.47, RD 2 more per 1,000, 95% CrI 18 fewer to 28 more, moderate certainty).
We are uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan, when compared to
standard care, reduces the risk of laboratory-confirmed infection (OR 0.12, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.38,
RD 52 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 58 fewer to 37 fewer, very low certainty) (Fig 2). We are also
uncertain whether ivermectin alone, when compared to standard care, reduces risk of laboratoryconfirmed infection (OR 0.16, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.73, RD 50 fewer per 1,000, 95% CrI 59 fewer
to 16 fewer, very low certainty).
Suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
Four trials reported on the composite of suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed
infection in 4,531 participants and were included in random-effects bayesian network metaanalysis consisting of hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and standard care or placebo
nodes.28,29,32,35 For the outcome suspected, probable and laboratory-confirmed infection, low
certainty evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine, compared to standard care or placebo, may
have no effect (OR 0.90, 95% CrI 0.58 to 1.31; RD 15 fewer per 1,000 participants, 95% CrI 64
fewer to 41 more). Due to very low certainty evidence, the effect of ivermectin, compared to
standard care, in reducing the risk of suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed infection
remains uncertain (OR 0.06, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.13; RD 159 fewer per 1,000 participants, 95%
CrI 165 fewer to 144 fewer).
Hospital admission
Five trials reported hospital admission in 5,659 participants randomized to
hydroxychloroquine, standard care or placebo.28-30,32,34 Trials on other prophylactic drugs eligible
for analysis did not report on the outcome hospital admission, precluding network meta-analysis.
Hydroxychloroquine has no important effect on hospital admission when compared to standard
care or placebo (OR 0.87, 95% CrI 0.42 to 1.77, RD 1 fewer per 1,000 participants, 95% CrI 3
fewer to 4 more, high certainty) (Fig 2).
Mortality
Five trials reported mortality in 5,153 participants randomized to hydroxychloroquine,
ivermectin, standard care, or placebo.28-30,32,35 Although we had sufficient data to perform
network meta-analysis, the network did not converge; therefore, we present results from pairwise
meta-analyses. Hydroxychloroquine has no important effect on mortality when compared to
standard care or placebo (OR 0.70, 95% CrI 0.24 to 1.99; RD 1 fewer per 1,000 participants,
95% CrI 2 fewer to 3 more, high certainty) (Fig 2). Because there were no deaths in the one
ivermectin trial reporting mortality, we are very uncertain about its effect on this patientimportant outcome.
Adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation
Four trials reported adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation in 3,616 participants
randomized to hydroxychloroquine, standard care, or placebo.28-31 Trials on other prophylactic
drugs eligible for analysis did not report any adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation,

precluding network meta-analysis. Hydroxychloroquine probably increases adverse effects when
compared to standard care or placebo (OR 2.34, 95% CrI 0.93 to 6.08, RD 19 more per 1,000
participants, 95% CrI 1 fewer to 70 more, moderate certainty) (Fig 2).
Time to symptom resolution or clinical improvement
No randomized trials reported on time to symptom resolution or clinical improvement in the
subset of participants that developed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Subgroup analysis
Insufficient data precluded subgroup analysis for trials randomizing patients to ivermectin
alone or ivermectin with iota-carrageenan versus standard care. Thus, we limited subgroup
analysis to hydroxychloroquine trials only. We did not find any statistical evidence of differences
in laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, suspected, probable or laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission, or adverse effects leading to discontinuation
between pre-exposure30-32 and post-exposure28,29,34 studies or based on hydroxychloroquine
dosing regimens (see supplementary file). Extremely low event rates precluded investigation of
subgroup effects for mortality.

Discussion
This living systematic review and network meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview
of the evidence for prophylaxis against covid-19 up to 19 January 2021 and directly informs
WHO living guidelines on prophylaxis.5 Hydroxychloroquine versus no prophylaxis, ivermectin
with iota-carrageenan versus no prophylaxis and ivermectin versus no prophylaxis were the
comparisons for which there was informative evidence. Hydroxychloroquine probably increases
adverse effects leading to drug discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). For other
outcomes (laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospital admission and mortality),
study results provide moderate and high certainty evidence – none of which support any benefit
to hydroxychloroquine. Due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision, we are highly
uncertain whether ivermectin combined with iota-carrageenan and ivermectin alone reduce the
risk of patient-important outcomes.
These findings are consistent with those reported in a meta-analysis of hydroxychloroquine
prophylaxis against no prophylaxis, which did not find any statistical evidence of a benefit with
hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for the patient-important outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
hospital admission and death.38 The study also concluded that hydroxychloroquine is likely to
increase the risk of adverse effects.38 The risk of death is much lower in people at risk of covid19 compared to those diagnosed with covid-19.7 Similarly, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection
varies depending on pre- or post-exposure status and setting. Therefore, prophylactic research
necessitates very large trials and/or a focus on the highest risk populations to detect a possible
benefit on outcomes of most importance to patients. Further, rare but important harms may not
be detected with randomized trials unless they enrol an extremely large sample size, diligently
follow-up to ascertain these outcomes, or include patients at greater risk. Guideline panels, which
independently rate the certainty of the evidence, therefore have to consider the trade-offs
between concluding probably no benefit and meaningful adverse effects, and waiting for more

precise data. For example, the WHO living guidelines issued a strong recommendation against
hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis in covid-19.5
Strengths and limitations of this review
This, the first network meta-analysis published on prophylactic drugs for covid-19,
incorporates the most up-to-date evidence on hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin with iotacarrageenan and ivermectin alone. It adds to our living systematic review on drugs for covid-19
and directly informs the WHO living guidelines, together constituting major innovations in the
evidence ecosystem.5
The search strategy was comprehensive with explicit eligibility criteria, and no restrictions
on the language of publication. To ensure expertise in all areas, our team includes clinical and
methods experts who have undergone training and calibration exercises for all stages of the
review process. In order to avoid spurious findings, we prespecified that we would only analyse
drugs to which at least 100 people had been randomized or 20 events have been observed. The
single trial that evaluated ramipril against standard care was therefore omitted from the network
meta-analysis, necessitated by the priority to avoid issues that arise from network meta-analysis
of sparse data (uninformative and implausible results).7
The GRADE approach provided the structure for rating certainty of evidence and interpreting
the results considering absolute effects. To rate the GRADE domain of imprecision, we
prespecified thresholds of effect that most would consider small but important. In the absence of
empiric data, these thresholds represent our collective experience but are, to a large extent,
arbitrary. People placing a larger or smaller value on certain outcomes may reasonably make
different inferences about the certainty of evidence for no important effect. For example, people
who consider that the smallest important effect in mortality is increasing or reducing 2 per 1000
or more deaths, would rate down the certainty of the evidence due to imprecision and conclude
that hydroxychloroquine probably does not have an effect on this outcome (i.e. moderate
certainty).
With regard to limitations of the review, some conclusions are based on very low certainty
evidence and we therefore anticipate future studies evaluating ivermectin for prophylaxis may
substantially change the results, particularly for outcomes of infection and mortality.39 One
cluster randomized trial did not report the design effect or the intracluster correlation coefficient
itself necessary to calculate the design effect, precluding adjustment in analyses – potentially
leading to falsely narrow credible intervals.29 Cluster sizes were, however, small, making
substantial bias unlikely.
The living nature of our systematic review and network meta-analysis could amplify
publication bias, because studies with promising results are more likely to be published sooner
than studies with negative results. Given the failure of hydroxychloroquine trials to show benefit,
this is not a concern for hydroxychloroquine. This is, however, a concern for the evidence to date
on ivermectin, for which none of the data has been peer-reviewed. With the inclusion of this data
in network meta-analysis from one preprint33 and two clinical trial registries reporting results,35,36
we found evidence of large positive effects; however, bias from simple errors and reporting
limitations might have been introduced. We include these data, regardless of publication status

and risk of bias, because of the urgent need for information and because so many of the studies
on covid-19 are published first as preprints.
Another limitation of the evidence to date is lack of blinding, which might introduce bias
through differences in co-interventions between randomization groups, especially when
measuring the outcomes clinically suspected and probable infection, and adverse effects leading
to discontinuation of the drug. We chose to consider the treatment arms that did not receive an
active experimental drug (i.e., placebo or standard care) within the same node: it is possible that
unblinded standard care groups29,33,35,36 may have received systematically different cointerventions or changed their personal protective behaviours when compared to groups
randomized to receive a placebo.28,30-32,34 Laboratory confirmation mitigates risk of bias from
lack of blinding in outcome measurement; however, the availability of diagnostic testing differs
across health systems, warranting the additional use of a symptomatic case definition for
infection. This was the case for the majority of participants, including healthcare workers,
enrolled in one study in the United States, which risked overestimating incidence of infection by
using a symptomatic definition for infection.28,40

Conclusions
This living systematic review and network meta-analysis on prophylactic drugs for covid-19
provides evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not have an important effect on mortality and
hospital admission, probably increases adverse effects, and probably does not have an important
effect on laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We are very uncertain if ivermectin with
or without iota-carrageenan reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality because of
serious risk of bias, very serious imprecision and the effect estimates are likely to change
substantially with additional evidence from ongoing trials. No other drug has been studied in
large enough trials to make any inferences regarding effects of prophylaxis for covid-19.
