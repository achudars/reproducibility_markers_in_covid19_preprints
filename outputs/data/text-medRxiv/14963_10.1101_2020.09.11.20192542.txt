ABSTRACT

27

Background: Since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the 2019 novel

28

coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a worldwide pandemic, as the Iraqi authorities have started

29

responding and taking action to control the spread of the pandemic. The knowledge and practices

30

of the public play an important role in curbing the spreading of the virus by following the health

31

guidelines. This study aimed to assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and

32

practices of Iraqi living in Mosul-Iraq towards novel coronavirus during its rapid rise.

33

Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of 909 participants was conducted among Mosul-Iraq

34

between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The survey included three parts: 1) socio-demographic

35

characteristics, 2) participants' knowledge, 3) participants' practices. T-test, ANOVA, chi-square,

36

and binary logistic regression were used. A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered

37

statistically significant.

38

Results: The results showed knowledge and practice mean score of (12.91±1.67) and (21.56±

39

2.92) with cumulative knowledge and practice of 86% and 76% respectively towards 2019-

40

nCoV. Socio-demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, gender, level of education

41

and employment were statistically related with a higher mean score of knowledge and practice

42

towards the virus as P<0.05.

43

Conclusions: We concluded that the majority of the respondents demonstrate a high level of

44

knowledge and practices towards 2019-nCoV except respondents with socio-demographic

45

characteristics such as those who were younger, male respondents, those with lower education

46

and those unemployed as such campaigns that will increase the knowledge and encourage

47

adequate preventive practice towards 2019-nCoV should be targeted towards this group.

INTRODUCTION

51

On 31st December 2019, the novel coronavirus detected in Wuhan, China, on 11-March 2020,

52

has been considered as a global pandemic by the (WHO), at the end of April, the virus has spread

53

worldwide with fear-evoking death reports (1, 2).

54

The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is highly contagious; it causes a respiratory illness that

55

ranges from the common cold-like symptoms to more severe diseases (2). Most of the infected

56

patients complaining from fever, shortness in breath, cough, loss of smell, and/or taste sensation

57

and might be infected asymptomatically. In severe cases, patients might suffer from pneumonia,

58

multiple organ dysfunction, and death. (3, 4).

59

The 2019-nCoV is a novel strain that is not specified in humans earlier, and it is a zoonotic

60

illness that is transmitted between animals and people and may infect humans and animals. (5).

61

In Iraq, the first case of novel coronavirus was confirmed on 24th -February-2020 in Al-Najaf

62

city by people who have visited Iran. Therefore, at the end of March 13-2020, the Ministry of

63

Health and Environment of Iraq declared that the total of confirmed cases of coronavirus is

64

101(6). The ministry of health (MOH) in Iraq started to respond and take action to control the

65

infection, as well as the technical observation of (WHO), three governmental biological

66

laboratories in Baghdad, Basrah, and Erbil, were opened for COVID-19 outbreak testing. (7).

67

Initially, the measures that were taken by the Iraqi authorities nationwide have succeeded in

68

managing to slow the spread of the virus, but the cases have risen sharply in the past two months.

69

In the first week of August, Mosul city recorded thirty times increased in novel coronavirus cases

70

reported compared to the previous months, while the reported national cases rose from 10,000 to

71

120,000 across the country (8).

72

Due to the escalating number of cases in Mosul city, many challenges were observed while

73

trying to stop the virus from spreading, the limited number of tests that can be carried out per

74

day, lack of quarantine facilities, medical instrument, hygienic preparation insufficiency, low

75

hospital capacities, and no approved medicine or vaccine to prevent the 2019 n-CoV. Therefore,

76

the preventive measures taken by the people are important to protect themselves and others from

77

the virus infection and control the spread of the disease (9). Thus, managing this crisis hangs

78

primarily on people’s knowledge and practices toward this virus and following all the

79

precautions to prevent cross-infection and follow guidelines of the World Health Organization

80

(WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (10, 11 ).

81

World Health Organization (WHO) declared precautional strategies to curb the spreading of

82

infections. The none medical precautions are maintaining social distancing, avoid public

83

gathering, avoid direct contact with infected people and use of personal protective equipment

84

(PPE) like face masks. Also, personal hygiene recommendations such as hand-washing often

85

with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after touching surfaces, don’t touch the

86

nose, eyes, and mouth with unwashed hands, and self-isolate when 2019-nCoV symptoms started

87

(10).

88

The knowledge and practices of the public toward 2019 novel coronavirus play an important role

89

in determining the willingness of Iraqi citizens to change their behavior and identify the kind of

90

intervention that is needed to correct the misconceptions regarding the virus, highlight the poor

91

knowledge toward the virus and disease, development of new preventive measures, develop

92

COVID-19 awareness campaign, and take precautionary. Therefore, the current study aimed to

93

assess the socio-demographic correlate of knowledge and practices of Iraqi in Mosul towards

94

2019 novel coronavirus during its rapid rise.

95

The results of this study are expected to provide baseline information about the level of

96

knowledge and practices of Iraqi living in Mosul and highlight misperceptions related to

97

preventive measures. The outcomes of the study will further hence better planning for effective

98

awareness campaigns, required interventions and taking the appropriate action from local

99

authorities.

1. MATERIAL AND METHODS

101

Study design

102

A cross-sectional survey was adopted for the study using an online google form platform. The

103

invitation of the respondents (Mosul-Iraqi) to participate in the survey was made on social media

104

using the most popular media in Iraq, the social media messenger applications such as;

105

WhatsApp and Facebook messengers were used in distributing the online google based

106

questionnaire and participation was limited to Mosul-Iraqi 18 years and above.

107

Study Settings

108

Mosul is located in Nineveh Governorate - Iraq, has a population of 3.5 million. Residents of

109

Mosul city suffer from a fragile health system that barely meets their basic needs, as many health

110

facilities were destroyed in 2017 (8).

111

Survey and data collection

112

A total of 909 Mosul–Iraqi participated in our study between 20th June to 1st July 2020. The

113

specified Sample size was by determining the lowest acceptable size of a demographic subgroup

114

with a ±5% margin of error and a confidence level of 95% (12, 13). Giving to this, out of the

115

total respondents of 1121 who filled the online google based questionnaire, only 909 were

116

included. An incomplete survey of participants of 212 was excluded from the study, leaving us

117

with a completion rate of 81%.

118

The survey was an adapted version of questionnaires published previously (14, 15,16). The

119

survey was reviewed, and pilot tested by 21 Iraqi people and 3 faculty experts at the University

120

of Mosul using WhatsApp and telephone interviews to correct any question then sent it to the

121

target population. The survey consisted of an interface page and three main themes, with a total

122

of 37 questions. The interface page included the title, objective of the study, information on

123

participants’ privacy, and instructions to fill the survey. The three main themes included: 1)

124

demographic information of participants such as gender, age, education level, marital status,

125

employment status, coronavirus test, coronavirus result and Chronic diseases; 2) Knowledge

126

related the 2019 novel coronavirus consisted of 15 questions divided to clinical presentations of

127

virus (K1-K5), the spread of the virus (K6-K9) prevention (K10-K12) and the risk factors (K13-

128

K15); 3) practices of participants toward novel coronavirus outbreak, which included 13

129

questions. The google based questionnaire was designed in Arabic to encourage adequate

130

participation of the respondents since Arabic is the common language in Mosul city.

131

Ethical approval

132

The Research Ethics Committee (RIC) at the University of Sharjah, UAE approved this study by

133

the reference number is REC- 20-05-31-01, as of 14/06/2020.

134

Data and statistical analysis

135

Data analysis conducted using Statistical Package for Social Software (SPSS) version 22. Scale

136

reliability was performed to ensure data consistency (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient = 0.729),

137

indicating good consistency. The frequencies of demographic characteristics, knowledge, and

138

practice answers along with descriptive statistics, were presented in mean ± SD, while qualitative

139

data were presented in frequency (number\percent). Participants’ knowledge and practice scores

140

were compared with demographics factors using independent- samples t-test, one-way analysis

141

of variance (ANOVA).

142

To measure the knowledge, participants were given “yes,” “no,” and “not sure” answer options

143

to each survey question. A true answer to each question was marked with 1 score, while false

144

answers and not sure were marked with 0 scores. Scores of total knowledge ranged from 0-15; a

145

higher score signals a better level of knowledge. To practice measures, participants were given

146

"always", "sometimes", and " never” answer options to each item; the always option was marked

147

for 2 scores, while sometimes was for 1 score, and rarely was for 0 scores. The total practice

148

scores ranged from 0-26. The lowest and highest score of participants' knowledge was 7 and 15,

149

respectively, while the lowest and highest score of practice was 14 and 26, respectively.

150

Pearson’s chi-square was used to determine the association between the explanatory and

151

outcome variables. We examined the factors associated with good knowledge & practice and

152

poor knowledge & practices by using binary logistic regression analyses. A p-value of less than

153

0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant.

154

To identify the factors that were significantly associated with good or poor knowledge and

155

practices, a mean knowledge score of more than 12 indicated as good knowledge, while less than

156

12 assigned as poor. Similarly, a mean practice score above 21 indicated as good practice and a

157

mean practice score below 21 as poor practice. Factors were selected with a backward stepwise

158

method, and the reference category was selected based on the higher total mean. Unstandardized

159

regression coefficients (β) and odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were

160

used to quantify the associations between cofactors with knowledge and practice.

2. RESULTS

162

Socio-demographic characteristics

163

The results showed that the majority of 61.4% were females, and 38.6% were males. More

164

than half of the participants, 54.5%, aged 30-49 years. Around 60.5% of respondents were

165

married, while 31.7% and 7.9% were single, and others (divorced and widows), respectively.

166

About 62.4% were holding a bachelor’s degree, while 25.7, 11.9% were holding postgraduates

167

and diploma or below, respectively. Moreover, almost 64.5% were employed, while a smaller

168

number of participants, 21.8%, 13.9%, were unemployed and students, respectively. Some of the

169

participants, 7.9%, have been tested for COVID-19, while 92.1% didn’t do the COVID-19 est.

170

However, 1.5% of tested respondents were positive, and 98.5% of the participants have been

171

negative tests. Figure 1 summarized the frequency of respondents according to demographic

172

characteristics.

173
174

Prevalence of chronic diseases reported by Iraqi participants

175

176

In our study, 82.4% of the participants were healthy, while 17.6% had chronic diseases. The

177

most common chronic diseases were diabetes 6%, followed by asthma at 3.30%. Moreover,

178

2.75%, 2.40%, 1.54%, 1.54%, 1.20% had chronic kidney disease, severe obesity, heart

179

conditions, chronic liver disease, and chronic lung diseases, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.

180

Knowledge towards novel coronavirus

181

The mean knowledge score (±SD) of 15 questions was (12.91±1.67). The correct percentage rate

182

was 86.08%. Most of the participants, 92.1%, answered correctly that novel coronavirus caused

183

by a virus; the majority, 94.1%, knew that the incubation period range of this virus is between 2-

184

14 days. Almost all participants had a high knowledge of 96% about the symptoms of a

185

novel coronavirus; about 72.3% of respondents knew that no vaccine toward this virus.

186

Moreover, 63.4% knew that no treatment was approved toward novel coronavirus until now.

187

When we asked if this virus is spread via respiratory droplets of infected people, 93.1%

188

answered correctly.

189

Similarly, A high proportion of 93.1% of the participants agreed that the virus could be

190

transmitted via touching contaminated surfaces. Also, 82.2% indicated that this virus was

191

transmitted through the eyes, nose, and mouth. Just over half, 59.4%, reported that the infected

192

person having no fever could infect healthy people and the majority of participants, 94.1%

193

recorded that children and young adults have to take measures toward novel coronavirus.

194

About 76.2% of respondents reported the individuals should stay at home and go out only when

195

necessary, while all of the participants 100% agreed that they should avoid going to crowded

196

places, and the infected person with this virus should be immediately isolated in a proper place.

197

Most of the respondents, 96%, answered that the virus is more dangerous for those with chronic

198

disease patients and the elderly, while 79.2% believed that smokers are more vulnerable to this

199

virus. The knowledge of participants toward novel coronavirus is displayed in Table 1.

200

Practice towards novel coronavirus

201

The mean practice score (±SD) of 13 questions was (21.56± 2.92). The correct percentage rate

202

was 75.8%. We found that 92.1% of the participants started washing their hands frequently

203

during a novel coronavirus period. Similarly, 92.1% indicated they were used sanitizer if the

204

soap is not available, while usual handwashing with soap for 20 seconds was recorded by 77.2%

205

of respondents. Almost 83.2% of participants wearied a mask when they go outside the home.

206

Three-quarters, 72.3% of respondents maintain space between them and others when going

207

outside, and only 36.6% maintain the 2-meter distance between them and others to prevent

208

transmission of the virus.

209

About 88% of the Iraqi respondents stopped going to crowded places recently. However, two-

210

thirds of the respondents, 69.3% and 65.3%, reported that they stopped visiting and kissing their

211

relatives or friends when meeting them, while 77.2% stopped the handshake during the greeting

212

with others. Besides, 81.2% were aware of the essential of sanitizing their hands after using cash,

213

and 75.2% of participants were aware of the importance of avoiding sharing their food with

214

others. The participant’s practices toward novel coronavirus prevention presented in Table 2.

215

Sources of information on COVID-19

216

Participants indicated that the Ministry of Health and Environment in Iraq (MOH) and social

217

media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Snapchat were the main

218

sources of information about novel coronavirus pandemic with 60.3% and 57.5% respectively,

219

followed by World Health Organization (WHO) press release 41.6%, while 28.7%, 15.8%, and

220

1.4% reported that they received their information from the news outlet, family and friends, and

221

other sources, respectively as presented in Figure 3.

222

Level of knowledge (K) and practice (P) as per socio-demographic characteristics of

223

participants

224

The knowledge level score (out of 15) showed a significant association across socio-

225

demographic characteristics such as gender, age, education levels, marital status, and

226

employment status (p<0.005). The practice level score (out of 26) also showed a significant

227

association between gender and age-groups (p<0.005) while there was no significant

228

association between marital status ((p=0.061), educational (p=0. 385) and employment (p=0.084)

229

with the practice of the participants.

230

The results indicated that females had a higher mean score of knowledge (13.19±1.70) and

231

practice (21.85±2.61) than males, aged group of participants above 50-years-old having the

232

highest score of knowledge (14.11±0.87) and practice (22.50±2.32) compared with other age

233

groups. Moreover, widows and divorced women's knowledge (13.37±1.32) were higher than

234

singles and married participants; however, there were no significant differences in practice. The

235

mean score of knowledge (13.26±1.51) and practice (21.75 ±2.77) of participants with high

236

education degrees were better than participants with lower educational degrees. Employed

237

respondents showed a higher-level score of knowledge (13.12±1.61) than non-employed and

238

students’ participants. While there were no significant differences in employment status in

239

practice, neither education levels nor employment status had any significant differences in

240

practice, as depicted in table 3.

241

Binary logistic regression analysis

242

Table 4 shows the binary logistic regression analysis on variables significantly correlated with

243

knowledge and practice (good and poor) about 2019 novel coronavirus.

244

The Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a bid to quantify the

245

relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and the knowledge score (>12 and <12),

246

and between socio-demographic characteristics and the practices score (>21 and < 21). Overall,

247

the analysis presents a significant relationship between knowledge with age, marital status, and

248

employment status. The same table shows that the age of ≥50 vs other ages reported better

249

knowledge, divorced & widows vs. married and single participants were significantly related

250

with a higher mean score, employed people were significantly related with the better knowledge

251

vs unemployed and retired respondents (β:-1.790, OR: 0.167, CI: 0.103-.270). Moreover, gender,

252

age, education and employment status were significantly associated with good practices. Female

253

gender vs male (β: -0.458 OR: 0.633, CI 0.464-0.863), age group of ≥50 had higher practice

254

score than the youngest group of 18-29 and 30-49 (β: -0.790, OR: 0.454, CI: 0.261-0.788), (β: -

3. DISCUSSION

261

262

The knowledge and practices of the public play an important role in prevention by following the

263

health guidelines to control the spread of 2019-nCoV. The knowledge and practices of the

264

general population about novel coronavirus have changed during the pandemic as a defense line

265

against the disease.

266

The provided baseline data regarding the level of individuals' knowledge on clinical

267

presentations, transmission, prevention, and risk factors of novel coronavirus virus will help

268

highlight malpractices related to preventive measures hence making it critical for local

269

authorities to plan suitable strategies to prepare and manage the spread of the virus.

270

The current study resulted that the participants' knowledge was high (86%) and had good

271

measures of practice toward 2019 novel coronavirus (76%). Similar to our findings, several

272

studies done in many countries have reported high levels of knowledge about novel coronavirus,

273

among the general population in Malaysia 80.5%, Chinese residents 90%, Saudi Arabia

274

population 81.5%, and among healthcare workers in Pakistan 93.2%. (14, 4, 15, 16).

275

The high level of knowledge among the public may be due to most of the participants having a

276

college degree or higher, or due to the high level of media coverage, including all media outlets

277

and the impact of the pandemic on social life mandating that people follow.

278

The current results showed that most of the participants depend more on the ministry of health

279

and social media to get their information about the 2019 novel coronavirus, In contrast to other

280

studies among Jordanian, Egyptian and Pakistani populations that were using mostly social

281

media as the main source of information (17, 18, 19).

282

The study found that the majority of respondents had a good level in prevention and control

283

measures toward novel coronavirus, indicating that the practices of some respondents were very

284

good toward novel coronavirus. That the results reported on practice toward 2019-nCoV among

285

the respondents were similar to those reported in the Malaysian population (14) while being less

286

than the level of practices among Chinese residents (4).

287

This level of practice among the respondents attributed that the Iraqi government didn't take

288

drastic measures in reducing the spread of the disease, in addition to the low number of cases in

289

Mosul at the beginning of the pandemic (20).

290

Our results using t-tests, ANOVA and logistic regression analysis showed that there was better

291

knowledge and accurate practices associated significantly with female gender, respondents above

292

50 years old, employed respondents, higher education, and married respondents.

293

Females and mothers are expected to show better knowledge and practices towards the 2019

294

novel coronavirus precautions and preventions. Similar studies in Malaysian and Saudi Arabia

295

indicated that females had more knowledge regarding novel coronavirus than males (14, 15).

296

The high level of knowledge and practice among the participants that are above the age of 50 in

297

our study is possibly due to understanding the higher risk of contraction and complications of the

298

disease on the elderly and people with chronic diseases (21). In our study, the respondents that

299

hold a higher degree level had a greater level of knowledge than the others. Similar findings

300

were reported within Malaysian and Pakistani university populations (14,19). A great majority of

301

respondents confirmed that the novel coronavirus disease is more dangerous in patients with

302

chronic diseases and the elderly. This has been confirmed from many studies published regarding

303

the 2019 novel coronavirus disease in China (22, 23).

304

Our results reported that 17.5 % of the respondents had chronic diseases such as diabetes,

305

asthma, and severe obesity were the common diseases among our participants. A similar study

306

among Iraqi adults indicated that the common non-communicable diseases were hypertension

307

(13.3%) and overweight or obese (54.6%). Another study showed that diabetes and hypertension

308

were the most prevalent diseases among Iraqi people (24, 25).

309

Our results were compatible with many studies that showed similar significance in terms of

310

better knowledge and practice among the educated and employed people. (4, 14, 15,26, 27).

311

Finally, the results indicated that more informative novel coronavirus efforts and more intense

312

health education should be directed toward respondents with the following socio0demographic

313

characteristics; male respondents, respondents with lower educational levels, younger

314

respondents, and unmarried respondents.

315

Limitations

316

Since the study is a cross-sectional study, it was conducted within a short time during the

317

pandemic. Moreover, this study was an online survey that expected that the people with a higher

318

level of education would respond to the survey; as such, it doesn’t give privilege to the

319

uneducated population and those with limited access to the internet.

321

In general, the current study provided a comprehensive screening of the knowledge and

322

practices of the population in Mosul city toward the 2019 novel coronavirus. The participants

323

had a high level of knowledge about the virus, and good practice towards using protective

324

measures, which is significant towards controlling the spread of the virus. The study

325

recommends developing informative novel coronavirus related campaigns targeted specifically

326

towards younger males, lower educated, and unemployed people were living in Mosul city.

327

Furthermore, interventions that encourage the provision and use of free personal protective

328

equipment (PPE) such as face mask should be developed as this will help curb the spreading of

329

the virus. In the same vein, the Iraqi government should take more effort to control the spread of

330

the disease.
