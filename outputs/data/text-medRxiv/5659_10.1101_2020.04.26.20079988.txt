[ABSTRACT]
Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the systemic entity caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may cause death
through severe atypical pneumonia and acute lung injury. Valproic acid (VPA) has shown
anti-inflammatory activity and mild intrinsic antiviral effect. These properties warrant the
study of VPA as a possible active treatment in persons with severe COVID-19.
Methods: Consecutive adult patients needing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) will be
given intravenous (i.v.) VPA at a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day and up to 60/kg/day (in 60 min
i.v. infusions in 250 mL normal saline) as needed to reach plasma VPA concentrations of 50100 µg/mL (measured every 72 h). These patients will be followed-up for 10 days for the
primary outcome and for a further period of 30 days after treatment completion for the
secondary outcome of recurrence. The primary study outcome is the reduction in the case
fatality rate of at least 50% after 10 days of treatment (as compared with natural history).
Secondary outcomes are the reduction of length of stay (LOS) of at least 50%, as well as
COVID-19 recurrence at 30-day follow-up. The most important safety outcomes are acute
liver failure, acute pancreatitis, and thrombocytopenia.
Conclusion: Although long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences
have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, given the urgent need for a drug against
COVID-19 to shorten the high mortality and LOS, the study of VPA is justified from a
scientific standpoint.
Keywords: Atypical pneumonia, coronavirus, COVID-19, Mexico, pandemics, valproate,

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the systemic disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that may cause death through severe
atypical pneumonia and acute lung injury. There is a need for useful molecules that may cut
the rate of deaths and hospital length of stay (LOS) that produce such a high sanitary burden.
Given the urgent need for high-efficacy drugs, repurposed molecules may be the most
efficient approach given the scarce time to limit the sanitary and economic impact of the
present pandemics.
Valproic acid (VPA, the conjugate base is valproate) is available as sodium, semi
sodium, and magnesium. VPA is a drug primarily used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, as
well as migraine.1 Chemically VPA is a weak organic acid that was first synthesized in 1882 as
an analog of valeric acid, found naturally in the plant valeriana officinalis.1,2 VPA was tested
initially as a solvent of organic compounds, and latter found serendipitously to be active in
animals and humans as an anticonvulsant in 1962.3 It is a carboxylic acid clear liquid at room
temperature. VPA was first approved in France (1967) for use in humans as an anti-epileptic
medication.1
VPA attenuates the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in preclinical models4-9
and in humans10,11 especially during the acute treatment phase, although conflicting results
have been reported.12 This molecule has also shown intrinsic antiviral activity probably due
to its activity as histone deacetylase inhibitor.9,13-16 VPA has shown anti-inflammatory activity
in myocardial17 as well as neural tissue in models of brain and spinal cord injuries,18,19
although with some conflicting findings.20
Although long-term adverse effects and even pro-inflammatory consequences have
been reported with the chronic use of VPA,12 we believe that, given the urgent need to have

a useful drug to shorten the high mortality and LOS associated with COVID-19,21,22 the study
of the safety and efficacy of VPA in the treatment of COVID-19 is warranted from a
scientific standpoint.

Methods
Study type
Open-label proof-of-concept interventional study.

Hypothesis
Intravenous valproic acid will be safe and effective in the treatment of patients with
severe COVID-19.

Intervention
Sodium valproic acid will be given intravenously at a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day and up to
60/kg/day as needed to reach plasma valproic acid concentration of 50-100 µg/mL (measured
every 72 h). Three equal doses per day given intravenously in infusions lasting 60 min in 250
mL normal saline.

Recruitment strategy
Consecutive patients needing IMV and meeting selection criteria will be given i.v. valproic
acid for 10 days maintaining a plasma concentration of 50-100 µg/mL (measured every 72 h).
These patients will be followed-up for 10 days for the primary outcome and for a further
period of 30 days after treatment completion.

Safety outcomes
The most important acute side effects of valproic acid that should be meticulously on a daily
basis examined are:
• Acute liver failure, defined as the severe acute liver injury with encephalopathy and
impaired synthetic function (international normalized ratio ≥1.5) in a subject free of
preexistent chronic liver disease.
• Acute pancreatitis, defined as the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA)23
guidelines: the presence of two out of three of the following characteristics: a)
abdominal pain consistent with the disease, b) serum amylase and/or lipase activity >3
times the upper limit of normal, and c) characteristic findings on abdominal imaging.
• Thrombocytopenia, defined as the platelet blood count <50,000 per µL.
• Hypertransaminasemia, defined as the elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or
aspartate transaminase (AST) activity in serum, >3 times the upper normal limit of
the laboratory reference.

As stated in the selection criteria, patients with the current use of anti-epileptics are
allowed to be recruited, criteria that may include patients with epilepsy. In case of the
need of other anti-epileptics to treat new or recurrent seizures, the inclusion of such
medications will be a prerogative of the treating physician team. The investigational team
of this trial will reinforce the maintenance of the patient in the study, by helping in the
selection of anti-epileptics with no known adverse interactions with VPA, but in any
particular case of perceived harm that may arise with the interaction of VPA with other
anti-epileptics, the patient will be removed from the study.

Study duration
Ten days of i.v. treatment for the primary outcome, plus 30 days for the secondary outcome
of COVID-19 recurrence, given a total of 40 days of follow-up.

Major statistical hypothesis
There will be at least a 50% reduction of death of patients with severe COVID-19 needing
invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).

Sample size
This is a proof-of-concept study, therefore, sample size calculation was performed by using
the formula for the difference of proportions with a known (previous) proportion, and

assuming a high magnitude of the efficacy of the study drug, since, given the contingency of
this pandemics, minor effect sizes reductions are not desirable.
According to the most extensive information available today on 1,591 Italian patients
with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU,24 it is expected a 40% CFR final disposition of
patients, according to Bayesian analysis (the original information reports 26% CFR, but 58%
of patients still in ICU as of the analysis deadline of March 25, 2020). Hence, the sample size
was calculated to detect a minimum of (but not restricted to) 50% reduction in the CFR
from 40% to 20%, with 80% study power and 5% type I error.
Therefore, a sample size of at least (but not restricted to) 43 patients will be needed
to demonstrate an absolute (not RRR) reduction of 50% in CFR. No excess sample size was
considered to cover study losses since ITT analysis requires that drop-outs are considered
as failures to achieve study outcomes.

Statistical plan
ITT analyses will be performed considering all patients removed from the study for any
reason as treatment failures. Per protocol (PP) analyses will also be performed considering in
the calculations only patients with complete information and complete treatment schemes,
but the analyses on the PP population will only be considered as hypothesis-generating to
further pursue the study objectives with another robust design. Daily patients inspections
will be performed in order to demonstrate first that valproic acid is not harmful, to review
plasma levels (measured every 72 h), and clinical response. With this information, on a daily
basis, statistical analyses will be performed for outcome differences by using chi-squared
tests for categorical variables and hazard ratios to obtain effect sizes of study outcomes

(primary and secondary outcomes), as well as safety outcomes. After completion of the
study (either as per protocol or prematurely terminated), actuarial analyses with the KaplanMeier method will be performed for each study outcome to illustrate effect differences. All
analyses performed will be two-tailed and wondered as significant when p<0.05.

Interim analyses and termination rules
This study will be terminated as per protocol when at least 43 patients complete 10 days of
i.v. valproic acid therapy.
Premature termination will be executed when the following events occur:
• Since only a high effect size (>50%) in reducing death will be considered worthwhile
to pursue further clinical study on valproic acid activity on COVID-19, the outcome
rate boundary to terminate prematurely this proof-of-concept study will be 10
deaths occurred in ventilated patients.
• A rate of acute side effects (either thrombocytopenia, acute liver disease or acute
pancreatic injury) exceeding 4 cases (10% event rate) will be considered unacceptable
and will lead to premature termination, given that this rate exceeds the expected,
given the current information on critically-ill patients exposed to valproic acid to
treat epilepsy and status epilepticus.

Conclusions
It is necessary for a useful drug to treat COVID-19 and its consequences. Given that it is
expected the duration of a long-lasting pandemic,25 it can be supposed that we will have

several ways to treat this disease, to improve several clinical outcomes of importance to
eventually stop the direct sanitary implications and the very high economic burden that the
COVId-19 pandemics has caused. Although long-term adverse effects and even proinflammatory consequences have been reported with the chronic use of VPA, given the
urgent need for a drug active against COVID-19 to shorten the high mortality and LOS, the
study of VPA is justified from a scientific standpoint.
