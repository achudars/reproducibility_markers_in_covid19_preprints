Abstract
Crude case fatality rate (CFR) is the most accurate when the pandemic is over. Adjustments to
the crude CFR measure can better explain the pandemic situation by improving the CFR
estimation. However, no study has thoroughly investigated COVID-19 adjusted CFR of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. In this study, we
estimated both survival interval and underreporting adjusted CFR of COVID-19 for the SAARC
countries and observed the CFR changes due to the imposition of fees on COVID-19 tests in
Bangladesh. Using the daily records up to 9th October, we implemented a statistical method to
remove both the bias in crude CFR, i.e., the delay between disease onset and outcome bias and
due to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic cases, reporting rates lower than 50% (95% CI: 10%50%) bias. According to our findings, Afghanistan had the highest CFR, followed by Pakistan,
India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. Our estimated crude CFR varied from 3.71%
to 0.29%, survival interval adjusted CFR varied from 3.77% to 0.3% and further underreporting
adjusted CFR varied from 1.1% to 0.08%. We have also found that crude CFR increased from
1.261% to 1.572% after imposing the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh. Therefore, the
authorities of countries with higher CFR should be looking for strategic counsel from the
countries with lower CFR to equip themselves with the necessary knowledge to combat the
pandemic. Moreover, caution is needed to report the CFR.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, and the outbreak went global within three months of
being first discovered. The disease kept spreading so uncontrollably that even the most adequate
healthcare systems around the world were overwhelmed by it. Developing countries are
struggling even more [1]. The nature of the disease forced the world to ask questions about the
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of this disease [2]. CFR is an important readout to understand the
pandemic severity, and, in the media, CFR is often used to describe the situation regarding
COVID-19, as well as any other pandemic. However, during a pandemic, CFR can be
misleading [3]. The CFR of a disease is the total number of deaths divided by the total number of
cases, i.e., the ratio of fatal cases of a specified condition within a specified time [4]. In CFR
calculation during a pandemic, cases might be defined as the total number of confirmed cases,
which does not account for the delay between onset of the disease symptoms and outcome, i.e.,
recovery or death. Therefore, the CFR calculation becomes an underestimate of the actual CFR.
By contrast, if we only consider the closed cases where patients have either recovered or died,
the real-time CFR estimate remains consistently high throughout [5]. While the crude CFR can
give us an approximate idea about the risk of death during the pandemic, it is the most accurate
after the pandemic is over [6]. An adjustment to the crude CFR measure can significantly
improve the CFR estimates and give us a better idea about the pandemic situation [7].
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) (2.3%) [8], Lim et al.
(approximately 1-2%) [9] and He et al. (2.72% with 95% CI:1.29% 4.16%) [10] estimated the
CFR of COVID-19. However, different geographical areas, such as East Asian and Central
European countries, differ in the CFR of COVID-19 [11,12]. A study from April 2020 found that
the CFR of COVID-19 in Italy was 10.8%, while in Germany, it was just 0.7% [13]. The
variation in preventive measures and government policies can be responsible for this difference
in CFR [9,14]. For example, about three months into the COVID-19 outbreak, the Bangladesh
government inflicted fees on COVID-19 tests on all government labs and hospitals from June 30.
Prior to that, all government-run facilities offered COVID-19 tests for free, and 90% of all the
whole country's tests were being conducted on government-controlled sites [15]. The imposition
of fees on COVID-19 testing made Bangladesh the only country to do so among all South Asian
countries. The Bangladesh government's official stance was that fees were inflicted to ensure
better management and discourage unnecessary tests. Health Experts in Bangladesh believed the
imposition of any fee on Covid-19 tests might increase the outbreak size [16â€“18].
The CFR difference for different countries can provide much-needed information to combatting
the pandemic, such as what factors are responsible for speeding up or slowing the outbreak's
progression. Moreover, it will give us a better idea about the fatality rate of COVID-19 of the
countries of interest. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to calculate the CFR of a country
with a high degree of representativeness, highlighting the importance of calculating adjusted
CFR. However, no study has thoroughly investigated COVID-19 adjusted CFR of SAARC
countries, a regional union of eight nationsâ€”Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Therefore, this study's objective was to calculate and compare
the COVID-19 CFR for SAARC countries adjusted by the disease's survival interval and
reporting rates. Moreover, we explore the COVID-19 CFR of Bangladesh before and after the
test fees imposition.

2. Material and methods
We collected the daily record of confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 of all
member countries of SAARC up to October 9, 2020. Bhutan was not considered in this study
since, curiously, no death has been recorded there at all due to COVID-19. Then crude CFR,
based on confirmed cases at the time point , was calculated as

 100

Then we adjusted the crude CFR value by considering the survival interval of COVID-19. As
during any point of an ongoing epidemic, the denominator of the crude CFR contains the total
number of patients, some of whom may yet fall to their demise due to the disease. The deaths yet
to happen cannot possibly be considered in the calculation of CFR. Therefore, we applied a
statistical technique to reduce the bias in the crude CFR calculation. The technique considered
the uncertainty related to the variability of the interval between disease emergence and death by
enabling the probabilistic distribution of the survival interval to vary within a wide range. A
gamma distribution with a mean of 13.59 days and a standard deviation of 7.85 days (shape
parameter: a=2.99, rate parameter: b=0.22) was used to estimate the adjusted CFR [19]. To allow
the mean survival interval to vary between 2 to 6 weeks [20,21], the mean of the Gamma
distribution was sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 13.59 days and a standard
deviation of 2 days. Likewise, the standard deviation was sampled from a normal distribution
with a mean and a standard deviation of 7.85 days and 1 day, respectively. A maximum
likelihood method was then used to estimate the growth rate (r) of the COVID-19 outbreak in the
selected SAARC countries. In Monte-Carlo simulations (with 1000 independent replications),
Gamma distributionâ€™s moment generating function was used to calculate the correction factor

for the adjusted CFR on each calendar day [22]. Finally, we calculated the adjusted CFR using
the following formula:

Furthermore, assuming 50% lower reporting rates (95% CI 10%â€“ 50%) of COVID-19 [3,23] due
to the asymptomatic cases or exhibition of mild symptoms, we again adjusted the calculated
adjusted CFR. The probability of underreporting (â€« )Ý‘â€¬was sampled from a Beta distribution with
the shape parameter  = 10 and scale parameter  = 4 as,

that the daily reporting rates may vary from 10% to 50%. The 95% confidence interval for  was
0.5 - 0.9, while  was drawn in the range 0 - 1. The true incidence () was then estimated by:

Using the sampled incidence modified for a given probability of low reporting rates, we then
again estimated the adjusted CFR.

Figure 1 shows the crude CFR, adjusted CFR (accounted for the survival interval), and further
adjusted CFR (also considering reporting rates of less than 50%) of the selected South Asian
countries on 9 October 2020. In all three scenarios, Afghanistan had the highest CFR, and Sri
Lanka had the lowest. The crude CFR varied from 3.71% (Afghanistan) to 0.29% (Sri Lanka),
while adjusted CFR varied from 3.77% (95% CI: 3.71%-3.84%) to 0.3% (95% CI: 0.29%0.30%). When we further adjusted the CFR considering the underreported cases, the CFR varied
from 1.1% (95% CI: 1.07%-1.12%) to 0.08% (95% CI: 0.08%-0.09%).

period, whereas, for Sri Lanka, CFR considerably decreased over time. In Bangladesh, there was
a sharp spike in CFR, which became stable over time. Moreover, we found that crude CFR
increased from 1.261% to 1.572% after the imposition of the COVID-19 test fees in Bangladesh

4. Discussion
Understanding the case fatality rate of the COVID-19 allows policymakers to mitigate the
outbreak impact by implementing efficient and effective interventions for disease control.
Therefore, in this study, we estimated the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 outbreak for the selected
SAARC countries, i.e., Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri
Lanka. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive estimation for the COVID-19
CFR for these selected countries.
There was a difference in estimated CFRs of SAARC countries. Ranking the countries, we
observed the highest CFR in Afghanistan, followed by Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal,
Maldives, and Sri Lanka. The variation can be attributed to the public health system,
preparedness, and effective interventions of each country. For example, Sri Lanka has a free
public health system and has been ranked as 10th on Global Response to Infectious Disease while
Bangladesh is 80th [24].
According to our findings, the survival interval adjusted CFR values were slightly greater than
that of the respective countriesâ€™ crude CFR. The reason is that during an epidemic crude CFR
estimation becomes an underestimate of the actual CFR [5]. However, because of both limited
numbers of test and presence of asymptotic or mild cases, there exists unreported cases [25â€“28].
Therefore, after further adjustment for reporting rates lower than 50%, estimated CFRs became
less than one-third compared to crude CFR, and survival interval adjusted CFR. In agreement
with previous studies [29,30], our estimated CFRs for selected countries were lower than most of
the European countriesâ€™ CFR. Several factors, such as temperature, the proportion of young
people, genetic factors, can be responsible for this variation in CFR [12,14,31â€“33]. Moreover,
we found that CFR of the COVID-19 pandemic is less than SARS, MERS, Bird flu, and Ebola
[34,35]. However, as it is highly infectious, and there are many mild or asymptomatic cases,
public health concerns must be addressed.
In our estimation, the crude CFR of Bangladesh increased after the imposition of the COVID-19
test fees to discourage unnecessary tests, therefore, ensure better management. As a result, in the
first 10 days since the imposition of test fees, there had been a decrease of 8,736 tests in total
from the previous 10-day period. More tests can detect more asymptomatic or mild cases, which
reduced the mortality rate [12,14]. However, as the decision had affected the poor citizenâ€™s
ability or willingness of testing [18], the Bangladesh government decided to cut the test fees by
almost half on 20 August [36]. Since the government-imposed fee for COVID-19 is increasing
the country's CFR, immediate steps should be taken to remove the fees so that the tests are
affordable to everybody.

5. Limitations
The first limitation of this study is that the calculated case-fatality rates refer to the countriesâ€™
entire population. Patients with critical health condition, populations with a higher proportion of
older adults, inadequate resources and unorganized health care systems can have a higher CFR.
[12,37â€“39]. Second, we could not use country wise mean survival time of COVID-19 patients
for the adjusted CFR estimation. Third, we assumed that there were no age-specific and country-

specific differences in under-reporting. The children and youths with mild symptoms are tested
less often. Moreover, factors such as testing capacity, awareness about the importance of
reporting symptoms etc. directly affects the reporting rates of the disease [40]. It is recommended
that future researches on similar issues should consider improving on these limitations.

6. Conclusion
Survival intervals of the patients and a large number of underreported cases affect the CFR
estimation, therefore affecting the countries' policies. In this regard, the bias-adjusted CFR
measure can provide better information to health professionals and policymakers. Therefore,
survival interval and underreported cases should be considered while calculating COVID-19
CFR. This will equip us with much better knowledge of the COVID-19 scenario worldwide.
