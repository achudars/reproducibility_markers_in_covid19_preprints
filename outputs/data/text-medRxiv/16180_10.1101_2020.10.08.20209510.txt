ABSTRACT

41

BACKGROUND. Social distancing mandates (SDM) have reduced health impacts from COVID-19 but also

42

resulted in economic downturns that have led many nations to relax SDM. Until deployment of an

43

efficacious and equitable vaccine, intervention options to reduce COVID-19 mortality and minimize

44

restrictive SDM are sought by society.

45

METHODS. A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic transmission model was

46

parameterized with data on reported deaths, cases, and select covariates to predict infections and

47

deaths from COVID-19 through March 01, 2021. We explore three scenarios: a “non-adaptive” scenario

48

where neither mask use or SDM adapt to changing conditions, a “reference” where current national

49

levels of mask use are maintained and SDM reintroduced when deaths rise, and an increase in mask use

50

to 95% coverage levels (“universal mask”). We reviewed published studies to set priors on the

51

magnitude of reduction in transmission through increasing mask use.

52

RESULTS. Mask use was estimated at 59.0% of people globally on October 19, 2020. Universal mask use

53

could avert 733,310 deaths (95% UI 385,981 to 1,107,759) between October 27, 2020 and March 01,

54

2021, the difference between the predicted 2.95 million deaths (95% UI 2.70 to 3.35) in the reference

55

scenario and 2.22 million deaths (95% UI 2.00 to 2.45) in the universal mask scenario over this time

56

period.

57

CONCLUSIONS. The cumulative toll of the COVID-19 pandemic could be substantially reduced by the

58

universal adoption of masks before the availability of a vaccine. This low-cost, low-barrier policy,

59

whether customary or mandated, has enormous health benefits with presumed marginal economic

60

costs.

62

COVID-19 has spread to all regions of the world and as of October 25, 2020 nearly 43 million cases and

63

1,1953,034 deaths have been reported globally.1 In March 2020, nearly all nations put in place various

64

social distancing mandates (SDM) (Figure 1) that have contributed to reducing the effects of COVID-19.2–

65

5

66

progressively relax SDM. As COVID-19 transmission and deaths rise globally and rebound in many

67

countries,1 policymakers are keen to identify policy options to reduce COVID-19 mortality without re-

68

imposing strict SDM before the widespread implantation of a vaccine.

69

Despite welcome news on vaccine development and efficacy of some candidates,6,7 safety, regulatory,

70

manufacturing and distribution hurdles all need to be overcome before there will be an impact at scale.8

71

One existing and attractive strategy is the wearing of masks in public spaces or when physical distancing

72

may not be possible. Several systematic reviews have suggested that cloth and other non-medical masks

73

worn by the general public can reduce transmission.9,10 Moreover, simple non-medical masks are

74

affordable and equitably accessible. Consequently, a growing number of national and local governments

75

have recommended mask use , with more than 150 countries now mandating mask use.11 In nations

76

such as the United States (US) and Brazil, mask use has become politicized, with widely varying views on

77

the ethics, legality, and enforcement of mask use and mask use mandates.12,13 Evidence of the individual

78

benefits and population health impacts of increased mask use is still extremely pertinent to these

79

debates.

80

Masks reduce the transmission of respiratory pathogens via a physical barrier; the force of exhalation,

81

coughing, or sneezing leads to impaction and interception of viral droplets (> 5µm in diameter) and

82

aerosols (≤ 5 µm in diameter) onto the fibers of the mask.14–16 Given greater impaction efficiency for

83

droplets, masks are most effective in blocking outward exhalation,17 although evidence from studies of

84

air pollution aerosol indicates some protection of non-medical masks in blocking a small fraction of

The economic downturns associated with these measures subsequently led most nations to

85

aerosol inhalation.18 Thus mask wearing is effective in intercepting particle emissions from the infected

86

and reducing large particle transmission to the uninfected.19

87

In this paper, we use online survey data to assess current levels and trends in use of masks at the

88

national level for 194 countries and quantify the benefits of universal mask use (here defined as 95% of

89

individuals always wearing a mask when outside their home) on COVID-19 mortality in these countries

90

using a COVID-19 transmission dynamics model. We then provide global and national estimates of lives

91

saved through universal mask use between October 27, 2020 and March 01, 2021.

92

Methods

93

Our analysis is comprised of two main components: an analysis of survey data on the levels and trends

94

in mask use; and a deterministic transmission dynamics model with categories for susceptible, exposed,

95

infected and recovered (SEIR) model of COVID-19 incidence and death. We explore three scenarios in

96

the SEIR model: 1) a “non-adaptive” where mask use and SDM remain constant 2) a plausible “reference

97

scenario” where SDMs are reinstated at a threshold level of daily deaths and current levels of mask use

98

maintained and 3) a “universal mask” scenario based on the adoption of universal mask use at 95%

99

coverage.

100

We used four main sources of data on self-reported use of masks to estimate past and current mask use

101

globally, and make forecasts for future use: Facebook Global Symptom Survey,20 Facebook US Symptom

102

Survey21, PREMISE surveys,22 and YouGov COVID-19 Behaviour Tracker surveys.23 Pooling estimates on

103

the prevalence of self-reported mask use from these survey series provides a time series on trends in

104

mask use in almost all countries. Between April 23, 2020 and October 19, 2020, Facebook has surveyed

105

30.86 million users from 198 countries and territories using an instrument with multiple items on

106

behaviors related to COVID-19, including mask use. The YouGov surveys cover 29 countries and

107

represent interviews with approximately 726,500 individuals since March 01, 2020 up until October 24,

2020. For the US, we used data collected through PREMISE and Facebook to inform the trend in mask

109

use. There were 273,424 total PREMISE responses representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia

110

with responses collected between April 21 and October 26. Facebook symptom surveys in the US started

111

asking about mask use in the beginning of September (data range from September 8 to October 20) and

112

included 1,813,000 respondents. Levels of mask use as reported by PREMISE are on average 30% lower

113

across the USA compared to data from Facebook and YouGov, but other data sources do not provide a

114

time trend in mask use. Therefore, we use the time trend implied by the PREMISE data and apply it to

115

the level of mask use reported in the Facebook data. Details on the specific questions and responses

116

used from each survey are identified in the Supplementary Appendix.

117

Mask use for each location was estimated using a spline-based smoothing process. For locations without

118

data on mask use, we used national level estimates or regional estimates (see Supplementary Appendix

119

for additional details).

COVID-19 SEIR model construction

122

SEIR model for each location we model; the Supplementary Appendix shows the basic health states

included in the model and specific transition parameters. The critical driver of the epidemic is the rate at

124

which susceptible individuals become infected in each location which is represented as:

susceptible. We use an efficient algorithm to directly estimate βt in the past – see Supplementary

130

Appendix for details.

131

The following covariates are included in the model: population density measured as the share of the

132

population living in areas with more than 2,500 individuals per square kilometer, the fraction of the

133

population living below 100 meters above sea level, smoking prevalence, particulate matter air pollution

134

(PM2.5 population-weighted annual average concentration), mobility measured using cell phone apps,

135

mask use, COVID-19 testing per capita, and pneumonia seasonality.24 To avoid over-estimating the

136

effects of pneumonia seasonality and mask use we used constraints on each in the regression – see

137

Supplementary Appendix for details. Specifically, for mask use, we did not let the regression estimate an

138

effect size larger than what was consistent with the mask use meta-analysis of the individual level effect

139

(Supplementary Appendix). To capture uncertainty in the input data, model parameters and regression

140

coefficients linking βjt to covariates, we generated 1,000 models for each location – see Supplementary

141

Appendix for details.

142

We evaluated out of sample predictive validity for this modeling approach by holding out the last twelve

143

weeks of data and compared predictions from the held-out data to what occurred; median absolute

144

percent error for cumulative deaths at six weeks was 11% and twelve weeks was 24%.25 We also

145

compared this model to other COVID-19 prediction models that make their estimates publicly available;

146

overall, we find that our model is one of the best performing models at 12-weeks out-of-sample.25

the plausible reference scenario key drivers such as mobility and testing per capita evolve according to

past trends – see Supplementary Appendix for details. In the universal mask use scenario, we

We used the set of 1,000 SEIR models for each location to generate three scenarios: a plausible

additionally assume that mask mandates and other campaigns lead to scale-up of mask use to 95%

153

within 7 days of enactment; this represents the highest reported level of mask use (in Victoria, Australia

154

Singapore) across the three survey platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic up to mid-October; other

155

locations including Chile, Peru, and Spain have also approached this 95% coverage level from previous

156

very low levels of coverage. The “universal mask” scenario assumes this level of mask use can be

157

achieved through the adoption of mask use around the world. Both the reference and universal mask

158

use scenarios additionally assume that SDM will be re-instated for 6 weeks if the daily death rate per

159

location reaches 8 per million people per day.26 Finally, we estimate the trajectory of the epidemic in

160

each location if SDM are not reinstated in response to changing pandemic conditions (“non-adaptive

161

scenario”).

Our study follows the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimate Reporting. Data were

163

not obtained from subjects for this study; we used pre-existing datasets identified through online

164

searches, through outreach to institutions that hold relevant data such as ministries of health, or

165

through individual collaborator reference and identification. This study was approved by University of

166

175

is high in several locations that were at the forefront of the COVID-19 peak in the spring of 2020

176

including Italy, Spain, and most parts of Latin America (i.e. Chile, and Panama). The highest national

177

mask use on October 19, 2020 was in Spain (93.9%), followed by Puerto Rico (92.6%), and Panama

178

(92.5%). The lowest rates are seen in Northern Europe (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark < 4%) and East

179

Africa (United Republic of Tanzania 2.1%). On October 19, women were more likely to report always

180

wearing a mask (64% women, 58% men), with pronounced sex differences in sub-Saharan Africa, Central

181

and Eastern Europe and Central Asia (See Supplementary Appendix). Mask use was highest among

182

people who live in cities and towns (about 60%) and lowest in rural communities (less than 50%; see

183

Supplementary Appendix). People over 65 years (56.4%) and young adults 18-24 (56.7%) were the least

184

likely age groups to report always wearing a mask (other adult age groups were over 60% at the global

185

level; see Supplementary Appendix).

186

Figure 4 shows the global and WHO regional trends in mask use since the beginning of the epidemic.

187

Mask use data start only in the beginning of April so the rapid expansion from likely a very low baseline

188

pre-COVID-19 outside of East Asia most probably occurred in March. Mask use was estimated at 59.0%

189

of people globally on October 19, 2020, ranging from 36.0% in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to

190

72.2% in the Region of the Americas (Figure 4). Mask use has increased in some countries where

191

mandates have been put into place such as Belgium, Ireland and the Ethiopia (SI Figure 7). Mask use has

192

declined in some settings in parallel with declining death rates such as Poland, Czechia, and Italy (SI

193

Figure 7).

194

Global projections of COVID-19 deaths with and without adoption of universal mask use are shown in

195

Figure 5. In our reference scenario, we expect daily COVID-19 deaths to increase in November through

196

December leading to as many as 2.95 million deaths (95% UI 2.70 million to 3.35 million) by March 01,

197

2021. Uncertainty in daily deaths and cumulative deaths increases over time such that there is

198

considerable uncertainty in global deaths by March 01, 2021. In contrast, the universal mask use

199

scenario leads to a mean estimate of 2.22 million deaths (95% UI 2.00 million to 2.45 million) by March

200

01, 2021. The difference in mortality between the reference and universal mask use scenario suggests

201

that 0.73 million lives (95% UI 0.39 million to 1.11 million) could be saved over this time period if 95% of

202

people were to always wear masks when outside their home. Table 1 provides estimates by location of

203

the expected deaths in the reference and universal mask use scenario along with the number of deaths

204

saved through universal mask use. The countries where universal mask use would have the largest effect

205

are populous nations where mask use is currently relatively low such as India (104,301 fewer deaths in

206

universal mask scenario, 95% UI 60,679 to 151,873 deaths), the Germany (90,005 fewer deaths; 95% UI

207

27,524 to 190,010 deaths), and United States of America (82,150 fewer deaths; 95% UI 46,079 to

208

116,120 deaths). The greatest magnitude difference in mortality rate occurred in the Czechia (12,419

209

fewer deaths, 117 deaths per 100,000), Germany (90,005 fewer deaths, 106 deaths per 100,000) and

210

Croatia (3,879 fewer deaths, 91 deaths per 100,000).

211

Figure 6 shows a map of the percent reduction in expected deaths from the reference scenario

212

compared to the mask use scenario in the deaths from October 27, 2020 to March 01, 2021. The largest

213

percent reduction in expected deaths occurred in Belarus (76.8% difference, 95% UI 66.9 to 82.3%),

214

Denmark (76.1% difference, 95% UI 61.1 to 87.3%), and Uganda (75.4% difference, 95% UI 38.4 to

215

97.0%). There are large variations in the number of lives saved globally, regionally, nationally, and

216

subnationally and these are detailed in full in Table 1.

217

Discussion

218

Given global mask use is currently at 59.0%, increasing mask use to 95% could decrease cumulative

219

COVID-19 deaths by March 01, 2021 by 0.73 million deaths (95% UI 0.39 to 1.11 million). This represents

220

a 24.8% reduction in the number of deaths expected from October 27, 2020 to March 01, 2021. Our

221

models also show that in many settings, increased mask use could delay the need re-imposition of SDM;

222

in addition to the lives saved, a delay in re-imposition of social mandates might also be accompanied by

223

substantial economic benefits, although this was not specifically modelled.

224

The published studies of SARS-CoV-2 included in our analysis of mask effectiveness (see Supplementary

225

Appendix for details) demonstrated reductions in relative risk of 30% - 100%, with the one study of non-

226

medical mask use amongst the general population, indicating a reduction of 42% for any mask use and

227

70% for consistent mask use.27 Mask effectiveness is also supported by additional evidence from case

228

studies28–30 and from laboratory studies that report on the efficacy of masks in reducing exhalation of

229

both aerosols and droplets by those infected with SARS CoV-2.31 Based on all types of available

230

evidence, it seems wise to encourage mask use throughout the world as the benefits can be substantial

231

with low to zero contraindications. Guidance for specific materials, handling of face coverings and other

232

considerations is rapidly evolving as additional evidence emerges.32

233

Given that the cost of masks is very low, mask mandates and/or the promotion of mask use seems

234

prudent, as the risk of adopting these policies is minimal and the potential benefits very large. In

235

recognition of this, over the last few months we have seen the number of countries and territories with

236

mask mandates in place increase substantially. Nevertheless, there remains reluctance to adopt mask

237

use and to impose mask mandates. In some settings, the current epidemiological context means that

238

mask wearing is not viewed as a necessary part of control, such as in Norway where the Norwegian

239

Institute of Public Health determined that, given their current low prevalence, “200,000 people would

240

need to wear facemasks to prevent one new infection per week”.33 In other settings however, despite

241

increasing cases, public sentiment towards mask wearing hinders universal use. Past messages from

242

some governments have not encouraged mask use and may have actually discouraged mask use.34–36

243

Early on, WHO stated “the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not

244

supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks” and only changed their

245

official position on June 5th to encourage mask use.38 For those decision-makers who are concerned with

246

the economic effects of SDM, mask use provides a low-cost strategy to reduce the risk of a further round

247

of SDM and the associated unemployment and economic downturn. Mask use scaled up rapidly in some

248

locations following mandated use. For example, at the start of July, mask use in Victoria state Australia

249

was less than 10% but following a mask mandate in that month, mask use exceeded 90% in early August.

250

While the effective R, the number of new infections created by a single infection under the auspices of

251

control, can potentially be reduced by one-third through universal mask use compared to a reference

252

scenario, mask use alone will likely be insufficient to control the epidemic in many locations. Even with

253

universal mask use, we expect the global death toll due to COVID-19 to reach as high as 1.71 million

254

deaths by the end of the year, and many more in 2021, assuming an efficacious vaccine is not widely

255

deployed in the interim. Despite encouraging news of candidates,6,7 safety procedures, regulatory

256

approval, and the problems of manufacturing and distribution at scale will likely delay the potential for

257

widespread impact.8 Countries will have to consider other policy strategies to reduce transmission,

258

including increasing testing, contact tracing, and isolation, along with “smart mandates”, that target

259

SDM or restrictions to particular subgroups of the population, such as specific age-groups or local

260

communities for short periods of time. A central policy challenge for many countries is understanding

261

which of these mandates targeting strategies makes the most sense in a given context and at what level

262

of COVID-19 transmission. This is the focus of our ongoing work.

263

The findings of this study should be interpreted while taking into account its limitations (further

264

elaborated in the Supplementary Appendix): (i) the number of studies on general mask use in the

265

population remains low; (ii) all the assumption of any type of SEIR model are also applicable here;24

266

prediction accuracy is highly spatially variable and compound into the future;25 (iv) death reporting

267

globally is subject to regionally and nationally specific errors and biases for which we cannot fully

268

control; (v) models is sensitive to death trend in last 7-14 days and (vi) self-reported mask use by surveys

269

will also have an set of errors and biases that are not completely known.

270

Universal mask use can save many lives and avoid or delay the need for re-imposition of SDM. This will

271

contribute to ameliorating the negative effects of COVID-19 on national economies. Until an affordable

272

and effective vaccine becomes universally available, we find encouraging or mandating mask use is the

273

least disruptive policy option available to countries currently experiences resurgences in infections and

274

deaths. Simple face coverings are cheap and effective; one of the few available interventions that is

275

widely available to everyone. Countries with currently low mask use will need to determine the optimal

276

balance between encouraging the use of masks through advocacy and information about their benefits,

277

and governance of a compulsory use associated with penalties for non-compliance.39
