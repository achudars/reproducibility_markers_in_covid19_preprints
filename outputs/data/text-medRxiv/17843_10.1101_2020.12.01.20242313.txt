Abstract
Background: One major micronutrient known to have a possible protective effect against
COVID-19 disease is vitamin D. This systematic review sought to identify and synthesise
available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect of vitamin D deficiency on
COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

Methods: Three databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched
systematically to obtain English language journal article published within 1/12/2019 and
3/11/2020. The search consisted of the terms ("Vitamin D," OR "25Hydroxyvitamin D," OR
"Low Vitamin D.") AND ("COVID-19" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "Coronavirus" OR "SARS-CoV2") AND ("disease severity" OR "IMV" OR "ICU admission" OR "mortality" OR
"hospitalization" OR "infection"). We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines in
executing this study. After going through the screening of the articles, eleven articles were
included in the review.

Findings: Almost all the included studies reported a positive association between Vitamin D
sufficiency and COVID-19 status and health outcomes. Vitamin D deficient patients (< 25
ng/mL) are 5.84 times [aOR=6.84, p=0.01] more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the
vitamin D sufficient people. Another study also found that Vitamin D deficiency is associated
with higher risk of death with Hazard ratio (HR) 14.73, p<0.001. Vitamin D deficient (<12
ng/mL) people were 2.2 times [aOR=3.2, p=0.07] more likely to develop severe COVID-19 after
adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease compared to the vitamin D
sufficient people. One study found that after controlling for confounders, patients with low

compared to the patients with 25(OH)D level >=30 ng/mL.

Conclusion: Findings from the study included suggest Vitamin D may serve as a mitigating
effect for covid-19 infection, severity and mortality. We recommend the need to encourage
people to eat foods rich in vitamin D such as fish, red meat, liver and egg yolks whiles at the
same time providing vitamin D supplements for individuals with COVID-19 in order to boost
their immune systems.

Introduction
As of 10th November, 2020, approximately 50 million confirmed cases and 1.2 million COVID19 related deaths had been reported globally (WHO, 2020). There is a seemingly sharp rise in the
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in many countries, in what has been described as the
“second wave” of the global pandemic (Looi, 2020). For instance, between September and
October, 2020, a number of European countries including Belgium, Germany, France, Spain,
Czech Republic and Ireland had reported exponential increases in the daily number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases (Looi, 2020). This resurgence of the disease could be attributed to the
relaxation of preventive measures such as lockdowns, physical distancing, wearing of nose
masks and the general disregard to precautionary behaviours among the populace (Aleta et al.,
2020; Leung et al., 2020). Therefore, in the absence of effective pharmacologic therapy and
vaccines, it is important to investigate the role of immune boosters such as micronutrients
(vitamins and minerals) in mitigating or preventing the adverse effect of the COVID-19 disease
(Laird, & Kenny, 2020; Richardson, & Lovegrove, 2020).
One major micronutrient known to have a possible protective or mitigating effect against
COVID-19 disease is vitamin D (Ebadi, & Montano-Loza, 2020; Grant et al., 2020; McCartney,
& Byrne, 2020), a naturally occurring vitamin in humans, which is mostly produced in the skin
after an exposure to ultraviolent radiation from the sun (Di Rosa et al., 2011). Because COVID19 is associated with immune hyperactivation (Zhong et al., 2020), the protective effect of
vitamin D had been attributed to its ability to suppress immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2
virus (Panarese, & Shahini, 2020) and thereby reducing the risk or severity of acute respiratory

distress syndrome, a cardinal sign of severe COVID-19 (Grasselli et al., 2020; Zhong et al.,
2020). Relatedly, vitamin D deficiency had been associated with increasing risk for immunemediated and inflammatory disorders including diseases of the respiratory and digestive systems
(Di Rosa et al., 2011). For example, many observational studies have shown a significant
association between low serum levels of vitamin D and increased risk for acute respiratory tract
infections (Ginde et al., 2009; Jolliffe et al., 2013). Additionally, a randomised controlled trial
had shown that vitamin D supplementation for patients at high risk of respiratory tract infection
reduced symptoms and need for antibiotic therapy (Bergman et a., 2012).
Aside its importance in immune modulation (Bergman et al., 2012; Di Rosa et al., 2011) during
early and late phases of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (Martineau, & Forouhi, 2020), the effect of
vitamin D on health outcomes among COVID-19 patients largely remain inconclusive (Ali,
2020; Martineau, & Forouhi, 2020). One major postulate on the possible association of vitamin
D deficiency and COVID-19 disease is the high morbidity and mortality recorded among aged
population, who are more likely to have lower serum levels of vitamin D (Ebadi, & MontanoLoza, 2020; Laird, & Kenny, 2020). For instance, Ilie et al. (2020) reported that aged population
in countries with higher levels of COVID-19 mortality such as Italy and Spain had significantly
lower mean serum levels of vitamin D. Additionally, both severe COVID-19 and vitamin D
deficiency had been associated with common risk factors such as old age, obesity, and being of
Asian or black ethnic descent (Martineau, & Forouhi, 2020). Thus, considering the numerous
findings from observational studies on a possible association between vitamin D deficiency and
the incidence or severity of COVID-19 disease, we conducted a systematic review with the aim
of identifying and synthesising available evidence to aid the understanding of the possible effect
of vitamin D deficiency on COVID-19 status and health outcomes in COVID-19 patients.

Methods
Search strategy
Three databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched systematically to
obtain English language journal article published within 1/12/2019 and 3/11/2020. The search
consisted of the terms ("Vitamin D," OR "25Hydroxyvitamin D," OR "Low Vitamin D.")
AND ("COVID-19" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "Coronavirus" OR "SARS-CoV-2") AND ("disease
severity" OR "IMV" OR "ICU admission" OR "mortality" OR "hospitalization" OR "infection").
More details regarding search strategy are presented in Table S1-S3 in the supplementary file.

Eligibility Criteria
The studies which dealt with Vitamin D deficiency and assessed outcome of COVID-19
infection, severity, and death among the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) or according to the country specific criteria or laboratory confirmed COVID19 patients were included. Only peer reviewed journal articles written in English language were
included. So unpublished studies, preprints, and articles written in languages except English
were excluded. Only studies which are cross-sectional or cohort or case-control study in nature
were included. Hence, randomized controlled trails, short communication, letter to the editor,
review articles etc. were excluded.

Data extraction and study quality assessment
After finding pertinent articles by using the inclusion and exclusion criteria, quality of the
articles was assessed. Newcastle-Ottawa technique of assessing study quality of cross-sectional
study, cohort study and case-control study were used to measure the quality of the crosssectional, cohort, and case-control studies respectively. Studies with quality score of at least 5,
for each study design, were selected for data extraction. Name of the first author, study design,
country name, sample size, mean/median age/age interval of the included participants, how
vitamin D deficiency was defined, outcome assessed, and main findings were extracted from the
included studies.

Results
Search results
Through searching the databases; PubMed, Goggle Scholar, and ScienceDirect, 135, 2630, and 9
articles were identified respectively (figure 1). So the titles and abstracts of 2774 articles were
initially screened. Through the screening 17 articles were selected for full text screening. After
the full text screening of 17 articles 3 articles were excluded due to mismatch of the study
design. Then from rest of the eligible articles 3 articles were excluded due to lack of information
and duplication. Finally, for qualitative synthesis, 11 articles were included.

Findings from all the studies
The study by Abrishami et al found that vitamin D deficient patients (< 25 ng/mL) are 5.84 times
[aOR=6.84, p=0.01] more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the vitamin D sufficient
people (Table 2). Similarly the study by Radujkovic et al. found that Vitamin D deficiency is
associated with higher risk of death with Hazard ratio (HR) 14.73, p<0.001.
The result of the study by Maghbooli et al says that among the COVID-19 patients, vitamin D
deficient (<30 ng/mL) patients have more risk of developing severe infection compared to the
vitamin D sufficient (>=30 ng/mL) patients. Similarly, the study by Otros et al. found that
vitamin D deficient (<12 ng/mL) people are 2.2 times [aOR=3.2, p=0.07] more likely to develop
severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease
compare to the vitamin D sufficient people. Furthermore, the study by Ye et al. found that Serum
25(OH)D levels in severe/critical COVID-19 cases (38.2 nmol/L) are significantly lower than
that in mild/moderate cases (56.6 nmol/L).
The study by Merzon et al. found that after controlling for confounders, patients with low
25(OH)D (<30 ng/mL) level are more likely [aOR=1.45, p=<0.001] to be COVID-19 infected
compare to the patients with 25(OH)D level >=30 ng/mL. Meltzer et al. found that patients with
likely deficient vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing have more risk of testing
positive for COVID-19 (RR= 1.77; 95%CI, 1.12-2.81; p = .02) compared to the patients with
likely sufficient status at the time of COVID-19 testing. Similarly, Kaufman et al. found that the
SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate is lower in patients with “adequate” 25(OH) D values (30–34
ng/mL), than in patients with “deficiency” (<20 ng/mL) (difference 35%; p<0.001). The study
by D’avolio et al. observed significantly lower 25(OH) D levels (11.1 ng/mL) in patients positive

Baktash et al. observed that vitamin D levels in the COVID-19-positive group are overall
significantly lower compared with that in the COVID-19-negative group. Finally, the study by
Hastie et al. found that univariably vitamin D deficient people are more likely [OR=1.37,
p=0.011] to be COVID-19 infected compare to the vitamin D sufficient people but this relation is
not significant in the presence of the confounders. More findings from the included studies are
presented in table 2.

Discussion
The striking relationship between Vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 risk factors such as
obesity and older age has influenced some scholars and researchers to postulate that Vitamin D
supplements could be used as a preventive or protective agent against COVID-19 infection,
illness and mortality (Martineau, & Forouhi, 2020). Some researchers and clinicians have also
argued that since COVID-19 is associated with immune hyperactivation (Zhong et al., 2020),
Vitamin D regulates immunopathalogical inflammatory responses and support innate antiviral
effector mechanism (Martineau, & Forouhi, 2020). Zhong et al. (2020) and Panarese, & Shahini
(2020) independently report that Vitamin D acts as a protective effect against COVID-19
because it boosts immune system response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This has also led to a
substantial increase in the use of Vitamin D across the globe since the emergence of COVID-19.

Several studies (Baktash et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Kaufman et al., 2020) have investigated the
likely protective and mitigating effect of these supplements against COVID-19 infection and
mortality. We are contributing in this direction by performing this first systematic review of
existing evidence on the effect of Vitamin D on COVID-19 status. In all, a total of 11 studies
were included in the final analysis. Evidence in all the studies except Hastie and colleagues’
study suggest that Vitamin D has a protective or mitigating effect against COVID-19, either by
reducing the risk of contracting, becoming severely ill or dying from COVID-19. In other words,
patients who are Vitamin D sufficient are less likely to be infected or critically ill or die from the
COVID-19 and vice versa.
The uniformity of evidence in the included studies in our systematic review suggest that there is
a possibility that Vitamin D supplementation might reduce the impact of COVID-19 especially
in patients and populations with high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. It may also explain the
global increase in demand and utilization of food supplements especially Vitamin D across
healthcare and non-healthcare settings amid the COVID-19 pandemic (Ebadi, & Montano-Loza,
2020; Grant et al., 2020; McCartney, & Byrne, 2020). Though the evidence from the review is
positive and interesting, our discussion from the systematic review is driven from the relative
lack of scientific knowledge relating to biological explanation for the Vitamin D impacts on
COVID-19 status since only studies reporting likelihood were available and included. The
studies reviewed and included in the evidence synthesis are based on cross-sectional,
observational and prospective data and they do not provide indication of the relevant causative
agents and mechanisms through which Vitamin D serves as a protective or mitigating effect
against COVID-19. This limitation does not suggest that the evidence of positive association
between Vitamin D and COVID-19 status must be dismissed.

However, without indicating the causative agents and plausible mechanism in the included
studies, the level of confidence of the Vitamin D impact on COVID-19 status is moderate. This
is because if a COVID-19 patient is on Vitamin D, a number of factors will determine whether a
good effect is likely to occur. These factors will include dose, duration, age, gender, diet,
lifestyle state, state of health, among others. These confounding factors may prove important in
the Vitamin D and COVID-19 status association. Evidently, one of the studies selected and
included in this review (Hastie et al., 2020) show some uncertainties and also suggest that
confounders should be taken into consideration when discussing effect of Vitamin D on COVID19 status. The authors found that Vitamin D does not have significant relationship with COVID19 status in the presence of confounders. According to Martineau, and Forouhi (2020), results
from studies investigating the potential and actual impact of Vitamin D on COVID-19 status
appear conflicting to date partly due to the evidence that those studies are open to residual and
unmeasured confounding.
From this perspective, epidemiological and hospital-based studies, and well-designed and
powered randomised controlled trials are currently required to establish the actual effect of
Vitamin D on COVID-19 status and to also offer insights into the potential for reverse causality
(Martineau, & Forouhi, 2020). The design of such studies and trials should be informed by
findings of systematic reviews on Vitamin D effect on COVID-19 status such as the present
review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D.

Conclusion
Findings from the study included suggest Vitamin D may serve as a mitigating effect for covid19 infection, severity and mortality. We recommend the need to encourage people to eat foods
