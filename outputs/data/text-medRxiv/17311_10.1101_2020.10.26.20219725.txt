Abstract
Background
The prevalence and persistence of antibodies following a peak SARS-CoV-2 infection
provides insights into its spread in the community, the likelihood of reinfection and potential
for some level of population immunity.
Methods
Prevalence of antibody positivity in England, UK (REACT2) with three cross-sectional
surveys between late June and September 2020. 365104 adults used a self-administered
lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG. A laboratory comparison of LFIA results to
neutralization activity in panel of sera was performed.
Results
There were 17,576 positive tests over the three rounds. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for test
characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0% [5.8,
6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.0] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.5% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three
months of the study. There was a decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the
highest prevalence of a positive result and smallest overall decline in positivity in the
youngest age group (18-24 years: -14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]), and lowest prevalence and largest
decline in the oldest group (75+ years: -39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]); there was no change in
antibody positivity between rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]).
The decline from rounds 1 to 3 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID19, (-64.0% [-75.6, -52.3]), compared to -22.3% ([-27.0, -17.7]) in those with SARS-CoV-2
infection confirmed on PCR.

Discussion
These findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over time such
that, at the start of the second wave of infection in England, only 4.4% of adults had
detectable IgG antibodies using an LFIA. Antibody positivity was greater in those who
reported a positive PCR and lower in older people and those with asymptomatic infection.
These data suggest the possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of
reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population.

Background
National prevalence surveys of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies provide critical insight into the
extent that a population has been exposed to infection and may inform understanding of the
future course of the epidemic.1 Studies in Iceland2 and Spain3 found quite different levels of
population antibody positivity, with evidence of durable antibody response over 4 months
from time of infection seen in Iceland. Meanwhile, cohort studies have suggested that
antibody levels in individuals may fall substantially with time after infection, influenced by
factors such as the severity of initial illness, age and co-morbidities.4–9
Changes in population antibody prevalence over time will be a complex interaction between
the incidence of new infections and waning of antibody levels in those previously infected.
Sequential antibody prevalence surveys can offer insight into the durability of antibody
responses, key to understanding how developing immunity may prevent reinfection and limit
further spread in the population.
In England, there was a large and widespread outbreak in March and April 2020 leading to
high levels of hospitalisation and deaths.10 A national lockdown with the closure of schools,
universities, hospitality, all but essential retail, and advice to work from home and avoid nonessential travel, was introduced in late March with a marked reduction in new infections until
late August 2020.11
We have used a home-based testing approach to survey the extent of antibody positivity in
the population indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)
employed allows a snapshot of antibody prevalence. Our first national survey in England,
carried out among 105,000 individuals in late June 2020, found 6% of the adult population
had detectable antibodies. Since the LFIA has a threshold for detection of a positive result, a
decline in antibody level in individuals who have been infected may at some point result in

negative tests, that is when the antibody levels fall below the threshold. Thus the proportion
of positive tests in sequential random population samples can be used as an indicator of
antibody waning.
The time-concentrated nature of the first wave of the UK epidemic provides an opportunity
for measuring changes in antibody positivity in the population to estimate waning, and to
quantify how this varies by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We report here
prevalence of detectable antibody across three rounds of surveys (REACT-2 study12-14)
involving representative cross-sections of the population of England.
Methods
We analysed data from three rounds of a serial cross-sectional study of adults in England, UK
that were carried out between June and September 2020 (Table 1). The protocol has been
published;12 briefly, these were random, non-overlapping community samples from the adult
population 18 years and older, using a self-administered LFIA test at home.12–15 Invitations
were sent to named individuals randomly selected from the NHS patient list which includes
anyone registered with a General Practitioner in England and covers almost the entire
population. We aimed for a sample size of 100,000 in rounds 1 and 2 and 150,000 in round 3
to obtain prevalence estimates at lower tier local authority level. Sample size calculations are
provided in the protocol,12 and the number of invitations sent out was based on an assumed
response rate of 36 to 38% based on previous surveys. Registration was closed after 125,000
people signed up in rounds 1 and 2, and after 195,000 in round 3. Across all three rounds,
37.7% of those invited registered, and 29.9% provided a valid (IgG positive or negative)
result (Supplementary appendix table S1). The response rate declined slightly over the three
rounds. Those who registered were posted a self-administered point-of-care LFIA test
(Fortress Diagnostics, Northern Ireland) with written and video instructions. The sensitivity

of finger-prick blood (self-read) for IgG antibodies was 84.4% (70.5, 93.5) in RT-PCR
confirmed cases in healthcare workers, and specificity 98.6% (97.1, 99.4) in pre-pandemic
sera.16 Participants completed a short registration questionnaire (online/telephone) and a
further survey upon completion of their self-test. Survey instruments are available on the
study website (https://www.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/research-and-impact/groups/reactstudy/).
The prevalence from each round was calculated as the proportion of individuals reporting a
valid test result who had a positive IgG result, adjusted for test performance,17 and weighted
at national level for age, sex, region, ethnicity and deprivation to the adult population of
England (Supplementary Appendix section 1.2). Change in prevalence was calculated
between each round and from the first to the third round, and reported at national, regional
and local geographic area, plus by key sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.
Epidemic curves were constructed retrospectively from information from participants with a
positive antibody test who had reported the date of onset for a confirmed or possible case of
COVID-19.
To establish the sensitivity of the LFIA in relation to titres of neutralising antibodies we
performed live virus neutralization tests on 49 sera from health care workers at 21 days or
more since confirmed RT-PCR diagnosis of SARS CoV2 infection.16 Each of the sera was
tested in the laboratory with the Fortress LFIA. In addition, the ability of the sera to
neutralise wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed by neutralisation assay on Vero-E6
cells. Heat-inactivated sera were serially diluted in assay diluent consisting of DMEM
(Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 0.3% BSA fraction V (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two-fold serial dilutions
starting at 1:10 were incubated with 100 TCID50/well of SARS-CoV-2/England/IC19/2020

diluted in assay diluent for 1 hr at room temperature and transferred to 96-well plates preseeded with Vero-E6 cells. Serum dilutions were performed in duplicate. Plates were
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 days before staining the monolayers for surviving cells by
adding an equal volume of 2X crystal violet stain to wells for 1 hr. Plates were washed, wells
were scored for cytopathic effect and a neutralisation titre calculated as the reciprocal of the
highest serum dilution at which full virus neutralisation occurred.
Data were analysed using the statistical package R version 4.0.0.18
We obtained research ethics approval from the South Central-Berkshire B Research Ethics
Committee (IRAS ID: 283787), and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
approval for use of the LFIA for research purposes only. A REACT Public Advisory Group
provides input into the design and conduct of the research.

Results
Results were available for 99,908, 105,829 and 159,367 people over the three rounds, which
took place approximately 12, 18 and 24 weeks after the peak of the epidemic in England in
early April. There were 17,576 positive tests in total. National antibody prevalence, adjusted
for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England, declined from 6.0%
[5.8, 6.1], to 4.8% [4.7, 5.00] and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5], a fall of 26.3% [-29.0, -23.8] over the three
rounds. (Table 1, Figure 1) The fall was larger between rounds 1 and 2 (19.0% [-21.8, -16.1])
than between 2 and 3 (-9.1% [-12.0, -6.2]).
Over the three rounds of study we found similar patterns of infection to those reported in
round 11. Prevalence was highest for ages 18-24 years and lowest in those aged 75 and over.
In the latest round, prevalence remained highest in London, at 9.5% (9.0, 9.9) compared with

1.6% (1.3, 1.9) in the South West of England; people of Black (includes Black Caribbean,
African and Black British) and Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity had higher prevalence
(13.8% [12.6-15.1] and 9.7% [9.1-10.4]) respectively, than those of white ethnicity (3.6%
[3.5-3.8]). Prevalence was also higher among people working in health and social
(residential) care, those living in more deprived areas and larger households (Table 2).
Table 2 and Figure 2 show the change in prevalence by round and overall by key covariates.
There was a decline in prevalence between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups, with the smallest
overall decline at ages 18-24 years (-14.9% [-21.6, -8.1]) and largest at ages 75 years and
over (-39.0% [-50.8, -27.2]). The decline from rounds 1 to 3 was largest in those who did not
report a history of COVID-19, (-64.0% [-75.6, -52.3]), compared to -22.3% ([-27.0, -17.7]) in
those with COVID-19 confirmed on PCR. There was no change in prevalence between
rounds 1 and 3 in healthcare workers (+3.45% [-5.7, +12.7]).
Figure 3 shows how antibody prevalence changed between rounds at lower tier local area
level (see also maps in Supplementary Appendix Figure 1). The slope of the fitted line
approximates to the average decrease in prevalence, and the scatter shows the variation, with
some areas seeing an increase and others a large decrease between rounds.
The epidemic curves constructed from people who tested positive and reporting symptoms
for each of the three rounds closely overlap, illustrating the relatively short, concentrated
outbreak across the country with the majority of cases in March and April. (Figure 4) The
figure also shows a steep decline in new cases from 6 April, 2 weeks after the national
lockdown was introduced on 23 March. There was limited evidence of new cases after early
May overall, but some apparent ongoing transmission in health and social care workers into
May and June. (Figure 5). We noted a small increase in cases from late August and early
September at the start of the second wave.

To check for consistency between rounds we compared the sensitivity cut-off points between
the Fortress LFIA batches used in Round 1 and Rounds 2 and 3 using serial dilutions of sera
from 10 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and found a high level of
consistency (Supplementary appendix figure 2). In laboratory-based assays using sera from
health care workers who had recovered from SARS CoV2 infection, we found that a positive
result on the LFIA used in the REACT 2 antibody prevalence study was associated with a
higher titre of neutralising antibody. Sera that scored positive in the LFIA had a median
neutralization titre of 40 which was significantly (P<0.0001) higher than those that scored
negative with a median of zero (Figure 6).

Discussion
We observe a significant decline in the proportion of the population with detectable
antibodies over three rounds of national surveillance, using a self-administered lateral flow
test, 12, 18 and 24 weeks after the first peak of infections in England. This is consistent with
evidence that immunity to seasonal coronaviruses declines over 6 to 12 months after infection
and emerging data on SARS-CoV-2 that also detected a decrease over time in antibody levels
in individuals followed in longitudinal studies.4,5,9 We observed clear differences in rates of
decline between groups, for example those reporting SARS-CoV-2 infection based on PCR
versus those without a history of COVID-19. In some groups with continued exposure risks
no change in prevalence was seen (e.g. healthcare workers).
The relevance of antibody waning for the potential for reinfection by SARS CoV-2 is
currently not resolved.19,20 During any antibody response to an acute pathogen, some level of
antibody waning in the months following infection is expected as short lived plasma cells die.
Low levels of affinity-matured antibody usually continues to be produced by long-lived

plasma cells, and may be sufficient to maintain levels of antibody that confer immunity.
Indeed for some pathogens such as measles, influenza and rhinovirus, antibodies can be
detected for many years after infection. However the situation for coronaviruses is less clear.
Human challenge studies showed a more profound waning of serum and nasal antibody over
one year following coronavirus challenge than was seen for volunteers challenged with
rhinovirus. At one year, re-infection with the seasonal coronavirus was observed whereas
volunteers who retained antibodies following rhinovirus infection displayed sterilizing
immunity. 21,22
Moreover modelling shows that waning immunity can explain the 1-2 year periodicity of
reinfections with seasonal coronaviruses.23 Although reports of reinfection with SARS-CoV2
have been limited to date,24 this is in part because definitive evidence of reinfection requires
sequencing of virus at two time points, which is rarely available in practice. In addition,
asymptomatic testing is not yet widespread in many countries and thus mild or asymptomatic
reinfections will go undetected. Understanding the ongoing risks of reinfection for the
population is key to understanding the future course of the epidemic.
It is widely thought that titres of anti-Spike (S) antibodies which target the receptor binding
domain (RBD, associated with cell entry) correlate with protection from reinfection. 25,26The
lateral flow test used for this study detects antibodies against the spike protein (anti-S), but is
qualitative rather than quantitative, and the threshold of detection is not stated in
manufacturer’s instructions. We tested serial dilutions of known positive sera in the LFIA
and confirmed that for each of the sera there was a different dilution after which the LFIA no
longer yielded a positive band (Supplementary Appendix Figure 2). This demonstrates that,
as antibody wanes from a population with a diverse mixture of starting titres, gradually the
proportion of positive individual tests will decline. Our data in Figure 6 suggest the threshold

for detection of antibody in sera with the LFIA corresponds to serum endpoint titres that
score between 1:10 and 1:40 in a live virus microneutralisation assay. We cannot know at this
time how this relates to the level of antibody that confers protection from infection, though
studies in non-human primates vaccinated with an array of vaccines that conferred varying
levels of immunity, suggest these may be similar levels to those required for protection.27 The
relevant thresholds for protection in humans who are naturally exposed to virus remain to be
defined and will continue to be informed by detailed studies of outbreaks.28 In addition it is
currently not clear what contribution T cell immunity and memory responses will play in
protective immunity during re-exposure. As such, it is not possible to say with certainty that
the loss of antibody positivity in the LFIA would correlate with an increased risk of an
individual being reinfected. However, at a population level, the waning we have observed
may indicate an overall decline in the level of population immunity.
The declining prevalence of antibodies raises the question as to the extent to which antibody
prevalence estimated during round one of our study, approximately 3 months after the peak
of the first wave, may have underestimated the total of those infected in the first wave in the
UK. We reported a prevalence of 6.0% (95% CI: 5.8-6.1) from round one (20 June to 13 July
2020), implying that at least 3.36 (3.22, 3.51) million adults in England had been infected
with SARS-CoV-2 and tested positive for antibodies.13 Descriptions of the decline following
infection are variable, with a general consensus that IgG levels can remain high for 2-3
months before declining,9,29 but those with smaller initial antibody responses are likely to
decline earlier.9 Decline may initially be rapid, before plateauing, but data on this are only
now beginning to emerge. Our previous estimate of antibody prevalence was consistent with
that from the smaller ONS survey which reports antibody prevalence declining from 7.4%
(95% CI 5.6, 9.6) in May to 5.6% (5.0, 6.2) in September.30

Our study has limitations. It included non-overlapping random samples of the population, but
it is possible that people who had been exposed to the virus were less likely to take part over
time, which may have contributed to apparent population antibody waning. However, we had
similar response rates across the three surveys, and for each round, we re-weighted the
sample to be representative of the country as a whole. We adjusted for test characteristics
(sensitivity, specificity) based on our evaluation in clinic-based tests among healthcare
workers with confirmed infection, carried out before the first round,16 but changes in
prevalence are unlikely to be a consequence of batch variation in tests. We compared the
laboratory performance of the LFIAs used in rounds 1 and 2 (where we had seen the
strongest decline in positive tests) and found no difference between the two rounds. We also
did not detect differences in ability of participants to use the LFIA (indeed, failure rates were
lower in later rounds compared to earlier ones). The characteristics of the test mean that
results are not appropriate for clinical use in individuals and participants are advised not to
change their behaviour based on the result. However, as participants are not blind to the
results of their LFIA it is possible that this may have introduced bias into their questionnaire
response, but this should not have affected our observation of declining prevalence over time.
In summary, our findings provide evidence of variable waning in antibody positivity over
time based on detectable IgG antibodies using a lateral flow assay. These data suggest the
possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of reinfection as detectable
antibodies decline in the population.

Figure 1: Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in England, by round of study (95%
confidence intervals) for full cohort and by sex

Legend: Dates: Round 1 (June 20 – July 13 2020), Round 2 (31 July – 13 August 2020), Round 3 (15 - 28

September). Points show antibody prevalence by round of study. Prevalences are shown for the full sample
(grey line), for male respondents only (red line) and for female respondents only (blue line). Error bars indicate
95% confidence intervals. Data points are aligned with the median response date within each round. All
estimates of prevalence (95% confidence intervals) adjusted for imperfect test sensitivity and specificity, and
re-weighted to account for sample design and for variation in response rate (age, sex, ethnicity, region and
deprivation) to be representative of the England population (18+)

for known test performance and re-weighted where appropriate to be representative of the 18+ population of England (** denotes weighted prevalence). Survey
responses were received across 2–3 week periods in each round (in late June, early August and mid-September); data points are aligned with the median response
date within each round

Regression:

R2 vs R1 = 0.620, 38% reduction
R3 vs R2 = 0.846, 15% reduction
R3 vs R1 = 0.594, 41% reduction

Legend: Scatterplot for each lower tier local authority showing change in prevalence from round 1 to round 2
(left) and round 2 to round 3 (right). The dashed line represents no change, the blue line the linear regression.
The slope of the fitted line indicates the average decrease in prevalence, and the scatter shows the variation,
with some areas seeing an increase and others a very large decrease between rounds.
