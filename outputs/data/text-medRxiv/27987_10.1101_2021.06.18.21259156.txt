Abstract
Background
Several studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in schools, with a wide range of secondary
attack rate (SAR; range: 0-100%). We aimed to examine the key risk factors to better
understand transmission in school settings.
Methods
We collected records of SARS-CoV-2 school outbreaks globally published from January 2020 to
January 2021 and compiled information on hypothesized risk factors. We utilized the directed
acyclic graph (DAG) to conceptualize the risk mechanisms, used logistic regression to examine
each risk-factor group, and further built multiple variable models based on the marginal
analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
Results
From 17 relevant articles, 26 school clusters were included for analysis. The best-fit model
showed that the intensity of community transmission (aOR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22 - 1.30, for each
increase of 10 cases per 100,000 persons per week), social distancing (aOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18 0.37), mask-wearing (aOR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.78) were associated the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection in schools. Compared to students in pre-schools, the aOR was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07 0.19) for students in primary schools and 1.31 (95% CI: 0.93 - 1.87) for students in high schools.
Conclusions
Preventive measures in both schools (e.g. social distancing and mask-wearing) and communities
(additionally, vaccination) should be taken to collectively reduce transmission and protect
children in schools. Flexible reopening policies may be considered for different levels of schools
given their risk differences.

Key messages
• We collected published records of COVID-19 school outbreaks globally to investigate the
considerable heterogeneity in secondary attack rates (SAR) reported from school
outbreaks and compiled information regarding potential risk factors.
• Higher community death and case rates are associated with higher SARs in children in
school settings.
• Mask-wearing and social distancing are associated with lower SARs.
• When compared to pre-schools and early childhood education centers, primary schools
have lower rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 however high schools have higher rates.

Introduction
Since the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised about the impact
of schools on community transmission and the well-being of students and staff, as well as the
impact on the schedules of healthcare workers concerning childcare [1]. Out of an abundance
of caution and fear that the SARS-CoV-2 virus would spread rapidly in schools much like
influenza pandemics [2], countries globally decided to suspend in-person classes and begin
online instruction. By April 2020, over 1.5 million students worldwide were affected by school
closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [3]. In contrast to influenza pandemics where
children are the key drivers of transmission, studies have indicated that children are likely less
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, tend to experience less severe disease when infected, and
likely have lower transmissibility [4, 5]. Given this new evidence, schools in many places have
gradually reopened since the summer of 2020, while implementing varying level of preventive
measures (e.g., mask wearing, distancing, limiting the number of students, rotating schedules,
and viral testing) to reduce risk of transmission. Given these circumstances, the risk of SARSCoV-2 outbreaks in school settings may differ substantially across space and time. Indeed,
several studies have examined school outbreaks of COVID-19 and reported secondary attack
rates (SAR) – i.e., the proportion of infected contacts of an index case out of all contacts of that
index case [6] – ranging from 0 (i.e., no secondary infections) to 100% (i.e., infections among all
contacts). However, this discrepancy is still not fully understood and a better understanding
can inform better preventive measures for future outbreaks not limited to COVID-19 or school
settings.
To identify the main factors that determine the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and
inform strategies to prevent future school outbreaks, here we examined the associations
between SARS-CoV-2 SAR in children and various potential risk factors. We compiled data from
relevant studies in the literature reporting SARS-CoV-2 SAR in schools and for posited risk
factors (e.g. incidence in the community) and further used regression models to examine key

risk factors of having high SAR in schools. We found that appropriate distancing and mask
wearing, school levels, and the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community are
key determinants of SAR in school settings.
Methods
Data sources
Studies were searched for on the “Living Evidence for COVID-19” database [24], which retrieves
articles from EMBASE via Ovid, PubMed, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv. Any article within this database
was considered, from December 2019 up to February 17, 2021. The search terms used include
“transmission AND (school OR schools)” or “transmission AND children.” When titles and
abstracts were identified as being potentially relevant, the articles were read to determine if
the outbreaks took place in a school setting and the number of infections and contacts were
reported. In addition, we extracted 11 observations included in a systematic review of evidence
regarding the ability of children to transmit SARS-CoV-2 in schools [7]. In total, 17 studies were
included in this analysis (see Appendix 1).
Relevant data, as deemed by an initial conceptual analysis using the directed acyclic graph
(DAG; see details below), were taken from the articles identified above. These included the
time period of the study, study design, location, season, age of children, whether the study
happened during a lockdown, type of school according to the International Standard
Classification of Education [8], reported SARs, number of contacts of the index case, testing
method (PCR vs. serology), level of surveillance (all contacts, some contacts, only symptomatic),
and whether masks and social distancing were required. In addition, we compiled additional
data for potential risk or confounding factors of SARS- CoV-2 transmission in schools for each
identified study as detailed in the next section.
Conceptual analysis and variable coding
The unit of analysis was individual study and in cases where several school types were covered
in one study the data were stratified by those school types. We first conducted a conceptual
analysis using the DAG and identified eight key components that may affect SARS-CoV-2
transmission in schools (Fig 1). Below we describe each of the eight components, rationale for
inclusion, and related variables examined.
1) School types, based on studies indicating differential transmission risk among different age
groups [20, 22]. Here, we examined this factor as a categorical variable including 4 levels, i.e.
pre-school or early childhood education center (ECEC), primary school, high school, and mixedlevel school. The first three levels were per reports in the included school studies. For studies
that examined several types of school but did not report school type specific SARs, we assigned

them to a “mixed-level school” category. For example, if a study gave the overall SAR combining
a pre-school and a primary school it was given the value “mixed-level school.”
SARS-CoV-2 SAR among children in school settings is the number of infected contacts divided by
the total number of contacts at each school.
2) Physical school settings such as student density in the classroom and ventilation systems that
may affect the intensity of school contact and clearance of air. As it is difficult to obtain
information related to ventilation settings, here we included class size in our analysis based on
the average number of students per classroom in each country, as reported by the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [12].
3) Cultural climates, which “represent independent preferences for one state of affairs over
another that distinguish countries (rather than individuals) from each other” [9] and may reflect
the collective risk tendency of a population. The Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory [9]
included 6 related measures including individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, long
term orientation, and indulgence. In particular, individualism is defined as the degree of
interdependence of society maintains among its members. We reasoned that the individualism
measure would be most relevant to the level of compliancy to public health interventions and
in turn the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Thus, here we included individualism in our analysis
and dichotomized the reported values for each country into high (≥ 50) or low.
4) Preventive measures, which may reduce outbreak risk. Here we included both mask-wearing
and social distancing. For these variables, we dichotomized based on as the use of face masks
(or social distancing) by either students, staff, or both. For instance, for mask-wearing, if either
group (students or staff) were required to wear face masks onsite, the school would receive a
value of 1 and 0 otherwise.
5) Surveillance and/or testing policies implemented in schools. On the one hand, testing policies
could affect the reported values of SAR; for instance, testing of all contacts regardless of
symptoms may lead to identification of more infections including those asymptomatic and
increase the numerator of SAR. On the other, frequent testing of all if combined with school
closure may serve as a containment measure to reduce the risk of onward transmission and in
turn reduce SAR. Here we thus included the reported testing practices for contacts in the
school outbreak clusters as a categorical ordinal variable. Three types of testing were reported
in the school studies, including testing only the symptomatic, both symptomatic and some
asymptomatic, and all contacts. However, due to the small sample size in “only symptomatic”
(n = 3), we dichotomized surveillance to testing “only symptomatic or some asymptomatic” and
“all contacts” of an index case in each school cluster.

6) Community transmission intensity, which may increase the introduction of infections into
school settings. To examine its impact, we included two measures, i.e., the weekly case rate per
100,000 for the study area for the study period and weekly death rate per 100,000 from COVID19; both measures were computed using data from the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource
Center [10] and standardized by overall country population. See “Sensitivity analysis” below for
justification of these choices.
7) Seasonal changes such as humidity and temperature, which may affect the survival and
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we used specific humidity (a measure of absolute humidity)
to examine the potential impact from disease seasonality, as specific humidity and temperature
are highly correlated. Specifically, ground surface temperature and relative humidity for each
study location were extracted from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using
the “stationaRy” package [11]. Daily mean specific humidity in g H20/kg air was then computed
based on the temperature and relative humidity data and was averaged over the study period.
8) Indicators of socioeconomic status such as national income that reflect a country’s ability to
mobilize resources to fight COVID-19. As such, we included measured national income for each
study in our analysis; specifically, national income is measured as the gross domestic product
(GDP) subtracting capital depreciation and adding net foreign income, using data from the
World Inequality Database [13].
Statistical Analyses
Marginal analysis.
Due to the low number of observations (n = 26 schools), we conducted an initial analysis to test
combinations of the DAG covariates described above. The goal was to examine the relationship
between SAR and only one group of variables at a time and then include the most relevant
predictors into the final model based on this analysis. For each test, we used a logistic
regression model of the following form:
l𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑆𝐴𝑅) ∼ 𝑋

Multi-risk factor analysis
All five variable groups were found to be associated with SAR in the marginal analysis (see
Results). We thus tested models including different combinations of these variables. For all
models, we included surveillance type to account for potential biases in reporting including
missing asymptomatic infections, which would underestimate SAR. We also assessed for
confounding between our variables of interest and SARS-CoV-2 SAR (see adjustments specified
above). This procedure began with including all of the significant variables from the marginal
analysis and removing one at a time to see the effect of its removal on model fit. We then
evaluated and selected the most parsimonious model with the best fit based on the Akaike
information criterion (AIC; Table S1). The best performing model took the following form:
l𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡(𝑆𝐴𝑅) ∼ mask-wearing + social distancing + weekly case rate + school type + surveillance
All statistical analyses were performed in RStudio, a user interface for R (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All models were fitted using the “glm” function from the
built-in “stats” library in R.
Sensitivity analysis
We tested different measures of community transmission, to examine the robustness of our
models to potential biases due to variations in case-ascertainment, mortality risk, and delay in
event occurrence (e.g. from infection to death) and reporting. Specifically, we additionally
examined two mortality-related measures in representing the intensity of community
transmission: 1) weekly death rate for the study period and 2) weekly death rate for the study
period plus one month. The additional month added accounts for the time lag that occurs as
death from COVID-19 may take several weeks [14]. Risk factors identified using these two
measures were similar to those in our main analysis (Table S2). As the risk of death due to
COVID-19 reduced substantially over time [15], likely due to improved medical treatment and
management, such a change may bias the death rates recorded over time for the included
studies spanning the initial phase in March 2020 to a later phase in Dec 2020. For this reason,
we used weekly case rate per 100,000 to represent the intensity of community transmission in
our main analysis.
Results
Summary statistics
We identified 26 reported SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in schools, totaling 630 secondary cases in
children among 8322 contacts. These outbreaks occurred in 12 countries, spanning 4 WHO
regions including the Americas, Western Pacific, European, and Eastern Mediterranean Region.

Table 1 shows the frequencies and summary statistics for SARS-CoV-2 SAR and other variables
included. SARS-CoV-2 SAR and weekly cases per 100,000 population were both right skewed.
While the reported SAR ranged from 0 to 100%, the majority of schools reported very low SAR
(median: 0.7%, interquartile range: 0 – 17%). The majority of school settings included in these
studies required mask-wearing (19/26, or 73%) and distancing (14/26, or 54%). Around half of
the studies tested all contacts of the index case (12/26, or 46%). The studies covered roughly
even proportion for different school types: 5 (19%) were pre-schools, 9 (35%) were primary
schools, 7 (27%) were high schools, and 5 (19%) were mixed schools.
Marginal analysis
The marginal analysis (Figure 2), adjusting for surveillance, indicated that, for the intensity of
community transmission, each 10-unit increase in weekly case rate was associated with an
increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in schools [odds ratio (OR): 1.11; 95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.08 - 1.14]; and each 10-unit increase in weekly death rate was associated with an
increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in schools (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.40 - 1.54). For
preventive measures, social distancing (OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.29) was associated with a
lower SAR in schools. For school type, compared to pre-schools, being in primary schools (OR:
0.69, 95% CI: 0.49 - 0.98) or mixed schools (OR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49 - 0.98) was associated with a
lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection whereas being in high schools (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.44 - 2.69)
was associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the school physical setting
measure, each 1-person increase in the national average class size was associated with an
increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in schools (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.21 - 1.30). For disease
seasonality, each 1 g H20/kg increase in specific humidity was associated with a decreased risk
of contracting SARS-CoV-2 in schools (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.92). Estimates were similar
when the model did not adjust for surveillance (Figure 2).
Multi-risk factor analysis
Among all models tested (Table S1), the best-performing model with the lowest AIC included
three key groups of risk factors, namely, intensity of community transmission, preventive
measures, and school type, adjusting for surveillance. Overall, these risk factors in combination
were able to explain 57.7% of the variance in the reported SARS-CoV-2 SAR (McFadden’s
pseudo R2 = 0.577; Fig 3) [21, 23]. Fig 4 and Table 2 show the estimated adjusted ORs (aORs)
for each risk factor.

The multi-risk factor model showed that every 10-unit increase in COVID-19 cases rate in the
community was associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools (aOR: 1.26;
95% CI: 1.22 - 1.30). Conversely, both social distancing (aOR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.37) and

mask-wearing (aOR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.78) were associated a decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection in schools. Compared to students in pre-schools, the aOR was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.07, 0.19)
for students in primary schools, 1.31 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.87) for students in high schools, and 0.26
(95% CI: 0.18, 0.39) for students in mixed schools.
Discussion
Leveraging available data on multiple reported SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in schools and potential
risk factors, we have examined main factors associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2
transmission in schools. Our analyses suggest that the most significant predictors of SARS-CoV2 SAR in schools are the level of community transmission (measured as weekly COVID-19 case
rate) and preventative measures, once adjusted for surveillance and school type.
The model identified community transmission as the most significant variable associated with
the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools. In particular, the multi-risk factor model
estimated that, in a community of 100,000 persons, every 10 additional cases per week in the
community increases the odds of infection in schools by 26%. This finding highlights the
potential community-to-school importation of cases and subsequent risk of outbreak in schools.
As such, care must be applied when reopening or operating schools in areas with high levels of
community transmission. In addition, reversing some original fears about school-to-community
SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is likely that the community transmission drives outbreaks in
school, not the reverse. Further, with the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, predominantly to
adults at present, it is paramount that all eligible adults get vaccinated promptly to lower the
risk of transmission in the community and in turn to provide indirect protection to children via
the increased population immunity.
Our model suggests that distancing policies have the greatest impact on reducing transmission
in schools (aOR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 - 0.37). This finding is likely a combined outcome of reduced
number of contacts and reduced short-range transmission when social distancing policies were
followed. Maintaining distance has necessitated fewer people in a room at the same time,
leading to fewer contacts. In addition, the increased personal space in classroom enables
students to avoid the likely higher viral concentration within short-range of the emitter (either
via aerosols, droplets, or in combination) when far apart.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that social distancing measures may be more diﬀicult to
achieve fully in disadvantaged communities with underfunded and overcrowded schools,
further exacerbating the COVID-19 crises in these communities, usually of color [16, 17].
Furthermore, racially motivated structural factors prevent these disadvantaged communities
from practicing social distancing policies outside of the school. For example, these communities

tend to make up most of essential workers and thus have higher rates of transmission in their
community [19], increasing potential introduction of infections into schools.
Another preventive measure, mask-wearing, was also found to be significantly protective
against SARS-CoV-2 infection in schools. While the association was not as substantial as for
social distancing, a reduction by half (aOR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.35 - 0.78) is still considerable. In
addition to mitigating the risk of infection, this protective association may also come from
masks reducing the emission of viral particles of SARS-CoV-2 infected wearers [18]. This latter
means of protection is particularly important in settings like schools, as infections in children
are more likely to be asymptomatic or mild and thus more difficult to identify [23].
Nevertheless, concerns have been raised regarding the potential developmental and health
harms of masks on very young children. Given this trade-off, more effective use of other
preventive measures such as vaccination of all those eligible especially care takers, improved
ventilation, and physical distancing may serve to reduce the need for long-term use of masks
among very young children for their protection.
In comparison to pre-schools, students in both primary and mixed-level schools had a lower risk
of SARS-CoV-2 infection whereas those in high schools had a higher risk. This finding is
consistent with previous studies indicating the likely lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection and transmissibility among young children [23]. In addition, it is also likely in part due
to the greater ability of older children to follow directions regarding preventive measures but
with less compliance among high school students. The similarity of the estimates between
primary school and mixed-level schools is likely due to the number of primary schools that were
folded into the mixed-level school category – three of the five schools that made up this group
included primary schools. Overall, these findings support flexible reopening policies for
different levels of schools given the risk differences.
When schools test all contacts of the index case, this effectively functions as a control measure
in that more cases will be detected and is more likely to result in a school closure. This may
explain why the OR estimate for all contacts surveillance is protective, as the outbreak was
identified and able to be contained before the asymptomatic individuals were able to infect
others.
This study has several limitations. First, the analyses included a limited number of studies (n =
26), due to the inclusion criteria and the dearth of published reports on this topic to date.
Future research with additional relevant studies may enhance the statistical power of inference
for the risk factors examined here. Second, due to a lack of detailed information for each
specific school setting, we used proxy measures in the analyses (e.g., class size at the national

level was used rather than for each reporting school), which may have limited the ability of the
models to identify the association of these factors with SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Similarly,
due to the lack of data, we were not able to examine other key factors such as ventilation in
classrooms, social economic status of individual students and their households, and potential
differences in susceptibility and transmissibility by age group. Future work with comprehensive
study designs and data collection is warranted to provide further insights into how infections,
not limited to SARS-CoV-2, spread in schools and the broad, bi-directional impact of school and
community transmission. This would be invariable to inform better strategies to combat future
infectious disease outbreaks.

Supplemental Tables
Table S1. Performance of different models. In the marginal analysis, 5 models for 5 groups of
risk factors are tested. In the multi-risk factor analysis, 11 models with all possible combinations
of 4 groups of risk factors are tested (i.e., excluding models with only one group tested in the
marginal analysis). All models adjusted for surveillance. Note that although class size was
identified as a significant risk factor in the marginal analysis, further including this variable in
the multi-risk models gave impossible values for parameter estimates; we therefore excluded
class size in the multi-risk model analysis. The best-performing model with the lowest AIC is
bolded.
