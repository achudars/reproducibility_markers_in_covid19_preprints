Abstract
Background
The extent and character of lung involvement on chest computerized tomography (CT) have a
prognostic value in covid-19 but there is lack of consensus on how to assess and stage CT features.
A scoring system of lung involvement in covid-19, Örebro covid-19 Scale (ÖCoS) was
implemented in clinical routine on April 1 2020 in Örebro Region, Sweden. The ÖCoS-severity
score measures the extent of lung involvement while ÖCoS-temporal stage characterizes the
parenchymal involvement. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ÖCoS scores in
relation to clinical outcome of covid-19.
Methods
Population based study including data from all hospitalized patients with covid-19 in Örebro
Region during March to July 2020. Chest CT scores at the time of hospital admission and ICU
admission were analyzed in relation to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, time to
ICU admission and admission to ICU or death.
Findings
In the 381 included patients, there was a close correlation of the ÖCoS-severity score on admittance
to hospital and the hospital length of stay. The ÖCoS-severity score on hospital admittance was a
strong predictor for both a severe outcome in regards to ICU admittance or death and the time to
ICU admittance. On admittance to ICU, both ÖCoS-severity score and temporal stage were
correlated with the ICU length of stay.
Interpretation
Chest CT visual scoring on admission to hospital predicts the clinical course in covid-19
pneumonia.
Funding
This work was supported by the Örebro Region, Sweden.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic that represents an important threat to human
health. Up to September 28, 2020, more than one million people have died from covid-19 in over
160 countries1. Although most covid-19 patients present with mild illness, a minority of patients
have a severe outcome characterized by pneumonia, respiratory failure and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS)2. The strongest independent risk factor for a severe outcome is high
age3. Other important risk factors include male sex, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes with
complications3,4. Within certain populations up to 30% of infected patients may require
hospitalization and increased medical support5. Outbreaks of covid-19 are causing a considerable
strain on the health system with a shortage of hospital and intensive care units (ICU) beds6. To
manage the potentially critical burden on the health care system during outbreaks and to triage
individual patients, there is a clinical need for robust prognostic models to predict the course of
covid-19.
Previous research have demonstrated a prognostic role of the extent and character of lung
involvement on chest computerized tomography (CT) in covid-197-9. These studies have applied an
abundance of different methods to measure covid-19 lung involvement and consequently there is no
consensus in the literature on how to assess and stage CT features of covid-19. In addition,
published predictive models have generally been developed using retrospectively interpreted CT
images by expert thoracic radiologists in contrast to clinical routine were chest CTs typically are
read by general radiologists.
In response to an increased demand for chest CTs in covid-19, a concise scoring system of lung
involvement in covid-19, the Örebro covid-19 Scale (ÖCoS) was implemented in clinical routine on
April 1 2020 at the Department of Radiology, Örebro Region, Sweden. The intention was to provide
a standardized assessment of covid-19 pneumonia. Both the extent of lung involvement, ÖCoSseverity score, and the character of involvement, ÖCoS-temporal stage, are assessed on the scale.
The current study is a population-based evaluation of the clinically provided ÖCoS chest CT scores,
including all patients hospitalized for covid-19 in the Örebro Region during the first five months,
March-July 2020, of the covid-19 outbreak in Sweden. The primary aim was to evaluate chest CT at
hospital admission as a predictor of hospital length of stay (LoS) and admission to ICU or mortality.
The secondary aim was to evaluate chest CT at ICU admission in relation to ICU LoS.

Material and Methods
Ethics
The Swedish Ethical Review Authority approved the study protocol and waived the informed
consent requirement for this retrospective study, reference number 2020-02515.
Study population
The study included all patients ≥18 years admitted as in-patients due to laboratory confirmed covid19 in one of the three hospitals, one university hospital and two associated hospitals, in Örebro
Region, Sweden. Covid-19 patients were identified through the ICD-codes corresponding to either a
primary laboratory confirmed diagnosis of covid-19, or a primary diagnosis of covid-19 based on a
typical clinical picture in combination with a positive antibody test for covid-19, or a laboratory
confirmed secondary diagnosis of covid-19 with a non-etiological pulmonary diagnosis as a primary
diagnosis.
Data source
Data regarding age, sex, hospitalization times, hospitalization routes, ICU admission, death during
and after hospitalization, laboratory tests for covid-19, and radiology reports were extracted from
the information system and radiological information system of the Örebro Region. Data from March
1 to August 31, 2020 were extracted, but only patients admitted to hospital before July 4 were
included to enable at least 60 days observation time in the extracted data. Patients arriving from
hospitals external from the Örebro Region were excluded. Figure 1 describes the inclusion process
in detail.
Chest CT
Visual scoring – Örebro Covid-19 Scale (ÖCoS)
The structured ÖCoS chest CT report was introduced on April 1, 2020. The scale consists of the
disease severity score (ÖCoS-severity score) and temporal stage (ÖCoS-temporal stage) on discrete
scales, Figure 2. The ÖCoS-severity score is a visual assessment of the global lung involvement on
a six-point scale (0%, <10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, >75%) whereas the ÖCoS-temporal score
is a five-point ordinal scale assessing the parenchymal characteristics based on the transition from
normal parenchyma, via ground glass opacities (GGO) to consolidations as described in early
reports of the covid-19 disease evolution10. Radiologists were instructed to provide only one
selection for temporal stage and one selection for severity score for each examination. Scores were
provided similarly regardless of whether covid-19 was confirmed or not confirmed at the time of
reading. Figure 3 gives examples of ÖCoS scores.
In the study, the ÖCoS scores were extracted from the clinical radiology reports. Approximately 30
different radiologists and residents provided clinical scores that were extracted for the study. In
cases where no clinical ÖCoS scores were provided, mostly because of nighttime overseas
teleradiological reading and CT preformed before April 1, a separate ÖCoS reading for the study
was performed by a radiology resident (MW) blinded to all clinical information.

CT timing
The CT at hospital admission (CTadm) was defined as the chest CT closest in time to hospital
admission, with no longer than two days difference. The CT at ICU transfer (CT ICU) was defined as
the chest CT closest in time to ICU transfer, with no longer than two days difference.
Nucleic acid amplification and antibody tests
For detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were analyzed by different
methods during the study period. The vast majority of samples were analyzed by an in-house realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the E gene (with an RdRp
gene assay as confirmation) adapted from the protocol recommended by WHO, or the RdRp gene
assay alone. For antibody testing, the Diasorin (Saluggia, Italy) Liaison XL test for SARS-CoV-2
IgG was used, in combination with Euroimmun (Lübeck, Germany) SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA for
confirmation in weakly positive samples to increase specificity.

Outcome measures
Hospital length of stay
To summarize the effect of covid-19 on hospitalization time in the presence of the competing event
of death, we used the composite measure hospital free days 60 days post-admission (HFD60). For
each patient, the total number of HFD60, including readmissions, during the 60 days following the
first admission to hospital with covid-19 was computed. The hospital length of stay (LoS) was
defined as 60-HFD60. This outcome equals the hospitalization time within 60 days in non-deceased
patients whereas deceased patients and patients with a hospitalization time over 60 days will have a
hospital LoS of 60.
Combined ICU admission and mortality rate
The combined risk for ICU admission or death within 60 days was used as outcome measure in a
multivariate logistic regression.
Time to ICU admission
The intervals in days between CTadm and ICU admission were derived for all patients admitted to an
ICU.
ICU length of stay
For patients admitted to an ICU, the 60-day ICU free time (IFD60) following the day of ICU transfer
was computed. The ICU LoS used in the analysis was 60-IFD60, which corresponds to the total
ICU-time within 60 days in non-deceased patients.
Statistics
Matlab R2020a (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA) was used for statistics.
Multivariate linear regression with 60-HFD60 as dependent variable was performed to identify the
predictors for LoS. Age was treated as a continuous variable whereas ÖCoS temporal stage, ÖCoS
severity score and sex were treated as categorical variables. A reduced model was developed, where
the temporal stage A, B and C were grouped, forming the temporal stages: N (No lung
involvement), ABC (GGO extent greater than or equal consolidation extent), and D (Predominantly

Twenty-fold cross validation was performed to assess overfitting on the reduced linear regression
model with LoS as dependent variable.
For the analysis of time to ICU admission, Spearman correlation coefficient was computed for
CTadm ÖCoS-severity score, CTadm ÖCoS-temporal stage and age, and Wilcoxon signed rank test
was used to assess dependency of patient sex.
For the analysis of ICU length of stay, Spearman correlation coefficient was used to assess
dependency of CTICU ÖCoS-severity score, CTICU ÖCoS-temporal stage and age, and Wilcoxon
signed rank test was used to assess dependency of patient sex.

Results
Patient characteristics
In 375 out of 381 included patients, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was confirmed by RT-PCR and the
additional six patients were included on basis on a typical clinical picture supported by a positive
covid-19 antibody test. Patient characteristics and outcomes are described in Table 1.
Clinically provided ÖCoS scores were available in 309 out of 381 CTadm, and in 53 out of 67 CTICU.
During the retrospective inclusion period, in-patient covid-19 patients were treated with a standard
of care in line with international recommendations of that time11,12, including oxygen support and
low-molecular weight heparins.
Hospital length of stay
The hospital length of stay (LoS) in relation to CTadm ÖCoS-severity scores are shown for different
age groups in Figure 4. In patients ≤70 years old there was a close correlation between the ÖCoS
severity score and the LoS, while the ÖCoS-severity score was less clearly correlated to the LoS in
older patients.
The multivariate regression analysis identified patient sex, age and ÖCoS-severity score as
statistically significant predictor variables for LoS, Table 2. Since temporal stage A, B and C
demonstrated similar coefficients in the multivariate analysis, a reduced model was developed with
temporal stage A, B and C grouped. In the reduced model, the temporal stage was a statistically
significant predictor variable, and there was a consistent reduction in hospital LoS for temporal
stage D (predominantly consolidations) compared to earlier stages A-C (demonstrating more GGO)
and the first stage N (no lung involvement), Table 2.
The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the full model and the reduced model were similar, 17.2
days, indicating little loss of information in the reduction of predictors. Twenty-fold cross validation
of the reduced model linear regression showed a comparable RMSE, 17.6 days, indicating only
minor overfitting in the model.
The coefficients in the linear regression provides an interpretation of the impact of each variable in
terms of LoS days: the LoS increases with four days per ten years age difference and with four days
in males compared to females. A higher ÖCoS severity score is associated with longer LoS:
Compared to ÖCoS 0-1 (<10% extent), LoS in patients with CTadm demonstrating ÖCoS 2 (1025%) increased one day, ÖCoS 3 (25-50%) eleven days, ÖCoS 4 (50-75%) 20 days, and ÖCoS 5
(>75%) 30 days.
A more advanced ÖCoS-temporal stage, suggesting a later phase of covid-19 pneumonia at hospital
admission, was associated with a shorter LoS. Compared to ÖCoS N (no lung involvement), LoS in
patients with CTadm demonstrating ÖCoS A-C (GGO extent up to equal consolidation extent)
decreased seven days and ÖCoS D (predominantly consolidations) decreased ten days.

ICU admission and mortality rate
Figure 5 shows the combined ICU admission and death rate in relation to ÖCoS-severity score at
hospital admission. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, patient age was dichotomized as
over or under 70 years. The analysis identified the ÖCoS-severity score at hospital admission,
p<0.001, patient sex, p=0.006 and age, p=0.002 as significant predictor variables for the combined
outcome of ICU admission and mortality, Table 3.
Time to ICU transfer
The interval between the CTadm and ICU transfer was inversely related to the CTadm ÖCoS-severity
score, p=0.002, and CTadm ÖCoS-temporal stage p=0.051, but was not significantly associated with
age, p=0.15. There was no significant difference between male and female patients, p=0.39. The
interval between CTadm and ICU admission was longer for lower ÖCoS-severity scores and earlier
ÖCoS-temporal stages, Figure 6.
ICU Length of Stay
The relation of ÖCoS scores on CT at the time of ICU transfer (CTICU) and ICU outcomes are
shown in Figure 7. The ICU LoS was positively correlated to CTICU ÖCoS-severity score, p<0.001,
and inversely correlated to CTICU ÖCoS-temporal stage, p=0.044. The ICU LoS was correlated to
patient age p<0.001, but not to patient sex p=0.33.

Discussion
Covid-19 is an ongoing pandemic causing hospital crowding and shortage of ICU beds during
outbreaks. The disease has a variable prognosis and established validated scores such as CURB-65
have a low overall performance13,14. Instead, we demonstrate that clinically provided chest CT
visual scores at hospital admission can robustly predict the clinical course of covid-19 and that
chest CT at ICU admission can predict ICU time, especially in patients up to 70 years old.
The two aspects of the ÖCoS visual score – the temporal development of the CT pattern from GGO
to consolidations, and severity of lung involvement – are closely correlated to the patient outcomes
in the present study. In particular, we demonstrate that the ÖCoS-severity score, a visual estimation
of the extent of lung involvement, at hospital admission is a strong predictor of uneventful outcome
in terms of death or ICU admission and that it is an important predictor for hospital LoS. The
weaker association of these parameters in elderly patients, >70 years, may be due to frequent comorbidities in the elderly group creating a more complex relationship.
Although different chest CT findings have been described in covid-19, the typical features are GGO
and consolidations15. Three findings in the current study highlight that the transition from GGO to
consolidation on the ÖCoS-temporal stage reflects the clinical course in the acute phase of covid19, and often coincides with a deterioration of respiratory symptoms: 1) The inverse relationship of
ÖCoS-temporal stage and time to ICU transfer, Figure 6, 2) the inverse relationship of ÖCoStemporal stage at CTICU and ICU LoS, Figure 7 and 3) the lower number of hospital LoS days in
late ÖCoS-temporal stages on CTadm, Table 2.
To put the current study in context, we performed a systematic literature search, Supplementary
material. In summary, we found several reports on protocols of visual quantitative analysis of CT
evaluated lung involvement demonstrating a correlation to the clinical severity of covid-199,16. In
addition, several semi-automatized8,13,17 and computerized7,18,19 quantitative measures of covid-19
lung involvement on CT have been described to be associated with outcomes related to a severe
course of covid-19. However, to the best of our knowledge, up to date only one smaller study,
published as a letter to the editor, reported real-life data on the predictive role of CT visual scoring
in clinical routine20.
In this study, we report that the predictive role of chest CT can be reproduced in a non-selected
population-based context with CT evaluations made by several reviewers as part of clinical routine.
Since almost 80% of the study cohort underwent chest CT on admission there was probably only a
limited degree of selection of patients referred for CT. We used a concise visual scoring system as a
predictive model for outcome of hospitalized covid-19 patients. A strength is that the model apart
from patient age and sex rely solely on CT findings, excluding clinical and laboratory data. The
results indicate that triage with chest CT on admittance to hospital is a valuable tool for covid-19
patients, provided that a consistent scoring system is applied. The simplicity of the chest CT ÖCoS
scoring enables a straightforward implementation in clinical practice, supported by its rapid
acceptance among reading radiologists and referring clinicians in the Örebro Region, Sweden.
Moreover, a strength of this study is that we could, in contrast to other studies, provide outcomedata up 60 days post-admission including mortality after hospital discharge.

The study has several limitations. Consistent with the inclusion criteria, the results only apply to inpatients. The use of clinically provided scores by multiple readers is a limitation, but also a strength
in the study. Visual scoring is subjective and prone to interobserver variation, which reduces the
precision of the provided scores. On the other hand, the scores used in the study are a reasonable
estimate of the precision in a clinical scenario. Since the ÖCoS scores were provided in clinical
routine, the reviewers were not formally blinded, but the main study outcomes of HFD60 and ICU
admittance were naturally unknown to reviewers by the time of chest CT evaluation. Furthermore,
we only included laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19, and consequently a few covid-19 cases
are likely to have been excluded from the analysis21.
In conclusion, concise visual scoring of chest CT at hospital admission and at ICU transfer in
clinical routine predicts the clinical outcome of covid-19, especially in patients <70 years. In
situations where adjuvant treatments and hospital beds are limited, we believe that scoring of chest
CT is informative and a valuable tool for clinical decision making.

Supplementary material
A systemic literature search was performed on September 24th 2020 and 860 articles were retrieved from the Medline
database via Pubmed using the search string (covid OR sars-cov-2) AND (CT OR "computed tomography" OR CAT OR
"computer assisted tomography" OR "computerized tomography" OR "computerized tomography") AND (prognos* OR
predict* OR outcome). All titles were scanned for potential relevance and among the selected articles, abstracts were
reviewed. Ultimately, the search resulted in 54 articles that were considered to address the question of interest, namely
how chest CT images are associated with disease severity or outcome in patients with covid-19. A selection of relevant
articles are referred to in the main text.
