Abstract
Objectives: A plethora of medicines have been repurposed or used as adjunctive
therapies for COVID-19. We characterized the utilization of medicines as prescribed in
routine practice amongst patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in South Korea, China,
Spain, and the USA.
Design: International network cohort
Setting: Hospital electronic health records from Columbia University Irving Medical
Centre (NYC, USA), Stanford (CA, USA), Tufts (MA, USA), Premier (USA), Optum
EHR (USA), department of veterans affairs (USA), NFHCRD (Honghu, China) and
HM Hospitals (Spain); and nationwide claims from HIRA (South Korea)
Participants: patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from January to June 2020
Main outcome measures: Prescription/dispensation of any medicine on or 30 days
after hospital admission date
Analyses: Number and percentage of users overall and over time
Results: 71,921 people were included: 304 from China, 2,089 from Spain, 7,599 from
South Korea, and 61,929 from the USA. A total of 3,455 medicines were identified.
Common repurposed medicines included hydroxychloroquine (<2% in NFHCRD to
85.4% in HM), azithromycin (4.9% in NFHCRD to 56.5% in HM), lopinavir/ritonavir
(<3% in all US but 34.9% in HIRA and 56.5% in HM), and umifenovir (0% in all
except 78.3% in NFHCRD). Adjunctive medicines were used with great variability,
with the ten most used treatments being (in descending order): bemiparin, enoxaparin,
heparin, ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and
metformin. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin increased rapidly in use in MarchApril but declined steeply in May-June.
Conclusions: Multiple medicines were used in the first months of COVID-19
pandemic, with substantial geographic and temporal variation. Hydroxychloroquine,
azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, and umifenovir (in China only) were the most
prescribed repurposed medicines. Antithrombotics, antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists
and corticosteroids were often used as adjunctive treatments. Research is needed on the
comparative risk and benefit of these treatments in the management of COVID-19.

Key words: Coronavirus, Drug Utilization, COVID-19
What is already known in this topic
• Drug repurposing is a common approach in the clinical management of novel
diseases and conditions for which there are no available pharmacotherapies
• Hydroxychloroquine was widely used in the management of COVID-19 patients
during the early phases of the pandemic
• Recent NIH (and other) guidelines recommend the use of concomitant therapies
including immune-based, antithrombotic, antibiotic and other treatments
What this study adds
• This study demonstrates great variability and extensive drug repurposing and
utilization in the management of COVID-19 patients.
• A wide range of adjunctive treatments has been used, including antithrombotics,
antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists, and systemic corticosteroids.
• Emerging clinical data on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and
azithromycin impacted their rise and rapid decline in use internationally
• Conversely, the use of corticosteroids grew only in more recent months, with little
use in the early stages of the pandemic (January to April)

Background
As of September 01, 2020, there were more than 25 million confirmed cases of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and more than 850,000 related deaths worldwide
1
. Despite a lack of evidence, several medicines were repurposed in the first months of
the pandemic based on in vitro anti-viral activity. As an illustrative example,
hydroxychloroquine obtained emergency approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration on March 28, 2020 which was later revoked on June 15, 2020th 2. More
recently, a few investigational drugs have been tested, with remdesivir being the
frontrunner antiviral after an international placebo-controlled randomized controlled
trial (RCT) showed promising results 3.
In the absence of approved antivirals, the cornerstone of management has been
supportive care, where adjunctive therapies play a major role. Three recognized
adjunctive therapies in COVID-19 are corticosteroids, anti-cytokines (e.g., tocilizumab),
and immunoglobulins (e.g. convalescent plasma) 4. Of these, dexamethasone, and
corticosteroids, have recently been shown to reduce mortality among patients receiving
mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy in a large RCT 5,6. Additional adjunctive
therapies are recognised in recent guidelines, including antithrombotics, statins,
antihypertensives and other concomitant treatments. Clinical guidelines have varied in
their recommendations on COVID-19 treatment geographically and over time 7. In these
circumstances, it is crucial to understand the use of treatments, identify trends of
prescribing and determine rational medication use in different health care settings.
We aimed to characterize the use of repurposed and adjunctive medicines among
patients hospitalized for COVID-19, and amongst those receiving intensive care in
actual practice settings across Europe, Asia, and North America.

Methods
Study Design
Multinational network cohort study based on hospital electronic health records (EHRs),
and claims data. Data from different sites were mapped to the Observational Medical
Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) 8. This approach allowed
contributing centers to execute analytical code in a distributed/federated fashion without
sharing patient-level data.

Data Sources
Data were obtained from USA, South Korea, China and Spain. EHR data from the USA
came from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), STAnford medicine
Research data Repository (STARR-OMOP)9, Premier, Optum© de-identified Electronic
Health Record Dataset (OPTUM), Tufts CLARET (TRDW), and the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). Data from South Korea came from nation-wide claims recorded
in the Health Insurance Review & Assessment (HIRA). Inpatient EHR data from Spain
was obtained from HM Hospitals (HM). Data from China was extracted from nine
hospitals in Honghu, supported by Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, and
contained full EMR data (NFHCRD). Intensive care drug use data was available from
Premier, OPTUM, and VA-OMOP. A detailed description of the databases can be found
in Appendix Table 1.

Study Participants
Patients hospitalized with a recorded diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive test result for
SARS-CoV-2 between January and June 2020 were included. A second cohort of
patients receiving intensive services was identified as a subset of the former, defined by
the initiation of mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation/ECMO,
and/or tracheostomy. Index dates were the date of admission to hospital and the date of
start of intensive services respectively.

Drugs of interest
All medicines prescribed/dispensed during hospital admission and in the month prior
were ascertained for characterization. For the study of medicines used for COVID-19
we assessed all medicines included in at least two RCTs according to the COVID-19
clinical trial tracker 10. The resulting list was circulated to stakeholders with a role in
drug development and research (e.g., key opinion leaders, pharma industry) and drug
regulatory agencies, with all suggestions added to the list. Drugs were classified into
two groups: i) repurposed medicines - those with alternative indications but believed to
be efficacious as antivirals, ii) adjuvant therapies - drugs used for the treatment of
pneumonia or preventing or treating COVID-19 complications 4.

Statistical analyses
Age, sex, and history of medical conditions were summarized as proportions, as
calculated by the number of persons within a given category, divided by the total
number of persons.

Medication use was calculated over two time periods: (1) from 1 to 30 days before
index date; and (2) from index date to 30 days after. Episodes of drug/s use were
defined as starting on the date of first drug exposure and ending on the observed end
date (if available), or inferred (for example, based on the number of days of supply),
with a persistence window of <=30 days permitted between two prescriptions 11. We
computed prevalence of use for each drug and major drug classes in both time periods.
Prevalence of medication use for each time window was determined by the proportion
of subjects who had >=1 day during the time window overlapping with a drug use
period for each medication or drug class of interest. All drugs and additional time
windows (a year prior and on index date) are reported in full and will be updated over
time as more data become available in a dedicated interactive website
(https://data.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis/). All (aggregated) data can
be downloaded from this same website.
As an initial approach to characterize all use of medicines, rainbow plots were generated
for each database. These display the proportion of users of each medicine in the days 0
to 30 from index, using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) groupings
To curtail the long list of adjuvant treatments, we compared the prevalence of use of
adjuvant therapies on -30 to -1 days before diagnosis and 0 to 30 days after (for all
databases in which pre-index data was available). For this, we computed standardized
mean differences (SMD), a widely used method to detect differences, and selected those
with SMD>0.1; or those without use before diagnosis, for display in the main figures.
We created lollipop plots of cumulative incidence of drug use 0 to 30 days after
diagnosis and after hospitalization for repurposed and for adjuvant drugs. Graphs with
the whole list of adjuvants drugs can be found in the supplementary material.
We calculated cumulative incidence of drug use 0 to 30 days after diagnosis for the
selected drugs by month of index date. To ensure enough time points, we selected
databases with 3 or more months of data available. We plotted cumulative incidence of
use per calendar month in the study period.

Results
A total of 10 databases were analyzed, including 71,921 participants: 2,089 from Spain,
7,599 from South Korea, 304 from China, 744 from California, 326 from
Massachusetts, 3,493 from New York, 8,118 from US-wide VA, and the remaining
49,302 from US-wide databases (Premier and OptumEHR). Of these, 11,512
participants (from VA, Premier, and OptumEHR) were included in the intensive care
cohorts.
All the results from this study are available as an interactive website
(https://data.ohdsi.org/Covid19CharacterizationCharybdis/). This website contains both
the summary results presented here, and further details including all medications and
comorbidities recorded for the cohorts of interest.
Baseline characteristics are detailed in Table 1. Age varied slightly across data sources,
but most cases clustered around the ages of 50 to 74 years old. There was a majority of
men amongst those admitted in China (51%), Spain (60%) and the US (50% to 94%),
but not in South Korea (41%).
A total of 3,455 different medicines were administered to the study participants in the
month after hospitalization, as depicted in Figure 1. The ATC groups anti-infectives for
systemic use, treatments for ‘blood and blood forming organs’, ‘cardiovascular system’
therapies, and drugs for the ‘musculoskeletal system’ were consistently seen amongst
the most commonly prescribed.
Among the targeted drugs, the top 10 most common in each of the contributing
databases are reported in Table 2. In addition to hydroxychloroquine, ritonavir,
lopinavir, oseltamivir, remdesivir and umifenovir were the most popular antivirals, with
the latter used exclusively in China. Commonly used adjunctive therapies included
antibiotics, antithrombotics, corticosteroids, metformin, vitamin (C and D) supplements,
antihypertensives, H2 receptor antagonists, and interleukin inhibitors.
Figure 2 shows the proportion of users of each of the targeted repurposed therapies in
the month after hospital admission (circle) and after initiation of intensive services
(triangle, where available) per database. Hydroxychloroquine was the most used
therapy, but with great variability in use ranging from < 2% in China to 85.4% in Spain.
Chloroquine was used in China (11.5%). Umifenovir was the most common treatment
in China, dispensed to 78.3% of patients. Azithromycin was the second in frequency of
use, at a highest of 56.5% in Spain. Lopinavir/ritonavir were the third most popular
treatments, with great heterogeneity in use, ranging from lowest in USA (2.8% in
Optum EHR), higher in South Korea (34.9% in HIRA) and highest in Spain (56.8% in
HM). Oseltamivir was variably used from 0.4% in HIRA (South Korea) to 13.2% in
NFHCRD (China). Other treatments under study (interferon, itraconazole, and
ivermectin) were rarely used (<1%) in any of the databases.

The SMD in the proportion of use for each of the listed adjunctive treatments in the
month before vs after admission is depicted in Supplementary Figure 1, and the
proportion of users in the month after hospital admission for all in Supplementary
Figure 2. The list of ‘shortlisted’ therapies with an SMD>0.1 and their respective
proportion of users per database is plotted in Figure 3. The ten most used medicines
(ingredient level) included, in descending order: bemiparin, enoxaparin, heparin,
ceftriaxone, aspirin, vitamin D, famotidine, vitamin C, dexamethasone, and metformin.
There was great variability in the use of all these medicines internationally across the
participating databases. A 66.7% of people admitted in STARR-OMOP received
corticosteroids, compared to lowest proportions in South Korea (10.4%), a 42.8% in
Spain, and a 40.8% in China. Statins were also commonly used in the USA (up to
58.1% in VA), but less so in Asia (4.6% in China and 13.5% in South Korea) and Spain
(10.9% in HM). Interestingly, vitamin D supplementation was prescribed with great
heterogeneity, ranging from <1.6% in China, 1.4% in Spain, 8.1% in South Korea, and a
variable 3.4% (Premier) to 95.2% (VA) in the USA. Tocilizumab was also variably
used, ranging from <1% in many sites (China, South Korea, NY USA, Premier USA,
CA USA) to 4% in VA, 7.0% in Optum EHR and 9.2% in MA USA, and a striking
16.3% in HM (Spain).
The use of adjunctive therapies (but not of repurposed treatments) increased
substantially in intensive care, with the greatest augmentation seen for systemic
corticosteroids, famotidine, heparin, and tocilizumab.
The management of COVID-19 has changed substantially over time as shown in
Supplementary Figure 3. The time trends in use of hydroxychloroquine are striking,
with rapidly increasing use in February and March, a plateau in April, and a similarly
rapid decline in May that continued in June (Figure 4). Azithromycin followed a similar
trend. Corticosteroids increased in some but not all databases in Apr-May-June.

Discussion
Summary of key findings
This is the first study to describe the management of COVID-19 patients in routine
hospital care across three continents. We report on the use of adjunctive and repurposed
therapies as recorded in electronic medical records and claims data covering a total of
71,921 hospitalized, and 11,512 patients receiving intensive care for COVID-19 in
South Korea, Spain, China and USA.
We observed great heterogeneity in the use of repurposed therapies, with great
variability in the use of hydroxychloroquine internationally and over time. Similar
trends were observed in the use of azithromycin. Great heterogeneity was also seen in
the use of anti-retrovirals, with use of lopinavir/ritonavir ranging from <1% in VA
(USA), almost 37% in South Korea, and highest at >50% in Spain.
Adjunctive treatments have been extensively used for the prevention or treatment of
complications in the management of COVID19, including antibiotics, anticoagulants,
corticosteroids, vitamin D supplements, and to a lesser degree, antihypertensives,
antacids, statins and metformin. Unsurprisingly, the use of adjunctive therapies
increased amongst patients receiving intensive care services.
Hydroxychloroquine has been in the public limelight since the start of the pandemic. Its
use has been supported/endorsed by misleading evidence due to flawed but heavily
publicized studies 12-14. Despite all the hope and hype, numerous RCTs have shown no
benefit. The RECOVERY RCT of 1542 hospitalized participants treated with
hydroxychloroquine showed no effects on 28-day mortality when compared to usual
care 15. Another RCT studied the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure
prophylaxis in 821 asymptomatic participants, for whom the drug was not shown to
prevent any COVID-19 illness after high or moderate-risk exposure to COVID-19 11.
Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic with alleged antiviral efficacy against COVID-19,
was also widely prescribed in our data. While several guidelines recommend the use of
empirical antimicrobial treatment, not all advocate its use 7. Currently, there are 47
RCTs ongoing worldwide, which will hopefully shed some light on the efficacy of
azithromycin to treat COVID-19. Use of protease inhibitors (PIs) lopinavir-ritonavir
was high in South Korea and Spain, with a much lower use in all other databases. This
is consistent with Korean and Spanish guidelines, which recommended PIs as antiviral
treatments 16,17, probably based on in-vitro studies 18. The World Health Organization
has recently decided to discontinue hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir arms in
its SOLIDARITY trial, due to interim results demonstrating little or no reduction in
mortality of hospitalized patients 19. The RECOVERY trial has recently confirmed the
lack of efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir compared to usual care 20. Umifenovir in China
was the most prescribed repurposed medicine, consistent with Chinese guidelines and
research.21,22
Adjunctive therapy/ies to prevent or treat complications were strikingly different across
the globe. Heparin use was widely prescribed across the USA and Spain, but not in
China and South Korea. Corticosteroids use ranged from about 10% of admitted
participants in HIRA (South Korea) to more than 66% of patients in Stanford (CA,
USA). Antibiotics use also varied widely, as did statins.

Use of anticoagulants in our study was higher than expected. Severe COVID-19 has
been associated with a coagulopathy that, when untreated, leads to poor clinical
outcomes 23. While a number of RCTs are ongoing to evaluate the value of
anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19, interim guidelines recommend the use of
anticoagulants for the prophylaxis of thromboembolism 17,24. Prior to the results from
the RECOVERY trial, there was a wide debate on whether corticosteroids have a role in
the mitigation of inflammatory organ injury 25,26. Most clinical guidelines did not
recommend the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 7, with notable exceptions 12,27. Our
results show wide use of corticosteroids internationally.
Our description of patterns in hydroxychloroquine use before and after the publication
of negative RCT results indicated a reversal of pre-existing trends. The drastic decline
in prescribing pattern is an indication of how rapidly the landscape of medication use
changes with the emergence of new evidences. The reverse is also possible, - use of
dexamethasone in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy
would likely increase exponentially in-line with recent results from the RECOVERY
trial 5.
In an attempt to add context to our findings, we conducted a literature review of articles
that reported medication use in patients with COVID-19, of which 45% (n=595)
reported at least one type of treatment for hospitalized patients. The most reported
repurposed therapies were antivirals (25%), antibiotics (19%) and steroids (15%). It is
worth noting though that 52% of the studies were from China, whereas our data sources
were mainly from USA, Spain and South Korea. In addition, medication use has
changed rapidly with the emergence of new evidences, thus findings from China may
no longer be relevant for comparison as the studies were older.

Study limitations
Our study was based on routinely collected real world (EHR and claims) data, where
misclassification of disease and therapies may be present. We only included patients
who had a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis or a positive PCR test at the time of
hospitalization; therefore, patients without a coded diagnosis would have been excluded
even if they were suspected of having the disease. There may also be an underreporting
of COVID-19 cases in clinical settings where testing resources were scarce, especially
during the peak of the outbreak. In addition, medical conditions may be underreported
as the absence of a medical code for the disease is interpreted as an absence of the
disease itself. Exposure misclassification is also possible; participating data sources
varied in their capture of drugs, from hospital billing records, prescription orders, or
dispensing data. Medication use estimates on the date of hospitalization is particularly
sensitive to misclassification and may conflate baseline concomitant drug history with
immediate treatment upon admission. Another limitation was the inability to assess the
prescribing pattern of remdesivir as data was not available in our study. The lack of
information on the dose and duration of medications was another limitation as these are
important information that would have added value to the understanding of prescribing
trends, especially among those in high-risk groups or those who are more susceptible to
medication-related adverse events. While our study adds valuable information to the
understanding of prescribing patterns at the peak of the outbreak, it only provides a

snapshot of medication use in clinical practice, and with the constant emergence of new
evidences over time, medication use in COVID-19 is likely to evolve rapidly.

Conclusions
This is the largest and most diverse study characterizing the management of patients
hospitalized with COVID-19, covering the first 6 months of the pandemic and spanning
across North America, Europe, and Asia. There has been great interest in the safety and
efficacy of medications used for COVID-19 treatment, but little evidence on the
prescribing patterns in routine clinical practice. This study provides an overview of drug
utilization in routine practice and highlights the need for future research on the safety
and efficacy of the more commonly used treatments.
