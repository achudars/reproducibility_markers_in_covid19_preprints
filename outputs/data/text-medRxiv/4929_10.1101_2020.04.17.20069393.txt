Summary

34

Background While the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, there is much concern over

35

the mortality rate that the infection induces. Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate

36

varies temporally (as the epidemic progresses) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted

37

to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries.

38

Methods We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European

39

Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing

40

the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at

41

the individual level (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation). We also compiled data on

42

demography, economy and political regimes for each country.

43

Findings We first showed that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries.

44

We found no evidence for association between comorbidities and case fatality rate at the country

45

level. Case fatality rate was negatively associated with number of hospital beds x1,000 inhabitants. We

46

also report evidence suggesting an association between case fatality rate and the political regime, with

47

democracies suffering from the highest mortality burden, compared to autocratic regimes. However,

48

most of the among-country variance in case fatality rate remained unexplained.

49

Interpretation Overall, these results emphasize the role of socio-economic and political factors as

50

possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the country level.

Introduction

56

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from an animal reservoir in the city of

57

Wuhan, China1,2. Having established a human-to-human transmission, the virus rapidly spread, first

58

within China, and subsequently outside China. Currently, more than 152 countries have reported at

59

least one case of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and on 11th March 2020 the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2

60

as a pandemic3. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) produces a series of respiratory symptoms

61

that vary in severity4. Although, in most infected people the infection results in mild symptoms that do

62

not require particular medical care (or even in asymptomatic disease), in a substantial fraction of

63

patients the disease develops into severe respiratory distress, requiring hospitalization in intensive

64

care units5. In the absence of specific treatments that prevent or block viral replication, a serious

65

matter of concern is the proportion of infected patients that will eventually die. Current data indicate

66

that, worldwide, case fatality rate (CFR, the ratio between number of deaths and number of cases)

67

might be around 2 – 3%. However, at the country level, CFR ranges from 0 to a frightening 12%6. There

68

are many possible reasons for such a variation. First, the epidemic has spread in some countries earlier

69

than in others and therefore the difference in CFR might reflect different stages during the spread of

70

the disease. According to this hypothesis, one might expect an increase in CFR with time in countries

71

where CFR is currently low. Second, at the individual level, clinical data have reported several risk

72

factors associated with a poor prognosis. Age and comorbidities (cardiovascular diseases, cancers,

73

diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases) seem to greatly increase the mortality risk7-10. Therefore,

74

countries with a greater share of elderly in the population, or with higher incidence of recognized

75

comorbidity factors might pay the highest toll to the infection. Third, as said before, in the absence of

76

effective treatments, patients that develop severe symptoms require hospitalization in intensive care

77

units for respiratory assistance. A major concern is that, as the number of infected people increases,

78

the healthcare system will be overwhelmed11. Under this scenario, mortality rate might reflect the

79

country-specific capacity to tackle a large number of patients requiring respiratory assistance and

80

intensive care. Finally, countries might differ in their methodology to count and communicate the

81

actual number of patients that have succumbed from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

82

Here, we conducted an analysis of the factors that might account for the variability of COVID-

83

19 CFR among countries. Using data updated to 4th Avril 2020, we first show that CFR significantly

84

varies between countries, independently from the stage of the epidemic wave. Second, we used

85

country-specific variables assessing the occurrence of comorbidities, as well as demographic,

86

economic and political variables to uncover any association pattern with COVID-19 CFR. Overall, we

87

could only account for a small fraction of the variance in CFR among countries, with no association

88

between comorbidities and CFR. Among the demographic, economic and political variables, only

89

number of hospital beds and the political regime were associated with CFR. These results emphasize

90

the importance of strategic decisions for the management of health crisis during infectious disease

91

pandemics.

92
93

Methods

94

We used data on daily number of confirmed cases and deaths for each countries reported by

95

the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). We computed the case fatality rate

96

as the ratio between deaths and confirmed cases. We restricted the dataset to countries with at least

97

100 confirmed cases to avoid spurious results due to small numbers. For each country, we also counted

98

the number of days between the 100th case and 4th Avril 2020, indicating the progression of the

99

epidemic.

100

We used the online resource https://ourworldindata.org/ to retrieve data on the incidence of

101

known comorbidity factors for each country, as well as information on demographics, economics and

102

political regimes. In particular, we used different metrics to describe comorbidities: 1) disability-

103

adjusted life years (DALYs); 2) age-standardized DALYs per 100,000; 3) share of total disease burden;

104

4) age-standardized death rates per 100,000; 5) share of deaths. We focused on known comorbidities

105

such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. We also included

106

metrics related to factors that might impinge on the severity of respiratory syndromes, such as

107

smoking and air pollution. We also used https://ourworldindata.org/ to retrieve information on

108

demographic, economic and political indicators. Table S1, in the supplementary information, reports

109

the list, description and source of the variables used here, according to the GATHER statement12.

110
111

Statistical analyses

112

We first aimed at exploring whether CFR varied among countries while controlling for the

113

differences in the epidemic progression. To this purpose, we run a linear mixed model where CFR was

114

the dependent variable, time since 100th case (in days) and squared time since 100th case (as to model

115

non-linear variation), country and the two-way interactions between country and time were the fixed

116

factors. Country was also included as a random effect. The covariance structure of R matrix was

117

modeled using a first-order autoregression, to take into account the correlation between values from

118

one day to the other. Degrees of freedom were computed using the Satterthwaite approximation. Only

119

countries for which at least 10 days had elapsed between the record of the 100 th case and 4th April

120

2020 were included in this model, to allow a better estimate of the variation between CFR and time.

121

This model included 89 countries.

122

To assess the pattern of association between country-specific CFR (as assessed on 4th Avril

123

2020) and comorbidities, we ran five multiple regression models that included different metrics. The

124

first model included share of disease burden, the second model included share of deaths, the third

125

model included DALYs per cause, the fourth model included age-standardized DALYs, and the fifth

126

model included age-standardized death rates. All models always included a set of covariates that

127

described demographic, economic and political variables, namely population size, life expectancy,

128

share of the population over 70 years old, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, total health care

129

expenditure as share of GDP, number of hospital beds (x1,000 inhabitants), political regime. This last

130

variable scores political regimes according to the level of democracy, between -10 (full autocracy) to

131

+10 (full democracy) (Polity IV as reported in https://ourworldindata.org/). Finally, all models also

132

included time to the 100th case (in days), as to take into account the different progression of the

133

epidemic in each country. Models were selected using a backward procedure with the criterion for

134

staying in the model set at 0.05. For each variable included in the final model, we computed the partial

135

R2. We also checked model fit and collinearity diagnostics (condition index13). All variables were

136

standardized with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1 to make parameter estimates directly

137

comparable (variables with asymmetrical distribution were previously log-transformed to reduce

138

skewness).

139

Different countries might have similar values of the different metrics used here because of

140

their geographical proximity; in this case considering each country has a statistical unit might violate

141

the assumption of independence of observations. We used Moran’s I coefficient to test if CFR and the

142

explanatory variables were spatially autocorrelated (for each country we used the latitude and

143

longitude of the capital to construct the distance matrix). We subsequently retested the association

144

between CFR and explanatory variables using linear mixed models (LMMs) that, in addition to the fixed

145

effects listed above (i.e., those included in the multiple regression models) also included three nested

146

effects as random variables: continent (5 levels), geographic region (19 levels14) nested within

147

continent, country (102 levels) nested within geographic region nested within continent.

148

To further explore the association between political regime and CFR, the -10 to 10 score was

149

congregated into four classes indicating: 1) autocratic regimes (score from -10 to -6), 2) closed

150

anocracy (from -5 to 0), 3) open anocracy (1 to 5), 4) democracy (6 to 10) (see

151

https://ourworldindata.org/). Anocracy refers to political systems that combine features of both

152

democratic and autocratic regimes, and that are therefore intermediate between the two15. This four

153

level democracy score was included (as a fixed effect) in a LMM where CFR was the dependent variable.

154

Time since the 100th case and squared time plus the two-way interactions with the democracy score

155

were also included as fixed effects, and the three nested effects accounting for the spatial clustering

156

of countries were included as random effects. This model therefore informs us if countries with

157

different levels of democracy have different trajectories of time-dependent CFR.

All the analyses were conducted with SAS 14.3.

Results

161

We found strong evidence for among-country differences in COVID-19 CFR. The LMM showed

162

a highly significant interaction between time since the 100th case and country, indicating that CFR

163

trajectories (both linear and quadratic components), do differ among countries as the epidemic

164

progresses (Table 1, Figure 1).

165

In order to uncover the factors that might account for such among-country variation in CFR,

166

we ran five multiple regression models that included different explanatory variables related to

167

comorbidities, demographic, economic and political factors. These models used CFR estimated on 4th

168

April 2020 as the dependent variable. Among the comorbidity metrics, none was associated with CFR,

169

the only exception being the model on DALYs that showed a positive association between DALYs lost

170

to diabetes, urogenital, blood and endocrine diseases and CFR (Table 2). It should be noted that DALYs

171

are highly correlated with population size and therefore, it is possible that this is a spurious result due

172

to the covariation between the two variables. Using other metrics of comorbidities (share of disease

173

burden, share of deaths, age-standardized death rates x100,000, age-standardized DALYs x100,000)

174

produced no association with CFR (Table 2). Four demographic, economic and political variables were

175

associated with CFR across different models (Table 2). Population size was positively associated with

176

CFR in all models, except the one on DALYs, corroborating the idea that the above reported association

177

between DALYs lost to diabetes, urogenital, blood and endocrine diseases might merely result from

178

the covariation with population size. Number of hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants was negatively

179

associated with CFR in all models run. Life expectancy (in four models) and share of the population

180

over 70 years old (in one model) were positively associated to CFR. Finally, in four models, we found a

181

positive association between CFR and level of democracy. Overall, the amount of CFR variance

182

accounted by the different factors (comorbidities, demographics, economics, politics) was small

183

(around 20% of variance explained by the model), and the partial amount of variance explained by the

184

factors that were retained in the final models was very small (ranging from 2% to 8%).

185

Neighboring countries can have similar values of CFR, comorbidities, economic, demographic

186

and political variables, because of their geographical proximity, violating the assumption of

187

independence of statistical units. A spatial autocorrelation analysis showed, indeed, positive

188

autocorrelation for CFR, life expectancy, share of the population over 70 years, number of hospital

189

beds, and political regime (Moran’s I, all p’s <0.0001). We therefore reran the association models using

190

five LMMs that incorporated the spatial clustering of countries (into continents and geographical

191

regions). These LMMs confirmed 1) the lack of association between CFR and comorbidity factors, 2)

192

the negative association between number of hospital beds and CFR, 3) the positive association

193

between level of democracy and CFR (Table 3). Contrary to the regression models, LMMs that

194

integrated spatial information did not provide evidence for an association between life expectancy (or

195

share of the population over 70 years) and CFR (Table 3).

196

To further explore the association between democracy level and time-dependent variation in

197

CFR, we grouped countries as having an autocratic, closed anocratic, open anocratic or democratic

198

political regime. We then ran a LMM to test whether time-dependent trajectories of CFR differed

199

according to this four level variable. The LMM also included the information on spatial clustering

200

(nested factors declared as random effects). The model showed highly significant interactions between

201

time since 100th case (both linear and quadratic components) and political regime (Table 4, Figure 2).

202

Therefore, CFR increased with a steeper slope in countries with democratic regimes compared to less

203

democratic political systems (Figure 2).

204
205

Discussion

206

As the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic continues to spread worldwide, there is an increasing concern

207

related to the mortality induced by the disease. Currently, some European countries are paying the

208

highest toll to the infection, with case fatality rate between 10 and 12%. In this light, it is important to

8

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069393; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

209

understand why some countries seem to experience lower mortality rate than others and possibly to

210

predict how CFR might change as the epidemic progresses.

211

Assessing case fatality rate during an ongoing outbreak is particularly difficult for, at least two

212

reasons6,16. CFR at a given time might be an underestimate of the final mortality rate because

213

cumulative number of deaths will eventually keep increasing as some patients are still hosted in

214

intensive care units. Conversely, CFR might overestimate actual mortality if a large fraction of infected

215

people do not develop disease symptoms (or develop mild symptoms) and therefore this fraction is

216

not included into the population of confirmed infection cases.

217

Despite the uncertainty associated with the estimation of CFR and how it will evolve over time,

218

its comparison between countries can provide useful insights into the heterogeneity in the current

219

burden paid to the disease. We showed that the trajectories of time dependent variation in CFR greatly

220

differed between countries. This quantitatively corroborates and statistically validates the intuition

221

that some countries are better dealing with the disease than others.

222

The following step was to try to understand whether such heterogeneity arises as the

223

consequence of predictable factors. Previous reports on the clinical outcome of the disease have

224

identified two major factors associated with poor prognosis: age and the presence of comorbidities.

225

Elderly people have been shown to suffer the highest mortality rate following infection with SARS-CoV-

226

2, with case fatality rates possibly higher than 20% in patients older than 80 years6,17. Similarly,

227

previous history of cardiovascular disorders, cancer and diabetes have been reported to substantially

228

increase COVID-19 mortality risk5,18. We therefore predicted that countries with a higher share of

229

elderly people and a higher incidence of known comorbidity factors might suffer from the highest CFR.

230

However, the results did not provide any support for this prediction. Life expectancy and share of

231

populations over 70 years were actually positively associated with CFR when running multiple

232

regression models, but these associations did not receive statistical support when using models that

233

explicitly took into account the spatial clustering of countries.

234

Economic and political parameters might equally well contribute to shape COVID-19 mortality.

235

As the number of severe cases increases during the epidemic, the health care system can get

236

overwhelmed and might be unable to receive and treat all those who need intensive care. Mortality

237

might therefore results from health care systems that are inadequate to deal with large number of

238

cases requiring simultaneous admittance in intensive care units. We used several proxies describing

239

the investment of each country into the health care system and found a negative association between

240

the number of hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants and CFR, and this result was robust to the inclusion

241

of spatial clustering into the model. This result is therefore in agreement with the idea that socio-

242

economic factors are currently playing a role to shape COVID-19 CFR.

243

A final source of variation accounting for differences in CFR might be due to differential reports

244

of number of deaths and/or confirmed cases between countries. This might reflect different

245

counting/reporting methodology (e.g., deciding whether or not a given patient died because of COVID-

246

19). In addition, implementing effective social distancing protocols, that are currently deployed in most

247

of the countries facing the epidemic, might prove more difficult in democratic countries, compared to

248

other political regimes that exert a more stringent control over the population. In agreement with this

249

hypothesis, we found that countries with a democratic political regime had the highest CFR. A further

250

model showed that time-dependent trajectories also varied among countries according to their

251

political regimes, with democracies having the steepest increase of CFR as the epidemic progresses.

252

The role of social and cultural traits in the emergence of zoonotic diseases has already been discussed

253

in the past, including the idea that collectivistic societies might have built as a way to better control

254

epidemic waves19. In agreement with this hypothesis, Morand and Walther20 found that collectivistic

255

societies were less exposed to zoonotic disease outbreaks compared to individualistic ones.

256

Although we report here some associations between economic, political variables and COVID-

257

19 CFR, we fully acknowledge that these factors explain a little fraction of the total variation in CFR

258

among countries. This might come from the coarse grain of the analyses (country level), the error

259

associated with the metrics used in our study, or the uncertainties associated with the estimation of

10

260

CFR while the epidemic is still ongoing. When serological tests will be available, a large-scale

261

assessment of the proportion of the population that has been infected by the virus will provide more

262

accurate data to better estimate COVID-19 CFR and the possible factors explaining the among-country

263

heterogeneity. With this in mind, we nevertheless believe that our results stress the role of socio-

264

economic and political factors as potential drivers affecting how a country deals with globally

265

threatening epidemics. In particular, past decisions on the policy of investment into the healthcare

266

system have the potential to severely impact the whole society when a major sanitary crisis outburst.

267

Another very challenging issue that many countries are currently facing, at the crossroads of our

268

modern lifestyle, is to extent to which democracies are willing to renounce to individual freedom for a

269

collectivistic benefit21.

Table 1. Linear mixed model exploring variation of COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) as a function of
time since the 100th case for each country. The model also included squared time since 100th case and
the interactions between country and time. Country was also declared as a random effect in the model.
The model was restricted to countries that had 10 or more days elapsed between the occurrence of
the 100th case and 4th April 2020 (to allow a better estimate of time-dependent variation in CFR). The
analysis is based on 89 countries and 1,872 observations.

Table 2. Multiple regression models investigating the association between COVID-19 case fatality rate
(CFR) and several descriptors of comorbidities, demographics, economics and political regime for each
country (n = 102). Each model included the same demographic, economic and political regime variables
(GDP per capita, population size, total health care expenditure as share of GDP, number of hospital
beds x1,000 inhabitants, share of the population over 70 years, political regime). In addition, model 1
included variables referring to the share of total disease burden due to cardiovascular diseases,
cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes. Model 2 included variables referring to share of deaths
for cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, lower respiratory diseases, diabetes,
outdoor air pollution. Model 3 included variables referring to DALYs lost to cardiovascular diseases,
cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes. Model 4 included variables referring to agestandardized DALYs lost per 100,000 people. Model 5 included variables referring to age-standardized
death rates due to cardiovascular diseases, cancers, smoking, air pollution, ambient particulate air
pollution, pneumonia over 70 years, outdoor air pollution over 70 years, smoking over 70 years. The
table reports the variables selected by the backward procedure of the multiple regression. Models 1,
2, and 4 retained the same variables in the final model, therefore only the results of model 1 are
reported in the table. We report model R2 and p-values, as well as the standardized slope (95% CI),
partial R2 and p-values of all variables retained in the final models.

Table 4. Linear mixed effect models exploring the association between political system (autocracy,
closed anocracy, open anocracy, democracy) and CFR. The model included time since 100th case and
squared time and the interactions between time and political system. The model also included three
nested factors (continent, geographical region and country) as random effects. Sample size is five
continents, 18 geographical regions, 103 countries and 1,981 observations.

Figure 1. Time-dependent variation in COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR). Time refers to the number of
days between the occurrence of the 100th case and 4th April 2020. The different panels refer to
countries with at least 30 days elapsed since the occurrence of the 100th case. Red lines describe the
observed values, the dotted lines refer to the predictions of a linear mixed model.

Figure 2. Time-dependent variation in COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) according to the political
regime. Time refers to the number of days between the occurrence of the 100 th case and 4th April
2020. The different lines refer to the predictions of a linear mixed model (red = autocracy, orange =
closed anocracy, blue = open anocracy, green = democracy).
