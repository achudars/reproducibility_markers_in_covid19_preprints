Research in context
Evidence before this study: As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, testing capacity
expanded and governmental guidelines adapted, generally encouraging testing with a
broader set of symptoms, not just fever with respiratory symptoms. In parallel, multiple largescale citizen science digital surveillance platforms launched to complement knowledge from
laboratory and somewhat smaller clinical studies. Symptoms such as loss of sense of smell
have been identified as strongly predictive of COVID-19 infection in both clinical and
syndromic surveillance analyses, and have therefore been used to inform these testing
policy changes and access expansion.
Added value of this study: This study identifies symptoms that are or are not consistently
associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity over time and across three country-based
COVID-19 surveillance platforms in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. These
platforms are website and smartphone based, as well as cross-sectional and longitudinal.
The study period of 4 months covers fluctuating COVID-19 prevalence during the fall of the
first wave and, in some areas, rise of the second wave. In addition, the study period overlaps
expansion of test access and test seeking. Importantly, these analyses track and highlight
the value of individual symptoms to predict SARS-CoV-2 test positivity under a range of
conditions.
Implications of all the available evidence: Despite differences in surveillance
methodology, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and disease prevalence, loss of sense of smell
or taste was consistently the strongest predictor of COVID-19 infection across all platforms
over time. As access to testing broadened, the relevance of COVID-like symptoms and
consistency of their predictive ability became apparent. However, confidence bounds
generally widened with a fall in COVID-19 incidence. Therefore, for the most robust
symptom-based COVID-19 prediction models should consider surveillance data during
periods of higher incidence and improved test access, and effect estimates that replicate
across different epidemiologic conditions and platforms.

Abstract
Background: Multiple participatory surveillance platforms were developed across the world
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a real-time understanding of communitywide COVID-19 epidemiology. During this time, testing criteria broadened and healthcare
policies matured. We sought to test whether there were consistent associations of symptoms
with SARS-CoV-2 test status across three national surveillance platforms, during periods of
testing and policy changes, and whether inconsistencies could better inform our
understanding and future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic progresses.
Methods: Four months (1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020) of observation through three
volunteer COVID-19 digital surveillance platforms targeting communities in three countries
(Israel, United Kingdom, and United States). Logistic regression of self-reported symptom on
self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test status (or test access), adjusted for age and sex, in each of
the study cohorts. Odds ratios over time were compared to known changes in testing
policies and fluctuations in COVID-19 incidence.
Findings: Anosmia/ageusia was the strongest, most consistent symptom associated with a
positive COVID-19 test, based on 658,325 tests (5% positive) from over 10 million
respondents in three digital surveillance platforms using longitudinal and cross-sectional
survey methodologies. During higher-incidence periods with broader testing criteria, core
COVID-19 symptoms were more strongly associated with test status. Lower incidence
periods had, overall, larger confidence intervals.
Interpretation: The strong association of anosmia/ageusia with self-reported SARS-CoV-2
test positivity is omnipresent, supporting its validity as a reliable COVID-19 signal, regardless
of the participatory surveillance platform or testing policy. This analysis highlights that
precise effect estimates, as well as an understanding of test access patterns to interpret
differences, are best done only when incidence is high. These findings strongly support the
need for testing access to be as open as possible both for real-time epidemiologic
investigation and public health utility.

Introduction
Participatory syndromic surveillance has informed public health for nearly a decade1,2,
though it was the COVID-19 pandemic that spurred the rapid development of multiple, digital
monitoring platforms3–9 to accelerate our understanding of and response to SARS-CoV-2
globally10. These citizen science initiatives encompass a range of participant interfaces
including website3,5,9, phone5, text message9 and smartphone applications4,6, using crosssectional and longitudinal study designs, and implementing varying degrees of population
sampling or engagement.
Real-time, community-based data from these platforms are strongly complementary to the
so-called “hard outcomes” — i.e. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths11 —
particularly in the setting of inadequate testing, delayed or absent reporting, or when
ascertained outcomes are only among the most severe cases (e.g. clinical features of
hospitalized COVID-19)12,13. As an example of the utility of such platforms, prediction of
COVID-19 infection using symptom-based scores was pioneered using data from these
platforms in response to the limited testing capacity early during the pandemic, and
highlighted early the potential importance of smell and taste disorders8,14.
COVID-19 participatory surveillance platforms function in regions that have been variably
impacted by the pandemic, though there has been no direct comparison of these data.
Testing policies15, test access16, and Covid-Like-Illness (CLI) definitions have also varied
substantially from country-to-country and over time. In many regions, testing was primarily
targeted at those whose symptoms (or exposures) met strict criteria (e.g. fever and
respiratory symptoms)17, and then later CLI symptoms were broadened to acknowledge the
spectrum of COVID-19 presentations18, and to include other, sometimes highly specific
features (e.g. anosmia)19.
With all of these spatio-temporal changes in policies and access, as well as platform-specific
study design features, we sought to identify which symptoms were consistently associated
with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity — and thus might represent the most clinically and
epidemiologically relevant COVID-19 signals. In addition, we hypothesized that the
predictive power of other symptoms evolved over time, in concert with country-specific
testing practices and disease prevalence. Towards this end, we undertook a comparison of
the association of putative CLI symptoms with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing results,
over time, in three countries with different testing policies, and across three citizen-science
digital surveillance platforms.

Methods
Briefly, data from three country-based participatory surveillance platforms, spanning a fourmonth period of observation early in the pandemic (1st April 2020 to 31st July 2020), were
used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for symptoms on self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity
among non-healthcare workers (as healthcare workers generally received different access to
testing). Specifics of each cohort from Israel, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United
States (US), as well as exposures, outcomes, and statistical analysis are in prior publications
and summarized hereafter. Mapping of survey questions across platforms in Supplementary

Study Populations
Facebook/Carnegie Mellon University US COVID-19 Symptom Survey (US)
This research is based on survey results from Carnegie Mellon University’s Delphi Research
Group. The US Facebook COVID-19 Symptom Survey hosted by the Carnegie Mellon
Delphi Research Center provided web-based surveys to Facebook users20. Surveys asked
about geographic location, age, sex, working in a healthcare setting in the prior 5 days
before survey, and the presence of symptoms in the prior 24 hours. Symptomatic
respondents were additionally asked about SARS-CoV-2 test seeking, test access and test
results. From launch 6th April 2020 through 31st July 2020, there were N=6,626,897
anonymous surveys, presumed to be from unique respondents, from 50 US states and the
District of Columbia. Ssurvey sampling strategies are used to increase representativeness of
the US population by sampling from the Facebook active user base and raking across US
census age, sex and geographic region to develop survey weights. Please refer to data
documentation regarding survey sampling methods20. Primary analyses across all cohorts
represent unweighted parameters, as survey weights were not available in the UK and
Israel. Survey-weighted estimates are nearly identical. Supplementary figure 2 and 4 include
sensitivity analyses with survey weights, with filtering by symptom response patterns (as a
proxy for survey misuse, recall bias or severity) and with subsetting on self-reported illness
duration. This study was approved by the Boston Children’s Hospital IRB (P00023700).

UK Zoe Covid Symptom Study App (UK)
The data used for this work was collected through the COVID Symptom Study App,
developed by Zoe Global Limited with input from physicians and scientists from King’s
College London, Massachusetts General Hospital, Lund and Uppsala Universities4. The app
was launched in the UK on March 24th 2020 and at 31st July counted 3,360,949 adult
participants in the UK. At registration, users are asked for personal characteristics (age,
gender, and whether they are a healthcare worker). App users are asked to report their
health status everyday indicating their symptoms, if they experience any. In addition, they
record their test results for COVID-19. Research studies on data collected through the app
are approved by King’s College London Ethics Committee REMAS ID 18210, review
reference LRS-19/20-18210 and all participants provided consent. Thanks to a partnership
between the Department for Health and Social Care, tests were made available to users of
the app upon invitation from the app maintainers (Zoe) from the 26 April 2020. See
Supplementary figure 1 and 3 for a sensitivity analysis of outcomes stratified by test
invitation (to assess the role of test seeking behavior) or using symptom windows that
extend beyond the test date (to compare to the cross-sectional US data). All tests results
were analyzed in the main analysis. Multiple tests per user were censored within the
symptom window following the test, or once a test resulted positive.

Corona Israel (Israel)
The Israel Corona study was collected through an online survey (https://coronaisrael.org/) that
included a one-minute, anonymous, online questionnaire. From the date first published 5 on
14th March 2020 through 31st July 2020, there were N=131,799 completed surveys (15,550
unique users). Survey responses were collected directly through the online platform.
Responders were asked to report information on age, gender, geographic location, prior
medical conditions and whether they are a healthcare worker as well as symptoms

experienced in the prior 24-hours for themselves and for each member of the family.
Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 testing and test results were reported. This study was approved
by the Weizmann Institute of Science review board (IRB). The IRB waived informed consent
as all identifying information was removed prior to analysis.

Study period, inclusion and exclusion criteria
Data from 1st April 2020 (or first testing data acquisition, if later) through 31st July 2020
were aggregated into weeks starting Mondays. The study population was restricted to
respondents self-reporting baseline age 18 to 100 years (US age category > 75 years
inclusive), sex male or female and non-healthcare workers. US survey age-bins assigned
age was the included decade (e.g. 12-24 as 20 years, 35-44 as 40 years, >75 as 80 years).
Users with missing demographic data were excluded.

Exposures (symptoms) and outcomes (COVID-19 test status)
Eleven symptoms shared across at least two platforms were grouped into meta-symptoms
(e.g. myalgias/arthralgias inclusive of muscle pain, joint pain in Supplementary table 1).
Symptoms that were shared but had limited responses, and thus could not be compared (i.e.
abdominal pain, rash, confusion), were excluded. Self-reported symptoms were considered
present if logged within 14 days prior to the COVID-19 test (Israel, UK), or if logged as
present in the prior 24 hours (US), which is also when the test was reported. Sensitivity
analyses of UK data to show the impact of including symptoms following testing (as in the
US), and of US data to show the impact of illness duration are shown in Supplementary
figure 3 and 4, respectively.
The primary outcome was the self-reported result of the SARS-CoV-2 test (i.e. positive
versus negative). A secondary outcome (UK, Israel) included whether testing was completed
(i.e. test obtained versus not). In the US platform, secondary outcomes were whether testing
was sought (i.e. attempted to test versus did not), and whether testing was obtained (i.e.
among those attempting testing, able to test versus not). Testing counts and positive test
proportions were tabulated as the number of users (UK) or surveys (US, Israel) and the ratio
of test positives to total resulted tests. multiple test results could be reported (Israel, UK), if
tests were performed at less than 14 day window, only the first test was considered. Users
were censored for a 14 day window, or after a first positive test.

Statistical analysis
Logistic regression of each symptom (binary) on SARS-CoV-2 test status (binary) adjusted
for age (continuous) and sex (binary) was performed separately in each cohorts, for each
moving 5-week window, plotted on the last week of the interval. Association tests for
secondary outcomes were conducted in a similar manner. Israel’s primary analyses
aggregated across the entire follow-up period due to the smaller sample size.
Supplementary figure 5 is a sensitivity analysis of 5-, 7- and 9-week aggregation windows for
Israel. Analyses were performed using (R 3.6.3 glm (US) and python statsmodels v0.12.0
(Israel, UK).

Country-level testing and case data
We reviewed publicly available data15,21 regarding testing guidelines in each region during
the study period. We specifically sought information regarding the shift in testing criteria from
core CLI symptoms (i.e. fever, respiratory symptoms) to a broader list of CLI symptoms.
Open testing started on March 14th 2020 in the US while broader symptom-based testing
occurred later in the UK (May 18th, 2020) and Israel (June 1st, 2020) 15,19. In addition, these
dates coincided with inclusion of anosmia/ageusia, except for the US (April 5th, 2020).

Role of the funding source
The funding sources played no role in the study design, collection, analysis, interpretation,
writing or decision to submit the paper for publication.

Results
National COVID-19 surveillance platform participants
The study users and survey respondents compared to national demographics are shown
(Table 1). Those participating in technology-based, health-related surveys tend more often to
be female, younger, and healthier than the general population22–24, and this trend is borne
out in these surveillance platforms. Survey-weighted US cohort data was more
representative of the US (Supplementary table 2), but use of survey weights had little effect
on results (Supplementary figure 2). The unweighted data analyses are presented
throughout to be consistent across platforms.

Testing capacity during the fall and rise of COVID-19 cases
During the study period (April through July 2020), SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity was being
scaled up (Figure 1a). Meanwhile, government-reported COVID-19 cases declined after April
2020 (the “first wave” peak) due to a combination of interventions25. COVID-19 cases
recredesced, first in Israel, and then in the US (Figure 1b). This “second wave” took place
after the study period in the UK. National testing data are consistent with platform-specific
testing data (Figure 1c). Additionally, UK platform-invited testing of mildly symptomatic (
Supplementary figure 1) in early May 2020 was followed by nationally-mandated expansion.
The test positive proportion in the government and national surveillance platform trends
(Figure 1d) were generally similar to each other, and to the case data. For the UK, the test
positive proportion remained lower for longer due to rising testing and falling cases. US
survey test proportion was higher but the trend is representative (see Supplementary figure
2 and 3 for weights, incident/prevalent and outlier sensitivity analysis). While there was a
strong national-platform test positive proportion agreement in the US and UK (root mean
square error of 0.06 and 0.03, respectively), there was a discrepancy in the rise in Israel in
the first weeks after introduction of the testing report question, though testing counts were
lower.

Covid-like-symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity over time
Symptom performance as measured by the age- and sex-adjusted OR for the primary
outcome of test positive versust test negative was not constant (Figure 2, top). However,

several symptoms showed consistently strong associations with test positivity across
platforms and over time. These include core CLI components (fever with respiratory
symptoms) that were in the initial World Health Organization CLI definition, as well as the
unusual symptom of anosmia/ageusia (Figure 2, left).
Anosmia/ageusia was, at all times, across all platforms, the symptom with single highest OR
for self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity. The minimum OR (2.61 [95% confidence
interval [1.71;3.98]) was during the lowest incidence following the 18th May 2020 inclusion of
anosmia to UK testing criteria. Broader testing criteria and a rise in cases in the US (Figure
2) was coincident with a rising OR for many symptoms. and Israel (Supplementary Figure 5).
While CLI symptom signals were positive and relatively similar, gastrointestinal symptoms
were equivocal in the UK and Israel. In the US, when restricting to oligosymptomatic surveys
(≤ 5 symptoms self-reported, Supplementary figure 2), nausea and diarrhea, along with
myalgias/arthralgias and pharyngitis, were no longer predictive of test-positivity. We
hypothesize these findings may be due to clustering of symptoms or the phase of illness
when testing completed.
Low incidence generally coincided with wider confidence intervals (see Figure 1). The US
sampling scheme20 may have contributed to the more stable precision, though the timing of
the tests relative to symptoms cannot be ascertained. To evaluate whether symptoms-to-test
timing, illness duration or recall bias (e.g. US test and symptoms surveyed simultaneously)
affects symptom signals, we conducted sensitivity analyses (Supplementary figure 3 and 4).
While inclusion of post-testing symptoms generally resulted in higher effect estimates,
especially anosmia/ageusia, chest pain/pressure, and fatigue/exhaustion, the temporal
patterns of symptoms were similarly consistent.

Covid-like-symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 testing access over time
The Covid-like symptoms of anosmia/ageusia, fever, cough and shortness of breath were
the symptoms most strongly associated with obtaining SARS-CoV-2 testing (by self-report),
regardless of test result (Figure 2, bottom).
Broader testing access and higher incidence (US) was concomitant with higher predictive
power of symptoms. Symptoms became less predictive of test positivity and confidence
intervals widened substantially in the UK with sustained low incidence.
Within the US platform, we assess differences in test seeking behavior from test access
(among those who attempted to get testing). Early in the study period, anosmia/ageusia and
core CLI drove self-reported test access, while test seeking generally paralleled the strength
of the association with test positivity. UK test access was higher, in part because of platforminvited testing of mildly symptomatic users (Supplementary figure 1).

Discussion
Implications of key findings
Here we show convincing evidence that anosmia/ageusia is robustly associated with selfreported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, regardless of the surveillance platform, country, testing
guidelines, or pandemic phase. Overall, anosmia/ageusia was an order of magnitude more
common among those reporting positive (US 43%, UK 44%, Israel 13.9%) compared to
negative (US 5%, UK 3%, Israel 0.17%). This finding supports test access and self-isolation
mandates with anosmia/ageusia19,21,26.
Core CLI components of fever and respiratory symptoms performed well. Importantly,
symptom associations changed with testing expansion and case burden, while some were
inconsistent predictors. These findings highlight key COVID-19 symptoms for multi-regional
syndromic surveillance signals. Furthermore, there is a mandate to discriminate COVID-19
from seasonal respiratory pathogens like influenza27, though there are few data sets1,2 from
which to define discriminating symptoms a priori. A prospective, iterative, surveillance-data
based approach, leveraging national platforms such as these, is likely to play an important
role.
These findings show the power of citizen science in the COVID-19 response. Though
privacy limits validation of anonymous self-reports against health records, the near-real-time
survey-based outcomes closely mirror national trends, and are therefore useful for
“nowcasting” and forecasting 28,29. They also demonstrate the utility of early broad-based
testing in conjunction with population-wide surveillance. Indeed, testing is a cornerstone of
pandemic response, and has presented substantial challenges globally 10,16. We show the
impact of differences in test seeking or access (e.g. core CLI symptoms) and low prevalence
(e.g. larger confidence intervals) on univariate disease prediction. Future directions that build
on these findings include the incorporation of cross-platform, spatio-temporal and and
multivariate effect estimates in the development of global prediction public health tools.
A strength of digital participatory surveillance is that data collection can be initiated rapidly
and tailored to public health needs (e.g. longitudinal disease trajectory, consistent or
representative population sampling) over space and time. However, to conduct this interplatform international comparison of symptom-based COVID-19 prediction, we had to map
survey questions (e.g. subjective fever versus temperature threshold) and account for study
design variation (e.g. US cross-sectional simultaneously queried symptoms over prior 24
hours and any test result, UK included symptom logged 14 days prior to test report).
Sensitivity analyses show our findings are robust to relaxing assumptions such as illness
duration, symptom-to-test window, symptom report pattern, platform-suggested testing and
the use of survey weights. The possibility to be tested multiple times over the course of the
disease was beyond the scope of this study, and not feasible with one-time surveys.
Symptoms that appear at a later disease stage (e.g. shortness of breath) had very wide
confidence intervals, while symptoms that appear in conjunction with others (e.g.
myalgias/arthralgias) were not predictive when filtering on few total symptoms.

Limitations
These findings must be interpreted with the caveat that, by its nature, real-time participatory
syndromic surveillance inherently has potential biases related to (a) generalizability (whether
participants representative of the source population, or have covariates for critical effect
modifiers), and (b) measurement bias (survey question misunderstanding, differential
missingness or error in self-reporting due to incentive to log healthy when being monitored or
misuse one-time surveys), as examples. We compared each platform to national
demographics and outcomes, as well as survey-weighted outcomes in the US. For both the
UK and US platforms, respondents were younger and more often female, similar to
published online survey participation demographics and echoes research showing possible
biases related to use of mobile health devices solutions in the context of symptom reporting
in the COVID19 era 22–24. To address measurement bias, we compared symptom patterns
and symptom windows across platforms; while these affected the magnitude of effect
estimates, the overall trends and the strength of anosmia/ageusia and core CLI symptom in
the prediction of COVID-19 held.

Strengths
Despite these limitations, the strength of this study lies in the combination of data from very
different digital platforms varied in terms of their participants' location (Israel, UK, USA) and
their observation over time (April to July 2020). All three datasets combined are very large in
size (over 10 million respondents) with high numbers of tests (over half a million), and the
capacity to provide automated, aggregate outcomes in near-real time. In addition, the variety
in access to test and healthcare policies as well as the differences in epidemic timeline
across countries make these findings more generalisable.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first cross-country, cross-platform temporal comparison of
predictive symptoms of COVID-19. We demonstrate the generalisability of the unique
symptom of anosmia/ageusia. In addition, the strength of CLI symptoms to predict test
positivity will vary with test access, incidence and phase of illness. This confirmed the
strength of fever and respiratory symptoms as good CLI signals, and importantly strongly
supports early, broad-based, community-wide testing in a pandemic.

Supplementary material

Supplementary figure 1: UK invited testing sensitivity analysis
UK platform primary analysis, invited-test respondents and not invited-test respondents. For
those with repeated tests, negative test results following a positive test were censored. In the
UK study, beginning 29 April 2020, oligosymptomatic individuals were invited to participate in
platform-sponsored SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, regardless of whether they met testing
guidelines in the region. Invited data are plotted starting from the first 5-week bin, while the
full data are plotted from study inception (which includes increasing numbers of invited
tests).
