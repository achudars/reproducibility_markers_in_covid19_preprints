Abstract
Background: Real-world evidence to support the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care (POC) tests in
primary care is limited. As the first point of contact of the health system for most patients, POC testing
can potentially support general practitioners (GPs) quickly identify infectious and non-infectious
individuals to rapidly inform patient triaging, clinical management, and safely restore more in-person
services.
Objectives: To explore the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care testing in primary care services.
Design: A qualitative study using an inductive thematic analysis.
Setting: 21 general practices located across three regions in England.
Results: Three major themes were identified related to POC test implementation in primary care: (1)
Insights into SARS-CoV-2 POC tests; (2) System and organisational factors; and (3) Practice-level service
delivery strategies. Thematic subcategories included involvement in rapid testing, knowledge and
perception of the current POC testing landscape, capacity for testing, economic concerns, resource
necessities, perception of personal risk and safety, responsibility for administering the test, and targeted
testing strategies.
Conclusion: GPs knowledge of POC tests influences their degree of trust, uncertainty, and their
perception of risk of POC test use. Concerns around funding, occupational exposure, and workload play
a crucial role in GPs hesitation to provide POC testing services. These concerns could potentially be
addressed with government funding, the use of targeted testing, and improved triaging strategies to
limit testing to essential patient cohorts.
Key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, point-of-care, diagnostics, rapid testing, implementation, pathway

BACKGROUND
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 is central to the global response to COVID-19. Laboratory-based reverse
transcriptase or digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 has been criticised for
results taking too long, and for requiring specialist operators at certified laboratories [1]. Point-of-care
(POC) tests promise rapid results without the need for specialised facilities but the evidence for realworld SARS-CoV-2 POC tests accuracy, implementation, and adoption is limited.
General practices play an important role in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of infectious diseases
[2-4]. As the first point of contact with the health system for most patients, general practice conducts
over 95% of all health system activity in the UK [5, 6]. POC tests could support general practitioners
(GPs) by rapidly informing patient triage, clinical management and by facilitating in-person consultations
[7]. However, GPs have well documented reservations about POC tests accuracy, over‐reliance on the
tests, costs in the absence of reimbursement, integration into existing clinic workflows, and their overall
clinical utility [8-12].
With so many concerns about POC tests use, it is critical to take account of GPs knowledge and attitudes
about POC tests for SARS-CoV-2 to enable appropriate implementation strategies. We used semistructure interviews to explore GPs views on the impact that SARS-CoV-2 POC tests might have on
general practice, to assess the feasibility of introducing them into general practice, examine the
potential impact on infection control in primary care, and to identify facilitators and barriers to adoption
including attitudes toward SARS-CoV-2 POC tests.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a qualitative study, we used semi-structured interviews to capture GPs perceptions regarding
the integration of SARS-COV-2 POC tests into routine primary care services during the pandemic [13].
Our methods and results are reported in accordance with the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting
Qualitative Research (COREQ) [14].
Setting
We purposefully sampled GPs from a broad geographic distribution of general practices across three
regions of England [15].

With support from three NIHR Local Clinical Research Networks (LCRN), GPs were invited by a
standardised email outlining the purpose of the study. Eligible participants were English speaking,
practicing GPs, providing care during the pandemic. GPs who worked at practices that were closed, or
not providing care services throughout the pandemic, were not eligible. Reasons for nonparticipation
were not elicited. A participant information sheet, visual pathway diagram triaging SARS-COV-2 testing,
and consent form were sent to GPs who expressed an interest. We did not reimburse participants. The
authors had no prior contact or relationships with the majority of research participants.
We obtained written, informed consent from all study participants. Interviewees were asked for
permission to record interviews, and to publish excerpts from interviews. Apart from one participant, all
interviewees granted the team permission to record the interview and to publish deidentified excerpts
from the interview.
The project approved and registered as a service evaluation by the Newcastle Joint Research Office and
recorded on the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospital Foundation Trust’s Clinical Effectiveness Register (Project
no. 10222). The Newcastle University Faculty of Medical Sciences Research Ethics Committee reviewed
the protocol and deemed the work exempt from ethical approval.
Interview topic guide
We used an interview guide to prompt study participants to share their perspectives. The interview
guide was informed by prior research conducted by members of the study team [16-18], informal
discussions with primary and secondary care physicians, and prior studies on the role of primary care
during past epidemics [19-21]. We iteratively refined it after review by a general practitioner (BDN) and
two pilot interviews. A pathway diagram representing patient triage into national SARS-CoV-2 testing
centres was also included to stimulate discussion, based on information extracted from NHS and NICE
guidelines (Supplemental file 1).
Data collection
Semi-structured interviews were conducted via videoconference between September and November
2020 by an experienced male qualitative researcher (PK) and three researchers (one male, two females)
with training in qualitative methods (TH, YY, JA). All interviews lasted between 30-60 minutes. We
documented observations about each interview (e.g., field notes) immediately after each interview. We
continued to recruit and interview study participants until no new themes emerged from the interviews
(saturation) [22].

Data Management and Analysis
Data management and analysis took place from October to December 2020. All interviews were
transcribed verbatim using the Otter.ai software and both interview transcripts and notes were checked,
anonymised, and corrected against the audio files. Transcripts were not returned to participants for
review. Anonymized interview transcripts were securely stored on an encrypted server.
During data collection, the study team met regularly to review content and themes. We used NVivo 1.3
software (QSR International) for inductive thematic analysis [13]. Four researchers coded the
transcripts: a health services researcher (PK), diagnostics evaluation methodologist (JA), biomedical
engineer (TH), and health economist (YY). Transcripts were read and re-read to identify recurring
themes [23]. PK coded transcripts and drafted the codebook using open coding followed by closed
thematic coding to allow the iterative expansion and reduction of themes and subthemes [13]. The
codebook was discussed amongst the research team in weekly meetings. Newly identified themes
(intercoder agreement) relating to the original transcripts were aligned where necessary. Disagreements
were resolved by consensus. Interviews continued until data saturation, determined when the study
team judged that no new themes were identified [24-26]. All four researchers (PK, TH, YY, JA) then reread the results to ensure they reflected the original interview data.
RESULTS
Participants
We recruited twenty-two GPs (10 women and 12 men) from twenty-one general practices across five
regions in the UK (Table 1). All the participants were actively involved in providing remote and in-person
care services to patients during the pandemic.

Involvement in rapid
testing
Knowledge and
perception of the current
POC test landscape

The degree in which GPs are involved
providing POC testing for SARS-CoV-2.
GPs understanding of POC tests currently
in-development or approved for market
use.

“We don't currently have a rapid test. I'd say there isn't current
provision or not through our practice or NHS.” (GP 06)
“I don't know anything about them. I knew that they're very early on
this point of care testing for antibodies but that seems to have gone
away.” (GP 01)

Value to care
management

The perceived value of POC testing to help
in the clinical management of patients.

Capacity for testing

The anticipated impact of implementing
POC tests and fears of overwhelming
primary care services.
Factors related to costs and incentives and
their relationship to workload capacity.
Viewpoints concerning the affect POC tests
would have on service delivery considering
the potential for occupational exposure
and assurance.
Preferences in terms of which staff
member should be assigned to perform the
testing.

“Patients, especially with respiratory symptoms, would benefit from a
rapid testing, because then we can actually see them, or the patients
who have weak symptoms who we don't know if they have got COVID
or not. So, I think it will fit in. It will be immensely helpful.” (GP 10)
“Because primary care doesn't have capacity to test as a general rule.”
(GP 05)

System and

Discussions where GPs preferred to use a
selection criterion strategy to determine
who should be tested.

Testing location

The locational set-up of where and how
general practices would triage and test
patients.

“We've still got to carry on trying to earn our QOF points and so there's
not been any leeway there at all.” (GP 19)
“As an individual practice, I think it's sort of the anxiety to have POC
[tests] and be the contact. How would you practically administer those
tests and what sort of PPE would we need to see these patients?” (GP
01)
“That's not something that my surgery will be keen to provide a GP for,
because you've spent all day taking a sample. And it is something that
personally, I feel that an HCA or, you know, someone of a less extensive
qualification would be able to be trained to deliver” (GP 14)
“You would prioritise that resource to the symptomatic unwell patients
…. The asymptomatic testing really would only be when you've got
plenty of resource to do that because, you know, suddenly your tests
are going to go through the roof.” (GP 09)
“I think if it's just a quick point of care test, I think more practices
potentially might take it up and arrange a thing where they see the
patient in the car park and do a very quick test.” (GP 07)

Themes

127

Our analysis revealed three major themes, and several subthemes (Table 2). Quotes are anonymized to

128

protect participant confidentiality. The following sections describe each of these themes and summarize

129

the key findings with illustrative quotes.

130

Theme 1: Awareness of SARS-CoV-2 testing

131

Involvement in rapid testing:

132

GPs reported limited exposure, experience, and access to SARS-CoV-2 POC tests. All respondents said

133

they did not have access to POC tests.

134

“There was no direct testing available in the COVID Clinic because there was no testing within

135

primary care nationwide, as far as we're aware, and so anybody that needed a test would be

136

directed to the gov.uk website or 119 to get their test done.” (GP 08)

137

GPs said they often received inquiries from patients under the impression that they could access SARS-

138

CoV-2 tests.

139

“We have several people a day asking for tests and we have several people asking why we can't

140

do the tests, and we give them the same answer every time that we don't have access to the

141

tests.” (GP 16)

142

Knowledge of current POC testing landscape:

143

GPs general level of understanding of POC tests varied across practices. In most cases, their knowledge

144

of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests was based on the news or social media leading several of them to express

145

concerns around the limited evidence-base.

146

“Not a great deal because we don't really have much information. I know that there's a swab

147

related [test], what we would call a pregnancy test, or a lateral flow test. But that's basically all

148

what we know.” (GP 14)

149

Although GPs familiarity with these tests varied, there was a broad consensus that the evidence-base for

150

POC tests and their accuracy needs to be improved to raise their confidence in using the tests.

151

“I know that the technology is out there, I don't know how accurate it is, and how easy it is to

152

use. By that I mean, it doesn't sound like very reliable sources. But that is the most, I think that's

153

the quickest way you can get information and you have to be very careful about how you assess

154

whether the data is credible or not.” (GP 01)

155

Value to care management

156

GPs expressed that POC tests could potentially add value to the management of patient care, especially

157

in terms of supporting them in distinguishing between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses to

158

inform effective triaging, and treatment decisions.

159

“I think it will definitely help because if you get a result quite quickly, at least that way you can

160

reassure yourself and the patient quite quickly that they don't have COVID and don't need to

161

self-isolate. You can tell them “You've got a chest infection, here are your antibiotics”. I think

162

that's that would help a lot.” (GP 07)

163

Another anticipated that POC testing would enable them to restore in-person care management for

164

other patient cohorts, particularly those with other respiratory illnesses.

165

“Patients, especially with respiratory symptoms, would benefit from a rapid testing, because

166

then we can actually see them, or the patients who have weak symptoms who we don't know if

167

they have got COVID or not.” (GP 10)

168

Finally, some GPs said that that tests would be useful for cases of opportunistic testing in the event a

169

patient visits the practice for another condition but exhibits COVID-19 symptoms.

170

“They've come with a skin infection on their leg cellulitis and they come down to the practice

171

and it's quite clear when you're seeing them that their temperature may well be due to cellulitis.

172

But they've also got a cough. They've also lost their taste and smell, and they've just been

173

distracted by the cellulitis. You're sitting in front of a patient in a surgery who might have COVID.

174

Now, it makes no sense at all, for me to send that patient away to go to a regional test site, I

175

want to test that patient there.” (GP 21)

176

Theme 2: System and organisational factors related to service implementation

177

Capacity for testing

178

GPs were concerned that offering POC tests would increase attendance and affect continuity of care by

179

drawing resources away from patients with chronic disease or urgent clinical needs.

180

“One of the problems is, in terms of all the other stuff, that primary care has to deal with all the

181

other normal cancer and heart disease and stuff. If primary care gets overwhelmed with testing,

182

it's struggling as it is coping with demand, so it adds an extra layer of demand.” (GP 12)

183

Most of the respondents emphasised that already busy general practices would struggle to handle the

184

potentially large influx of patients requesting SARS-CoV-2 testing.

185

“I don't think it would be able to work through our system because it would overload it… and we

186

know, we can't just manage doing that.” (GP 15)

187

A few GPs considered that testing should be offered based on regional disease prevalence. They were

188

reluctant to provide testing if local prevalence was high but prepared to if local prevalence was low.

189

“If we've got a high prevalence, it's not something we've got the capacity to deal with… But for

190

very low prevalence, speaking like any other standard test I need to complete, I'll be using it

191

with my trained healthcare assistant.” (GP 15)

192

Economic concerns

193

The GPs interviewed indicated that POC tests could add pressure onto general practices who already

194

need to meet targets to generate income. GPs expressed that they would need additional resources to

195

hire extra staff in order to minimise the disruption of existing services to meet their reporting

196

requirements.

197

“I think because there's still an expectation for practices to meet all the targets for everything …

198

is there a way to get another healthcare assistant? For example, a nurse or a GP running this

199

separately with which you know at least that way it wouldn't impact on current services that are

200

having to happen.” (GP 07)

201

One general practitioner mentioned that general practices would willingly adopt POC tests if financial

202

incentives were introduced to perform the testing.

203

“If you monetize the process, we will look at it…. I think if you monetize this and set up a

204

protocol, a lot of GPs will look at it.” (GP 01)

205

There were also concerns about the additional costs relation to procuring infection prevention easures.

206

“You've got extra cleaning fees for the room… glass screens at reception are thousands of

207

pounds.” (GP 15)

208

Theme 3: Practice-level implementation and service delivery strategies

209

Risk mitigation

210

Some GPs felt that negative results from POC tests could reassure staff and patients that they are at a

211

reduced risk of exposure during face-to-face consultations.

212

“I think it definitely would make us feel safer again and I think more importantly it would make

213

other patients feel safe because we do still have patients who are very frightened about coming

214

to use our facilities.” (GP 19)

215

The use of POC tests in general practice could also give GPs more confidence to invite the patients into

216

the clinic, given they were presently reluctant to offer a face-to-face assessment.

217

“I think it will improve (and) it will make us more confident in face-to-face consultations. So,

218

we've got a huge population with respiratory illness, especially COPD. I think these are the

219

patients who kind of have been missed out on getting seen.” (GP 10)

220

However, GPs also explained that there was an increased risk of staff anxiety and absence if there was

221

increased risk of occupational exposure to potentially infectious individuals booking appointments to get

222

tested.

223

“Some people wouldn't come into work, because they would say it's not safe for them to come

224

into work.” (GP 17)

225

Responsibility for administering the test.

226

Health care assistants (HCAs) or nurse practitioners were identified by most interview participants as the

227

most suitable and cost-effective GPs to administer POC tests.

228

“It's a skill that needs to be learned, but it's quite a simple one. You need someone who's

229

focused on just that one problem. But it's also time consuming. So, nurse practitioners but they

230

are a lot more expensive. So, you want someone who's not gonna be huge cost and resources.”

231

(GP 15)

232

Participants reported that this would also ensure that GPs could devote their limited face-to-face time

233

with patients to provide clinical care as opposed to performing POC tests.

234

“I'd see it probably more being a nurse or a healthcare assistant if it's just the point-of-care test.

235

It's all about kind of using skills appropriately, isn't it? And obviously trying to free up the doctor

236

time for more doctory things really.” (GP 09)

237

Targeted testing strategies

238

Several GPs suggested that testing resources should be reserved for use based on clinical need. They felt

239

that testing should be allocated to unwell patients.

240

“It should be at the discretion of GPs to test when they feel that it is clinically necessary for

241

patient care… For people who don't need any clinical input, I don't want to see 50 patients lined

242

up in the morning to have a COVID-19 test. This should not be an alternative to the drive thru

243

testing or the walking testing. It should be for safe patient care, where they actually need to be

244

seen.” (GP 10)

245

There was a consensus amongst participants that testing should only be reserved for patients who are

246

considered high-risk or vulnerable, require in-person consultation, and are unable to travel to a testing

247

centre.

248

“I'd choose the high-risk groups first, but the frail people who can't travel and a lot of anxious

249

people with lung conditions. Probably people who've got mobility problems, difficulties getting

250

to test centres.” (GP 15)

251

Testing location

252

GPs said that testing should be conducted outside to reduce the risk of infection inside the practice.

253

“If it's a point-of-care test, maybe something even in a car park, where you've got someone

254

driving through and you do a test and they drive off with the result straightaway if possible, or

255

you phone them back if something's longer” (GP 07)

256

A few respondents said that if there was a high volume of testing, POC tests should be offered at a

257

separate mass testing site to reduce the risk of transmission.

258

“I think there should be a separate site rather than the general practice where they can get that

259

rapid test, just to reduce potential risk of cross infection.” (GP 09)

260

However, some GPs believed that testing patients in a hub nearby the clinic would be the most

261

appropriate option.

262

“We're talking about like a porta cabin or something separate somewhere from the building by

263

you, we can see our own patients, or we open up our red hub again, and we can see our own

264

patients, because we're the only ones that really know them.” (GP25)

265

DISCUSSION

266

We found multiple challenges to adoption of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests in primary care. GPs had significant

267

reservations based on the limited information available, an overwhelming workload, and the potential

268

for increased occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. GPs were more likely to adopt POC tests if

269

conducting testing added value to care management, if additional resources were made available to

270

offset the increased workload, and evidence was available to assure them that POC tests would reduce

271

occupational and patient exposure.

272

Comparison to the existing literature

273

Occupational exposure was a concern amongst the GPs we interviewed as increased interaction with

274

patients would entail staff being exposed to more potentially infectious individuals. Increased

275

occupational exposure to patients has been linked with increased stress and anxiety amongst healthcare

276

workers related to being infected and infecting their families [27-32]. Without establishing and

277

communicating the risks associated with the introduction of POC tests, GPs may not feel reassured by

278

testing, which they fear could result in staff absenteeism during a pandemic [33-39]. Education and

279

pandemic response training may mitigate fear and absenteeism among clinicians [40, 41].

280

GPs had limited awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 POC tests. Although GPs were somewhat familiar with

281

some types of POC tests, most of their understanding was sourced from various mass media, and they

282

report concerned with the lack of robust ‘real-world’ evidence [42-45]. This suggests that GPs current

283

attitudes and expectations of SARS-CoV-2 POC tests are shaped by a combination of knowledge gaps,

284

perceived risks, and uncertainties. These factors are consequential as they are critical determinants that

285

inform decisions and behaviours [46-49].

286

There was a consensus amongst interview participants that HCAs should administer POC tests. Part of

287

this motivation was that HCAs are cost-effective, and are accustomed to taking on responsibilities that

288

remove burdens from GPs and nurses [50, 51]. This reasoning resonates with previous work exploring

289

team-based models in primary care focused on the redistribution of tasks among care team members.

290

Optimising workforce capacity by re-delegating tasks to non-medically qualified staff members can help

291

GPs and nurses can prioritise unwell patients requiring treatment [52-57]. However, we did not seek the

292

views of HCAs.

293

Implications for research and practice

294

It may be necessary to incentivise POC tests in primary care [58-61]. GPs argued that increasing capacity

295

to deliver POC tests is dependent on securing additional funding to create the necessary infrastructure.

296

Alternative time-limited funding arrangements may be needed to increase capacity for POC tests use,

297

such as the Alternative Provider Medical Services (APMS) contract, to cover all associated costs until the

298

pandemic has passed [62]. Workforce optimisation strategies to share resources between general

299

practices across the ‘primary care network’ (PCN) could offset workload burden for individual practices

300

[63]. However, this may not be a sustainable approach across England given the high variability between

301

PCNs organisational structures and characteristics [64]. GPs suggested that outdoor testing stations

302

would facilitate infection control and reduce the need for patients to travel to distant community testing

303

sites [65], especially frail patients, and or those without vehicles [66]. GPs expressed a strong preference

304

for modular buildings, portable cabins or tents in practice carparks that could be used to triage and

305

dispatch patients and assess contamination risk. This approach is supported by evidence from secondary

306

care from both the COVID-19 and previous SARS pandemic [67-69].

307

GPs indicated that POC testing could add value to patient management if it served as a discriminator

308

between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. For instance, reliably distinguishing between COVID-

309

19 and influenza clinically is impossible because of the overlap of clinical presentations [70-72].

310

This suggests that POC testing that can facilitate syndromic testing could provide value in guiding clinical

311

management. Thus, future developments for SARS-CoV-2 POC tests could help meet GPs clinical needs

312

of distinguishing between respiratory illnesses by focusing on multiplex testing. Related studies in

313

secondary care suggests that multiplex testing for influenza and RSV can a positive impact on patient

314

management and is associated with more appropriate clinical decisions, reduced antibiotic use, timelier

315

infection control measures, more appropriate antiviral management, and reduced costs in secondary

316

care settings [73-77].

317

POC tests are less efficient and more error-prone when handled by non-laboratory trained individuals

318

[78, 79]. For instance, the accuracy of a lateral flow immune assay for SARS-CoV-2 dropped significantly

319

when used by non-laboratory trained professionals [80]. As GPs identified HCAs as the ideal candidates

320

to administer the POC tests this raises questions about the training required to ensure they are

14

321

administered correctly. We suggest studies developing training protocols and standard operating

322

procedures for individuals without medical or laboratory backgrounds to minimize inaccurate results

323

and test failures [81]. The role of POC tests in home visiting and out-of-hour services warrants further

324

investigation [82] [83].

325

Strengths and Limitations

326

A strength was the qualitative methods we used. They allowed us to explore the views and experiences

327

of general practice staff in an in-depth and descriptive manner. The topic guide was piloted with two

328

GPs who were not participants in the study, with minimal changes recommended. Although the sample

329

size was small, we achieved information saturation appropriate to a qualitative study design when no

330

new themes were discovered during the interviews [22]. Concurrent thematic analysis ensured that data

331

saturation occurred before data collection was complete.

332

A limitation is that we included general practices from only three regions of England, which may not

333

have captured the variation in clinical practice and might therefore limit the generalisability of findings.

334

The interview participants did not include any nurses and HCAs, who are likely to have play a central

335

part of POC use in primary care. Lastly, the interviews occurred between the 25th of September 2020

336

and the 27th of October when the COVID-19 situation in the UK was changing rapidly, immediately prior

337

to the second national lockdown in November 2020. It is possible participants priorities may have

338

changed subsequently.

339

CONCLUSION

340

We explored the perspectives of general practice staff on adopting SARS-CoV-2 POC tests into clinical

341

routine practice. Our findings highlight that GPs awareness of the POC testing landscape varies, as do

342

their perception of risk, and uncertainty regarding the adoption of these tests. Our interviews revealed

343

concerns around the support general practices would need to manage the additional workload, staffing,

344

and risks of occupational exposure. General practices would be willing to provide point-of-care testing

345

services if these concerns could be mitigated through increased government funding, and targeted

346

testing and triaging strategies to limit testing services to essential patient cohorts. Our findings provide

347

important information that can inform policy development concerning planning and implementation of

348

mass testing programmes for COVID-19 and future pandemics.
