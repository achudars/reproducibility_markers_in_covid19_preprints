Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people with substance use disorders (SUDs)
worldwide and healthcare systems have reorganized their services in response to the
pandemic.
Methods: One week after the announcement of the COVID-19 as a pandemic, in a global
survey, 177 addiction medicine professionals described COVID-19-related health responses in
their own 77 countries in terms of SUD treatment and harm reduction services. The health
response is categorized around (1) managerial measures and systems, (2) logistics, (3) service
providers and (4) vulnerable groups.
Results: Respondents from over 88% of countries reported that core medical and psychiatric
care for SUDs had continued; however, only 56% of countries reported having had any business
continuity plan, and, 37.5% of countries reported shortages of methadone or buprenorphine
supplies. Participants of 41% of countries reported partial discontinuation of harm-reduction
services such as needle and syringe programs and condom distribution. 57% of overdose
prevention interventions and 81% of outreach services also having been negatively impacted.
Conclusions: Participants reported that SUD treatment and harm reduction services had been
significantly impacted globally early during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our findings, we
provide a series of recommendations to support countries to be prepared more efficiently for
future waves or similar pandemics to 1) help policymakers generate business continuity plans,
2) maintain use of evidence-based interventions for people with SUDs, 3) be prepared for
adequate medication supplies, 4) integrate harm reduction programs with other treatment
modalities and 5) have specific considerations for vulnerable groups such as immigrants and
refugees.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was announced as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020 ("Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic," 2020).
COVID-19 quickly became a global concern given the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the
infectious agent), lack of a vaccine or evidence-based treatments, person-to-person airborne
spread of SARS-CoV-2 and high mortality of COVID-19 in specific populations, especially
marginalized groups and/or those with pre-existing conditions (Han, Kim, Chung, Park, &
Cheong, 2018; Masozera, Bailey, & Kerchner, 2007; Onder, Rezza, & Brusaferro, 2020). Lack of
capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from COVID-19-related health
consequences are related to individual vulnerability (Adger, 1999). To manage the current
situation as best as possible, vulnerable groups should be recognized and helped with special
considerations by relevant health systems (Marsden et al., 2020).
According to the World Drug Report 2020, among approximately 269 million people with pastyear drug use, over 35 million people experienced substance use disorders (SUDs) (Knopf,
2020). People with SUDs (PWSUDs) may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and
complications for multiple reasons (Volkow, 2020). PWSUDs experience underlying diseases
that constitute risk factors for COVID-19 infection or can be exacerbated by it; for instance,
long-term use of substances may cause cardiovascular problems (Havakuk, Rezkalla, & Kloner,
2017) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Riezzo et al., 2012). Such co-morbidities may
exacerbate superimposed COVID-19 symptoms and lead to higher mortality rates (Arya &
Gupta, 2020; Lai, Shih, Ko, Tang, & Hsueh, 2020). Poor immune system functioning is also
prevalent in PWSUDs as a result of chronic alcohol and drug use and blood-borne or sexually
transmitted illnesses (Cook, 1998; Szabo & Mandrekar, 2009), poor nutritional status
(Bhaskaram, 2002), and socioeconomic factors (Spooner & Hetherington, 2005). Among
PWSUDs, people who inject drugs (PWIDs) are at particularly high risk of COVID-19, as well as
overdoses, unsafe injections and risky sex (Vasylyeva, Smyrnov, Strathdee, & Friedman, 2020).

Psychological conditions (e.g. phobia, anxiety and panic attacks) during natural disasters and
pandemics that may precipitated, perpetuated or exacerbated through social isolation and
quarantine, may lead at-risk people to start and/or relapse into drug-taking (Arya & Gupta,
2020; Nobles, Martin, Dawson, Moran, & Savovic, 2020). Psychiatric comorbidity has a negative
impact on recovery from COVID-19 and may increase risk of non-fatal and fatal overdoses and
suicides (Clay & Parker, 2020; De Sousa, Mohandas, & Javed, 2020; Frank, Fatke, Frank, Förstl,
& Hölzle, 2020; Nobles et al., 2020). In the general population, COVID-19 and related concerns
such as potential mortality may act as internal stressors (Liu & Doan, 2020) and promote
cognitive impairments (Zarrabian & Hassani-Abharian, 2020) in domains such as decisionmaking (Starcke & Brand, 2012), problem-solving (Cheng & Lam, 1997), and attention (Dutra,
Marx, McGlinchey, DeGutis, & Esterman, 2018), and thus may increase the incidence and
prevalence of psychiatric disorders including PWSUDs (Fiorillo & Gorwood, 2020; Pfefferbaum
& North, 2020).
Stigma may undermine social cohesion, contributing to situations in which the virus is more,
not less, likely to spread. Such spread may result in more severe health problems and
difficulties controlling a disease outbreak (Ren, Gao, & Chen, 2020). There is an elevated
likelihood for PWSUDs to be homeless and live in crowded shelters and neighborhoods
(Coetzee & Kagee, 2020). Synergistically, poor economic status linked to limited accessibility to
health care (Ahern, Stuber, & Galea, 2007; O’Sullivan & Bourgoin, 2010) may exacerbate risks
for PWSUDs and PWIDs (Vasylyeva et al.; Ying, Yang, & Jianming, 2020). Drug supply chains
may be disrupted, and changes in licit and illicit markets may be accompanied by reductions in
quality and safety (Knopf, 2020; Nagelhout et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2016; EMCDDA,
EUROPOL, 2020).

Furthermore, patients’ accessibility to treatment services could be restricted due to lockdown
policies (Bojdani et al., 2020; Roncero et al, 2020). Patients receiving opioid agonist treatment
(OAT) may not be able to access daily doses of medications (Arya & Gupta, 2020); spatial
distancing may make home detoxification difficult; closing of non-essential services and utilising
staff and other resources to manage acute COVID-19 cases could result in sudden and

substance may be particularly impacted (Mellis AM, In press). Adaptive capacities of systems to
epidemic situations that need coordinated responses may relate directly to vulnerabilities of
the same systems (Smit & Wandel, 2006). Accessibility to and equal distribution of wealth
(financial and other resources, reliable and correct information and communication channels,
appropriate and proportionate working technologies) compounded by reductions in social and
relationship capital may impact social resilience to coping with pandemics (Dolan & Walker,
2006).
To understand better complexities that are challenging addiction treatment and harm
reduction services globally, the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) has been
conducting a longitudinal global survey aiming to evaluate rapidly and over time how different
countries are maintaining and/or reorganizing their substance use treatment and harm
reduction services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper will report on how different
countries have adapted their health system response to emerging needs in the first month after
the official announcement of the pandemic by the WHO.

2. Methods
Description of the methodology used for this survey has been published as a study protocol
(Baldacchino et al., 2020). Potential respondents were contacted on April 4th, 2020 asking about
the COVID-19 pandemic impact on PWSUDs in their own countries. Data collection was
concluded on May 8th, 2020.
2.1. Questionnaire
The questionnaire consisted of 92 questions in two main areas: (1) situation assessment during
the pandemic; and, (2) health responses to the pandemic. This paper will focus on health
responses during the COVID-19 pandemic period (Baldacchino et al., 2020). Results on the
situation assessment is reported in another publication (Farhoudian, Radfar, et al., 2020).
Questions around health responses to the pandemic were grouped into 3 categories:
(1) Systems available to respond to acute emerging needs due to the COVID-19
pandemic within substance use services;

(2) Availability of protocol and/or guidelines around COVID-19 and PWSUDs; and,
(3) Reduction in face-to-face contacts as a result of lockdown policies.
To assess respondents’ overall views, they were asked to score the “overall situation at a
glance” rating scale questions (RSQ) (between 1 to 10 with 1 for the worst situation and 10 for
the best situation) based on their opinion regarding the overall quality of the situation of their
country for each of the above 3 sections.
2.2. Categorization of countries based on their income
The 2019 statistical annex of World Economic Situation and Prospects (WESP) ("World
Economic Situation and Prospects 2019," 2019) was used to categorize responding countries.
Very low- and low-income categories were merged into one, retaining middle- and upperincome countries designations. In figures, countries’ names are sorted alphabetically in each
group of high-, middle- and low-income categories. The number of respondents (for countries
with more than one respondent) is indicated in front of their names, and numbers in each
column represent valid responses from each country.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA) and
RStudio (version 1.2.1335). Descriptive data are presented as means and percentages for each
country’s response mean (percentage), as well as an average to the global responses.
2.4. Ethics Approval
The survey protocols and all materials, including the survey questionnaires, received approval
from the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, ethics committee in Tehran,
Iran (Code: IR.USWR.REC.1399.061).

3.2. Implementing business continuity/contingency plans

Among respondents from high-income countries (N=95), 69% answered that business
continuity/contingency plans had been implemented in their countries to make sure that
services continued to operate for PWSUDs during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 40.7%
in middle- income (N=34) and 53.8% (N=48) in low-income countries. Overall, respondents from
56% of participating countries reported that business contingency plans had been arranged to
help ensure that continuity of services during the pandemic (Figure 2).

associated with each country show the survey respondents who reported having experienced limitations regarding the question
in their country (Yes), and the grey bars shows the survey respondents who reported having experienced no limitations
regarding the question in their country (No). The dark green bars show the overall responses in each category (low-income,
middle-income and high-income) as well as overall responses.

3.3. Availability and accessibility of treatment and harm reduction services

Among respondents from high-income countries (N=95), 57% answered that treatment and
harm reduction services for PWSUDs had been available and accessible in their countries during
the pandemic onset compared to 51.6% in middle- (N=34) and 63% in low- (N=48) income
countries. Overall, respondents from 59% of participating countries reported that treatment
and harm reduction services for PWSUDs had been available and accessible during the initial
period of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 2).
Respondents from over 81% of participating countries (N=77) reported having experienced
limitations in the usage of any outreach services due to lockdown policies for homeless
PWSUDs. Furthermore, respondents from 57% of participating countries reported having
experienced limitations in their harm reduction overdose services during the initial period of
the pandemic. Problems with the distribution of take-home naloxone were reported by
respondents from 57% of participating countries. Respondents from 54.8% of the participating
countries reported shortages in needle and syringe programs (NSPs) and/or with respect to
condom distribution.
3.4. Medical and psychiatric care during the initial period of the pandemic

Among respondents from high-income countries (N=95), 90% answered that medical and
psychiatric care for PWSUDs had been available during the initial stages of the pandemic
compared to 77.4% in middle-income (N=34) and 79.5% in low-income (N=48) countries.
Overall, respondents in 88% of participating countries reported that necessary medical and
psychiatric care for PWSUDs had continued in their countries during this period (Figure 2).
However, respondents in 37.5% of participating countries reported having experienced
shortages of opioid medications (methadone or buprenorphine).

Only 44.3% of respondents from high-income (N=95), 32.2% from middle-income (N=34) and
40.1% from low-income (N=48) countries reported that COVID-19 screening and/or diagnosis
test kits based on local/national guidelines for PWSUD had been available in their country.
Overall, respondents from only 48% of the participating countries reported that there had been
enough personal protective equipment (PPE) available for PWSUDs during the initial stage of
the pandemic. Respondents from 77.7% of participating countries reported SUD health
workers’ safety as a concern for employers in the outpatient treatment centers, 66.4% had
received training regarding their safety and 72.9% reported that they had had access to enough
PPE.

3.5. Health Policies for COVID-19 among PWSUDs

Overall, respondents from 48% of the participating countries reported the presence of local
and/or national guidelines tailored to be used during the initial stage of the pandemic (60.2% in
high-income, 57.1% in middle-income and 29% in low-income countries). Among respondents
from high-income countries, 65.7% answered that there had been a protocol available for
COVID-19 screening in different sectors of treatment for PWSUDs or harm reduction facilities
compared to 60% in middle-income and 82.3% in low-income countries.

Over 76% of respondents from high-income, 63.3% from middle-income and 63% from lowincome countries reported that there had been guidelines available that helped service
providers in the management and/or referral of PWSUDs with symptoms of COVID-19.

Most respondents replied that there had been plans to restrict personal contacts and decrease
patients’ commutes for treatment in their countries (86%, 90%, 86.6% in high-, middle- and
low-income countries, respectively and 85% overall) due to their national and regional
lockdown policies.
As a result, respondents from 80% of the participating countries reported that clinicians had
been prescribing longer-period prescriptions (e.g., 28 days rather than weekly) to PWSUDs
during the onset of the pandemic (Figure 5).
Additionally, around 69% of participating countries reported that clinicians within OAT
programs had provided more take-home doses of methadone and/or buprenorphine during the
onset of the pandemic. Regionally, 61.6% of respondents from high-income, 50% from middleincome and 27.7% from low-income countries reported this approach had been used in their
countries (Figure 5).
Respondents from high-income countries most frequently reported having had availability of
long-acting injectable buprenorphine (34.9%; n=63). Overall, respondents from 22% of
participating countries reported that long-acting injectable Buprenorphine had been available
as a therapeutic option.

4. Discussion
The emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020 raised considerable challenges for substance use
treatment and harm reduction programs around the world as reflected in this global survey.
The need for effective spatial distancing and isolation to protect patients, the treatment
workforce, and people in contact with patients and health workers has placed increased
demands on treatment services provision, with potential imbalances in impact on particularly
vulnerable patient populations (Mellis et al., in press). Here, in this global survey we have
explored different challenges and health responses in 77 countries. Our findings showed that
respondents from 56% of participating countries reported business contingency plans had been
arranged to help ensure that services would continue to operate during the pandemic, which is
compatible with responses to another question indicating that 41% of respondents believed
there had not been sufficient availability and accessibility of treatment and harm reduction
services during the onset of the pandemic in their countries at the time of survey completion.
As a preventative measure to reduce COVID-19 spread, all international and national published
guidelines advised limited but effective ways regarding how to initiate treatment, support

stabilization and maintenance and continue to provide harm reduction measures to treatmentseeking and other populations with substance use problems (Farhoudian, et al., 2020; Marsden,
et al., 2020) . These recommendations often included extending flexibility in OAT services with
reduced supervision of doses and increased home delivery (Dunlop et al., 2020; Peavy et al.,
2020). Another step taken to adjust to the present situation included expanding telemedicine
and teletherapy services (Farhoudian, Baldacchino, et al., 2020; Knopf, 2020; Elizabeth A
Samuels et al., 2020; Mellis et al., in press).

The COVID-19 pandemic issynergistic interacting with a substance use epidemic globally
creating a syndemic (defined as a synergistic epidemic, the aggregation of two or more
concurrent or sequential epidemics, which exacerbate the prognosis and burden of disease
(Singer, Bulled, Ostrach, & Mendenhall, 2017)). During the COVID-19 pandemic, marginalized
people including PWSUDs are at greater risk of increased morbidity and mortality (Dorahy et al.,
2015). These syndemically disadvantaged populations may be more likely to experience
disparate, possibly substandard, service provision in systems prioritizing resource needs around
a pandemic response (Inverse Response Law and Inverse Care Law) (Phibbs, Kenney, RiveraMunoz, & Huggins, 2018). Such inequities may present at macro levels around effective and
appropriate policymaking at national, organizational, and local levels (Phibbs et al., 2018; Watt,
2002) and at micro levels around areas of access to resources, social services, public health
benefits of medical treatments, pharmacies, health care facilities and provision of medical
equipment (Davis, Wilson, Brock-Martin, Glover, & Svendsen, 2010; Runkle, Brock-Martin,
Karmaus, & Svendsen, 2012; Watt, 2002).
Proactive business continuity plans for PWSUDs are important for all governments as part of
COVID-19 re-mobilization plans and possible future responses to similar pandemics to support
and avert delays and inequities in responses. PWSUDs are at risk for negative impact of COVID19 (Khatri & Perrone, 2020; Volkow, 2020), and our findings showed that 88% of respondents
reported continuity of other necessary medical and psychiatric care compared to less than 60%
who reported existence of business continuity/contingency plans and enough availability and
accessibility of treatment and harm reduction services for PWSUDs. These findings suggest that

policymakers and health authorities in each country could have possibly made more
appropriate decisions in order to protect at-risk and marginalized PWSUDs including those who
may be homeless, have HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, or multiple and complex morbidities. Such
decisions may involve considering how best to provide scheduled and new appointments and
prescription medications in the circumstances of lockdowns.
Based on our finding in this global survey, we provide the following recommendations.
RECOMMENDATION 1: International organizations such as the WHO and United Nations Office
of Drug Control (UNODC) and other related groups such as the International Society of
Addiction Medicine (ISAM), International Society of Substance Use Professionals (ISSUP), and
World Federation Against Drugs (WFAD) should provide adequate support to raise
policymakers’ knowledge in the area of addiction medicine on how to establish business
continuity committees during initial stages of pandemics in order to make advanced care
planning decisions through effective leadership.
Continuity of services especially in crisis situations needs certain, evidence-based, and locally
tailored protocols and guidelines. In our study, addiction medicine professionals reported that
most of their countries did not provide early guidelines or protocols to tailor their services to
the pandemic. It is important to consider that respondents in only one-third of low-income
countries reported the availability of such guidelines compared to respondents in half of highincome countries. Another survey (Mongan, Galvin, Farragher, Dunne, & Nelson, 2020)
conducted in four high income regions (New South Wales, Ireland, Scotland, New York State,
and British Columbia) found that special guidelines in response to the new situation and
assurance of continuity of the services were available very soon after the start of lockdown,
which is consistent with our findings that high income countries had a more timely response in
this domain. In the absence of guidelines and protocols, clinicians and service providers may
not effectively balance different competing ethical and professional issues when they are
making clinical and operational decisions when many things may be happening that could
potentially be conflicting in nature (e.g. maintaining stability but reducing therapeutic
contacts). Guidelines also allow stakeholders to improvise and identify innovative ways through

evidence-based solutions to help decrease the dual burden of substance use and COVID-19
infection (Samuels et al., 2020; Sokol, Gupta, Powers, Hoffman, & Meza, 2020).

RECOMMENDATION 2: Governments and local authorities should be cognizant that an
effective response system is based around a well informed and supportive environment.
Available and communicated international and national clinical guidelines are pivotal in future
responses to similar pandemics when supporting PWSUDs.

The World Drug Report 2020 stated that, “If Governments respond the same way to the current
economic slump, interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviors and
drug treatment services could be hard hit” (Nations, 2020). Substance use accounts for
approximately 11% of the global health burden (Forouzanfar et al., 2016). Treatment is one
important strategy for reducing the burden of disease. A study of World Mental Health Surveys
(Organization, 2010) found that only 7.1% of PWSUDs had received at least minimally adequate
treatment in the past year (10.3%, 4.3% and 1.0%, respectively, in high-, upper‐middle, and
low/lower‐middle income countries)(Degenhardt et al., 2017). Poor access to treatment,
awareness/perceived treatment need, and compliance (on the part of both provider and
client) have been reported to be main barriers for substance use treatment (Degenhardt et al.,
2017).
Our results showed that shortage of opioid medication for maintenance treatment was
reported by respondents from about 40% of participating countries. Lack of opioid medications
in patients undergoing maintenance treatment is a risk factor for lapse, relapse and/or
overdoses. This situation may become more severe when transport and other supply chains are
disrupted compounded with reduced provision by pharmacies and other dispensing outlets
either due to spatial distancing, reduced hours of service and/or closing during the pandemic.
RECOMMENDATION 3: International organizations with regional and local government
structures should create contingencies around adequate supplies of medications such as
methadone and buprenorphine. Harm reduction services, especially outreach services, are among
the most effective strategies for prevention of HIV, HCV and HBV transmission among the most at risk

populations (Nazari et al., 2016; Needle et al., 2005; Peak, Rana, Maharjan, Jolley, & Crofts, 1995). Harm
reduction services seem to be among the most affected during the initial stages of the COVID-19
pandemic. Eighty-one (81) % of participating countries reported limitations in usage of any mobile and
other outreach services due to lockdown policies for homeless PWSUDs, with respondents from 57% of
participating countries reporting limitations in their harm reduction overdose services during the initial
period of the pandemic. This was compounded with reported problems with the distribution of takehome naloxone as reported by respondents from 57% of participating countries. Finally, respondents
from 54.8% of participating countries reported that there have been shortages at needle and syringe
programs and/or of condom distribution.

RECOMMENDATION 4: Harm reduction initiatives should be seen as an integral part of an
evidence-based treatment program and not as an adjunct to failed treatment and/or solely as a
public health response to reduce blood-borne diseases. Service providers should be considering
identifying person-centered, continuous care provision in all therapeutic options available
(harm reduction initiatives included) especially during pandemic situations
Pregnant women and immigrants /refugees with SUDs are particularly vulnerable groups.
According to survey responses, pregnant women were perceived as relatively less impacted
during the initial period of the pandemic. This is reassuring as discontinuity of treatment
services could place not only a pregnant woman at high risk, but also the developing fetus.
However, refugee and immigrant populations were reported as having had their services
impacted more than other groups due to the pandemic. Only 12.9% of respondents replied that
service for refugees and/or immigrants population continued as usual, and 57.3% replied that
this service continued but with severe limitations.
RECOMMENDATION 5: Vulnerable groups such as immigrants and refugees with SUDs should
have access to all possible therapeutic options available as described in the UN charter in the
Human Right Convention ("International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families"). It is important that appropriate evidencebased services are designed and implemented by health authorities for such vulnerable groups.

Availability of all relevant resources is essential in the delivery of quality services. Our findings
suggest that in general in multiple domains of countries’ reactions to the pandemic (e.g.,
availability of and access to treatment and harm reduction, screening and early interventions,
flexibility in service provision and services for special and high-risk populations), the COVID-19
pandemic has had more negative impact that is linked to the income level of countries.
This study has multiple limitations. The responses obtained was intentionally based around
personal opinions of addiction medicine experts to help understand the “state of things in real
life” rather than objective epidemiological data which would have been considerably delayed.
The limited number of respondents makes this information non-representative and possibly
biased. Given the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aim of the paper is to alert and
inform colleagues around the world and facilitate collaboration. Due to the time limitations, the
questionnaire was circulated only in English. Therefore, some experts may have withdrawn
from the survey for lingual reasons and others may have answered questions less precisely.
Addiction medicine systems in all countries, regardless of income level, have been affected to
some degree by the COVID-19 pandemic. Depending on the different domains and the ability of
countries to adapt to existing conditions, these effects may differ across jurisdictions. Income
level may relate importantly to responses and impact vulnerable groups like PWSUDs. Our
recommendations will hopefully support a more resilient system of care that improves
responses to future COVID-19 waves and other pandemics.
