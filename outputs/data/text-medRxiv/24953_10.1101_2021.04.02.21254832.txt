Abstract

11

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, global monitoring of the virus using whole genome sequencing

12

has identified mutations occurring across the viral genome. Whilst the majority have little impact on

13

the virus, they are used effectively to monitor the movement of the virus globally and to inform

14

locally on transmission chains.

15

In late 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.7 - VOC 202012/01) was identified in the UK with a

16

distinct constellation of mutations, including in the spike gene that increased transmissibility. A

17

deletion in spike also affected one of the screening qPCR tests being used in the UK outside of

18

Wales, causing a failure to detect the target. This quickly became a surrogate marker for the variant

19

to allow rapid monitoring of the virus as it seeded into new regions of the UK.

20

A screening study using this assay as a proxy marker, was undertaken to understand the prevalence

21

of the variant in Wales. Secondary analysis of a screening qPCR that didn’t target the S gene and also

22

included an endogenous control, was also performed to understand viral load excretion in those

23

infected with the variant compared to other circulating lineages. Using a combination of analytical

24

methods based on the Ct values of two gene targets normalised against the endogenous control,

25

there was a difference in the excreted viral load. Those with the variant excreting more virus than

26

those not infected with the variant. Supporting not only increased infectivity but offering a plausible

27

reason why increased transmission was associated with this particular variant.

28

Whilst there are limitations in this study, the method using Ct as a proxy for viral load can be used at

29

the population level to determine differences in viral excretion kinetics associated with different

30

variants.

Introduction

32

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected within the United

33

Kingdom (UK) in January 2020, with the first confirmed case identified in Wales at the end of

34

February 2020 (Welsh Government, 2020; Lillie et al., 2020). Variants of viruses commonly arise due

35

to mutation in the viral genome, and are mostly identified via whole-genome sequencing (Burki,

36

2021). Mutations and variants are often of little consequence with little effect on the virus or

37

naturally burn-out over time, however can become concerning if the change causes a competitive

38

advantage over the ancestral phenotype (Yurkovetskiy

39

was first identified in the South East of England, and was designated Variant of Concern (VOC)

40

202012/01 in December 2020 (PHE, 2020). Preliminary analysis suggested an approximate growth

41

rate 71% higher than other variants, and reported estimated increase of between 40% and 70% in

42

transmissibility (ECDC, 2020; NERVTAG, 2020).

43

VOC 202012/01 is characterised by an unprecedented number of mutations including an out of

44

frame six nucleotide deletion causing the removal of histidine and valine at positions 69 and 70

45

respectively (∆H69/V70) from the S1 protein subunit (Rambaut et al., 2020; Gloubchik et al., 2021).

46

In total there are eight lineage-defining amino acid changes in Spike, in addition to pre-existing

47

D614G, which are of particular concern due to the antigenicity of the peplomer (Rambaut

48

2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020).

‘Lighthouse laboratories’ provide mass testing for ‘Pillar 2’ of the UK government’s ‘5-pillar plan’ for

50

the upscaling of SARS-CoV-2 testing, whereas the Public Health England and Wales (PHE/PHW) labs

51

and National Health Service (NHS) hospital laboratories cover ‘Pillar 1’ (UK Department of Health and

52

Social care, 2020). In 3 of these Lighthouse laboratories, a phenomenon of S-gene target failure

53

(SGTF) was noticed in Applied Biosystems™ TaqPath™ SARS-CoV-2 qualitative reverse transcriptase

54

polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay (PHE, 2020). SGTF was found to indicate the presence of

55

VOC 202012/01 in samples due to ∆H69/V70, with further study showing that, in samples where

56

both sequence and SGTF status are known, 99.3% of samples with ∆H69/V70 sequences are SGTF;

57

furthermore, 98% of all ∆H69/V70 samples in England were identified as being VOC202012/01 by

58

the beginning of week 50/2020 (PHE, 2020). With this reasoning, the TaqPath™ assay was used as a

59

supplementary test in PHW’s laboratory in University Hospital of Wales (UHW) on samples that had

60

tested positive via other RT-PCR assays from across Wales in order to provide a crude screen for VOC

61

202012/01 in Pillar 1 samples. An incidental observation of such was the ability to compare original

62

cycle threshold (Ct) values of samples with and without SGTF using both Livak and Schmittgen’s ∆∆Ct

63

comparative method (2001), and a relative quantification method in which the ratio of target gene Ct

64

compared to internal control (IC) Ct was calculated. Using SGTF as a crude indicator of the presence

65

of VOC 202012/01 and representing a unique insight into Pillar 1 testing, this analysis sought to

66

determine if there is a statistically significant difference in the relative quantification of virus, and in

67

the relative viral gene expression in VOC 202012/01 vs non-VOC 202012/01 when normalised Ct

68

values obtained by independent means are used as a proxy in lieu of viral loads.

73

Genomics Unit of UHW were to have priority access to samples with Ct≤27 for pre-existing whole-

74

genome sequencing efforts.

75

Samples were largely received as 96-deep-well extraction plates containing extracts with a mix of

76

both positive and negative results. Positive samples were manually picked based on plate maps

77

constructed using RT-qPCR results and stored at 5˚C until further testing. Sample-specific NHS

78

barcodes and episode numbers were utilised for record keeping of processed samples, and to allow

79

for future clinical and epidemiological investigation using the Laboratory Information Management

80

System (LIMS) TrakCare® Lab by InterSystems™ (Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States) used in

81

PHW labs.

82

The TaqPath™ assay was performed on all sample extracts, according to kit instructions, and results

83

were split into 3 qualitative result categories independent of the Ct results obtained through the

84

original diagnostic testing method; ‘Negative’ (RNA not detected by TaqPath but originally reported

85

as positive), ‘SGTF’ and ‘Wild-type (WT)’. These completed results were forwarded to Public Health

86

Wales Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre for analysis to understand the wider epidemiology

87

of SGTF in Wales.

88

To analyse the data further locally, those samples that were tested using the PerkinElmer® (Waltham,

89

Massachusetts, United States) (PE) SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay, were selected due to the use of an

90

endogenous control to normalise Ct values against and because S was not a target, the kinetics of

91

the assay would likely be not affected by absence of amplification or detection in this region.

92

The original PCR Ct values for the PE Nucleocapsid (N) and Open-Reading Frame 1ab (ORF1/ab) gene

93

targets, plus the undisclosed human-originating endogenous internal control (IC), were then

94

recorded for each sample. Together with the corresponding TaqPath™ result, were then split into

95

populations based on the aforementioned categories. Samples with a complete target failure of

96

either N gene or ORF/1ab in the PE assay were then excluded from the final analysis. ∆Ct was then

Livak and Schmittgen’s (2001) ∆∆Ct method was conducted for each target gene; with all calculations

an assumption of ANOVA. In order to perform the ∆∆Ct method, the Ct values for N gene, ORF1/ab

107

and IC for the positive control (PC) reported for every PerkinElmer® plate tested at the UHW PHW

Results

113

In total, 849 samples that tested positive in the PerkinElmer® assay were also tested using the

114

TaqPath™ assay, 65 samples were excluded from the final analyses due to target failure in the PE

115

assay. Of those analysed, 119 were ‘Negative’ according to the TaqPath™ assay, 275 were ‘SGTF’,

116

and 390 were ‘WT’.

117

The mean ∆Ct for ‘SGTF’ samples were lower than ‘WT’ by 3.43 (3s.f.) data points for N gene, and

118

3.78 (3s.f.) for ORF1/ab; and lower than ‘Negative’ samples by 8.28 (3s.f.) and 10.4 (3s.f.) for N gene

120

for ‘SGTF’ samples dwarfing those for ‘WT’ by 5.00 (3s.f.) for N gene, and 4.00 (3s.f.) for ORF1/b; and

those for ‘Negative’ by 10.0 (3s.f.) and 11.0 (3s.f.) for N gene and ORF1/ab, respectively (Table 1).

The distribution of data point values, with statistical significance between groups indicated. QQ

123

normal plots for Ct values compared by both the ∆∆Ct comparative method and relative

124

quantification by ratio proved that both sets of data satisfied the normality (figure 1). Furthermore,

125

all samples were independent with a continuous dependent variable so, assuming equal variance,

126

both datasets were deemed suitable for analysis by one-way ANOVA. Results presented in Fig.1A

127

indicated that there was a statistically significant difference in the log-fold difference relative to the

128

IC Ct between each paired gene target in the ‘SGTF’, ‘WT’ and ‘Negative’ groups (F(3, 781) = 113 3s.f.,

129

p <0.0001).

130

A Tukey post hoc test of multiple comparisons revealed that the relative gene expression in ‘SGTF’

131

samples was higher than in ‘WT’ (1.03 ± 0.401 3s.f.,

132

‘Negative’ (-2.49 ± 0.559 3s.f.,

133

134

relative to IC Ct of gene targets within the same qualitative TaqPath™ group. Similar results were

135

observed when normalising to the IC using ratio data, shown in Fig.1B; whereby one-way ANOVA

136

revealed a statistically significant difference in the relative quantification between each paired gene

137

target in the 3 groups (F(3, 781) = 98.8 3s.f., p <0.0001). A Tukey test showed that the log-fold

difference was higher in ‘SGTF’ samples than in ‘WT’ (-1.03 ± 0.374 3s.f.,

Discussion

145

These results indicate a trend in which viral target gene fold-difference relative to human

146

endogenous IC is higher in samples that result in SGTF than in those that do not. In this analysis,

147

rather than assuming and using the negative correlation between raw Ct values and viral load,

148

normalisation of the target gene to the internal control was taken into account, which builds upon Ct

149

analysis carried out in other studies (Calistri et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2021).

150

When using SGTF as an indicator of VOC 202012/01, and a significantly higher calculated log fold-

151

difference relative to the IC as a proxy for viral load in these samples, the results support other

152

studies that show patients infected with VOC 202012/01 excrete higher viral loads than patients

153

with earlier circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (Kidd et al., 2020; Golubchik et al., 2021). Supporting

154

the suggested increased infectivity and transmissibility reported for this variant.

155

A limitation of this analyses is as this was performed retrospectively, the efficiency of the

156

amplification kinetics of the PE assay was not determined. Because of this, the original iteration of

157

the ∆∆Ct method in which efficiency is assumed to be 100%, was used.

158

Using a single assay and gene target failure to determine the presence or not of a particular variant

159

also has limitations, as despite genomics showing that in regions where the variant might dominate

160

98% or more of the target failure samples are positive for the VOC, the change that leads to the

161

failure may also be sporadic. For example, ∆H69/V70 was reported in some circulating lineages

162

before the emergence of VOC 202012/01, In Wales however, the molecular epidemiology generated

163

by systematic whole genome sequencing in pillar 1 and latterly in pillar 2, largely support the data

164

generated by the proxy assay for the arrival and establishment of VOC 202012/01 across Wales.

165

This study does demonstrate that whilst Ct values generated in a qualitative PCR test can’t be used to

166

firmly determine infectivity, they can be used to indicate changes in viral load excretion patterns
