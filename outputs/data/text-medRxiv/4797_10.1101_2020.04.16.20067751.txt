ABSTRACT
When calculated from aggregate data on confirmed cases and deaths, the case-fatality risk (CFR)
is a simple ratio between the former and the latter, which is prone to numerous biases. With
individual-level data, the CFR can be estimated as a true measure of risk as the proportion of
incidence for the disease. We present the first estimates of the CFR for COVID-19 by age and
sex based on event history modelling of the risk of dying among confirmed positive individuals
in the Canadian province of Ontario, which maintains one of the few individual-level datasets on
COVID-19 in the world.

INTRODUCTION
The severity profile of a novel pathogen is one of the most critical issues as it begins to spread,
when assessing disease course and outcome is crucial for planning health interventions (1). For
this reason, an important epidemiological indicator to monitor during the current outbreak of
COVID-19 is the case-fatality risk (CFR), the proportion of confirmed cases who result in
fatalities. When calculated from aggregate data on confirmed cases and deaths, the CFR is a
simple ratio between the former and the latter, which is prone to numerous biases (1-5). With
individual-level data, the CFR can be estimated as a true measure of risk as the proportion of
incidence for the disease.
There are only two accessible individual-level datasets on COVID-19 confirmed positive cases
that include their clinical outcome (death or recovery), which are maintained by the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and Alberta1. Ontario is currently the second province in Canada for
number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. We present the first estimates of the CFR for
COVID-19 by age and sex based on event history modelling of the risk of dying among
confirmed positive individuals in Ontario.2

METHODS
Between January 1 and April 15, 2020, Ontario recorded 8,447 confirmed positive cases of
COVID-19, of which 3,902 had recovered and 385 had died. The individual-level dataset we
analyse contains basic information on age, gender, clinical outcome (death or recovery) and
name of the reporting health facility for these cases. Individuals’ age is recorded at the time of

The number of COVID-19-related deaths recorded in Alberta (48 as of April 15) is too small for this type of
analysis.

testing in ten-years groups, with information missing for 5 cases (of which 2 are recoveries and 3
have an unresolved outcome). Information on gender is missing for 46 cases (of which 5 are
fatalities, 12 are recoveries, and 29 have an unresolved outcome). These observations were
excluded, so that the analysis is based on 8,394 cases, of whom 56.2% (4,716) are females.
Following the guidelines of the World Health Organization, in Canada only individuals
symptomatic with fever, cough and/or difficulty breathing are tested for COVID-19. In Ontario,
case definition refers to these symptomatic individuals who tested positive for the virus and also
to their close contacts even if they were not tested for the disease. In our dataset, this latter
category included 1,429 (17%) of cases.
We estimate the CFR through event history modelling in order to take into account censoring
that arises because, at the time of observation, the outcome is unknown for a nonnegligible
portion of infected individuals. In this framework, the CFR coincides with the cumulative
incidence (CI) of mortality, with recovery as a competing risk. The CI is estimated after fitting
the competing risk regression model, controlling for gender, with stcrreg in Stata/SE (version
12.0, StataCorp, LLC).

RESULTS
Of 8,394 confirmed positive cases considered, 191 (2.3%) were under 20 years age; 946 (11.3%)
age 20-29; 1,045 (12.5%) age 30-39; 1,241 (14.8%) age 40-49; 1,545 (18.4%) age 50-59; 1,188
(14.2%) age 60-69; 794 (9.5%) age 70-79; 873 (10.4%) age 80-89; and 571 (6.8%) age 90 or
more.
The CFR (cumulative incidence of mortality vs recovery) for COVID-19 confirmed positive
cases in Ontario is presented in Table 1. It can be seen that it increases exponentially with age,

reaching 18.7% for those aged 90+. By comparing the estimated cumulative incidence of death
for COVID-19 with the crude case-fatality risk calculated from aggregate data on the total
number of cases and deaths, we can appreciate to what extent the latter over-estimates the risk of
COVID-19-related mortality in each age group. This is especially the case in the 70-79 and 8089 age groups, when the difference between the two estimates is 6.2% and 5.0%, respectively.

Cumulative incidence is estimated controlling for patients’ gender.

At any age, female positive cases have a risk of mortality that is 29 percent lower than male
cases (SHR=.706; CI=.581, .858 ; p=.000). The comparison of the cumulative incidence of
COVID-19-related mortality for males and females is presented in Figure 1.

CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that the CFR for COVID-19 can be more accurately estimated with individuallevel data. This is important not only to understand the evolution of the pandemic, but also to
evaluate the effectiveness of new treatments as they are introduced. Information on patients’
medical history would improve the analysis by discounting the effect of pre-existing conditions
on the risk of mortality for COVID-19. Utilization of health care resources could be also
assessed with information on hospitalizations and on the time elapsed between diagnosis and
clinical outcome. As we and several scholars indicated (6-7), the lack of comparable data and
indicators is hampering our efforts to win the war against COVID-19. National and global
coordination in this area is urgently needed.
