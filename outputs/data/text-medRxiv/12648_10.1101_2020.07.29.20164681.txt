ABSTRACT

45

Knowledge of the dynamic immunological characteristics of patients with coronavirus

46

disease 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for clinicians to understand the progression of

47

the disease. Our data showed that the immune system and function gradually

48

remodeled and declined with age, starting from age 16 until age 91 in 25,239 healthy

49

controls. An analysis of the relationship between the number of lymphocytes and age

50

revealed that the lymphocyte and subset counts tended to decline with age

51

significantly.

52

(SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunity declined with age and was associated with survival

53

time in fatal cases. Loss in the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity could be

54

expanded in vitro. The concurrent decline in SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and

55

humoral immunities and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure predicted fatal outcomes.

56

Our findings provide a basis for further analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity

57

and understanding of the pathogenesis of fatal COVID-19 cases.

INTRODUCTION

67

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic leads to severe illness, life-threatening

68

complications, and death, especially in high-risk groups such as elderly people and individuals

69

with comorbidities1-7. However, information on immunological characteristics in the assessment

70

of COVID-19 for frontline clinicians is limited. The objective of this study is to explore the

71

dynamic immunological characteristics as the disease progresses.

72

In January, 2020, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was

73

identified in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients in Wuhan, China, and was

74

confirmed as the cause of the SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia1,2. Full-genome sequencing and

75

phylogenic analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade from the betacoronaviruses

76

associated with human SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)1,2.

77
78

COVID-19 has spread rapidly since it was first identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have a

79

wide spectrum of severity. Recently, a report shows that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shared the

80

same functional host-cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)8. Furthermore,

81

SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors in 10-20 fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV binds to the

82

same receptors8. The receptor binding domain is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain

83

of ACE2 mainly through polar residues, which provide important insights into the molecular basis

84

for coronavirus recognition and infection9. Since ACE2 receptors on lung alveolar epithelial cells

85

and enterocytes of the small intestine are highly expressed, lung alveolar epithelial cells or

86

enterocytes of the small intestine may be an important source of infection10.

87

According to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance on January 12, 2020,

88

SARS-CoV-2 infection is classified as asymptomatic, mild, severe, and critical cases of

89

pneumonia (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], sepsis, septic shock). Severe cases of

90

pneumonia are defined as patients with respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, severe respiratory

91

distress, or peripheral capillary oxygen saturation < 90% on room air11. Asymptomatic cases have

92

been reported in China and Germany12,13. Huang et al.2 first reported 41 cases of SARS-CoV-2

93

pneumonia in which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale

94

Market. Organ dysfunction (shock, ARDS, acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury, etc.) and

95

death can occur in severe or critical cases. Guan et al.3 reported findings from 1,099 cases of

96

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the results suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 infection clustered

97

within groups of people in close contact, and was more likely to affect the old with comorbidities.

98

However, there is no pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the population

99

level, leading to more than half million deaths and 10 millions of infections which have been

100

reported worldwide as of June 29, 202014.

101

The disease severity is associated with immune dysregulation, for example, dysregulation of T

102

cells, or associated with macrophage activation syndrome15-21. Grifoni et al.22 reported

103

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells responses in 20 recovery cases of COVID-19. Using

104

multiple experimental approaches, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell and antibody responses were

105

observed in all COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cell responses were seen in

106

most COVID-19 patients. All of the patients had SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells that

107

recognized the virus’s spike protein, and 70% of them had SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T cells that

108

responded to the same protein. The identification of strong T cell responses in recovered

109

COVID-19 patients promotes further study in designing vaccines to induce T cell responses. Ni et

110

al.18 also observed SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in 14 convalescent

111

patients. However, to the best of our knowledge, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell

112

responses in fatal cases of COVID-19 were not reported. Furthermore, understanding the key

113

immune mechanisms to recover from novel SARS-CoV-2 exposure is an urgent need.

114

It is important to understand the key risk factors of critical patients who died. We hypothesize that

115

lethal COVID-19 disease would be associated with immune dysregulation and loss expansion of

116

SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. Here, we analyzed dynamic immunological characteristics in

117

fatal COVID-19 patients in a unique longitudinal cohort of samples.

118

RESULTS

119
120

The immune system and function gradually remodeled and declined with age in

121

25,239 healthy controls.

122

The numbers of lymphocytes and subset counts, except for natural killer (NK) cells,

123

tended to decline with age significantly (Spearman R = – [range, 0.9048–1], P < 0.001,

124

Figure 1A–E and Table S2). However, the relationship between the number of NK

125

cells and age only showed a tendency of the NK cells to increase in number with age

126

(Spearman R = 0.6429, P = 0.0962, Figure 1F and Table S2).

127
128

SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity declined with age in fatal COVID-19 cases

129

The SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity tended to decline with age (Figure 2A–C).

130

However, the virus load tended to increase with age (Figure 2D).

131

The ability to expand SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon gamma (IFNγ)+CD4+ T cells

132

(Spearman R = −0.8020, P< 0.0001, Figure 2A) and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells (Spearman R

133

= −0.8028, P< 0.0001, Figure 2B) was significantly inversely related to age. This

134

suggests that the elderly had low expansion ability of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell

135

immunity, which led to the faster progression of the disease to a severe illness, an

136

important risk factor of mortality in the elderly. SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral

137

immunity (Spearman R = −0.2671, P = 0.0254, Figure 2C) was also inversely related

138

to age. However, this relationship was weaker than that of SARS-CoV-2-specific

139

T-cell immunity with age. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was directly and significantly

140

proportional to age (Spearman R = 0.4780, P< 0.0001, Figure 2D). This suggests that

141

the elderly easily contracted the infection or that the patients had a higher viral load in

142

the body.

143

SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity is associated with survival time in fatal

144

COVID-19 cases

145

As the survival time increased, the SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity tended to increase.

146

However, the relationship between virus load and survival time showed that the virus

147

load tended to decrease as the survival time increased (Figure 3).

148
149

The correlations between SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T cells (Spearman R =

150

0.7655, P< 0.0001, Figure 3A) and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells (Spearman R = 0.7623, P<

151

0.0001, Figure 3B) and survival time were relatively strong and significant,

152

suggesting that the patient’s survival time depended on the expansion ability of

153

SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity. The aggregated data for 4 weeks showed that

154

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity was significantly related to survival time

155

(Spearman R = 0.7924, P< 0.0001, Figure 3C). The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was

156

inversely proportional to survival time (Spearman R = −0.4730, P< 0.0001, Figure

157

3D). This suggests that the higher the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the shorter the

158

survival time of the patient. Therefore, controlling the replication of the virus might

159

prolong the survival time of patients.

160
161

We found no significant difference in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific

162

IFNγ+CD4+ T cells (Figure 4A) between the first and second weeks. However,

163

significant differences were observed between the first and third or fourth weeks,

164

possibly indicating that SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T cells began to expand in

165

the third week significantly (Figure 4A). No significant difference in the frequency of

166

SARS-CoV-2 specific IFNγ+CD8+ T cells was found between the first and second,

167

third, or fourth weeks, indicating that the expansion of the specific CD8 T cells was

168

lost (Figure 4B). A significant difference in the titer of the specific IgG antibodies was

169

found between the first and second weeks. Compared with that at week 1, the IgG

170

titer in weeks 2–4 continued to show significant differences, which suggests that the

171

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies began to expand in the second week, but the

172

antibody titer was low (Figure 4C). Significant differences were found between the

173

viral loads from weeks 1 to 4 (Figure 4D), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2-specific

174

immunity could potentially clear the SARS-CoV-2 replication in fatal cases. However,

175

the SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity was unable to clear all SARS-CoV-2 replications

176

in the fatal cases. The mean viral load was 6.7  104 copies/mL at week 3, indicating

177

the presence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

178
179

The loss in the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in the fatal cases

180

could be expanded in vitro

181

From our results, we can infer that the key factor was loss in the expansion of

182

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunities, causing the virus to remain in

183

the body in fatal cases. As the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity started

184

from the first 2–3 weeks, we chose peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) in

185

the third week for the expansion experiment in vitro. Our data showed that these

186

PBMCs could be expanded in vitro. After the expansion, SARS-CoV-2-specific

187

IFNγ+CD4+ T cells and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells increased significantly (Figure 5). This

188

suggests that the SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity lost its expansion in the 21 fatal

189

cases at week 3, but the expansion of the SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity

190

was recovered in the in vitro experiment (Figure 5).

191
192

A concurrent decline in SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immunities

193

and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure predicted fatal outcomes

195

Significant correlations were observed between SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T

196

cells (Spearman R = 0.4537, P< 0.0001, Figure 6A) and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells

197

(Spearman R = 0.3721, P = 0.0002, Figure 6B) and SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral

immunity.

199
200

SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T cells (Spearman R = −0.4784, P< 0.0001,

201

Figure 7A) and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells (Spearman R = −0.4609, P< 0.0001, Figure 7B)

202

inversely correlated significantly with the SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which suggests

203

that the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity plays a leading role in viral clearance.

204
205

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity inversely correlated significantly with

206

SARS-CoV-2 viral load, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral

immunity played a role in viral clearance (Figure 8). However, the R value of

However, the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was

217

(Figure 9C), which suggests a loss in the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral

218

immunity in the fatal cases. Here, we define "loss in the expansion" as a decrease in

219

SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in fatal cases compared to survivors of critical

220

COVID-19 cases.

221
222

Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity was unable to clear the SARS-CoV-2

223

replications in the fatal cases. All the patients had a positive viral load before death,

224

which suggests that prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure can predict fatal outcomes

225

(Figure 4D).

226
227

DISCUSSION

228
229

The extent of lymphopenia in patients admitted to the intensive care unit correlates

230

with COVID-19 severity and mortality23-26. Therefore, studies of the immune system

231

and function in healthy controls are important to understand whether the immune

232

system and function is related to age. Our data showed that the immune system and

233

function have gradually remodeled and declined with age in 25,239 healthy controls.

234

Channappanavar et al.27 reported that SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells

235

persisted for up to 6 years after SARS-CoV infection. When challenge with a lethal

236

dose of SARS-CoV, virus-specific memory CD8 T cells efficiently produced IFNγ,

237

tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), etc. and reduced lung viral load. Next, we tried to

238

understand whether SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity is associated with age in those

239

fatal patients with COVID-19. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2-specific

240

immunity has declined with age in COVID-19 patients.

241

Levels of lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets are of great importance to keep the

242

immune system working. Usually viral infection, immunodeficiency diseases, and

243

other infectious diseases lead to abnormal changes in the levels of lymphocyte

244

subsets16. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causative agent of

245

COVID-19, the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 impacts the human immune

246

system is still unclear16.

247

Grifoni et al.22 reported SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells responses in 20

248

recovery cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell and antibody

249

responses were observed in all COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 T

250

cell responses were seen in most COVID-19 patients. Ni et al.18 also observed

251

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in 14 convalescent patients. We

252

explored whether SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity is associated with survival time in

253

those fatal patients with COVID-19. Our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 specific

254

immunity was associated with survival time in COVID-19 patients. Our results were

255

consistent with previous reports18,22.

256
257

From the above results, it can be known that the key factor was loss in the expansion

258

of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity and the virus cannot be

259

eliminated from the body in fatal cases. We tried to understand whether loss in the

12

260

expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity in fatal cases could be expanded in

261

vitro. Since the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity started from the first

262

2-3 weeks, we chose PMBCs in the third week for the expansion experiment in vitro.

263

Our data showed that these PBMCs could be expanded in vitro. After the expansion,

264

SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T cells and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells increased

265

significantly. It suggested that the SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity of these fatal

266

patients lost their expansion, but the expansion of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular

267

immunity could be recovered in vitro experiment.

268
269

Our data indicated that a concurrent decline in SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and

270

humoral immunity and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure predicted fatal outcomes.

271

First, the immune system and function have gradually remodeled and declined with

272

age in healthy controls. Therefore, the elderly are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2.

273

Second, our data showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity has declined with age

274

in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the elderly easily turned from mild to severe

275

SARS-CoV-2 infections. Those results have explained that the elderly is a risk factor

276

for poor outcomes. Third, our data further showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific

277

immunity is associated with survival time in COVID-19 patients. The correlation

278

between SARS-CoV-2-specific IFNγ+CD4+ T cells and IFNγ+CD8+ T cells and

279

survival time was relatively strong, and significantly correlated with survival time,

280

suggesting that patient survival time depended on the expansion ability of

281

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. The aggregated data for 4 weeks showed that

282

SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity was related to survival time. SARS-CoV-2

283

viral load was inversely proportional to survival time significantly. It suggested that

284

the higher the viral load of SARS-CoV-2, the shorter the survival time of patients.

285

Therefore, controlling the replication of the virus might prolong the survival time of

286

patients. Finally, we observed that a concurrent decline in SARS-CoV-2-specific

287

cellular and humoral immunity and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 exposure predicted fatal

288

outcomes. There was significant correlation between SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell

289

immunity and SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity. The frequency of

290

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and titer of IgG were much lower than that of survivors

291

of critical COVID-19 cases and there were higher viral load in the course of the

292

disease, indicating that the persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and loss in the expansion

293

of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity are important factors.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

490

Study Design and Participants

491

This retrospective study was conducted at Chinese PLA General Hospital, Peking Union Medical

492

College Hospital, the First Affiliated Hospital, and affiliated hospitals of Shanghai University of

493

Medicine and Health Sciences. Chinese PLA General Hospital and Peking Union Medical College

494

Hospital are the largest clinical research hospitals in China. Demographic characteristics of 35

495

fatal patients with COVID-19 on admission were listed in Table S1. The 18 critical cases (matched

496

by age and sex) who survived were enrolled for comparison. This case series was approved by the

497

institutional ethics board of Chinese PLA General Hospital (#2020-111), Peking Union Medical

498

College Hospital (#ZS-1830), The First Affiliated Hospital (#KY2020046), and Shanghai

499

University of Medicine and Health Sciences (#2019-LCHZ-18-20190507). Written informed

500

consent was obtained from healthy controls and waived to COVID-19 patients due to the rapid

501

emergence of this infectious disease. Identification of hypertensive patients was achieved by

502

reviewing and analyzing available electronic medical records and patient care resources. Clinical

503

outcomes (discharge, mortality, and recovery, etc.) were monitored and all clinical recovery

504

hypertensive patients meet the following criteria: body temperature returned to normal for more

505

than 3 days, respiratory symptoms improved significantly, and lung imaging showed significant

506

improvement.

507
508

METHOD DETAILS

509

Cell preparation

510

Whole blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 1800 rpm to separate the cellular fraction and plasma.

511

The plasma was then carefully removed from the cell pellet and stored at -20°C. Peripheral blood

512

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS density gradients (GE

513

Healthcare Life Sciences, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolated PBMCs

514

were either studied directly or cryopreserved in cell recovery media containing 10% DMSO

515

(Gibco, USA), supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum and stored in liquid

516

nitrogen until used in the assays. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed by diluting them in 10 mL

517

complete RPMI 1640 with 5% human AB serum (Gemini Bioproducts, USA) in the presence of

518

benzonase (final concentration at 50 U/mL) before an experiment.

519

SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein peptide pools

520

SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein peptide pools (SPs) were from Genscript Biotech, USA. SPs

521

include 316 peptides (delivered in two subpools of 158 peptides) derived from a peptide scan (15

522

mers with 11 amino acid overlap) through the entire Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.

523

Expansion of PBMCs in vitro

524

20% of PBMCs were pulsed with 10 μg/mL of the SPs for 1 hour at 37 °C, subsequently washed,

525

and cocultured with the remaining cells in AIM-V medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific,

526

USA) supplemented with 2% AB human serum (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). PBMCs

527

were cultured for 7 days in the presence of 20 U/mL of recombinant IL-2 (R&D Systems, USA).

528

Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay

529

PBMCs were first stimulated with or without SPs (2 μg /mL) for 3 h at 37°C, then brefeldin A (10

530

μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to cultures to enable intracellular proteins to accumulate

531

in all stimulations. PBMCs were stimulated RPMI medium containing 10% FCS as a negative

532

control. After incubation for a total of 6 h, the cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized using

533

fixation/permeablization solution kit (BD Biosciences, USA) and blocked with FcR blocking

534

reagent (Meltenyi Biotec, USA) for 30 min at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding of antibodies to

535

human Fc receptor. The cells were then stained with anti-IFNγ antibodies (BD Bioscience, USA)

536

for 30 min at 4 °C. After staining, all samples were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline

537

(PBS) containing 0.1 % saponin, 0.1 % BSA and 0.05 % NaN3 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and

538

resuspended in 300 μL PBS for measurement in a flow cytometer (FACSVerse™ flow cytometry,

539

BD Bioscience, USA).

540

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2

541

Throat, sputum and blood samples were collected for extracting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from

542

hypertensive patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection. In brief, RNA was extracted

543

within 2 h using the total RNA isolation kit. Cell lysates (250 μL) were transferred into a

544

collection tube followed by vortex for 10 s. After standing at room temperature for 10 min, the

545

collection tube was centrifugated at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The suspension was used for RT-PCR

546

assay of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two target genes, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and

547

nucleocapsid protein (N), were simultaneously amplified and tested during the RT-PCR assay.

548

The sequences of primers and probes were: Target 1 (ORF1ab): forward primer

549

CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; and the probe

550

5′-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3′. Target 2 (N): forward primer

551

GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; and

552

the probe 5′-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3′. The RT-PCR assay was

553

performed using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kit. Reaction mixture contained 12 μL of

554

reaction buffer, 4 μL of enzyme solution, 4 μL of probe primer solution, 3 μL of diethyl

pyrocarbonate–treated water, and 2 μL of RNA template. The RT-PCR assay was performed

556

under the following conditions: incubation at 50 °C for 15 min and 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of

557

denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, and extending and collecting fluorescence signal at 55 °C for 45 s.

558

A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and a Ct-value

559

of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on the

560

recommendation by the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China).

561

Samples with a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40 was confirmation by retesting. The copies of RNA

562

per reaction were obtained from the standard curve of limiting-dilution series of standard copies of

563

RNA versus PCR amplification cycle.

564

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of immunoglobulin (Ig)

565

Antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG) specific to SARS-CoV-2 were determined with two different

566

ELISA: an in-house assay using SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) protein (Cat.

567

#Z03479, Genscript Biotech, USA) as an antigen, or a commercial kit (SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD

568

ELISA Kit, Cat. #40591-V08H, Sino Biological, China). Microtiter plates were coated with 50

569

ng/well of target protein overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then blocked for 2 h at 37 °C using 200 μL

570

of 5% non-fat milk in PBS. Serum samples were then diluted into 1:50 using PBS and 100 μL of

571

each sample was applied to coated ELISA plate and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Plates were then

572

washed with PBS and incubated with HRP-labeled anti-human IgM, IgA, and IgG (Sigma Aldrich,

573

USA), which were diluted to 1:2000 in 5% non-fat milk in PBS. After incubation for another 1 h

574

at room temperature, the plates were washed and developed with TMB/E substrate (Millipore,

575

USA). Finally, the reaction was stopped with 1 M H2SO4, and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm

576

was measured. Negative serum control was run each time when the assay was performed. A

sample is positive if its adjusted OD value (OD of test – OD of control) exceeds the mean plus 3

578

standard deviations of the normal controls.

Flow cytometry analysis

580

All samples were analyzed by FACSVerse™ flow cytometry (BD Bioscience, USA). Two blood

581

samples in two tubes (100 μL each) were stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

582

Then, red-cell lysis buffer (1 mL) was added to each tube, the samples were incubated for 10 min

583

and washed with Sorvall cell washer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Cells were blocked with

584

FcR blocking reagent (Meltenyi Biotec, USA) for 30 min at 4 °C to reduce nonspecific binding of

585

antibodies to human Fc receptor and washed with PBS. The cells were then stained with

586

antibodies as listed in Figure and the fixable dead cell stain kit (Invitrogen, USA) for 30 min at

587

4 °C and were then resuspended in 350 μL PBS and analyzed in flow cytometry (FACSVerse™

588

flow cytometry, BD Bioscience, USA). Calibration and quality control for the instrument were

589

carried out daily with the use of eight-color setup beads (BD Bioscience). All specimens were

590

analyzed in duplicates with coefficient of variation (CV) < 5% by two independent technicians

591

under the inter-laboratory quality control. The experiments were repeated if the results showed

592

CV > 5% according to the instructions of BD Bioscience. The data were analyzed by FlowJo

593

software (version 10, Tree Star, USA).

594

Statistical analysis

595

Categorical variables were described as frequency rates and percentages, and continuous variables

596

were described using mean and median values. Means for continuous variables were compared

597

using independent group t tests when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the

598

Mann-Whitney test was used. Data (non-normal distribution) from repeated measures were

compared using the generalized linear mixed model. Proportions for categorical variables were

600

compared using the χ2 test, although the Fisher’s exact test was used when the data were limited.

601

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences

602

Inc., version 13.0). For unadjusted comparisons, a two-sided P value less than 0.05 was

603

considered statistically significant. The analyses have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons

604

and, given the potential for type I error, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory and

605

descriptive. Because the cohort of patients in our study was not derived from random selection, all

606

statistics are deemed to be descriptive only.
