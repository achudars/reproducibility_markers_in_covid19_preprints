Abstract
Background. Although evidence is accumulating that climate conditions may positively
or negatively influence the scale of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks,
uncertainty remains concerning the real impact of climate factors on viral transmission.
Methods. The number of new daily cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Verona (Italy) was
retrieved from the official website of Veneto Region, while information on daily
weather parameters in the same area was downloaded from IlMeteo website, a
renowned Italian technological company specialized in weather forecasts. The search
period ranged between March 1 to November 11, 2020. The number of new daily
COVID-19 cases and meteorological data in Verona were correlated using both
univariate and multivariate analysis.
Results. The number of daily COVID-19 diagnoses in Verona was positively associated
with the number of days in lockdown and humidity, and inversely correlated with mean,
min and max temperature, mean wind speed and number of days with rainfall. Days of
lockdown, mean air temperature, humidity, mean wind speed and number of days with
rainfall remained significantly associated in multivariate analysis. The four weather
parameters contributed to explaining 61% of variance in new daily COVID-19
diagnoses. Each 1% increase in air temperature, 1% decrease in humidity, 1 km/h
increase in wind speed and day with rainfall were independently associated with 1.0%,
0.3%, 1.2% and 5.4% reduction in new COVID-19 daily diagnoses. A significant
difference was observed in values of all-weather parameters recorded in Verona
between days with <100 or ≥100 new daily COVID-19diagnoses.
Conclusions. Climate conditions may play an essential role in conditions of viral
transmission, and influence the likelihood or course of local outbreaks. Preventive
measures, testing policies and hospital preparedness should be reinforced during periods

Introduction
It has now become clear that inter-human transmission of severe acute respiratory
distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is primarily through virus-containing
droplets, emitted from nose or mouth, especially when infected persons exhale large
volumes of air (e.g., coughing, sneezing, shouting, singing or exercising) (1).
Transmission is also possible via aerosol-generating activities, especially with
prolonged exposure to infected subjects within enclosed and poorly ventilated spaces
(1). It should also be noted that droplets emitted from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects
and containing the virus can land on surfaces and objects in such a manner that the virus
can remain viable and transmittable for hours, mostly via involuntarily or unconscious
transport of the infected material to nose, mouth or eyes.
Based on these preferential means of viral transmission, a vast array of measures
have been adopted to limit the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These
encompass early diagnosis of potentially infective cases (2), hand hygiene, ambient
sanitization, widespread use of facial masks, as well as social distancing or isolation (3,
4). Identifying additional determinants that may influence (i.e., either boost or limit)
viral transmission within the community is essential, as this would enable to plan
specific interventions against high-risk conditions. With respect to patient
characteristics, the risk of being severely infected seems higher in people aged ≥40
years, in males, in blacks, in those overweight or co-morbidities (5). Specific activities
and environmental aspects are also important factors in community transmission,
including meeting, traveling or dining with infected individuals, especially without
wearing face masks, being a family member of infected patients (6), and remaining for
long periods in close proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects who are not wearing a
face mask in crowded and poorly ventilated environments (7). A large recent study,
which investigated the behavioral patterns of as many as 98 million Americans with

respect to the risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2, identified locations by which
transmission risk was most likely to occur (8). The study identified fitness centers, café
and snack bars, hotels and motels, religious organizations, physicians’ offices, grocery,
merchandise, sporting goods and pet stores as common sites of transmission.
Recent evidence has also suggested that weather conditions may positively or
negatively contribute to the scale of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks (9, 10). However, since
uncertainty remains concerning the real impact of some climate factors on the onset
and/or spread of local clusters or outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 (11), we designed a
retrospective study in which we correlated daily weather parameters recorded in Verona
(Italy) with the number of new official diagnoses of COVID-19 within the same
geographical location, since the beginning of the local outbreak in March 2020.

Materials and Methods
To specifically address the impact of weather on COVID-19 spread, we retrieved
official data on the number of new daily cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Verona
(Italy) from the official website of the Veneto Region, whilst information on daily
weather parameters in the same region was downloaded from the IlMeteo website
(https://www.ilmeteo.it/portale/archivio-meteo/Verona), a renewed Italian technological
company specialized in provision of services and communication on weather forecasts.
The search period ranged between the date of the first COVID-19 case diagnosed in
Verona (i.e., March 1, 2020) and November 11, 2020. The number of new daily
COVID-19 cases and meteorological data in Verona were imported into a Microsoft
Excel file (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, United States). The correlation between the
number of new daily COVID-19 diagnoses, the days of lockdown in the area (i.e.,
between March 9 and May 18, 2020) and climate parameters were analyzed using
univariate (Spearman’s correlation) and multivariate (multiple linear regression after

logarithmic data transformation) analyses. In this latter case, the number of new
COVID-19 daily cases was set as dependent variable, while climate data found to be
significantly associated in univariate analysis, were set as independent variables. The
difference in values of weather parameters recorded in Verona between days with <100
or ≥100 new daily diagnoses of COVID-19 in the same region was assessed with MannWhitney U or chi-squared (χ2) tests, as appropriate. All continuous variables were
reported as mean and standard deviation (SD). The statistical analysis was carried out
using Analyse-it (Analyse-it Software Ltd, Leeds, UK). The study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, under the terms of relevant local
legislation. This retrospective analysis was based on searches of unrestricted, publicly
available databases, and thereby no informed consent or Ethical Committee approvals
were required.

Results
The results of our analysis are shown in Table 1. A significant association was found
in univariate analysis between the daily number of new COVID-19 diagnoses in
Verona, days of lockdown and all the weather parameters investigated (i.e., mean
temperature, min temperature, max temperature, humidity, mean wind speed, and
number of days with rainfall). More specifically, the number of new daily COVID-19
diagnoses in Verona was found to be positively associated with the number of days in
lockdown and humidity, while it was inversely correlated with mean, min and max
temperature, mean wind speed and number of days with rainfall. In multivariate
analysis, days of lockdown, mean air temperature, humidity, mean wind speed and
number of days with rainfall remained significantly associated with new daily COVID19 cases (Table 1). Overall, these four weather parameters contributed to explaining
61% of the variance in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases. More specifically,

each 1% increase in air temperature, 1% decrease in humidity, 1 km/h increase in wind
speed and day with rainfall were independently associated with a 1.0%, 0.3%, 1.2% and
5.4% reduction in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases, respectively. Notably, a
significant difference was also observed in values of all-weather parameters recorded in
Verona between days with <100 or ≥100 new daily COVID-19 diagnoses, as shown in
Table 2.

and

environments (12). To provide further insights on this critical issue, we carried out a
retrospective study, arbitrarily limited to Verona (Italy), for increasing the accuracy of
climate measures and the strength of their potential associations with COVID-19
epidemics. In this way, it is more likely that the weather parameters recorded in the area
of Verona, which extends over 3,096 km² and has a population of nearly 930,000
inhabitants, would help to more accurately discern the interplay with virus transmission
compared to studies based on larger metropolitan areas, bigger districts, regions or even
on entire nations or continents, where climate condition may be considerably different
from one location and another.
Taken together, the results of our analysis reveal that the new daily COVID-19
diagnoses in Verona were positively associated with local humidity, while an inverse
correlation was noted with mean, min and max temperature, mean wind speed and
number of rainy days. Therefore, although each of these weather parameters that we
have investigated seem to produce a direct effect on interpersonal SARS-CoV-2 spread,
the cumulative number of daily contagions appears to be more dependent on mean air
temperature, humidity, mean wind speed and rain, which altogether would contribute to

explain over 60% of total variance in the number of new daily COVID-19 diagnoses in
Verona (Table 2).
In a recent meta-regression of data garnered from 33 large US cities (i.e., with over
500,000 inhabitants), Takagi et al. concluded that the actual prevalence of COVID-19
was inversely associated with UV index, sun hours and outdoor temperature (13), whilst
a positive association was found with mean wind speed. These findings are hence
aligned with our results. In a separate investigation, Shi et al. explored the potential
relationship between daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and mean outdoor
temperatures in 31 regions in mainland China (14). Overall, a significant inverse
association could be found between air temperature and COVID-19 incidence
(Coefficient = -0.01). Liu et al. also carried out a study of 30 provincial capital cities in
China (15), concluding that meteorology may play an important role in the spread of
COVID-19. More specifically, each 1 °C increase in outdoor temperature and diurnal
temperature range was associated with 20% and 10% reduction in the number of daily
diagnoses of COVID-19, respectively. Unlike these findings, a recent study published
by Su et al. based on analysis of variation of effective reproductive number (Rt) among
277 worldwide regions, concluded that outdoor temperature is modestly associated with
transmission rate, accounting for only 2.7% variation per 1 °C (16). Although this
evidence persuaded the authors to conclude that warm temperatures are highly unlikely
to prevent the natural spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the population, this conclusion,
based only on temperature, seems inappropriate since warmer seasons are characterized
by several climate changes (e.g., humidity, rainfall and so forth), which may all
contribute to influence SARS-CoV-2 interpersonal spread.
The low risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 with increasing mean outdoor
temperature values has at least three substantial explanations. First, temperate likely
directly affects social distancing, since people are more inveigled to spend time outdoor,

thus reducing the higher risk attributable to indoor viral transmission (17). Second,
longer sunlight exposure and higher outdoor temperature have also been associated with
greater extent of viral inactivation (18, 19). Finally, reliable evidence has been provided
that virus-containing droplets could travel 3-fold slower in higher temperature
environments (20), thus consistently mitigating their air propagation and infective
potential.
Background airspeed seems to be another important determinant of infectious disease
transmission. Although it is quite understandable that viral-containing aerosols and
droplets may propagate over longer distances as the airflow speed increases, it has also
been demonstrated that higher air velocity may effectively dilute the number of
infectious viral-containing particles (7, 20). In keeping with this theory, a decreased
wind speed has been inversely associated with the number of COVID-19 cases in five
major Saudi Arabian cities (21). Since the risk of being infected and developing severe
COVID-19 illness is directly dependent on the volume of viral inoculum (22), it is
predictable that a lower risk of viral transmission would occur in environments with
higher air currents and/or enhanced ventilation (23).
We also found an interesting association between days with rainfall and emergence
of new COVID-19 cases in the area of Verona. The likelihood of diagnosing more
SARS-CoV-2 cases seemed to be greater during days without precipitations. A similar
association was reported in a recent study carried out by Chien and Chen in the top 50
US counties (24). These authors concluded that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection may
considerably decline when the volume of yearly precipitation increases to over 450 cm.
The mechanisms underneath this intriguing association between rainfall and lower risk
of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear at this point. We proffer that precipitations
may reduce viral transmission by enhancing the fall of droplets and aerosol to the
ground, thus limiting their airborne propagation. The drops of rain could also be

effective in diluting, cleaning, or even completely washing away viable viral particles
from infected outdoor surfaces, thus contributing to a lower risk of contagion contact.
Finally, concerning humidity, Zhao et al. recently showed that air transmission of
virus-containing droplets is directly associated with humidity, increasing almost in
parallel with the extent of environment humidity (20). Interestingly, these same authors
concluded that the current 1 to 2 meters social distance standards might be insufficient
in many ambient conditions, because droplets may travel far beyond such distances in
extremely humid and cold environments.

Conclusions
Although we could not directly evaluate the potential impact of the total number
of daily molecular tests on the rate of new COVID-19 diagnoses in Verona, the
evidence garnered from our analysis of meteorological data throughout the current
SARS-CoV-2 local outbreak suggests that climate conditions may play an important
role in modulating the conditions of viral transmission, thus influencing the likelihood
or course of local infective clusters. Public health policies, preventive measures, testing
strategies and hospital preparedness should be reinforced during periods of higher
meteorological risk and in local environments with adverse climate conditions.
