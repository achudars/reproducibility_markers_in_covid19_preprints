Abstract
Objective: This report describes the details of Mr. MAPP, a virtual mirror therapy system and the
results of a clinical feasibility and evaluation study of a pilot sample of patients with history of lower
limb amputation and phantom limb pain.
Materials and Methods: Mr. MAPP system uses a Kinect V2 RGB-D camera to capture the patient,
generates a live interactive 3D model, and incorporates it into a virtual exergame. Mr. MAPP mirrors
their preserved limb and allows participants to visualize their amputated limb virtually and perform
their prescribed exercise program. Mr. MAPP creates a digital diary of their therapy sessions by
recording game performance and errors. Ten consecutive patients with history of limb loss and
phantom pain were targeted for this pilot study. They received a Mr. MAPP system and a laptop for
home use for 1-month. Outcome measures including pain intensity and pain interference measured on
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) as well as functional outcomes
measured on Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) were obtained at baseline, and after 1-month.
Results: Seven participants were enrolled, out of which four completed the study. The study was
temporarily suspended due to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Ingame performance data showed a trend towards improvement in most participants. Compared to
baseline, NRS and MPQ scores at 1-month showed no clear trends. PSFS scores improved for 1
participant and remained unchanged for others.
Conclusion: Gamified home exercises performed via a novel, mixed-reality system—Mr. MAPP—
using which virtual mirror therapy was delivered, is feasible and has potential to improve pain and pain
related function in patients with lower limb amputations and phantom limb pain.

Introduction
Following a limb amputation, the amputee commonly experiences a phantom sensation of a still
intact amputated limb. Phantom limb pain (PLP) is defined as a painful phantom sensation perceived in
the amputated part of the body.[1, 2] PLP is frequently chronic (>3 months in duration) and is
considered one of the most traumatic consequences of amputation, reported in 50%–85% of amputee
patients.[3, 4] Patients with PLP have qualitatively described it as throbbing, “pins and needles”,
shooting, stabbing, burning, or telescoping, gnawing and cramping.[5-7] The type, frequency, and
stability of perception can vary.[8] The diverse nature of PLP makes its treatment challenging.
More than 25 treatments for PLP are currently available, yet there is no consensus choice or a
clearly superior option.[9-11] Several approaches have been recommended: behavioral (mirror visual
feedback, motor imagery, prosthesis use), psychological (cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, eye
movement), surgical, minimally invasive, pharmacological and psychophysical. A review of efficacy of
treatments including targeted muscle reinnervation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,
imaginal phantom limb exercises, mirror therapy, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR), and eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy revealed that none of the above treatments is
consistently better than a control condition.[12] No treatment has proven to be effective long-term
either.[13-15] In order to help maintain effectiveness long-term, better adherence of patients in
consistently performing their home exercise program (HEP) seems essential to achieve sustained
central nervous system modulation.[16] There is little high quality evidence of efficacy for PLP
treatments and most treatment trials are underpowered due to small sample sizes. The lack of efficacy
likely speaks to the multiple mechanisms that contribute to PLP both between and within individuals
who have sustained an amputation.
A classic non-pharmacological approach for treating PLP is mirror therapy (MT).[17] MT
provides this feedback by arranging a mirror (sometimes in a box, known as mirror box therapy [MBT])
in such a way as to allow amputees to view a reflection of their anatomical limb in the visual space

occupied by their amputated or phantom limb.[18, 19] MBT utilizes a cardboard box which is open
from the top. A mirror is placed at the center of the box. The patient is asked to place their intact limb
in front of the mirror and affected limb behind it such that an image of the intact limb is perceived as
the amputated limb. The movement of the unaffected limb during MT induces vivid sensations of
movement from the missing muscles and joints of the amputated limb, thereby reducing phantom limb
sensation and PLP in some patients.[17, 18, 20, 21] MT and MBT is however constrained by limited
spatial movement, requiring a patient to remain in a relatively still posture with the head oriented
towards the mirror and the body held in mid-sagittal plane with the mirror.[22] It also requires that the
user attempts to ignore the intact limb providing the reflection, in order to focus on the reflected image.
Furthermore, the illusion obtained is often wavering. These barriers may result in tedious and stressful
therapy sessions, which may substantially reduce treatment compliance.
To overcome these challenges, various virtual and mixed reality-based frameworks based on
recent advances in technology have been proposed as potential solutions.[22, 23] O’Neil et al. proposed
a virtual MBT which uses a pre-defined 3D model of the arm.[24] Animation of the virtual arm is
controlled by a wireless glove put on the patient’s intact limb. Sensors embedded in the glove enables
capture of the intact limb movement and its application to the virtual phantom limb. Desmond et al.
demonstrated a potential use of this virtual MBT to treat phantom pain.[25] Instead of capturing the
intact limb movement, Cole et al. captured the movement from the remaining portion of the affected
limb using motion capture devices.[26, 27] However, due to sensing limitation of the motion capture
device, only coarse movements could be detected; finer movements were pre-animated, which affected
the voluntarily movement. The above two approaches rely on a flat screen for rendering the phantom
limb illusion. On the other hand, Murray and colleagues designed a system where the virtual
environment is rendered on the head-mounted display. Motion of the intact limb is captured using body
sensors attached to different joint of the intact limb which is overlaid onto a pre-built 3D model of the
phantom limb. A myoelectrically controlled AR environment (MCARE) was proposed by Ortiz-Catalan

et al. which captured the patient and surrounding environment with the help of a standard webcam.[28,
29] Pre-built 3D models of the phantom limb was augmented with the real-time capture from webcam
and visualized on a flat screen. The 3D model of the phantom limb was animated using motion
information captured with eight bipolar electrodes and markers placed on the stump. In et al. proposed
a virtual reality-based reflection system that captured the intact lower limb with a camera from the
top.[30] The image of the intact limb was then projected at the corresponding position of the missing
limb on the screen creating a symmetrical illusion. However, any mismatch in the movement of the
affected limb could potentially disturb the illusion. Thus, it limited free and natural movement. Also, it
did not provide any interaction with a virtual object.
The above methods utilized pre-built 3D models of the phantom limb which can notably reduce
the sense of embodiment due to misalignment with the physical body part, artificial and rigid look, and
mismatch with skin tone and clothing. Moreover, these methods require patients to wear body sensors,
electrodes or wireless gloves for capturing movement information. It can potentially restrict voluntarily
movement, and cause discomfort or skin irritation. To overcome these challenges, Bahirat et al.
proposed a Mixed Reality based framework for MAnaging Phantom Pain (Mr. MAPP).[31] It generates
a 3D model of the phantom limb in real-time by capturing the 3D data corresponding to the intact limb
with off-the shelf RGB-D cameras and mirroring it. It also enables phantom limb interactions with
virtual objects providing realistic and engaging experience. The detailed summary of these methods
and their respective characteristics have been previously published.[32]
The primary goals of this clinical pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary
outcomes of a home-based virtual mirror therapy program delivered with the Mr. MAPP system in a
sample of patients with lower limb amputation. We plan to use the results from this clinical pilot study
as preliminary data to inform regarding a fully powered prospective, controlled, clinical trial to
determine the effectiveness of a home-based virtual mirror therapy program Mr. MAPP in treating
patients with limb loss suffering from PLP.

Materials and Methods

Mr. MAPP System Overview

The Mr. MAPP framework is designed to create a visual cue by generating corresponding
phantom limb in real-time. It leverages widely available RGB-D cameras such as Microsoft’s Kinect
(Figure 1).[32] It utilizes the RGB, Depth and Skeleton streams obtained from Kinect V2. Specifically,
the raw RGB and Depth streams are integrated to create a textured 3D mesh corresponding to the intact
limb.[33] Making use of the symmetry in human body about a medial axis, the skeleton stream
provided by Kinect SDK is used as an axis of symmetry for mirroring the intact limb. The 3D mesh of
the intact limb is then mirrored about a medial axis to create an illusion of the phantom limb. Moreover,
to facilitate the interaction of phantom limb with virtual objects, the skeleton part corresponding to the
intact limb is also mirrored.

Real time phantom mesh generation: Figure 2 shows the block diagram for the real-time
phantom mesh generation outlined in Mr, MAPP framework. It uses the body skeletal joints
information provided by Kinect SDK to identify the depth image corresponding to the person. This
filtered depth data and camera intrinsic parameters are used to back project each depth point into a real
world to obtain a 3D point cloud corresponding to the person. Further, to identify the points belonging
to the intact limb and affected limb, the correspondence between 3D points and skeletal segments is
established by performing the skeletal segmentation of the scanned point cloud as described in these
reports.[34, 35] Points corresponding to the affected limb can possibly interfere with the mirrored data
and therefore need to be removed apriori. Further, a 3D representation of phantom limb is crafted by
mirroring the 3D mesh of the intact limb about the medial axis, followed by post processing step of
hole filling. Detailed description of each step can be found in this paper (Figure 2).[31]

Extension for lower limb amputation: Even though most of the steps in Mr. MAPP framework can be
easily deployed for different limb amputations, a few minor adjustments are required for using it to
generate phantom lower limb illusion (Figure 3).[32]

In summary, the following three major issues are addressed to create realistic phantom limb
illusion in case of lower limb amputation with the Mr. MAPP framework:

1. Redefine skeletal coordinate system: If the skeletal coordinate system is defined at `spine` joint, any
upper body movement will result in unnatural movement of the lower phantom limb. Hence, skeletal
coordinate system must be redefined with `hip` joint at origin.
2. Jittery skeleton: In sitting posture, the skeleton estimation is jittery. Such instability is handled by
smoothing skeletal joints using the approach described in [36].
3. Asymmetric segmentation: Inaccurate skeletal estimation leads to asymmetric left and right lower
limb region. Such a misalignment between affected and intact limb (Figure 3b) may create gaps when
the affected limb is replaced with the mirrored data (Figure 3d). Hence, the root of the affected limb is
identified and fills the whole in the surrounding region is filled with the symmetric region from the
intact limb.

Clinical Pilot Study

System Setup and Requirements: Mr. MAPP utilizes Microsoft’s Kinect V2 to capture 3D avatar of the
person, a computer for running the games and an Oculus Rift for visualizing the virtual environment. A
computer used must have Windows 8 or newer, 64-bit (x64) dual-core processor, 2GB RAM and a
USB 3.0 port. Whereas, for the Oculus Rift to work, we need Intel i3-6100 / AMD Ryzen 3
1200,FX4350 or greater processor, NVIDIA GTX 960 4GB / AMD RadeonR9 290 or greater graphics
card, 8+ GB RAM, Windows 10 or newer, 1x USB 3.0 port, plus 2x USB 2.0 ports and a compatible
HDMI 1.3 video output.[32]

Physical Setup: While setting up the system, it is important to make sure that there is enough empty
space available to move around (approximately 3 meters x 5 meters). User can set up the safe boundary
area using the ‘Guardian System’ provided by Oculus. This initial space configuration will be
performed only once at the beginning of the study. Typically, the Kinect is placed at height of 1 meter
from the ground and person is asked to sit in the chair approximately at distance of 2.5-3 meters in
front of the Kinect. After launching the game and once the user is ready, they need to press a virtual
‘START’ button to begin playing the game. Interaction with the virtual ‘START’ button is achieved via
button ‘A’ or ‘X’ on the Oculus touch controller or using the mouse. The interface also provides the
ability to teleport user to the center of the virtual environment even if the user is not at the center of the
action space at the beginning. Also, the user can refine their position physically by slightly moving the
chair. However, it is recommended not to make any larger movements as a safety measurement. During
each game, user needs to perform corresponding exercise motion correctly in order to successfully
complete the game task.

Setting, Participants and Study Criteria: The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board.
Inclusion criteria: A total of 10 veterans, men and women, over the age of 18, with lower limb
amputations (greater than 3 months post-surgery) with phantom limb pain were recruited for the
clinical pilot and feasibility study. Exclusion criteria: Patients with open wounds or active infection in
residual or contralateral limbs; history of seizures; visual or cognitive impairment that interferes with
ability to interact with, participate in a computerized exercise program; any active cardiac condition or
an active medical issue that poses a contraindication to exercise therapy; lives more than 60 miles away
from the Dallas VA Medical Center; and history of motion sickness induced by head mounted displays
(HMDs) or immersive environment. Any patient experiencing the motion sickness induced by HMDs
during the therapy session could opt out of the study.

A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver was obtained using
which potential study participants with lower limb amputation who were established patients in our
Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R) clinics were screened for inclusion in the study. Eligible
study participants who met criteria were identified and underwent a basic clinical evaluation by
rehabilitation physician to confirm that they met criteria. After the evaluation, the patient provided their
informed consent and enrolled into the study.

Study Protocol and Intervention: Once consent was obtained, study participants were instructed on
safely performing the prescribed exercises using the Mr. MAPP system, independently at home. They
initially completed the outcome instrument questionnaires. After completing the questionnaire, they
donned the goggles and acquainted themselves with Mr. MAPP by moving around in the virtual world.
They were then instructed in their exercise therapy session.
Each exercise therapy session consisted of three sub-sections where the participant played three
different virtual games. These virtual games were designed specifically for persons with lower limb
amputation. Each game targeted certain types of movement. We focused mainly on three movements: 1)
knee flexion and extension, 2) ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, and 3) tandem coordinated
bilateral lower extremity movement. Each game required about 5 minutes to complete. Participants
were instructed to play 2 sessions per day for 1-month.
The research team then provided the Mr. MAPP system including a laptop, and camera and
instructed the patient in its use at their home. The participant then used the system to perform their
personalized home exercises daily for a 1-month period (to evaluate sustainability of exercise behavior).
At the end of this period, the system was returned.

Outcome Measures: At initial clinic visit, 1-week and 1-month visit, study participants completed
questionnaires of outcome instruments. Primary outcome measures were Pain score on 0-10 Numerical
Rating Scale (NRS), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS).

The participants rated their current average pain on a 0-10 NRS at each assessment.
Study participants provided a more detailed assessment of their pain using the MPQ at each
assessment. The MPQ is a classic pain assessment questionnaire that can be used to monitor the pain
over time and to determine the effectiveness of any intervention.[37] It was initially developed by Dr.
Melzack at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. The three sections of the MPQ are: (1) What Does
Your Pain Feel Like? (2) How Does Your Pain Change with Time? and (3) How Strong is Your Pain?
The PSFS is a useful questionnaire that can be used to quantify activity limitation and measure
functional outcome for patients with any physically disabling condition.[38] At initial assessment, the
participant is asked to identify up to three important activities that they are unable to do or are having
difficulty with as a result of their limb amputation and PLP. For each identified activity, they rated their
level of functional difficulty on a 0-5 scale. At each follow-up assessment, participants, re-rated their
level of functional difficulty on the same 0-5 scale for each identified activity. The total score = sum of
the activity scores/number of activities. The minimum detectable change (90% CI) for average score is
2 points, and minimum detectable change (90% CI) for single activity score is 3 points.
Participants received weekly telephone support and online ad-hoc technical support as needed.
Adverse event data were also collected, and clinicians were informed for any clinical intervention as
needed during this pilot study.
Clinical study data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data
Capture) electronic data capture tools hosted at the local VAMC. REDCap is a secure, web-based
software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive
interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures;
3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4)
procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources.

In-Game Data: The following data were automatically recorded into a ‘digital diary’ as users
played their prescribed exercise games at home: session time, duration, and gaming score. Through
session time and duration as attendance record, each participant’s engagement could be assessed. Also,
the attendance record could be used to verify the self-reported exercise diary by the patient. Each
participant’s progress in game performance could be evaluating their game score changes over time.
During the 1-month period when study participants used the Mr. MAPP system, each participant were
instructed to play two sessions every day where each session includes playing three different games: (1)
Ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion, (2) Knee flexion and extension and (3) Tandem coordinated
movement.
Scores obtained for any game over the course of the study can be a good indicator of
complexity of the game and comfort with respect to each individual participant. Using this information,
we can further fine tune the complexity of each game to make it more engaging and fun for each
participant based on their performance history. Therefore, we analyzed the scores obtained by all
participants for each game during the study.

Results

Ten participants were targeted in this clinical pilot study. However, due to restrictions imposed on all
clinical research activities at the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the study recruitment
has been temporarily halted at 7 study participants. Out of the 7 patients who consented to participate, 4
patients completed the entire study; 3 patients withdrew from the study (one patient did not follow-up;
one patient changed his mind; one patient had prosthesis associated pain and decided to withdraw from
the study until that issue could be remedied).

Study participants were mostly male 86% (6/7), mean age was 64, and 57% (4/7) were Black.
Most of them had transtibial amputations (Below the Knee-57%; 4/7) that were nearly 1400 days old
on an average (Table 1).
In-game Data: The following attributes of participants’ participation in the virtual exercise therapy
sessions were analyzed: attendance of therapy sessions, performance improvement over time and effect
of session duration on the performance.
The gaming time for participant #4 and #6 are illustrated in Figure 4. Both participants
meticulously performed their exercise therapy sessions daily for 1-month. In Figure 4a, participant #4
tended to start the exercise therapy session at the same time every day, but participant #6 varied their
start time. In contrast, digital diaries from participants #2 and #5 revealed more sporadic participation
in their exercise therapy sessions.
The game performance changes over time for each game were evaluated (Figure 5). Each
participant’s game performance changes were variable; hence a regression line estimated based on all
records across all participants for the game was drawn illustrating a general trend towards improvement
across all participants (Figure 5). For example, in the Tandem coordinated movement game (Figure 5a),
a positive correlation trend could be observed in participant #4 but the trend was not observed in
participant #6. In the Ankle dorsiflexion game, a slight positive correlation was noted in all participants
(Figure 5b). For the Knee flexion and extension game the trend is neutral over time.
The relationship between game performance and session duration was also assessed (Figure 6);
however, no clear correlation was noted. The Knee flexion and extension game took approximately 2 to
3 minutes to complete but the Ankle dorsiflexion game typically took less than 40 seconds. The
Tandem coordinated movement game was not included in this analysis since this game had a fixed
duration of 2 mins. However, some data anomalies were noted because with game score was zero in

some instances of game play despite several game launches and significant amount of playing time;
these data anomalies may have contributed to the lack of correlation.

Clinical Outcome Data: Among the 4 study participants who completed the 1-month clinical trial, no
clear trends (no improvement or worsening) in change in pain was noted in any of the 3 sections of the
MPQ (Table 2) or in pain intensity as rated on the weekly NRS in the exercise diary (paper) (Table 3).
However, anecdotally all 4 participants reported that they felt temporary pain relief after playing the
exercise therapy games on Mr. MAPP. Participant #2 reported that playing a game during an episode of
PLP exacerbation helped to reduce the pain level. No other participant self-initiated such therapy
sessions in an attempt to relieve their pain.
All 4 participants exercised weekly ranging from an average of 15.4 minutes per week
(participant #4) to 42.9 minutes per week (participant #5), with pain scores reported that ranged at the
low end between 0-1 for participant #5 and at the high end between 6-7 for participant #4.
PSFS data were available for 3 participants (Table 4). Each participant chose 2-3 activity related
goals. Participant #4 and #5 showed no change in PSFS scores (#4: 6.33 to 7.67 and #5: 7.5 to 6.5).
However, participant #6 demonstrated significant improvement in PSFS scores: 1 to 3.33; minimum
detectable change = 2.

Discussion

Results of this study showed that Mr. MAPP, an in-home exercise therapy system with its
gamified and interactive interface is clinically feasible and can motivate persons with lower limb
amputation and phantom limb pain to be more engaged and perform prescribed rehabilitative exercises
at home to help improve their pain intensity and pain-related interference with functioning.
Analysis of Mr. MAPP’s in-game digital diary revealed that participants tend to improve their
gaming performance mediated mainly through increase in number of repetitions. This suggests that the

gamified exercise therapy delivered with Mr. MAPP is challenging and can motivate the participants to
improve their exercising behavior over time.
The level of engagement varied from participant to participant. Some participants followed the
prescribed exercise regularly, but others did not. A couple of technical factors may have affected
engagement. First, positioning of the Kinect camera to accommodate for the participant’s unique home
environment constraints may have resulted in a sub-optimal set-up resulting in reduced quality of
gaming experience. For example, one participant had a shelf capable of housing the camera only at a
height of 1.5m from the ground, which is about 50% higher than the ideal height for camera placement;
accordingly, the reconstructed images were a little distorted for this participant. Second, in some cases
the available space to exercise was narrow, such as a narrow aisle in their bedroom, which resulted in
movement restriction and resultant poor experience.
Other environmental factors affected participant engagement as well. One factor was whether
there was any help available to operate the laptop. The game launch interface was on the laptop, but the
playing area typically is around 2m distance from the laptop and Kinect camera. Thus, without an
assistant who could help in operating the laptop for each session, the participant needed to take off the
HMD goggles, operate the laptop, and then move themselves back to the playing area, re-don the HMD
goggles, and then play. Some participants played the games while seated in their wheelchair since they
needed to move back and forth to operate the laptop when performing prescribed exercises.
Some unexpected issues were noted in the digital diary score record, where some sessions
resulted in gaming scores of ‘zero’. Two possible reasons for these issues include: a) orientation of
Kinect or Oculus sensor or position of the player was changed. During the initial home setup, the
technician would test the displacement of all devices until the game could work. However, after the
initial setup if the relative orientations and locations changed, the skeleton collider might not align well
with the reconstructed visual limb, resulting in the participant being unable to interact the visible virtual
limb with the virtual bubbles, or in the worst case scenario, unable to generate the virtual limb in the

virtual environment. b) the teleport procedure might not stable because the target position for
teleportation was determined based on the detected skeleton in run time. The goal of teleportation at the
beginning of the game is to bring the user to center of the game for interacting with virtual objects.
However, the estimated center may vary due to the difference skeleton detected in slightly different
postures. Typically, participant could self-correct this issue by moving around slightly to get closer to
the gaming center. However, if misplacement is in the vertical direction, this discrepancy cannot be
corrected, resulting in the participant not being able to play the game normally. Optimizing the above
technical and environmental factors is important in the future, as we plan fully powered clinical trials
with Mr. MAPP, so as to maximize patient engagement and quality of experience which will likely lead
to better clinical outcomes.
Study participants who completed the in-home trial with Mr. MAPP did not show any clear
trends in pain improvement assessed on the MPQ or the NRS. However, anecdotally all 4 participants
reported satisfaction with the system and temporary relief of pain after participating in the exercise
therapy sessions with Mr. MAPP. One participant also reported benefit by using the system during
episodes of phantom pain, which were instances of self-initiated treatment. Due to the intermittent and
episodic nature of phantom limb pain in many patients, self-initiated treatments during episodes can be
of value to patients and needs to be further studied. No participant showed significant worsening in
their pain outcome scores. These data suggest that performing rehabilitative exercise therapy sessions
using Mr. MAPP system has potential to improve phantom pain although no sustained pain
improvement was noted in this 1-month clinical pilot trial. Self-initiated treatment sessions to alleviate
pain during phantom pain episodes may be a feasible option for patients with PLP if this therapy
modality was available as needed at their disposal.
Analysis of the exercise diary data suggest that participants who completed the study were able
to adhere to their recommended exercise therapy protocol. Mr. MAPP system provided them the
motivation and incentive to perform their prescribed exercise therapy, and some were motivated to

perform additional sessions as well. Occasional discrepancies were noted between digital diary record
and paper exercise diary data, likely because of recall errors or participants including non-game
exercises also in their paper exercise diary record.
Analysis of PSFS scores indicated that there was no detectable change in 2 participants, but one
participant made significant functional gains with the use of the Mr. MAPP system for 1-month. These
data suggest that there is opportunity to improve in physical functioning in patients with phantom pain.
The likely mediator of this effect is pain related interference with functioning; if pain intensity is
lessened, and pain related interference is alleviated, pain related functioning improves as a result.
Additional evaluation of the effect of Mr. MAPP in pain, function and pain-related functioning would
help understand the mediators of functional improvement in patients with limb loss and phantom limb
pain. Behaviors that sustain motivation to perform their prescribed exercises, especially if this therapy
leads to pain and functional improvement, are desirable.
The potential to improve pain and functional outcomes in patients with chronic limb loss and
phantom limb pain, by non-pharmacological and non-invasive methods of treatment with that is homebased is a tremendous opportunity in healthcare. Improving the quality of life and function in this
patient population without additional utilization of trained healthcare personnel and with minimal
additional cost of care (given no specially trained personnel are required to oversee therapy sessions)
provides significant value to their healthcare. Furthermore, Mr. MAPP facilitated home exercise
therapy can potentially mitigate the increased utilization of rehabilitation services that is often observed
in this population.
None of the study participants reported any adverse events with the use of Mr. MAPP or with
any of the exercises they performed. All study participants were satisfied with the ease of use of the
system. All participants also expressed the desire to retain the system for a longer trial if that were
possible.

Future comparative trials between this system and usual standard of care MT or MBT may help
more conclusively demonstrate the benefit of this system for patients with limb loss and PLP. We also
plan to evaluate the outcomes of patients who self-initiate additional treatment sessions, and desire to
retain the system for longer trial duration. Also, we plan to develop a Mr. MAPP therapy system
module for patients with upper limb loss as well. Future, fully powered, randomized clinical trial
comparing Mr. MAPP to other standard of care pharmacologic or physical therapy interventions is also
being planned.

Limitations: This was a clinical feasibility and pilot evaluation study of a small sample of patients with
phantom limb pain, meaning this study was not powered to measure clinical efficacy. While some mild
trends in clinical improvement in pain and functional outcomes were observed, caution needs to be
exercised to avoid over-interpreting these outcomes. Also, we cannot clearly attribute the cause of the
observed outcomes to the intervention because this study was not statistically powered to evaluate
treatment effect and did not have a control group. Several factors that may influence outcomes were not
controlled in this study including duration of pain, type and characteristics of PLP, etiology of
amputation, or level of amputation. In addition, number of minutes exercises was variable within our
pilot sample of participants, which could have influenced outcomes. Although study participants did
show increased engagement over time and increasing motivation to perform prescribed therapy was an
objective of the intervention, motivation was not directly evaluated in this study. Despite the above
limitations, this clinical feasibility pilot study did demonstrate that exercises performed using virtual
mirror therapy with the Mr. MAPP system is clinically feasible and shows potential in its ability to
improve pain, and pain-related physical functioning outcomes for patients with limb loss and phantom
limb pain.

Conclusions

Using Mr. MAPP, a novel, gamified virtual mirror therapy system to perform exercises at home by
community-dwelling patients with limb loss is feasible and has potential to improve pain and painrelated functional outcomes. Further research including a fully powered prospective study with
appropriate control is needed to better evaluate its efficacy in improving pain and pain related function
for patients with limb amputations.
