Abstract
Pathologic immune hyperactivation is emerging as a key feature of critical illness in COVID-19, but the
mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We carried out proteomic profiling of plasma from
cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed clinical
data from our health system database of over 3,300 patients. Using a machine learning algorithm, we
identified a prominent signature of neutrophil activation, including resistin, lipocalin-2, HGF, IL-8, and GCSF, as the strongest predictors of critical illness. Neutrophil activation was present on the first day of
hospitalization in patients who would only later require transfer to the intensive care unit, thus preceding
the onset of critical illness and predicting increased mortality. In the health system database, early
elevations in developing and mature neutrophil counts also predicted higher mortality rates. Altogether,
we define an essential role for neutrophil activation in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and
identify molecular neutrophil markers that distinguish patients at risk of future clinical decompensation.

Main
As the death toll from COVID-19 reaches over 830,000 worldwide, it remains a pressing concern to
understand how the disease causes such a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes. For the majority of
patients, COVID-19 manifests as an upper respiratory tract infection that is self-limited. However, the
progression of COVID-19 in a large subset of patients to respiratory distress, multi-organ failure, and
death has resulted in an enormous global impact. A number of studies to date have highlighted an
important role for monocytes and macrophages in severe COVID-19,1,2 but our knowledge of the
immunological drivers of critical illness are otherwise limited.
To achieve a deeper understanding of the immunological phenotypes of COVID-19 across the
spectrum of disease severity, we performed proteomic profiling of blood obtained from hospitalized
patients with COVID-19 and used a machine learning algorithm to define the biomarkers that best
discriminate between critically ill patients and those with more mild disease. We discovered a unique
neutrophil activation signature composed of neutrophil activators (G-CSF, IL-8) and effectors (resistin
(RETN), lipocalin-2 (LCN2), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)), which had the greatest power of all
measured biomarkers to identify critically ill patients. The effector proteins strongly correlated with
absolute neutrophil count and were highly transcriptionally enriched in a developing neutrophil
population that was recently identified specifically in critically ill COVID-19 patients.3,4 To determine
whether this neutrophil activation signature precedes the onset of critical illness, we performed
longitudinal plasma analyses beginning on day 1 of patients’ hospitalization. We discovered that
elevated neutrophil biomarkers at the time of hospital admission identified those patients who would
later progress to critical illness and predicted increased in-hospital mortality. Finally, to determine
whether the mechanistic implications of this study are generalizable, we analyzed clinical data from a
cohort of over 3,300 patients and found that, at the earliest blood draw during hospitalization, high
numbers of developing and mature neutrophils detected in patients’ blood also predicted increased
mortality. This study identifies neutrophil activation as a defining feature of severe COVID-19 that
occurs prior to the onset of critical illness, implicating neutrophils as a central player in the
pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and highlighting opportunities for clinical prediction and therapeutic
intervention.
Results
Forty-nine adult patients (40 in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) and 9 in non-ICU units), as well as
13 non-COVID-19, non-hospitalized controls, were included in our initial ‘cross-sectional’ cohort (Table
1a). We performed multiplexed biomarker profiling on plasma obtained during the course of patients’
hospitalization, measuring concentrations of 78 circulating proteins with immunologic functions (Figure
1a, Supp. Fig. 1). Principal component analysis (PCA) of this dataset showed separation of the control,

non-ICU COVID-19, and ICU COVID-19 samples, indicating that these circulating markers capture a
spectrum of illness severity (Figure 1b).
To assess if this profile of plasma biomarkers could distinguish between critically ill and non-critically ill
patients, we applied a random forest machine learning prediction model. The model was trained on
data from 2/3 of the subjects, and its ability to predict ICU status was tested on the remaining 1/3 of the
subjects. The model accurately identified 14 out of 14 patients in the ICU and 7 out of 7 subjects not in
the ICU (Figure 2a). To avoid introducing bias based on treatment, the random forest model and PCA
analyses excluded IL-6 because most (38/40) ICU patients received tocilizumab, which is known to
increase IL-6 levels.5 These results demonstrate that our proteomic profile provides a highly reliable
circulating signature of critical illness in COVID-19.
To gain insight into the specific plasma proteins that may affect disease severity, we next examined the
importance of each feature in the random forest prediction model. Five of the top six features
contributing to the model were proteins related to neutrophil activation (Figure 2b, 2c). Three of the top
four features were RETN, LCN2, and HGF, each of which is produced by neutrophils, stored in
neutrophil ‘specific’ or ‘secondary’ granules, and released upon neutrophil activation.6-11 The next two
highest ranking features were IL-8 and G-CSF, which stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis and
development, respectively.12,13
Next, we assessed whether this neutrophil activation signature alone could discriminate between
critically ill (ICU) and non-critically ill (non-ICU) patients. We repeated random forest modeling using
only the markers of neutrophil activation (RETN, LCN2, HGF, IL-8, and G-CSF) and found that
circulating levels of this selective panel also accurately classified all test subjects into ICU and non-ICU
categories (Figure 2a). Interestingly, each of the neutrophil activation markers showed greater
discriminatory power for critical illness than previously described monocyte/macrophage markers (with
the exception of MIG/CXCL9) that were also included in our proteomic panel (Figure 1a, Figure 2b,
Supp. Fig. 1),14,15 which suggests an essential role for neutrophils in the development of critical illness
associated with COVID-19.
To interrogate the source of neutrophil granule proteins RETN, LCN2, and HGF within our patient
cohort, we analyzed the correlation of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at the time of blood draw
with all of the circulating markers that we had measured. We found that RETN, HGF, and LCN2 were
the three proteins that most strongly correlated with ANC (Spearman's r = 0.633, p < 0.001; 0.555, p <
0.001; and 0.492, p < 0.0001, respectively) (Figure 3a). To gain further insight into the cellular source
of these proteins in COVID-19, we analyzed data from a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) study
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with COVID-19.3 We found that RETN
and LCN2 transcripts were highly enriched in a circulating cell population designated as “developing
neutrophils” (p < 10e-300 for each), which was detected almost exclusively in severely ill patients with
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Figure 3b, Supp. Fig. 2).3 Another highly enriched
marker (p < 10e-300) for this population was matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8), or neutrophil
collagenase (Figure 3b). Notably, constituents of neutrophil granules, like RETN, LCN2, and MMP8,
are transcribed at earlier stages of neutrophil development, packaged into granules, and later released
from mature neutrophils upon degranulation.16 These observations provide additional support for the
conclusion that neutrophils are the primary source of the circulating markers of critical illness in COVID19 that we identified.
In our initial cross-sectional cohort, blood was collected after patients had been hospitalized for a
variable length of time (between 2 and 45 days after admission), limiting our capacity to determine
whether the observed neutrophil signature was a consequence of critical illness or whether it preceded
its onset. To address this, we established a second, longitudinal cohort of patients. Proteomic plasma
profiling was conducted on blood samples collected serially starting on day 1 (within 24 hours of
hospital admission) from 23 consecutive patients admitted for treatment of confirmed COVID-19 who
remained hospitalized for at least 4 days (Figure 4a, Supp. Fig. 3, 4). To broaden our assessment of

neutrophil activation, we included a panel of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases (TIMPs), including MMP8, a marker of the ‘developing neutrophil’ population
(Figure 3b).17 Consistent with our findings in the cross-sectional cohort, RETN, HGF, and LCN2 in the
day 1 samples of the longitudinal cohort showed strong correlations with ANC (Spearman's r = 0.76, p
< 0.0001; 0.60, p =0.0031; and 0.73, p = 0.0001, respectively), and MMP8 was the protein most highly
correlated with ANC (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001), further supporting a neutrophilic source of these proteins in
COVID-19 (Supp. Fig. 5).
Sixteen patients in the longitudinal cohort were initially admitted to lower-acuity non-ICU units, and
seven patients were admitted directly to the ICU (‘ICU-Admit’) (Table 1b). Of the patients admitted to
non-ICU units, nine remained in those units until discharge (‘non-ICU’), while seven required transfer to
the ICU during their hospital stay (‘ICU-Transfer’) (six patients were transferred due to worsening
respiratory failure (Supp. Table 1), and one patient was transferred due to hypotension in the setting of
gastrointestinal bleeding). Consistent with our observations in the cross-sectional cohort, ICU-Admit
patients had significantly higher levels of all neutrophil activation markers than non-ICU patients on day
1 of hospitalization (Figure 4b, Supp. Fig. 3b). As predicted, the same pattern was observed for MMP8
which, like RETN, HGF, and LCN2, is stored and released from secondary granules of neutrophils.18,19
Remarkably, the levels of the neutrophil activation markers on day 1 of hospitalization were also
significantly elevated in the ICU-Transfer patients, at levels comparable to ICU-Admit patients and well
above the levels in non-ICU patients (Figure 4b). In both ICU-Transfer and ICU-Admit patients, the
neutrophil activation markers remained elevated from the day of admission to day 7 of hospitalization
and did not change appreciably over time, while these levels in non-ICU patients remained stably low
(Supp. Fig. 3b). Thus, despite the fact that patients in the ICU-Transfer group were not critically ill at
the time of the day 1 blood draw, evidence of neutrophil activation was already present in these
patients. The neutrophil activation signature identified patients who were primed for eventual transfer to
the ICU, prior to the onset of critical illness.
Previously reported markers of macrophage activation, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and MIG/CXCL9
were also elevated in ICU-Admit and ICU-Transfer patients compared to non-ICU patients on day 1 of
hospitalization (Supp. Fig. 4). Notably, most of these markers (as well as IL-8 and G-CSF) were also
significantly elevated in non-ICU patients compared to controls, whereas the neutrophil granule proteins
(RETN, LCN2, HGF, MMP8) that directly reflect neutrophil activation were not elevated in non-ICU
patients compared to controls and were only significantly different in patients who would go on to
develop critical illness (Figure 4b, Supp. Fig. 4). Altogether, these data indicate that both neutrophil
activation and monocyte/macrophage activation precede the onset of critical illness. They also suggest
that neutrophil degranulation may be a more specific feature of severe COVID-19.
To further validate our findings, we conducted additional analyses using RETN, the factor that was
most important in distinguishing critical illness in our random forest prediction model. Among patients
who did not require direct ICU admission (non-ICU, ICU-Transfer), those with day 1 RETN levels above
the median value were much more likely to later require ICU transfer (Figure 4c). Moreover, among all
patients in this cohort, those with day 1 RETN levels above the median were significantly less likely to
survive (Figure 4d). In addition to RETN, we found that higher levels on hospital day 1 of LCN2, GCSF, IL-8, and MMP-8, as well as IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-1RA, and M-CSF, were significantly associated
with mortality (Supp. Fig. 6). Meanwhile, we found that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which
has been reported as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19,20 was not significantly different between nonICU and ICU-Transfer patients on the first day of hospitalization (Supp. Fig. 7), suggesting that this
measure of cell count ratio may not distinguish critical illness as clearly as the molecular markers of
neutrophil activation. Interestingly, neither NLR nor D-dimer, another well-established marker of
disease severity in COVID-19, were significantly different between patients who did and did not survive
their hospitalization, unlike the neutrophil and macrophage activation markers (Supp. Fig. 6).

Lastly, we explored whether these mechanistic insights regarding the role of neutrophils in severe
COVID-19 could be validated in a large patient population hospitalized with COVID-19. Using an
extensive database of laboratory and clinical data from 3,325 patients admitted to Yale-New Haven
Health System who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (DOM-CovX cohort; Table 1c), we examined the
first recorded values of immature granulocyte (IG) and neutrophil counts during the course of their
hospitalization. We used these early values in order to avoid potential confounding effects of
hospitalization, such as therapeutic interventions and secondary infections. We found that in-hospital
mortality was significantly higher among patients with elevated initial IG absolute count (Figure 5a), IG
percent (Figure 5b), and ANC (Figure 5c). Interestingly, we did not find that initial absolute monocyte
count was associated with increased mortality (Figure 5d). While our molecular markers of neutrophil
activation are not available in this large cohort, these findings confirm that early signs of neutrophil
development are associated with future mortality in one of the largest COVID-19 patient cohorts
assessed to date.
Discussion
Our analyses of multiple hospitalized patient cohorts with COVID-19 reveal a consistent protein-level
signature of neutrophil development and activation in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Moreover, we
demonstrate for the first time that elevations in circulating markers of neutrophil and macrophage
activation precede the onset of critical illness, identifying non-critically ill patients who are at risk of
becoming critically ill. Based on our machine learning prediction algorithm, markers of neutrophil
activation had greater discriminatory power for detecting critical illness than other cytokines previously
shown to be associated with severe COVID-19,14,15 most of which were also included in our proteomic
profile. Furthermore, in one of the largest cohorts of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 analyzed to
date, we find that increased immature granulocyte and neutrophil counts early in hospitalization are
associated with increased mortality. The presence of conspicuous neutrophil activation in critically ill
patients with COVID-19 may not have been detected in prior analyses of circulating biomarkers and
flow cytometry because neutrophil granule proteins are not included in standard cytokine panels and
because neutrophils tend to be excluded during routine preparations of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells. By identifying a consistent signature of neutrophil development and activation that anticipates the
onset of critical illness, our findings suggest that neutrophils may play a central role in the pathogenesis
of severe COVID-19.
The host response to infection can be understood as a balance between resistance (the ability to
eliminate a pathogen) and tolerance (the ability to maintain essential biological functions in the
presence of a pathogen).21 The immune response is essential for pathogen resistance, but it can also
cause costly tissue injury, leading to a failure of tolerance. Neutrophils and macrophages are critical
arms of the innate immune system and are often the first responders to infection and injury. However,
neutrophils can also cause significant collateral damage to tissues.22 While an important role for
monocytes and macrophages in severe COVID-19 has been well described,2 a potential role for
neutrophils has been suggested by the prognostic value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio,20 and
recent studies have identified a population of immature neutrophils present in the blood of critically ill
COVID-19 patients, as well as increased numbers of neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage.1,3,4,23
However, it has remained unclear whether there is heightened neutrophil activation in severe COVID19, and whether the observed innate immune response is a consequence or potential cause of critical
illness.
In this study, we first used plasma proteomics and an unbiased machine-learning analysis, which
revealed that the factors that best discriminated between critically ill and non-critically ill patients were
neutrophil-related proteins. Two members of this neutrophil signature, G-CSF and IL-8, stimulate
neutrophil development and chemotaxis and have previously been associated with severe COVID-19.5
It was recently reported that IL-8 levels predict survival in a large cohort of hospitalized patients.5 The
mechanistic significance of these findings, however, was not clear. In this study, together with G-CSF
and IL-8, we identify four proteins that are released from neutrophils upon activation, which are among

the strongest predictors of critical illness. Elevated HGF levels have previously been reported in severe
COVID-19 but were not associated with neutrophil activity, while RETN, LCN2, and MMP8 are all novel
markers of critical illness in COVID-19.24 Focusing our attention on this neutrophil activation signature,
we found that a machine learning model based only on these markers was also able to accurately
classify patients according to their disease severity, indicating that neutrophil activation is a consistent
feature found in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
We reasoned that if neutrophil activation plays a causal role in the development of critical illness, then
evidence of neutrophil activation should be present prior to the onset of critical illness. To address this
question, we analyzed plasma collected longitudinally from a separate cohort of hospitalized patients
with COVID-19. We found that the neutrophil activation signature was already elevated on day 1 of
hospitalization in patients who were not critically ill at that time but would go on to develop critical illness
and require transfer to the ICU. Among all patients, day 1 elevations in neutrophil activation markers
were also associated with increased mortality during hospitalization. Interestingly, levels of the
neutrophil activation markers within each group were relatively stable when sampled over time. These
findings indicate that neutrophil activation precedes the onset of critical illness and suggest, 1) that
neutrophils may play an essential role in driving critical illness, which could be targeted therapeutically,
and 2) that this neutrophil activation signature has the potential to provide a powerful clinical tool for
early detection of the need for higher-level care or targeted therapies.
The neutrophil markers we identified suggest a model of neutrophil development and activation in
severe COVID-19: We hypothesize that high levels of the growth factor G-CSF stimulate neutrophil
production and that the chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8) drives neutrophil migration into the lung and perhaps
other tissues.12,13,25 Among neutrophils’ key effector mechanisms is the release of granules containing
proteins with antimicrobial and other functions in inflammation. RETN, LCN2, HGF, and MMP8 are wellestablished products of neutrophil secondary granules,7-10,26,27 and detection of these proteins at high
concentrations in the circulation of critically ill COVID-19 patients strongly suggests neutrophil activation
and degranulation. The high degree of correlation between these markers and ANC further supports
that model.
Three of these proteins, RETN, LCN2, and MMP8, were also among the top transcriptional markers of
a developing neutrophil population that has been identified specifically in the blood of severely ill
COVID-19 patients.3,4 Although these cells could in principle be the direct source of the proteins we
detect in circulation, it is more likely that the genes are transcribed in the developing neutrophils and
subsequently packaged into granules and released from mature neutrophils, a sequence of events that
is well-described in the neutrophil literature. Constituents of secondary granules, including RETN,
LCN2, and MMP8, are known to be transcribed specifically in the myelocyte stage of development by
the transcription factor C/EBPε, whose expression is essentially restricted to this phase.8,16,27-29 C/EBPε
was also highly enriched in the observed developing neutrophil population,3 suggesting that these cells
are largely myelocytes that have entered the circulation. Typically, neutrophil development takes place
in the bone marrow, and immature forms like myelocytes are not detected in the blood. However,
during emergency granulopoiesis, neutrophil development accelerates, and immature granulocytes exit
the bone marrow and enter the circulation. This process is thought to be driven by high levels of GCSF, which we detect in the blood of severely ill patients in this study.12 Furthermore, in our analysis of
a hospital-wide dataset, we find that the earliest counts of immature granulocytes (which include
myelocytes) predict mortality. Altogether, a model of emergency granulopoiesis followed by neutrophil
activation is beginning to emerge as a key feature of critical illness in COVID-19.
Components of our neutrophil activation signature have effector functions that may be detrimental to
patients with COVID-19. RETN regulates production of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and
TNF-α,30 and is associated with increased endothelial permeability and risk of thrombosis.31 LCN2,
while initially described to have antimicrobial activities,32 is highly upregulated in autoimmune diseases
such as systemic lupus erythematosus,33 Kawasaki disease,34 and inflammatory bowel disease.35
Elevated levels of MMP8 were associated with worsening clinical outcomes in pediatric patients with

ARDS.36 Inappropriate release of these and other components of neutrophil granules may drive key
aspects of critical illness in COVID-19, as suggested by previous studies investigating the contribution
of neutrophils to acute lung injury.37
The signature of neutrophil activation that we identify is accompanied by monocyte and macrophage
activation that has previously been described in severe COVID-19. Cytokines produced by both
activated neutrophils and macrophages were elevated on day 1 of hospitalization in patients who would
ultimately develop critical illness and in patients who did not survive, suggesting that these cell types
may function together in the pathogenesis of severe disease. Neutrophil and macrophage responses
are highly coordinated with one another in infection and injury. For instance, neutrophil granule proteins
stimulate monocyte chemotaxis, macrophages are responsible for phagocytosing apoptotic neutrophils,
and macrophage-derived proteins, including IL-8, G-CSF, and TNF, stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis
and survival.38 Interestingly, whereas macrophage-derived cytokines are also markedly increased in
non-ICU patients compared to controls, the release of neutrophil-derived granule proteins appears to
be more restricted to patients who are or will become critically ill, suggesting that neutrophil activation
and degranulation may be a key event in the progression to severe disease.
Neutrophils classically respond to bacterial infection or tissue injury; whether SARS-CoV-2 induces a
specific type of cellular or tissue damage that promotes neutrophil activation will require further
investigation. Moreover, the specific cell types that express G-CSF and IL-8 in COVID-19 will need to
be elucidated. It is possible that there is a threshold of injury to the lungs, and perhaps the vascular
beds, that triggers neutrophil activation,39,40 setting in motion the cascade of events that propagate
critical illness in COVID-19. This might explain the observation that many patients in the hospital initially
appear clinically stable and then rapidly deteriorate, requiring ICU care and mechanical ventilation.
Directly testing the causal role of neutrophil activation in COVID-19 will require animal models that
recapitulate the activation of neutrophils and allow for manipulation, or targeted therapeutic intervention
in patients. However, it is notable that neutropenic patients who have received exogenous G-CSF show
increased mortality, providing further support for a potential causal relationship between neutrophil
development and activation and adverse clinical outcomes.41,42
Our study suggests several potential therapeutic strategies, including inhibition of G-CSF, IL-8, or other
drivers of neutrophil activation, but the potential benefit of such strategies will need to be weighed
carefully against the risks of modulating a key aspect of the innate immune system. The recent finding
that dexamethasone improves mortality in COVID-19 offers strong support for the model that
immunopathology plays an important role in COVID-19 pathogenesis,43 but it does not identify the key
immune components involved in this process. It is notable, however, that one of the oldest recognized
effects of corticosteroid treatment is the inhibition of neutrophil binding to endothelial cells, preventing
infiltration into tissues (and paradoxically increasing their numbers in circulation).44 It will be essential to
continue to close the gap in our understanding of how the host immune response determines clinical
outcomes in COVID-19 and how this response can be selectively targeted to provide safer and more
effective immunomodulatory treatments.
In summary, we demonstrate that increased circulating levels of neutrophil activators (G-CSF, IL-8) and
neutrophil effectors (RETN, LCN2, HGF, and MMP8) are hallmarks of critical illness in COVID-19 and
that they identify high risk patients upon initial admission to the hospital, prior to the onset of critical
illness. We also demonstrate, in one of the largest cohorts of COVID-19 patients to date, that early
rises in immature granulocyte and neutrophil counts are associated with increased mortality, suggesting
that our mechanistic insights are generalizable to broader COVID-19 patient populations. These
findings represent key advances toward understanding the mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis,
developing more accurate prognostic indicators, and most importantly, guiding the next generation of
therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Study Design and Participants. We first conducted a study of 49 adult patients admitted to Yale-New
Haven Hospital between April 13, 2020 and April 24, 2020 with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 via
polymerase chain reaction (designated ‘cross-sectional’ cohort). The protocol was approved by the
Yale University Institutional Review Board (IRB #2000027792). Plasma samples were analyzed from 40
patients who were treated in a medical ICU and 9 patients in a non-ICU COVID-19 unit in our hospital.
Admission to the ICU was based on established ICU admission guidelines (Supp. Table 1). For this
cohort, blood was collected at a single timepoint during the course of hospitalization (Supp. Fig. 8).
Blood samples collected from an additional 13 asymptomatic, non-hospitalized, presumed SARS-COV2 negative controls were also analyzed after signed consents were obtained for a separate approved
IRB protocol (IRB #1401013259).
We also analyzed blood samples obtained longitudinally on day 1 (within 24 hours), day 4, and day 7 of
hospitalization from a separate cohort of 23 consecutive adult patients who were admitted for treatment
of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between May 23, 2020 and May 28, 2020 and remained hospitalized
until at least day 4 (designated ‘longitudinal’ cohort).
Lastly, we used the Yale Department of Medicine Covid Explorer (DOM-CovX) database to evaluate
blood count data from a total of 3,325 deidentified COVID-19-positive patients admitted to the six
hospitals within the Yale New Haven Health System (IRB #2000028509) (designated ‘CovX’ cohort).
Patients with a confirmed positive COVID-19 test within 14 days preceding their hospitalization were
included in the cohort. This dataset combines all clinical variables extracted from the electronic medical
record (Epic, Verona WI) including demographics, comorbidities, procedures, and all laboratory
recorded during the hospitalization.
Procedures. Blood was collected in 3.2% sodium citrate tubes and centrifuged at 2000 g for 20
minutes at room temperature, and the resulting plasma supernatant was frozen at -80°C and used for
further testing. The biomarker profiling analyses were conducted at Eve Technologies (Calgary,
Alberta, Canada). For the cross-sectional cohort, the following assays were performed: Human
Cytokine 71-Plex, Human Complement Panels 1 and 2, Human SAA & ADAMTS13, and Human
Adipokine 5-Plex. For the longitudinal cohort, the following assays were performed: Human Cytokine
48-Plex, Human Complement Panel 1, Human Adipokine 5-Plex, and Human MMP 9-Plex and TIMP 4Plex. Five of the control samples were evaluated concurrently with the longitudinal cohort samples
(Table 1b). Heatmaps were generated using the concentrations of circulating biomarkers obtained
from biomarker profiling analyses using Heatmapper as described.45
Principal component analysis and random forest classifier. Values for biomarker profiles of
patients in the cross-sectional cohort were log transformed. A pseudocount of half the minimum
observed non-zero value per biomarker was added to each observed zero value before log 10
transformation. IL-6 was excluded from modeling, as most subjects (38 out of 40) in the ICU subset of
the cross-sectional cohort had received IL-6 receptor blockade prior to blood collection. The remaining
biomarker values were used in a principal component analysis and a random forest classifier using the
scikit-learn python package.46 Data were partitioned into 66-33 train-validation split (training cohort: 26
ICU patients, 7 non-ICU patients, 3 controls; validation cohort: 14 ICU patients, 2 non-ICU patients, 5
controls), and all biomarkers were then used to predict the ICU status. A maximal tree depth of 10 was
used and the minimal cost-complexity was set to 0.02, otherwise all other parameters were set to their
defaults. Feature importance was assessed using mean decrease in impurity. Data restricted to five
biomarkers of interest with high feature importance were then used in a separate random forest
classifier, using the same methods.
Single cell analyses. Processed count matrices with de-identified metadata and embeddings from a
single-cell RNAseq dataset published by Wilk et al were downloaded from the COVID-19 Cell Atlas
(https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/#2iki20) hosted by the Wellcome Sanger Institute.3 This dataset was

further analyzed using Seurat (version 3.0, https://satijalab.org/seurat). The clusters in this object were
renamed based on cell type, using the UMAPs and heat maps provided. A new metadata column,
"ARDSstatus" was added to the object, which grouped the samples into the categories “Control",
"COVID19-non-ARDS", and "COVID19-ARDS". Violin and Feature Plots were generated to examine
specific genes of interest. The cells identified as “Developing Neutrophil'' were subsetted from the
overall object to examine this population more closely.
Statistical Analyses. To evaluate differences in mean age across the groups we used one-way
ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's multiple comparisons tests in the cross-sectional cohort and KruskalWallis test in the longitudinal cohort, as the samples in the former cohort but not the latter conformed to
the normal distribution. For the comparisons of proportions of men and women in the cohorts we used
Chi-square tests in the cross-sectional cohort and Fisher’s exact test in the longitudinal cohort. In both
cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts, we examined differences in proportions of patients with
comorbidities using Fisher’s exact test.
To compare biomarker values, we used two-sample tests. As most sample distributions did not satisfy
Anderson-Darling and D'Agostino-Pearson tests of normality, we used the unpaired two-tailed MannWhitney u-test. For samples that conformed to the normal distribution we used unpaired two-sided ttests with Welch correction for unequal variances, where applicable; where appropriate, p values were
corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate procedure with the discovery rate Q of
5%. P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Correlation coefficients between absolute neutrophil count and each biomarker was computed using
Spearman’s rank method. For Kaplan-Meier survival analyses we used median values of evaluated
variables as cut points to classify patients into two groups, high and low, based on whether patients’
values for a particular biomarker or cell count were above or below the cut point. We then used logrank test to compare the two groups of patients for each evaluated variable. To determine p-values for
cell-type-specific enrichment of genes in single-cell RNAseq data, we used Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.
All statistical analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism (v8.4.3, GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA), Stata (v16, StataCorp. College Station, TX), and R (v4, R Core Team, 2020).

Figure 3. Circulating neutrophil granule proteins are likely derived from neutrophilic
source in COVID-19 patients. (a) Correlations of circulating biomarkers with absolute
neutrophil count (ANC) in the cross-sectional cohort. Neutrophil granule proteins, which show
the highest correlation with ANC, are highlighted. R, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient;
p, p-value. (b) Violin plots of resistin (RETN), lipocalin-2 (LCN2), and matrix metallopeptidase
8 (MMP8) mRNA, showing enrichment in a ‘developing neutrophil’ population, based on reanalysis of single-cell RNAseq data published by Wilk et al of peripheral blood mononuclear
cells from patients with COVID-19.3

Figure 4. Elevation of the neutrophil activation signature precedes the onset of critical
illness. (a) Heatmap indicating relative protein levels detected on day 1 in each subject in
the longitudinal cohort (columns) for all biomarkers tested (rows). Proteins are categorized by
biological function. (b) Comparisons of circulating levels of neutrophil markers in subjects
categorized as: 1) controls, 2) non-ICU, 3) ICU-Transfer, and 4) ICU-Admit. ‘Non-ICU’
indicates patients who remained in a non-ICU unit until discharge; ‘ICU-Transfer’ indicates
patients who were admitted to a non-ICU unit and were transferred to an ICU unit during
hospitalization; ‘ICU-Admit’ indicates patients who were admitted directly to an ICU unit.
Asterisks denote statistically significant differences between groups (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01,
***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). (c) Kaplan-Meier curve depicting the likelihood of ICU admission
depending on resistin (RETN) levels on day 1, using the median of the group (non-ICU and
ICU-Transfer) as the cut-off value. (d) Kaplan-Meier curve depicting the likelihood of survival
depending on resistin levels on day 1, using the median of the group (entire longitudinal
cohort) as the cut-off value.
