Abstract

28
29

Large-scale wastewater surveillance has the ability to greatly augment the tracking of

30

infection dynamics especially in communities where the prevalence rates far exceed the

31

testing capacity. However, current methods for viral detection in wastewater are severely

32

lacking in terms of scaling up for high throughput. In the present study, we employed an

33

automated magnetic-bead based concentration approach for viral detection in sewage that can

34

effectively be scaled up for processing 24 samples in a single 40-minute run. The method

35

compared favorably to conventionally used methods for viral wastewater concentrations with

36

higher recovery efficiencies from input sample volumes as low as 10ml and can enable the

37

processing of over 100 wastewater samples in a day. The sensitivity of the high-throughput

38

protocol was shown to detect cases as low as 2 in a hospital building with a known COVID-

39

19 caseload. Using the high throughput pipeline, samples from the influent stream of the

40

primary wastewater treatment plant of San Diego county (serving 2.3 million residents) were

41

processed for a period of 13 weeks. Wastewater estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome

42

copies in raw untreated wastewater correlated strongly with clinically reported cases by the

43

county, and when used alongside past reported case numbers and temporal information in an

44

autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model enabled prediction of new

45

reported cases up to 3 weeks in advance. Taken together, the results show that the high-

46

throughput surveillance could greatly ameliorate comprehensive community prevalence

47

assessments by providing robust, rapid estimates.

48

49

Importance

50

Wastewater monitoring has a lot of potential for revealing COVID-19 outbreaks before they

51

happen because the virus is found in the wastewater before people have clinical symptoms.

52

However, application of wastewater-based surveillance has been limited by long processing

53

times specifically at the concentration step. Here we introduce a much faster method of

54

processing the samples, and show that its robustness by demonstrating direct comparisons

55

with existing methods and showing that we can predict cases in San Diego by a week with

56

excellent accuracy, and three weeks with fair accuracy, using city sewage. The automated

57

viral concentration method will greatly alleviate the major bottleneck in wastewater

58

processing by reducing the turnaround time during epidemics.

59

60

61

Main
Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) can facilitate detailed mapping of the extent

62

and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a community and has seen a rapid rise in recent months owing

63

to its cost effectiveness as well as its ability to foreshadow trends ahead of diagnostic testing

64

(1-4). With over 46 million cases reported globally, 9.3 million of which are from the United

65

States, there is an imminent need for rapid, community-level surveillance in order to identify

66

potential outbreak clusters ahead of diagnostic data. Previous studies have reported high

67

levels of correlation between viral concentration in sewage to clinically reported cases in a

68

community with trends appearing 2-8 days ahead in wastewater (2, 5). A major bottleneck in

69

large scale wastewater surveillance is the lack of robust, high throughput viral concentration

70

methodology. Conventional techniques for viral concentration from wastewater typically

71

employ laborious or time-consuming processes, namely polyethylene glycol (PEG) based

72

precipitation, direct filtration or ultra-filtration methods that severely limit throughput (6). In

73

the present study, we employed an affinity-capture magnetic hydrogel particle (Nanotrap) -

74

based viral concentration method which was incorporated on the KingFisher Flex liquid-

75

handling robot platform robots (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), using a 24-plex head to

76

process 24 samples at once in a 40 min run. RNA is then extracted on the same Kingfisher

77

system for rapid sample processing. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain

78

reaction (RT-qPCR) targeting N1, N2, E-gene targets was used for detection and

79

quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Detection of all 3 genes in a sample and its replicate (at

80

Cq values <39) was considered positive. All steps from concentration to RT-qPCR plating

81

were carried hands-free and carried out by liquid handlining robots to minimize human error.

82

Using the above pipeline, 96 raw sewage samples were processed in a period of 4.5 hours

83

(concentration to RT-qPCR detection/quantification) effectively reducing the processing time

84

by at least 20-fold. The sensitivity of detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in wastewater by

85

the high-throughput pipeline (i.e. to determine if individual buildings yield sufficient

86

wastewater signal for high-resolution spatial studies) was established by routinely monitoring

87

the SARS-CoV-2 signatures in the wastewater of a San Diego hospital building housing

88

active COVID-19 patients (7). This site was used as a positive control to test correlations

89

with caseload on a daily basis. Sewage samples were collected daily for a period of 12 weeks

90

during which time the hospitalâ€™s case load (specific to Covid-19 patients) varied between 2-

91

26. SARS-CoV-2 viral gene copies correlated with the daily hospital caseload (r=0.75, Suppl.

92

Fig. S1) suggesting that the wastewater data could at least be used to identify the peaks.

93

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in wastewater on all days sampled. Furthermore, the

94

high-throughput protocol has been used as a part of an on-campus wastewater surveillance

95

for the last few months where data from 70 autosamplers covering individual buildings are

96

sampled and analyzed on a daily basis. The method enabled detection of cases as low as 1 in

97

large buildings (manuscript in preparation, data available on request).

98

99

The efficiency of high throughput concentration method was compared to the two

100

other commonly implemented concentration methods (electronegative membrane filtration

101

and Polyethylene glycol, PEG-based) using nine-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated

102

SARS-CoV-2 viral particles spiked into 10 mL volumes of raw sewage which was previously

103

verified to be from a location with no SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and verified by RT-qPCR

104

(Suppl. Methods). The high-throughput protocol compared favorably to the conventionally

105

used protocols demonstrating its potential implications for large scale sample processing

106

(>100 samples/day) (Suppl. Fig. S2.A, Suppl. Fig. S3, Table S1). The average viral recovery

107

efficiencies were 27% (SD 8%), 15% (SD 9%) and 13% (SD 8%) respectively for the high-

108

throughput, PEG and HA filtration protocol (Suppl. Methods S1). The improved recovery

109

could also be attributed in part due to the specificity of the magnetic beads in recovering viral

110

particles coupled with a magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction protocol as well. The

111

protocol was optimized on the KingFisher for optimal bead-binding through homogenization

112

(dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bptemnje). Furthermore, the automated protocol was

113

hands-free and less prone to user discrepancies than the other 2 methods which were carried

114

out manually.

115

116

24-hour flow weighted composites were collected each day for 3 months between

117

July 20th-October 21st, 2020 from the influent stream of Point Loma wastewater treatment

118

plant. The plant processes over 175 MGD (million gallons per day) of raw sewage and is the

119

primary treatment center for the greater San Diego area serving over 2.3 million residents.

120

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in all of the samples processed at an average

121

concentration of 2,010,104 gene copies/L in the influent. Over the course of the study, the

122

clinically reported cases in the county increased by 29,375 (Fig. 1). Peaks in the wastewater

123

data were frequently followed by peaks in the clinically confirmed cases at a later date. This

124

suggests a correlation between wastewater and the number of new cases with the caveat of a

125

time delay, where the wastewater data predicts future trends in the new number of cases.

126

Although informative, this time-lagged correlation alone is not enough for robust predictions.

127

This served as the main motivation to build a predictive model for forecasting the number of

128

new cases per day in San Diego County. In order to model the number of new reported cases,

129

which correlates, not only to wastewater but other complex prevalence and spreading

130

dynamics, we embed useful predictors as separate time series to take advantage of any side

131

information that may improve our forecasting results. Here, the day of the week was tracked

132

for each data point in a third time series to capture any weekly trends for a total of three time

133

series with 88 data points each. We used a data-driven approach to train a prediction model

134

that utilizes prior reported cases, wastewater data and temporal correlations (embedded in the

135

day of the week) in order to forecast the number of new positive cases in San Diego County.

136

The multivariate Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model [7] was

137

applied to build a prediction model for the number of new positive cases. The (predicted)

138

number of new cases consist of lagged past values from all three series (number of new cases,

139

wastewater data, day of the week) and each term can be thought of as the influence of that

140

lagged time series on the number of new cases. 65 data points corresponding to data collected

141

from 07/07/2020 to 09/28/2020, were used for developing the predictive model and

142

forecasting estimates. The remaining 24 data points, corresponding to data collected from

143

09/29/2020 to 10/25/2020, were reserved for validating our forecast estimates. Fig. 2B shows

144

the results of the model (prediction and forecast) compared to the observed data. The Pearson

145

correlation coefficients and root mean squared error between the observed data and the

146

predicted model were r = 0.84, 0.79, 0.69, 0.47, RMSE = 57, 50, 59, 70 for the trained model,

147

1, 2 and 3 week advance forecast values respectively (Suppl. Table S2). Our data-driven

148

approach obtains forecasts successfully capturing general trends on the number of new cases

149

(shown here up to 3 weeks in advance), ultimately reinforcing that wastewater analysis can

150

be expository of previously undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population which

151

could provide useful insight for county officials for the purpose of early public health

152

interventions. As with most environmental samples, there are biases and caveats associated

153

with interpreting data from wastewater quantitatively, there are trade-offs while attempting to

154

scale-up the process to enable the screening of hundreds of samples on a daily basis with a

155

quick turn-around time. However, our data shows that we can still capture low prevalence

156

cases enabling studies at high spatial resolution. Our study demonstrates that high-throughput

157

wastewater-based surveillance can be successfully leveraged to enable creation of a rapid,

158

large-scale early alert system for counties/districts and could be particularly useful in

159

community surveillance in the more vulnerable populations.
