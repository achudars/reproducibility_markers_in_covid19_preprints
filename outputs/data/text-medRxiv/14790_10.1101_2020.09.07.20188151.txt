ABSTRACT

24

Background: Whether antibody levels measured by commercially-available enzyme or

25

chemiluminescent immunoassays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein can act

26

as a proxy for serum neutralizing activity remains to be established for many of these

27

assays.

28

Objectives: To evaluate the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies

29

(NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels

30

measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-

31

19 patients.

32

Patients and Methods: Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were

33

assayed by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2

34

IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and

35

the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays.

36

Results: Overall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the

37

highest agreement with the NtAb assay (κ, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive

38

tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay

39

(92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in

40

50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG

41

levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Rho=0.73) and

42

moderate for the remaining assays (Rho=0.48 to 0.59). The kinetic profile of serum

43

NtAb50 titers could not be reliably predicted by any of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG

44

immunoassays.

46

Conclusions: the suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for

47

inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies

48

widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of

49

symptoms.

1. Background

51

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a prototypical

52

Sarbecovirus, causes Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with

53

significant morbidity and mortality [1,2]. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NtAb)

54

presumably play a pivotal role in preventing infection and may promote virus clearance

55

[3,4]. In support of these assumptions, passive transfer of two mAbs blocking SARS-

56

CoV-2 interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme II receptor as monotherapy

57

protected rhesus macaques from infection [5]. Moreover, transfusion of plasma from

58

immune individuals with high NtAb titers seemed to be associated with improved

59

clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients [6,7]. Virus neutralization assays,

60

either using live native SARS-CoV-2 virus, engineered SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped

61

viruses or replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses [8-10] are cumbersome,

62

require specialized facilities, and are time consuming. A large number of enzyme-linked

63

(ELISA) or chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) detecting antibodies that bind

64

SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins have been commercialized [11]. Whether antibody

65

levels measured by these serological assays can be used as a proxy for serum

66

neutralizing activity is a relevant issue, which has been dealt with in several peer-

67

reviewed or preprint studies [12-20], but demands further investigations.

69

We focused on evaluating the degree of correlation between NtAb binding the SARS-

70

CoV-2 S protein, which is known to elicit the most potent antibodies for virus

71

neutralization [21,22], and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels measured by four commercially-

72

available semiquantitative immunoassays targeting the S protein in sera drawn from

73

hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

74

3. Study design

75

3.1. Serum specimens and patients

76

A total of 90 sera from 51 non-consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-

77

CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR [23,24] that were admitted to Hospital Clínico

78

Universitario of Valencia between March 5 to April 30, 2020, were included in the

79

current study. The Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of these patients are

80

displayed in Table 1. Forty-one sera were obtained within the first two weeks (< day 15)

81

after the onset of symptoms, at a median of 11 days (range, 5-14 days), and 49

82

afterward (≥ 15 days, at a median of 23 days; range, 15-41 days). Sequential specimens

83

were available from 20 out of the 51 patients (median 3 specimens per patient; range 2

84

to 6). This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hospital Clínico

85

Universitario INCLIVA (March 2020).

86

3.2. SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing antibody assay

87

A Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter-based pseudotyped virus neutralization

88

assay using a non-replicative vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV lacking the G protein)

89

backbone coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was used for neutralization

90

assays on Vero cells, as previously described [24]. Briefly, sera were heat-inactivated

91

for 30 minutes at 56°C then brought to an initial 10-fold dilution, followed by four 4-

92

fold dilutions in duplicate. Each dilution was mixed with an equal volume containing

93

1,250 plaque-forming units of the VSV-S virus and incubated at 37ºC for 1 h.

94

Subsequently, the mixture was added to Vero cells and incubated for 18 hours, after

95

which GFP expression was measured using a live cell microscope system (IncuCyteS3;

96

Sartorius). All sera which did not reduce viral replication by 50% at 1/20 dilution were

97

considered non-neutralizing and were arbitrarily assigned a value of 1/10. All sera that

98

did not result in >70% recovery of GFP signal at the highest antibody dilution were

99

retested using 5-fold dilutions ranging between 100 and 12,500-fold. Finally, the

100

antibody dilution resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) was calculated using

101

the drc package (version 3.0-1) in R via a 2 parameter logistic regression model (LL.2

102

model).

103

3.3. Commercial SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays

104

Four commercially-available semiquantitative immunoassays were used in the current

105

study. Performance and interpretation of results were done in accordance with the

106

respective manufacturer’s instructions. The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG

107

chemiluminescent assay (DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy) detects IgG antibodies

108

directed against a recombinant S protein (S1/S2). Samples displaying < 12.0 AU/mL are

109

considered negative, those ranging between 12.0 to 15.0 AU/mL are undetermined and

110

those > 15 AU/mL are deemed as positive. The Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA

111

(Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) uses a recombinant S1 domain of the S protein as a

112

target. Results are expressed as a ratio, calculated by dividing the optical densities of the

113

sample by those of an internal calibrator provided with the test kit. The cut-off index

114

(COI) for samples to be considered positive was ≥ 1.1 and inconclusive from 0.8 and

115

1.09. The MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG is an indirect CLIA for assessment of IgG

116

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins on the fully automated

117

MAGLUMI analyzers (SNIBE – Shenzhen New Industries Biomedical Engineering

118

Co., Ltd, Shenzhen, China). A test result ≥1.10 AU/mL is considered positive. The

119

COVID-19 ELISA IgG (Vircell Spain S.L.U., Granada, Spain) is an enzyme

120

immunoassay that detects IgGs targeting the S1 and N proteins. Sera displaying

121

antibody indices (AI) <1.4 are considered negative, those between 1.4 < 1.6

122

inconclusive, and those >1.6 positive. For all the assays, inconclusive results were

123

considered as positives for analysis purposes.

124

3.4. Definitions

125

Here, NtAb titers ≥1/160 were considered high as this is the minimum NtAb50 titer of

126

plasma from COVID-19 convalescent individuals recommended by the FDA for

127

therapeutic use [25]. Trajectories of antibody titers/levels were categorized as

128

ascendant, descendant, fluctuating, or constant. To this end, variations of antibody

129

levels >10% across sequential specimens were deemed to be relevant, as the intra-run

130

coefficient of variation was below this figure for all the immunoassays (all samples

131

from a given individual were assayed in the same run).

132

3.5. Statistical methods

133

Test performances were evaluated for their sensitivity with the associated 95%

134

confidence interval (CI). Cohen’s Kappa (κ) statistic was used to evaluate the

135

qualitative agreement between immunoassays. Spearman’s rank test was used to assess

136

the correlation between continuous variables using the entire dataset. To identify the

137

optimal SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels measured by commercial immunoassays predicting

138

NtAb50 titers ≥1/160, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was

139

performed. Two-sided exact P-values are reported, and a P-value <0.05 is considered

140

statistically significant. The analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS,

141

Chicago, IL, USA). Kinetics of antibody titers/levels were categorized as ascendant (an

142

increase of antibody levels >10% compared to previous sampling point), descendant

143

(any decrease), fluctuating, or constant.

144

4. Results

145

4.1. Patients characteristics

146

All 51 patients presented with pneumonia and imaging or laboratory findings

147

compatible with COVID-19 and were hospitalized in either the pneumology ward

148

(n=27) or the intensive care unit (ICU; n=24). As shown in Table 1, most patients (69%)

149

had one or more co-morbidities and displayed high serum levels of several pro-

150

inflammatory biomarkers at the time of serological testing. Four ICU patients

151

eventually died.

152

4.2. Agreement between NtAb and SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays results

153

Qualitative results returned by immunoassays were evaluated either considering the

154

entire data set or grouping sera according to the time of sampling after the onset of

155

symptoms (<15 days or ≥15 days) (Table 2). As shown in Table 3, overall, results

156

provided by the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test best matched those obtained with the NtAb

157

assay (κ, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.63-1), followed by those of the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG

158

ELISA (κ, 0.52; 0.52; 95% CI, 0.22-0.81), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (κ, 0.5;

159

95% CI, 0.2-0.78) and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG (0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.77). The same

160

trend was observed when sera collected either < 15 days or ≥ 15 days after the onset of

161

symptoms were analyzed separately. Notably, the concordance between results returned

162

by the NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG was 100% for sera obtained at ≥ 15

163

days following symptom onset.

164

4.3. The sensitivity of NtAb and SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays

165

Overall, the most sensitive tests were the GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus

166

neutralization assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG, followed by the MAGLUMI 2019-

167

nCoV IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA and the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2

168

S1/S2 IgG (Table 4). Differences in sensitivity were more apparent when sera were

169

collected early after the onset of symptoms (< 15 days) were analyzed independently,

170

and these tended to decrease in sera obtained at a later time point (Table 4).

171

4.4. Correlation between NtAb50 titers and IgG levels measured by SARS-CoV-2

172

IgG immunoassays

173

NtAb50 titers ranged from ≤1/20 (undetectable) to 1/12,500. As shown in Figure 1,

174

overall, the correlation between NtAb50 titers and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, as returned

175

by the corresponding immunoassay, was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG

176

ELISA (Rho=0.73) and moderate (Rho=0.48 to 0.59) for the remaining platforms. In all

177

instances, correlations were positive and statistically significant. The degree of

178

correlation between NtAb50 titers and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was substantially better

179

for sera collected within the first two weeks after the onset of symptoms (Rho=0.54-

180

0.80) than for those obtained afterward (Rho=0.30-0.52), irrespective of the commercial

181

immunoassay employed.

182

4.5. Inference of high NtAb50 titers by using SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays

183

Seventy-four out of 90 sera displayed high NtAb50 titers (≥1/160). ROC analysis was

184

performed to determine the IgG levels measured by commercial immunoassays that

185

predict NtAb50 titers of such a magnitude (Figure 2). Specificity was prioritized at the

186

expense of sensitivity for threshold selection. The data are shown in Table 5. The best

187

combination of specificity, sensitivity, and predictive values was achieved by the
8

188

LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG threshold, with minimal differences across the

189

remaining platforms.

190

4.6. Longitudinal follow-up of NtAb50 titers and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels measured

191

by immunoassays

192

We selected patients (n=11) with 3 or more sera available for kinetic studies. Kinetics of

193

NtAb50 titers and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels determined by commercial immunoassays

194

varied notably across patients and were dependent on the immunoassay considered.

195

Concordance between trajectories of NtAb50 titers and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was

196

highest when using the COVID-19 ELISA IgG (6 out of 11 patients) assay, followed by

197

MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG (5 out of 11), and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and

198

Euroimmun IgG (both 3 out of 11) assays. Representative cases of concordant and

199

discordant trajectories are depicted in Figure 3.

200

5. Discussion

201

A major role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and blunting virus spread in

202

COVID-19 patients is predicted for NtAb [3-5]. Quantitation of serum NtAb titers in

203

plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients is recommended for optimal selection of

204

specimens for passive transfer therapies; the FDA recommends the use of plasma with

205

NtAb50 levels ≥1/160 [22]. NtAb assays, either using SARS-CoV-2 strains, pseudotyped

206

viruses or chimeric viruses are technically demanding, require specialized facilities

207

(biosafety level 3 for live SARS-CoV-2 or level 2 for the pseudotyped viruses), and

208

cannot be implemented in routine practice. Thus, it is of interest to find alternative

209

methods to obtain reliable information regarding the neutralizing activity of sera that are

210

simple, fast, high-throughput assays, and commercially available. Here, we compared

211

the performance of a GFP reporter-based pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (VSV-

212

SARS-CoV-2 S) and four commercial immunoassays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S

213

protein for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and assessed the extent to which NtAb50 titers

214

and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels measured by these assays correlate. Prior studies assessing

215

this relationship have been published for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA and

216

LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG [12,13,15,18-20], but not, to the best of our

217

knowledge, for the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG and COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays. It

218

must be highlighted that antibody titers measured by the NtAb assay used in the current

219

study strongly correlate with those quantitated by assays using wild type SARS-CoV-2

220

[26].

221

Here, the overall agreement between qualitative (positive/negative) results returned by

222

the NtAb assay and the four commercially-available immunoassays was fairly good,

223

ranging from 97% for the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay to 88% for LIAISON SARS-

224

CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG assays. Concordance across results

225

was better for sera obtained at late times after the onset of symptoms (≥15 days), likely

226

reflecting the existence of differences in the kinetics of NtAb and SARS-CoV-2 IgG

227

levels measured by commercial immunoassays early after infection. In line with this

228

finding, the COVID-19 ELISA IgG performed comparably to the NtAb assay in terms

229

of overall sensitivity (92.2%), ranking first across the evaluated commercial

230

immunoassays. As previously reported, the sensitivity of all immunoassays increased

231

after the second week following the onset of symptoms [12,13,15,16, 18,19, 20]. The

232

overall degree of correlation between NtAb50 antibody titers and SARS-CoV-2 IgG

233

levels was strong for the Euroimmun IgG assay but low to moderate for the other

234

commercial immunoassays. The fact that the Euroimmun IgG assay detects antibodies

235

against S1, which contains the RBD domain and concentrates immunodominant

236

epitopes eliciting high-affinity NtAb antibodies [3,5,21,22] may account for this

237

finding. IgG antibodies lacking neutralizing activity and recognizing epitopes within S2

238

and N proteins (additional targets in the remaining immunoassays) may compete with

239

those binding S1, thus decreasing the degree of correlation. Interestingly, in all cases,

240

correlations were better for sera collected early after the onset of symptoms than for

241

those obtained at later times; in line with this, NtAb trajectory could not be inferred in a

242

large fraction of patients by sequentially monitoring SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels,

243

regardless of the commercial immunoassay used. However, threshold levels of IgGs

244

predicting high NtAb50 titers (≥1/160) with high specificity (93%) could be established

245

for all immunoassays, although sensitivities were overall poor.

246

In the absence of a reference panel of sera with standard levels of NtAb antibodies,

247

comparison across studies addressing the above issue is not straightforward, as the

248

biological characteristics of the neutralization assay, the timing of sera collection and

249

the clinical severity of COVID-19 patients differ notably between them and may explain

250

certain discrepancies. Namely, Weidner et al. [12] reported a strong correlation between

251

IgG levels measured by the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and NtAb50 titers

252

quantified by a wild type SARS-CoV-2 assay (Rho=0.75 versus Rho=0.59 in the current

253

study) in sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients. The degree of correlation reported

254

by Muecksh et al. [20] in a comparable population using an HIV pseudotyped platform

255

was even higher (Rho=0.82). Likewise, GeurtvanKessel et al. [13] found a strong

256

correlation (Rho=0.75) using a live SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assay and sera

257

from a mixed patient population in terms of COVID-19 severity. Despite the above-

258

highlighted differences across studies, our correlation data agree with those of Weidner

and NtAb50 titers quantified by using a live SARS-CoV-2 platform in sera obtained

>1/160, as determined by a SARS-CoV-2 wild type assay, was 92% when LIAISON

266

SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG levels were >80 AU/ml (90 AU/ml in the current study for a

267

positive predictive value of 98%). Also, in line with a previous report [20], the

268

trajectory of NtAb50 titers could not be predicted by assessing SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels

269

when measured by commercial immunoassays.

270

In summary, our data indicate that the reliability SARS-CoV-2 IgG commercial

271

immunoassays targeting the S protein to infer neutralizing activity against this protein in

272

sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests, and depends upon

273

the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms.
