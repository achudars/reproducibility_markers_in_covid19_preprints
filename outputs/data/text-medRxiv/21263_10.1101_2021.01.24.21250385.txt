Summary
Regular surveillance testing of asymptomatic individuals for SARS-CoV-2 has played a vital role in
SARS-CoV-2 outbreak prevention on college and university campuses. Here we describe the voluntary
saliva testing program instituted at the University of California, Berkeley during an early period of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in 2020. The program was administered as a research study ahead of clinical
implementation, enabling us to launch surveillance testing while continuing to optimize the assay.
Results of both the testing protocol itself and the study participants' experience show how the program
succeeded in providing routine, robust testing capable of contributing to outbreak prevention within a
campus community and offer strategies for encouraging participation and a sense of civic responsibility.

Introduction
Routine testing of individuals for the presence of viral genetic material is a central component of
pandemic control. At the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the United States, many colleges
and universities sought to implement testing procedures for campus communities to detect infectious
individuals not presenting COVID-19 symptoms. In March 2020, the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI)
at the University of California, Berkeley launched a high-complexity, Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory to perform clinical SARS-CoV-2 testing for both the campus
and surrounding local communities [1]. Initially, the lab developed and validated an automated, midturbinate-oropharyngeal swab-based RT-qPCR clinical assay to detect SARS-CoV-2. This laboratorydeveloped test (LDT) has provided high-throughput clinical testing that supports patients utilizing the
campus University Health Services (UHS) and multiple external community healthcare organizations.
In parallel with this effort, the IGI SARS-CoV-2 Testing Consortium designed and implemented an
asymptomatic surveillance testing program in summer 2020 to serve the essential facilities and
infrastructure staff, and researchers working on the University of California, Berkeley campus, as well
as undergraduate students who would return to the campus in the Fall. The program was administered
as a research study, enabling us to launch surveillance testing ahead of clinical implementation while
continuing to optimize our assay. Here, we provide an account of the steps taken to develop, launch,
and optimize the IGI Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (FAST) study. We describe our operational
successes and limitations, as well as feedback from participants. Together with a companion
methodology paper [2] describing the development and validation of the saliva test used for IGI FAST,
we provide a roadmap to launching an asymptomatic surveillance program on a university campus.

Results and Discussion
Saliva sample choice and study design
We reasoned that voluntary asymptomatic testing would be most effective if the sample collection was
simple, tolerable, inexpensive, did not require physical contact with healthcare workers, and could be
tested rapidly and robustly. Saliva presented an attractive solution that could meet these criteria. While
the exact sensitivity and specificity of saliva-based PCR tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
remain unclear, there was emerging evidence that saliva testing held a comparable performance to
nasopharyngeal swabs [3-8] when we began designing the diagnostic test and cognate research study
at the end of spring 2020.
We selected saliva as the sampling medium due to the ability to collect specimens amid a shortage of
nasopharyngeal swabs with minimal demand for trained personnel and personal protective equipment.
We designed and implemented a saliva specimen collection pipeline that minimized exposure risk and
maximized ease of use for participants. In parallel, we developed a high-throughput automated qPCRbased laboratory procedure for testing saliva for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material [2].
A stochastic branching process model [9] guided our asymptomatic surveillance parameters, including
testing frequency and turn-around-time (TAT). Since SARS-CoV-2 tests were a limited resource in the
San Francisco Bay Area, we sought to identify a surveillance regime that could effectively mitigate
asymptomatic spread while retaining an adequate capacity for more vulnerable populations or
medically indicated uses. Though there is an obvious association between higher testing frequency and
increased outbreak prevention, our model suggested that when viral prevalence is <1% in the
participating population, testing participants on alternating weeks with a TAT of no more than five days
could limit campus outbreaks. These parameters afforded the IGI Diagnostics Lab the ability to
continue allocating sufficient testing resources to highly vulnerable populations in the local community
while suppressing asymptomatic transmission within the campus community.
To test this model, optimize our assay, and bring surveillance testing to our campus, we established a
research study (IRB #2020-05-13336), known as IGI Free Asymptomatic Saliva Testing (IGI FAST). Of
those enrolled, 47% were recruited through a direct email invitation, 42% through word-of-mouth via a
friend/coworker, and 35% through invitations included in the clearance messages sent to campus
personnel who completed a daily online symptom screener required for on-site work (Figure 1a).
Interested individuals were directed to a custom-built online web application, where they provided
informed consent as well as demographic and contact information to facilitate communication and

follow-up should they test positive or inconclusive. Participants receiving a positive or inconclusive (only
one of three SARS-CoV-2 genes detected) result through this research study were directed to take a
follow-up swab-based confirmatory clinical test as soon as possible.

Figure 1: (A) Results from an exit survey question asking respondents to report through which methods they heard about IGI
FAST. Respondents (n=865) could select multiple answers. Abbreviations: IGI, Innovative Genomics Institute; UHS, University
Health Services; UCB, University of California, Berkeley. (B) Of the 4,825 participants who enrolled, 992 did not give any
samples, leaving 3,833 participants who gave 12,602 samples. A supply-chain shortage in week 11 caused a large number of
samples (94% of samples collected in week 11) to go untested. For this reason, all 631 samples collected at the beginning of
week 11 are excluded from the analysis of IGI FAST. One hundred eighty individuals only provided a sample during week 11,
so they are excluded from the analysis of IGI FAST, leaving a final cohort of 3,653 participants that gave 11,971 samples in
the studied weeks of IGI FAST.

IGI FAST study operating procedure
The IGI FAST study operated for a total of 16 weeks between June 23, 2020 and October 29, 2020 and
processed 11,971 tests (Supplementary data 1) from a total cohort of 3,653 active participants
(Figure 1b). For the first eight weeks of the study, one outdoor site operated at a campus location near
one cluster of research buildings that were the first to resume operations during the pandemic. For the
last eight active weeks of the study, an additional site provided expanded access to the on-campus
population. Both sites featured the same workflow (Figure 2) which we detail in Supplementary
Methods 1.
A custom-built IGI FAST web app allowed participants to schedule their saliva collection appointments.
Participants received a QR code that was presented and scanned at the testing site, allowing us to
rapidly locate participant records in the app. Participants received an SMS text and email reminder 30
minutes before their appointment. Participants were prompted to schedule appointments at a cadence
of every two weeks via email. The app uses TLS based encryption, an industry standard for web
security, with a Postgres database on top of an AES-256 encrypted filesystem on the backend. The

Figure 2: Our two testing sites followed the same workflow, which can be easily scaled to increase the throughput.
Participants first checked in at station one, where they were screened for COVID-19 symptoms, potential contacts, and recent
food or water consumption. At station 2, an appointment QR code was scanned, and a collection site worker created a test
requisition. Participants then went to individually-staffed spitting stations, where they were supervised while giving their
sample. At station 4, the tube was re-scanned, and participants confirmed their name and date of birth. At this point, the
sample was dropped into a bag and left with the site worker.

In the text and email reminders, participants were instructed not to eat, drink (including water), smoke,
chew gum, or brush their teeth for at least 30 minutes before their appointment slot, consistent with
instructions from the saliva collection kit manufacturer (DNA Genotek), and were asked to confirm this
upon arrival. Participants were screened verbally for COVID-19 symptoms or known exposure. Any
individuals reporting symptoms or exposure were instructed to go to UHS, where they were clinically
tested using a respiratory swab outside of the IGI FAST study's administration. Those who passed the
symptom and exposure screener then scanned their appointment QR code at the check-in desk. Here,
they were asked to confirm their name and date of birth. They then received a barcoded saliva
collection kit (OMNIgene OM-505).
To provide a saliva test specimen, the participant entered the saliva collection area, where they were
directed to an available kiosk staffed by "saliva coach" staff or volunteers who advised on the process
from behind a plastic divider. Coaching focused on safety and how to generate an optimal specimen.
Kiosk workers observed the saliva sample to check for visible food particles, excessive color (thought to
be due to substances such as coffee), excessive mucus, or excessive or insufficient volume (Appendix
1).
At the intake station (Station 4, Figure 2), participants scanned their tube into a Salesforce-platform
laboratory information management system built by Thirdwave Analytics [1] and left the tube with the
station worker. From here, the samples were brought back to the IGI Diagnostics Lab, where they
underwent the procedures outlined in [2].
We produced an instructional video to prepare participants in the test’s ongoing clinical deployment
(https://youtu.be/2IFB2Q-zV8g). (Note: This video records an IGI FAST test site worker going through
the workflow for demonstrative purposes – not for participation in the study).
To protect participants' and workers' safety, we collaborated with University of California, Berkeley's
Environmental Health & Safety department and UHS to implement several safeguards. First, we chose
to establish the two collection sites outdoors in covered, well-ventilated areas. Ground markings were
put in place to encourage social distancing as participants waited in line, and the spitting stations were
each separated by >12 feet to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the brief period while participants
were not wearing masks. Additionally, participants were scheduled to provide specimens at intervals
that would keep the density of people low. We established physical barriers between participants and
collection site workers in areas where participants were without masks, and a minimum of six feet of

distance elsewhere protected test site workers. Through this attention to safety for both the collection
site workers and the participants, we were able to minimize worker use of personal protective
equipment (PPE) while maximizing participant throughput.
On several occasions during the Fall, the Northern California Wildfires created hazardous
environmental conditions. If the air quality index, as determined by airnow.gov, was greater than 150 at
8 am on any day, the testing sites were closed, and participants were notified via email and SMS text
that no specimens would be collected that day.
Although the IGI FAST test results were not considered protected health information, we nonetheless
operated in alignment with HIPAA standards. Results were sent from the berkeley.edu-supported study
email address using end-to-end encryption from Virtru. Since these results were from a test yet to be
validated under the CLIA framework, we included specific language in the results describing this
limitation (Appendix 2). Participants with positive or inconclusive results were additionally contacted via
phone by one of the study clinicians. It became critical to quickly recommend isolation to these
individuals, follow up with confirmatory testing external to the study, and manage any symptoms that
may have emerged.
IGI FAST ended once the assay completed clinical validation as an LDT, obviating the need to
administer it as a research study. UHS assumed responsibility for asymptomatic surveillance sample
collection to consolidate surveillance sampling resources and personnel on the University of California,
Berkeley campus. While we continue to run the saliva test in our laboratory as a clinically orderable
test, it is currently deployed in a limited capacity, where its ease of use in a take-home setting better
suits low compliance or off-campus student populations.
Testing and participant characteristics
IGI FAST collected a total of 11,791 tests from its final cohort (Supplementary data 1). We identified
five positive samples from five different individuals through IGI FAST, within the expected range of 3.6
– 33.5 positives predicted by the estimated asymptomatic and presymptomatic prevalence of SARSCoV-2 infection in the City of Berkeley, CA during IGI FAST's duration (Table 1). While our tested
positivity rate falls within the expected range, it is on the lower end. This outcome could be attributable
to several factors, including test sensitivity; however, we speculate that it likely reflects a difference in
exposure risk between our study cohort and the broader population of the City of Berkeley. Overall, IGI

FAST featured a high number (n=761, 6.4%) of “specimen insufficient” results, making it a difficult test
to further scale through pooled testing [2].

asymptomatic and presymptomatic prevalence was computed by summing the estimated daily new infections per
100,000 output from the 'covidestim' package in R across the seven days of each week, dividing by a 700,000 person scaling
factor to produce the weekly incidence rate, then multiplying by a 14-day duration of infectiousness to derive prevalence (see
Methods). Finally, estimates were scaled by 40% to yield the asymptomatic and presymptomatic prevalence per week for the
duration of the study period.
bChitwood et al. fixed the lower bound of their 95% confidence intervals at the reported case positive rate (lagged by delay
time to presentation of symptoms). As a result, confidence intervals are not always evenly distributed (upper bounds exceed
lower bounds).
cThe asymptomatic and presymptomatic prevalence for the entire study duration (6/23/2020 - 8/30/2020 and 9/21/2020 10/29/2020) was computed similarly as the weekly asymptomatic and presymptomatic prevalence, but summed the estimated
daily new infections across the entire study duration, then followed the same steps.

Early on, the program confronted insufficient specimen rates up to 39% on a given collection day. In the
first three weeks of the program, 376 of the 1,417 (27%) total samples received a specimen insufficient

result. While aspects of the lab protocol were optimized to decrease the rate of specimen insufficient
results, 158 (42%) of the 376 insufficient specimens were due to protocol failure in a step before PCR,
such as an inability to pipette the sample.
Several established challenges with saliva collection may have contributed to this rejection rate.
Person-to-person variation in salivary flow, pH, and oral hygiene can contribute to notable
heterogeneity in specimen quality [10]. Additionally, several commonly used drugs for hypertension,
depression, allergies, pain, inflammation, and recreational use are negatively associated with saliva
production, which may lead to repeated sample rejection or difficult sampling for select individuals [11].
However, we suspected that factors like postnasal drip, improper sample volumes, or contaminants
from food or drink significantly contributed to our high sample rejection rate. Accordingly, we
established a communication line between the lab and collection site workers to improve coaching and
establish more careful on-site sample screening. Together with optimization of the assay in the lab, the
more stringent quality control steps occurring at the collection site decreased the specimen insufficient
rate from 27% in the first three weeks to 1.8% in the last three weeks (Figure 3a).
These changes also improved the TAT for results. Throughout the study, the mean (standard deviation)
TAT decreased from 72.6 (68.8) hours in the first three weeks (n=1,417) of the study to 45.9 (19.6)
hours in the last three weeks (n=2,665) of the study (Figure 3b).
The characteristics of our study population are described in Table 2. Overall, 4,825 participants
enrolled, with 992 individuals who never gave a specimen and 180 who completed an appointment only
during week 11's supply chain shortage, which are not included in the final cohort of 3,653 (Figure 1b).

IGI-FAST participant experience assessed by survey
All individuals enrolled in IGI FAST by October 20, 2020 were invited via email to take a 15-minute
anonymous exit survey in Qualtrics (Appendix 3), including those who never made an appointment. A
total of 903 (19%) (Table 3) participants completed at least one question on the survey. Race and
ethnicity data (Table 4) were collected on the exit survey, but not during original testing enrollment.
This survey collected data on demography, housing characteristics, behaviors associated with SARSCoV-2 exposure risk, experiences with IGI FAST, and preferences related to surveillance testing. It also
solicited general impressions in the form of the question, "If you had the opportunity to give advice to
another university setting up SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing, what are some suggestions you would
give?" Selected excerpts from responses to this question are provided in the next section.

Key results from the IGI FAST participant survey
1. Convenience is critical.
"I could walk out of my building, do my test, and be back in [the] lab in a matter of 10
minutes." – Graduate/professional student
As a voluntary testing program, we focused heavily on making IGI FAST easy to participate in and
widely appealing. Ease of enrollment, quick appointment scheduling, and testing sites' location were
paramount. Appointment scheduling could be completed well under one minute on the study’s web
application. The workflow (Figure 2) was kept as streamlined as possible on-site. While saliva collection
duration was variable, we endeavored to supply sufficient kiosks and coaches to keep the site's total
time to under ten minutes. Our locations were chosen, in part, based on their proximity to buildings with
high concentrations of on-site personnel – 82% of survey respondents that were approved to work on
campus worked within ten minutes of an IGI FAST testing site. Survey responses emphasized the
importance of this choice and minimizing travel time, where 58% of exit survey respondents indicated
that they would no longer participate if they had to travel longer than ten minutes from their workspace
to get to a testing site (Figure 4).

Figure 4: IGI FAST aimed to select testing sites on the University of California, Berkeley campus (A) near the buildings with
the highest occupancy levels during the pandemic. Here, we represent occupancy based on answers given during enrollment.
Residence halls and off-campus buildings are not depicted; neither are participants who did not report any building.
Participants who provided a primary campus building were presumed to be approved to work in those buildings during the
pandemic in this illustration. Participants who reported multiple campus buildings are counted multiple times in this illustration.
(B) Overall, 82% of survey respondents who were approved to work on campus indicated that they worked within 10 minutes
of the nearest testing site, excluding those who did not answer this question on the survey (n=650). (C) When asked how long
they would be willing to travel for regular surveillance testing, most survey respondents reported that they would be willing to
travel six or more minutes for testing; however, many participants would be lost to travel times greater than ten minutes
(n=635).

Specimen collection procedures in IGI FAST were well-tolerated and viewed as easy by participants
(Figure 5). When asked to compare experiences with SARS-CoV-2 tests received elsewhere, 79%
(409 out of 515) of those that received a respiratory swab reported that the IGI FAST saliva test was
more tolerable (Figure 5a). While there is a strong preference for saliva over clinician-administered
respiratory swabs, our exit survey indicates that a switch to self-administered nasal swabs would not
significantly affect participation rates. As one graduate student participant commented in the exit
survey, "...the self-administered nasal swabs are a pain and make me not want to go as much, though
[I will] probably put up with [them anyway]." Only 2% of survey respondents indicated that they would
not participate in a surveillance program using a self-administered nasal swab, while 86% indicated that
they would participate in such a program, and an additional 12% were unsure (Figure 5c). Additionally,
IGI FAST received high scores for ease and safety (Figure 5b). Taking our data together, convenience
is the most critical determinant of participation, suggesting that, if made as convenient as FAST, a
voluntary nasal swab-based asymptomatic surveillance program is likely to see high participation rates.

Figure 5: IGI FAST was well-reviewed by participants. (A) To exit survey respondents who reported having done a respiratory
swab-based SARS-CoV-2 test outside of IGI FAST (n=515), IGI FAST was superior regarding tolerability and convenience. (B)
When exit survey participants were asked how well various words described their experiences with the IGI FAST test, testing
sites, or personnel, IGI FAST received favorable responses. (C) When asked whether participants would continue participating
in a testing program using a nasal swab instead of IGI FAST, most respondents indicated a willingness to continue
participation (n=839). Of note, this question specified the hypothetical continued program would use nasal swabs instead of
nasopharyngeal swabs, clarifying the difference between the two.

2. Saliva presents challenges but should not be ignored as an option.
"I really like[d] that IGI FAST used saliva collection instead of a nasal swab and found it
much more comfortable than the [self-administered nasal swab] test." – Undergraduate
student
Throughout the FAST study, we identified several challenges with saliva-based testing for SARS-CoV2. First, it requires advanced planning by the participants to ensure that they do not eat, drink, smoke,
chew gum, or brush their teeth within 30 minutes before their appointment times. While there is limited
research on the subject [12], this guidance is typical of saliva kit manufacturers' instructions to prevent
interference with the abundance of buccal cell DNA or populations of oral viruses and microbes.
Second, we suspect that either natural variability [10], drug- or disease-induced xerostomia [11], or
participant hydration status affected the viscosity of samples collected, leading to high variability in
sample quality. We found saliva to be a challenging matrix for nucleic acid extraction in general and
observed that viscous samples were often more likely to fail, leading to a high specimen insufficient
rate. These technical issues are further discussed in our companion manuscript [2], and made the
possibility of pooling to increase surveillance capacity impractical, a strategy we were able to test by
virtue of operating under an IRB rather than as a clinical requisition. Third, 20% of survey respondents
indicated that producing a sufficient amount of saliva was either "somewhat difficult" or "extremely
difficult." However, 33% of respondents with two or more visits indicated that they developed a saliva
sampling strategy, indicating a possible learning curve. The most common strategies included building
a "reserve" of saliva while waiting in line by not swallowing (41% of those with strategies), hydrating
well before the test (36%), and thinking about food during the test (12%).
Despite these challenges, saliva as a sample type retains certain advantages over respiratory swabs.
As spitting is a non-technical procedure, saliva samples are particularly amenable to at-home selfcollection. Collecting saliva also presents an alternative for populations who are particularly intolerant to
respiratory swabs and circumvents shortages in respiratory swab supply chains. To further explore its
potential to better reach low-participation populations, the IGI has partnered with UHS to continue a
smaller-scale take-home pilot using the now clinically-validated saliva-based assay developed during
IGI FAST. To go along with this pilot, IGI has created resources such as video
(https://youtu.be/FRuAcLJm5zk) and written (Appendix 4) instructional materials for use at home.
Given that saliva tests appear to have comparable performance to nasopharyngeal swab tests for
SARS-CoV-2 [13, 14], expanding deployment beyond asymptomatic surveillance into some clinical
populations may be warranted. In fact, there is emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 titer in saliva may
be a helpful biomarker for risk stratification and prognosis [15].

3. Establish regular testing as a social norm.
"Create a climate where an employee sees it as something to do for their coworkers[,]
not as a threat to their continued employment..." – Non-academic research staff member
Given that participation was entirely voluntary and no compensation was given, our successful
enrollment of 3,653 active participants (Figure 6a) indicates a demand for, rather than resistance to
surveillance testing in general. Indeed, a study at the University of California, Berkeley immediately
preceding IGI FAST [16] supports our findings that creating attitudes of civic engagement and
camaraderie surrounding surveillance testing may render mandates unnecessary. Overall, the reasons
for joining IGI FAST indicated in the exit survey were typically elective rather than imposed (Figure 6b
– c). Of the respondents who were approved to work on the University of California, Berkeley campus
at any time during IGI FAST, 90% reported that they either preferred or did not feel safe working unless
they and their coworkers got regular viral testing.
We endeavored to cultivate a positive culture surrounding surveillance testing through messaging
strategies and testing site atmosphere. Training efforts with IGI FAST personnel focused on creating a
welcoming, respectful environment for participants (Figure 5). A specific effort to promote positive
messaging surrounding surveillance testing featured a series of stickers produced by IGI (Figure 6d).
While subtle, the stickers provided a mode of civic signaling akin to the "I voted" stickers that increase
voter turnout in elections by evoking conformity bias [17]. One undergraduate survey respondent
reported that the "...stickers started a movement of sorts within my house and I felt a sense of pride
getting tested." Some participants even reported an effort to collect all sticker designs across their
visits. We conclude that with appropriate messaging and atmosphere, surveillance testing for SARSCoV-2 can quickly become a social norm and even be perceived as a civic duty.
4. Establish a robust communication system.
"Work with a [communications professional to] write, edit and design your
communication materials. We are [drowning] in information, which is changing daily and
it does not help if we have to wade through […] communication." – Healthcare worker
IGI FAST aimed to communicate regularly and clearly with study participants. By creating a website
solely dedicated to testing through IGI FAST, participants had an easily accessible, coherent resource
to understand how to participate in the program, access appointments, and view announcements with
program updates. Collaboration with UHS enabled individuals who had provided positive or
inconclusive samples to promptly receive clinical testing. Furthermore, an automated notification

system enabled participants to receive prompts to schedule appointments and reminders about
upcoming appointments, including reminders to avoid eating or drinking before their appointment via
email and SMS text.

Figure 6: (A) There were two waves of enrollment into the study – at the beginning of the study and again in the Fall when
undergraduate students returned to the city for the beginning of the academic year. There was a wide variety of participation
levels in the program. Here, participation rate represents the number of samples an individual gave divided by the number of
possible appointments that individual could have made based on when they joined. The graphs here depict only active
participants in the final cohort (n=3,653). (B) The leading reasons for joining IGI FAST were elective (i.e., participants wanted
regular viral testing, wanted to contribute to research, or had encouragement from friends/family/coworkers). 79% of the 865
respondents who completed this question reported more than one reason. (C) The majority (77%) of the total (n=865)
participants reported solely elective reasons for joining IGI FAST. Few (1%) reported imposed or "one-off" reasons (i.e., worry
about COVID-19 exposure or symptoms, pressure from others, requirement or pressure from employer/boss/supervisor, the
fulfillment of travel requirements). One individual was excluded from this analysis because their response was unclassifiable.
(D) Examples of stickers produced to facilitate the normalization of surveillance testing on campus through cultivating a sense
of pride.

Future improvements to the testing program could include faster dissemination of results, both to
participants and the campus health service, which could be achieved by enhancing the study web app
to include a results portal. Other enhancements to the web app could include centralizing resources for
contact tracing, symptom screening, and clear, digestible guidance on best practices for social

behavior, mask-wearing, and use of asymptomatic testing results. Universities should aim to centralize
all resources related to pandemic response and testing and be transparent regarding policies and
procedures to minimize stigmatization surrounding positive results.
5. Risk-stratification is helpful but should be comprehensive.
In a limited-resource setting, campuses benefit from developing a risk-stratification paradigm to
determine cost-effective test allocation models. Many campus surveillance efforts have focused on
undergraduate students living in administratively defined congregate housing (i.e., dormitory residents,
those living in Greek or co-operative housing) and actively training or competing student-athletes.
Exposure and transmission risk-stratification can be further optimized by considering additional factors,
including 'off-campus' housing density and outside work activities. For example, 14% of undergraduate
survey respondents (n=115) live in private households or apartments with greater than five other
people, and 5% of graduate student survey respondents who are approved to work on campus live with
someone who works or volunteers in healthcare settings or nursing homes. Notably, some participants
were concerned about self-isolating should they test positive. Only 50% of graduate/professional
students (n=250) reported that they could "probably" or "definitely" effectively self-isolate in response to
a positive test result. A brief questionnaire to collect baseline data such as housing characteristics, risks
associated with housemate occupation, childcare/school attendance, ability to self-isolate, or
housemate susceptibility to adverse health outcomes could be deployed to allocate resources to the
campus population more effectively. Continued brief questionnaires may further refine the model of
resource allocation to assess factors such as social behavior, travel, changes in occupational risk, or
even emergence of symptoms [16]. Doing so would layer adaptive risk-stratification onto a baseline
risk-stratification paradigm to ensure adequate resource allocation longitudinally.

Conclusion
During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, higher education institutions have been faced with difficult choices
in their effort to retain some activity while safeguarding their campus and local communities. While
many challenges are universal, Universities present some unique risks of spread both within their
campus and outside to local communities stemming from student travel between campus and their
home locales, engagement in high-contact student athletics, high-density living spaces [18, 19], and a
culture of highly social behavior. For these reasons, universities that choose to maintain some inperson activities have an obligation to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through a robust disease
prevention ecosystem. Here we describe a blueprint for a low-barrier, safe, effective, easy, and

adaptable program for campus SARS-CoV-2 surveillance using saliva specimens capable of preventing
outbreaks and effectively creating a culture of safety.
Universities have an opportunity to lead with institutional responses to crises. Campus responses to
SARS-CoV-2 have had the opportunity to serve as a paragon of effective utilization of academics with
expertise in the life sciences, public health, technology, public policy, social psychology, education, and
communications. We hope that the outcomes and lessons from IGI FAST will help other institutions
implement successful strategies or improve their responses in the face of SARS-CoV-2 and assist with
future pandemic preparedness.

Methods
Enrollment and participation
Participants were recruited via email, social media posts, flyers on the University of California, Berkeley
campus, word of mouth, campus website postings, and announcements connected to the required
campus symptom screening tool. Participants could enroll at any point between June 19, 2020 and
October 20, 2020. Enrollment criteria included being at least 18 years of age and affiliation to the
University of California, Berkeley campus. Initially, participation was limited to individuals formally
approved to work on campus or buildings affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley (e.g.,
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) as essential workers, including individuals such as visiting
scholars, contractors, or regulatory officials who are not formally employees of the University of
California, Berkeley but regularly conducted business on campus. This requirement was relaxed in
August to allow any individual affiliation to the University of California, Berkeley to enroll, including
undergraduate students living off-campus and employees working remotely. Informed consent and
enrollment were completed on the IGI FAST web application. Informed consent, flyers, and the study
information sheet were available in English and Spanish.
A total of 4,825 participants enrolled in the study; however, 992 did not complete any appointments. A
total of 12,602 tests were collected through IGI FAST. From weeks 11-13 of the study (August 31September 20), there was a pause in study sample collection due to a supply chain shortage of liquid
handler pipette tips [2]. Six hundred thirty-one samples were collected during week 11 before the
appointment cancellations. Because the majority (n=586, 93%) of the samples collected during week
11 were affected by the shortage and were unable to be tested, all requisitions from this week are
excluded from the analyses we present. These exclusion criteria for our analysis leave a final total of

11,971 tests coming from a cohort of 3,653 participants with at least one test in weeks 1-10 and 14-19
of the study.
Exit survey
All individuals enrolled in the study, except for 13 that withdrew from communications, were requested
to take a 15-minute-long exit survey in Qualtrics. The invitation to complete the survey was included in
the announcement that IGI FAST would be closing on October 20, 2020 and was available through
November 2, 2020. This survey did not solicit identifiable information and was uncoupled from
participants' test results. Participants were instructed to skip any questions they did not wish to answer;
however, of the total 903 (100%) (Table 3) participants that answered at least one question, 847 (94%)
completed the whole survey. Because participants could skip questions, and many questions were
shown conditionally, we provide sample size on a per-question basis throughout our results here. A text
version of the survey is available in Appendix 3.
Analysis of testing rates
We sought to compare the results of IGI FAST to expected frequencies based on the estimated
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the City of Berkeley. To estimate the City of Berkeley's
background SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across the duration of IGI FAST, we relied on the 'covidestim' R
package developed by Chitwood et al. [20]. We used this package to analyze daily reported COVID-19
cases, deaths, and test positivity rates across the duration of the epidemic for the City of Berkeley, CA
(https://data.cityofberkeley.info); the package uses a Bayesian statistical approach and an underlying
SIR mechanistic model to infer true infection rates (including asymptomatic) from those reported. The
model outputs the estimated true daily infections per 100,000 persons with an upper and lower
confidence interval. We then inferred prevalence from these estimated incidence rates as the daily
incidence rate multiplied by the duration of infection in days. While an individual infected with SARSCoV-2 may test positive for more than 21 days [21-23], we used 14 days for this estimate of
prevalence, reflective of the pathogen's infectious period [24]. This calculation yielded the estimated
true prevalence of infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection per day in our community. We assumed
that 40% of this estimated prevalence was composed of asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals
[25, 26].
Given that symptomatic individuals were instructed to seek testing at a clinic, we then multiplied the
estimated true prevalence (and corresponding confidence intervals) by 40% to yield a daily prevalence
of asymptomatic/presymptomatic infections. Finally, we multiplied this asymptomatic/presymptomatic
prevalence by the total number of tests collected by IGI FAST each day to determine the expected
20

number of positives per day (Supplementary Data 1). To compute the estimated asymptomatic and
presymptomatic prevalence and expected number of positives across the study duration, we summed
the expected number of true infections per day and divided these infections by a 700,000-person
scaling factor to compute mean incidence. We then multiplied this incidence rate by the 14-day duration
of infection and the 40% asymptomatic/presymptomatic proportion to derive the mean weekly
prevalence of asymptomatic/presymptomatic infection. We replicated this approach for the upper and
lower confidence interval estimates of infection. To derive mean asymptomatic/presymptomatic
prevalence across the study's duration, we applied the same approach but summed estimated cases
across the entire study period, divided by 100,000 persons per day multiplied by the total number of
days in the study.
