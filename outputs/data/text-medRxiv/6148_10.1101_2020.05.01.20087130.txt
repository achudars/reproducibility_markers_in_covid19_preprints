Abstract

45
46

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a

47

global pandemic by the World Health Organisation and urgent treatment and prevention strategies

48

are needed. Many clinical trials have been initiated with existing medications, but assessments of

49

the expected plasma and lung exposures at the selected doses have not featured in the prioritisation

50

process. Although no antiviral data is currently available for the major phenolic circulating

51

metabolite of nitazoxanide (known as tizoxanide), the parent ester drug has been shown to exhibit in

52

vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nitazoxanide is an anthelmintic drug and its metabolite tizoxanide

53

has been described to have broad antiviral activity against influenza and other coronaviruses. The

54

present study used physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to inform optimal doses

55

of nitazoxanide capable of maintaining plasma and lung tizoxanide exposures above the reported

56

nitazoxanide 90% effective concentration (EC90) against SARS-CoV-2.

57

Methods: A whole-body PBPK model was constructed for oral administration of nitazoxanide and

58

validated against available tizoxanide pharmacokinetic data for healthy individuals receiving single

59

doses between 500 mg – 4000 mg with and without food. Additional validation against multiple-

60

dose pharmacokinetic data when given with food was conducted. The validated model was then

61

used to predict alternative doses expected to maintain tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations

62

over the reported nitazoxanide EC90 in >90% of the simulated population. Optimal design software

63

PopDes was used to estimate an optimal sparse sampling strategy for future clinical trials.

64

Results: The PBPK model was validated with AAFE values between 1.01 – 1.58 and a difference less

65

than 2-fold between observed and simulated values for all the reported clinical doses. The model

66

predicted optimal doses of 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID, 2900 mg BID in the fasted state and 700 mg

67

QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID when given with food, to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung

68

concentrations over the reported in vitro EC90 of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2. For BID regimens

69

an optimal sparse sampling strategy of 0.25, 1, 3 and 12h post dose was estimated.

70

Conclusion: The PBPK model predicted that it was possible to achieve plasma and lung tizoxanide

71

concentrations, using proven safe doses of nitazoxanide, that exceed the EC90 for SARS-CoV-2. The

72

PBPK model describing tizoxanide plasma pharmacokinetics after oral administration of nitazoxanide

73

was successfully validated against clinical data. This dose prediction assumes that the tizoxanide

74

metabolite has activity against SARS-CoV-2 similar to that reported for nitazoxanide, as has been

75

reported for other viruses. The model and the reported dosing strategies provide a rational basis for

76

the design (optimising plasma and lung exposures) of future clinical trials of nitazoxanide in the

77

treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

79
80

COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

81

CoV-2) with noticeable symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and difficulty in breathing. There are

82

currently no effective treatment or prevention options and it has become a global health problem

83

with more than 3.1 million cases and over 217,000 deaths as of 29th April 2020 [1]. Urgent strategies

84

are required to manage the pandemic and the repurposing of already approved medicines is likely to

85

bring options forward more quickly than full development of potent and specific antivirals. Antiviral

86

drugs may have application prior to or during early infection, but may be secondary to

87

immunological interventions in later stages of severe disease [2].

88
89

Although new chemical entities (NCEs) are likely to have high potency and specificity for SARS-CoV-2,

90

full development is time consuming, costly and attrition in drug development is high [3, 4]. Drug

91

repurposing, where existing or investigational drugs could be used outside the scope of their original

92

indication may present a rapid alternative to new drug development. Several examples of successful

93

repurposing exist, including the use of the anti-angiogenic drug thalidomide for cancer and the use

94

of mifepristone for Cushing’s disease after initially being approved for termination of early

95

pregnancy [5, 6].

96
97

SARS-CoV-2 targets the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are present in high

98

density on the outer surface of lung cells. Lungs are the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and

99

infection is usually initiated in the upper respiratory tract [7]. Symptoms that result in neurological,

100

renal and hepatic dysfunction are also emerging due to the expression of ACE2 receptors in these

101

organs [8-11]. Therefore, therapeutic concentrations of antiviral drugs are likely to be needed in the

102

upper airways for treatment and prevention of infection, but sufficient concentrations are also likely

103

to be required systemically for therapy to target the virus in other organs and tissues.

104
105

The scale at which antiviral activity of existing medicines are being studied for potential repurposing

106

against SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented [12]. The authors recently reported a holistic analysis which

107

benchmarked reported in vitro activity of tested drugs against previously published pharmacokinetic

108

exposures achievable with their licenced doses [13]. Importantly, this analysis demonstrated that the

109

majority of drugs that have been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity are unlikely to achieve the

110

necessary concentrations in the plasma after administration of their approved doses. While this

111

analysis is highly influenced by the drugs selected for analysis to date and highly sensitive to the

112

accuracy of the reported antiviral activity data, a number of candidate agents were identified with

113

plasma exposures above the reported EC50/EC90 against SARS-CoV-2.

114
115

One such drug, nitazoxanide, is a thiazolide antiparasitic medicine used for the treatment of

116

cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis that cause diarrhoea [14, 15], and also has reported activity against

117

anaerobic bacteria, protozoa and other viruses [16]. Importantly, rapid deacetylation of nitazoxanide

118

in blood means that the major systemic species of the drug in vivo is tizoxanide, which has not yet

119

been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Notwithstanding, tizoxanide has been shown to exhibit

120

similar in vitro inhibitory activity to nitazoxanide for rotaviruses [17], hepatitis B and C viruses [18,

121

19], other coronaviruses, noroviruses [20] and influenza viruses [21, 22]. As another respiratory

122

virus, previous work on influenza may be useful to gain insight into the expected impact of

123

nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the drug has been shown to selectively block the

124

maturation of the influenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein at the post-translational stage [22, 23] and a

125

previous phase 2b/3 trial demonstrated a reduction in symptoms and viral shedding at a dose of 600

126

mg BID compared to placebo in patients with uncomplicated influenza [24]. Other potential benefits

127

of nitazoxanide in COVID-19 may derive from its impact upon the innate immune response that

128

potentiates the production of type 1 interferons [25, 26] and bronchodilation of the airways through

129

inhibition of TMEM16A ion channels [27]. A clinical trial (NCT04341493) started on April 6th 2020 and

130

aims to evaluate the activity of 500 mg BID nitazoxanide alone or in combination with the 4-

131

aminoquinoline hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 [28]. However, there are currently no data

132

within the public domain to support this dose selection for COVID-19. Nitazoxanide is relatively safe

133

in humans and studies showed tolerability of single oral doses up to 4 g with minimal

134

gastrointestinal side effects. Plasma concentrations of tizoxanide have demonstrated dose

135

proportionality, but administration in the fed state increases the plasma exposure [29]. Thus, the

136

drug is recommended for administration with food.

137
138

Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling is a computational tool that integrates

139

human physiology and drug disposition kinetics using mathematical equations to inform the

140

pharmacokinetic exposure using in vitro and drug physicochemical data [30]. The aim of this study

141

was to validate a PBPK model for tizoxanide following administration of nitazoxanide. Once validated

142

this model was first used to assess the plasma and lung exposures estimated to be achieved during a

143

previous trial for uncomplicated influenza. Next, different nitazoxanide doses and schedules were

144

simulated to identify those expected to provide tizoxanide plasma and lung trough concentrations

145

(Ctrough) above the reported nitazoxanide SARS-CoV-2 EC90 in the majority (>90%) of patients.

Methods

147
148

A whole-body PBPK model consisting of compartments to represent select organs and tissues was

149

developed. Nitazoxanide physiochemical and drug-specific parameters used in the PBPK model were

150

obtained from literature sources as outlined in Table 1. The PBPK model was assumed to be blood-

151

flow limited, with instant and uniform distribution in each tissue or organ and no reabsorption from

152

the large intestine. Since the data is computer generated, no ethics approval was required for this

153

study.

Model development

One hundred virtual healthy adults (50% women, aged 20-60 years between 40-120 kg) were

162

simulated. Patient demographics such as weight, BMI and height were obtained from CDC charts

163

[37]. Organ weight/volumes and blood flow rates in humans were obtained from published

164

literature sources [38, 39]. Transit from the stomach and small intestine was divided into seven

165

compartments to capture effective absorption kinetics as previously described [40]. Tissue to plasma

166

partition ratio of drug and drug disposition across various tissues and organs were described using

167

published mathematical equations [41-43]. Effective permeability (Peff) in humans was scaled from

Model validation

177

The PBPK model was validated against available clinical data in healthy individuals in the fed and

178

fasted state for various single oral doses of nitazoxanide ranging from 500 mg to 4000 mg [29, 46],

179

and for multiple dosing at 500 mg and 1000 mg BID with food. Nitazoxanide absorption was

180

considered using the available apparent permeability data (shown in table 1) and tizoxanide was

181

assumed to form as soon as the drug reached systemic circulation as metabolic studies have shown

182

it takes just six minutes for complete conversion into the active circulating metabolite, with no trace

183

of nitazoxanide detected in plasma [47]. Therefore, tizoxanide parameters were used to define drug

184

disposition. The model was assumed to be validated if: 1) the absolute average fold error (AAFE)

185

between the observed and the simulated plasma concentrations - time curve of tizoxanide was less

186

than two; and 2) the simulated pharmacokinetic parameters - maximum concentration (Cmax), area

187

under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Ctrough (trough concentration at the end of the

188

dosing interval) were less than two-fold from the mean observed values.

189
190

Model simulations

191

The pharmacokinetics following administration of 600 mg BID as reported in a previous phase 2b/3

192

clinical trial of nitazoxanide in uncomplicated influenza [24] were first simulated and plotted relative

193

to the average of previously reported influenza EC90s [48, 49] for strains(as shown in supplementary

194

table 1) included in the previous trials. This was done to assess the exposure relative to in vitro

195

activity for an indication where clinical benefit was already demonstrated.

196
197

For potential SARS-CoV-2 applications, several oral dosing regimens were simulated for BID, TID or

198

QID administration in the fasted state. Antiviral activity data from Wang et al. [50] were digitised

199

using Web Plot Digitiser® software and used to calculate a nitazoxanide EC90 for SARS-CoV-2 of 4.64

200

µM (1.43 mg/L). Optimal doses were identified such that the concentration at 12 hours post-first

201

dose (C12) for BID, 8 hours post-first dose (C8) for TID, or 6 hours post-first dose (C6) for QID

202

administration were over the recalculated EC90 for nitazoxanide. Plasma and lung tizoxanide

203

exposures at these doses and schedules are reported in addition to plasma-time curves. The doses

204

were optimised using tizoxanide parameters and pharmacokinetics, however, the doses were

205

reported for nitazoxanide.

206
207

Optimal pharmacokinetic sampling

208

Clinical trials should incorporate PK sampling to confirm tizoxanide plasma exposures, and further

209

validate the predictions from the PBPK model. Optimal sparse pharmacokinetic timepoint selection

210

(assuming 4 blood samples per patient, and 40 patients in the study) were made on the basis of the

211

prior fed PK data of Stockis et al. [29, 46]. Tizoxanide plasma PK data in fed patients from Stockis et

212

al. was fitted with an empirical one compartment disposition model, with first-order absorption and

213

absorption transit compartment, and the parameters from this fitting were used (with nominal %CV

214

interindividual variability in the PK parameters of 30%) in the optimal design software PopDes

215

(University of Manchester Version 4.0) to generate the suggested optimal sampling timepoints [51,

216

52].

219

Model validation

220

The PBPK model validation against various fasted oral doses is shown in supplementary Figure 1 and

221

the validation against single and multiple doses in the fed state is shown in supplementary Figure 2.

222

The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax and Ctrough) are presented in Table 2a and

223

2b. The AAFE values for the validated doses ranged between 1.01 – 1.55 for fasted state and

224

between 1.1 – 1.58 for fed state indicating a close match between observed and simulated data. The

225

ratio between the simulated and the observed pharmacokinetic parameters – AUC, Cmax and Ctrough

226

was between 0.81 – 1.54 (Table 2a) for fasted state and between 0.67 – 2.15 for fed state. The PBPK

227

model simulated tizoxanide plasma concentrations were within acceptable ranges and therefore the

228

PBPK model was assumed to be validated.

229

Model simulations

230

Figure 1a and 1b show the simulated plasma and lung exposures relative to the average influenza

231

EC90 after administration of 600 mg BID dose of nitazoxanide with food as reported in the previous

232

phase 2b/3 trial in uncomplicated influenza [24]. These simulations indicate that all patients were

233

predicted to have plasma and lung tizoxanide Ctrough (C12) concentrations below the average EC90 (8.4

234

mg/L, supplementary table 1) [49], but that 71% and 14% were predicted to have plasma and lung

235

Cmax concentrations respectively above the average EC90 for influenza, respectively.

236
237

Figure 2a and 2b shows the prediction of trough concentrations in plasma and lung for the different

238

simulated doses and schedules in healthy individuals for fasted and fed states, respectively. Doses

239

and schedules estimated to provide plasma Ctrough concentrations over 1.43 mg/L for at least 50% of

240

the simulated population were identified. However, lower doses in each schedule (i.e. 800 mg QID,

241

1300 mg TID and 1800 mg BID in fasted state and 500 mg QID, 700 mg TID, 1100 mg BID in fed state)

242

were predicted to result in >40% of the simulated population having lung Ctrough below the SARS-CoV-

243

2 EC90. Optimal doses for SARS-CoV-2 in the fasted state were predicted to be 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg

244

TID, 2900 mg BID and in the fed state were 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID and 1400 mg BID. Figure 3

245

shows the plasma and lung concentrations for the optimal doses and schedules in fed state and

246

supplementary figure 3 shows the plasma concentration – time profile of optimal doses in fasted

247

state. Tizoxanide concentrations in lung and plasma were predicted to reach steady state in <48

248

hours, both in the fasted and fed state.

Discussion

288

Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has become a major global healthcare challenge with no well-defined

289

therapeutic agents to either treat or prevent the spread of the infection. Short-term treatment

290

options are urgently required but many ongoing trials are not based upon a rational selection of

291

candidates in the context of safe achievable drug exposures. In the absence of a vaccine, there is

292

also an urgent need for chemo preventative strategies to protect those at high risk such as

293

healthcare staff, key workers and household contacts who are more vulnerable to infection.

294

Nitazoxanide has emerged as a potential candidate for repurposing for COVID-19. The PBPK model

295

presented herein was validated with an acceptable variation in AAFE and simulated/observed ratio

296

(close to 1), which provides confidence in the presented predictions. The present study aimed to

297

define the optimal doses and schedules for maintaining tizoxanide plasma and lung concentrations

298

above the reported nitazoxanide EC90 for the duration of the dosing interval.

299
300

Nitazoxanide was assessed in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial

301

(NCT01227421) of uncomplicated influenza in 74 primary care clinics in the USA between 27 Dec

302

2010 and 30 April 2011 [54]. The median duration of symptoms for patients receiving placebo was

303

117 h compared with 96 h in patients receiving 600 mg BID nitazoxanide with food. Importantly,

304

virus titre in nasopharyngeal swabs in 39 patients receiving nitazoxanide 600 mg BID were also lower

305

than in 41 patients receiving placebo. The average of reported tizoxanide EC90s for influenza A and B

306

[55] was calculated to be 8.4 mg/L, which is higher than the one reported EC90 for nitazoxanide

307

against SARS-CoV-2 [50]. The PBPK model was used to simulate plasma and lung exposures after

308

administration of 600 mg BID for 5 days, and while only plasma Cmax exceeded the average influenza

309

EC90 in the majority of patients, the Ctrough values did not. The modelling data suggest that the

310

moderate effects of nitazoxanide seen in influenza could be a function of under dosing. Taken

311

collectively, these data are encouraging for the application of nitazoxanide in COVID-19, assuming

312

that tizoxanide displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity comparable to that reported for nitazoxanide.

313

Moreover, these simulations indicate that higher doses may be optimal for maximal suppression of

314

pulmonary viruses.

315
316

In some cases, food intake may be difficult in patients with COVID-19 so drugs that can be given

317

without regard for food may be preferred. However, the presented predictions indicate that optimal

318

plasma and lung exposures would require 1200 mg QID, 1600 mg TID or 2900 mg BID in the fasted

319

state. Conversely, the PBPK models predict that doses of 700 mg QID, 900 mg TID or 1400 mg BID

320

with food provide tizoxanide concentrations in plasma and lung above the EC90 value for

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087130; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

321

nitazoxanide for the entire dosing interval in at least 90% of the simulated population. Single doses

322

up to 4000 mg have been administered to humans previously [29] but the drug is usually

323

administered at 500 mg BID.. The PBPK model simulations indicate a high BID dose of 1400 mg (fed)

324

and caution may be needed for gastrointestinal intolerance at this dose. The simulations indicate

325

that lower TID and QID dosing regimens may also warrant investigation, and 900 mg TID as well as

326

700 mg QID (both with food) regimen are also predicted to provide optimal exposures for efficacy.

327

Importantly, the overall daily dose was estimated to be comparable between the different optimal

328

schedules and it is unclear whether splitting the dose will provide gastrointestinal benefits. For

329

prevention application where individuals will need to adhere to regimens for longer durations,

330

minimising the frequency of dosing is likely to provide adherence benefits. However, for short term

331

application in therapy, more frequent dosing may be more acceptable to minimise gastrointestinal

332

intolerance.

333
334

Nitazoxanide mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. However, for influenza it

335

has been reported to involve interference with N-glycosylation of hemagglutinin [22, 55, 56]. Since

336

the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is also heavily glycosylated [57] with similar cellular targets in the

337

upper respiratory tract, a similar mechanism of action may be expected [7, 58]. An ongoing trial in

338

Mexico, is being conducted with 500 mg BID nitazoxanide with food [28] but these doses may not be

339

completely optimal for virus suppression across the entire dosing interval.

340
341

This analysis provides a rational dose optimisation for nitazoxanide for treatment and prevention of

342

COVID-19. However, there are some important limitations that must be considered. PBPK models

343

can be useful in dose prediction but the quality of predictions is only as good as the quality of the

344

available data on which they are based. Furthermore, the mechanism of action for nitazoxanide for

345

other viruses has also been postulated to involve an indirect mechanism through amplification of the

346

host innate immune response [59], and this would not have been captured in the in vitro antiviral

347

activity that informed the target concentrations for this dose prediction. The simulated population

348

used in this modelling consisted of healthy individuals up to 60 years old, but many patients

349

requiring therapy may be older and have underlying comorbidities. To best knowledge, the impact of

350

renal and hepatic impairment on pharmacokinetics of this drug have not been assessed and may

351

impact the pharmacokinetics. Although the current PBPK model is validated against various single

352

doses in the fasted state and few multiple doses when given with food, the model may predict with

353

less accuracy for multiple doses due to the unavailability of clinical data for multiple dosing over

354

1000 mg. The presented models were validated using BID doses only, and confidence in the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087130; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

355

predictions for TID and QID doses may be lower. The clinical studies used for model validation were

356

performed in a limited number of patients [29] and thus may underrepresent real inter-subject

357

variability. Also, the disposition parameters (apparent clearance and rate of absorption) obtained for

358

the PBPK model were from a fasted study of 500 mg BID, and the parameters were adjusted to

359

validate the tizoxanide model in the fed state, which may limit confidence in the model at higher

360

doses. Only one manuscript has described the in vitro activity of nitazoxanide against SARS-CoV-2

361

[50] and no data are available for tizoxanide. Reported in vitro data may vary across laboratories and

362

due to this the predicted optimal doses may change. However, the reported comparable activity of

363

nitazoxanide and tizoxanide against a variety of other viruses (including other coronaviruses) does

364

strengthen the rational for investigating this drug for COVID-19 [17-19, 21, 22]. Finally, none of the

365

reported EC90 values for influenza or SARS-CoV-2 were protein binding-adjusted [50] and tizoxanide

366

is known to be highly protein bound (>99%) in plasma [32]. Therefore, while the protein binding was

367

used to estimate drug penetration into the lung, data were not available to correct the in vitro

368

activity.

369
370

In summary, the developed PBPK model of nitazoxanide was successfully validated against clinical

371

data and based on currently available data, optimal doses for COVID-19 were estimated to be 700

372

mg QID, 900 mg TID or 1400 mg BID with food. Should nitazoxanide be progressed into clinical

373

evaluation for treatment and prevention of COVID-19, it will be important to further evaluate the

374

pharmacokinetics in these population groups. In treatment trials particularly, intensive

375

pharmacokinetic sampling may be challenging. Therefore, an optimal sparse sampling strategy for

376

BID, TID and QID dosing is also presented.

Study Highlights

530

What is the current knowledge on the topic?

531

COVID-19, an acute respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been declared as a pandemic by

532

the World Health Organisation. Several repurposed drugs are being evaluated but currently there are

533

no robustly validated treatment or preventative medicines or regimens. Nitazoxanide has shown in

534

vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2, influenza and several other animal and human RNA viruses.

535

What question did this study address?

536

The manuscript describes the pharmacokinetics of tizoxanide, the active metabolite of nitazoxanide

537

using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model. The validated PBPK model was used to

538

estimate the optimal doses required for SARS-CoV-2 treatment or prevention such that >90% of the

539

simulated population would have tizoxanide concentrations in the plasma and lung above the

540

reported 90% effective concentration (EC90) value of nitazoxanide for the entire dosing interval.

541

What does this study add to our knowledge?

542

There are no reported studies that identify treatment regimens of nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2

543

treatment or prevention. The current study provides evidence-based alternative dosing regimens of

544

nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2 treatment and prevention that exceeds antiviral EC90s in key tissues and

545

organs for the duration of the dosing interval.

546

How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science?

547

Efficacy of nitazoxanide has been demonstrated for uncomplicated influenza and the presented

548

predictions may help inform nitazoxanide dose selection for COVID19 clinical trials.
