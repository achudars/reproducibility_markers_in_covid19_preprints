Abstract
Background

Institute of Graduate Studies & Research (IGSR), Alexandria University, Egypt
High Institute of Public Health, Alexandria University, Egypt

: COVID-19 pandemic is an extraordinary threat with significant implications in all aspects of

human life, therefore, it represents the most immediate challenges for all countries all over the world.

Objectives

: This study is intended to develop a GIS-based analysis model to explore, quantify and model

the relationships between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and their potential predictor variables.

Method:

For this purpose, a model was developed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates in

Africa up to 16

of August 2020 at the national level. The model involved Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis through ArcGIS was applied.

rates within different African countries. At continental level, OLS revealed that COVID-19 incidence rate

was found to be positively associated with overcrowding, health expenditure, HIV infections and air

pollution and negatively associated with BCG vaccine (β=2.97,1.45, 0.01, 3.29, -47.65 respectively,

Introduction
COVID-19 is the key global challenge nowadays with a lockdown of more

than6 billion people (Iqbal et al., 2020) . The novel coronavirus (SRAS-COV-2) was

In fact, this virus spread rapidly resulting in an epidemic throughout

deaths. In Africa, more than 2 million of COVID-19 cases and about 49 thousands

confirmed deaths were reported up to date (WHO, 2020b).

The transmission of COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through direct person-

transmission.

Furthermore,

closeness and duration of contact increases the risk of infection (He et al., 2020).

19 cases and deaths are negatively correlated with temperature (Iqbal et al., 2020)

and positively correlated with

absolute

humidity (Pani et al., 2020).

Also, it was

argued that that air pollution can promote to sustained transmission of COVID-19,

where COVID-19 incidence was found to be positively correlated with PM2.5 and

NO 2 (Li et al., 2020). This may highlight the role of quality of life (QOL) as one of the
main determinants of COVID-19 incidence. In addition to air pollution, QOL can be

manifested in access to drinking water and sanitation services.

Also, the association between Particulate Matter (PM) pollution and COVID-

19 case fatality rate was emphasized (Yao et al., 2020). Moreover, it was argued that

including infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19. in this respect, it was found

that half of world countries have not sufficient operational readiness capacities for

dealing with potential health emergencies associated with COVID-19 (Pung et al.,

2020).

Furthermore, vulnerability of individuals to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality

can be increased by comorbidity of some chronic diseases. For example, it was found

that elderly individuals (65 years old and above), who have comorbidities, such as

hypertension or diabetes

mellitus (DM), are expected to develop

a more severe

that the COVID-19 fatality rates were found to be associated with poverty and urban

population proportions (Finch and Hernández Finch, 2020). Both COVID-19 cases and

fatalities were found to strongly associated with lower education levels (Hawkins et

al., 2020) and tobacco smoking (Baron, 2020).

Such an overall objective can be attained through the following three specific

objectives including:

analyzing spatial variations of COVID19 cases and delineating

the main hotspots, exploring various determinants of COVID-19 spatial pattern. and

identifying the most significant determinants of COVID-19.

Such a GIS-based model

can provide better understanding of the key factors underlying COVID-19 incidence

Such

the case of deaths compared to confirmed cases.

Figure 2: Spatial auto correlation analysis

Generally, it can be argued that, based on statistically significant P-value and
high positive z-score, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 incidence and deaths rates
tend to be clustered and the null hypothesis of Complete Spatial Randomness can be
rejected. Hot Spot analysis revealed that a cold spot of COVID-19 incidence and
fatality rates was noticeably identified in East of Africa (Figure 3-a & b). Meanwhile,
three hot spots of COVID-19 incidence rate were identified. These hot spots included
Egypt and Libya in the north east, Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia in the
north west in addition to Namibia in the south (Figure 3-a). Also, two hot spots of
COVID-19 fatality rates were identified in the north-eastern and north-western parts
of the continent (Figure 3-b) corresponding to but more significant compared to hot
spots of incidence rate.

Generally, the results of OLS model are promising as the

of 0.4535 in case of COVID-19 incidence and 0.5338 in case of

fatality. This means that the model explained about 45% and 53% of the variance in

COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates, respectively. However, such a relatively low

level of explanatory power of the model can be justified by data accuracy and the

nature of OLS itself that doesn’t consider the local variations in COVID-19 incidence

and fatality and predictor variables. Accordingly, to increase the explanatory power

of the model, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was applied considering

spatial relationships between COVID-19 incidence as well as fatality rates and various

predictors variables.

except for BCG vaccine, mostly the GWR model parameters were found to be less

varied recording low standard deviation.
