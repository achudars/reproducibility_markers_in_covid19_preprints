Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, an infection capable of causing severe disease
and death but which may also be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic in many individuals.
While several risk factors, including age, have been described, the mechanisms of this
variation are poorly understood. Several studies have described associations between
blood group and COVID-19 severity, while others do not. Expression of ABO glycans on
secreted proteins and non-erythroid cells is controlled by a fucosyltransferase (FUT2).
Inactivating mutations result in a non-secretor phenotype which is known to protect

Results

COVID-19 patients with Blood Group A are more likely to be hospitalized and suffer
cardiovascular complications.
A total of 471 adult patients had been admitted to North Bristol NHS Trust (UK) with a
positive PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 and ABO blood group data was available for 44%
(n=209) of these. Retrospective analysis of these data revealed that among all the blood
types, blood type A was the most common in COVID-19 patients, followed by O, B and

convalescent plasma samples include a broader range of donors who had self-reported
recovery from hospitalisation, donors who had positive PCR tests and donors who had
suffered known symptoms and undergone a positive antibody test. In confirmation of our
previous results, we observed a lower than expected number of non-secretors in blood
group A donors who had reported hospitalisation (N= 55), but note that this analysis is

The association of blood group A with cardiac disease is well documented and is linked to

32

VWF (reviewed by

). Our data are the first to specifically link the severity of disease in

COVID-19 patients to homozygous group A individuals who are also secretors. Levels of
VWF in plasma are highest in homozygous group A individuals

We propose this is likely linked to the degree of N-glycosylation of VWF

34

particularly at position 1574 near the site of cleavage by ADAMTS13.

It follows that

more extensive glycosylation of VWF found in group A secretors but lacking in group O
secretors could account for higher circulating levels of VWF in Group A and thereby
predispose Group A patients to cardiac problems and thrombosis during infections with
SARS-CoV-2.
