Hidden Parameters Impacting Resurgence of SARS-CoV-2
Pandemic *
Yi Zhang and Sanjiv Kapoor†
Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, USA.

The spread of the COVID-19 virus has had an enormous impact on the world’s health
and socioeconomic system. While lockdowns, which severely limit the movement of the
population, have been implemented in March 2020 and again recently, the psychological and economic cost are severe. Removal of these restrictions occurred with varying
degrees of success.
To study the resurgence of the virus in some communities we consider an epidemiological model, SIR-SD-L, that incorporates introduction of new population due to the
removal of lockdown and identify parameters that impact the spread of the virus. This
compartmental model of the epidemic incorporates a social distance metric based on
progression of the infections; it models the dynamic propensity of infection spread based
on the current infections relative to the susceptible population. The model is validated
using data on growth of infections, hospitalizations and death, considering 24 counties
in multiple US states and a categorization of the lockdown removal policies after the
first lockdown. Model parameters, which include a compartment for the isolated population, are used to determine the rate at which the susceptible population increases
to fit the rate of infections. Along with social distancing mandates, we identify active
infections and the susceptible population as important factors in the resurgence of infections. We measure the efficacy of the lockdown removal policy via a ratio, PIR, which
evaluates to less than 1 for counties where social distancing measures were mandated
and which delayed complete re-opening of closed spaces like bars and restaurants. For
other counties this ratio is greater than 1.
We also studied infection growth in the 24 US counties with respect to a release policy
derived from CDC guidelines and compared against strategies that delay the removal
of lockdown.
Our results illustrate that guidelines for deciding when lockdown rules are to be relaxed
should consider the current state of the infectious population and the remaining susceptible population, hidden parameters that are deducible from models such as SIR-SD-L,
and not limit policy considerations to the rate of new infections alone. This is especially

Introduction

The current health crisis induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in lockdown procedures in countries around the world and is also marked by considerable debate over the use of social distancing, including the use of masks. While guidelines have been issued, adherence has been patchy.
In this context, timing the removal of lockdown and social distancing guidelines play an important
role in controlling the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (1). Since the incubation period of
the disease results in delayed impact on the progression of the disease, long term accurate modeling of the
spread of the virus is critical. While it is anticipated that lockdown removal will result in resurgence of the
virus, the impact of the policies are not clear on the resurgence. In some countries that adopted stringent
controls when the lockdown was removed, e.g. NewZealand and Thailand (2), there was considerable
success in controlling the virus. In other countries there was considerably less success (3).
An analysis of the spread of infection after the lockdown ends is critical so as to determine policies that
could be used to prevent capacity issues in the healthcare system (4). The resurgence in some states of US
in the months following the removal of the first lockdown has been especially concerning. We construct
a model to account for this resurgence utilizing a release mechanism incorporated into a compartmental
model and identify key factors that influence the resurgence of the virus. We consider 24 counties in US
and illustrate the importance of determining the number of active infections as well as the susceptible
population left when planning for removal of lockdown. Government mandated policies also played a
substantial role.
The analysis is based on epidemic spread models, adapted from the SIR model (5, 6) (originally from
Kermack and McKendrick (7–9)). A key differentiation in this work is the use of dynamic social distancing factor in the model, termed the SIR-SD model. Prior evidence that the reduction in social contacts
has consequent impact on the reproduction number R0 has been investigated in (10). The methodology
requires the use of matrices that model the contact between population groups and estimates of the matrix
may be difficult to obtain. The contact patterns assumed are, however, not dynamic. Dynamic changes in
the transmission factor of the infection as a function of government social distancing measures, has also
been modeled in (11). Additionally, prior research on the impact of social distancing has been considered
by Kissler et al. (12) which considers the impact of intermittent social distancing on critical care capacity.
Recent modeling efforts have focused on specific covariates like mobility (13) and modeling and analysis
of various other aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is widespread (14–22).
In this research, we consider an alternate viewpoint where, in this model, we use a social distancing
factor to modify the virus transmission rate that reflects the behavior of the population as the number
of infection cases rises and reporting of the infections, as well as government mandates, becomes more
prevalent. The transmission of the virus incorporates a factor that is inversely dependent on the number
of cumulative infections and that incorporates a time-dependent susceptible population size.
We focus our attention on select counties in US that showed large number of infections. Our analysis
of the time period between March and September, 2020, illustrates that removal of lockdown leads to
increased rates of infection, especially in counties that had fewer mandates on social distancing measures
and allowed closed spaces, including bars and restaurants, to reopen. The analysis utilizes a ratio, P IR,

which measures the peak daily new infections after removal of lockdown relative to the peak daily new
infections during the lockdown period. This ratio is related to the ratio of active infections at reopen
relative to the peak active infections during lockdown. Additionally the ratio, P IR, increases with the
percentage of susceptible population left. Statistics of these ratios are not accurately known but these
hidden parameters can be estimated from the model we propose. In our analysis, the ratio P IR was less
than one for counties with strong social distancing mandates and was much greater than one for other
counties.
The model we develop is also used to compare the criteria for reopening. We compare the cumulative
new cases that resulted from the actual reopening time against a two-phase downward trajectory policy
that emerges from CDC guidelines (23) as well as against a policy that further delayed reopening by 1
month (30 days). The two-phased trajectory only accounts for the current rate of infection and does not
account for factors that have shown to be important in our analysis, the susceptible population left and the
current count of the infected population. The results illustrate the benefits of delayed reopening in terms
of case counts, as this reduces the active infections in the community.
In summary, we advocate the use of epidemiology models that can accurately estimate the number of
active infections and the susceptible population to guide the re-open policy. The rate at which population
is released from lockdown also impacts the resurgence and its impact should be computed from the model.
Furthermore, there is a stark contrast between counties that used social distancing measures like strict
usage of masks and restricted use of crowded spaces and those that did not have restrictions.
Publicly available data from multiple repositories (24–26) was used.

2 Viral Resurgence
Guidelines and timing of easing of lockdown conditions are very critical, requiring an analysis of the
pandemic growth rate, especially when lockdown has been applied early and the impact of the virus
is less evident. Policy based on limited local spread of the virus can be misleading. To identify the
impact of the number of active infections, the number of susceptible people left and the population size
on the resurgence of the virus, the analysis presented below, utilizes a model that incorporates infections,
hospitalizations as well as the population under lockdown.

2.1 SIR-SD-L Model:
Our model incorporates population compartments that include the susceptible population S, the possible
hosts to the virus, the currently infected population I, the set of population that are hospitalized IH and
those that are tested and non-hospitalized set IN . R is the recovered population and D the dead. The
impact of the lockdown is via the population that is in the set marked H. H is the population that went
into effective lockdown with the the assumption that no interaction of this population exists with the
infected population. On removal of lockdown, a fraction of the population transitions from H to the set
S. As compared to the standard SEIR model we eliminate the transition to the exposed set as data for this
transition has to be inferred or adopted from literature and is not useful in our model. We also do not have
an explicit asymptomatic population; we assume that the impact of this is implicit in the infection rate.
Instead we allow the population to transit directly from S to I with the assumption that the susceptible
fraction is ηN , to account for the fraction that may form a host to the virus at a point of time. Furthermore

the testing and reporting of infections include some of the asymptomatic cases and all of this population
is in the I with transitions leading to hospitalizations or otherwise. In addition to the compartments in

where β is the infection rate and γ is the rate of transition from infected set I to IH . γ2 is the transition
rate from I to IN . The rates α1 , α2 and α3 are transitions between compartments as illustrated in Figure 1.
H is a time-varying function that represents the population that is under “lockdown”.
For the purpose of our analysis we consider that dH/dt is a constant, corresponding to a linear release
function; hence the term L in the model name SIR-SD-L.
Social Distancing impact: To model the impact of social distancing, we consider a modification of the
SIR model with social distancing where β, the infection rate, is dynamic. In this model, β is dependent
on the infection spread as measured by the number of cumulative infections. While retaining the other
properties of the SIR model, we let the function β be defined as:
β = β0

1 − c1
1 − c1 · SS0

where S0 = ηN is the initial susceptible population and β0 a constant. When additional population is
released from H, the parameter β becomes:
β = β0

where H0 is the initial population under lockdown and H the current population under lockdown. This
model measures the psychological “fear” impact of of the spread of the virus. Other models have studied
impact of covariates that include mobility, interventions, density etc. on the variable β via neural networks
(13). Incorporating the social distancing model provides for a better fit to the infection dynamics. We
illustrate this on the standard SIR model during the period of lockdown corresponding to each county.
The actual dates differed across counties. We choose 24 counties in the US to fit the model, with the
model parameters being estimated by fitting to available data on cumulative infections, hospitalizations
and deaths. The loss function is discussed in the appendix and here we compare the two models using
weighted Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the error in estimating the cumulative infection
data where the weighting geometrically decreases, starting at the end of the time series. The fitting is
illustrated for a few counties in Figure 2.
The weighted Root Mean Squared Error of the cumulative cases is provided in Table 1 to show the
comparison between the two models. For some of counties in New Jersey and New York we see substantial improvement of RMSE values. On average the SIR-SD model reduces the RMSE by 28% as
compared to the standard model SIR model.

2.2 Impact of Removal of lockdown population
After the relative success of the initial lockdown a phased approach was specified which would have
moved states to various stages of normalcy. Unfortunately this resulted in resurgence of the virus in
multiple counties and states. Each of the individual states had defined their own policies based on CDC
guidelines and that resulted in removal of lockdown with somewhat different policies and mandates.
While many states did not mandate masks and additionally had few restrictions mandated for places
where large gatherings might take place, other states had restrictions which were eased very cautiously.
Data was obtained about the announced reopen dates of each county from news and government website (24, 27). Also recorded were the policies on face covering which were categorised into 3 color-coded
categories. Counties which explicitly emphasized the mandated restrictions including requiring face covering all the time in public places and had strict guidelines on bars and restaurants were colored red.
Counties with milder emphasis and recommendations on face coverings, either by the state or by counties
themselves were allocated yellow. A green color meant that there was no explicit mandate announced
separate from CDC guidelines. The details can be found in Table 2. State government guidelines were
used when no specific county guideline was available.
To model the release from lockdown via the proposed linear release function, we added population
back from the population set H to the susceptible on a daily basis, until an estimated number of people,
H0 have emerged from lockdown. The release started 7 days after the date a county enters phase 2 of
reopening; this models an initial phase of cautious reopening. H0 is obtained by the algorithm that fits
the model. Due to change in the demography of the population newly added to the susceptible pool, the
reopen phase introduces 2 new parameters, k, k2 . The rate of release is represented by the parameter
h, the fraction of total population under lockdown that is released everyday into the susceptible set, i.e.
h = 0.05 implies that the estimated population H0 that emerges from lockdown is released linearly in 20
days. k and k2 are multipliers for γ and α2 , respectively, in the reopen phase. We observed a decrease
in hospitalization and mortality rates as different counties entered the reopen phase and use these 2 new

parameter to account for that change. The parameter estimation outcome for 24 different counties is in
Figure 3, which illustrates the graph of the cumulative infections obtained from fitting our model, as well
as the predicted count of deaths. The shaded region in each figure illustrates the range of predictions
with 95% confidence interval (details of the computation are in the appendix). The actual data is mostly
contained within the confidence interval bands provided by the model predictions.
To measure the parameters that impact the reopening or removal of lockdown, we investigated the
peak infection ratio, P IR, for each county during the time frame mid-March to end of August. P IR
is the ratio of the peak daily new cases after reopen relative to the peak daily new case before reopen
during this time frame. We correlate this with P AR, the peak active ratio as determined by Ireopen /Ipeak
which is the ratio of the active cases when a county enters reopen phase relative to the peak active cases
before reopen. We then correlate P IR with SLR = Sreopen /S0 , the ratio of susceptibles at reopen with
respect to the initial susceptible population. We also correlate P IR with HSR = H0 /S0 the ratio of
the population that emerges from lockdown over the initial exposed susceptible population. An increased
value of H0 could represent the set of people that are taking additional risks after the removal of lockdown.
An interesting relationship emerges between log(P IR) and SLR and HSR ( Figure 4), As the figures
suggest, slower release of the population guided by mandates and emphasis on social distancing policies
that include masks as well as limitations on public gatherings, influence the ratio, P IR, and help limit the
next peak. This is shown by the increasing relation between the log of the peak ratio, log(P IR) and the
other ratios, HSR, SLR and P AR. Interestingly for counties that are colored red, log(P IR) is negative
while log(P IR) is positive for counties colored green. This illustrates the impact of state and county
policies on the resurgence of the virus. Counties that had lower P IR had either less active cases or less
susceptible population at the time of reopening, further indicating the importance of timing the reopening.

The impact of delayed release

Timing the reopening, an important aspect of the resurgence, was primarily based on government guidelines. The CDC (23) recommendations led to a federal plan for re-opening after lockdown. The plan was
published in a document outlining conditions for phased re-opening in mid April (28), which specifies
the threshold for entering successive reopen phases. From these guidelines we extracted the primary rule
where entry into each of two phases, phase 2 and phase 3 required a downward trajectory of new cases for
14 days, with some allowances. We implemented these rules to establish a time for reopening into phase 3
for each of the counties. We term this the Two-phase Rule and compare this rule against the schedule for
actual removal of lockdown that occurred, as well as against rules that delayed the release of lockdown
further by a week to a month.
To illustrate the impact of the opening strategies we consider 6 counties. where the two phases were
almost consecutive in that there was a consistent decrease of new active cases ( Figure 5 ). For multiple
other counties, the appendix illustrates the time of opening into phase 3 based on the Two-Phase rule.
For each of the counties, the blue curve, in the left part of the corresponding figure, is a cubic spline
smoothing (with coefficient 0.1) on the 14-day moving average of new cases. The 2 green time windows
are the detected 14-day downward trajectories, in which we allow 3 days of increase as a grace period,
following the CDC guidelines. After the detection of the 2 downward trajectories (decreasing new case
counts) a county was progressed into phase 3 reopening in accordance with the Two-phase rule. The
vertical dotted line is the actual date the county entered phase 3 as indicated from government sources. In
the figures to the right we illustrate simulated cumulative cases when lockdown was released according to
multiple policies. The shaded area is the cumulative infection following the actual removal of lockdown
while GCDC illustrates the growth when a county starts phase 3 following the Two-phase guideline. We
also simulate the scenarios when the actual reopening is delayed by 1 week and 1 month (30 days). All
the simulations utilized the model developed earlier in the paper.
As illustrated in Figure 6, delaying the opening would have helped in reducing the total number of the
cases. While delaying by 1 week reduced the number of infections, Table 3 illustrates that delaying by 1
month could have resulted in substantial less infections in some counties. The delay ratio is the ratio of
the new infections after reopen when the reopen is delayed by 1 month, versus the actual new infection
cases after the actual reopening date. An average reduction of new cases by 42% is illustrated within the
time frame we considered. Over an extended period of time the improvement would likely be less.

5.2 Methods
We use a discrete-step version to compute the model parameters. In all the models we start the fitting on
the day when there are more than 5 reported cases and stop at the end of August to reduce errors due to
long term impact of reopening. We tried two standard constrained optimization methods “L-BFGS-B”
and “TNC” but did not observe much difference between the two.
Model parameters were obtained using a program to fit the differential equations. The variables used
in the model are η, β, γ, γ2 , α1 , α2 , α3 , c1 , where η specifies the susceptible set, i.e. S0 = ηN . An
optimizer was used to fit determine the parameters using a loss function
0
L(η, β, γ, γ2 , α1 , α2 , α3 , c1 ) = θ1 f (G(t), G0 (t)) + θ2 f (D(t), D0 (t)) + (1 − θ1 − θ2 )f (IH (t), IH
(t))

where G0 (t) is the computed cumulative infections, G(t) is the actual data time series of cumulative
0 (t)) represent the cumulative deaths (active hospitalinfected cases; similarly D(t) (IH (t)) and D0 (t)(IH
ization) in the model and from the actual data, respectively. The function f was chosen to minimize the
RMSE, alternatively maximize the R2 value (coefficient of determination) of the data with a geometric

weighting emphasizing the latest data. In all the models we use a geometrically decreasing weighting
with a common ratio 0.98 favoring the latest terms in the data sequences. For the case where we fit both
the initial and the reopen phases, each phase is applied with this weighting independently, making sure
that the end of the initial phase is fitted relatively close to the reported data. The data was obtained from
multiple sources (24, 29)
We first illustrate the advantage of using the SIR-SD model over the traditional SIR model.
5.2.1 SIR-SD model comparison and advantages:
Discussion of Program 1. We first compared the SIR-SD model against the traditional SIR model
where the transmission parameter β is a constant. To eliminate the influence of the release in the reopen
phase we limit the fitting within only the initial phase before the reopen phase. We set θ1 = 0.9, θ2 = 0.05
in the loss function L(), so as to focus on fitting G instead of D and IH , in order to compare to the fitting
of the traditional SIR model that only fits G. The results for our curve fitting are illustrated in Figure 3.
The range specified to the optimizer for the parameter γ for SIR model was [0.04, 0.08] as the mean
infectious period is reported to be within this range (30). In the SIR-SD model we used
β = β0

1 − c1
1 − c1 · S0 +HS0 −H

Note that before entering the reopen phase,
β = β0

1 − c1
1 − c1 · SS0

The SIR-SD model had a better fit than the SIR model, as illustrated in Figure 7 and as measured by
RMSE values in Table 1.
5.2.2 SIR-SD with linear release Model fitting
Discussion of Program 2 To fit the model parameters during the lockdown phase and subsequently the
re-opening phase we partition our fitting into two phases, the initial and the reopen phase. As mentioned
before, each phase is weighted geometrically favoring the latest data. After some experimentation, we
choose θ1 = 0.45, θ2 = 0.45 to weight different series, G, D and IH . In the reopen phase, in addition to
the regular interactions between different compartments, we estimated a size of population, previously in
hiding, that is to be released into the susceptible set, as well as the daily speed of that release, assuming a
linear release function. It is worth mentioning that during our study we observed a drop in hospitalization
and deaths in the reopening phase. In order to capture this we assigned multiplier parameters, k and k2
valued from 0 to 1 to the parameters γ, α2 in the reopening phase to modify the behavior of hospitalization and fatality. Table 4 shows the weighted RMSE and weighted R2 values of cumulative cases G
and cumulative deaths D that measures our fitting method. After obtaining the best-fit parameters, we
determined the relative standard deviation of the reported cases and deaths G, D, against our simulated
data G0 , D0 . Monte Carlo simulations (1000 runs) were used applying random scatter via a Gaussian
distribution using the standard deviation computed to obtain 95% confidence intervals of each day of the
fitting. Using Monte Carlo simulations we also obtained the distributions of all the parameters. The key

entire time range using SIR-SD-L model

5.2.3 Extended Simulation
We finally ran experiments to delay the release by 1 month to determine the decrease in cumulative cases
by the end of September. We used the parameters determined by the model-fitting process. As shown in
Figure 6, a one month delay contributes to a significant decrease in cumulative cases. The shaded area
represents the cumulative cases for the actual release and the blue curve represents the cumulative cases
if the release is delay by 1 month. In Table 3 we list out the ratio of the net increase in cumulative cases if
we delay the reopen by 1 month, relative to net increase of the actually reported new cases, over the same
time period. This period is over the range of dates starting from each county’s reopen date up to the end
of August 2020. We see an average drop of 42% across the 24 counties.
