Abstract
Background: The viral dynamics and the role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2
are not completely understood. Our aim was to evaluate how RT-PCR Ct values among
children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared with that of adult subjects.
Methods: Patients (aged from 2 months to ≤18 years, and adults) with signs and
symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for less than 7 days, were prospectively
enrolled in the study from May to November 2020. All participants performed RT-PCR
assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection; Ct values of ORF1ab, N, and S gene-targets, and the
average of all the three probes were used as surrogates of viral load.
Results: Of the total of 376 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection there were
21 infants, 62 children and 293 adults. The RT-PCR Ct values of children under 18 were
not significantly different from that of adults, as observed by the analyzed probes (namely
ORF1ab, N, and S), and by the mean of all 3 gene-targets. However, infants had
significantly lower Ct values compared to children and adults (P = 0.044).
Discussion: Ct values for children were not significantly different than that of adults with
positive SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, infants had even lower Ct values when compared to
older children and adults. Although viral load is not the only determinant of transmission,
infants may play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community,
especially if or when this population returns to regular daycare activities.

Key words: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, children, cycle threshold, viral load.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of a new viral pneumonia was identified in Wuhan,
China1. Phylogenetic analysis of the new virus, classified initially as 2019 nCoV, pointed
it as a member of the Betacoronavirus genus. This virus presented typical features of
the coronavirus family previously identified in humans, bats and other wild animals. By
February 2020, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on
Virus Taxonomy suggested a nomenclature change to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to phylogenetic analysis relating this new
virus to coronaviruses2.
Since then, all countries have been dealing with this pandemic with an unprecedented
number of severe and also non-severe patients. Still, children have somehow been
spared from these severe outcomes. An important issue that still needs clarification
relates to understanding the impact of viral load for different levels of disease, since
these could be associated not only with disease severity, but also to its impact on
infectivity and viral transmission in the community. The difference on the amount of viral
loads between infected children and adults is at this stage of knowledge yet a matter of
some debate3,4.
The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 can be indirectly measured using the cycle threshold (Ct)
value of automated RT-PCR techniques, and its value is inversely proportional to the
viral load. Ct value is defined as the number of cycles necessary to amplify viral RNA to
reach a detectable level, which is a positive fluorescent amplification signal in a real-time
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay5,6. Pujadas et. al.7
suggested the use of viral load to identify severe patients, and to develop predictive
algorithms.
The role of children as spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 is not completely understood, even
though it is clear that they (as a group) have been spared of severe presentations of the

disease3,8. However, such differences among different age groups remain unclear9. In
this study we report the viral RNA Ct values patterns observed during the early phase of
infection in a cohort of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and have these Ct
values compared between infants (2 mo. to <2 years), children between 2 years to <18
years and adults (≥18 years).

Materials and Methods
This was a prospective cross-sectional multicenter study with data collected in two
hospitals in Brazil. From May to November 2020, we assessed outpatient subjects seen
at these emergency rooms (ERs), or those hospitalized, presenting with at least one sign
or symptom suggestive of COVID-19 (cough, fever, or sore throat) within 7 days of
symptoms onset (SO). Eligible patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were
included in the study. Main exclusion criteria was failure to collect an appropriate sample
for diagnosis. Age groups compared were classified as infants (2 mo. to <2 years),
children (aged from ≥2 to <18 years) and adults (≥18 years).
All participants performed RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Procedure for
sample collection involved one bilateral nasopharyngeal and one oropharyngeal swab
collection. Both swabs were placed in the same transport medium with saline solution
and RNAlater®, RNA Stabilization Solution (Catalog number AM7021). RNA was
extracted using MagMax™ Viral/Pathogenic Nucleic Acid Isolation (Applied Biosystems)
in the KingFisher Duo Prime System platform (ThermoFisher, USA). The RT-PCR assay
was and performed using PathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (catalog number
A15299, AppliedBiosystems) and TaqManTM 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (catalog number
A47532, which comprised ORF1ab, S and N SARS-CoV-2–specific targets) in 10 µL
total reaction, of which 5 µL were RNA. For reaction control we used 5 µL (200 copies/µL)
of TaqManTM 2019-nCoV Control Kit v1 (catalog number A47533). Due to assistencial

and laboratory decisions, since 7th October, the RT-PCR assays were performed using
only for N and ORF1ab SARS-CoV-2–specific targets.
We excluded participants with clinical conditions that compromised the immune system
and could potentially interfere with viral load, such as type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus,
previous organ transplant, cancer diagnosis or subjects who had chemotherapy in the
two weeks previous to enrollment.
We included in these analyses only participants within the first 7 days of SO, since the
peak of infectivity largely occurs in the first week of illness10(p19). All the three probes cycle
threshold (Ct) values of ORF1ab, N, S gene-targets and the median of these were
compared as surrogates of viral load. Percentages were used to describe categorical
variables; continuous variables were summarized in terms of median and interquartile
range (IQR). Data normality assumptions were verified for continuous variables. Twotailed Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test or two-tailed Kruskal-Wallis test followed by
Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons, used to compare Ct values of
ORF1ab, S and N SARS-CoV-2–specific targets between groups. Linear regression
analysis was performed to predict the Ct values from RT-PCR assays, and odds ratio
with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. All data preprocessing and analyses
were performed in R 3.5.0 statistical software11.
The study was performed in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice Guidelines, after approval by the Hospital Moinhos de Vento Institutional
Review Board (IRB number 30749720.4.1001.5330) submitted April 14th, 2020 and a
decision made April 17th, 2020 (decision number 3.977.144). All participants included in
this study provided either a written informed consent, or a legal responsible provided
written informed consent.

Results
In the study 1,823 subjects were originally screened and 334 were excluded for different
reasons, Figure 1. All subjects who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (N=1,113) were
removed from the current analysis, as shown in Figure 1. In the end there were 376
participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 21 (5.6%) infants, 62 (16.5%)
children and 293 (77.9%) adults.

In the initial analysis participants were split in two groups, of <18 years and ≥18 years of
age, to compare overall children and adult mean Ct values. Mean Ct values for children
(<18 years) and adults were 20.73 and 20.83 (P = 0.453), respectively, for all gene
targets (Figure 2). When children were further stratified in two age groups, mean Ct
values were 18.11 for infants, 21.19 for children, and 20.84 for adults (P= 0.128) for all
gene targets, as shown in Figure 3. To increase study power, older children and adults
were then combined as a group, and compared to infants. Median Ct values for ORF1ab,
S, and for the median of all the three gene-targets were significantly lower in infants
group P = 0.037, P = 0.006, P = 0.044, respectively) (Figure 4).
There were 10.6% of the adults (31/293) who required hospitalization, while almost all
infants and children had only mild clinical symptoms with only one child needing
admission, yet not progressing for a severe outcome.

Discussion
Our findings reinforce some previous findings suggesting that children do not have lower
SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, as compared to adults12. Going a step further than this latter
study, infants with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing had even lower Ct values when
compared to other age groups. It is important to remember that there was no clinical
correlation with these low Ct results in infants, since they all presented very mild disease.
As suggested by Yonker et al4 children could carry higher viral loads even with mild
symptoms. Yet another study confirms the finding from the study in California, suggesting
that children younger than five years of age presented higher viral load when compared
with older children and adults3,12. However, recent viral load comparisons across age
groups have yielded inconsistent conclusions3,12,13. Some studies following adults only
show a positive correlation between higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load with disease severity,
need of mechanical ventilation, and/or higher mortality rates, which is not the case in
children. The reasons for such differences in the relation of viral load and severity across
age groups are not yet fully understood14.
Although viral load may not be the only determinant of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, it
is probably one of the most important factors. On the other hand, as children usually
present with a milder form of disease, the lower frequency of cough and the generation
of droplets and aerosols may have some impact in reducing the risk of aerosolized
transmission. However, despite the usual milder disease in children, our findings
highlight that efforts to mitigate transmission should include this age group. The finding
of a higher viral load in, since the use of masks have not been recommended for this age
group15,16.
Our study has some limitations worth mentioning. We have included only symptomatic
participants during the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, so that we cannot draw
conclusions about asymptomatic individuals or those later in the course of the disease.

Another limitation was a restricted sample size of infected children. Social distancing,
closed schools and daycare centers, together with the concern to take children to ERs
have led to a sharp reduction in the overall number of pediatric consultations. Therefore,
the real scenario of COVID-19 in the pediatric population is not yet known13,17,18. There
was also a great variability observed in the days of SO to inclusion, which could introduce
some bias introduced by different timing for PCR collection, as not all subjects were at
the same stage of disease. Furthermore, the quality and volume of viral RNA on collected
swabs could vary depending on how sample collection was conducted19. We have not
corrected our sample for the amount of viral RNA, since it would only add another step
to the diagnostic routine that was already overstretched at that point of the pandemic.
But it is well known that Cycle threshold values can be affected by a batch effect20, since
variations among different runs can occur.
Despite these limitations our findings are strong enough to suggest that symptomatic
children may play a significant role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission since they harbor viral
loads that are not lower than adults. Our finding suggesting that infants had even lower
Ct values (thus higher viral load) than all other age strata raises some concern, because
it indicates that when daycare activities return to "normal" while transmission of SARSCoV-2 is still running in the community, this specific population may be a significant
source of contamination to adults and older children.

Conclusion
Our findings strongly suggest that symptomatic children have equivalent Ct values when
compared to adults. Furthermore, our study is the first to describe that infants present
even lower SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct levels, indicating that this age group may play a
significant role as spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
