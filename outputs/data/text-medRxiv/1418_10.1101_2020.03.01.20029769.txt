ABSTRACT
Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City,
China has spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms,
but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific
medication. The purpose of this study is to explore changes of markers in peripheral

blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring.
Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19
diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship
between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was
analyzed.
Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission,
the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The
most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath
(57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common
comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary
involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography
(CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with
patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious
lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein
(CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed
transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the
inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline
interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely
related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings.
Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP,
LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may
positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type
patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in
IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas
the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease
progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring
in severe COVID-19 patients.
Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was
closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly
related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was

closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease
exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker
for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
In early December, 2019, the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were
reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province Province, China. The pathogen has been
identified as a novel β-coronavirus by full-genome sequencing and is named severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which shares phylogenetic
similarity with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that
caused the outbreak of SARS in 2003.1-3 Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which has
been highly contagious and spread rapidly nationwide and worldwide, has been
designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization
(WHO). Analysis of the epidemiological pattern curve of COVID-19 showed that the
overall epidemic pattern was aggregation outbreak. Most cases are mild to moderate
and curable, and the overall crude mortality rate is low.2 However, a proportion of
patients with severe disease characterized by respiratory dysfunction have shown a
high mortality rate.2 4 By February 16, 2020, a total number of 57934 cases have been
reported in mainland China, including 10644 severe cases. As the outbreak area of
COVID-19, the total number of confirmed cases in Hubei is 49847, with 9797 (19.6%)
severe cases and an overall mortality rate of 3.4%. The disease incidence and
mortality rate of severe COVID-19 in Hubei is relatively high as compared with other
areas in China.
At present, due to the lack of reliable marker and effective antiviral medication, the
monitoring of severe cases of COVID-19 mainly relies on the observation of clinical
presentation.4

Previous studies have suggested that lymphocytopenia and

inflammatory cytokine storm are typical abnormalities in infections caused by highly
pathogenic coronavirus, such as SARS and MERS, and are considered disease
severity related.6-9 Similarly,

a decrease in lymphocyte count and an increase in

inflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood have been reported in COVID-19

patients.10-12 Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 and the high mortality rate of
severe cases, a better understanding of the clinical features is urgently needed and
may help screen out reliable markers for inflammation monitoring through the course
of disease. According to previous relevant literature on viral pneumonia and the
current therapeutic experience on severe type COVID-19, the storm of inflammatory
factors may be the main reason for rapid disease progression and poor treatment
response.6 7 13 In this study, by collecting data of severe cases of laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19 cases, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and inflammatory markers
in patients with severe type COVID-19 in Wuhan City to explore potential markers
for disease monitoring.

METHODS
Data source and collection
COVID-19 was diagnosed in accordance with the WHO interim guidance. A
confirmed case of was defined as positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on
high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assays of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Only
laboratory-confirmed cases were included in this study, while disease diagnosed based
on clinical presentation and imaging findings, but not on SARS-CoV-2 detection,
were excluded. The severity of COVID-19 was classified according to the Guidelines
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection (Trial
Version 5)

issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of

China. Severe case was defined when any of the following criteria was met: 1.
dyspnea, respiration rate (RR) ≥30 times / min; 2. oxygen saturation by pulse
oximeter ≤93% in resting state; 3. partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to
fraction of inspired oxgen (FiO2) ratio ≤300 mm Hg (l mm Hg=0.133kPa). We
collected data of 69 patients with severe type COVID-19 hospitalized in the
Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College,
Huazhong University of Science and Technology, between January 21 and February
16, 2020. A retrospective study on the clinical characteristics and laboratory

examination was conducted. 11 nonsevere COVID-19 patients were included for
comparison. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Tongji
Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Verbal consent
was obtained from patients before the enrollment. Written informed consent was
waived due to the urgent need data collection.
The clinical symptoms, physical signs and results of laboratory examination of
patients were recorded. Radiologic evaluation included chest computed tomography
(CT) scan. Laboratory tests included baseline whole blood cell count, blood chemistry,
coagulation

test,

C-reactive

protein

(CRP),

procalcitonin

(PCT),

lactate

dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), creatine kinase
(CK), and lymphocyte subset and cytokine profile analysis on admission. In addition,
cytokine profile follow-up was conducted in 30 severe type patients after treatment.
Treatment plan are recorded. Time from the symptom onset to initial treatment, initial
COVID-19 diagnosis, development of pneumonia evidenced by CT scan, and from
the diagnosis of pneumonia to discharge were recorded.

Laboratory diagnosis
Nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected and placed into a collection
tube containing preservation solution for virus10. Real-time RT-PCR assay for
SARS-CoV-2 was conducted by the viral nucleic acid detection kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai bio-germ Medical Technology, Co. Ltd.).
Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was performed by local Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in accordance with the Chinese CDC protocol.
Whenever needed, specimens, including sputum or alveolar lavatory fluid, blood,
urine and feces, were cultured to assess potential bacterial and/or fungal infection that
might accompany with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Flow cytometry and ELISA detection
The lymphocyte test kit (Beckman Coulter Inc., FL, USA) was used for lymphocyte
subset analysis by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumour

necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-γ) were detected by ELISA with human
Th1/2 cytokine kit II (BD Ltd., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). All tests were performed
according to the product manual.

Statistics
Continuous variables were described as means and standard deviations, or medians
and interquartile range (IQR) values. Categorical variables were expressed as counts
and percentages. Continuous variables were compared by the Mann Whitney U test.
Proportions for categorical variables were compared by the chi-square test and
Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Correlations were determined by Spearman rank
correlation analysis and Kendall correlation analysis. All statistical analyses were
performed by Graphpad Prism (version 5.0) and SPSS 26.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics
26.0). For all statistical analysis, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Demographic and clinical characteristics
A total of 69 severe cases were included. The median age was 56 years. Female
accounted for 52.17% of the enrolled cases. The smoking rate was 11.59%. Fever
(79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%) were
the most common symptoms, while diarrhea (15.94%), vomiting (7.25%) and sore
throat (5.80%) were relatively less common. 36.23% of patients had at least one
comorbidity (e.g., hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary
heart disease and hepatitis B virus infection), and there were four cases of tumor.
Another 11 nonsevere cases were also enrolled (table 1).

Radiologic and laboratory findings
Table 2 showed the radiologic and laboratory findings on admission. The most
common CT patterns in severe cases upon admission were bilateral patchy shadowing
(60.87%) and interstitial abnormalities (27.54%), while the common type mainly
manifested as focal ground glass opacity and patchy shadowing (54.5%) (table 2).

Baseline neutrocytopenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed
in 13.04%, 79.71% and 24.64% of the severe type patients, respectively. Lymphocyte
count in severe case was significantly less than the nonsevere cases (figure 1A).
Increased creatine kinase was present in 14.49% of the cases. Elevated level of
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase was more common and both
was detected in 37.68% of the cases (table 2).
For inflammatory parameters, abnormal baseline PCT was not common in both
nonsevere and severe patients. However, patients with severe disease showed more
common and more prominent level of D-dimer, ESR, LDH, CRP and ferritin than
those with nonsevere disease (figure 1B).

Treatment and clinical outcomes
89.86% of the severe type patients received antibiotics, 63.77% received antiviral
therapy (20.29% with oseltamivir, 52.17% with arbidol and 7.25% with
lopinavir/ritonavir), 42.03% received glucocorticoids and 50.72% received human
immunoglobulin (table 3). 55.07% of the severe cases needed oxygen therapy, among
which 27.54% received high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation or
invasive ventilation (table 3).
Among the enrolled patients with severe disease, 53.62% were cured and
discharged, 46.38% were still hospitalized, three patients (4.35%) needed transfer to
the intensive care unit and no death case occurred (table 3). Seven patients developed
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and one got septic shock (table 3).
Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, the time from symptom onset to
initial COVID-19 diagnosis and to development of pneumonia in patients with severe

＞

disease was shorter, but it was not significant (P 0.05) (figure 2A, B). There was no
significant difference in the time from symptom onset to treatment, and the time from
development of pneumonia to recovery in patients with severe disease was longer (P

＞0.05) ( figure 2C, D).

Immunological findings
The baseline proportion of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK)
cells, and the CD4+ T cells/CD8+ T cells ratio are basically within the normal range
(figure 1C). The baseline level of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ was within
normal range, while IL-10 was slightly increased (figure 1D).
The IL-6 level was increased significantly on admission in severe cases as
compared with the nonsevere cases (figure 1D). The baseline elevated IL-6 was
positively correlated with the bilateral and interstitial pulmonary involvement
(r=0.453, P=0.001) and closely related to the maximal body temperature during
hospitalization (r=0.521, P=0.000) (figure 3A), Meanwhile, it was significantly
related to the increase of CRP (r=0.781, P=0.001), LDH (r=0.749, P=0.001), ferritin
(r=0.606, P=0.001) and D-dimer (r=0.679, P=0.001) (figure 3B-E). We found
tendency showing that, on admission, the lower the IL-6 level, the shorter the time
lapse from diagnosis to cure (r=0.049, P=0.763), whereas the higher the IL-6 level,
the shorter the time lapse from symptom onset to pneumonia diagnosis (r= -0.116,
P=0.345). The elevated level of IL-6 was associated with the administration of
glucocorticords (r=0.301, P=0.001), human immunoglobulin (r=0.147, P=0.118), high
flow oxygen inhalation (r=0.251, P=0.007), mechanical ventilation during hospital
(r=0.223, P=0.017).
Among the 30 patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, 26
patients showed significantly reduced IL-6, which is accompanied with improved CT
assessments after treatment (figure 4A). Disease of the other four patients exacerbated
progressively. Among them, three patients showed persistent increase of IL-6 (figure
4B), while the change in IL-6 in one patient was not obvious. For this patient, there
was an increase in PCT level, and the progression of lung disease was confirmed as
bacterial, but not viral pneumonia, as evidenced by sputum culture positive for
bacterial infection (figure 4C). Eventually, with the remission of disease (figure 5),
the IL-6 level of this patient decreased significantly, and the D-dimer, CRP and LDH
level also decreased significantly, all of which were associated with the resolution of
clinical manifestation and CT images.

DISCUSSION
This study shows that most of the severe cases of COVID-19 have the initial
symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, while diarrhea is not
common. Compared with the nonsevere cases, the imaging findings mainly involve
bilateral and interstitial abnormalities. In patients with severe disease, more intensive
and supportive treatment, including glucocorticoids, human immunoglobulin,
interferon-α, antibiotics, antiviral therapy (oseltamivir and abidol) and oxygen therapy,
was administered and relieved symptoms were observed in most cases. The time from
initial symptoms to pneumonia in severe COVID-19 patients was shorter, the median
recovery time was longer, and the onset of severe type was more rapid than the
nonsevere patients.
Previous studies have suggested that lymphocytopenia and inflammatory cytokine
storm are associated with the severity of infections caused by highly pathogenic
coronavirus.4 6 7 14 15 Cytokines are signaling peptides, proteins, or glycoproteins that
are secreted by many cell types, including immune, epithelial, endothelial, and
smooth muscle cells. Cytokines allow context-dependent communication within the
body.13 If the interactions that lead to cytokine production are destabilized, a
"cytokine storm" can result, producing unbridled inflammation within tissues and key
organs.13 Cytokine storms are associated with sepsis and septic shock, influenza, acute
respiratory distress, and toxic response to medication and so on.6 9 15 IL-1, IL-6, IL-10,
and TNF-a have been implicated in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, the 2003 SARS
outbreak and the H5N1 avian influenza infections firstly recognized in 1987.6 15 16
Similarly, recent studies on COVID-19 patients have also reported a decrease in
peripheral blood lymphocyte count and an increase in serum inflammatory cytokine.10
11

Cytokine storms, which can rapidly cause single or multiple organ failure and

ultimately can be life-threatening, are considered to be an important cause of death in
patients with severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection can rapidly activate
pathogenic T cells and produce granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) and IL-6. GM-CSF will further activate CD14+CD16+ inflammatory

monocytes and produce more IL-6 and other inflammatory factors, resulting in a
cytokine storm that causes severe immune damage to the lungs and other organs.17
Results of this study indicated that compared with the common type, the changes in
immunological parameters and cytokine level in severe type COVID-19 are
inconspicuous. There was mild variation in IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN-γ before
and after treatment, all of which fluctuated within the normal range. However,
elevated CRP, ferritin, IL-6 and LDH were associated with more intensive and
prolonged treatment, which included glucocorticoids, human immunoglobulin,
stronger antibiotics, high flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. Collectively,
it showed that the above mentioned parameters were closely related to disease
severity.
Further analysis showed that the changes in IL-6 were closely related to the disease.
In this study, CRP, ferritin and IL-6, LDH decreased significantly after recovery. In
association with disease progression evidenced by exacerbating pulmonary lesions on
chest CT scan, IL-6 increased to a further degree, suggesting that IL-6 might be a
valuable candidate for monitoring severe type COVID-19. To our interest, in one
patient whose IL-6 level remained low as disease exacerbated, progression of
pulmonary lesions was caused by bacterial infection, which might suggest the
specificity of IL-6 in COVID-19.
IL-6 is synthesized by a variety of cells in the lung parenchyma, including alveolar
macrophages, type II pneumocytes, T lymphocytes and lung fibroblasts. IL-6 is a
pleiotropic cytokine important in regulating immunologic and inflammatory
responses.9

18

IL-6 being an acute phase inflammatory cytokine suggests that

measuring circulating IL-6 may reflect the inflammatory state of the lungs.7 18 This is
supported by the often observed increase of IL-6 in ARDS acute complications of
lung transplantation.9 12 19 20 Our findings that IL-6 elevated upon diagnosis and varied
correspondingly accordance with disease outcomes support a shared mechanism of
cytokine-mediated lung injury caused by virus. Siltuximab and tocilizumab are
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeted against IL-6 and its receptor (IL6R).21 22 Both
siltuximab and tocilizumab have been used to treat cytokine release syndrome

following chimeric antigen receptor–armed T cells (CART-19) therapy for leukemia.
Since we have found that IL-6 is related to COVID-19 severity, we suggest that
targeting IL-6 may ameliorate cytokine storm-related symptoms in severe COVID-19
cases.22 23
In conclusion, severe COVID-19 patients require more intensive treatment, and the
prognosis is relatively poor. IL-6 is positively correlated with disease severity, since it
decreases with the remission while increases with the aggravation of the disease.
Therefore, IL-6 may be an ideal marker of the disease monitoring. Targeting IL-6 may
be effective in treating inflammatory cytokine storm during disease progression. A
better understanding of the precise role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19,
especially in the severe cases, may help us manage the disease.

Figure 1 (A) Neutrophils and creatinine level from severe type COVID-19 patients
were in the normal range. Compared with nonsevere cases, lymphocytes decreased
while creatine kinase (CK) increased significantly in patients with severe
COVID-19. (B) The procalcitonin (PCT) of patients with severe COVID-19 was
basically normal, while the level of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin,
C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was
significantly increased. (C) Lymphocyte subgroup analysis showed that the proportion

（ ）

of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, natural kill NK cells and CD4+ T cells/CD8+
T cells ratio were within the normal range, and there was no significant difference
between the two groups. (D) Cytokine profile analysis showed that compared with
nonsevere type, there was no difference in the level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and IFN-γ,
while IL-10 increased slightly and IL-6 increased significantly in patients with severe
COVID-19.

Figure 2 Compared with nonsevere COVID-19 patients, (A) the time from symptom
onset to initial diagnosis (TFSD) and (B) the time from symptom onset to
development of pneumonia (TFSP) of patients with severe COVID-19 was shorter,

＞0.05). There was no difference in (C) the

but there was no significant difference (P

time from symptom onset to treatment (TFST) and (D) the time from development of

＞

pneumonia to recovery (TFPR) of patients with severe COVID-19 (P 0.05).

Figure 3 Correlation between baseline IL-6 level and clinical features of severe
COVID-19 patients. (A) The baseline IL-6 level was positively correlated with the
maximal body temperature during hospitalization. (B-E) The baseline IL-6 level was

positively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
ferritin and D-dimer.

Figure 4 Variation in IL-6 and chest computed tomography in severe COVID-19
patients. (A) The elevated baseline IL-6 was correlated with the severity assessed by
chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and the decrease in IL-6 after treatment was
positively correlated with the improvement in chest CT images. (B) Three patients
showed elevated IL-6 after treatment, which is associated with disease exacerbation
and progressed CT imaging. (C) The baseline IL-6 was 197.39 pg/mL in a 69-year-old
female patient who showed high fever and dyspnea. IL-6 decreased to 9.47 pg/mL
after treatment, but the symptoms were not relieved. CT scan was not performed due
to poor general condition, whereas chest X-ray showed aggravated pneumonia. The
C-reactive protein (CRP) rebounded and procalcitonin (PCT) increased significantly.
Follow up sputum culture confirmed the exacerbation was caused by bacterial
infection.

Figure 5 A 59-year-old male patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 on the fifth day
from the onset of fever. (A) The chest computed tomography (CT) was still normal
five days after symptom onset; and the patient presented with initial disease
aggravation evidenced by CT scan ten days after symptom onset displaying bilateral
multiple patchy ground glass opacities, and subsequent alleviation evidenced by
improved CT images 25 days after symptom onset. (B) The procalcitonin (PCT) level
had stayed in the normal range throughout the course of disease. (C) The lymphocyte
count was still normal five days after symptom onset. It reached nadir and returned to
normal during the disease course. (D-E) Similar trend of fluctuation was detected in
the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Both abnormal CRP
and IL-6 were detected five days after symptom onset when the chest CT was still
normal. In association with changes in CT scans, both CRP and IL-6 peaked ten days
after symptom onset and returned to normal 25 days after symptom onset. (F) The
body temperature correlated with the variation in CRP and IL-6, as it stayed abnormal
