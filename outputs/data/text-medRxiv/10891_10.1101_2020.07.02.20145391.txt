Abstract

17

Diabetes is one of the main comorbidities in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,

18

the causative agent of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because the presence

19

of diabetes and COVID-19 in the same patient is related to a poor clinical prognosis and a

20

high probability of death, it is necessary to determine what findings allow us to predict a

21

good or bad resolution of the disease in order to opt for a traditional treatment or a more

22

incisive one. In this way, in the present work we analyze which laboratory parameters showed

23

differences in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who recovered and in those who had

24

complications or died.

Introduction

28

The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by an infection with the SARS-

29

CoV-2 coronavirus. Severe cases of COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory

30

distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),

31

and ultimately patient death.1 In COVID-19 patients, diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the

32

main comorbidities associated with severe disease, ARDS, and increased mortality.2 This

33

relationship is due, in part, to the fact that patients with diabetes have a permanent pro-

34

inflammatory state that makes them more susceptible to an inflammatory cytokine storm,

35

often their innate immune system is compromised, and they also have an underlying

36

hypercoagulable pro-thrombotic state. Meanwhile, COVID-19 can worsen insulin resistance,

37

making it difficult to control glucose in people with diabetes, and also promotes strong

38

inflammatory and coagulation processes.3,4 Since establishing an early prognosis in patients

39

with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2 could help in their treatment decisions, in the

40

present work we analyzed which laboratory parameters showed differences that could predict

41

a good or bad resolution of the disease.

42

Material and Methods

43

We carry out an electronic search using different search engines such as Medline (PubMed

44

interface), Scopus, Web of Science via Raven and Google Scholar, using the keywords

45

"Diabetes + COVID-19" OR "Diabetes + SARS-CoV-2 ", without any date (until June 30,

46

2020) or language restrictions. The titles, abstracts and full texts of all the articles identified

47

according to these criteria were analyzed, considering for our meta-analysis only those that

48

reported prognostic data in patients with COVID-19 and diabetes (defined as with and

49

without the need to enter the intensive care unit, survivors and non-survivors or alive and

50

deceased).

51

Only four studies were considered in our meta-analysis5–8 and only the laboratory parameters

52

that appear in all articles were analyzed. The mean and standard deviation were extrapolated

53

from the median, range, and sample size as previously described.9 We analyzed whether there

54

are significant differences (p < 0.05) in the values of age, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c),

55

white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophils (NEU), lymphocytes (LYM), platelets (PLT), D-

56

dimer, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cr), C-reactive

57

protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and procalcitonin (PCT) between

58

patients who survived and those who presented complications or died. Meta‐analysis was

59

performed using Comprehensive Meta‐Analysis Software version 3 (2013, Biostat,

60

Englewood, NJ) calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) and the 95%

61

confidence interval (95% CI) of all parameters.

62

Results and Discussion

63

All the studies were conducted in the Chinese population, considering a total of 303 patients

64

with COVID-19 and diabetes, of whom 192 (63.36%) recovered without complications and

65

111 (36.63%) had complications or died. Samples between studies ranged from 28 to 153

66

patients. The SMD for each parameter is summarized in Figure 1. For most of the parameters,

67

a random effects model was used since its heterogeneity (I2 statistics) exceeded 50%, with

68

the exception of WBC and Cr where it was less and, therefore, a fixed effects model was

69

used. The results of our analysis showed that HbA1c (SMD = 0.545, 95% CI = -1.001 to

70

2.091), PLT (SMD = -1.117, 95% CI = -2.553 to 0.318) and ALT (SMD = 0.752, 95% CI =

71

-0.491 to 1.995) did not have significant differences between the two groups. Age (SMD =

72

1.686, 95% CI = 0.409 to 2.963), WBC (SMD = 2.002, 95% CI = 1.696 to 2.308), NEU

73

(SMD = 2.472, 95% CI = 1.833 to 3.110), D-dimer (SMD = 1.930, 95% CI = 1.262 to 2.599),

74

Cr (SMD = 1.482, 95% CI = 1.196 to 1.767), CRP (SMD = 3.244, 95% CI = 2.432 to 4.056),

75

NLR (SMD = 3.165, 95% CI = 2.216 to 4.115), PCT (SMD = 1.402, 95% CI = 0.516 to

76

2.289), and cTnI (SMD = 1.342, 95% CI = 0.192 to 2.492) showed higher values in patients

77

who had complications or died, while LYM (SMD = -2.577, 95% CI = -3.178 to -1.975)

78

values were higher in patients who survived. Notably, CRP, NLR, NEU, LYM and WBC

79

were the ones that presented the greatest differences between the groups.

80

Diabetes mellitus has been significantly associated with the mortality risk of patients with

81

COVID-19.10,11 In general, patients with COVID-19 and diabetes who presented a poor

82

prognosis showed higher levels of the inflammatory parameters, but at the same time an

83

immunocompromise due to the significant reduction in the number of lymphocytes.

84

Likewise, the parameters associated with coagulation and cardiac activity were increased in

85

patients who had complications or died. No parameter could be identified that was clearly

86

different between COVID-19 patients with diabetes and those without. Although blood

87

glucose control has been reported to reduce the risk of death and detrimental complications1,

88

we found no significant difference in HbA1c values, possibly due to good patient control

prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The CORONADO study reported that prior glucose control

90

does not have an impact on the severity of COVID-19 in people with diabetes.12 It is

91

important to mention that the presence of obesity was not reported in any of the studies

92

analyzed and the influence of BMI could not be investigated or included. Data on antidiabetic

93

therapy at baseline and during treatment are not considered, and it is unknown what

94

percentage of the population has uncontrolled diabetes.
