Abstract

Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require invasive mechanical
ventilation frequently meet the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnostic criteria.
Hospitals based in the United States have been incorporating prone positioning (PP) into the
COVID-19-related ARDS treatment plan at a higher rate than normal. Here, we describe 11
patients admitted to a single inpatient rehabilitation hospital who were subsequently diagnosed
with acquired focal/multifocal peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in association with the use of PP for
COVID-19-related ARDS. The reason for the high rate of PNI associated with PP in COVID-19
ARDS is likely multifactorial, but may include an underlying state of hyperinflammation and
hypercoagulability already linked to other the neurological sequelae of COVID-19. Physicians
must be aware of this elevated susceptibility to PNI in severe COVID-19 and refined standard
PP protocols in order to reduce the risk.

Introduction
Patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require invasive mechanical
ventilation frequently meet the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnostic criteria.
Both guidelines and expert opinion recommend 12 to 16 hours per day of prone positioning (PP)
for patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS from COVID-19 [1]. Many of the most severely
affected survivors from COVID-19 are now being discharged to inpatient rehabilitation (IPR)
hospitals [2]. This provides an important opportunity to assess the long-term sequelae of PP in
this unique patient population. Here, we describe 11 patients who were diagnosed with acquired
focal/multifocal peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in association with the use of PP for COVID-19related ARDS.
Methods
Study approval was granted by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Patients
were identified during their admission to a single IPR hospital (Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Chicago,
IL). Clinical suspicion of an acquired PNI was based on history and physical examination
performed on admission. Use of PP while patients were mechanically ventilated was confirmed
either through review of the medical record or, when records were not available, interview with
family members. Whenever possible the diagnosis of PNI was made by electromyography and
nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS). In one case, the localization of PNI was aided by
magnetic resonance neurography (Figure 1a). In another case, a patient was discharged
without EMG/NCS test completed due to the temporary closure of the electrodiagnostic
laboratory early in COVID-19 pandemic, so the diagnosis of PNI was made by physical exam.
Mean data values are expressed as plus or minus (±) standard deviation.
Results
Between 4/24/2020 and 6/30/2020, 85 patients were admitted to our IPR facility following
hospitalization for COVID-19-related ARDS. Of these, 11 patients (12.9%) were then diagnosed
with PNI. Demographic and clinical characteristics for these 11 patients are provided (Table 1).
Patients in our cohort received their care at six different acute care hospitals. All patients had
received PP while mechanically ventilated for COVID-19-related ARDS. The number of PP
sessions was 4.5 +/- 5.6 per patient and the number of hours spent in the prone position was
81.2 +/- 89.6 hours. The total duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 34.9 +/- 15.0 days.
In total, there were 18 separate PNIs across these 11 patients (1.6 ± 1.0 PNIs/patient). The vast
majority of these newly diagnosed PNIs occurred in the upper limb (83.3%; Figure 1). The most

frequent sites of injury included the ulnar nerve (5 cases, 27.7%), radial nerve (3 cases, 16.6%),
and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (3 cases, 16.6%). All patients had axontomesis type
PNI based on Seddon classification system, which ranged from moderate to severe in terms of
reduction in motor unit recruitment parameter on EMG/NCS.
Discussion

This report represents the single largest description of new PNIs associated with PP for
management of ARDS, and to our knowledge, the first description specific to COVID-19. PNIs
are a well-known, albeit uncommon positioning-related complication in perioperative medicine
reported to occur in 0.14% of surgical cases [3]. However, this has been rarely reported with PP
in the setting of ARDS. For example, the landmark PROSEVA trial does not even mention PNIs
as a complication of PP [4]. Hospitals based in the United States have been incorporating PP
into the COVID-19-related ARDS treatment plan at a higher rate than normal. The alarmingly
high prevalence of PNI in this cohort of IPR patients (12.9%) not only contributes to post
COVID-19 patient burden of disability, but raises the question as to why patients with COVID-19
ARDS are so vulnerable to PNI?

The reason for the high rate of PNI associated with PP in COVID-19 ARDS is likely
multifactorial. There were high rates of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and older age seen in our
cohort which are characteristics of severe COVID-19-related ARDS patients [5] as well as
established risk factors for PNIs [6]. COVID-19 has been associated with muscle injury, acute
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and a virus-induced state of hyperinflammation and
hypercoagulability which may play a role in the vulnerability of peripheral nerves in this patient
population [7]. An overlap in COVID-19 mechanisms with type II diabetes mellitus, which itself is
associated with neuropathies by a combination of immune, inflammatory, and vascular
involvement seems likely [8]. As the subjects described in this study presented from six different
tertiary care facilities, hospital specific approaches to PP cannot alone account for these PNIs.
Additionally, since only two patients are believed to have received greater than four PP sessions
(Table 1), it is unlikely that extreme duration of PP was the main cause of these PNIs. To put
this in perspective, the average number of PP sessions in PROSEVA trial was 4 [4].

To mitigate the PNI risk associated with PP for COVID-19-related ARDS, careful consideration
must be given to protection of the elbow, upper arm and shoulder given the distribution of
injuries reported here (Figure 1b). Reduction in the mechanical loads on peripheral nerves,

specifically avoiding positions of prolonged focal compression and/or stretching of nerves
should be an immediate focus. There are undoubtedly lessons to be learned from perioperative
medicine [9] to optimize positioning, frequency of repositioning, unloading and cushioning
susceptible nerve compression sites, as well as monitoring for early signs of focal injury by
visual inspection and physical examination. Ultrasound elastography may prove to be a useful
quantitative measurement tool for its sensitivity to increases in nerve tension and stiffness [10].
Limitations of this study include missing clinical data for some patients, the lack of a control
group, and its retrospective design which precludes establishment of a causal relationship
between PP and PNI in the setting of COVID-19-related ARDS.

In conclusion, PNI after PP for the management of severe COVID-19-related ARDS patients is
surprisingly common. Physicians must be aware of this elevated susceptibility to PNI in severe
COVID-19 and refined standard PP protocols in order to reduce the risk.
