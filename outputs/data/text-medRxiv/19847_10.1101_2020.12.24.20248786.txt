INTRODUCTION
Point of care diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, such as the ID NOW, have great potential to help
combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The ID NOW is approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic individuals within the
first 7 days of symptom onset for COVID-19 if tested within 1 hour of specimen collection.
However, clinical data on the performance of the ID NOW is limited, with many studies
deviating from the manufacturer’s instructions and/or having small sample size.
METHODS
Adults with COVID-19 in the community or hospital were recruited into the study. Paired throat
swabs were collected, with one throat swab transported immediately in an empty sterile tube to
the laboratory for ID NOW testing, and the other transported in universal transport media and
tested by an in-house SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay targeting the E-gene. Positive percent
agreement (PPA) was calculated.
RESULTS
133 individuals were included in the study. 129 samples were positive on either the ID NOW
and/or RT-PCR. Assuming any positive result on either assay represents a true positive, PPA of
the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with 95% confidence intervals was 89.1% [82.0% - 94.1%]
and 91.6% [85.1% - 95.9%], respectively. When analyzing individuals with symptoms ≤ 7 days
and who had the ID NOW performed within an hour, ID NOW PPA increased to 98.2%.
DISCUSSION
In this study, SARS-CoV-2 results from the ID NOW were reliable, especially when testing was
adhered to manufacturer’s recommendations.

INTRODUCTION

70

The ID NOW (Abbott, Illinois, United States) is approved by the United States Food and Drug

71

Administration (FDA) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2

72

(SARS-CoV-2) in individuals who are within the first 7 days of symptom onset. The assay

73

targets a region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2 for using

74

isothermal amplification and subsequent detection of fluorescence, with results available in

75

under 15 minutes. Clinical specimens approved for testing include nasal, throat, and

76

nasopharyngeal swabs. These specimens must be tested on the Abbott ID NOW either

77

immediately or within 1 hour of collection if stored in a clean, unused tube. Specimens placed in

78

viral/universal transport media (UTM) are not valid for testing on the Abbott ID NOW.1

79
80

Current limitations of the Abbott ID NOW include the lack of strong data to determine its

81

effectiveness in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical settings. To date, the studies used to obtain

82

FDA approval have not used clinical specimens. These studies have demonstrated that the limit

83

of detection of the Abbott ID NOW is similar to other nucleic acid amplification tests at

84

approximately 125 genome equivalents/mL. Of the clinical studies reported in the literature, the

85

Abbott ID NOW has been shown to have excellent specificity (~100%) but sensitivity varies

86

widely between studies (48.0% - 94.1%).2-17 In addition, many of these studies suffer from poor

87

study design such as comparing nasopharyngeal to nasal specimens, deviating from the product

88

insert or having major delays in testing specimens on the ID NOW. Only two studies adhered to

89

the FDA’s recommendations for ID NOW testing, and both studies had a small sample size (<20

90

samples positive for SARS-CoV-2).16,17

92

We sought to assess the positive percent agreement (PPA) of the ID NOW by comparing its

93

performance to an in-house validated real-time reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) among

94

individuals with recently confirmed COVID-19 while adhering as closely as possible to the

95

manufacturers recommendations. We also tested the accuracy of the ID NOW with samples

96

taken from asymptomatic individuals at low risk for COVID-19 (i.e. no exposures) and on

97

retrospective clinical samples previously positive for common respiratory pathogens.

99

METHODS

100

Testing individuals with confirmed COVID-19

101

Community and hospitalized individuals within the Calgary and Edmonton Health Zones of

102

Alberta, Canada, who recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Alberta Precision Laboratories

103

(APL) and confirmed as cases by Alberta Health Services (AHS) Public Health were recruited.

104

Diagnostic testing was performed by a Health Canada approved SARS-CoV-2 assay or a lab

105

developed real time RT-PCR assay (see below for details). Participants were identified by an

106

AHS Public Health confirmed case list. Oral consent by phone was obtained for collection of

107

samples in the participant’s home or in a hospital (if hospitalized). Individuals under the age of

108

18 and individuals in supportive or congregate living facilities were excluded. Eligible patients

109

who consented to the study were recruited to have two throat swabs collected by trained

110

healthcare professionals within their homes or inpatient unit. The University of Calgary Research

111

Ethics board approved this study (REB20-444).

112
113

Individuals were asked to confirm their symptoms and date of symptom onset at the time of

114

study swab collection. Healthcare workers performing the collection were given instructions on

how to perform throat swabs using the ClassiqSwabs (COPAN Diagnostics, California, United

116

States) and the throat swab provided in the ID NOW testing kits (Abbott, Illinois, United

117

States).18 Throat swabs were collected from both sides of the oropharynx and the posterior

118

pharyngeal wall under the uvula. Throat swabs were collected approximately one minute apart

119

and the order in which throat swabs were collected was recorded.

120
121

For each paired throat swab, one was placed into a dry 15mL conical centrifuge tube (Fisher

122

Scientific, MA, United States) for ID NOW testing and the other into a tube containing UTM

123

(COPAN) for RT-PCR testing. Samples were transported to the APL Public Health Laboratory

124

as quickly as possible, at room temperature, and tested upon receipt. Testing on the ID NOW

125

instrument was done immediately upon receipt as per manufacturer’s instructions. Throat swabs

126

in UTM collected for RT-PCR testing were stored at 4oC and tested within 72 hours. Two

127

hundred microliters of UTM were extracted on the MagMAX Express-96 or Kingfisher Flex

128

(ABI) using the MagMAX-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher) or the PurePrep Pathogen

129

Kit (MolGen) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted into a volume of 110ul. RT-

130

PCR testing included an assay targeting the envelope (E)-gene of SARS-CoV-2 developed and

131

validated at APL, and the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) test on

132

the Cobas 6800 instrument.19

133
134

For our lab-developed test, the samples were considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 when the

135

cycle threshold (Ct) value was <35. If the Ct was ≥35, amplification from the same eluate was

136

repeated in duplicate and was considered positive if at least 2/3 results had a Ct <41. Testing for

137

SARS-CoV-2 on the Cobas 6800 instrument was performed according to manufacturer’s

138

instructions. For the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, a positive result was defined as 2/2 targets

139

positive or 1 or more targets positive in duplicate. If 1/2 targets were positive and duplicate

140

testing was negative, the result was considered indeterminate.

141
142

For discrepant results, the specimens were retested in triplicate with our lab developed RT-PCR

143

test and in triplicate with the N2 assay from the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

144

Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel using the UltraPlex 1-Step Toughmix (Quantabio, MA,

145

USA).20 If still negative, the test was run on the Cobas 6800. PPA was calculated with Clopper-

146

Pearson 95% confidence intervals. Statistical analysis was performed using Pearson Chi-squared

147

for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables using STATA (version 14.1).

148
149

Negative samples and retrospective samples containing other respiratory viruses

150

Two throat swabs were collected from asymptomatic individuals at low risk of having COVID-

151

19 (no recent travel, no exposures). One throat swab was tested immediately (<2 minutes) on the

152

ID NOW instrument. The other throat swab was tested by RT-PCR as explained above. To

153

assess for cross-reactivity, retrospective samples containing high concentrations of various

154

respiratory viruses, stored in UTM, were tested by aliquoting 400uL of sample into the ID NOW

155

blue specimen receiver. These samples were previously tested by the NxTAG® Respiratory

156

Pathogen Panel (Luminex, Tx, United States) or the CDC influenza SARS-CoV-2 multiplex

157

assay . The ability of the ID NOW to process this volume of UTM was confirmed by testing four

158

retrospective positive SARS-CoV-2 samples, in UTM, and showing that they could be detected

159

(data not shown, Ct values ranging from 21 - 28).

RESULTS

162

One hundred and fifty-two patients were recruited for this study. Fourteen individuals were

163

asymptomatic at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and at time of study collection and were

164

therefore excluded from analysis (sub-analysis provided in the supplementary material). The date

165

of symptom onset for two individuals was not captured at time of consent and they could not be

166

reached later for clarification, and therefore excluded. Three samples were excluded as samples

167

were lost for RT-PCR testing (all were ID NOW positive). Symptom details were not recorded

168

for two individuals but they were still included in the analysis as symptom onset was known and

169

they were still symptomatic at the time of collection. This resulted in the inclusion of 133

170

individuals in our analysis and their characteristics are provided in Table 1.

171
172

All individuals had symptoms at the time of collection and the majority (91.0%) were from the

173

community. For the 131 individuals with recorded symptoms, cough was the most frequent

174

symptom (40.5%), followed by pharyngitis (31.3%), fevers/chills (30.5%), headache (24.4%),

175

nasal congestion (23.7%), anosmia (22.9%), malaise (21.4%), myalgias (21.4%), ageusia

176

(19.1%), shortness of breath (13.0%), rhinorrhea (11.5%), nausea/vomiting (3.8%) and other

177

including chest pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite or arthralgias (7.6%).

178
179

Mean duration of symptoms at the time of collection was 6.9 (median=7, range=1 – 17) days.

180

Seventy-five percent (n=100) of individuals were within the 7-day symptom onset window,

181

62.4% (n=83) of individuals had their samples tested on the ID NOW within 1 hour from

182

collection, and 46.6% (N=62) met the regulatory agency approved criteria for testing on the ID

183

NOW (symptom onset ≤ 7 days and ID NOW test conducted within an hour from collection).

184

The mean E-gene Ct value for positive results from the RT-PCR assay was 30.9 (median=31.0,

185

range=16.4 – 37.9).

186
187

Of the 133 samples, 96 were positive on both the ID NOW and RT-PCR (Table 2). Assuming

188

any positive result represents a true positive, the PPA of the ID NOW compared to RT-PCR with

189

95% confidence intervals was found to be 89.1% [82.0% - 94.1%] and 91.6% [85.1% - 95.9%],

190

respectively (Table 3). There were 13 false negatives on the ID NOW instrument, with 11/13

191

(91.7%) having Ct value > 30 on RT-PCR (or indeterminate on the Cobas 6800) and 6/13

192

(41.7%) with Ct values > 37 on RT-PCR (or indeterminate on the Cobas 6800) (Table 4). Eight

193

of the 13 false negative samples (61.5%) were from individuals within 7 days symptoms onset,

194

four (30.7%) were samples that were tested on the ID NOW within an hour from collection, and

195

only one (7.7%) was from an individual with symptoms ≤ 7 days and had the ID NOW

196

performed within an hour. Samples tested on the ID NOW instrument were more likely to be

197

positive if the sample was tested within one hour from collection (p=0.031) and from individuals

198

who had lower Ct values on RT-PCR testing (p<0.001) (Table 5). RT-PCR samples were more

199

likely to be positive if the sample was tested on individuals with symptoms ≤ 7 days (Table S2).

200
201

When tested in triplicate using RT-PCR followed by triplicate testing by the CDC method and

202

testing on the Cobas 6800, 5/10 (50.0%) RT-PCR negative samples, with paired positive ID

203

NOW swabs, resolved as positive. One sample was unable to undergo additional testing.

PPA between the ID NOW and RT-PCR, stratified based on individual characteristics, is

208

symptoms ≤ 7 days (91.2%), and in samples with ID NOW performed within an hour (89.8%).

209

Further details are provided within the supplementary material.

210
211

Twenty asymptomatic individuals at low risk of COVID-19 were tested, all of which were

212

negative on the ID NOW and RT-PCR. All four retrospective samples positive for SARS-CoV-2

213

were positive on the ID NOW. All 11 retrospective samples containing other respiratory viruses

214

tested were negative. These samples were previously positive for one of either human

215

metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, other coronavirus (NL63, HKU1, NL63),

216

enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A H3N2, influenza A H1N1, or influenza B.

DISCUSSION

220

Our study compared the PPA of the ID NOW to RT-PCR among individuals confirmed to have

221

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, PPA of the ID NOW instrument was high at 89.9% and

222

comparable to our laboratory’s RT-PCR (91.6%) for this population. In the cohort of patients

223

with symptom onset ≤ 7 days prior to collection, and whose samples could be tested within one

224

hour from collection, the PPA increased to 98.2%. While there were instances in our study where

225

the ID NOW was positive and the RT-PCR was negative, we believe these are true positives

226

based on several reasons. Participants recruited in our study were all recently diagnosed with

227

COVID-19; none of the samples from the asymptomatic individuals at low risk of COVID-19

228

gave false positive results throughout the study; when retested in triplicate or on an alternative

229

platform, 40% of these samples had detectable RNA present; and no issues with false positive

230

results have been identified by the ID NOW manufacturer or among previous publications within

231

the literature.2-17

232
233

PPA of the ID NOW varies widely in the literature from 48.0% to 94.1%.2-17 However, most of

234

these studies suffered from poor study design or were conducted when the manufacturer still

235

considered placing swabs in UTM as appropriate for sample collection (prior to April, 2020).

236

Several studies did not adhere to the recommended time limit of 1 hour for time of collection to

237

result which, as confirmed in this study, is a statistically significant factor in ID NOW’s

238

performance.2,11,15 One of the major studies to discredit the performance of the ID NOW

239

compared dry nasal swabs (tested on the ID NOW) to nasopharyngeal swabs (tested on Cepheid

240

Xpert Xpress), which is an inappropriate comparison given the superiority of positivity rate

241

among nasopharyngeal specimens to nasal specimens.19,21 Furthermore, Basu et al. tested

242

patients with symptom onset up to 1 month from time of sample collection, and it is unclear how

243

many patients with confirmed COVID-19 had symptoms ≤ 7 days.3 Among the studies that

244

adhered to current ID NOW manufacturer recommendations for testing, ID NOW PPA was

245

66.7% and 94.1%.16,17 However, both studies had small sample sizes (<20 samples positive for

246

SARS-CoV-2).

247
248

Limitations of our study include the low number of hospitalized patients recruited such that we

249

cannot make strong conclusions about the ID NOW performance among this population. The

250

majority of throat swabs tested on the ID NOW were collected before the comparator swab

251

(78.0%). However, we did not observe any difference in ID NOW or RT-PCR positivity rate

252

when comparing patients who had ID NOW throat swab collected first vs second (Table 5 and

10

253

supplementary material). There were discrepancies between ID NOW positive, RT-PCR negative

254

specimens, that could have resulted from multiple factors, such as intra-collector variability in

255

the throat swab collections and degradation of virus during transportation/storage, as opposed to

256

false positive ID NOW results.

257
258

The strengths of our study include the large number of COVID-19 positive individuals recruited,

259

particularly those residing within the community. We adhered to the manufacturer’s

260

recommendations, as much as possible, to recruit COVID-19 positive individuals with symptoms

261

≤ 7 days at time of collection and to test samples on the ID NOW within an hour from collection.

262

Adhering to these requirements was difficult, as it often took several days from symptom onset

263

for an individual in the community to get swabbed and test results reported. Consequently, the

264

symptom onset was often near seven days. Meeting the one-hour criteria was challenging as we

265

had to drive back and forth from participants’ households to our laboratory, and many

266

participants were located in distant parts of the city (e.g. >30 min drive to the laboratory) and

267

other obstacles (e.g. traffic) increased transit time. Another strength of our study was the

268

concurrent testing of asymptomatic individuals at low risk of COVID-19, and retrospective

269

samples positive for other respiratory viruses, throughout the study to ensure there were no

270

issues with false positive results (e.g. caused by contamination or cross-reactivity).

271
272

CONCLUSIONS

273

In conclusion, the ID NOW was found to be a comparable method to our RT-PCR for the

274

detection of SARS-CoV-2 among individuals with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. PPA was

275

enhanced when tested on individuals with symptom onset ≤ 7 days and when time from

276

collection to testing was within one hour. These results reassure us that the ID NOW is a reliable

277

test method in symptomatic individuals, especially when adhering to the FDA-approved

278

indications and recommendations for testing. Given the speed and low-complexity of ID NOW

279

testing, these instruments can truly be used as a point of care device. As such, they will play an

280

impactful role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic by improving testing in settings where

281

low-volume rapid (<1h) turnaround times are much needed, such as among difficult to reach

282

populations (e.g. homeless), inpatients with suspected nosocomial infection, and in rural areas

283

where access to a laboratory is limited because transportation delays are significant.
