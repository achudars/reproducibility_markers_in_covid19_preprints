Long-term Coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 with Antibody Response
17

Abstract

18

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection causing coronavirus

19

disease 2019 has spread worldwide. Whether antibodies are important for the adaptive

20

immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be determined. Here, 26

21

cases of COVID-19 in Jinan, China, were examined and shown to be mild or with

22

common clinical symptoms and no cases of severe symptoms were found among

23

these patients. A striking feature of some patients is that SARS-CoV-2 could exist in

24

patients who have virus-specific IgG antibodies for a very long period, with two cases

25

for up to 50 days. One COVID-19 patient who did not produce any

26

SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2 after 46 days of illness,

27

revealing that without antibody-mediated adaptive immunity, innate immunity may

28

still be powerful enough to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this report may provide a

29

basis for further analysis of both innate and adaptive immunity in SARS-CoV-2

30

clearance, especially in non-severe cases. This study also has implications for

31

understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

Long-term Coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 with Antibody Response
36

The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

37

outbreak was reported in December 2019, and the virus has rapidly spread worldwide

38

within 3 months (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The importance

39

of innate and adaptive immunity in the defense against SARS-CoV-1 needs to be

40

urgently determined (Thevarajan et al., 2020). To fulfill the pressing need, we

41

examined

A total of 26 patients from 5 to 72 years old were determined to be SARS-CoV-2

52

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies act as an indicator of recent and past

53

infection, while IgM antibodies indicate current infection. SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG

54

antibodies were detected in the serum of patients. For patients 3, 7, 22 and 24 (Table

55

1), SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid measurements became negative before antibodies were

56

detected. Although IgG antibody testing was positive for the first trial in all 4 patients,

57

we could not determine the exact role of IgG antibodies in SARS-CoV-2 clearance

Long-term Coexistence of SARS-CoV-2 with Antibody Response
58

because innate immunity is also sufficient to eliminate this virus (refer to the case of

59

patient 26). However, the results did reveal that the antibodies are produced early and

60

SARS-CoV-2 is cleared up, indicating that the immediate production of antibodies

61

may contribute to virus clearance.

62
63

Interestingly, we observed that specimens from patients 2, 8, 13, and 16 who had

64

been confirmed to be IgG positive still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid

65

for more than 35 days (Table 1), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 can coexist with its

66

specific antibodies in the human body for an unexpectedly long time (36-50 days).

67

According to the data collected from patient 2, IgG antibodies can be produced at

68

least as early as the 7th day post illness. (Table 1). The average number of days for

69

SARS-CoV-2-bound IgG antibodies to be first detected in the 4 patients was 15; thus,

70

the early production of antibodies does not mean early elimination of this virus. The

71

production of specific antibodies is believed to be effective for virus clearance (Jiang,

72

2020; Lu, 2020), but we could not reach such a conclusion from these cases. We did

73

not observe a correlation between early adaptive immune responses and better clinical

74

outcomes. Perhaps the specificity and titer of antibodies are more important. To our

75

knowledge, to date, this is the longest period (36-50 days) to observe the coexistence

76

of SARS-CoV-2 with its specific antibodies in COVID-19 patients. How this virus

77

can circulate in the presence of specific antibodies for such a long time is an

78

interesting question. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can act as HCV that have developed

79

strategies to subvert humoral immunity and persists in the body is worth further

investigation (Elsner et al., 2015; Fafi-Kremer et al., 2012; Takaya et al., 2019). These

81

3 patients were all 23-39−year-old adults, which may suggest that young adult

82

individuals do not have obvious advantages in the early production of antibodies and

83

the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 compared to older persons (patients 10 and 21).

84
85

We observed that patient 26, a 5-10−year-old female, was SARS-CoV-2 nucleic

86

acid positive in a stool sample after 46 days of illness but became nucleic acid testing

87

negative in specimens of sputum, stool, and nasopharyngeal swabs on day 47 post

88

illness (Table 1). No SARS-CoV-2−specific antibodies were detected in the patient’s

89

serum until the last sample collection day, which was the 66th day post illness.

90

Although we did not collect data about virus-specific cellular immunity, it is known

91

that cellular immunity is generated concomitantly with humoral immunity, so we

92

could preliminarily exclude the potential role of cellular immunity in SARS-CoV-2

93

elimination in this case. Thus, from the data on patient 26, we may conclude that

94

innate immunity, the first line of host defense, can play an essential role in

95

SARS-CoV-2 clearance; moreover, innate immunity alone might be enough to clear

96

the virus. This case may also indicate that some individuals may not generate specific

97

antibodies after infection with SARS-CoV-2; thus, only testing SARS-CoV-2−specific

98

antibodies is not a good standard to determine infection, but combination with the

99

nucleic acid testing method may improve the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection.

100
101

Patient 25, another 5-10 year-old female, was found to be IgG antibody positive

on the 10th day post illness, and the patient turned SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative

103

on 23rd day post illness (Table 1). We also observed that a 5-10 year-old female

104

patient (patient 7) produced IgG antibodies on the 14th day post illness, and this

105

patient turned SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative on the 28th day post illness (Table

106

1). These 2 cases may reveal that children do not show any defects in antibody

107

production and SARS-CoV-2 elimination compared with adults.

108
109

Although a vaccine is believed to be the ultimate preventive measure against

110

SARS-CoV-2 spread, generating a broadly protective and universal vaccine can take a

111

long time (Lu, 2020). In this study, in the case of patient 26 (Table 1), we observed

112

that innate immunity alone may be enough to completely clear SARS-CoV-2 infection.

113

This is the first report that innate immunity plays such an essential role in the host

114

defense against SARS-CoV-2, which highlights the importance of innate immunity in

115

SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Further studies are required to determine which factors or

116

signaling pathways of innate immunity contribute to this process. Whether individuals

117

with such responses are still at risk for reinfection needs further exploration. Similar

118

to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be detected by endosomal Toll-like

119

receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors or other RNA sensors that

120

activate NLRP3 signaling, leading to the production of IFNs, ISGs, and

121

proinflammatory cytokines (Kasumba and Grandvaux, 2019). Boosting innate

122

immune signaling pathways, such as the TLR3 and RIG-I pathways, by drugs that

123

mimic viral RNA may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 clearance (Kasumba and

Grandvaux, 2019). However, these immune stimulators also induce an inflammatory

125

response that may be harmful to patients; thus, antiviral immunity should be

126

maximized, and inflammatory responses must be minimized. The inflammatory

127

response that is responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids contributes to

128

SARSinduced lung injury (Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). As immune

129

stimulators, viral RNA mimics also induce an inflammatory response that may be

130

harmful to patients; thus, a strategy, in which antiviral immunity should be maximized

131

and inflammatory responses must be minimized, is challenging. Vaccine combined

132

with innate immune stimulators may be more effective for fast SARS-CoV-2

133

clearance. We propose that the importance of innate immunity should be investigated

134

further and that the titer and specificity of SARS-CoV-2−specific antibodies are

135

important and should be seriously considered in vaccine development.

136
137

Our study is limited by the current reagents used in this study, which cannot be

138

used to determine the titer and specificity of human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

139

The titer of specific antibodies correlated with clinical outcomes remains to be

140

investigated. The long-term coexistence of IgG antibody with SARS-CoV-2 in the

141

human body raises the question of whether patients with antibodies are still at risk for

142

reinfection. Our follow-up studies may answer this question and would, therefore, be

143

beneficial to vaccine development. Second, we did not collect the earliest serum of

144

patients, and we could not determine on which day the SARS-CoV-2 bound IgG

145

antibodies were generated. Thus, we could not observe the dynamic changes in IgG

antibodies during illness and recovery. Third, we lack severe patients as controls;

147

therefore, we do not know whether the adaptive immunity of severe patients can

148

respond earlier because of their strong immune response and whether they can clear

149

the virus faster after antibodies are produced. Despite that, our study provided several

150

novel pieces of information about the innate and adaptive immune response against

151

SARS-CoV-2: SARS-CoV-2 bound IgG antibodies can be generated as early as 7 days

152

post illness but can coexist with SARS-CoV-2 in patients long-term (up to 50 days);

153

without SARS-CoV-2 bound IgG antibodies, innate immunity can also successfully

154

clear this virus.
