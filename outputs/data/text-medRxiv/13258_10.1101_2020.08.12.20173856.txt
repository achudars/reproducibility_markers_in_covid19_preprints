Abstract:
IgG immunoassays have been developed and used widely for clinical samples and
serosurveys

for

SARS-CoV-2.

We

compared

the

performance

of

three

immunoassays, an in-house RBD assay, and two commercial assays, the Diasorin
LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA which detects antibodies against S1/S2 domains of
the Spike protein and the Zydus Kavach assay based on inactivated virus using a
well-characterized sera-panel. 379 sera/plasma samples from RT-PCR positive
individuals >20 days of illness in symptomatic or RT-PCR positivity in asymptomatic
individuals and 184 pre-pandemic samples were used. The sensitivity of the assays
were 84.7, 82.6 and 75.7 respectively for RBD, LIAISON and Kavach. Kavach and
the in-house RBD ELISA showed a specificity of 99.5% and 100%, respectively. The
RBD

and

LIAISON

(S1/S2)

assays

showed

high

agreement

(94.7%;95%CI:92.0,96.6) and were able to correctly identify more positives than
Kavach. All three assays are suitable for serosurveillance studies, but in low
prevalence sites, estimation of exposure may require adjustment based on our
findings.

Introduction

2

Nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests like RT-PCR have shown considerable sensitivity

3

and specificity for detection of active SARS-CoV-2 infections and are being used as the

4

primary diagnostic tool. Serological tests, on the other hand, are important tools for

5

estimation of seroprevalence of the disease at a community level. At an individual level,

6

serological evidence may be a correlate of exposure or vaccine response.

7

Performance characteristics of serological tests determine their utility and interpretation

8

of results. For SARS-CoV2, many tests have been developed but there are limited

9

direct comparisons. Approximately 390 tests for IgG, IgM, IgA and total antibody have

10

been developed across a range of platforms including chemiluminescence, magnetic

11

bead-based assays, microwell ELISA, lateral flow, etc. using different portions of the

12

spike and nucleocapsid proteins as well as whole inactivated virus [1]. Although the

13

nucleocapsid is more abundant and immunogenic, most assays in use or in

14

development have utilized different regions of the spike protein or whole virus as the

15

capture reagent in immunoassays. This is mainly because anti- spike antibodies are

16

believed to be less cross-reactive based on viral spike homology and are expected to

17

correlate better with neutralizing capacity of convalescent sera. Most of these assays

18

have been developed rapidly, many under emergency use authorization, and hence

19

were evaluated by the developers in a limited set of samples. The performance of these

20

assays in larger sample sets in various real-world setting is necessary to interpret the

21

results of the seroepidemiological studies conducted using these assays.

2
22

In this study, we evaluate three serological tests, one in-house ELISA, a commercial

23

ELISA, and a commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay and report their sensitivity

24

based on 379 RT-PCR positive convalescent sera and plasma samples collected from a

25

prospective cohort of COVID-19 positive participants and specificity based on 184 pre-

26

pandemic participants. We also perform head-to-head analyses of their ability to

27

correctly identify IgG positive samples.

28

Materials and Methods

29

Participants for serological assay comparison

30

The participants for this study were derived from a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19

31

positive participants known as the Department of Biotechnology India COVID-19

32

Consortium cohort, with ongoing recruitment from March 2020 at eight clinical sites in

33

the Delhi- National Capital Region, India. The participants in this cohort are derived from

34

two types of enrollment: i) Suspected COVID-19 patients enrolled at the time of RT-

35

PCR testing at the screening center and ii) RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive

36

patients admitted at one of the clinical sites. The testing by RT-PCR was done at an

37

approved laboratory as per the National Testing Strategy of India [2]. The RT-PCR

38

confirmed COVID-19 patients were followed up at 10-28 days and 6-8 weeks of onset of

39

illness. During the enrollment and follow-up detailed clinical information on the exposure

40

history, clinical features and comorbidities were documented. Venous blood samples

41

are collected, transported, processed and stored per protocol [3]. All enrollments were

42

made after an informed consent process and the study protocol was approved by the

43

Institute Ethics Committees of the participating research institutes and hospitals.

3
44

The COVID-19 positive reference standard sera panel (n=379) was formed using the

45

sera/plasma samples collected ≥20 days of illness or following RT-PCR positivity. This

46

criterion is in alignment with the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory

47

Agency (MHRA) to improve comparability [4,5]. The duration of illness for asymptomatic

48

participants was calculated from their date of diagnosis. For symptomatic participants, it

49

was calculated from the date of testing or date of onset of symptoms whichever was the

50

earlier. The COVID-19 negative standard panel was built from sera samples collected in

51

the pre-pandemic period (184 from pregnant women enrolled in a pregnancy cohort) to

52

ensure a clean set of negative samples[4–6].

53

Index test methods and alternate reference tests

54

Index test: THSTI In-house RBD IgG ELISA

55

SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was diluted to 2µg/ml in PBS pH 7.4 and 50 µl/well was

56

coated on maxisorp polystyrene plate (Thermo Scientific). Plates were incubated at 4 °C

57

for overnight. Next day, the wells were washed 3 times with PBST (PBS with 0.1%

58

Tween 20) using 96-well plate-washer (Tecan AG). Two hundred microliter of blocking

59

solution (PBST with 3% skim milk) was added to all the wells. The Plates were

60

incubated at 20°C for 2 hours. After 2 hours of incubation, plates were removed from

61

the incubator and the blocking solution was thrown off. Hundred microliter of diluted test

62

serum or control samples (1:50 dilution in PBST with 1% skim milk) were added to the

63

appropriate wells and the plates were incubated at 20oC. After 2 hours of incubation,

64

plates were removed from the incubator and washed 3 times with PBST. Horse Radish

65

Peroxidase labeled goat anti-Human IgG Fcγ-sp. Tracer antibody (Jackson Immuno

4
66

Research, Pennsylvania, USA) was diluted 1:5000 in PBST with 1% skim milk and 50 µl

67

of diluted tracer was added in each well of the plates. Plates were incubated in a 20oC

68

incubator for 1 hour. After the completion of the incubation period, plates were washed

69

3 times with PBST and in each well 100µl of TMB substrate (BD Biosciences) was

70

added and plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in dark. Fifty microliter

71

of stop solution (1M H 2 SO 4 ) was added in each well and the absorbance was measured

72

using a microplate reader (Biorad, California, USA) at 450 nm with 650 nm as reference

73

wavelength. In each assay, 8 known negative samples with variable background were

74

used as control to calculate the cut-off value. The cut-off value was calculated using the

75

formula: Cut-off = Average OD value of negative control samples + 3* SD of OD value

76

of negative control samples

77

Covid Kavach IgG ELISA

78

Covid Kavach IgG ELISA was developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research’s

79

National Institute of Virology, and manufactured by Zydus [7]. The test was performed

80

as per manufacturer’s instructions. The kit suggests interpretation of the results by a

81

two-pronged method, based on OD value and P/N (Positive/Negative Ratio). When both

82

read-outs are in agreement, then the sample is considered positive or negative. The

83

manufacturer’s instruction does not mention interpretation for samples with a read-out

84

not in agreement for the two criteria. We considered such results negative.

85

DiaSorin CLIA

86

The LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG chemiluminescence assay manufactured by

87

DiaSorin was also used for comparison. This test uses S1/S2 antigens to capture

5
88

specific IgG antibodies. The test was performed as per manufacturer’s instructions, with

89

calibration and positive and negative controls run before each batch of antibody testing

90

as per manufacturer's protocol [8]. The tests were considered positive when the IgG

91

concentration was ≥15 AU/mL, negative when the concentration was <12 AU/mL and

92

equivocal when the concentration was >12 and <15 AU/mL. Equivocal samples were

93

considered negative for sensitivity analysis.

94

Statistical analysis

95

In the absence of a gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays, an alternate

96

reference standard was used for this study, which is SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positivity

97

with >20 days duration of illness (symptomatic) or >20 days beyond RT-PCR positivity

98

(asymptomatic). While comparing the three assays, we report sensitivity and specificity

99

of each test with the positive and negative reference standards as defined. In addition,

100

we performed a head-to-head analysis for agreement between these methods. We

101

estimated the global agreement calculated as the sum of the number of positives by

102

both methods and number negative by both divided by the total number of samples. We

103

estimated the bias index defined as the difference in the proportion of positivity for any

104

bias between the methods to check whether one method was superior to the other in

105

correctly identifying positive samples. As the prevalence of positives and negatives may

106

play a role in the interpretation of the kappa statistic, we report the prevalence index

107

defined as difference between probability of positives and probability of negatives. We

108

finally report the kappa statistic adjusted for prevalence and bias known as prevalence

109

and bias-adjusted kappa [9]. We then compared the sensitivity of the three candidate

110

tests across different periods of illness. All analyses were done using the STATA-SE-15

6
111

software (Texas, USA) and the Kappa coefficient and related indices were estimated

112

using Cohenkap package for STATA [10].

113

Results

114

Samples defined by an Alternate Reference Standard used for comparative evaluation

115

The reference true positive sample panel consisted of 379 samples from 368

116

participants; 11 of whom provided two samples at different time-points. The distribution

117

of the duration of illness was bimodal owing to the design of the cohort from which the

118

samples were derived. The means of the sampling window distributions are 23.5 and

119

49.3 days respectively (Supplementary figure 2). Most samples (83.7%) were obtained

120

from symptomatic individuals. Nearly half of the samples were sera, rest were plasma.

121

The reference negative panel consisted of 184 pre-pandemic samples collected before

122

September 2019.

123
124

Comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of candidate assays

125

Among the three candidate tests, RBD IgG ELISA demonstrated the highest sensitivity

126

(84.7; 95%CI: 80.6 - 88.1) and Zydus Kavach the least (75.7; 95%CI: 71.0 - 79.9).

127

Zydus Kavach is interpreted as positive when both test parameters were positive based

128

on cut-0ff and P/N ratio. Six samples were indeterminate in Zydus Kavach test; and 25

129

samples were positive only by one condition (Cut-off, P/N ratio) by Zydus Kavach.

130

Seven samples were reported as indeterminate by DiaSorin CLIA. When Zydus Kavach

131

was interpreted as positive with one of the two criteria, 25 additional samples were

132

identified as positive, improving the sensitivity to 81.8%. The sensitivities of the tests did

133

not change with the increase in the duration of illness beyond 20 days (Supplementary

7
134

table 5). The specificities of Zydus Kavach and RBD ELISA were 99.5 and 100%

135

respectively (Table-1, Figure-1). The specificity of DiaSorin could not be evaluated due

136

to limited availability of pre-pandemic negative sera.

148

Comparison of Zydus-Kavach, DiaSorin CLIA & RBD ELISA

149

When evaluated for agreement between the tests, DiaSorin CLIA and RBD ELISA had

150

highest concordance with a global agreement 0f 94.7% (95%CI: 92.0, 96.6). There was

151

minimal bias between the two tests; with just 6 samples positive with DiaSorin labelled

152

negative by RBD ELISA. Among the other 14 discordant samples that were positive by

153

RBD ELISA, five were equivocal by DiaSorin and the rest were negative. The

154

agreement estimated by prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa statistic (0.89) was near

155

perfect between the two tests (Table-2 & Supplementary table-4).

9
156

On the other hand, head-to-head comparison of DiaSorin CLIA and RBD ELISA against

157

Zydus Kavach demonstrated that the degrees of agreement were modest. The global

158

agreement between the pairs of DiaSorin CLIA and Zydus Kavach, and RBD ELISA and

159

Zydus Kavach were 88.7% (95%CI: 85.1, 91.5) and 87.3% (95%CI: 83.6, 90.3)

160

respectively (Table-2). DiaSorin CLIA and RBD ELISA were superior to Zydus Kavach

161

ELISA and were able to correctly identify 7% and 9% more IgG positive sera than the

162

latter (Supplementary tables 2 & 3).

Discussion

170

Comparison of three assays on a well-characterized sample set showed that the

171

DiaSorin CLIA and the in-house RBD ELISA performed slightly better than the Zydus

172

Kavach ELISA with higher sensitivity and ability to identify more IgG positive samples.

173

These results are important as they help interpretation of the serosurveillance studies

174

that are being conducted in India using these tests.

175

The sensitivities reported in our study are less than reported by the companies or

176

elsewhere [5,7]. An independent evaluation of DiaSorin CLIA, the sensitivity was

177

reported to be 95.0% (95%CI: 92.8, 96.7), which is at least 13 percentage points higher

178

than this report [3]. While unlikely, this difference could be attributed to false positives

179

in our RT-PCR assay since we used RT-PCR positive convalescent samples as

180

reference standards. Similarly, the article reporting internal validation of Zydus Kavach

181

ELISA reported a sensitivity of 92.37% based on samples that were positive in a micro-

182

neutralization assay as against 75.7% that we see in our study using sera collected >20

183

days post-RT-PCR positivity [7]. While we harmonised our definition of positive

184

reference standard with that of the UK MHRA, about 14% of our participants were

185

asymptomatic, and may have had a lower antibody response as reported in a

186

longitudinal study, albeit with small numbers, which showed that 2/24 of their

187

participants did not seroconvert when followed up 20-28 days into their illness [11].

188

To overcome the limitation of an imperfect positive reference standard and to improve

189

inferences, the relative performance of these tests was evaluated by head-to-head

190

comparison. RBD ELISA and DiaSorin CLIA were able to identify more positive IgG

11
191

sera/plasma than Zydus Kavach. However, RBD ELISA is an in-house ELISA

192

developed using similar sample collections. While the sample panel used for evaluation

193

was independent of that used in the development of the RBD ELISA, its true test would

194

be when it is evaluated externally.

195

Highly sensitive serological assays can assess immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and

196

are needed to determine the extent of spread of the virus, which in turn is critical for

197

assessing case fatality rates and herd immunity. Serological assays also help in

198

assessing development of herd immunity to devise community management strategies

199

that are of crucial importance at this time, and will continue to be relevant in the coming

200

years. Other uses of serological assays can be to assess exposure in high-risk

201

populations such as healthcare workers and assess vaccination strategy at state or

202

national level. Cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV and seasonal coronaviruses in different

203

population and timing of IgM and IgG responses need to continue to be considered. Till

204

date, studies on comparative performance serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 show a

205

range of sensitivity of 84-98% and specificity of 96-99% [12–29]. Two of the three IgG

206

assays in this study used the Spike protein (Receptor binding domain or RBD in THSTI-

207

In-house ELISA and S1/S2 in DiaSorin CLIA), while the specific antigenic epitope(s) of

208

the inactivated virus in the Kavach assay are not defined. Since RBD in the spike

209

protein is the major site of ACE-2 binding, assays with this target may have more

210

concordance with neutralizing antibodies. The spike protein has more CD4 and CD8 T

211

cell immunodominant epitopes as experimentally shown in SARS-CoV, and since these

212

epitopes are mostly conserved even in SARS-CoV-2 isolates, serological assays

12
213

targeting RBD or full length S1/S2 are putatively more appropriate for assessing long-

214

term immune status [30].

215

Conclusion:

216

Overall, this is the first comparative study of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays in India evaluated

217

independently against a strategically designated alternate reference standard. One

218

limitation of this study is that we were unable to evaluate the specificity of the Diasorin

219

assay due to paucity of negative samples. Nonetheless, the well characterized panels

220

provide useful information for decision-making for choice of serological assays.
