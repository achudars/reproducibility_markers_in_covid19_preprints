Abstract:
Introduction: COVID-19 pandemic has caused havoc worldwide, and different
comorbidities have been seen to exacerbate the condition. Obesity is one of the leading
comorbidities, which is associated with many other diseases. In this paper, we present a
systematic review and meta-analysis estimating the effects of overweight and obesity on
COVID-19 disease severity.
Methodology: Two electronic databases (Medline and Cochrane library) and one grey
literature database (Grey Literature Report) were searched using the following keywords:
overweight, obesity, body mass index, respiratory disease, coronavirus, COVID-19. The risks
of bias of the selected studies were assessed by using the Navigation Guide method for
human data. Both random and fixed effect meta-analysis were determined using Review
Manager (RevMan) software version 5.4.
Results: After initial screening, 12 studies (7 cohort studies, four case-control studies, and
one cross-sectional study) were fulfilled the eligibility criteria, comprising a total of 405359
patients and included in the systematic review. The pooled risk of disease severity was 1.31
times higher based on both fixed and random effect model among those overweight patients,
I2 0% and 2.09 and 2.41 times higher based on fixed and random effect respectively among
obese patients, I2 42% compared to healthy individuals.
Conclusion: Overweight and obesity are common risk factors for disease severity of
COVID-19 patients. However, further assessment of metabolic parameters included BMI,
waist-hip ratio, and insulin levels, are required to estimate the risk factors of COVID-19
patients and understanding the mechanism between COVID-19 and body mass index.
Keywords: COVID-19; Overweight; Obesity; BMI

Introduction:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019)—caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus—was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization on March 11, 2020 (1). As of December 1, 2020, COVID-19 has infected 61.8
million people worldwide, with a death toll of 1.4 million (2). Previously, two highly
pathogenic Coronaviruses resulted in outbreaks of a severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in 2003 in Guangdong province, China, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) in Middle Eastern countries in 2012 (3-6). Multiple risk factors are associated with
mortality in COVID-19 patients. An increasing body of data suggests that individuals with
diabetes mellitus (7), hypertension, and severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) are more likely to
be infected and are at a higher risk for complications and death from COVID-19 (8-14). In
China, it was found that patients with cardiovascular disease (10.5%) had the highest fatality
rate than diabetes mellitus (7.3%), hypertension (6.0%), and cancer (5.6%) (15). Many
countries mentioned body mass index (BMI) as a clinical risk factor of COVID-19, such as
China (16), Italy (17), United States (9) as the immunity system plays a vital role in obesityinduced adipose tissue inflammation (11). Emerging literature suggests that adults with
obesity under the age of 60 are more likely to be hospitalized (18). The prevalence of obesity
among adults is increasing day by day due to insufficient physical activities. A previous study
showed a strong correlation between obesity and complications of viral infections (influenza
virus, SARS, and MERS) (19). Many studies found that excessive weight gain ≥18 kg may
increase the risk of developing community-acquired pneumonia (7, 20). Severe obesity might
increase the duration of hospital stay and the case fatality rate (14, 21). However, two earlier
reports have suggested no difference in body mass index (BMI) between severe and nonsevere groups (18, 22). Although several studies addressed the impact of the body mass index
(BMI) on COVID19, a definite conclusion has not been drawn yet. Hence, this metaanalysis was conducted to elucidate the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 by
searching existing literature.
Methods:
Literature Search: We searched two electronic databases: MEDLINE (on October 20, 2020)
and Cochrane library (on October 21, 2020). We also searched one grey literature database:
Grey Literature Report (http://greylit.org) on October 21, 2020. Searches were performed
using a search strategy in English. We searched the literature using the following keywords:
overweight, obesity, body mass index, respiratory disease, coronavirus, COVID-19. Manual
searching was also performed to identify potentially eligible studies.
Study selection: All articles found in the searches were downloaded, and duplicate articles
were identified and excluded. Two independent authors screened the titles and abstracts for
finding duplicates and then screened the full texts to select the eligible articles. If there were
any disagreements between the review authors, a third author fixed the problems. Following
the PRISMA guideline, the process of study selection is presented in a flow chart (Figure 1).

systematic review and meta-analysis.
Eligibility criteria: PECO definitions are described below:
• Population: We included all studies of people aged (≥ 15 years) and reported positive
for the presence of coronavirus in their bodies by the RT-PCR technique. Studies that
measured the body mass index (BMI) were included with standard procedure.
• Exposures: Studies that defined overweight and obesity with standard definition were
included.
• Comparators: Healthy participants with optimum BMI were used as a comparator.
All other comparators were excluded.
• Outcomes: Severity of disease was used as an outcome in this systematic review.

Types of study: We included studies that measured the effect of overweight and obesity on
COVID-19 disease severity. Eligible studies were randomized control trials, cohort studies
(both prospective and retrospective), and case-control studies. We also included observational
study. Records published in English were included. Both published and unpublished studies
were included. Studies conducted using unethical practices were excluded.
Types of effect measures: We included measures of the relative effect of overweight and
obesity on the severity of disease (prevalence and incidence), compared with the patient with
optimum BMI. We included relative effect measures such as RRs, ORs, and Hazard ratios.
To facilitate meta-analysis, if a study presented an RR, then it was converted to OR. If a
study presented estimates for effect from two or more alternative models that had been
adjusted for different variables, then we systematically prioritized the estimate from the
model that provided information on the relevant confounders or mediators, at least the core
variables: age, sex, and socioeconomic position. We prioritized estimates from models
adjusted for more potential confounders over those from models adjusted for fewer. For
example, if a study presents estimates from a crude, unadjusted model (Model A), a model
adjusted for one potential confounder (e.g., age; Model B) and a model adjusted for two
potential confounders (e.g., age and sex; Model C), then we prioritized the estimate from
Model C.
Data extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted the data on study characters (study
authors, study country, population size, study year, exposure, and outcome), study design,
and risk of bias (including source population representation, blinding, exposure assessment,
outcome assessment, confounding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting,
conflict of interest and other sources of bias).
Risk of bias assessment: There is no standard method of assessing the risk of bias of selected
studies for doing systematic review. The risk of bias of this review was assessed by nine risk
factors of bias included in the Navigation Guide method for human data. These were: (i)
source population representation; (ii) blinding; (iii) exposure assessment; (iv) outcome
assessment; (v) confounding; (vi) incomplete outcome data; (vii) selective outcome reporting;
(viii) conflict of interest; and (23) other sources of bias. The ratings for all domains were:
“low”; “unclear” and “high.” Two independent reviewers assessed the risk of bias of selected
studies. Any disagreement was solved by the third reviewer. Funnel plots were generated to
judge concerns on publication bias (Supplementary figures).
Statistical Analysis: We assessed heterogeneity by reporting the I2 (% residual variation due
to heterogeneity) and tau2 (method of moments estimates of between-study variance) of the
pooled estimate. Both random effect and fixed-effect models were used to measure the
relationship between obesity and COVID-19 disease severity. The 95% confidence interval
has been reported in a pooled analysis. All analysis was done by using Review Manager
(RevMan) software version 5.4.
Result:
Study selection: A total of 193 individual studies were identified in our searches. Twelve
studies fulfilled our eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review (Figure 1).

Of the 12 included studies (24-35), nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (24, 2630, 32, 34, 35).
Characteristics of included studies: Most of the studies were cohort studies (7 studies),
followed by case-control studies (4 studies) and one cross-sectional analysis. The total
population of the included studies was 405359. The most commonly studied countries were
the United States (6 studies) and China (4 studies). The comparator of most studied was
BMI≤ 25kg/m2 (Table 1).
Nine studies reported the relation between COVID-19 disease severity with overweight and
obesity (Table 3).
Risk of bias at individual study level: The risks of bias rating for each domain for all 12
studies for this outcome are presented in Table 2.
Measured outcome: The effect of overweight on disease severity of COVID-19 patients was
measured comparing with normal body weight. The meta-analysis of selected nine studies
showed that the pooled risk of disease severity was 1.31 times higher based on both fixed and

random effect model among those patients who were overweight, I2 0% (Figure 2 and 3).

Discussion:
Of the 41 studies examined, some studies failed to find any association between BMI and
COVID-19 (25, 27), and some studies did not measure BMI as a risk factor of COVID-19.
The present study accumulated all the findings related to COVID-19 and BMI. Interestingly,
it was found that BMI is a risk factor for COVID-19 patients. Overweight patients were 1.31
times higher at the risk of disease severity of COVID-19, and obese patients were 2.09 and
2.41 times higher susceptible to the severity of COVID-19 according to fixed and random
effect model, respectively. Our study result is consistent with what has been found in
previous reports (36-40). Different studies previously documented for different viral
pathogens, including influenza, that obesity was a major risk factor for disease severity (4143). During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it was found that the rates of hospitalization and
deaths were higher among overweight and obese patients (7).
Several parameters with overweight and obesity play a role in disease severity of COVID-19.
However, there is no exact mechanism that explains the contribution of overweight and
obesity to severe COVID-19 outcomes. Nevertheless, it is said that obesity has adverse
effects on lung function, diminishing forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity (44).
It is also reported that respiratory physiology is changed by obesity with the decreased
functional capacity of the respiratory system (45). Another study found that obesity impaired
immune system surveillance and response (46). Obesity was also found to impair the
respiratory function, gas exchange, lung volume, increase comorbidities (CVD, T2D, kidney
disease), and metabolic risk (hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia), which
contributed to disease severity of COVID-19 patients (47). Some studies explained why
obese people presented a worse clinical outcome than a normal patient. These studies
concluded that overweight and obese people have a different innate and adaptive immune
response and have higher leptin and lower adiponectin concentrations, which leads to
dysregulation of immune response and contributes to worsening pathogenesis conditions (4850). Another study found that obesity reduced the activity of macrophages when an antigen is
presented (51). Obesity was also directly associated with basal inflammatory status
characterized by higher circulating Interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein levels (44). Obesity
also impaired the adaptive immune system responses to the influenza virus (52). It is crucial
to understand and find out the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 to reduce the risk
of developing severe COVID-19 illness. The lifestyle of people should be improved to lessen
risk both in the current and subsequent waves of COVID-19.

Conclusion:
Further assessment of metabolic parameters, including BMI, waist-hip ratio, and insulin
levels, are required to estimate the risk factors of COVID-19 patients. Obesity is a common
risk factor of numerous comorbidities that increase the severity of COVID-19 disease. So, we
recommend that additional attention should be given to obese patients, along with other
patients during this epidemic.
