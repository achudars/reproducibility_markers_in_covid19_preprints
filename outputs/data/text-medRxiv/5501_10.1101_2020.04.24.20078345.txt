Abstract: We analyze confirmed cases and new hospitalizations in Wisconsin in the weeks
surrounding the April 7, 2020 election, and find no evidence of a surge in SARS-CoV-2
transmission.
The April 7, 2020 Wisconsin election produced a large natural experiment to help
understand the transmission risks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Up to 300,000 people voted in person [1-2] and waiting times in Milwaukee
averaged 1.5-2 hr [3]. Poll workers had surgical masks and latex gloves, hand sanitizer was
made available to voters, isopropyl alcohol wipes were used to clean voting equipment, and
painting tape and signs were used to facilitate social distancing [2].
Wisconsin tracks cases confirmed by testing (Fig. 1A) and throughout April 2020 have
restricted testing to frontline workers and those hospitalized with serious illness [4]. We
used a deconvolution-based method to reconstruct the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve by
dates of infections rather than dates of reporting by health authorities, and then used two
different methods [5]-[6] to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number ùëÖ" , which is
the average number of secondary cases generated by one primary case with the time of
infection on day ùë°, from March 25 (the start of the safer-at-home order) through April 18
(see the Supplementary Appendix).
As seen in Fig. 1B, there is no detectable spike in ùëÖ" on April 7. The number of SARS-CoV-2
tests performed in Wisconsin has been relatively stable throughout April [7] (Fig. 1C),
suggesting that reduced testing capacity in the days after April 7, which could have
censored some of the April 7 infections, did not occur. Moreover, new SARS-CoV-2
hospitalizations in Wisconsin have steadily declined throughout April (Fig. 1D), from a high
of 101 on April 3 to a low of 14 on April 18 [7], suggesting that daily new hospitalizations
are much less than testing capacity.
The lengths of the incubation period and the reporting delay imply that April 7 infections
would not be reported until April 17 on average, with most cases being reported during
April 11-22. Taken together, there is no evidence to date that there was a surge of
infections due to the April 7, 2020 election in Wisconsin, which has a relatively low level of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the US.

Finally, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services announced on April 22 that 19 people
who either voted in person or worked at the polls on April 7 have tested positive for SARSCoV-2, although several of these people also experienced non-voting exposures [8]. This
fact is not inconsistent with our population-level analysis, because 19 cases is small relative
to the total number of confirmed cases in Wisconsin. To put this information into
perspective, if we assume that the SARS-CoV-2 fatality rate among symptomatic patients
who were physically capable of voting in person on April 7 (e.g., not including nursing
home residents) is 1% (using the fatality rate of known cases for people aged <60 [9]), then
we would expect 0.19 deaths out of 300,000 people, which is the fatality risk of driving an
automobile approximately 50 miles [10]. However, in addition to the individual risk of
voting on April 7, there is the community risk: how many downstream cases will these 19
original cases generate? According to Fig. 1B, the reproduction number in Wisconsin has
been hovering near the value of one for all of April. If this value was much larger than one
(as it was in, say, January) then these 19 cases would cause a lot of downstream damage,
and if this value was clearly smaller than one then they would cause minimal damage. But a
value near one, coupled with the small number of cases, means that it is very difficult to
reliably predict the amount of downstream damage.
Taken together, it appears that voting in Wisconsin on April 7 was a low-risk activity.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 Dynamics Surrounding the April 7, 2020 Election in Wisconsin.
Panel A shows the number of daily confirmed SARS-CoV2 cases in Wisconsin from March
15 to April 19. Panel B shows the estimated instantaneous reproduction number ùëÖ" (along
with 95% confidence intervals) each day from March 25 (the start of the safer-at-homeorder in Wisconsin) to April 18 using two different methods. Panel C shows the number of
SARS-CoV-2 tests performed each day from March 15 to April 18. Panel D shows the
number of new SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations in Wisconsin on each day from March 30 to
April 18. In generating the curve in Panel C, a possible mis-entry in the original data set [4]
led to the cumulative test count on March 29 being smaller than the day prior; in response,
we replaced the March 29 cumulative case count by the average value between March 28
and 30.

SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX
The instantaneous reproductive number ùëÖ" was defined as the average number of
secondary cases generated by one primary case with the time of infection on day ùë°. If ùëÖ" >
1 the epidemic is expanding at time ùë°, whereas ùëÖ" < 1 indicates that the epidemic size is
shrinking at time ùë°.
Since the epidemic curve of Wisconsin is based on the dates of test confirmation, we use a
deconvolution-based method to reconstruct the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve by dates of
infection [1-2]. Let ùëì)*+,-.")/* be the probability density function (pdf) of the incubation

assume the incubation period distribution is gamma with mean and SD of 5.2 and 2.3 days

is gamma with mean and standard deviation (SD) of 4.3 and 3.2 days, based on 186 cases
reported in Jan-Feb 2020 in Beijing [4]. With the epidemic curve by dates of infection in
hand, we applied two different methods -- developed by Wallinga and Teunis [5] and by
Cori et al. [6] -- to estimate ùëÖ" using the R package EpiEstim. We assume the generation
