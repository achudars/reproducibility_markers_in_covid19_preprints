Summary

45

Objective : The objective of this study was to monitor the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in

46

infected patients.

47

Methods : In order to assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30 COVID-

48

19 inpatients and monitored the detection kinetics of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N

49

antibodies with in-house ELISAs. We also monitored the presence of neutralizing antibodies in

50

these samples as well as 25 asymptomatic carrier samples using retroviral particles pseudotyped

51

with the spike of the SARS-CoV-2.

52

Results : We observed that specific antibodies were detectable in all inpatients two weeks post-

53

symptom onset. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and RBD was more sensitive

54

than the detection of the S1 or S2 subunits. Neutralizing antibodies reached a plateau two weeks

55

post-symptom onset and then declined in the majority of inpatients. Furthermore, neutralizing

56

antibodies were undetectable in 56% of asymptomatic carriers.

57

Conclusions : Our results raise questions concerning the role played by neutralizing antibodies in

58

COVID-19 cure and protection against secondary infection. They also suggest that induction of

59

neutralizing antibodies is not the only strategy to adopt for the development of a vaccine. Finally,

60

they imply that anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies should be titrated to optimize

61

convalescent plasma therapy.

Background

69

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently

70

emerged and caused a human pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).1-3 Among the

71

coronaviruses structural proteins, the Spike (S) and the Nucleocapsid (N) proteins are the main

72

immunogens.4 The S protein consists of two subunits, S1 which contains the Receptor Binding

73

Domain (RBD) and S2. The kinetics of antibody detection is essential for the selection of

74

commercial serological assays and the interpretation of the results. Some manufacturers have

75

decided to target the S1 and/or S2 subunits whereas others chose the RBD or the N protein.

76

Furthermore, the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response against the SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly

77

documented and it is still unknown how long cured patients will be protected against new

78

infection.5,6 The objective of our study was thus to monitor the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

79

response in infected patients.

Study design

82

Study population and specimen

83

Thirty patients diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab

84

sample, between 25 February and 23 March 2020 at the Amiens University Medical Center, were

85

enrolled in the study. The general information was extracted from electronic medical records and

86

the clinical characteristics of the 30 inpatients are described in Supplementary Table 1. Inpatients

87

were considered as having mild disease when needing non-intensive care or severe disease when

88

needing intensive care. Samples from patients diagnosed positive for other human coronaviruses

89

(OC43 (n=5), 229E (n=4), NL63 (n=2) or HKU1 (n=1)) were also tested (Supplementary Table 2).

90

Finally, we also used samples from 25 asymptomatic carriers (Supplementary Table 3) that were

91

diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive using commercial serological tests (LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 IgG

92

from DiaSorin and/or ELISA SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) from EUROIMMUN). All plasmas were

99

Wells were blocked with 1% fetal bovine serum for 1 hour at 37°C. Then, 100 µL of diluted plasmas

100

(1:100 for S1, S2 and RBD or 1:200 for N) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After washing

101

4 times, plates were incubated with peroxydase conjugated mouse anti-human IgG (Southern

102

Biotech, 1/6000). After 4 washes, 100 µL of o-phenylenediamine peroxidase substrate was added

103

at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped with H2SO4 solution 15 min later. The

104

optical density was measured at 490 nm. All samples were run in triplicate. To establish the

105

specificity of each assay, 40 pre-pandemic sera from 2019 were tested. Each cut-off values were

Neutralization assay

109

Retroviral particles pseudotyped with the S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-

110

111

sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (accession number: MN908947). Supernatants

112

containing the pseudotyped particles were harvested at 48, 72 and 96 h after transfection, pooled

113

and filtered through 0.45-m pore-sized membranes. Neutralization assays were performed by

114

preincubating SARS-CoV-2pp and diluted plasma for 1 h at room temperature before contact with

115

Vero cells (ATCC® CCL-81™) that were transiently transfected with the plasmids pcDNA3.1-

116

hACE2 and pcDNA3.1-TMPRSS2 48 h before inoculation. Luciferase activities were measured

117

72 h post-infection, as indicated by the manufacturer (Promega). The NAb titers were deﬁned as

118

the highest dilution of plasma which resulted in a 90% decrease of the infectivity. Retroviral

Results

129

Antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 infected inpatients

130

In order to accurately assess the time of seroconversion, we used 151 samples from 30

131

patients hospitalized at the Amiens University Medical Center for a COVID-19 (see Supplementary

132

Table 1) and monitored the kinetics of detection of anti-S1, anti-S2, anti-RBD and anti-N

133

antibodies with in-house ELISAs. Importantly, plasmas from twelve patients that had previously

134

been infected with other coronaviruses (OC43 (n=5), 229E (n=4), NL63 (n=2) or HKU1 (n=1))

135

showed minimal cross-reactivity, which highlights the specificity of these assays (Supplementary

136

Table 2). We observed that antibodies targeting the N protein and the RBD were the earliest to be

137

detected (Fig. 1A). Thirteen days post-symptom onset, 100% of inpatients had detectable

138

antibodies to both proteins. A similar profile was observed for anti-S2 antibodies but with a mean

139

time lag of two days. Antibodies to the S1 subunit were the last to be detected and remained

140

undetectable for two inpatients. High levels of anti-N and anti-RBD antibodies were detected in

141

the large majority of samples obtained fourteen days post-symptom onset whereas very

142

heterogeneous levels of anti-S1 antibodies were found in the same samples (Fig. 1B). The

143

correlations between each ELISA are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 and clearly demonstrate that

144

detection of the N protein and/or the RBD is more sensitive than the detection of the S1

145

(Supplementary Fig. 1B and 1C) or the S2 subunit (see Supplementary Fig. 1D and 1E).

146

Significant differences were observed between mild disease versus severe disease patients for

147

anti-S1, anti-S2 and anti-N antibody levels, from eight days post-symptom onset (Supplementary

148

Fig. 2A). A slight difference was observed for anti-N antibody levels according to the sex, from

149

fourteen days post-symptom onset (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Finally, a significant difference was

150

observed for anti-S1 and anti-S2 antibodies according to the age, between eight and fourteen

151

days post-symptom onset (Supplementary Fig. 2C).

152
153

NAb response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 inpatients

154

We also monitored the presence of NAbs in all plasma samples using SARS-CoV-2pp.7

155

Importantly, Ni et al. recently demonstrated that there was a significantly positive correlation in the

156

NAb titers between such pseudotyped particles and the native SARS-CoV-2.8 The results obtained

157

for each inpatient are presented in Fig. 2. One sample of each inpatient was also used to perform

158

dose-response curves with VSVpp and no inhibition was observed, demonstrating that the

159

neutralization observed with the COVID-19 inpatient plasmas was specific to the SARS-CoV-2

160

(Supplementary Fig. 3A). Furthermore, plasmas from the twelve patients that had previously been

161

infected with other coronaviruses did not have any effect on SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infectivity

162

(Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3B). As expected, our results demonstrate that

163

the NAb production kinetic correlates with the production of antibodies targeting the S1, S2

164

subunits as well as the RBD and we detected NAbs in all COVID-19 inpatients fifteen days post-

165

symptom onset (Fig. 1A). The NAb titers increased from one week post-symptom onset and

166

reached a plateau one week after (Fig. 3). However, the NAb titers reached were variable between

167

inpatients, 17% generated low levels of NAbs (40 ≤ titers < 160), 73% intermediate levels (160 ≤

168

titers < 1280) and 10% high levels (1280 ≤ titers) (Fig. 3A). We also had the opportunity to monitor

169

the presence of NAbs in late samples of eleven inpatients (≥40 days post-symptom onset) and we

170

observed that the NAb titer dropped to low or undetectable level in most of these samples

171

(Fig. 3B). Significantly higher NAb titers were observed in inpatients with severe forms (p=0.04;

172

Supplementary Fig. 4A) and in women (p=0.03; Supplementary Fig. 4B) from 14 days post-

173

symptom onset. In contrast, no significant difference was observed according to the age

174

(Supplementary Fig. 4C). Furthermore, we found poor correlations between NAb titers and anti-

175

S1 (r=0.4573), anti-S2 (r=0.3852), anti-N (r=0.3629) or anti-RBD (r=0.3277) antibody levels, as

176

well as white blood cells (r=0.2384) and lymphocytes counts (r=0.3696) (Fig. 4).

177
178

SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in asymptomatic carrier samples

179

Finally, we monitored the presence of NAbs in plasma samples from 25 asymptomatic

180

carriers. It is important to note that we could not establish when these patients had been infected

181

since they were asymptomatic but it probably occurred more than one week before sampling since

182

they were confirmed seropositive using commercial serological assays as well as in-house ELISAs

183

(Supplementary Table 3). As shown in Fig. 5, NAbs were below the detection limit of our assay in

184

the majority of these plasma samples (56%, 14/25). Low NAb levels (40 ≤ titers < 160) were found

185

in 28% of these patients (7/25). Three patients had intermediate NAb levels (160 ≤ titers < 1280)

186

and only one showed a high NAb titer (≥1280).

187
188

Discussion

189

Commercial serological assays that are complementary to direct viral detection of the

190

SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR have recently become available but they need to be finely evaluated.9,10

191

We only tested IgG detection since recent data showed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels increase

192

at the same time or earlier than IgM levels.11 With our four in-house ELISAs, we showed that the

193

detection of the RBD and the N protein may be more suitable since it was highly or slightly more

194

sensitive than the detection of S1 or S2, respectively. The presence of cryptic epitopes in the RBD

195

could explain why in some cases anti-RBD antibodies are detected whereas anti-S1 antibodies

196

are not.12

197

As other groups, we also report that COVID-19 patients generate variable levels of NAbs

198

that reach a plateau two weeks post-symptom onset without correlation with clinical courses.8,13-

199

16

200

immune system may play a more important role in COVID-19 cure. Our results also indicate that

201

the SARS-CoV-2 does not induce a prolonged neutralizing antibody response since we observed

202

a drop of the NAb titer for several patients a few weeks after infection, which has also been

203

observed by Wang et al. on a small cohort.14 Furthermore, we observed that most of asymptomatic

204

carriers do not generate NAbs. The longevity of the protection against reinfection is thus

205

questionable. However, the immunological memory would certainly protect against severe disease

206

if reinfection would occur. These results also suggest that induction of NAb production is not the

207

only strategy to adopt for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Finally, since we observed

208

poor correlations between NAb titers and S1, S2, RBD or N binding, our results imply that anti-

209

SARS-CoV-2 NAbs should be titrated to optimize convalescent plasma therapy.17,18

This raises questions concerning the role played by NAbs and suggest that other arms of the
