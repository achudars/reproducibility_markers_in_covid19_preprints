Abstract
Background: Molecular tests are the mainstay for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, their accessibility can be limited by the long
examination time and inability to evaluate multiple samples at once. This study evaluated the
analytical performance of the newly developed rapid molecular assays GENECUBE® HQ
SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE® FLU A/B.
Method: This prospective study was conducted between December 14, 2020, and January 9,
2021, at a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) center. Samples were collected from the
nasopharynx with flocked swabs. Molecular tests were performed with the GENECUBE®
system and reference reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and the results of the two assays were
compared.
Result: Among 1065 samples, 81 (7.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the reference RTPCR. Three showed discordance between GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference
RT-PCR; the total, positive and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.7%,
100%, and 99.7%, respectively. All discordant cases were positive for GENECUBE ® HQ
SARS-CoV-2 and negative for the reference RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 was detected from all three
samples by another molecular assay for SARS-CoV-2. For the GENECUBE® FLU A/B, the
total, positive and negative samples of concordance for the two assays were 99.5%, 100%, and
99.1%.
Conclusion: The GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE® FLU A/B demonstrated
sufficient analytical performance to detect SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus A/B.

Key points: We prospectively evaluated the analytical performance of the newly developed
rapid molecular assays GENECUBE ® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE® FLU A/B. The
two assays showed >99% concordance rate compared with a reference PCR, which indicated

1 Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread worldwide [1]. The healthcare
system was globally inundated with COVID-19 patients and suffered a detrimental burden [1].
During the pandemic, the timely and accurate identification of patients with SARS-CoV-2 is
essential for early isolation and treatment [2].
Several guidelines have recommended nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) be
performed for SARS-CoV-2 testing due to their high sensitivity and specificity [3,4]. However,
it usually takes several hours to days to obtain results for NAATs [5], and few NAATs can
concurrently detect other respiratory viruses sharing similar manifestations as SARS-CoV-2
[6]. These drawbacks can limit their accessibility and utility in the clinical setting.
GENECUBE® (TOYOBO Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) is a rapid, fully automated genetic
analyzer that uses the Qprobe-PCR method [7]. The system automatically prepares reaction
mixtures and amplifies and detects target genes in a short time, which, in a single run, can
analyze up to eight samples and four items at the same time. GENECUBE ® has been applied
for several pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis [8], M. avium, M. intracellulare,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae [9], Chlamydia trachomatis [9], Mycoplasma pneumoniae [7,10],
Staphylococcus aureus (nuc and mecA) [11] and the toxin gene of Clostridiodes difficile [12].
To evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B virus, the authors of the present study
(HS and AS) created two new molecular assays named the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2
and GENECUBE® FLU A/B, which were approved in Japan in October and December 2020,
respectively. The GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE® FLU A/B can be
performed simultaneously or independently within approximately 25 minutes using purified or
heat-inactivated respiratory samples.
In this study, we evaluated the analytical performance of GENECUBE ® HQ SARS5

CoV-2 and the GENECUBE® FLU A/B.

2 Methods
A prospective comparison between the GENECUBE® examination and reference realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was performed with nasopharyngeal samples
obtained between December 14, 2020, and January 9, 2021, at a PCR center in Tsukuba, Ibaraki
Prefecture, Japan. During the COVID-19 endemic period, sample-collecting for PCR in the
Tsukuba district was intensively performed with a drive-through-type method at the PCR center
in Tsukuba Medical Center Hospital (TMCH) following a referral from a local public health
center and 63 primary care facilities and among healthcare workers at TMCH. Due to the low
prevalence rate of influenza and lack of fresh influenza virus-positive samples, we used
preserved Universal Transport MediumTM (UTMTM) samples that had been stored at -80 °C
and used in our previous study [13].
The ethics committee of TMCH approved the present study (approval number: 2020046), and informed consent was obtained from patients for their participation in the part of the
current research using fresh samples.

2.1 Sample collection and procedures for comparisons
For sample collections, we obtained a nasopharyngeal sample for PCR with
FLOQSwabTM (Copan Italia S.p.A., Brescia, Italy) as previously described [14]. The swab
sample was diluted in 3 mL of UTM TM (Copan Italia S.p.A.), and the UTMTM was then
transferred to a microbiology laboratory located next to the drive-through sample-collecting
place of the PCR center.
After obtaining the UTMTM samples, purification and RNA extraction were performed
with a magLEAD 6gC (Precision System Science Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) from 200-µL

aliquots of UTMTM, and the RNA was eluted in 100 µL for GENECUBE® and reference realtime reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using the LightCycler® 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) and a method developed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases
(NIID), Japan for SARS-CoV-2 [15]. The quality of extraction compared with the QIAamp®
Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN N.V., Hilden, Germany) is summarized in Supplementary Table
1. In the present study, a duplicate analysis for N2 genes was performed for the evaluation of
SARS-CoV-2.
If discordance was recognized between GENECUBE® and the reference real-time RTPCR, a re-evaluation was performed with an Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and GeneXpert®
(Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for SARS-CoV-2 [16] and with the Biofire® FilmArray®
Respiratory Panel version 2.1 (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) for the influenza
virus [17]. As an additional comparison, heat extraction was performed for GENECUBE ® HQ
SARS-CoV-2 and compared with the reference real-time RT-PCR in this study.

2.2 The GENECUBE® assay evaluation with the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and
GENECUBE® FLU A/B
The GENECUBE® can analyze SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus simultaneously
or independently based on the examiner’s request using the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2
and GENECUBE® FLU A/B. The RT-PCR conditions were as follows: reverse transcription
reaction 42 °C for 2 min, denaturation at 97 °C for 15 s, and 50 cycles of 97 °C for 1 s, 58 °C
for 3 s and 63 °C for 5 s. The RT-PCR products were subjected to a melting point analysis, the
conditions of which were as follows: 94 °C for 30 s and 39 °C for 30 s, followed by heating
from 40 °C to 75 °C in increments of 0.40 °C/s. Data were analyzed automatically and
displayed on the GENECUBE® monitor after completion of the assay evaluation.
For the GENECUBE® examination with the heat extraction method, 100-µL aliquots

of UTMTM were mixed with 10 μL of protease K solution (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo,
Japan) and heated at 65 °C for 5 minutes and 95 °C for 5 minutes. The inactivated samples
were diluted with an equal volume of lysis buffer and used for the assay evaluation.

2.3 Evaluation of the limit of detection (LOD) and the feasibility of pooled testing for the
GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2
To evaluate the LOD, twelve fresh SARS-CoV-2-positive UTMTM samples obtained
within three days before the evaluation were measured for their viral loads and diluted with
UTMTM to approximate concentrations of <100 copies/test and <10 copies/test. In total, 24
positive samples were prepared for the evaluation of LODs and measured in quadruplicate for
three examination methods: the reference RT-PCR method, GENECUBE® with the automated
purification method, and GENECUBE® with the heat extraction method. Fresh positive
influenza virus UTMTM samples were not obtained during the study, and the LOD study was
not performed for GENECUE® FLU A/B at present.
The feasibility of pooled testing for the GENECUBE ® HQ SARS-CoV-2 was also
evaluated. A pool size of 5 was chosen according to the protocol for pooled sample testing for
COVID-19 established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. For the pooled
analysis, 60 pooled samples were prepared: 20 of 5 pooled negative samples, 20 of 4 pooled
negative samples and 1 low viral load samples (30 < Ct value < 35), 20 of 4 pooled negative
samples, and 1 moderate to high viral load sample (Ct value < 30). The RNA was extracted
with a magLEAD 6gC from 200-µL aliquots of UTMTM was eluted in 50 µL, and then purified
samples were evaluated by GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and reference real-time RT-PCR.

of the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE® FLU A/B compared with reference
real-time RT-PCR were calculated using the Clopper and Pearson methods with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). All calculations were conducted using the R 3.3.1 software program
(The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

3 Results
3.1 Analytical sensitivity of the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2
The results of the LOD evaluation are summarized in Table 1. The reference RT-PCR
correctly detected up to 5 copies/test, while GENECUBE® with the automated extraction
method detected up to 6 copies/test determined by the reference RT-PCR. The LOD of
GENECUBE® with the heat extraction method was 17 copies/test determined by the reference
RT-PCR.

3.2 A comparison of the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 with reference RT-PCR
During the study period, we evaluated 1065 nasopharyngeal samples. Of these 1065
samples, 486 (45.6%) were obtained from symptomatic patients, and 579 (54.4%) were
obtained from asymptomatic patients.
The comparison of the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 assay with the reference RTPCR for purified samples is summarized in Table 2a. The total, positive and negative
concordance of the two assays were 99.7% (1062/1065), 100% (81/81), and 99.7% (981/984),
respectively. Of the three samples with discordance between the two assays, all samples were
negative by the reference RT-PCR assay and positive by the GENECUBE® assay. SARS-CoV2 was detected from all three samples by the GeneXpert® for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 3).
The comparison of the GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 assay with the heat extraction
method with the reference RT-PCR is summarized in Table 2b. The total, positive and negative

concordance of the two assays were 99.7% (1062/1065), 97.5% (79/81), and 99.9% (983/984),
respectively. Of the three samples with discordance between the two assays, one sample was
negative by the reference RT-PCR assay and positive by the GENECUBE® assay with the heat
extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 was detected from the sample by the GeneXpert®for SARSCoV-2. The other two samples were positive by the reference RT-PCR assay and negative by
the GENECUBE® assay with the heat extraction method (Table 3).

3.3 Evaluation of the GENECUBE®HQ SARS-CoV-2 for pooled samples
The results of the pooling testing with the GENECUBE ® HQ SARS-CoV-2 were
summarized in Supplementary Table 2a. The GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 showed a
positive result for every pooled sample with a low viral load (20/20, 100%) and with a
moderate-high viral load (20/20, 100%). Meanwhile, the reference RT-PCR assay was negative
in 4 low viral load pooled samples.

3.4 The comparison of the GENECUBE® FLU A/B with reference RT-PCR
The comparison of the GENECUBE® FLU A/B assay with the reference RT-PCR is
summarized in Table 4a. A total of 81 preserved positive UTMTM samples (A: 48 samples, B:
33 samples) were used for the evaluation. Among these 81 positive samples, the sensitivity of
antigen testing was 65.4% (53/81).
For purified samples, the total, positive and negative concordance of the 2 assays were
99.5% (191/192), 100% (80/80) and 99.1% (112/113), respectively. One sample with
discordance between the two assays was negative by the reference RT-PCR assay and positive
by the GENECUBE® FLU A/B assay. The influenza virus was not detected from the sample
by FilmArray®. (Table 5).

with the reference RT-PCR is summarized in Table 4b. The total, positive and negative
concordance of the 2 assays were 97.4% (187/192), 93.8% (75/80) and 100% (113/113),
respectively. Of the five samples with discordance between the two assays, all samples were
positive by the reference RT-PCR assay and negative by the GENECUBE® FLU A/B assay
with heat-extraction method (Table 5).

4 Discussion
In this study, GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE® FLU A/B showed
high analytical performance in this study. The total concordance rate in clinical samples was
over 99% between the 2 tests. Regarding the GENECUBE ® FLU A/B, the total concordance
rate with the reference RT-PCR was 99.5%. The GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 provided
comparable LODs with the reference RT-PCR and successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in all
positive pooled samples.
The N2 assay of NIID was reported to have a high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting
SARS-CoV2 [18]. For the evaluations using purified samples, three discordant cases existed
between GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the reference real-time RT-PCR. Most molecular
examinations accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 [21], although some discordance among different
systems has been reported [18,22,23]. All our discordant cases tested positive for both
GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GeneXpert®; therefore, it appears that these samples
indeed contained SARS-CoV-2. When evaluating the pooled samples with a low viral load, we
also recognized a similar discordance, GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 positive/the reference
PCR negative. The sensitivity of molecular examinations may differ between experimental and
clinical samples [24]. In this study, we observed the insufficient amplification of the target by
the reference real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Figure 1) and recognized the inhibition which
was not indicated in the LODs experiment with diluted UTM TM samples. Multiple factors can

influence the results of NAATs, including the quality of the extracted RNA, the presence of
RT-PCR inhibitors, genomic mutations [23] and stochasticity observed in very low viral
concentrations [17]. These factors may have contributed to the discrepancy in our samples.
Although the extraction methods may influence the RNA recovery [19,20], both
rapidity and accuracy are essential for SARS-CoV-2 testing. The heat extraction method can
be performed within about 10 minutes, which thus enables the GENECUBE® system to obtain
results in less than 40 minutes after the samples arrive at the microbiology laboratory. In this
study, GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 showed an increase in its LOD when the heat
extraction method was used. However, GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 with heat extraction
showed acceptable analytical performance in clinical specimens, providing a 99.7%
concordance rate with the reference real-time RT-PCR.
In the coming winter season, the co-detection of influenza virus will become important
for patient management and infection control [25]. The GENECUBE® FLU A/B assay
demonstrated only one discordant case with the reference RT-PCR, indicating high analytical
performance. The inconsistent case was positive on GENECUBE® FLU A/B but negative on
reference RT-PCR and the subsequent Filmarray® assay. This case may be a false positive;
however, in our previous study using fresh samples [13], the cobas Liat Influenza A/B assay
(Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA, USA) provided a positive result for influenza B
virus for the discordant sample. Further data are required to evaluate the possibility of falsepositive results associated with the GENECUBE® FLU A/B. Similar to GENECUBE® HQ
SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of GENECUBE® FLU A/B was slightly reduced when using the
heat extraction method. Still, the sensitivity of GENECUBE® FLU A/B with heat extraction
was comparable to that of other NAATs and far better than that of antigen tests [26].
Several limitations associated with the present study should be mentioned. First, we did
not evaluate anterior nasal or saliva samples. Sample collection from the anterior nasal cavity

or saliva is less invasive than that from the nasopharynx [27,28], and several molecular
examinations can adequately detect SARS-CoV-2 in these samples [28,29]. Further research is
warranted to evaluate the performance of GENECUBE ® HQ SARS-CoV-2 using samples
collected from body sites other than the nasopharynx. Second, the analytical performance may
be affected by the future emergence of mutations SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus which
are involved in the target areas of GENECUBE ® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and GENECUBE® FLU
A/B. Finally, the data for GENECUBE® FLU A/B were limited due to the low prevalence of
the influenza virus, especially for fresh samples.
In conclusion, GENECUBE® HQ SARS-CoV-2 and the GENECUBE® FLU A/B
provided high analytical performance and the ability to evaluate multiple samples in a short
period of time.
