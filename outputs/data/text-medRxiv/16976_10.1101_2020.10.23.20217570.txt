Summary

29

Background

30

When a new pathogen emerges, consistent case reporting is critical for public health surveillance.

31

Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease

32

and how to effectively design interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we

33

describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and

34

highlight the impact of specific reporting methods.

35
36

Methods

37

We reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive

38

dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the

39

epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems. We

40

further described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and

41

timepoints, and the accessibility of epidemiological data.

42
43

Findings

44

Our findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed

45

epidemiological data during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, changes in reporting

46

were frequent and varied across data and countries. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for

47

demographic data such as age and sex, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were

48

frequent. We also found that most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using

49

HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses.

51

Interpretation

52

Countries have different reporting systems and different capacities for maintaining consistent reporting

53

of epidemiological data. As the pandemic progresses, governments may also change their priorities in

54

data sharing. Our study thus highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of epidemiological

55

data of COVID-19 within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. Further, most

56

countries provide data on a daily basis but not always in a readily usable format. As governments

57

continue to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to

58

be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and the implementation and evaluation of

59

interventions.

73

Research in context

74

Ongoing research into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 depends entirely on access to regularly

75

updated, factor-rich data. The benefits and importance of data-sharing practices have been well-

76

documented during previous outbreaks, however the scale of the global pandemic currently faced

77

presents its own unique challenges. The majority of countries are routinely reporting the number of

78

confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19, with the country-wide cumulative totals readily

79

accessible from databases such as the one curated by Johns Hopkins University.9 However, the breadth

80

of further information reported by each country is less understood. Access to demographic and

81

geographic information of cases in particular is critically important in the context of informing response

82

policy, as these provide greater insights into how subgroups of the population in different areas are

83

affected by the disease. Understanding how and when these data is provided is critical to ensuring that

84

modelling efforts and government response are well-informed.

85
86

Evidence before this study

87

The current research into the quality of data reporting is severely limited, with studies focussing

88

primarily around specific locations, time periods, or population sub-groups. One research group has

89

examined the data availability for 507 patients reported in January, finding that the majority of

90

information was provided by social media and news outlets. Other than this example, there is no other

91

work that we are aware of that investigates the issues surrounding data availability. Our work is the first

92

to explore the scale of data reporting across the broader pandemic timeline.

93
94

Added value of this study

95

Our research provides wider insight into the data pipeline from government to researchers, and how it

96

has adapted over time. This timeline provides greater context to the specific findings of subsequent

97

data-driven research, highlighting areas and time periods where particular data feeds are likely to be

98

particularly biased or data-sparse. We are also able to recommend, based upon our findings, prioritising

99

the use of the early-case histories of specific countries for the calculation of demographic-specific

100

disease parameters. By highlighting particular regions where specific data are available, such as travel

101

history, hospitalisation times and symptom-tracking, we are also able to identify ideal further topics of

102

research in the ongoing attempts to fight the spread of COVID-19.

103
104

Implications of all the available evidence

105

We reviewed the data of the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group’s centralised repository and other

106

relevant data sources to compare the reporting systems of 11 Southeast Asian countries. We found that

107

governments frequently changed the type of data and level of detail reported as the pandemic

108

progressed. Our study thus highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of epidemiological

109

COVID-19 data within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. Further, most

110

countries provide data on a daily basis but not always in a readily usable format. As governments

111

continue to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to

112

be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and the implementation and evaluation of

113

interventions.

Introduction

121

In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was

122

reported in Wuhan, China and was determined to cause the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-

123

19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of

124

International Concern on 30 January 2020, and subsequently a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

125
126

To effectively respond to public health emergencies, there is a need for timely and accurate reporting

127

of statistics and data sharing as highlighted in the recent Ebola and Zika epidemics. 1-4 To this end, the

128

Principles for Data Sharing in Public Health Emergencies consisting of timeliness, ethics, equitability,

129

accessibility, transparency, fairness, and quality have been developed and introduced. 3,5,6 As of writing,

130

only one study on data sharing during disease outbreaks among Southeast Asian countries has been

131

carried out.7 The study evaluated data quality and timeliness of outbreak reporting in Cambodia, Lao

132

PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam for dengue, food poisoning and diarrhea, severe diarrhea, diphtheria,

133

measles, H5N1 influenza, H1N1 influenza, rabies, and pertussis. Further, it highlighted the broad

134

differences observed in the data quality and timeliness between participating countries, concluding that

135

any international data-curating attempts must be versatile enough to accomodate this.

136
137

In the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, government organisations, public health agencies, and research groups

138

are responding to the call for rapid data sharing by providing data and curating detailed real-time

139

databases that are readily and publicly accessible.8–11 Data from various groups have informed more

140

than 100,000 papers on COVID-19.12 Despite progress in reporting and sharing data, several challenges

141

remain. First, there are ethical and privacy considerations that need to be balanced carefully against the

142

potential impact of open data sharing. Second, there is a clear lack of capacity and often appropriate

143

computational infrastructure that may make data sharing in real time unfeasible and burdensome. 3,4

144

Such challenges may result in changes in the quality and detail of data reporting between and within

145

countries over time as their respective health systems become increasingly overwhelmed. 11 These shifts

146

in reporting provide a challenge for accurately comparing epidemiological situations between countries.

147

In China, for example, it has been shown that changes in reporting have impacted modelling results of

148

the transmission parameters of COVID-19.13 Further, as the pandemic progresses and epidemiological

149

information becomes increasingly less available, analyses of detailed case counts that cover the entire

150

duration of the epidemic may not be feasible.10

151
152

To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe the ways in which various countries in a geographic

153

region report COVID-19 data, and how the detail of data reporting changed over time. We reviewed

154

detailed epidemiological data from Southeast Asian countries and tracked how countries’ reporting of

155

COVID-19 data has shifted. We further evaluated differences in reporting between countries and

156

described the accessibility of epidemiological data during the first wave in 2020. This study is

157

descriptive and does not seek to evaluate health systems reporting. However, by providing these types

158

of information, researchers may be able to conduct better and more nuanced analyses of epidemiological

159

data of COVID-19. By showing changes in reporting, we hope to provide insights on how data should

160

be viewed and analysed.

161

162

Methods

163

Study design

164

We conducted an observational study to describe and track changes in reporting of epidemiological data

165

during the COVID-19 pandemic in 11 countries in Southeast Asia, namely Brunei, Cambodia,

166

Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and

167

Vietnam. Such a design allows us to compare the data reporting practices between different countries

168

through time as the pandemic progresses.14

169

Data sources and compilation

170

We focused on reporting mechanisms of individual level COVID-19 data from the aforementioned 11

171

countries in Southeast Asia. The region is characterized by archipelagos and comprises more than 8·0%

172

of the world’s population. During the first wave of the pandemic, these 11 countries contributed about

173

1·3% of the cases to the global count of more than 2·3 million cases on April 20.

174
175

The Open COVID-19 Data Curation Group’s centralised repository of individual-level information on

176

patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 collected data on the following variables deemed

177

essential in monitoring pandemics: (a) Key dates, which include the date of travel, date of onset of

178

symptoms, date of confirmation of infection, date of admission to hospital, and date of outcome; (b)

179

Demographic information inclduing the age, sex, and occupation of cases; (c) Geographic information

180

on domicile and travel history at the highest resolution available down to the district level; (d) Any

181

additional information such as symptoms and ‘contact tracing data’ (i.e., a record of exposure to infected

182

individuals).10 Information about the occupation of confirmed cases was also included where available.

183

The collection of data on these variables mirrors the minimum data to be collected for a line list of

184

pandemic influenza cases obtained from surveillance systems, as suggested by the WHO.15 Other

185

sources, such as the interactive dashboard by Johns Hopkins University, 9 do not provide detailed

186

individual-level information and hence were not used in this study.

187
188

We reviewed the data of the Open COVID-19 Data Working Group’s centralised repository and other

189

relevant data sources. These were primarily websites of the various governments and ministries of

190

health in Southeast Asia, including but not limited to their COVID-19 trackers, dashboards and case

191

bulletins. In addition, we reviewed data from news agencies, pre-prints and peer-reviewed research

192

articles that contained information on COVID-19 cases in the country. We reviewed all possible

193

publicly available data sources from the date when the first confirmed case was reported in the country,

194

and up to April 20. We documented how key information was reported and how it changed through

195

time.

196
197

Shifts in reporting of epidemiological data during the first wave

198

We documented trends and changes in how key epidemiological variables were reported by 11

199

Southeast Asian countries throughout the study period from January 23 to April 20. Time periods were

200

defined by specific milestones in each country’s data reporting. The first time period or ‘first reporting

201

of cases’ for all countries was the date at which the country reported its first COVID-19 case.

202

Meanwhile, the ‘first change in reporting’ was the time when the information format was changed from

203

the first report based on available data during the study period. Any further changes in the level of

204

detail, also referred in this paper as granularity for geographic data and precision for both demographic

205

and temporal data, in the reporting of any of the epidemiological variables were considered as a ‘change

206

in reporting’ and were noted as a subsequent time period (Table 1). The ‘last observed change in

207

reporting’ was the last documented change up to April 20. We also noted the number of cases in each

208

timepoint. In this paper, we only present results on the ‘first reporting of cases’ (T0), ‘first observed

209

change in reporting’ (T1), and ‘last observed change in reporting’ (T2).

210
211

Differences in the granularity and precision of reporting across countries

212

We explored the differences in reporting of demographic, geographic, and temporal data across

213

countries at three key timepoints: at the time they first reported cases (T0), at the time when the reporting

214

first changed (T1), and at the last observed change in reporting (T2). Any change in the level of

215

granularity or precision in reporting is noted. We present these differences for each epidemiological

216

variable classified into: (a) demographic data; (b) geographic data; and (c) temporal data. Data for other

217

epidemiological variables are presented in the Supplementary Appendix.

218

Accessibility of COVID-19 data in the region

219

We described the accessibility of COVID-19 data in the region by documenting and providing a list of

220

sources for each country in different formats, including: government trackers and dashboards that report

221

close to real-time data, downloadable PDF reports on cases, downloadable CSV files for cases, and

222

Github repository for cases. In addition, we noted the frequency of data updates by government and

223

public health agencies in the country.

Results

231

Shifts in reporting of epidemiological data during the first wave

232

The first Southeast Asian country to report a COVID-19 case was Thailand on January 23. Singapore,

233

Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines subsequently reported cases on or before the WHO

234

declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30.

235

Indonesia, Brunei, Timor-Leste, Myanmar and Lao PDR reported their first cases of COVID-19 in

236

March (Figure 1).

237
238

Malaysia had the shortest time between reporting of the first case and first change in reporting of

239

epidemiological data. Only a day after their first reported case, more detailed reports on the occurrence

240

of symptoms, and dates of symptom onset and hospitalisation were provided. Similar improvements in

10

241

terms of the level of granularity and precision in reporting data were also noted for the following

242

countries: Philippines eventually reported comorbidities for some patients, Singapore and Vietnam

243

eventually reported data on occupation, and Timor-Leste eventually reported travel history data. As

244

case numbers increased, several countries provided less detailed information. By March 15, when 96

245

cases had been identified, Indonesia ceased reporting individual-level data and switched to aggregate

246

data (i.e., number of cases per day). Timor-Leste followed by April 15, when it had 8 recorded cases.

247

The first and the last changes in reporting were the same for Indonesia and Brunei, while Myanmar was

248

the only country that consistently reported individual-level COVID-19 epidemiologic data since

249

reporting its first two cases on March 23 until April 20.

250
251

Differences in the granularity and precision of reporting across countries

252

There were minimal changes in the reporting of demographic data among countries. The majority of

253

countries reported age and sex except for Timor-Leste, and only Indonesia shifted from a more precise

254

reporting of age and sex to less detailed reporting (Figures 2a and 2b). We observed more changes in

255

the reporting of occupation (Figure 2c); Indonesia only provided occupation data at the time of reporting

256

of first cases, while Singapore and Vietnam included data on occupation of COVID-19 patients at later

257

timepoints.

258
259

Location information on domicile and travel history differed across countries and timepoints. While all

260

11 countries provided domicile information (Figure 3a), only Singapore provided precise-level

261

addresses. Both Indonesia and Malaysia initially provided city-level information and shifted to less

262

granular reporting. For Indonesia, province-level data was being reported by March 15 when it reached

263

96 cases. Meanwhile, Malaysia started reporting province-level data on March 21 when it reached 1183

264

confirmed cases. On the other hand, the information coming from some countries initially presented

265

less granularity or lower geographic resolution: Lao PDR initially reported country-level information,

266

Thailand initially reported province-level addresses and Vietnam initially reported city-level addresses;

267

eventually all three countries reported precise address data. There were less differences observed for

268

travel location data reporting across countries, but also more shifts observed across time (Figure 3b).

269

Most (8 of 11) provided city-level information of the travel history; only Myanmar provided country-

270

level information, while both Indonesia and Timor-Leste provided no information at the time of

271

reporting their first cases. Only Timor-Leste shifted to a more precise level of reporting over time, while

272

Brunei, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand reported less granular data. Lao PDR

273

shifted reporting travel histories from city-level information when it reported its first two cases to no

274

information being shared when it had six confirmed cases, and then to country-level travel history data

275

when it had reported 11 cases.

276
277

For all temporal variables, countries reported either precise dates or no dates at all. At the start of each

278

country’s first case, the majority of countries provided travel history dates except for Brunei, Indonesia,

279

and Timor-Leste (Figure 4a). Only Brunei shifted to reporting dates for the succeeding timepoints while

280

Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore stopped reporting dates as cases increased. Lao PDR repeatedly

281

shifted between reporting travel dates and excluding this information. The precision of reporting

282

symptom onset dates also varied across countries and timepoints (Figure 4b). Cambodia, Indonesia and

283

Timor-Leste never reported such information, while Brunei and Vietnam consistently reported specific

284

dates when symptoms presented. Malaysia provided day information in the succeeding timepoints while

285

Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand eventually stopped reporting the date of symptom

286

onset. Lao PDR repeatedly shifted between reporting of dates to no reporting. Both date of confirmation

287

and date of outcome showed consistent reporting in all countries except Thailand, which stopped

288

reporting the date of confirmation when it reported 42 cases (Figure 4c). Most countries reported the

289

date of admission except for Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Timor-Leste (Figure 4d).

290

Only Thailand had a shift in reporting dates of discharge, recovery, or death - reporting this information

291

only in late February when it had 42 cases (Figure 4e). Malaysia provided this information in the

292

succeeding timepoints while Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand eventually stopped reporting the date

293

of symptom onset. Lao PDR repeatedly shifted between reporting of dates to providing no such

294

information.

295
296

Accessibility of COVID-19 data in the region

297

Most of the governments in Southeast Asia instituted infrastructures and guidelines for the

298

dissemination of COVID-19 data, and provided free access to the public. Brunei’s COVID-19 data are

299

publicly available but the individual requesting the information needs to provide passport information

300

and contact number to gain access to the database. During the study period, all countries had

301

government trackers and dashboards except for Timor-Leste (Table 2). Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia,

302

Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam provide daily updates on their COVID-19 data. For the

303

remaining five countries, the frequency of updating is unclear/irregular. Brunei, Philippines, and

304

Singapore use PDFs to disseminate select patient-level data, and only Thailand provides downloadable

305

individual-level CSV files.

306
307

Discussion

308

Responding to calls for data sharing and transparency, most governments in Southeast Asia established

309

publicly available sources of COVID-19 individual-level information. This commitment to data sharing

310

and reporting allowed the comparison of the different data reporting practices of the countries in the

311

region. We found that countries in Southeast Asia have different reporting practices since the start of

312

the pandemic and during the first months of its progression. Overall, reporting of epidemiological data

313

in Southeast Asia is precise and detailed. Many variables were consistently maintained throughout the

314

initial outbreak period, but those with changes in reporting started early with case counts as low as four

315

to as high as 136. There was little to no change in reporting of demographic data while changes in

316

reporting of geographic and temporal variables were frequent and unpredictable as the pandemic

317

progressed. Further, we find that changes in the level of precision in reporting does not only depend on

318

case numbers, but also on the policies and interventions implemented. Comparisons across countries

319

for different epidemiologic variables showed that national governments may shift to a less or more

320

precise reporting of data as dictated by the burden of COVID-19 in the communities and/or their

321

national response. As an example, Indonesia started reporting aggregate data less than two weeks after

322

their first case was reported. Their government did not implement a nationwide lockdown, but rather

323

focused on scaling up capacity, treatment of patients and supporting economic recovery. Conversely,

324

Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam reported more precise demographic and geographic data at the end of

325

the study period compared to how they reported their first cases. The national governments of these

326

countries established mechanisms to quickly identify and isolate cases and their contacts requiring

327

detailed contact tracing data. Our findings also show that most countries reported more precise

328

information towards the end of the study period, but some variables such as travel history location were

329

reported with less detail compared to the increased precision for domicile data. These trends in travel

330

history data highlight the shift in priorities of the governments in the region towards managing local

331

transmission. Southeast Asian countries implemented travel restrictions early, therefore having fewer

332

imported cases and less need for precise travel history data.33

333
334

Data on dates of symptom onset, confirmation, admission, and death or discharge are important in

335

estimating disease burden and forecasting health service needs. Dates of confirmation and death or

336

discharge were reported consistently by most countries. This reflects the effective system of

337

governments to register all confirmed patients in their database upon entry and exit in the healthcare

338

system. However, we found that dates of symptom onset and hospital admission were no longer reported

339

at the end of the observation period. The reporting of less precise dates could be attributed to the

340

increasing incidence of COVID-19, which could have overwhelmed data reporting mechanisms of the

341

countries, particularly because individual patient follow-up requires symptom onset dates to be

342

accurately logged. Governments thus need to establish systems that allow accurate and fast reporting of

343

detailed temporal data. Lack of precision could adversely affect the quality of mathematical models and

344

other analyses, which are used to forecast demand for health services and make decisions. This

345

consequently impacts the responses to COVID-19 at a national and subnational level, which is of greater

346

concern among low- and middle-countries (LMICs) that have already fragile health systems. Our

347

findings provide insights on how different health systems respond to the pandemic. Consequently, these

348

could be used to guide how publicly available data is analysed, used, and interpreted.

349
350

Most countries reported COVID-19 data daily, with unclear reporting frequencies only being observed

351

for Brunei, Lao PDR, and Timor-Leste. These countries do not report new cases every day because of

352

the low number of new daily cases leading to days where no additional cases are confirmed. As they

353

only provide updates on days when new COVID-19 cases are confirmed, their frequency of providing

354

data updates on COVID-19 is thus irregular. Countries primarily reported individual-level data in either

355

HTML and PDF formats, which necessitates scraping and extraction before such data could be used in

356

analyses. During the study period, only Thailand provided a downloadable CSV format of their data.

357

Ready-to-use data formats are important as these allow the public and scientific community to rapidly

358

view and analyse country-specific information.

359
360

An important limitation of this study is the absence of an assessment on data quality. This evaluation

361

was not carried out because of the fast progression of the pandemic with corresponding rapid changes

362

in data reporting. The lack of an up-to-date and complete line list also prevents a thorough assessment

363

of data quality. Lastly and most importantly, an evaluation of data quality also requires the consideration

364

of other indicators such as flexibility, representativeness, data security and system stability to provide

365

a more accurate picture of health systems and disease surveillance systems.7 These information are not

366

readily available and require more resources to be collected. Despite such caveats, however, this study

367

is the first to systematically describe and compare reporting of important epidemiological data for

368

COVID-19 across countries during the first wave. Our findings will allow researchers to conduct more

369

nuanced analyses using epidemiological data of COVID-19.

370
371

In conclusion, reporting systems in the region have been quickly established and countries provided

372

detailed individual-level data during the first wave. This pandemic highlights the critical role of timely,

373

accurate, and precise data sharing during outbreaks of global scale. Some concerns regarding data

374

sharing remain, such as data privacy and public criticisms.3,4 Given that sharing of data is needed for

375

evidence-informed policies and interventions, maintaining and strengthening data reporting systems

376

should still be a priority of countries.34-36 For the purposes of surveillance on emerging infectious

377

diseases, we recommend that governments coordinate data collection and reporting so that data are as

378

comparable as possible between countries. Countries may also benefit from reporting data in a fully

379

open access format that is readily available and in machine-readable formats to accommodate new

380

epidemics and context-specific information. Hopefully, more governments will come to share precise

381

data to allow more nuanced analyses. This will provide an opportunity to better understand the disease

382

and how best to respond to the pandemic.
