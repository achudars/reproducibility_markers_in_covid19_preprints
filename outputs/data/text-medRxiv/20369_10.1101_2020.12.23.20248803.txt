Meaning: A clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 avoids missed diagnosis due to
insufficient sensitivity or incorrect timing of the performance of rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2,
reduces costs, avoid delays on specific managements, and allows the testing of
potentially effective antiviral therapeutic approaches that should work if administered in
the early stage of COVID-19

Abstract

Importance: In the COVID-19 pandemic, a limiting barrier for more successful
approaches to COVID-19 is the lack of appropriate timing for its diagnosis, during the
viral replication stage, when antiviral approaches could demonstrate efficacy,
precluding progression to severe stages. Three major reasons that hamper the diagnosis
earlier in the disease are the unspecific and mild symptoms in the first stage, the costand time-limitations of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and the insufficient sensitivity of this
test as desired for screening purposes during the pandemic. More sensitive and earlier
methods of COVID-19 detection should be considered as key for breakthrough changes
in the disease course and response to specific therapeutic strategies. Our objective was
to propose a clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (The AndroCoV Clinical
Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis) that has been validated in a large population sample,
aiming to encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical likelihood of
presenting COVID-19, at least during the pandemics, independent of a rtPCR-SARSCOV-2 test.

Materials and methods: This is a compounded retrospective and prospective analysis
of clinical data prospectively collected from the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials
that resulted in a clinical scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis based on likelihood of
presenting COVID-19 according to the number of symptoms, presence of anosmia, and
known positive household contact, in a variety of combinations of scoring criteria,
aiming to the detect scorings that provided the highest pre-test probability and accuracy.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive
likelihood ratio, and accuracy were calculated for subjects screened in two different
periods and altogether, for females, males, and both, in a total of nine different
scenarios, for combinations between one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence
of anosmia in subjects without known positive household contacts, and no symptoms,
one, two, or three or more symptoms, or presence of anosmia or ageusia in subjects with
known positive household contacts.
Results: 1,757 patients were screened for COVID-19. Among the multiple
combinations, requiring two or more symptoms with or without anosmia or ageusia for
subjects without known contact and one or more symptoms with or without anosmia or
ageusia with known positive contacts presented the highest accuracy (80.4%), and
higher pretest probability and accuracy than virtually all rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2
commercially available kit tests.
Conclusion: The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 Diagnosis was
demonstrated to be a feasible, quick, inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool for
clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. A clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should avoid delays
and missed diagnosis, and reduce costs, and should therefore be recommended as a firstline option for COVID-19 diagnosis for public health policies, at least while SARSCoV-2 is the prevailing circulating virus.

Introduction

While COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide,
its early stage remains poorly characterized (1). The inability to better understand the
COVID-19 pathophysiology, clinical and biochemical presentation in the first days after
contamination may be explained by a variety of challenging reasons. First, because
symptoms in the first stage of COVID-19 are essentially unspecific, since it can
resemble upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), dengue fever, and/or gastrointestinal
(GI) infections (2), precluding subjects to be suspected for COVID-19 before the
progression to more severe states, unless if they had known contact with a confirmed
COVID-19 case. Second, because research on COVID-19 has mainly focused on
approaches to reduce mortality in already severely affected COVID-19 subjects (1).
Third, because even after the extensively described pathophysiology of second stage of
COVID-19 as being basically mediated by overreactive, dysfunctional inflammatory
responses (1), while virological activity becomes minor and not as relevant for the
current clinical status, antiviral pharmacological approaches have been persistently and
solely tested for this stage, when efficacy would not expect to be found. Without
apparently effective approaches to early COVID-19, this stage has progressively been
deprioritized in basic and clinical research.
A fourth reason that reinforces the unsuccessfulness of approaching early
COVID-19 is that while COVID-19 is that while many are under-suspected due to lack
of typical clinical characteristics, whenever COVID-19 is suspected, the need of a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248803; this version posted January 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this

positive real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 for the
conclusive diagnosis of COVID-19, which remains as the gold standard diagnostic test
for COVID-19, delays the time-to-diagnosis and time-to-treat. In addition, the
sensitivity of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 19 has demonstrated wide variability between kit
tests (3-5), and may lead to an overwhelming number of false negative tests (6-12),
which is particularly relevant for higher risk patients, allowing progression to severe
states due to the inability to detect COVID-19 in earlier stages. Both increased time-todiagnosis and false negative tests preclude patients from the correct timing of specific
antiviral approaches for COVID-19, and may also have contributed to the lack of
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted during actual early COVID-19.
Hence, more sensitive and earlier detection of COVID-19 could be the key for a
breakthrough change in the disease course and response to specific therapeutic
strategies, since the majority of new molecules and drug repurposing focused on their
potential antiviral activity, which would find the most effective results earliest in the
disease.
Considering that: 1. Clinical or radiological criteria for other viral infections is
the gold standard or a sufficient method for the diagnosis; 2. The need of a positive
rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is a barrier in terms of cost and
diagnostic delays; 3. Infections caused by other agents are unlikely to occur during the
pandemic, when SARS-CoV-2 is the prevailing virus circulating and other infections
are effectively prevented by the spread use of masks; 4. Since SARS-CoV-2 is the
prevailing virus during the pandemics, a range of different and unspecific symptoms are
more likely to be caused by this virus; and 5. For screening purposes, more sensitive
tools than rtPCT-SARS-CoV-2 are highly recommended, our objective was to propose a
clinical scoring for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has been validated in a large

population sample to encourage the management of patients with high pre-clinical
likelihood of presenting COVID-19, at least during the pandemics, independently of the
rtPCR-SARS-COV-2 result.

Materials and methods

This is a retrospective analysis followed by a prospective analysis of clinical
data that was prospectively collected from the Pre-AndroCoV and AndroCov Trials (1316), as well as patients that followed up without participating or receiving any treatment
regimen for COVID-19 aimed to calculate their likelihood to present COVID-19
according to the number of symptoms and contact with a known positive household.
Subjects presenting at least one of the following symptoms, that were actively
searched, whether they had contact with confirmed case for COVID-19 or not, were
screened for COVID-19 through a rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and included in the present
analysis: 1 Specific COVID-19 manifestations: hyposmia, anosmia, dysgeusia or
ageusia; 2. Symptoms typically present in dengue fever (dengue fever-like syndrome):
myalgia, arthralgia, upper back pain, conjunctival hyperemia, pre-orbital pain; 3.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (URTI-like syndrome): nasal
congestion, rhinorrhea, dry cough, self-reported perception of “sinusitis”, or selfreported perception of “sore throat”; 4. Symptoms of acute gastroenteritis (GE) (GElike syndrome): nauseas, vomiting, or abdominal pain 5. Additional unspecific
presentation, including lower back pain, leg pain, feverish, fatigue, weakness, dizziness
and headache. For pre-existing symptoms or those that are frequently experimented,

changes in the patterns of these symptoms were required in order to be counted as a
symptom.
After the evaluation of the first 1,557 patients, 200 were presumedly diagnosed
for COVID-19 based on the resulting clinical scoring when pre-test probability was
higher than rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity, and prospectively evaluated. All 200
patients underwent a first rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and those with negative results
underwent a second rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, between 24 and 72 hours later the first one.
Combination of scenarios for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were tested for
precision-related statistical parameters: when one, two, three or more symptoms, or
when anosmia or ageusia were presented, and whether there was or there was not
known positive households. Scenarios were tested for three moments, including two
distinct periods and these two periods together. The first period comprised the
observational study of the AndroCoV Trial (pre-AndroCoV Trial), between May 2020
and July 2020, and the second period, that comprised the AndroCoV RCTs and the
follow-up of untreated patients that did not participate in any of the RCTs, between July
2020 to December 2020. Each scenario in each moment was analyzed for males,
females, and overall.

Statistical analysis
Sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability, positive and negative predictive value
were calculated. For the calculations, purely screening, i.e., subjects without symptoms
and without known positive households were not considered, since there is no
justification to search for COVID-19 in this population.

Results

In total, 1,757 patients were screened for COVID-19, including 1,557 and 200
patients for the retrospective and prospective analysis, respectively, and 1041 males and
716 females. In the first period, 755 patients were screened, including 413 males and
342 females. In second period, 1002 patients were screened, including 628 males and
374 females. No non-binary or non-cissexual subjects were screened.
Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 included 585 from the observational study,
94 patients from the spironolactone arm of the AndroCoV Trial (SPIRO AndroCoVTrial), 138 patients from the dutasteride arm of the AndroCoV Trial (DUTA
AndroCoV-Trial), 169 patients from the proxalutamide arm of the AndroCoV Trial
(PROXA AndroCoV-Trial), and 198 patients followed apart from any of the Trials.
The positivity rates of the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 tests according to the number of
symptoms, presence of anosmia or ageusia, and contact with a positive household for
males, females, and both, in the first and second period, and altogether, are displayed in
Figure 1. Positivity rates were above 60% when at least two symptoms were present,
irrespective of household contact, above 80% when at least one symptom was present
with known positive household contact or three or more symptoms were present without
known contact, and above 95% when anosmia was present, irrespective of previous
known contact with positive households, or three or more symptoms with known
positive household. All patients with anosmia or ageusia and known positive household
were positive for COVID-19.

Figure 2 presents the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV values to detect
COVID-19 using clinical scorings in different combinations, according to the number of
symptoms required or presence of anosmia when with and without known positive
households. Figure 3 illustrates the tables with the number of subjects encompassed in
each combination, as well as the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives
and false negatives, and sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and positive
likelihood ratio. The combinations with sensitivity above 80% and accuracy above 70%,
i.e., a pretest probability higher than the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, include when it is

when three or more symptoms, among the ones listed, or anosmia or ageusia are
present, irrespective of known positive contact, or when at least one symptom, anosmia
or ageusia is present after contact with a positive household, COVID-19 can be
diagnosed clinically and managed accordingly. In case two symptoms are present
without known contact, rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 should be performed, but high-risk
patients should start specific therapeutics without further delays, as COVID-19 is likely
present in this scenario. In case one symptom is present without contact with positive
household, or when subject is asymptomatic with a positive household contact, rtPCRSARS-CoV-2 should only be performed in high-risk patients.

Prospective follow-up

From the diagnostic management proposed in Figure 4, 200 patients were
screened using the AndroCoV0derived Diagnostic Management flowchart and followed
prospectively, including 169 from the PROXA Andro-CoV Trial and 29 that followed
up apart from the RCTs.
Of these, 169 (84.5%) were virologically diagnosed in the first rtPCR-SARSCoV-2, 29 (11.5%) were diagnosed in the second rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and two (1%)
remained negative. Using two consecutive rtPCRs, the accuracy of the proposed clinical
scoring combinations was 99% (Figure 5).

pre-test probability is higher than the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity, and may lead to
misdiagnosis, rather than clarification, if performed.
When between 4 and 5 points, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is likely, a rtPCRSARS-CoV-2 is required, and if negative, a second, consecutive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2
should be performed three days after the first test, since the sensitivity of rtPCR-SARSCoV-2 tends to be lower in the beginning of the disease. Exceptionally, for high-risk
patients, specific approaches or treatments for COVID-19 should not be delayed until a
positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, and should be continued independently of rtPCR-SARSCoV-2. Three points or below represents a scenario of possible but not likely COVID19, and rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 is only recommended for high risk subjects.
The number of points necessary to allow the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19
was based on the likelihood of having COVID-19 when compared to the sensitivity of
rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2. When the pre-test probability was higher than 80% and also
higher than the rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity, a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19
could be determined.
The presence of anosmia or ageusia is highly specific to COVID-19 that occurs
later in the first stage of the disease, and has alone a specificity of 98.8% for the
COVID-19 diagnosis, irrespective of positive household contact, and should provide a
more accurate COVID-19 diagnosis per se than rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2. For this reason,
any of these two symptoms provide 06 points in the scoring, sufficient for the clinical
diagnosis of COVID-19. Hyposmia and dysgeusia are highly specific as well, but may
suffer interferences of other URTIs, and provide therefore 05 points. Only those with
anosmia or hyposmia prior to COVID-19 should be excluded for this evaluation.
Contact with a household confirmed for COVID-19 raises the risk of COVID-19
to 50% to 60% if the positive contact was a female and 20% to 30% if the positive

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248803; this version posted January 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this

contact was a male, as per our analysis of the same set of subjects (2;13-15). Although
the risk of transmission is approximately the double when the positive contact is a
female, contact with positive female and male should not count as 04 and 02 points,
respectively, because females tend to have fewer symptoms and demonstrated for
specificity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 when presenting one or two symptoms.
Hence, the relative importance of a positive contact is higher for females than males,
which counterbalance with lower risk to be infected from a positive male, and allows
that 04 points for a positive household remains precise for both male and female
contact. Accordingly, even though contact with confirmed household would be more
precisely counted as 04 points, the relative importance and the specificity for a positive
contact for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should increase with the relative
decrease in SARS-CoV-2 environmental circulation compared to other microorganisms.
Conversely, contact with positive working partner also raises the risk of COVID-19,
although less substantially than when living with a positive contact. For this reason, a
positive working partner counts as 01 point.
Except for anosmia and ageusia, since symptoms of COVID-19 are unspecific in
the beginning of the disease, each symptom, not restricted to those classical ones,
should count as 03 points each. For matching similar sensitivity, two symptoms is
sufficient for the clinical diagnosis, since the chances of having infections other than
COVID-19 are low during the prevailing circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and spread use of
masks. However, the anxiety generated by the pandemic and the common inability to
differentiate between previous symptom patterns and new-onset symptoms may lead to
overdiagnosis of COVID-19, and this should be always considered when COVID-19
related anxiety states are detected.

As shown in the scoring system, 04 points are sufficient to start specific approaches and
treatments in case of high risk patients. This is particularly important for elders since
their clinical presentation may not always be as typical and may be blunted.
Finally, the presence of anosmia or ageusia, contact with a positive household and at
least one symptom, or the presence of three or more symptoms irrespective of known
positive contact are the three major key clinical diagnostic possibilities.
The present scoring is valid while use of masks is obligatory, population vaccinated is
below 70%, and transmission rate is > 1.0 or < 1.0 for less than four weeks. Increase for
04 points for the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be considered if any of these criteria is
no longer met.

High risk patients

The determination of which subjects were at high risk for COVID-19 was based
on the medical literature, and include subjects above 60 y/o, males with androgenetic
alopecia (AGA), females with hyperandrogenic states, and those presenting metabolicrelated conditions, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension (16).

Follow-up

Subjects that do not fulfill criteria for COVID-19 should be reassessed for
clinical symptoms and contact on a daily basis in the following three days, since new
symptoms should appear on those who present actual COVID-19, which will raise the
score in the following days and allow the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, timely for
appropriate management, before any complication. Patients with 4 or 5 points should be

particularly reassessed, once COVID-19 progresses to more severe states quickly. These
patients should be clinically reassessed even with a negative rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 since
the sensitivity of this test is lower than 80% to 90%, and tends to be lower in the early
days of the disease.

Discussion
Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 finds multiple advantages over the need of a
rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 test, including reduction of costs, since rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 has a
relatively high cost, prevention of further delays in therapeutical approaches for
COVID-19, and few severe harms compared to multiple potential benefits of early and
‘overdiagnosis’, in comparison to ‘underdiagnosis’, of COVID-19.
With the present thorough analysis of 1,757 subjects suspected for COVID-19,
we found sufficient substantiation to recommend against a mandatory rtPCR-SARSCoV-2 for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in highly suspected subjects. This should reduce
the screening costs and the inequity caused by the lack of wide access to rtPCR-SARSCoV-2. For patients clinically diagnosed for COVID-19 through our clinical scoring
system, rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 should be avoided because clinical diagnosis has
demonstrated higher accuracy than virological one, at least when compared to
commercially available rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 kit tests. In case of a negative rtPCRSARS-CoV-2, because of its overwhelming risk of being a false negative result, clinical
diagnosis, rather than test result, must be considered.
To overcome false negative rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 that may lead to loss of timely
detection of subjects developing severe COVID-19, we proposed a for moderately
suspected patients, a second consecutive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 to be repeated between

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248803; this version posted January 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this

24 and 72 hours after the first test, since more than 80% of those with a first negative
rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 showed a positive result when performed again.
A clinical, early diagnosis of COVID-19 is particularly important for subjects at
higher risk to develop severe COVID-19. Elders, for instance, may present even lower
sensitivity for a rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 test. In addition, their clinical presentation may
not always be as typical as the already unspecific symptoms found in COVID-19. This
population could be particularly benefited from the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in
order to prevent the development of more severe states.
Additional interesting findings were unveiled by the present analysis. Only 1 in
every 7 subjects with COVID-19 had anosmia or ageusia with known household
contact. This means that for every 7 patients with COVID-19, 6 will not present
anosmia and known contact with positive household. This finding finds importance in
the policies for COVID-19 diagnosis.
The unique characteristics of the pandemic and the peculiarities of the virus does
not allow an undisputed method of establishing clinical criteria. However, by assessing
subjects with any type of sign to suspect for COVID-19 – symptoms, confirmed
contact, or both – this clinical diagnostic tool represented a virtually 100% sensitive
flowchart. The only non-encompassed group that could miss sensitivity were
asymptomatic patients without known confirmed contacts. However, this population is
highly unlikely affected, and should be the least priority when tested.
Shortness of breath with oxygen saturation > 94% is more likely due to anxiety
induced by COVID-19 than the disease per se. Oppositely, the ‘happy hypoxia’ shows
that shortness of breath due to COVID-19 only occurs when oxygen saturation are
overtly low. However, since the present clinical diagnosis aims to counteract with the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.23.20248803; this version posted January 4, 2021. The copyright holder for this

prevailing inertia that led to an excessive number of deaths due to COVID-19, we
recommend for the investigation of shortness of breath, regardless of oxygen saturation.
Similarly, although the number of symptoms alone can lead to a large number of
false positive COVID-19 diagnosis, the counterbalance for the highly specific but not
sensitive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 in the current context of the pandemics, when high
sensitivity must be targeted.
The prevalence of anosmia and ageusia was lower than our data of the trials
because some of the subjects positive for COVID-19 developed these symptoms after
the diagnosis.

Recommendations based on the findings
1. While tests are not extremely sensitive and pretests are high, the employment
of rtPCT-SARS-CoV-2 as the sole diagnostic method for patients with
pretest probability above 80% should be considered a misuse of the test.
2. Since sensitivity also varies according to the viral load, clinical diagnosis
should be preferred over virological methods during the pandemics.
3. We recommend against the use of rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 if our proposed
scores indicate the diagnosis of COVID-19.
4. While determining the exact threshold of the pretest, above which a
biochemical test becomes unnecessary, although challenging, is questionable
in the current context, because factors used to determine the thresholds
should not only depend on the test sensitivity and posttest probability, but
also on the numbers and consequences of missing COVID-19 diagnosis.
5. Whenever the chances of corresponding positive test is above its sensitivity,
we considered the clinical diagnosis as presumed.

6. Scoring points may be adapted according to region-specific clinical
presentation, transmission rates, and potential viral mutations
7. The present clinical scoring for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 should only
be valid when transmission rate is above 1.0 or below 1.0 for less than 4
weeks and masks are widely used.
8. The present score should be reassessed after 70% of population has been
vaccinated.
9. We recommend for the reassessment of drugs with potential antiviral activity
when using the present, actual early COVID-19 diagnosis, since they may
present effectiveness if used early, unlike the lack of results when
administrated later in the disease.
10. While SARS-CoV-2 remains as the prevailing circulating virus, masks
effectively block bacterial infections, and rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 still underdetect COVID-19, the use of a score for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19
should be considered as the first line diagnostic tool.

Limitations

While we matched rtPCR results with clinical aspects to determine the pretest
probability, this determination of pretest probability is imprecise due to the still
challenging and largely unclear understanding of the COVID-19 transmission patterns.
The present scoring system was based on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and clinical
characteristics of a specific region, and may not precisely reflect the patterns present in
other regions.

Conclusion

The AndroCoV Clinical Scoring for COVID-19 diagnosis was demonstrated to
be a feasible, fast, inexpensive and sensitive diagnostic tool for a clinical diagnosis of
COVID-19, that avoids delays and missed diagnosis, and should be recommended as a
first-line option for COVID-19 diagnosis for public health policies.
