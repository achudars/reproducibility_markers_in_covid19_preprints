Abstract
Objective: The epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the entire health care
systems. Our aim was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the number and severity of cases
for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan.
Methods: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, we included
urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from August 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. We compared the monthly ratio
of inpatient cases from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year
comparison. We also compared this ratio according to the severity score “A-DROP” and performed an
interrupted time series analysis (ITS) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly
number of inpatient cases.
Results: A total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals were included. During the COVID-19
epidemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020), the number of inpatient cases for CAP
drastically decreased during the epidemic compared with the same period in the past year (-48.1%), despite
only a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases
decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the yearover-year ratio than severe ones (mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe 33.2%). The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 epidemic reduced the monthly number of inpatient
cases for CAP significantly (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI, -521 to -1955).
Conclusions: Our study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first recognized in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China
and spread globally in 2020 (Zhu et al., 2020). In Japan, the government focused on controlling the clusters
of infected cases by preventing the spread in closed spaces, crowded areas, and close-contact settings
(Shimizu et al., 2020). However, the daily number of new COVID-19 infections increased in March 2020.
The Japanese government declared, then, a state of emergency and requested self-quarantine and social
distancing in seven prefectures on April 7 and 47 prefectures on April 16 (Prime Minister of Japan and His
Cabinet, 2020). Consequently, the COVID-19 epidemic has changed the lifestyle of many Japanese as
individual hygiene, maintenance of social distance, and suspension of large-scale gatherings were strongly
encouraged.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as a lower respiratory tract infection that is acquired
outside of hospital setting (Metlay et al., 2019). CAP is one of the most common infectious disease
responsible for hospital admission and mortality, especially in the elderly. With the COVID-19 epidemic, the
decrease of inpatient and outpatient cases for CAP were reported (Wu et al., 2020; Yamamoto et al., 2020).
However, only a few studies focused on finding the type of CAP patients who were impacted by the COVID19 epidemic. Therefore, we performed a retrospective cohort study using a large-scale Japanese database.
Our study sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the number and severity of inpatients
for CAP in Japan.

Methods
Data source
For this retrospective cohort study, we extracted Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) data from the
Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database. The QIP is administered by the Department of
Healthcare Economics and Quality Management in Kyoto University (Hamada et al., 2012), which regularly
collects DPC data from acute care hospitals in Japan that voluntarily participate in the project. These
hospitals include both public and private facilities of various sizes. In 2019, the number of general beds at
the participating hospitals ranged from 30 to 1,151 (excluding psychiatric, infectious diseases, and
tuberculosis beds according to the Japanese classification of hospital beds). The DPC/per-diem payment
system (PDPS) is a Japanese prospective payment system applied to acute care hospitals. In 2018, a total of
1,730 hospitals used the DPC/PDPS, accounting for 54% (482,618 out of 891,872) of all the general hospital
beds in Japanese hospitals (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 2018; Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare, 2020). The DPC consists of several data files, including forms 1, 3, and 4 and files D, E, F, H, and
K (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 2020). For this study, we used form 1, file E, and file F. Form 1
contains discharge summaries, which include the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD10) codes classifying main diagnosis, the trigger diagnosis, the most and second-most medical-resourceintensive diagnoses, up to 10 comorbidities, and 10 complications during hospitalization. Form 1 also
includes the following patient details: age, sex, body mass index (BMI), components of the Barthel index

(independence of feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowels, bladder, toilet use, transfers from bed to
chair, mobility on level surfaces, and stairs), medical procedures, the pneumonia severity score according to
the A-DROP scoring system (a modified version of the CURB-65 scoring in Japan) at the onset, and the type
of pneumonia (community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, or diagnosis other than pneumonia).
Files E and F contain information on all medical services, medications, and equipment for both inpatients
and outpatients. File E and F include the name of the diagnosis, the start date of diagnosis, and the date of
visit for the outpatients.

Study population
This study includes cases of patients aged 18 years and older and who were hospitalized urgently for
pneumonia between August 1st, 2018 and July 31st, 2020. We defined urgent admission as unplanned hospital
admission and pneumonia as stipulated in the ICD-10 code in the 2013 version: J10.0, J11.0, J12.x-J18.x,
A48.1, B01.2, B05.2, B37.1, and B59.x. The exact contents of the ICD-10 codes are specified in table S1 in
the supplemental data. CAP was identified using the corresponding variable in the DPC data. We included
inpatient cases with ICD-10 codes in the following data fields: main diagnosis, trigger diagnosis, and most
medical resource-intensive diagnosis. We extracted the urgent admissions for diagnosis other than
pneumonia (other urgent admissions) for comparison. We also extracted the outpatient CAP cases newly
diagnosed with pneumonia from file E and F in the same period to evaluate the trend of overall patients with
CAP. Newly diagnosis of pneumonia was defined as the coincidence between the start date of diagnosis and

the date of visit.

Year-over-year comparison
The primary outcome of interest was the change in the monthly number of inpatient CAP cases during the
COVID-19 epidemic (defined as between March and July 2020). We retrospectively compared the monthly
ratio of inpatient cases between August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year
comparison. The year-over-year comparisons were also performed for other urgent admissions and outpatient
pneumonia cases.

We also performed the year-over-year comparison of the inpatient cases in each group of the A-DROP
scoring system from March to July in 2019 and 2020. The A-DROP system is a 6-point scale (0–5) that
assess the clinical severity of CAP according to the following parameters: (i) age (male ≥ 70 years, female
≥ 75 years), (ii) dehydration (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) ≥ 210 mg/L), (iii) respiratory failure (arterial
oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤ 90% or partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) ≤ 60 mmHg), (iv)
orientation disturbance (confusion), and (v) low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 90 mmHg)
(Shindo et al., 2008). We divided the A-DROP score into four severity classes (mild, 0; moderate, 1-2; severe,
3; and extremely severe, 4-5). Specifically, we used the locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to
visualize smooth trend curves.

Descriptive analysis
We compared the characteristic of inpatient cases from March to July 2019 and 2020. The characteristics
were described for the overall cases and each group of the A-DROP scoring system. We presented the body
mass index, the Carlson Comorbidity index, and the Barthel index variables because they are associated with
the mortality of inpatient pneumonia cases (Nguyen et al., 2019; Murcia et al., 2010; Takada et al., 2020).
Age and hospital length of stay were expressed as median values (interquartile range). We compared these
variables between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U tests. The categorical data (such as sex) were
compared using chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. All statistical analyses were performed with R version
3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Interrupted time series analyses for changes in case numbers
An interrupted time series analysis (ITS) was performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic
on the monthly number of inpatient cases (Bernal et al., 2017). We statistically tested the changes in the
number of monthly cases after adjusting for seasonality using a Fourier term. We hypothesized that the
COVID-19 epidemic would reduce the monthly number of cases after March 2020 since this was when the
first wave of COVID-19 started (Shimizu et al., 2020). We also conducted a sensitivity analysis. To assess
the sensitivity of our findings to a change in time point, we changed this parameter. The candidate
intervention time points were as follows: 1) February 2020, in Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare of Japan requested pharmacies and supermarkets to impose restrictions on purchases for the shortage
of face masks and disinfectants (Sakamoto et al., 2020), and 2) April 2020, the Government of Japan declared

the state of emergency (Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet, 2020). An interrupted time series analysis
was also performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the monthly number of outpatient
cases.

Results
We included a total of 67,900 inpatient CAP cases in 262 hospitals. We also extracted 1,425,133 other
urgent admission and 48,288 outpatient CAP cases. The monthly numbers of cases and year-over-year
ratios are displayed in table S2 in the supplemental material. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the number
of cases decreased compared with the same period the year before (inpatient CAP cases -48.1%, other
urgent admissions -9.1%, and outpatient CAP cases -26.7%). The year-over-year ratios of inpatient CAP
cases and other urgent admissions are illustrated in Figure 1. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the number
of inpatient CAP cases drastically decreased despite only a temporary reduction of the number of other
urgent admissions.

Figure 2: Year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases for community-acquired pneumonia
in each group of A-DROP scoring system

Table 1 displays the baseline characteristics of the inpatient cases in each group. Especially, the ratio of
inpatient cases with chronic pulmonary disease in the mild group was lower than during the same period in
2019 (21.5% vs 17.5%). For overall cases, the in-hospital mortality was more elevated during the COVID19 epidemic than the same period in 2019 (6.4% vs 9.3%). The ratio of several categories associated with
pneumonia mortality, such as the Charlson Comorbidity index≧1 (71.6% to 73.8%), the Charlson
Comorbidity index≧2 (40.8% to 43.9%), the Barthel index≦80 (50.7% to 54.2%), and BMI<17kg/m2
(14.1% to 16.7%), was also increased. In each group, the ratio of in-hospital death and these categories
were also increased.

The ITS analysis showed a significant reduction of the monthly number of inpatient CAP cases (estimated
decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI, -521 to -1955) and outpatient CAP cases (estimated decrease: -1808 cases;

95% CI, -656 to -2960). Our findings were largely unaffected by the change of the time point as shown in
Table S4 in the supplemental material.

Discussion
In this study, we used a large-scale administrative database to analyze the impact of the COVID-19
epidemic on the number and severity of inpatient CAP cases. Our main findings were as follows: first, a
significant reduction of the number of inpatient CAP cases despite an only temporary reduction of the
number of other urgent admissions during the COVID-19 epidemic; second, a greater decrease of the yearover-year ratio in milder cases; third, a significant decrease of the number of inpatient cases and outpatient
CAP cases.

The decrease of inpatient CAP cases was consistent with previous reports (Wu et al., 2020; Yamamoto et
al., 2020). Our study revealed that milder cases of pneumonia were associated with a greater decrease in the
year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases. Many patients were reluctant to seek medical
evaluation for fear of exposure to COVID-19 in the hospital in other departments, including pediatrics and
cardiology (Hammad et al., 2020; Lazzerini et al., 2020). The Japanese government urged patients with light
symptoms to stay at home on February 22, 2020 (Sakamoto et al., 2020). Therefore, the patients with mild
symptoms might have the same tendency to avoid medical visits in our study population.

Moreover, the change of lifestyle itself might reduce the onset of pneumonia. Our study included inpatient
cases in the elderly with a median age of 80. The main pathogens responsible for pneumonia in the elderly
include Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae (Janssens, 2005). The
aspiration of microorganisms inside the oral cavity is also a major cause of pneumonia in the elderly because
the elderly have risk factors including impaired swallowing and cough reflex (Mandell and Niederman,
2019). These bacteria do not spread directly from human to human. The COVID-19 epidemic changed the
patients’ lifestyle by encouraging individual-level hygiene (wearing a mask outside, keeping social distance,
disinfecting with alcohol, and washing hands frequently) and community-level prevention measures
(promotion of remote work, suspension of mass gathering, and school closure) (Abe et al., 2021). Limiting
family visits were carried out in many aged care facilities in Japan (ABC News, 2020). These lifestyle
changes might prevent many person-to-person disease transmissions, such as respiratory viral diseases
(Sakamoto et al., 2020; de Souza Luna et al., 2020; Sunagawa et al., 2021; Jones, 2020) and tuberculosis
(Komiya et al., 2020). A respiratory viral infection is an important risk factor for bacterial pneumonia because
respiratory viruses affect the pulmonary defense of the host and impair bacterial clearance (Prasso and Deng,
2017). A previous report showed a significant increase in hospitalizations due to pneumococcal pneumonia
during the 2009 influenza pandemic (Weinberger et al., 2012). The behavior change due to the COVID-19
infection control may prevent viral respiratory infection and consequently bacterial pneumonia. Therefore,
it might contribute to the decrease in the onset of pneumonia during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study also
showed the ratio of inpatient cases with milder chronic pulmonary disease decreased during the COVID-19

epidemic compared with the same period in 2019. Previous studies revealed that the change in patient
behavior and physical environment during the COVID-19 epidemic could contribute to the decrease in
hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma (Abe et
al., 2021; Chan et al., 2020). These changes could also contribute to the decrease in inpatient CAP cases,
especially for the patients with milder diseases. Other possibilities included the shortage of hospital beds and
manpower restricted to hospitalization (Zhou et al., 2020). However, table S2 revealed that the number of
other urgent admissions recovered to about 90%. This result suggests the absence of a large number of
restrictions. Additionally, the decline in outpatient CAP cases cannot be explained by the restrictions in
hospitalization.

Our study revealed that for overall cases and each group of A-DROP scoring system, the in-hospital mortality
was more elevated during the COVID-19 epidemic than the same period in 2019. A higher Charlson
Comorbidity index, functional dependence (Barthel index≦80 points), and BMI<17kg/m2 were associated
with higher mortality in patients with pneumonia (Nguyen et al., 2019; Murcia et al., 2010; Takada et al.,
2020). As shown in Table 1, the ratios in these categories increased during the COVID-19 epidemic. These
changes might contribute to the elevated mortality in each group of the A-DROP scoring system during the
COVID-19 epidemic.

Our study has several limitations. First, the study population was restricted to patients in hospitals that

voluntarily participated in the QIP. Therefore, a selection bias cannot be excluded. Second, the diagnoses of
the outpatient pneumonia cases recorded in files E and F were not classified as in form 1 and may not be
sufficiently robust. However, files E and F contained the start date of diagnosis and date of visit and allowed
us to extract the outpatient cases newly diagnosed with pneumonia. Therefore, the trend for the number of
outpatient pneumonia cases was approximately assessed. Despite these limitations, our research provided
important information on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on CAP inpatients using a large-scale
Japanese database. Further studies are warranted to identify the long-term impact of the decrease of inpatient
CAP cases on patient outcomes and health care systems.

In conclusion, we showed a marked reduction of inpatient CAP cases during the COVID-19 epidemic in
Japan using large-scale administrative data. The decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of
inpatient cases was greater for the milder pneumonia cases.
