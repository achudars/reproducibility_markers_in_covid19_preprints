Abstract

Introduction: During any emerging infectious disease outbreak, people with symptoms of the illness
are often asked to report their symptoms to the health service in a timely manner, to facilitate contact
tracing. Numerous factors may influence an individual’s willingness to report these symptoms.
Understanding these factors has become urgent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Objective: To determine which factors influence symptom reporting during an emerging infectious
disease outbreak.

Methods: We conducted a rapid review of the evidence. We included papers based on primary
research; published in a peer-reviewed journal; written in English; included factors associated with
symptom reporting or accessing healthcare; and related to a major public health incident involving an
infectious disease outbreak.

Main results: Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing
healthcare: accurate and informative communication; symptom severity; concern about exposure;

ease of access; and relationship with the healthcare provider. Seven themes were identified as
barriers of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: lack of knowledge; fear; stigmatization;
invasion of privacy; low concern about symptoms; economics; and practicalities of attending a
healthcare facility.

Discussion & Conclusion: If contract tracing services are to be effective, members of the public
need to have the capability, opportunity and motivation to use them. The themes identified should be
used to evaluate the information provided to the public about such a service, the routes of access,
and the underlying policies relating to the service, in order to ensure that as many people as possible
with relevant symptoms will make contact.

Introduction

Governments across the world are using contact tracing services in order to provide a route out of
lockdown from COVID-19. In the UK, the Government has launched a “Test, Trace and Isolate”
system. This requires people who develop a new, continuous cough, a fever, or a loss of their sense
of taste or smell (the ‘index case’) to follow a series of actions. First, they must book a test through a
drive-through facility or have a test delivered to their home. Second, they (and any household
members) must remain at home until they receive their test result. Third, for those who test positive,
further isolation is advised and a process of tracing the person’s close contacts begins. Contacts are
asked to quarantine themselves, and to request a test if they too, develop symptoms.

Every step of this system relies on people adhering to advice. To date, most attention has focused on
the challenges involved in helping index cases or their contacts adhere to advice to remain in isolation
or quarantine for the recommended period of time (1). However, challenges exist at every step. In this
paper, we focus on the very first steps in the patient pathway: recognizing that one has relevant
symptoms and reporting these to a health service (or in the case of the UK, deciding to request a
test).

This process can itself be broken down into stages. Symptom perception is determined partly by
physiological factors. These might include infection with COVID-19, but physical signs of illness can
also be triggered by other medical factors or environmental factors. Symptom perception is influenced
by multiple psychological and contextual factors, being more likely to occur among people who expect
to experience a given symptom, or who are worried or anxious, and are hence monitoring themselves
for symptoms (2, 3).

Seeking help, once a symptom has been perceived is then also determined by a range of factors.
The person’s attribution of their symptoms plays a key role; most symptoms experienced in everyday
life are appraised as being transient and benign, and are not brought to the attention of the health
services. This appraisal is partly based on the severity, suddenness and duration of the symptom.
Minor, gradually evolving and transient symptoms are less likely to be interpreted as indicating
something troubling (4). However, awareness of specific health risks is also important. For example,

not recognizing a symptom as a possible warning sign is a key factor underlying delayed help seeking
for cancer (5, 6) and rheumatoid arthritis (4, 7, 8).

Regardless of the cause of an individual’s symptoms, once the person has decided they have a
problem, the decision to seek help can be complex and result in delay. For example, an analysis in
England found that of the 1732 people who described having what the authors termed an ‘alarm’
symptom for cancer over the past three months, 28.4% had not yet consulted a doctor about an
unexplained lump, 30.4% had not sought help for unexplained pain, and 45.8% had not sought help
for unexplained bleeding (9). Important factors influencing the decision to seek help include the fear of
being seen as ‘a time-waster’ (4, 5, 10), competing demands on one’s time (5, 10), worries about the
impact or efficacy of any intervention that might be offered (4, 5), pressure from friends and family
(11, 12) and perceptions that one is complying with official advice or using a service appropriately (1315).

We are not aware of any currently published systematic reviews which explore factors associated with
facilitating or deterring people from reporting symptoms during major health incidents involving an
infectious disease outbreak. In this paper, we report a rapid review of the literature, to determine what
factors influence symptom reporting during such an incident.

Methods

Following the PRISMA guidelines (16) we developed a protocol for a rapid review to determine what
factors influence symptom reporting during major health incidents.

Search strategy

We developed a search strategy which included medical subject headings and free text terms. Key
words for the search included terms for epidemics/pandemics (including coronavirus, avian influenza,
Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, swine flu) and terms

characterizing symptom reporting (including help-seeking behaviour, symptom reporting, stigma,
requesting/asking for a test). Three electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest) were
searched from inception to June 2020, the full list of search terms can be found in Appendix A.

Selection criteria

For studies to be included in this review, they had to: report on primary research; be published in a
peer-reviewed journal; be written in English; include factors associated with reporting symptoms to a
healthcare unit, or accessing healthcare (i.e. facilitators, barriers, or features associated with the
reporting of symptoms or accessing of healthcare) and include participants with experience of a major
health incident, which had to be viral, contagious and not sexually transmitted. Citations from each
database search were downloaded into EndNote and duplicates removed. Titles and abstracts of
identified studies were screened by two reviewers for inclusion against criteria, until a good inter-rater
reliability had been observed (percentage agreement =>90%). Initially 10% of references were
double-screened, and as inter-rater agreement was good (98%), the remaining references were
screened by one reviewer. All primary-level studies included after the first screen of citations were
acquired in full and re-evaluated for eligibility (see Appendix B for studies that were excluded at fulltext review).

Data extraction and synthesis

Data extraction and synthesis was conducted independently by two reviewers, and discrepancies or
difficulties with coding were resolved through discussion. Quality of each included study was
assessed using the CASP (Critical Appraisals Skills Programme) Qualitative checklist for qualitative
studies (17) or the BMJ Critical appraisal checklist for survey studies (18). A quality rating was
assigned to each study, where ++ indicates that most (≥75%) or all of the checklist criteria have been
met, + indicates that the checklist criteria have been partially met (≥50%-75%), and – indicates that
the majority of checklist criteria have not been met (<50%). Thematic synthesis was used to
inductively identify emerging themes in qualitative findings across studies. Themes from individual

studies were integrated into a wider context, with overarching categories of themes and subthemes
being developed. Themes were derived from the data presented within the included studies, emerging
themes were placed into a thematic map representing the relationship between the overarching
categories, themes and subthemes. Narrative synthesis was used to combine and summarise the
findings from survey studies, this was embedded within the context of the qualitative findings to
provide an overall narrative of the data.

Results

The systematic search of electronic databases generated a total of 2107 references, and two
additional references were identified through hand searching. Of these 2109 references, 58 were
reviewed in full-text. Sixteen studies met the eligibility criteria (see Figure 1 for flow chart of study
search and selection process).

Included studies

The characteristics of the included studies are summarised in Table 1. Half the studies used
qualitative methods (11, 19-25) and half used quantitative surveys (26-33).

The studies were conducted across 12 countries and included people with experience of the 2009
and 2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic (11, 24, 26, 27, 32), Ebola (20, 21, 23, 25, 33), avian influenza
(29, 30), acute respiratory illness (22), influenza-like illness (28, 31) and any infectious disease (19).

Identified themes

Five themes were identified as facilitators of symptom reporting or accessing healthcare: accurate
and informative communication; symptom severity; concern about exposure; ease of access;
relationship with healthcare provider. Seven themes were identified as barriers of symptom reporting

or accessing healthcare: lack of knowledge; fear; stigmatization; invasion of privacy; low concern
about symptoms; economics; practicalities of attending healthcare facility. See Figure 2 and 3 for
theme maps for facilitators and barriers of symptom reporting. These themes (and subthemes) are
elaborated below. The synthesis of quantitative survey data also highlighted a number of
demographic features associated with those reporting symptoms and those seeking healthcare,
summarised below.

Facilitators of symptom reporting/accessing healthcare

Accurate and informative communication

Participants found that education about symptoms (19, 21, 30, 31) and about routes of transmission
(30) enabled them to feel confident about reporting symptoms and seeking help. Participants
emphasized that they would be happier to report symptoms if they understood the rationale behind
reporting, and if their personal responsibility was emphasised (19):

“I think most people would be happy if they knew there was a risk, if you could tell them why you’re
asking the questions.” ((19), pg. 9)

Participants also highlighted that having confidence that the reporting system was effective and
efficient would facilitate reporting (19).

Symptom severity

Participants reported that the unusualness of symptoms, particularly in terms of severity and duration,
were powerful prompts to access healthcare (11, 29)

"I've had a cold and I’ve had the flu and it only lasted about 2 days. But I had this for about a week
and a half. It’s the first I've had a cold that long and I was just thinking the worst" ((11) pg. 3)

Early access to healthcare was also facilitated when people perceived the illness as dangerous (29,
30). Participants were more motivated to seek treatment earlier when the importance of early
response was emphasised, and where exposure to survivors built hope about recovery (21, 29).
Participants expressed the view that if they were confident that they were experiencing a genuine
illness they would feel comfortable about disclosing symptoms (19).

Concern about exposure

Participants were motivated to seek advice if they were concerned or uncertain about exposure (11).
Another related motivator was a desire to gain peace of mind (11). Furthermore, those with personal
risk factors (including age and underlying health conditions) were particularly compelled to contact
healthcare services (11). Social pressures also facilitated help-seeking behaviour, both in terms of
fears about exposing others to the disease, and pressure from others to report symptoms (11).

Ease of access

The physical proximity of healthcare facilities and the importance that these were local and
community-based was highlighted as facilitators to accessing healthcare as the people working in
those facilities would be more likely to be known and trusted (20, 25). Being able to walk to facilities
also resolved transportation issues from a practical perspective, and provided an emotional facilitating
factor as many participants described an intense fear of ambulances (20, 22)

Relationship with healthcare provider

Participants were more likely to seek help if they were encouraged to do so by familiar and trusted
healthcare professionals (20). Help-seeking behaviour was also facilitated through healthcare
professional’s willingness to discuss symptoms and provide information (22). Conversely, having to

contact a new and unknown healthcare provider was highlighted as a barrier that delayed the decision
to seek healthcare (24).

Barriers of symptom reporting/accessing healthcare

Lack of knowledge

Participants described a poor understanding of the characteristics of a new disease and how this
could act as a barrier to help-seeking behaviour (19, 25). More specifically, participants talked about
gaps in knowledge about symptoms (33) gaps in knowledge about testing (20, 25) and gaps in
knowledge about treatment (20, 25) and how these gaps could be filled with rumours and myths that
could make people even more fearful about accessing healthcare:

“There were rumors that the needle to test you actually is poison and the test kills you.” ((20), pg. 68)

Fear

Fear emerged as a recurrent barrier to symptom reporting, this included: fear of the what may happen
if a person caught the disease, fear of receiving treatment, and of the treatment system (20); fear of
being infected in a healthcare setting (23); fears of being sucked into the system that arose when
people witnessed sick people being taken away and never returning (20, 25); fear of the hospital or
clinic environment (24, 25, 33); fear of the reaction they may receive from the healthcare worker, i.e.
of not being believed (19) or of being seen to make a fuss (33).

Stigmatisation

Participants anticipated stigmatization and the desire to avoid this created a barrier to reporting
symptoms (19, 22, 23). People worried about experiencing stigma in the workplace, in the wider

community, and were concerned about social stigma that may be attached to family members of
those who had developed severe illness.

Invasion of privacy

Participants were wary that detailed questioning about symptoms could be experienced as an
invasion of privacy and create or increase feelings of anxiety and distrust (19). The need for the
protection of employee privacy and confidentiality was also raised, in the context of healthcare
workers reporting symptoms (19).

Low concern about symptoms

Juxtaposed against the finding that concern about exposure could act as a facilitator to symptom
reporting, others experienced low concern about symptoms and this acted as a barrier to helpseeking. For some people, this took the form of a fatalistic approach, with tests being perceived as
pointless and disease inevitable (21), or the lack of an effective treatment delaying the decision to
seek healthcare (24). Others just did not feel sufficiently ill to report symptoms or access healthcare
(25, 29, 33):

"Because based on what the medical people say, if it is high fever, then you will say this has gone
beyond limit. Because there are times when we get malaria and common cold before this Ebola. So
you cannot just start feeling feverish and you say you have to call 117." ((25) pg. 7)

Some participants believed that there was no need to access healthcare as they would get better on
their own (22, 29), or preferred to try home-based healthcare as a first-line treatment option (23-25).

One study found that exposure to media coverage reduced worry and decreased healthcare service
use. (32)

All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Economics

Economic barriers to accessing healthcare were also experienced, because participants could not
afford healthcare (23-25), or were worried about a negative impact on their employment or had no
paid sick leave (24).

Practicalities of attending a healthcare facility

For some people the healthcare facility was too far away to travel to (29), and a lack of transportation
(23, 24, 29), or not being able to afford to travel (29) imposed practical barriers to accessing
healthcare, particularly for those living in rural communities. Other practical barriers to help-seeking
behaviour included: not having time to visit a healthcare facility (29); lacking childcare (29); and a
language or communication barrier (24).

Associated features of those reporting symptoms

Three studies found that women were more likely to report symptoms than men (26, 28, 31), we
cannot however, determine if this is because women were more likely to contract the illness. Two
studies reported that older people (aged 65 years or over) were less likely to report symptoms than
those who could be categorized as younger or middle-aged, although these age bands were large,
covering 18 to 49 year olds (26) or 25-64 years (28). One study found that white participants were
more likely to report symptoms than black participants (26). However, the relationship of ethnicity and
reporting was more complex than all black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups being less likely to
report symptoms, as the same study (26) found that American Indian/Alaska Native participants were
more likely to report symptoms than white adults. Finally, two studies found that people with higher
levels of education were more likely to report symptoms than those who had spent less time in
education.

Associated features of those seeking healthcare

Two studies found that women were more likely to seek medical care than men (26, 31). In an
opposite pattern to the reporting of symptoms, one study reported that those with primary level
education or below were more likely to seek medical care than those with tertiary education or above
(31). One study found that people from ethnic minority groups were more likely to access healthcare
(32). Two studies reported that those with underlying health conditions (31, 32) were more likely to
have sought medical care, and one of those studies also found that people living in larger households
(Rubin 2010b) were more likely to access healthcare. Again, within this review we cannot determine if
greater levels of seeking healthcare by these groups is due to an increased likelihood that they have
contracted the illness. Finally, mixed results were reported across studies on the association between
age and healthcare seeking behaviour, with two studies finding that older adults (aged at least 60 or
65 years) were more likely to seek healthcare (26, 31), and another study in which participants
indicated that they felt too old to seek care (29). Another two studies found no direct association
between age and help-seeking behaviour, but found relationships with other variables. One study
reported a relationship between age and gender with males under the age of 25 being more likely to
seek medical attention than women under the age of 25 (27). Another study reported a relationship
between age and ethnicity, as for BAME respondents the longest duration between onset of
symptoms and seeking initial treatment was found for an older age group, while for white respondents
the longest duration was reported by children and young people (24).

Discussion

Principal finding

The evidence within this review shows a number of distinct factors which can act as either facilitators
or barriers to people reporting symptoms to, or seeking care from, the health services during an
emerging infectious disease outbreak. These include fear or concern about exposure, knowledge &
information, level of concern over symptoms, and practical considerations. Additional factors are

related to invasion of privacy and stigmatisation. A number of demographic factors should also be
considered, including sex, age, ethnicity and education.

Interpretation of results

Our thematic analysis identified four main themes which facilitate people either reporting symptoms or
accessing health care facilities: symptom severity, concern about exposure, accurate and informative
communication, relationship with health care provider and ease of access. For example when
information is accurate, and communicated effectively people understand why they need to report
symptoms, and feel enabled to do so (19), whereas when people have a poor understanding, either
about testing, the disease, or disease symptoms they appear reluctant to visit a healthcare facility or
report symptoms (20, 25). Public health officials need to ensure people receive appropriate
information, working with the media, who during major health crisis play an important role (34). Calls
for good communication are, of course, nothing new in the field of emergency response. However, we
make no apologies for raising it once more. Without sustained effort on the part of official
communicators, knowledge among the public can be surprisingly low. For example, five months into
the COVID-19 pandemic only 59% of the UK population knew what symptoms they were being asked
to be alert to (35). Additionally, the role of healthcare professionals is important, the data showed that
people were more positive when the healthcare provider seemed willing to give them information and
talk to them (22).

Accurate and informative communication links closely to the identified themes, “symptom severity” (a
facilitator), and the theme “low concern about symptoms” (a barrier). If people are not sufficiently
educated about relevant symptoms they may not feel it is appropriate to access healthcare, or report
their symptoms; therefore, clear advice on severity and nature of symptoms is needed. These data
are consistent with other studies which have shown that when people think their symptoms are minor
or unimportant, they are less likely to report them (4). When people believed they had a genuine
illness, and that symptoms were severe or serious, they would report them (19). These findings are
supported by studies which show the greater the perceived perception of illness severity, the more
likely they are to engage in precautionary behaviours (36), for example contacting the healthcare

service. While in daily life, such attitudes may be appropriate, during the COVID-19 outbreak, this
represents a substantial problem for testing and contact tracing services. Given that people are
infectious even if asymptomatic, it is essential to encourage people to report even mild symptoms
without delay. A focus on this in messaging will be required, as our data suggest that this runs
contrary to most people’s natural inclinations.

Anxiety about exposure also increased people’s motivations to seek advice or report symptoms.
When people were concerned that their individual situation increased their susceptibility to a disease,
they were more likely to engage with the healthcare system. In contrast, fear about what might
happen next once ‘within the system’ was identified consistently across studies, where it acted as a
barrier to reporting symptoms. These findings suggest that it is important to reduce fear about being
infected by visiting a healthcare setting, or about receiving treatment, but instilling a sufficiently
realistic degree of concern about the illness that motivates people to engage with the system.

Practical issues were regularly reported in the evidence. Having a health care facility embedded in
the local community, and within walking distance was a facilitator for people reporting symptoms.
However, when facilities were deemed too far to get to, too expensive to travel to, or too difficult to
travel to, this was seen as a barrier. The cost of accessing the healthcare system was also a
consideration for many. Indirect economic factors were also important. People reported difficulties
with getting time of work and not having paid sick leave. During an emerging infectious disease
outbreak, tackling economic barriers to seeking testing should be an essential component of any fully
functioning public health response.

Evidence on the associated features for those seeking healthcare and those reporting symptoms
showed clear differences between women and men, different age groups, and people from different
ethnic backgrounds. Studies showed that women consistently reported symptoms more often, and
were more likely to seek healthcare than men; highlighting that more needs to be done to engage the
male population. However, the data were not consistent in relation to age or ethnicity.

Strengths & Limitations

Despite this being a rapid review of the evidence, we conducted a comprehensive search strategy
across multiple databases, with screening conducted by two independent reviewers. The review
includes 16 studies providing a depth of evidence from across the globe, supporting the
generalisability of findings. We have described these studies in detail, and demonstrated clear
themes in the analysis to enhance understanding of the existing evidence. However, as with all rapid
reviews, several limitations must be considered. We cannot rule out the possibility that other
potentially relevant evidence exists which has not been included. Additionally, a number of the
included studies were rated moderate or low quality, this was often due to suboptimal reporting of
included participants and research methods.

Conclusion

Findings from this review suggest that in the context of the COVID pandemic, governments seeking to
increase the proportion of symptomatic people accessing testing services should:

1.

Ensure information on symptoms is clear; that reporting a new, continuous cough, a

fever, or a loss of sense of taste or smell is important. It must be emphasised even mild or
minor symptoms must be reported without delay;
2.

Make testing facilities easy to access and remove any economic barriers associated

with their use;
3.

Provide assurance that testing facilities are safe from infection;

4.

Target the male population to increase their uptake of services.
