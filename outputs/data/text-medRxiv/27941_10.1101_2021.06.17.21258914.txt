Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to
health systems worldwide, including the control of non-COVID-19 diseases. Malaria cases
and deaths may increase due to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in malaria
endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Objectives: This scoping review aims to summarize information on public health
relevant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria situation in SSA.
Methods: Review of publications and manuscripts on preprint servers, in peerreviewed journals and in grey literature documents from December 1, 2019, to June 9, 2021.
A structured search was conducted on different databases using predefined eligibility criteria
for the selection of articles.
Results: A total of 51 papers have been included in the analysis. Modeling papers have
predicted a significant increase in malaria cases and malaria deaths in SSA due to the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many papers provided potential explanations for expected
COVID-19 effects on the malaria burden; these ranged from relevant diagnostic and clinical
aspects, to reduced access to health care services, impaired availability of curative and
preventive commodities and medications, and effects on malaria prevention campaigns.
Compared to previous years, fewer country reports provided data on the actual number of
malaria cases and deaths in 2020, with mixed results. While highly endemic countries
reported evidence of decreased malaria cases in health facilities, low endemic countries
reported an overall higher numbers of malaria cases and deaths in 2020.
Conclusions: The findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but
diverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA. There is the need to further
investigate the public health consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the malaria burden.

Introduction
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China by the end of 2019 has led to the largest pandemic
in recent human history (1, 2). By June 14, 2021, there were some 176 million confirmed
cases of COVID-19, including 3.8 million deaths, reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO) (3). The COVID-19 epidemic waves show variable dynamics in the different WHO
Regions, with the highest burden in the American, European and South-East Asian Regions
(3, 4). The latter has recently shown particularly high incidence rates, and India is now
reporting the second highest number of confirmed cases after the USA (3). In contrast, the
African and the Western Pacific WHO Regions continue to report only relatively low
numbers of cases and deaths (3, 4).

It was initially predicted that Africa would be the worst affected region by the COVID-19
pandemic because of its weak health systems, prevailing poverty, and the high burden of other
infectious diseases (5, 6). However, by the end of 2020, only about 3.5% of the global number
of COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported from this continent, which is home to 17% of
the world’s population (3, 7). Overall, the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Africa remains
puzzling (5). By June 14, 2021, there were some 3.6 million COVID-19 cases and 89,000
deaths reported from the entire continent, and most of these were from its northern and
southern regions (8, 9). Potential explanations for such a situation are incomplete data due to
much lower testing capacities, a significantly younger population, overall lower population
mobility, cross-reactive immunity or immunomodulation due to high prevalence of other
infectious agents, and effects of public health responses (5, 7, 10). First findings from SARS3

CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys support the evidence for significant under-reporting and for a
predominance of asymptomatic and mild cases (11, 12). Nevertheless, it appears that the
second epidemic wave has hit the African continent more severely than the first one, possibly
explained by the emergence of more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (7, 13).

Globally, malaria is still the most important parasitic disease and responsible for a quarter of
all deaths among Under Five children in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (14, 15). The efforts for
global malaria control and elimination have achieved large successes during the last two
decades, but progress has stalled in recent years, and the COVID-19 pandemic could largely
reverse the overall trend (16, 17). This review aims to summarize currently available data and
understanding of the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria
burden in SSA.

Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
Due to the complex topic and the different type of studies available, a scoping review
methodology was chosen (18). The study protocol (published on OFS, DOI:
10.17605/OSF.IO/STQ9D) complies with the ‘Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist’ (19). The
following inclusion criteria were applied: Papers needed to respect the categories of the PICoframework (Problem: malaria situation; Interest: the public health impact of the COVID-19
pandemic; Context: sub-Saharan Africa) (20). No restrictions regarding the study type and the
publication status were applied. Possible languages included English, French and German.
Papers published between December 1, 2019, and June 9, 2021, were included. In line with
the protocol, the search strategy was developed, and the following databases were searched:
PubMed; Ovid MEDLINE(R); Web of Science; Biosis Previews; MedRxiv, and The Lancet.

Grey literature was included using WHO database and Google Scholar. Three broad blocks of
search terms were used: (1) COVID-19, (2) malaria, (3) sub-Saharan Africa. The detailed
search strategy is available in appendix 1.

For the extracted findings two researcher (OM and AH) conducted independently the title
screening, then the abstract screening and finally the full text review. The papers selected for
full-text reading were assessed for eligibility; ineligible papers did not include information on
public health relevant consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA. Inclusion
decisions depended on whether the paper agreed to the PICo-framework and the formal
eligibility criteria. Results were compared after each step for discussion and for reaching a
consensus. For the analysis of the finally included papers, a data extraction table was
constructed (appendix 2).

The following information was extracted from the papers: Authors, title, study place, study
population, study design and outcome. Moreover, the papers were categorized by study type:
modeling study, report (country report, general report, case report), review, opinion paper,
and policy guideline. The information content was structured and analyzed around the
following themes:
•

Modeled impact of COVID-19 on malaria

•

Diagnostic and clinical aspects

•

Access to health care services

•

Availability of curative and preventive malaria commodities

•

Impact on malaria programs

•

Epidemiologic data from countries

Modeled impact of COVID-19 on malaria
Five papers predicted the evolution of the malaria burden in SSA based on different potential
scenarios. Considering primarily a reduced access to effective antimalarial treatment and
reduced insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) distribution, Weiss et al. predicted in their
worst-case scenario (75% less anti-malarial drugs and ITNs) and for the year 2020 that in
SSA countries malaria cases would increase by 22% (from 215 to 262 million) and malaria

deaths by 99% (from 386,000 to 769,000); the lower access to antimalarial treatment had a
larger effect than reduced ITN distribution (21). These estimates mirror those by the WHO,
but the authors described the effects of nine different scenarios compared to the effects of
three scenarios by Weiss et al. (22). Comparable estimates were published by Sherrard-Smith
et al.; for the scenario of complete interruption of ITN distribution and 50% decreased access
to antimalarials they predicted malaria deaths would increase in SSA to 779,000 for the year
2020 (23). A further analysis by WHO predicted up to 100,000 additional deaths in 2020 with
a 50% lower access to antimalarials (17). However, all these authors emphasized that the
projected effects on malaria services and mortality are highly uncertain because these
estimates are heavily dependent on how countries respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Regarding the relative burden of COVID-19 in Africa, one study concluded that the excess
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost by malaria due to COVID-19 may exceed those
directly lost due to COVID-19 (24).

Diagnostic and clinical aspects
The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and malaria largely overlap; fever, headache, joint
pain, respiratory symptoms, and general weakness are frequently seen with both diseases (2527). Thus, diagnosis based on symptoms alone can result in inadequate treatment, with
potentially harmful consequences. Untreated malaria can be rapidly fatal and COVID-19
patients must be quarantined to interrupt community transmission (14, 28). Despite increasing
availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria in all endemic areas, presumptive
diagnosis of malaria is still common in SSA, and the WHO Malaria Technical Guidelines
adapted to COVID-19 confirm this situation (29, 30). Initial information available for 2020
suggests major disruptions in malaria diagnosis and treatment due to COVID-19 (31, 32).

Human travel history is important for SARS-CoV-2 and malaria, as for both of them
asymptomatic persons can spread and/or maintain transmission of the infectious agent (26).
Moreover, malaria and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections may be associated with clinical disease
modification, although data on this are limited (27, 33-35).

While symptomatic malaria affects mainly children and younger age groups in endemic areas,
COVID-19 affects all age groups but is more frequently symptomatic and severe with
increasing age (33). However, in areas of low malaria transmission, the age groups affected
by the two diseases largely overlap (36). RDTs are essential for malaria diagnosis in rural
SSA and may also become important for COVID-19, as the PCR test capacity is very limited
(32). However, the impact of rather low sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 RDTs is still
under intense discussion (27, 37). Additional challenges for differential diagnosis is the
increasing frequency of gene-mutated Plasmodium parasites, especially in the Horn of Africa,
that escape detection by standard RDTs (36).

The role of the artemisinin derivate and chloroquine (CQ) antimalarials in the COVID-19
pandemic is complex. Various artemisinin derivates, artemisinin-based combination therapies
(ACTs) as well as CQ have been shown to be effective against SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2 in vitro (38-41). However, such beneficial effect has not been confirmed by several
clinical trials (42-45). The wide use of these treatments in highly malaria endemic countries
has been suggested to be responsible for the reported low COVID-19 burden in SSA (35, 46).
On the other hand, the increased usage of these drugs for COVID-19 prevention and treatment
in some malaria endemic countries might have reduced malaria (25). A frequent off-label use
of artemisinin-based drugs may also increase the likelihood of emerging drug resistance and
thus threatens the most important of the remaining effective antimalarials (47-50).

Access to health care services
The COVID-19 pandemic in SSA endangers access to health care services due to several
factors. Direct factors include restricted services and closures of health facilities because of
reduced health care worker (HCW) capacity due to lack of personal protective equipment
(PPE), stigmatization, fear of getting infected, or absence due to COVID-19 disease or death
(27, 32, 50, 51). Delayed treatment results in prolonged gametocyte carriage and additional
opportunities for transmission.

Moreover, because of overload of COVID-19 patients and consequently reduced time to
manage other diseases, or due to movement and travel restrictions and for fear of becoming
infected with COVID-19, sick individuals with diseases other than COVID-19 do no longer
attend health facilities (47, 48, 52). As older people fear severe COVID-19 disease and may
thus avoid visiting health facilities, this might affect children the most as they depend on their
care givers if sick, including for malaria (34, 49). Stay-at-home advices for febrile diseases,
especially at the beginning of the pandemic, enhanced such a behavior (17, 48).

Indirect factors include reduced income during lockdowns due to inability to perform
informal work, and subsequently reduced purchasing power (52). The resulting increase in
poverty leads to challenges for paying the costs for routine care, drugs, or transportation fees
(51). Lockdowns and movement restrictions further complicate access to health facilities and
have also threatened the functioning of malaria surveillance systems (28, 48, 51). Institutional
mistrust and lack of valid information further reduced visits to health care facilities and
reduced uptake of preventive measures; as an example, myths about the spread of COVID-19
via ITNs led to a reduced usage of this essential intervention in Sierra Leone (25).

Availability of curative and preventive commodities and medicines

Increased material costs, reluctance of producers to invest, travel restrictions, border closures,
and lockdowns resulted in a lower availability of medical malaria products (26, 28, 47). Lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected as they essentially rely
on importation of these commodities (52). Excessive use of antimalarials for COVID-19
prevention and treatment in some regions has led to shortages for their original purpose (17,
30). Some international companies switched from the production of malaria products to
COVID-19 products (47, 49, 51). Difficult access to health facilities lowered the availability
of essential drugs and increased their price, with subsequent increases in purchase and usage
of sub-standard drugs and alternative medicines (28, 51-53). In addition, PPE needed for the
implementation of different malaria services (e.g. indoor residual spraying of insecticides,
IRS) have become scarce and expensive on global markets (17, 54).

Impact of the pandemic on malaria programs
The extent of the pandemic’s impacts on malaria depends on the timing of its waves. The
largest effects may occur if the COVID-19 transmission peaks and the planned malaria
campaigns overlap (21, 23, 53, 55). About three quarters of malaria-affected countries
reported disruptions of malaria services and programs (17, 32, 48, 50, 53, 56-58).
Reallocation of funds from other disease control programs to the control of COVID-19 have
been common and pose great problems for malaria control (30, 32, 34, 59, 60). Ongoing
malaria programs (e.g. IRS, ITN interventions) need to be adapted to the restrictions
associated with COVID-19 control measures, which requires additional financial resources
(32, 35, 48). Programs for vulnerable populations living in remote areas are particularly at
risk as they strongly depend on logistics and external financing (47, 48). Disrupted ITN
programs will lead to increased malaria transmission as 80% of them are distributed through
mass campaigns (22, 47, 53, 55). IRS campaigns face many challenges as they require direct
household contact (48, 50, 57).

Nevertheless, these challenges led to new approaches: Benin digitalized its ITN mass
distribution campaign using a ‘no touch’ payment for campaign workers. The national
strategy was changed from a fixed-point to a door-to-door-distribution procedure, which
enabled health workers to provide additional community health education on COVID-19 and
other aspects; other countries followed the Benin model and by the end of 2020, 90% of all
globally planned malaria prevention campaigns had been implemented (17, 28, 54, 57, 59).

Epidemiologic data from countries
Compared to previous years, fewer papers provided data from African countries on the actual
number of malaria cases and deaths in 2020. A small study from Sierra Leone reported a
significant lower number of malaria outpatient visits in one health facility during the
March/April 2020 lockdown period as compared to the same period in 2019 (29). In addition,
preliminary national data from Uganda point to a reduction of malaria cases seen in health
facilities during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (61). Another
study from Uganda reported a 54% decrease in visits for malaria treatment of febrile children;
visits for antenatal care declined by 26%, restricting the delivery of intermittent preventive
malaria treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) (62). In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
lower attendance to health facilities for malaria treatment ranged from 20% to 90%,
depending on local lockdown measures (63). In contrast, a study from one rural district in
Zimbabwe reported a large increase in malaria cases in 2020 compared to previous years,
which was associated with delayed IRS in 2020 (50). These findings were confirmed by
national data from Zimbabwe, which compared the number of malaria cases and deaths in
2020 with those in previous years; in 2020, there was a large excess of reported malaria cases
and deaths (27, 64). Moreover, national data from Zambia showed an increase of malaria

cases between August 2019, and June 2020; however, no data from control periods were
provided (65).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has a massive impact on nearly all countries across the world.
While the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 to Africa has been slow and the COVID-19 burden
appears to be much lower than in other continents, the pandemic carries a high potential to
negatively affect the control of other diseases such as malaria (7). Both malaria and COVID19 affect disproportionally the low socio-economic classes (28, 32, 66). It is possible that the
COVID-19 pandemic and its indirect effects, including the measures to contain it, may
produce collateral damages similar to those seen six years ago during the West African Ebola
epidemic, i.e. sharp increase of malaria deaths which finally exceeded the direct Ebola
mortality (17, 35, 67). Thus, understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic affects malaria
control measures is of extreme importance for SSA (17, 59).

Accelerated malaria control efforts since the early 21st century have significantly reduced the
malaria burden in Africa and worldwide (17). Control strategies include ITN and IRS
interventions, early diagnosis and rapid treatment with ACT, and intermittent preventive
treatment for infants, children and pregnant women (14). However, the rate of reduction in
malaria morbidity and mortality in SSA has recently stalled, and the initial overall positive
trend could be seriously reversed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as shown in
several modelling studies (17, 21-23).

In accordance with our conceptual framework, four major themes likely play a major role for
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA: (1) Diagnostic and clinical aspects;
(2) Access to health care services; (3) Availability of curative and preventive malaria

commodities; and (4) Impact on malaria prevention programs. While diagnostic and clinical
aspects will play an obvious role due to the overlapping symptoms of both diseases (27, 68,
69), therapeutic aspects related to initial misperceptions regarding the efficacy of certain
antimalarials against COVID-19 may have been overemphasized (25, 35). Co-infection with
malaria may complicate COVID-19, while immunomodulation caused by previous malaria
exposure may result in less severe COVID-19, as previously also shown in other respiratory
diseases (70-73). Reduced access to health care services due to direct and indirect effects of
the pandemic has a negative impact on access to antimalarial treatment, thus it would likely
have a major effect on the malaria burden in endemic countries (17, 49, 53). This will be
compounded by the clear negative impact of the pandemic on global supply chains for
curative and preventive malaria commodities (47, 52). The consequences of the pandemic for
preventive malaria control programs have been much emphasized by many of the reviewed
papers and particularly in modeling papers. However, as an effect of such early warnings,
country programs and funding for malaria have probably adapted rapidly to the pandemic as
early as 2020, which may have reduced the modeled impact (28, 59).

Until June 2021, only a few reports provided actual epidemiological data on malaria in SSA
during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. These reports showed that the number of
reported malaria cases in highly endemic countries (e.g. Sierra Leone, Uganda, DRC) was
much lower than expected (29, 61-63), while the number of reported malaria cases in
countries of low endemicity (e.g. Zimbabwe, Zambia) was higher than in previous years (27,
29, 64, 65). Possibly lower access to health care services in combination with impaired
malaria surveillance systems may have led to a lower number of reported malaria cases and
deaths in these selected highly endemic countries, while in the two low endemic southern
SSA countries disruption of malaria control activities within relatively well-functioning health
systems, including surveillance activities, may have resulted in a higher number of reported

malaria cases and deaths. More information from other African endemic countries is needed
to fully assess such developments (59, 74). As the COVID-19 pandemic is far from being
under control in most LMICs as new and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants are
emerging, and as SSA countries have limited access to COVID-19 vaccines, dramatic
increases of the malaria burden may occur (59, 75, 76). Although the findings of existing
modeling studies are already alarming, the final impact of the pandemic on the malaria burden
could be even more devasting (21, 51). Better education, sensitization and de-stigmatization
of both diseases is essential, including emphasis on early care seeking behaviour, which needs
also more community participation (25, 29). Community health workers should be
encouraged to treat all uncomplicated malaria cases in the community and to refer to health
facilities only severe cases (51, 77). As 2020 was a year with many planned malaria
prevention campaigns, the negative effects of disrupted programs would probably last for
some years (21, 23). Fortunately, the international community, including the WHO, acted fast
to counteract such developments (17). However, there is the need for more support for SSA
countries from the international community and from high income countries (32). Malaria,
one of Africa’s deadliest diseases which disproportionally affects the most vulnerable
population groups, must be kept under control (16, 34, 59).

Conclusion
The findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but diverse impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria burden in SSA. Only results of further studies will
enable a full understanding of these developments and its public health consequences. In the
meantime, SSA countries need more support from the international community including the
urgent delivery of COVID-19 vaccines for high-risk groups.
