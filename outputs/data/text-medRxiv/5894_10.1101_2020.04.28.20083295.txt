Abstract
Background
Information on risk factors for COVID-19 is sub-optimal. We investigated demographic,
lifestyle, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors, and compared them to risk factors for
pneumonia and influenza in UK Biobank.
Methods
UK Biobank recruited 37-70 year olds in 2006-2010 from the general population. The
outcome of confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test) was linked to baseline
UK Biobank data. Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data.
Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes.
Findings
Among 428,225 participants, 340 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment,
modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index (RR 1.24 per SD increase), smoking (RR
1.38), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.66) and use of blood pressure
medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40). Non-modifiable risk factors included
older age (RR 1.10 per 5 years), male sex (RR 1.64), black ethnicity (RR 1.86), socioeconomic
deprivation (RR 1.26 per SD increase in Townsend Index), longstanding illness (RR 1.38) and
high cystatin C (RR 1.24 per 1 SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia
somewhat; less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally
stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza.
Interpretation
These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19
and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding
of high risk.

Introduction

COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, includes a spectrum of morbidity from
asymptomatic infection 1 to severe pneumonia in patients presenting for medical care 2.
The COVID-19 pandemic 3 has led to concerted research efforts to identify people at
greatest risk of developing the infection and progressing to critical illness and dying.
Predictors of disease severity include older age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, kidney
disease, COPD, and previous cardiovascular disease 4–7. In addition it is becoming clear that
other risk factors might include obesity and low physical fitness 8,9. However, many studies
investigate risk factors for disease progression to death or critical illness among hospitalised
patients7 as opposed to healthy comparators.

Identifying the risk factors for COVID-19 is important in terms of identifying factors that can
be modified to reduce risk, as well as identifying non-modifiable risk factors that can help
identify high risk groups who require shielding and targeting for testing, and eventual
vaccine and anti-viral therapies. Pneumonia is a life-threatening complication of COVID-19
infection 10. Established major risk factors for community-acquired pneumonia include many
of the emerging risk factors for COVID-19 11. As COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral
infection, it may have risk factors for contraction of the disease that are common to other
respiratory virus conditions such as Influenza.

UK Biobank is a large prospective, deeply-phenotyped, population-based cohort study
carried out in the UK 12. Over the study period, testing for COVID-19 in England was
conducted in A&E departments and in-hospital. These data were provided by Public Health
England (PHE) and linked to UK Biobank baseline data. We aimed to establish modifiable
and non-modifiable risk factors for confirmed COVID-19. We also aimed to compare these
risk factors to risk factors for the incident pneumonia over a similar time span.

Methods
UK Biobank was conducted via 22 assessment centres across England, Scotland, and Wales
between March 2006 and December 2010 and recruited 502,624 participants aged 37 to 73

years. The present study was restricted to participants living in England for whom COVID-19
test results were available. Death data were available to the end of January 2018 in England.
To reduce bias, we excluded from the study all participants known to have died COVID-19
pandemic. Baseline biological measurements were recorded and touch-screen
questionnaires were administered according to a standardised protocol. 12,13 UK Biobank
received ethical approval from the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee
(REC reference: 11/NW/03820). All participants gave written informed consent before
enrolment in the study, which was conducted in accord with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. This study was performed under UK Biobank application number
7155.

Outcomes
Results of COVID-19 tests for UK Biobank participants were provided by PHE 7. Data
provided by PHE included the specimen date, specimen type (e.g. upper respiratory tract),
laboratory, origin (whether evidence from microbiological record that the participant was
an inpatient or not) and result (positive or negative). Data were available for the period 16th
March 2020 to 14th April 2020. Results were available for 2,724 tests conducted on 1,474
individuals. Confirmed COVID-19 infection (primary outcome) was defined as at least one
positive result in the context of an in-hospital or accident and emergency (A&E) test. Any
positive test result was used as a sensitivity analysis.

Pneumonia was defined based on ICD-10 codes J12-J18, and influenza based on J09-J11,
converted into Read Codes using the UK Biobank’s look-up table. Incident pneumonia and
influenza, occurring after 1st January 2016 (an arbitrary date taken to mimic the time lag
from baseline exposure measurement to incident COVID-19 infection, while also obtaining
sufficient case numbers) was obtained from a 41% sample of participants with available
data from primary care. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using cases after 1st January
2015 and demonstrated consistent data. An analysis was also conducted exploring risk
factors for all cases of pneumonia and influenza after baseline.

Exposures were measured at the baseline assessment visit between 2006 and 2010.
Ethnicity, smoking, alcohol consumption, physician-diagnosed prevalent conditions and
medication use were self-reported. For the present analyses, ethnicity was coded as white,
south Asian, black, or mixed/other. Smoking status was categorised into never versus
former/current smoking. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured at the
baseline visit, preferentially using an automated measurement, but using manual
measurement where this was not available, and average of available measures used. Arealevel socioeconomic deprivation was assessed by the Townsend score (incorporating
measures of unemployment, non-car ownership, non-home ownership and household
overcrowding) corresponding to the participants’ home postcode. Higher scores on the
Townsend score represent greater socioeconomic deprivation. Self-reported walking pace
was rated by each participant as slow, steady/average, or brisk 14.

The definition of baseline diabetes included self-reported type 1 or type 2 diabetes, those
with a primary or secondary hospital diagnoses relating to diabetes at baseline (ICD-10
codes E10-E14.9), and those who reported using diabetes medications. Baseline
cardiovascular disease was defined as self-reported myocardial infarction, stroke, or
transient ischaemic attack. Cancer, longstanding illness, and depression were self-reported
on touchscreen questionnaire. Other previous health complaints including asthma,
rheumatoid arthritis, CKD, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sleep apnoea, COPD,
pneumonia, bronchitis (including bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and emphysema), and other
respiratory diseases (including interstitial lung disease, asbestosis, pulmonary fibrosis,
alveolitis, respiratory failure, pleurisy, pneumothorax, other respiratory condition) which
were derived from self-report at nurse interview. Some conditions did not have sufficient
numbers of cases for multivariable analysis, but univariable results are presented for
completeness. Statin (categorised to include other cholesterol lowering medications) and
blood pressure medication use were also recorded from self-report, with blood pressure
medication being used as a proxy for baseline diagnosed hypertension.

BMI is the ratio of the measured body mass in kg divided by height squared measured in
metres. Height was measured using a Seca 202 height measure. Weight and whole-body fat
mass and fat free mass were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using the Tanita BC-418 MA

body composition analyser. Socks and shoes were removed when height was measured
Grip strength was measured using a Jamar J00105 hydraulic hand dynamometer and the
mean was derived from the right and left hand values expressed in kilograms 15.

Lung function was assessed by spirometry using a Vitalograph Pneumotrac 6800 spirometer
(Vitalograph, Buckingham, UK). Participants did not perform spirometry if they answered
yes to unsure to the following: chest infection in the last month, history of detached retina,
heart attack, surgery to eyes, chest or abdomen in last 3 months, history of collapsed lung,
pregnancy, or currently on medication for tuberculosis. The aim was to record two
acceptable blows from a maximum of three attempts. The spirometer software compared
the acceptability of the first two blows and, if acceptable (defined as a ≤5% difference in FVC
and FEV1), the third blow was not required. The mean observation was taken for both
measures.

Blood collection sampling procedures for the study have been previously described and
validated.16 Biochemical assays were performed at a dedicated central laboratory on around
480,000 samples. Further details of these measurements can be found in the UK Biobank
Data Showcase and Protocol (http://www.ukbiobank. ac.uk). For the present study we
included total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, rheumatoid factor, cystatin C, glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1C), C-reactive protein (CRP), differential white blood cell count, and red
cell distribution width as exposures of interest.

Statistics
Mean and standard deviations were reported for continuous outcomes except for
biomarkers, where median and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported. Poisson regression
with robust ‘sandwich’ standard errors were used to study the associations of exposure
variables with confirmed COVID-19 and pneumonia. Poisson regressions were used because
they provide risk ratio (RR) which is easier to interpret and robust error estimation ensures
accurate inference 17. Three adjustment schemes were considered: model 0 - univariate (i.e.
no adjustment), model 1 – adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation index, and model
2 – further adjusted for behavioural (smoking and alcohol drinking) and physical (adiposity,
blood pressure, spirometry, and physical capability) factors that were found to be significant

in model 1. To avoid multicollinearity, if there were similar factors that were significant in
model 2, only the one with strongest association was chosen. This included, for example,
choosing one from, BMI, BMI categories, body fat-free mass, body fat mass, and body fat
percent, or one from FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC. For continuous variables, the linearity of
exposure-outcome associations were tested using penalised cubic splines in generalised
additive model (GAM) 18. Nonlinearity was tested using likelihood ratio test comparing a
model with the exposure fitted on a spline with a model assuming a linear exposureoutcome relationship. P-value for nonlinearity < 0.05 suggest evidence against the linearity
assumption. Spline smoothness was chosen using generalised cross validation 19. Population
attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated to determine the relative contribution of each
risk factor to the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases within UK Biobank. Another
Poisson model which included all significant factors in model 2 was fitted to estimate the
mutually adjusted RRs. These RRs were biased towards null because of over adjustment bias
but were used to construct the PAFs to ensure the PAF estimates did not overlap or exceed
100%. In general, two-tailed P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Analyses were conducted in R Statistical Software version 3.5.3 with the package “mgcv”.

Results
Of 445,857 participants in England, 428,225 were alive during the available follow-up
period. Complete data on covariates were available for 285,817 (66.7%) participants.
Primary care data on incident pneumonia were available in 117,948 (41.3%) participants
(Supplementary Fig 1). At 1st March 2020, the age range of eligible participants was 48-85
years, and time elapsed from baseline was median 10.97 years (IQR 10.36-11.55 years). Of
these participants, 898 received at least one COVID-19 test, and 400 had at least one
positive result, with 340 positive results conducted in hospital or A&E (primary outcome).

Univariable risk factors for incident COVID-19
Key univariable potentially modifiable risk factors for confirmed COVID-19 included current
and former smoking (RR 1.62), higher BMI and body fat (RR 2.29 for obesity), treated
hypertension (RR 2.07), higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and slow walking pace
as a proxy for fitness (RR 2.40) (Table 1). Among non-modifiable risk factors were older age

(particularly the over 65s at baseline, corresponding to over 75 in 2020), male sex (RR 1.56),
black ethnicity (RR 2.74), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.37 per 1 SD increase in Townsend
Index) (Table 1). COVID-19 was only weakly associated with low FEV1/FVC ratio (RR 0.90 per
1 SD increase). Among baseline comorbidities, general long standing illness (RR 1.88),
baseline diabetes (RR 2.07), baseline CVD (RR 2.19), sleep apnoea (RR 3.91), statin use (RR
1.85), higher inflammatory markers (particularly white blood cell count; RR 1.20 per 1 SD
increase), and higher cystatin C (RR 1.45 per 1 SD increase) were also associated with
confirmed COVID-19 (Table 1). Risk factor associations were similar when all 400 test
positive COVID-19 cases were considered, rather than only in-hospital positive tests
(supplementary table 1)

Univariable risk factors for incident pneumonia
Of the 117,837 participants with primary care data, 259 had pneumonia recorded after
2016. Of the modifiable risk factors pneumonia was associated with BMI and slow walking
pace, but not smoking, blood pressure or blood pressure medication use. Incident
pneumonia was more common in participants who were over 55 years at baseline, women
(RR 0.61 among men), and socioeconomically deprived participants (RR 1.37 per 1 SD
increase in Townsend Index), (Table 1). Pneumonia was also more common in those with
low grip strength, and lower FEV and FVC, and FEV/FVC ratio (Table 1). Among
comorbidities, baseline diabetes, CVD and cancer were approximately twice as common in
those who developed pneumonia (Table 1), and any longstanding illness was also strong
associated with pneumonia. Among blood biomarkers, poorer renal function as measured
by higher cystatin-C, higher HbA1C, higher CRP and white blood cell count (including
neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) and higher red cell distribution width were all
associated with pneumonia. Ethnicity was not associated with pneumonia.

When investigating risk factors for pneumonia over the full follow-up time from baseline,
risk factors were generally similar although there was increased power due to a higher
number of incident cases (Supplementary table 1). In this analysis smoking was weakly
associated with pneumonia (RR 1.17) as was blood pressure medication use (RR 1.15).
Similar findings were found when we studied pneumonia occurring after 2015
(Supplementary Table 2).

Univariable risk factors for incident influenza
Of the 117,837 participants with primary care data, 111 had influenza recorded after 2016.
Those who developed influenza were generally more socioeconomically deprived, more
likely to have bronchitis at baseline, and less likely to take statins. No other risk factors
showed strong associations (Table 1). When all influenza cases occurring after baseline were
considered, evidence of statistically significant associations became stronger due to
increased power but cases were more common in slightly younger people and in women,
and smoking, walking pace, and BMI was less strongly associated with influenza cases than
for COVID-19, and blood pressure medication was not at all associated with influenza
(Supplementary Table 1).

Multivariable models for COVID-19 and pneumonia
After multivariable adjustment for sociodemographic factors, the modifiable risk factors for
confirmed COVID-19 included smoking (RR 1.44 (95% CI 1.15-1.79)), higher BMI (RR 1.33 per
SD increase (95% CI 1.21-1.46)) and other measures of body fat, diastolic blood pressure, as
well as blood pressure medication, FEV1 and FVC (but not FEV1/FVC ratio), and slow walking
pace (RR 2.04 (95% CI 1.49-2.79)) (Table 2). Other risk factors were older age (RR 1.15 per 5
years (95% CI 1.08-1.24)), male sex (RR 1.54 (95% CI 1.24-1.91)), black ethnicity (RR 2.07
(95% CI 1.16, 3.71)), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.35 per SD increase in Townsend Index
(95% CI 1.23-1.49)). Among comorbidities, risk factors included longstanding illness (RR 1.65
(95% CI 1.32-2.06)), diabetes, CVD and statin use. Among blood biomarkers, risk factors
included lower total and HDL-cholesterol, and higher cystatin C (RR 1.36 per 1 SD increase
(95% CI 1.23-1.49)), HbA1C (RR 1.20 per 1 SD increase (95% CI 1.11-1.30)), CRP and white
blood cell count (Table 2).

After adding BMI, blood pressure, FEV1 and walking pace as covariates, modifiable risk
factors for COVID-19 admission continued to include smoking (RR 1.38 (95% CI 1.11-1.73)),
higher BMI (RR 1.24 (95% CI 1.12-1.38)), use of blood pressure lowering medication as a
proxy for hypertension (RR 1.40 95% CI 1.08-1.82) and slow walking pace (RR 1.66 (95% CI
1.20-2.30)). Other risk factors included older age (RR 1.10 per 5 year increase (95% CI 1.021.36)), male sex (RR 1.64 (95% CI 1.25-2.14)), black ethnicity (RR 1.86 (95% CI 1.03, 3.36)),

socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.26 (95% CI 1.14-1.40)), longstanding illness (RR 1.38 (95%
CI 1.09-1.74)), lower HDL-cholesterol (RR 0.82 (95% CI 1.72-0.95)) and higher cystatin C (RR
1.24 (95% CI 1.12-1.37)) (Table 2).

Nonlinear associations of continuous variables with COVID-19 and pneumonia are shown in
Figure 1 (and supplementary table 2). Age was associated with COVID-19 admission
curvilinearly, where participants aged 40-60 years shared similar risk and participants aged
over 60 years had exponentially increased risk with age. Associations were similar when
adjusting for body fat percentage rather than BMI (Supplementary Table 3).

Directly contrasting model 2 for COVID-19 and pneumonia (Figure 2), the risk factors in
common for both conditions were older age, higher BMI and slow walking pace, although
the latter two associations less strongly associated with pneumonia than for COVID-19.
Highlighting specific differences, smoking and treated blood pressure were only associated
with COVID-19. Pneumonia was more common in women, and socioeconomic deprivation
and cystatin-C were not associated with pneumonia. Low FEV1 was independently
associated with pneumonia, but not with COVID-19. Pneumonia also showed an association
with baseline cancer.

Population attributable risks
Factors that were significant in Table 2 were mutually adjusted to compare their population
attributable fractions for COVID-19 and pneumonia (Table 3). Among potentially modifiable
risk factors smoking accounted for 12.8% of COVID-19 cases that occurred within the UK
Biobank population, treated BP with 5.0% of cases, slow walking pace with 2.8%, and BMI
with 0.6% (total 21.2%). In contrast, none of these factors were large contributors to
pneumonia cases within UK Biobank. (Table 3)

Discussion
In this population-based study, we found that confirmed COVID-19 infection was associated
with a number of modifiable risk factors, a trend that less apparent for pneumonia and

influenza. In particular, the associations of smoking, BMI (and body fat), hypertension, and
physical fitness (as measured by slow walking pace) with COVID-19 are of note; even when
such factors were measured a decade before infection they potentially accounted for onefifth of UK Biobank confirmed COVID-19 cases. The other independent risk factors for
COVID-19 infection included older age, male sex, black ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation,
longstanding illness, and reduced renal function as measured by cystatin C, the latter also
notable given renal complication in severe COVID-19.

It is importance to recognise the competing risk for health of lockdown and social
distancing. Social distancing reduces viral transmission, but also has consequences for
lifestyle. Previous data suggests that physical fitness can be rapidly lost when activity levels
decrease 20,21, and this will also result in an increase in BMI 22,23. Further, social distancing
may increase loneliness, depression, and psychological stress in some people and
consequently adversely affect eating habits 24 and other health behaviours. Anecdotal
evidence from our clinics and media suggest many are struggling with overeating. This study
strongly suggests public health guidance should focus on reducing the risk of severe
complications of COVID-19 by advocating a healthy lifestyle during the ongoing pandemic,
not just for general cardiovascular and metabolic health, but also to help to protect against
COVID-19 infection, used alongside other public health interventions.

Understanding the actual causes of disease, rather than markers that simply correlate with
exposures, is clearly a key issue to consider. The independent association of socioeconomic
deprivation with COVID-19 after multiple adjustment may be explained by the accumulation
of earlier life socioeconomic adversities which can result in less physiological reserve and
more multimorbidity 24,25. It may also be linked to more overcrowding, reduced social
distancing, and potential exposure to greater viral load. Asthma, diabetes and high blood
pressure, which have been shown to be associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19
outcomes 26 also showed some trends to be associated with COVID-19 in this dataset. While
substantial focus of COVID-19 research has been its apparently more aggressive symptoms
and disease progression in older people, it is important to recognise that people who are
older have less cardiorespiratory reserve to cope with COVID-19 infection. Older age is also

associated with more hypertension and diabetes, poorer lung function, and greater relative
fat mass 24.

Previous reports have suggested that obesity or excess ectopic fat deposition may be a
unifying risk factor for severe Covid-19 infection 27,28, reducing both protective
cardiorespiratory reserve as well as potentiating the immune dysregulation that appears, at
least in part, to mediate the progression to critical illness in a proportion of COVID-19
patients. Our analysis bears out these hypotheses. Once BMI or body fat was adjusted for,
inflammatory markers were no longer associated with incident COVID-19. This suggests
proinflammatory markers, arising from increased adipose deposition, are probably acting as
a marker for body fat which seems to be an adverse risk factor for severe COVID-19 27–30.
Furthermore, obesity enhances thrombosis 31, which is relevant given the association
between severe COVID-19 and pro-thrombotic disseminated intravascular coagulation and
high rates of venous thromboembolism 32,33, as well as the association with D-dimer seen in
other reports 34. D-dimer was not measured in blood samples in UK Biobank.

Given that pneumonia is a critical clinical complication of COVID-19, it is important to
understand how risk factors for COVID-19 related pneumonia differ from “classic”
community acquired pneumonia 11. Our comparison between other common respiratory
diseases and COVID-19 suggests that identification of at-risk groups based on our
understanding of other respiratory diseases may be inadequate – a more refined approach
to risk stratification based on COVID-19 specific risks is needed, and future data should focus
on some of the exposures we identify to achieve this.

The strengths of our study include the large cohort size at an age relevant to more severe
COVID-19 symptoms, and biochemistry assays performed in a single dedicated central
laboratory. We were also able to extensively explore emerging and novel risk factors for
COVID-19, while simultaneously comparing to risk factors for pneumonia identified to
primary care providers. Limitations include that UK Biobank is not representative of the
whole UK population,35 (our data focuses on England specifically) although this is generally
not a concern in investigating risk associations36. Care should be taken in generalising the
PAF estimates. These related to cases occurring within the UK Biobank population, but are

not directly applicable to the general population where the prevalence of risk factors is
different. However, they allowed a direct comparison between COVID-19 and pneumonia in
the same cohort. Due to the under-representation of non-white ethnicities in UK Biobank,
we have limited power to explore important interactions by ethnic group (although Black
ethnicity was associated with the outcome), and we recognise this as an important risk
factor. Ascertainment bias, including differential healthcare seeking, differential testing and
differential prognosis may explain some differences in outcomes given poor coverage of
testing in the UK. It is also likely that cases will generally be at the more severe end of the
clinical spectrum by using hospitalised cases as the outcome, although use of admission to
ITU would be additionally informative once sufficient case numbers accrue. Despite this, we
still observe many similar risk factors to incident pneumonia, which is more likely to have
close to complete case ascertainment in primary care records, although, as discussed, other
risk factors seem more strongly linked to COVID-19 infections. Exposures were measured
several years before the development of the outcomes, and misclassification of the
exposures will likely bias our results to the null. However, this also serves to illustrate that
the risk factors were generally present many years before development of the disease, and
as is well known, risk factors tend to track with age. We have also been unable to fully
exclude all deaths that occurred prior to the pandemic, due to lack of up-to-date linkage to
mortality records.

In conclusion, these early data from UK Biobank suggest risk factors for confirmed COVID-19
infection differ in some important ways from risk factors for pneumonia, being more
common in males than females, in lower SES, and with stronger associations with ethnicity,
CV risk markers, prior smoking and adiposity. Such findings suggest possible merit in
advocating improvements in lifestyle as an additional measure to reduce the risk of COVID19 alongside existing public health measures such as social distancing and shielding of high
risk groups. have implications for health advice targeted at the public to lessen risks during
this pandemic

Data presented as risk ratios and their 95% CI. continuous exposures were standardised and presented as 1-standar deviation increment. Variables with
associations denoted “-“ are excluded from the model due to non-significance in previous model and /or collinearity with another variable. Analyses were
adjusted for Model 1 (age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation) and model 2 (model 1 plus BMI, FEV1, and walking pace (and also DBP for COVID-19 only))

Figure 2. Risk factors for COVID-19 and Pneumonia in the UK Biobank cohort.

Data presented as Risk Ratios (RR) and their 95% CI. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, BMI, FEV1, and walking pace (and DBP for
COVID-19 only). Continuous exposures were standardised and presented 1-SD increment (deprivation index SD=3.01, Cystatin C SD=0.14, BMI SD=4.59,
HbA1c SD=5.80, white cell count SD=1.69, FEV1 SD=0.77 and HDL cholesterol SD=0.37).
