COVID-19 higher morbidity and mortality in Chinese regions with
lower air quality
Short summary
• There is a significant correlation between air pollution and COVID-19 spread and mortality in China.
• The correlation stands at a second-order administration level, after controlling for varying population
densities and removing Wuhan and Hubei from the dataset.
• Living in an area with low air quality is a risk factor for becoming infected and dying from this new
form of coronavirus.
Abstract - We investigated the geographical character of the COVID-19 infection in China and
correlated it with satellite- and ground-based measurements of air quality. Controlling for population
size, we found more viral infections in those areas afflicted by high Carbon Monoxide, formaldehyde,
PM 2.5, and Nitrogen Dioxide values. Higher mortality was also correlated with relatively poor air
quality. Air pollution appears to be a risk factor for the incidence of this disease, similar to smoking.
This suggests the detrimental impact of air pollution in these types of respiratory epidemics.
Keywords: air pollution; SARS-CoV-2; risk factors; virulence; climate change.
To the Editor:
COVID-19, initially detected in China and
rapidly spread to the rest of the world, has
ignited a pandemic at an exorbitant human
cost. In a span of just over three months,
eastern and western doctors, biologists, and
sociologists alike have turned their attention
at disentangling the aetiology of this disease.
Various risk factors have been implicated with
the fast spread of the virus, assuming
different characters whether considered
within or between countries. On an individual
level, an older age, the male gender and
smoking status have all been shown to
increase the virulence of SARS-CoV-2.
From the standpoint of the natural
sciences and evolution, we can take a
broader perspective beyond virological and
medical mechanisms to appreciate how a
coronavirus transmitted once more from an
animal species to us. Elements including
human
and
livestock
overpopulation,
biodiversity loss and climate change played a
critical role in making the ground suitable for
a new epidemics to flourish1.
Pertaining to climate change, air pollution
is notoriously known to cause health
problems and, in particular, viral respiratory
infections and pneumonia to individuals
exposed for several days a year2.
From our perspective as biologists,
economists and geographers, we have
investigated the expansion of the infection in
China (with Hong Kong and Taiwan included
– data from the Chinese government health
commission) and we have correlated it with

the
annual
tropospheric
column
measurements of several air pollutants
sampled from the Sentinel-5 satellite time
series (data from the European Space
Agency portal) as well as data derived from
traditional air quality stations. The data were
updated on 23 May 2020, well after the first,
main infection wave and they include the
major 17 April update (at the time, an increase
of 1,290 casualties, about 50% from the
previous figure, and an increase of 325
infections for the city of Wuhan only). See
Table 1 S.I. for a comprehensive summary of
the data and the sources.
Controlling for varying population sizes, we
find more viral infections and fatalities in those
Chinese prefectures afflicted by common
pollutants of the air: CO, HCHO, PM 2.5, PM
10, and NO2. This trend holds also after
removing (1) Wuhan city and (2) the whole
Hubei province from the dataset in
succession (see Table 4 S.I. and 5 S.I.). All
correlation tests were performed using
Kendall’s Tau with the significance threshold
set to 0.05.
Aerosol data from the satellite, which
include PM 2.5 and PM 10, were not
associated with higher mortality. This is not
surprising, they in fact comprise nonpollutant, inert particulates such as dust, sand
and sea salt. On the other hand, statistics
suggested that higher levels of O3 and SO2
were not associated with more COVID-19
deaths, which goes against the trends of the
other pollutants, an aspect that requires
further investigation. A comprehensive

statistical output is reported in Table 1.
Despite the fact the SARS-CoV-2 was first
detected in Wuhan and that the first location
of the pathogen assumes a key role in the
geographical spread of the infection, the
detrimental effect that air pollution assumes
at a national level remains evident. Although
the measures to contain the virus taken by the
Chinese government were effective when
compared to other countries affected by what
later became a pandemic, the strong
association between air pollution and higher
morbidity and mortality rates can be detected
even where the series of outbreaks originated
from.
Even if free health care was dispensed to
everyone in the exceptional case of this
epidemics, the Chinese health system, as
those ones of many other countries, is not
adequate at planning for global health
according to these risk factors3. We
hypothesise that the correlational significance
we have found points towards air pollution as
a critical risk cofactor for COVID-19, also
because of other studies. (1) Testing the more
proximal
hypothesis
that
COVID-19
outbreaks could follow with a temporal delay
from days with high NO2 presence in the air,
colleagues in Shanghai are publishing
detailed time series suggesting a delay of 12
days before hospitalisations for the Hubei
province4. This may even suggest the role of
air pollutants as airborne vectors for this virus,
later also suggested by another study5 run in
three cities in Hubei province. At a Chinese
national level, PM 2.5 and NO2 pollution from
ground stations was recently found correlated
with this pathology incidence, after adjusting
for some socio-economic factors and human
movements following the Spring festival6. (2)
In the United States, chronic exposure to high
levels of PM 2.5 have been found co-

responsible for a higher mortality rate from
respiratory diseases, specifically in 2020, that
is in the presence of COVID-197. This is a rate
higher than 11 other American demographic
co-variables. (3) In Italy, a similar positive
correlation controlling for five demographic
variables was also reported8, with the
additional and novel evidence that fragments
of the RNA from this virus were found in the
particulate matter of the harshly hit northern
Italian city of Bergamo9, laying in the most
polluted European area of the Po valley. (4)
Finally, our comprehensive study including
eight countries assessed with a similar
analysis, confirms this same trend in seven
additional countries to China (Italy, United
States, Iran, Spain, France, Germany, U.K.).
As a clear and immediate action to prevent
the trajectory of this and future epidemics,
curbing climate change10 must be endorsed
way more seriously. With no exceptions, it
must be endorsed now. Will the smallest of
the parasites be able to wake us up this time,
so that we start caring about the health of the
environment as much as we have been caring
about our own and public health?
