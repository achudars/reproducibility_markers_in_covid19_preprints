Abstract
The coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is defining a global health crisis, which is the hugest
challenge the world has faced since World War II. Accordingly, the global economy as well is
facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is
similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the
Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many
measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after
imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of
coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL)
forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and/or evaluating countermeasures. The
aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction
models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to
analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility
Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some
recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible.
The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on
November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be
5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the
predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms
need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by
the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or

system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can
shift, yet that depends on people's actions.

1. Introduction
Since the mid of December 2019, the novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2
“SARS-CoV-2”) from Wuhan, China, has continued to spread across the globe and turned into a
pandemic currently known as Covid-19 (Yousaf, et al., 2020; Kumar, et al., 2020). Because of the
rapid increase of the number of infections worldwide and the absence of vaccines, the contagious
disease has turned the world upside down. In fact, as of 15 August 2020, Coronavirus has infected
21.63 million persons, and killed more than 769 thousand people with 3.56% death to infection
rate. On the other hand, 14.34 million have been recovered with 66.31% recovery rate as of the
same date. A month later on 16 September, the virus has infected 29.73 million individuals and
the death toll reached 939,289 resulting in a mortality rate of 3.16%. Additionally, on the same
date the number of recovered people has reached 21.54 million, so that the recovery rate increased
to 72.46%. That is to say, the virus may have become less lethal globally as the death rate has
decreased by 0.5% and the recovery rate has risen by 6.15%. To add more, due to the Covid-19
pandemic, everything has been impacted around the world. In order to prevent further
transmission, strong preventive measures had been taken such as implementing lockdown and
international travel bans. Despite being under lockdown for a long time of uncertainty, things are
slowly easing back leading to a decision of reopening economies and relaxing movement
restrictions to avoid poverty increase and job losses.
Indeed, the global economy is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great
Depression (Breisinger, et al., 2020). The case in Egypt is not different from the rest of the world.
Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses, the Egyptian government has reacted
early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to
contain the spread of the virus, including travel bans, a nighttime curfew, social gatherings ban,
and the closure of some organizations, religious institutions and schools. More than three months
after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread
of coronavirus.
Due to the fact that decisions made now and in the months to come will be some of the most
important in addition to the fears of a possible powerful second wave, it is urgent that the
government making those decisions has access to the best information available regarding the
possible trajectory of the pandemic. Therefore, predictions on the potential spread of Covid-19
based on econometrics models can be important tools for designing and/or evaluating
countermeasures. In the last few months, researchers have developed or utilized existing statistical
methods to predict the number of cases and deaths (Yousaf, et al., 2020). Additionally, the released
Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) offers a novel opportunity to investigate the
relationship between mobility patterns and spread or transmission of Covid-19 (Paez, 2020).
Consequently, the aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find

the best prediction models for cases and death in Egypt and forecast them. Due to the fact of the
dynamic nature of the pandemic, more and continuous epidemiological models are needed for
forecasting. Second, to analyze the impact of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using
GCMR to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some
recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible.

2. Literature Review
Despite the importance of forecasting the possible trajectory of the pandemic, as far as we know,
the studies conducting predictions of cases and deaths in Egypt are still parsimonious and not
timely updated to reflect the most recent situation. Saba and Elsheikh (2020) forecasted the
possible number of cases in Egypt using statistical and artificial intelligence methods namely; Auto
Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Nonlinear Autoregressive Artificial Neural
Networks. The study utilized the reported cases from 1 March to 9 May 2020 to forecast one month
ahead until 8 June 2020. An increase of 280% in cases was estimated during May 2020. Similarly,
El-Ghitany (2020) conducted a short-term prediction for the epidemic situation in Egypt based on
data from February 14 until April 18, 2020. The researcher applied the exponential growth rate
model to forecast the daily cases from 19 April to 6 June. The results implicated that by late May,
infections are expected to reach more than 20,000 then starts to decline. In their study,
Elmousalami and Hassanien (2020) provided daily forecasting models of Covid-19 cases by means
of different time series models such as moving average (MA), weighted moving average, and
single exponential smoothing. The results forecasted that the number of confirmed cases in Egypt
would be doubled up to 4-folds in April. That is, they suggested that the number of coronavirus
cases grows exponentially in Egypt.
Additionally, Anwar and AbdelHafez (2020) foreseen the expectant timing of coronavirus peak in
Egypt. They employed the epidemic online calculator tool, which apply the Susceptible, Exposed,
Infective and Removed model. In their study, the daily reports for the period 14 February to 11 May
2020 was utilized. The results indicated the number of hospitalized cases is predicted to reach a
peak of 20,126 in the middle of June. While, a total of 12,303 deaths was expected. The research
also claimed that the quarantine restrictions should be kept until the end of June 2020. Likewise,
Tachy Health team applied a three-compartmental Susceptible- Infected-Recovered/Removed
time-dependent epidemiological model, to examine the epidemic curve in four Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) countries namely; Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria. For Egypt, the
results anticipated a probable peak 6 June 2020 assuming that 5% of the population is susceptible,
reproduction number of 2.6 and a 1/14 recovery rate. Another two scenarios were to reach the
highest number of infections at 18 June or 16 July based on different assumptions. However, no
studies was found that made use of GCMR in Egypt.

3. Descriptive Analysis
This section provides real-time actual data about the confirmed cases and death of Covid-19 in
Egypt since the outbreak of the virus on mid-February 2020 until mid-September 2020. In addition,
a track of Egyptians mobility and infections is presented.

3.1 Cases and Deaths Trends
As depicted by Figure 1, on August 15, 2020, the total number of confirmed infections nationwide
in Egypt reached 96,336 since the detection of the first one on 14 February. One month later, the
number of infections has risen to 101,009. Further, the death toll has been raised to 5,141 and
5,648 deaths on 15 August and 16 September 2020 respectively. On the other hand, the recovered
cases has increased to 58,835 individuals on August 15 and has reached 85,745 on 16 September.
Therefore, the infection rate was 0.09% (Population =102,334,404) until mid-August, the recovery
rate was 61.07% and the mortality rate was 5.34%. At that time, in comparison to the global values,
the recovery rate in Egypt was lower than its global counterpart by 5.24%. While, the mortality
rate was 1.78% higher in Egypt. During the last month, the infection rate in Egypt has increased
by 0.29% whilst the death rate has fallen by 0.27% and the recovery rate has increased by 23.54%.

Moreover, the daily cases started to fall since July 24, 2020. In addition, the highest numbers of
infections were 1,774 on 20 June 2020. Speaking of the number of death, it reached a maximum
of 97 deaths on June 16, 2020. It is worth mentioning that, the number of deaths has been
decreasing from 18 July 2020.

3.2 Mobility Trends
Obviously Egypt has experienced a long list of closures and policies aimed at encouraging citizens
to stay at home. Consequently, the levels of mobility changed starting from 12 March 2020 when
the government started imposing some restrictions such as schools and universities closing. At that
time, the reported cases were 7 solely. Following, a night-time curfew has been imposed since
March 24, 2020. Additionally, the Ministry of Awqaf [Endowment] declared the closure of the
mosques and the places of worship nationwide until further notice. Figure 3 depicts how mobility
to diferent destinations has altered in terms of percentage change from baseline.

Clearly, the hike in the amount of individuals going out mirrors a spike in the amount of persons
who have reportedly tested positive for the disease. Accordingly, the crowding that has occurred
over the two weeks preceding the holy month of Ramadan has lead the curve of the infection to
grow. It is worth mentioning that, right before the holy month, Egyptians were supposed to
celebrate the Easter holiday on 20 April. However, amid fears of coronavirus outbreak, complete
closure of public gardens and beaches was directed. Figure 3 shows clearly the huge recession in
mobility on that day. Importantly, this day witnessed the biggest drop in the number of people
going out. Visits to retail and recreation venues, parks, transit stations and workplaces were down
76%, 63%, 82% and 66% respectively. Afterwards, on 29 May 2020, the number of cases
surpassed the 1,000 mark; this was due to the increased mobility of the Egyptians before and during
Eid Al-Fitr.
As mentioned earlier, the highest number of infections taken place at the second half of June.
Notably, ten days prior to this latter date, movement to retail and recreational outlets and parks
was 2% and 6% higher on average than its counterpart was at the first weeks of June. At the same
time, the number of people staying home has dropped. Foundationally, visits to grocery shops and
pharmacies started to increase starting from the beginning of June marking a possible reason that
individuals embarked on applying self-isolation at homes following the Egyptian Health Minister
Treatment protocol.
Later and after about a three-month closure, by the end of June the government started reopening.
After that, individuals started spending more time out and as a result time spent at home dropped
by 5%. On the other hand, hanging to restaurants, cafes and other places increased 20% on average
during July than June. Likewise, the portion of individuals visiting parks raised by 25% on average
for the same period. At the same time, grocery stores and pharmacies witnessed 16% increase in
visits. Additionally, use of transportation hubs jumped 18% on average. Despite resulting in
upward movement as well as having Eid Al-Adha holiday, the number of infections kept on
decreasing since Mid-July. This may be because an increasing number of Egyptians are taking
social distancing measures seriously and committing to adhering to preventive measures to limit
coronavirus outbreak as a result of increased level of awareness.

4. Methodology
Modeling and forecasting daily number of cases and deaths can help the health system provide
services for the infected individuals and provide an insight for policy makers to design protective
measures. Consequently, the econometric models could be of help in forecasting trajectories of the
pandemic. In this study, both ARIMA model and ARDL model are employed to predict dailyconfirmed cases and deaths of Covid-19.

4.1 Data
Speaking of the utilized data, a total number of 192 days (from March 2, 2020 to September 8,
2020) were used to develop the ARIMA and ARDL models of new cases and deaths. The Egyptian
Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) reports the official data regarding Covid-19 on a daily
basis for instance, daily-confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths, as well as the total figures.
In 2020, Google released GCMR for many countries including Egypt. These reports aim to give
vision about the changes in response to the different policies aimed at alleviating Covid-19
consequences. The reports provide mobility alternations over time across different sets of places
such as; retail and recreation covering visits to restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, museums,
libraries and movie theaters, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations including subway
stops and bus and train stations, workplaces, and residential places with respect to a baseline
(Google LLC).
In other words, the dataset highlights the percent change in visits to different categories of places.
It depicts how the frequency and/or length of visits to categorized places change compared to
baseline days. The baseline day corresponds to the median value from the 5-week period Jan 3 –
Feb 6, 2020 (Ibid). Using this data one can assess the effect of mobility patterns on the spread of
Covid-19.
According to Lauer, et al. (2020), the median incubation duration is 5.1 days (95% Confidence
Interval (CI), 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms will do so within
11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. As a result, it is to be expected that any changes in
mobility will have a lagged effect on detecting the new infections. Consequently, lagged values of
the mobility elements and indicators are estimated by means of time series models.

4.2 Models’ Estimation
Number of new cases (NCases) and new deaths (NDeaths) on daily basis are used in the estimation
as dependent variables in two different models to be forecasted over two months (9 September - 7
November). Additionally, six independent variables – represent mobility alternations - are
included in the econometric model of daily cases while one – new infections - is used for the deaths
model.

4.2.1 Estimation of Time Series Models
Many researchers have utilized ARIMA model to forecast the infection horizon of the virus in
different countries (Dehesh, et al., 2020; Yousaf, et al., 2020; Kumar, et al., 2020; Benvenuto, et

al., 2020; Saba & Elsheikh, 2020). Popularly known as the Box–Jenkins (BJ) methodology, the
ARIMA methodology emphasizes on analyzing the probabilistic, or stochastic, properties of time
series on their own under the philosophy let the data speak for themselves (Gujarati & Porter,
2009). Unlike the regression models, in which 𝑌𝑡 is explained by k regressors 𝑋1 , 𝑋2 , … . , 𝑋𝑘 , the
BJ-type time series models allow 𝑌𝑡 to be explained by past, or lagged, values of 𝑌 itself and
stochastic error terms. The important point to note is that, the time series data used in ARIMA
should have stationary and linear nature. Hence, a stationarity test is conducted: for instance,
Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Correlogram, or the unit root test using the Augmented Dickey–
Fuller (ADF) Test or the Phillips Perron Test.
The ARIMA (p,d,q) model includes an autoregressive (AR) model and a MA model where p
denotes the number of autoregressive terms, d the number of times the series has to be differenced
before it becomes stationary, and q the number of moving average terms. The chief tools in
identifying the parameters of the model are the ACF, the Partial Autocorrelation function (PACF)
and the resulting correlograms. Having chosen a particular ARIMA model, and having estimated
its parameters, the next step is checking whether the chosen model fits the data reasonably well.
All the models that passes the residual tests should be compared using Akaike information criterion
(AIC). The model which has the least AIC is selected as the best model. Afterwards, the forecasting
step based on the previously best-fit model is carried out.

4.2.2 Estimation of Econometric Models
Until the beginning of the 1990s, static regression dominated the literature. It assumed that all the
variables in the model are stationary. It has been proved that the macroeconomic data are mostly
non-stationary; therefore, the OLS estimator does not produce reliable estimates and the regression
tends to be spurious. Researchers use differenced variables in the model to obtain stationary
variables, but in this case important information related to the long-run analysis is lost.
The co-integration approach is very attractive since it retains the long-run relations and obtains
highly consistent parameters in the long run (Stock, 1987). However, there are integration and cointegration restrictions that the models have to overcome in order to apply this approach. Firstly,
the ADF test (Dickey & Fuller, 1979) is used to examine the stationarity status of the variables in
the different models. Pesaran, et al. (2001) proposed the ARDL approach of co-integration which
can be applied and yields consistent estimates of the long-run parameters irrespective of whether
the underlying variables are I(0), or I(1), or a combination of them. In addition, the ARDL
approach permits different number of lags for each regressor to capture the data generation process
in a general to specific framework (Feridun, 2009). The Monte Carlo results indicate that the
ARDL approach works properly even when the model has endogenous regressors; the standard
errors of the estimated coefficients are standard normal, therefore the standard critical values can
be used and the diagnostic tests can be performed to evaluate the statistical performance of the
models (Song, et al., 2009).
The ARDL approach involves several steps. First, the optimal number of lags for all level variables
is selected, using the appropriate information criteria, mainly the AIC and Schwartz Information
Criterion (SIC). The second step is the bounds test, which involves estimating the Conditional

Unrestricted Error Correction Model (UECM) to test for the existence of a long-run steady state
relationship between the dependent variable and all the explanatory variables. Then, we can

where p, q, m, n, s, v, u are the optimal lags of level of the regressors: LnNCasest-i, Groceryt,
Parkst, Recreationt, Resedentialt, Transitt, and Workplacest respectively, ∆ is the first difference
operator, and σ0 is a drift component. The left hand side of Equation (1) is the natural log of new
cases (LnNCasest). The right hand side of the equation represents the explanatory variables in one
lag in level, and in differences with the optimal lags for each variable; the independent variables
represent six different measures of mobility alternations over time across different sets of places
in Egypt. The parameters σsi correspond to the short-run relations, whereas 𝜌 and θs correspond
to the long-run relations; ϵt is random errors.
The Wald or F-statistic is used to test the joint significance of lagged levels of the variables in the
UECM, and determine the existence of the long-run equilibrium under the null hypothesis of no
co-integration (H0 : 𝜌 = θ1 = θ2 = θ3 = θ4 = θ5 = θ6 = 0) against the alternative that a
long-run relation exists (H1 : ρ ≠ θ1 ≠ θ2 ≠ θ3 ≠ θ4 ≠ θ5 ≠ θ6 ≠ 0) in Equation (1). However,
as discussed by Pesaran, et al. (2001), both statistics have no standard distribution, irrespective of
whether the regressors are purely I(0), purely I(1) or mutually co-integrated. Therefore, Pesaran,
et al. (2001) computed two types of asymptotic critical values for a given significance level in the
case of including and excluding trend. The first type assumes that all the variables are I(1), and the
other assumes that all the variables are I(0). If the computed Wald or F-statistics exceed the upper
critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected and the underlying variables are co-integrated. If the
Wald or F-statistics are below the lower critical value, the null cannot be rejected and the variables
are not co-integrated. Finally, if the Wald or F-statistic values lies between the two bounds, the
test is inconclusive.
Once a long-run relationship has been established by the bounds test, the long-run relations can be
estimated as 𝛽𝑗 =

−𝜃𝑗
𝜌

. Since j represents the independent variables in Equation (1), 𝛽𝑗𝑠 are the

long-run coefficients of the different independent variables in the equation.
Finally, the models have to undergo several statistical checking such as autocorrelation,
heteroscedasticity and stability test in order to ascertain their statistical reliability to be used in
forecasting.

4.3 Forecasting Procedures
4.3.1 Ex-Post Forecasting Procedures
An ex-post forecast (after the event forecast) is a forecast that is run in past periods for which
actual values of the new cases and new deaths, in addition to the explanatory variables are
available. The comparison of ex-post forecasts between different methods of estimation allows
researchers to decide which method generates the best forecast, and therefore it can be used to
produce ex-ante (before the event) forecasts (Nosier, 2012). Ex-post forecasting in the present
study aims to evaluate the forecasting performance of the ARDL co-integration estimates and
ARIMA (p d q) estimates for comparison.
The ARDL and ARIMA methods are re-estimated for the new cases and new deaths of Covid-19
models using daily data for the period from 2nd of March to 25th of August 2020. The estimated
parameters are used to generate dynamic, ex-post forecasting over 14 days for the period (26th of
August – 8th of September 2020) for the two estimated models. Dynamic forecasting calculates
dynamic, multi-step forecasts starting from the first period in the forecast sample. In dynamic
forecasting, previously forecasted values for the lagged dependent variables are used in generating
forecasts of the current value. This choice will be available for our models, since the estimated
equation contains dynamic components, such as lagged dependent variables and ARIMA terms.
The appropriate method of forecasting is chosen as the method, which has the least forecasting
errors according to the forecasting error criteria, such as Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), Mean
Absolute Errors (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) and Symmetric Mean
Absolute Percentage Errors (SMAPE).
Forecasting errors are defined as the differences between the actual and forecasted value over the
period of the forecasting horizon, which are defined as:
et = LnNCasest − LnNCasesFt … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … . . … . (2)
where LnNCasest is the actual value of the natural log of new cases in time t, LnNCasesFt is the
forecasted value of the natural log of new cases in time t, 𝑒𝑡 is the forecasting errors in time t. In
theory, for a well specified model, it is expected that the forecasting error has a mean of zero over
a certain forecasting horizon. However, very small forecasting errors can be obtained even if the
models are not well specified as a result of the existence of positive and negative forecasting error
values, which cancel each other out. To solve this problem, measures of forecasting errors accuracy
have been improved and the errors of Equation (2) transformed either to squared values (𝑒𝑡2 ) as in
the RMSE in Equation (3), or to absolute values |𝑒𝑡 | as in the MAE in Equation (4) (Song, et al.,
2009).

where n is the number of forecasts. The main difference between the two forecasting error
measures is that the MAE gives equal weight to all errors, whereas the RMSE gives more weight
to larger errors. Therefore, the RMSE is more sensitive to one extremely bad forecast (Li, et al.,
2005). The MAPE is another error forecast measure in which the errors of the forecast are divided
by the actual values of the dependent value, as in Equation (5), to produce unit independent
measures (percentage errors), so one can compare the errors of fitted models that differ in level.

In the present study, the three measures are used to compare forecasting accuracy between different
methods for the same model, whereas the MAPE is used to compare forecasting accuracy even
across the two models. Moreover, Lewis (1982) suggested the following interpretation of the
resulting MAPE values: Less than 10% is highly accurate forecasts, 10%-20% is a good
forecasting, 20%-25% is a reasonable forecasting, 50% or more is an inaccurate forecasting (Lewis
1982, quoted in Tideswell, et al., 2001).

4.3.2 Ex-Ante Forecasting Procedures
Ex-ante forecasting is very important for decision-making for both the private and public sectors.
Generating accurate and valid forecasts requires well specified, theoretically consistent and
statistically robust econometric methods (Nosier, 2012).
Statistical diagnostics and stability tests should be performed to examine the validity of the
estimated ARIMA and ARDL in forecasting the future new cases and deaths of Covid-19 in Egypt.
Moreover, ex-post forecasting comparison is implemented to select the preferred method for each
model. The picked best-fit models are utilized to forecast daily cases and deaths for 60 days using
the whole time span of 192 days. A longer forecast horizon would result in increasing errors of the
forecast variables, resulting in lack of robustness and accuracy of the econometric forecast (Lee,
2005).

5. Results
In this section, the results of the estimated ARIMA and ARDL models are presented and discussed.
Diagnostic tests are performed to the resulting estimates. If the used methods overcome the
diagnostic and stability tests, we proceed by using the fitted models in generating ex-post and exante forecasting of daily cases and deaths in Egypt over a period of two months from the 9th of
September to the 7th of November as stated before.

5.1 Estimation Results
5.1.1 Results of Time Series Models - ARIMA
ARIMA (4, 2, 1) is selected - according to the AIC- as the most appropriate specification to
forecast the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Egypt, as illustrated in Figure 4 (A). The model
as a whole is significant at the 1% level of significance and it has moderate explanatory power
(R2= 0.613). The residuals of the model have no first order autocorrelation according to DW

statistic (1.67), but the residuals are heteroscedastic (F-statistic of Autoregressive Conditional test
of heteroscedasticity (ARCH) = 24.47, p-value = 0.000). The model is stable according to the
Regression Equation Specification Error Test (RESET) (F-statistic = 0.551, p-value = 0.459).
Therefore, except for heteroscedasticity, the ARIMA model has no econometric problems.
In addition, ARIMA (1, 1, 4) is used to forecast the number of new deaths, as it is proved to have
the best specification using the AIC, as shown by Figure 4 (B). The model is significant at the 1%
level of significance, however, it has weak explanatory power (R2= 0.29). The residuals have no
first order autocorrelation according to DW statistic (2.05). However, using ARCH test, the
residuals are heteroscedastic (F-statistic = 8.514, p-value=0.004). Finally, the model is stable (Fstatistic of RESET test=0.391, p-value=0.533). Therefore, the ARIMA model has no econometric
problems, except for heteroscedasticity.
Solving for the problem of heteroscedasticity in the two models; ARIMA-ARCH model is utilized
to obtain homoscedastic residuals. Both ARIMA and ARIMA-ARCH models are utilized in the
ex-post forecasting to choose the highest forecasting accuracy models, which have the lowest
forecasting errors.

5.1.2 Results of the Econometric Models - ARDL
5.1.2.1 Unit Root Results
The results of the ADF unit root tests are reported in Table 1. At the 5% level of significance, the
results indicate that LnNCasest is non-stationary, but stationary in first differences, I(1) variables,
according to the appropriate trend-specification. All the other variables in the two models are found
to be stationary variables, I(0). However, we proceed by estimating the co-integration relation of
the two models, since we use the ARDL technique which permits a co-integration relationship to
exist irrespective of whether variables have the same integrating order or not.

5.1.2.2 Bounds Test Results
The first step in ARDL approach of co-integration is to determine the optimal lags of the variables
included in the models. Ten lags are set as a maximum lag length, and different ARDL
specifications are chosen separately for each model and each variable according to the AIC as
illustrated in Figure 5. Therefore; ARDL (10, 3, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1) has been selected as the best-fit model
to forecast daily new cases, while, ARDL (9, 0) has been preferred for predicting daily new deaths.

The second step of ARDL approach is to test the existence of the long-run Equilibrium relationship
–co-integration relationship– between LnNCases and its determinants in the first model, and
between LnNDeaths and its determinants in the second model using the bound test. The results of
bounds tests (computed F-statistics) for the two models are presented in Table 2.
The null hypothesis of no co-integration is rejected in the two models, indicating that there is a cointegration relation at the 1% level of significance for the two models over the period of the study.
Therefore, we can proceed by estimating the long-run relationships between these variables.

5.1.2.3 Estimating the Long-Run Equilibrium Relationships
Having determined the best ARDL specification for the two models and the long-run cointegration relation is detected, long-run steady-state parameters were estimated and examined
statistically in the two models as illustrated in Table 3.
The models perform reasonably. The adjusted R2 is very strong in both models, indicating strong
explanatory power and the diagnostic tests indicate no statistical problems, except for
heteroscedasticity in the new deaths’ model. White-Hinkley (HC1) heteroscedasticity consistent
standard errors and covariance is used to control the problem of heteroscedasticity in this model.
Moreover, the two models are stable. Therefore, forecasting using these models can be performed
accurately.
For the cases’ model, all the long-run coefficients are significant at the 1% level of significance but the residential variable is not significant - indicating that mobility of population is affecting
the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. As expected, a
1% increase in visits to grocery and pharmacy places, recreation areas, and workplaces compared
with the base line is associated with higher incidence of Covid-19 by 14%, 30%, and 21%
respectively at the 1% level of significance. However, the long-run coefficients of parks and transit
have an unexpected negative sign. In the deaths’ model, an increase in new cases by 1% tends to
increase the new deaths by 0.72% on average in the long run.
Therefore, the spread of Covid-19 is caused by increasing mobility, especially to recreation areas
-such as restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries and movie theaters-

5.2 Forecasting Results
5.2.1 Ex-Post Forecasting Results
Speaking of the daily new cases, as illustrated before, ARIMA (4, 2, 1) was chosen as the best-fit
model among other specifications. Regarding ARDL models, based on the same criterion,
Dynamic ARDL (10, 3, 0, 3, 2, 4, 1) was selected as the best model. Concerning the daily deaths,
the selected model is ARIMA (1, 1, 4) while Dynamic ARDL (9, 0) was picked. ARIMA-ARCH
method for new cases and deaths models is also estimated and evaluated to treat the problem of
heteroscedasticity in the ARIMA models.
The performance of the chosen models of daily cases and deaths respectively are compared using
different measures of forecasting error accuracy. Table 4 shows the forecast error of these models
in terms of RMSE, MAE, MAPE and SMAPE over the period of 14 days.

It is noticed that based on the different error measures, the ARIMA model is the best to forecast
daily cases, whereas Dynamic ARDL is the most accurate one for daily deaths. Moreover, the
MAPE indicates that only ARIMA method has highly accurate forecasts in the new cases model,
with error magnitude less than 10%, whereas both ARIMA-ARCH and Dynamic-ARDL obtained
a good forecast according to Lewis (1982) criterion. For the death model, the opposite is true since
Dynamic ARDL and ARIMA-ARCH have highly accurate forecasts, whereas ARIMA only has a
good forecast. Comparison among models can be also done across models using the MAPE since
it is unit independent measures. Dynamic ARDL of the new deaths is the best one with the least
forecasting errors.
The graphical investigation confirms the latter results. Figure 6 and Figure 7 compare the results
of the preceding methods for the ex-post period (26 August - 8 September), and illustrate that
ARIMA model provides the closest results to the actual data for daily cases, whereas Dynamic
ARDL is the closest to the actual daily deaths.

5.2.2 Ex-Ante Forecasting Results
To generate ex-ante forecasting using econometric methods, the future values of the explanatory
variables have to be forecasted first. The ARIMA method is used to forecast the future values of
the explanatory variables of the two models before proceeding to forecasting the values of new
cases and deaths. Table 5 illustrates the predicted values of infections and deaths at the end of each
month of the forecasting horizon using different forecasting methods for each model for
comparison.

ARIMA-ARCH

Although the ARIMA model has the highest forecast accuracy for the new cases model, we display
it along with ARIMA-ARCH only for comparison purposes. As demonstrated by the hereinabove
Figure, the two-time series methods anticipate a decrease in the daily infections although ARIMAARCH model predicts less fall than ARIMA. The first anticipates new infections to drop from 187
cases on September 8, 2020 to reach 3 cases by November 7 while the latter forecasts only 1 new
case by that day. To add more, total number of infections on 7 November 2020 are anticipated to
reach 102,352 and 103,365 cases by ARIMA and ARIMA-ARCH respectively. That is, a 2.12%
and 3.13% increase in the number of infections is predicted.
According to Dynamic ARDL, the daily cases soar continually up to the end of the forecasting
period to reach millions of cases. Caution needed when interpreting the latter results since the
future values of the mobility variables are estimated without any restrictions on the full capacity
of the different mobility places over time. Therefore, the increasing rate of movements to these
places increases the number of new cases strongly as well.
In the same way, Figure 9 presents the results of the fitted models for daily kills. The results of
dynamic ARDL (the best forecasting model) and ARIMA-ARCH revealed that daily deaths tend
to decline over time across the period of forecasting.

Dynamic-ARDL

Despite anticipating a decreasing mortality rate, there is a small difference between the two
models’ outcomes. For instance, it is predicted that the number of deaths tends to fall seriously
from 19 case at September 8 to 1 and 9 deaths at the end of the forecasting period (7th November)
according to the dynamic ARDL and ARIMA-ARCH models respectively. In sum, total death toll
is predicted to reach 5,938 (Dynamic ARDL) or 6,294 (ARIMA-ARCH) at the end of the
forecasting horizon. To put it differently, the number of deaths is foreseen to rise by 13.21% or
6.80%. On the other side, mortality rate related to Covid-19 is expected to increase continuously
using ARIMA forecasting model to reach 75 daily deaths, and 8,024 as total deaths by the end of
the forecasting period.

6. Discussion
Although more data and information are needed, econometric models can be useful in predicting
confirmed infections and deaths as well as future pandemic spread rates if the spread of the virus
does not change very oddly. Undoubtedly, it is globally well known that this virus is new and has
the potential to be highly transmissible in addition to growing fears of a powerful second wave.
This ability may influence all expectations, but to our knowledge and time of estimation these
models are among the best and most recent.
Regarding the current situation in Egypt, the last month has witnessed the rise of the infection rate
by 0.29% whilst the death rate has fallen by 0.27% and the recovery rate has increased by 23.54%.
Obviously, this is due to the serious early list of closures and policies imposed by the Egyptian
government which aimed at encouraging citizens to stay at home to stop the spread of infections.
Additionally, three-month after directing the previously mentioned closure at end of June the
government started reopening to avoid GDP decline, income losses and poverty increase. Despite
resulting in upward movement, the number of infections kept on decreasing since mid-July. This
may be because an increasing number of Egyptians are taking social distancing measures seriously

and committing to preventive measures to limit coronavirus outbreak as a result of increased level
of awareness.
Chiefly, the results of the utilized models conclude that mobility of population is affecting the
incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly. As expected, an increase in mobility related to
grocery and pharmacy places, recreational outlets, and workplaces by 1% is associated with higher
incidence of Covid-19 by 14%, 30%, and 21% respectively. Therefore, the spread of Covid-19 is
caused by increasing mobility, especially recreation places such as restaurants, cafes, shopping
centers, theme parks, museums, libraries and movie theaters, in addition to workplaces. Moreover,
the spread of Covid-19 by 1% more tends to increase the possibility of deaths by 0.72% on average
in the long run.
Ex-post forecasting is performed for a period of two weeks (26 August - 8 September) using both
time series and econometric techniques to choose the most accurate forecast for each model to be
used in the ex-ante forecasting of the new cases and new deaths models. ARIMA is the best for
the new cases model, while Dynamic ARDL is the best for the new deaths model. Results of other
forecasts, which obtained using different techniques, are also shown for comparison.
The ex-ante forecasting results using different approaches reveal two different suggested Scenarios
to the future Covid-19 epidemic. Table 6 illustrates the growth rates of the forecasts of infections
and deaths at each month of the forecasting horizon using the two Scenarios, along with the actual
growth rates. First and the more accurate Scenario - according to our forecasting accuracy
measures - is the Optimistic Scenario. It is expected that the number of infections by the virus is
decreasing continuously to reach only one case daily by total number of 102,352 cases at the 7th
November. Moreover, the anticipated number of kills due to Covid-19 is predicted to fall seriously
from 19 case at September 8 to 9 deaths by total of 5,938 deaths at the end of the forecasting
horizon. Thus, the results show possible containment of the pandemic. Figure 10 illustrates this
optimistic Scenario along with the actual data of the new infections and deaths of Covid-19 over
the period (15th of March – 7th of November).

On the other side, other forecasting techniques - although less accurate ones – reveal a sharp
increase in infections by the coronavirus to reach millions of cases on the 7th of November. This
pessimistic Scenario suggests that the majority of persons in Egypt is expected to be infected by
the virus at the end of the forecasting period (Leading to herd immunity). However, this huge
increase in the number of infections, 33.6% daily growth rate on average over the forecasting
period, is associated with much less growth rate of the number of deaths over the same forecasting
horizon. The latter is only 2.3% daily on average of all the forecasting period to reach its maximum
of 75 daily deaths by total of 8,023 deaths at the end of the forecasting horizon. Moreover, the
growth rate of deaths is increasing steadily across time, while the daily growth rate of infection is
increasing sharply from month to month as illustrated in Table 5. The latter result suggests huge
spread of the coronavirus with less risk of deaths in the coming two months. So, quicker spread,
with less number of killed persons.
Even if the pessimistic Scenario is less likely to occur according to our forecasting accuracy
measures, policy makers have to put it into consideration for best control of the epidemic.
Since the future of Covid-19 depends on the decisions made in addition to community engagement
practices among others, countries should plan and be ready for any scenario. To maintain the
expected trajectory of the pandemic in Egypt, many restrictions must be continued and emergency
mechanisms need to be considered. Regarding the community role, social distancing measures
must be strictly adhered to. In some countries such as England, Hong Kong, Singapore, and
Norway, a 1-meter distance is recommended while, Germany and Spain endorsed a 1.5 meter and
a 2-meter space is advised in Japan and South Korea (Han, et al., 2020). Besides, following the
declared health precautions and rules to ensure that infection is avoided or transmitted is

substantial. Consequently, maintaining good hygiene is of great importance, that is, wearing masks
everywhere, frequently washing hands and staying home in case of being sick. It should also be
noted that it is possible that this expected pattern will change, but this depends on the actions of
the people that facilitate the work of the health system in each country.
Speaking of the role of the government, plans of re-imposing lockdown are recommended, upon
setting certain epidemiological threshold. To put it another way, some governments have marked
50 new cases per 100,000 residents per state for 7 continuous days as the threshold for re-closing.
It is also recommended continuing working from home for those who are more vulnerable to
infection while promoting distancing and hygiene rules for workers who will be physically present
at workplaces. For the purpose of preventing more infections to happen, it is recommended to
enhance the effective find, test, trace, isolate, and support systems. Hence, temperature checking
needs to be generalized before entering different places in addition to using the sterilization gates.
As a trial to prevent predicted deaths or to deal with possible second wave of infections especially
following reopening, a support to the Egyptian health-system is crucial. That is increasing the
number of hospitals equipped with intensive care units and ventilators for patients. Additionally,
providing protective equipment for the medical sector staff and health-care workers.
Moreover, it is advised to continue restricting flights from severely infected countries. While
screening individuals coming from other countries and quarantine measures are essential to pick
potential infections and prevent more transmission. Regarding internal mobility, additional trains
and buses can be recommended to run to alleviate overcrowding, especially at peak times. Equally
important is keeping restrictions on all different social gatherings to limit the further spread of the
virus.
These recommended strategies should support Egypt in stopping viral spread of the virus and avoid
returning to full lockdown.
