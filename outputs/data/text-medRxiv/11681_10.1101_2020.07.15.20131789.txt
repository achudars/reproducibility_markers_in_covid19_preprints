INTRODUCTION

59

In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the relationship between levels of viral replication and

60

disease severity remains unclear. In prior analyses of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak, viral load

61

within the nasopharynx was associated with worsened disease severity and increased mortality1,2.

62

However, it is also clear that there are significant differences between SARS-CoV-1 and 2,

63

including differences in the temporal nature of viral shedding3,4, transmissibility5, epidemiology6,

64

and clinical manifestations7,8. Additional studies are needed to determine whether the degree of

65

SARS-CoV-2 viral load within the respiratory tract or other compartments may predict disease

66

outcomes.

67

The need for additional SARS-CoV-2 viral studies is not only limited to respiratory

68

specimens but extends to the blood. Respiratory failure is the primary cause of death in patients

69

with COVID-19, but complications arising from a hyperactive immune response and vascular

70

damage are also prominently featured both in the pulmonary and extrapulmonary systems9-13. In

71

addition, there is a suggestion that detectable plasma viremia using a qualitative qPCR assay may

72

correlate with disease severity14, although studies to date have been hampered by the lack of viral

73

load quantification. Together, these findings suggest the importance of systemic SARS-CoV-2

74

viral circulation, but little is known about the prevalence and magnitude of plasma viremia in

75

predicting COVID-19 outcomes. In this study, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral load from the

76

respiratory tract, plasma and urine of participants with a diverse range of COVID-19 severity,

77

including individuals requiring hospitalization, symptomatic non-hospitalized participants, and

78

those recovered from COVID-19 disease.

RESULTS

80

Participant characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 viral loads

81

We enrolled 88 hospitalized participants with COVID-19, 94 symptomatic individuals who were

82

evaluated in a respiratory infection clinic, of whom 16 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by

83

standard clinical testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, and 53 participants diagnosed with COVID-19

84

who had symptomatically recovered. Table 1 shows baseline demographic information, disease

85

severity and hospital outcomes. Hospitalized participants were significantly older than both

86

symptomatic outpatients and individuals recovered from COVID-19 (Kruskal-Wallis P<0.001).

87

Participants recruited in the outpatient setting had the shortest time between the start of

88

symptoms and the time of sample collection (median 5 days) compared to hospitalized

89

individuals (median 13 days) and recovered participants (median 27 days).

90

We report SARS-CoV-2 viral load analysis both as a continuous variable and analyzed as

91

a categorical variable (detectable versus undetectable) given that only qualitative commercial

92

qPCR testing is available for clinical care. Amongst hospitalized individuals, the majority still

93

had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the time of initial sample collection, including 50% with

94

detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasopharyngeal swab, 67% by oropharyngeal swab, and 85%

95

by sputum testing. We also performed SARS-CoV-2 viral load testing from specimens outside of

96

the respiratory tract and found that 27% of participants had detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma

97

viremia and 10% had detectable viral RNA in the urine (Fig 1). In those with detectable plasma

98

viremia, the median viral load was 2.4 log10 RNA copies/mL (range 1.8 – 3.8 log10 RNA

99

copies/mL), which was significantly lower than that detected in sputum (median 4.4 log10 RNA

100

copies/mL, range 1.8 – 9.0 log10 RNA copies/mL, Wilcoxon signed-rank P < 0.001).

101

Levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral load were significantly correlated between each of the

102

different respiratory specimen types (nasopharyngeal vs oropharyngeal Spearman r = 0.34, P =

103

0.03; nasopharyngeal vs sputum r = 0.39, P = 0.03, oropharyngeal vs sputum r = 0.56, P = 0.001,

104

Supplemental Fig 1). Plasma viral load was modestly associated with both nasopharyngeal (r =

105

0.32, P = 0.02) and sputum viral loads (r = 0.36, P = 0.049), but not significantly associated with

106

oropharyngeal viral loads. There was no significant association between urine viral load and viral

107

loads from any other sample types.

108
109

SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with disease severity and laboratory abnormalities

110

Detectable plasma viremia was generally associated with increased disease severity amongst

111

hospitalized participants as 44% of those on a ventilator had detectable viremia compared to 19%

112

of those receiving supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula and 0% of individuals not requiring

113

supplemental oxygen (Χ2 P = 0.006, Fig 1b). Two of the 16 (13%) COVID-19 diagnosed

114

outpatients were found to also have detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia, compared to none

115

of the 74 outpatients with negative clinical nasopharyngeal testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and

116

none of the 53 recovered individuals who had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. None

117

of the 18 plasma samples from intensive care unit participants collected in the pre-COVID era

118

were found to have detectable plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

119

In hospitalized participants, higher plasma viral loads were significantly associated with

120

several markers of inflammation and disease severity, including lower absolute lymphocyte

121

counts (Spearman r = -0.31, P = 0.008), and higher levels of both CRP (r = 0.40, P < 0.001) and

122

IL-6 (r = 0.50, P < 0.001). Significant associations were also detected between nasopharyngeal

123

and sputum viral loads and these three markers (Fig 2a). When analyzed as a categorical

124

variable, individuals with detectable plasma, nasopharyngeal or sputum viral loads had

125

significantly lower absolute lymphocyte counts, and higher CRP and IL-6 levels compared to

126

those without detectable plasma viremia (Fig 2b-d). Plasma, nasopharyngeal and/or

127

oropharyngeal viral loads were also significantly associated with increased levels of the

128

inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IP-10, MCP1, IFN-γ, and IL-1RA (Fig 2a).

129
130

SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and mortality risk

131

Compared to individuals who were discharged from the hospital, those who eventually died had

132

significantly higher levels of plasma viremia at the time of initial sampling (median plasma viral

133

load 1.0 vs 2.0 log10 RNA copies/mL, P = 0.009, Fig 3a), which occurred a median 11 days

134

before death. For hospitalized individuals with initial detectable viremia, 32% died vs 8% of

135

those without initial viremia (OR 5.5, P = 0.02, Fig 3e). We performed a sensitivity analysis to

136

assess whether plasma viremia may also predict mortality in those with the most severe disease.

137

For participants who were on ventilatory support at the time of initial sample collection, 43% of

138

those with detectable plasma viremia died compared to 17% of those without detectable plasma

139

viremia, although this comparison did not reach statistical significance (OR 3.8, P = 0.11). We

140

also performed an analysis in older participants as the majority of participants who died were at

141

least 70 years old. In those ≥70 years old with initial plasma viremia, 6 of 7 died (86%) vs 2 of 9

142

(22%) without initial viremia (OR 21, P = 0.02). Levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in respiratory

143

secretions were also higher in those who eventually died (Fig 3b-d), although the presence or

144

absence of detectable respiratory secretion viral RNA were not significantly associated with

145

increased risk of death (Fig 3f-h). Logistic regression analysis was also performed with viral

146

loads as a continuous variable and plasma, oropharyngeal and sputum viral loads were all

147

associated with increased risk of death (Supplementary Table 1).

148

A subset of hospitalized participants had longitudinal viral load measurements. Levels of

149

plasma and respiratory viral loads declined from the first and second sampling time points in

150

almost all participants, regardless of eventual participant outcome (Fig 4).

DISCUSSION

152

We report a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract, plasma, and urine viral

153

loads of 235 participants who were either hospitalized with COVID-19, evaluated as

154

symptomatic outpatients, or had recovered from COVID-19 disease. The results show a

155

relatively high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia in hospitalized individuals with

156

severe disease, but plasma viremia was also detected in symptomatic non-hospitalized

157

participants. Levels of SARS-CoV-2 viremia was also associated with markers of inflammation

158

and disease severity, including low lymphocyte counts, and elevated CRP and IL-6 levels. To

159

our knowledge, this is also the first report that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially detectable

160

plasma viremia, predicted the risk of death.

161

In contrast to prior reports suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is largely

162

confined to the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts15,16, we were able to detect plasma viremia

163

in a substantial proportion of both hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants. The prevalence

164

of SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia was lower than that found in respiratory secretions, but

165

detectable plasma viremia had a clear relationship with concurrent clinical disease severity,

166

lower absolute lymphocyte count, higher levels of inflammation and increased risk of death.

167

Across the spectrum of viral infections, the extent of viral load has been a predictor of disease

168

severity and progression, including for HIV17,18, Ebola19, influenza and other non-COVID-19

169

respiratory viral infections20-22. The detection of plasma viral load has been described for both

170

SARS-CoV-123,24 and SARS-CoV-214, but its role in pathogenesis and ability to predict clinical

171

outcomes remains unresolved. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that

172

SARS-CoV-2 is frequently detectable in plasma and that detectable viral load, both in plasma

173

and the respiratory tract, are associated with increased disease severity and mortality. Therefore,

174

the detection and quantification of viral RNA levels may aid in the risk stratification of patients

175

hospitalized with COVID-19. The association between SARS-CoV-2 viral load with levels of

176

CRP and IL-6 results also suggest that active viral infection could contribute to the

177

hyperinflammatory state that is a hallmark of severe COVID-1925. However, the causes of

178

inflammation in COVID-19 could be multifactorial, especially as a subset of participants had

179

elevated inflammatory markers without detectable plasma viremia. Additional studies are needed

180

to determine whether antiviral treatment may effectively interrupt this pathway and whether

181

levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral load could stratify patients into individuals who are more likely to

182

benefit from an antiviral agent versus those with isolated immune dysregulation who may benefit

183

more from an anti-inflammatory or immune-modifying agent13.

184

The source for the plasma viremia is still not fully defined and could reflect spillage from

185

the pulmonary tissue into the vasculature, but there is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can also

186

directly infect endothelial cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary

187

receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and can be found on both arterial and venous endothelial cells26 and

188

other perivascular cells27. Tissue studies have also revealed evidence of endothelitis with

189

perivascular inflammation12 and the extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other organs28.

190

While additional infectivity studies are needed to confirm that plasma viremia represents

191

infectious virions, these previously published support the concept that COVID-19 should be

192

considered more than an isolated respiratory tract infection and that endothelial infection and

193

systemic circulation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions may be contributing to the increasing

194

reports of extrapulmonary and micro- and macrovascular complications of COVID-19 that are

195

often disproportionate to the degree of disease severity9-12,29-32.

196

There is an intense search for biomarkers of COVID-19 disease progression that could

197

accelerate early-phase clinical studies of antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. There has been

198

an expectation that respiratory tract viral shedding could serve as such a surrogate biomarker, but

199

it is unclear if such assumptions are accurate. An example is the reported clinical benefit of

200

remdesivir33 despite the lack of evidence that remdesivir significantly reduces respiratory tract

201

viral loads34. We found only modest correlations between respiratory tract viral loads and those

202

of the plasma. This highlights the need for additional studies to assess whether these anatomic

203

compartments may serve as distinct sites of viral replication and whether antiviral medications

204

might have differential effects on viral respiratory tract shedding versus plasma viremia.

205

Our study has a few notable limitations. First, sputum samples were obtained for only a

206

subset of participants as many participants were unable to generate a sample. While sputum

207

samples had the highest frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection, this finding demonstrates a

208

potential limitation in their use as a reliable diagnostic modality. Our longitudinal analysis of

209

viral load changes was limited to a subset of participants due to limits on the frequency of blood

210

draws for hospitalized individuals and early discharges in those with relatively mild disease.

211

Additional studies of plasma viral load dynamics early in the course of disease are needed.

212

In summary, we report that SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia is commonly detected in

213

hospitalized individuals but can also be detected in symptomatic non-hospitalized outpatients

214

diagnosed with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, especially within plasma, are associated

215

with systemic inflammation, disease progression, and increased risk of death. The role of SARS-

216

CoV-2 as a mediator of vascular and extrapulmonary COVID-19 disease manifestations should

217

be further explored.

METHODS

256

Participant enrollment and sample collection

257

We enrolled hospitalized and non-hospitalized participants with COVID-19 in a longitudinal

258

sample collection study at two academic medical centers. Blood was collected from consented

259

hospitalized participants diagnosed with COVID-19, non-hospitalized symptomatic individuals

260

seeking care at a respiratory infection clinic, and participants who had recovered from known

261

COVID-19 disease. Nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and urine were also

262

collected from hospitalized participants. Nasopharyngeal swabs and oropharyngeal swabs were

263

collected in 3 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). A subset of hospitalized participants had

264

longitudinal samples collected. Plasma obtained from a cohort of individuals in the intensive

265

care unit from the pre-COVID-19 era were used as a comparator group35. Each participant’s

266

electronic medical record was reviewed to determine the oxygenation status (room air, on

267

oxygen by nasal cannula, or requiring ventilator support), demographics, comorbidities and the

268

outcome of the hospitalization (discharge or death). This study was approved by the Partners

Markers of inflammation and disease severity

272

Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and absolute lymphocyte count were recorded from the

273

electronic medical record. Thirty-five additional markers of inflammation were evaluated in

274

plasma by the Luminex xMAP assay (ThermoFisher): EGF, Eotaxin, FGF-basic, G-CSF, GM-

275

CSF, HGF, IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8,

276

IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (p40/p70) IL-13, IL-15, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, MIP-1α,

277

MIP-1β, RANTES, TNF-α, and VEGF.

SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load Quantification

279

Levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral load were quantified using the US CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 primers

280

and probe set36. Virions were pelleted from respiratory secretions, swab fluids, plasma, or urine

281

by centrifugation at approximately 21,000 x g for 2 hours at 4oC. The supernatant was removed

282

and 750 µL of TRIzol-LS™ Reagent (ThermoFisher) was added to the pellets and then incubated

283

on ice. Following incubation, 200 µL of chloroform (MilliporeSigma) was added and vortexed.

284

The mixtures were separated by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 15 minutes at 4oC, and

285

subsequently the aqueous layer was removed and treated with an equal volume of isopropanol

286

(Sigma). GlycoBlue™ Coprecipitant (ThermoFisher) and 100 µL 3M Sodium Acetate (Life

287

Technologies) were added to each sample and incubated on dry ice until frozen. RNA was

288

pelleted by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 45 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was discarded

289

and the RNA was washed with cold 70% ethanol. The RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated

290

water (ThermoFisher).

291

Each reaction contained extracted RNA, 1X TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix,

292

CG (ThermoFisher), the CDC N1 forward and reverse primers, and probe36. Viral copy numbers

293

were quantified using N1 qPCR standards in 16-fold dilutions to generate a standard curve. The

294

assay was run in triplicate for each sample and two non-template control (NTC) wells were

295

included as negative controls. Quantification of the Importin-8 (IPO8) housekeeping gene RNA

296

level was performed to determine the quality of respiratory sample collection. An internal virion

297

control (RCAS) was spiked into each sample and quantified to determine the efficiency of RNA

298

extraction and qPCR amplification37.

301

Levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral load at the time of initial hospital collection were compared by site

302

of sampling, disease severity and hospital outcome. SARS-CoV-2 viral load analysis was

303

performed both as continuous variables with non-parametric rank-based testing and as a

304

categorical variable (detectable vs undetectable) with Fisher’s exact and Χ2 tests given the

305

qualitative nature of current commercial qPCR tests. SARS-CoV-2 viral loads below 40 RNA

306

copies/mL were categorized as undetectable and set at 1.0 log10 RNA copies/mL. For the subset

307

of participants with repeated sampling, the sign test was used to assess viral load change between

308

the first and second time point. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman rank-based

309

testing. In the correlation analysis between the soluble inflammatory markers and viral load, a P-

310

value <0.01 between a marker and any of the viral load measurements was the threshold to

311

include that marker in the reported results. Logistic regression and other statistical analyses were

312

performed using GraphPad Prism 8 and SAS software, version 9.4. Only univariate analysis was

313

performed due to the available sample size, but we did perform sensitivity analysis for plasma

314

viral load effects based on disease severity and age.
