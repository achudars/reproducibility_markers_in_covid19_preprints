Abstract
The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take
drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the
governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the
still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with
non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental
model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the
measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the
model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and
predicted.

The Italian modeling of the outbreak was performed

close to the cases in Hubei on the 22/01/2020 (around
400). The population of the Hubei province and Italy is
also roughly the same: 60 million.

optimization of only five adjustable parameters. Indeed,
on the contrary of the Hubei outbreak, the model was
able to describe the Italian epidemiologic data with only
a parameter (γ ! ) for the kinetic of recovery. Moreover,
on the experience of the Chinese outbreak, the long-term
death kinetic was set to zero (δ& = 0). The model
parameters obtained are reported in Table 1 and in

with the findings of [21].
According to the model prediction the Italian
outbreak on the 17th of April is on the peak region, 42
days (3τ: ) after the lockdown. It is interesting to note
that despite the lower kinetic of infection (almost half of
the Chinese), the retard in the application of the
lockdown measures, which increased the number of
circulating infected people before the lockdown, as well
as the initial weaker restriction measures with respect to
the Chinese ones, produced a long lasting epidemic.
