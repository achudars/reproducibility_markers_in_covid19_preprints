Abstract
In May 2020 the UK introduced a Test, Trace, Isolate programme in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included Version 1 of the
NHS contact tracing app. We used COVID-19 daily case data to infer incidence of new
infections and estimate the reproduction number R for each of 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities
in England, and at the National level, before and after the launch of the programme on the Isle
of Wight. We used Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods to estimate R, and compared
the Isle of Wight to other areas using a synthetic control method. We observed significant
decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch. These results
are robust across each of our approaches. Our results show that the sub-epidemic on the Isle of
Wight was controlled significantly more effectively than the sub-epidemics of most other Upper
Tier Local Authorities, changing from having the third highest reproduction number R (of 150)
before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards. The data is not yet available to establish a
causal link. However, the findings highlight the need for further research to determine the
causes of this reduction, as these might translate into local and national non-pharmaceutical
intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination becomes available.

Introduction
As part of efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 using non-pharmaceutical interventions,
many countries are prioritising community testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and
quarantining of contacts of cases [3]. Contact tracing usually requires individually questioning
index cases (individuals identified as having COVID-19), relying on their memory of past close
proximity contact events [4]; contact tracing may also be conducted via smartphone contact
tracing apps which can be used to pass anonymised notifications between new index cases and

their past contacts [5,6]. These two approaches are complementary: the former approach relies
on noticing and remembering contacts and an efficient infrastructure of trained public health
officials; the latter relies on establishing a well-calibrated new technology and appreciable
population uptake and adherence. The former is a more familiar intervention and a phone call
may be more effective once received, but the speed of notification of the latter may be critical
given the speed of COVID-19 transmission [5]. In May 2020, a pilot of this combined approach
was conducted on the Isle of Wight, an island to the south of England with 141,536 inhabitants,
of whom 24% are over the age of 65 [7].
The UK national policy of “Test, Trace, Isolate” (TTI) included community testing and contact
tracing conducted by Public Health England using the Contact Tracing and Advisory Service
(CTAS). On the Isle of Wight it also included version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. The app
was configured for people to report two characteristic symptoms of COVID-19: cough and fever.
Shortly after reporting symptoms, the app anonymously notified other app users who had been
in recent contact with the individual, and offered generic guidance on how to reduce risks of
transmission to others (though no instructions to self-isolate or quarantine).
The Isle of Wight TTI programme was launched on 5 May 2020, with the app made available for
download for the general public from 7 May. The app was downloaded by more than 54,000
people on the island during the trial period, corresponding to 38% of the population [8]. On 18
May community testing was introduced nationwide, initially for all people above the age of 5,
then on 28 May for everyone. Also on 28 May, manual contact tracing through the national
contact tracing service was re-introduced nationwide. At the time of writing, there is no contact
tracing app nationwide. The full timeline is shown in Figure 1.
Between the 6th May and 26 May, 160 cases on the Isle of Wight were reported to manual
contact tracing, resulting in 163 individuals receiving a notification and request to self-isolate,
and during the same period 1,524 people reported symptoms to the app resulting in 1,188
receiving an exposure notification.
In this study we report trends in incidence on the Isle of Wight before and during the period of
this pilot, and compare these trends with other areas of England. We focus on total incidence,
per capita incidence, and the reproduction number R. We do not analyse data on the function of
the contact tracing intervention; we rather explore whether the intervention might have been
associated with declines in rates of new infection that stand out compared to trends in other
areas of England.

Data on incidence of confirmed cases by area
New laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases are reported daily for each of 150 areas of England,
specifically Upper-tier Local Authorities (UTLAs), of which the Isle of Wight is one. There are two
categories of case data: “Pillar 1” data which consists of tests conducted in hospitals, for those
with a clinical need and health and care workers, and “Pillar 2” data from tests in the wider
population [9]. Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 data represent tests taken at different stages of individuals’
disease progression, which needs to be considered for analysis. Estimates of the total
population size for each UTLA were obtained from the Office for National Statistics [​10​].
Back-calculation of infection times
We used a back-calculation approach to estimate the distribution of the time of infection in Pillar
1 data, assuming that most Pillar 1 tests are derived from hospital patients. We used a
lognormal distribution with mean 5.42 days and standard deviation 2.7 days for the incubation
period following a meta-analysis [11], and a gamma distribution with mean 5.14 days and
standard deviation 4.2 days for the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation [12]. Analyses
were truncated at 14 June as calculation beyond this date would have been affected by missing
data 25-29 June [13].
Estimate of the generation time
The generation time distribution is the probability distribution of times elapsed between an
individual becoming infected and their transmitting to someone else. We used a gamma
distribution with mean 5.5 days and standard deviation 2.14 days as obtained by Ferretti et al.
(in prep.) combining data from [5, 14, 15, 16]. This distribution was converted into a discrete
distribution on integer time intervals, i.e. 0,1,2,3,... days post infection.
Renewal equation estimation for R(t)
We used Bayesian estimation of the instantaneous reproduction number [17] as implemented in
the software package EpiEstim [18,19]. To reduce oversensitivity to the priors when the number
of infections is very low, we used the posterior mode rather than the posterior mean as the
central estimate.
Nowcasting
We combined R with incidence per capita to provide a simple “nowcast” for each UTLA. For
each day we multiplied the estimated R value by the mean incidence per capita for the week
beginning three days before and ending three days afterwards.
Creating synthetic controls for the 150 UTLAs in England
We used a ‘synthetic control’ approach [20,21] to construct a comparison area for the Isle of
Wight. The approach creates a weighted average of other areas in England that matches the
Isle of Wight in the average R before the introduction of the pilot, as well as in distributions of
age and ethnicity. To choose the weights, we used a cross validation with a 19-day training
period followed by a 19-day validation period. Significance was determined using a permutation
test.

Maximum-Likelihood estimation of R
Pillar 2 daily case data based on community testing was not publicly available at the time of
writing for individual UTLAs, and the combined dataset available presents challenges for
accurate inference of incidence of new infections, so we did not perform the Bayesian EpiEstim
analysis on these datasets. Instead we used a Maximum-Likelihood estimation of the growth
rate ​r​ over defined time periods which clearly post-date the TTI interventions, and from these
estimated an average value of R for the Isle of Wight and at a national level [22]. We used
publicly available data for the Pillar 1 and combined pillars comparisons, and for Pillar 2 we
made use of Isle of Wight data obtained via private communication with Public Health England.
We also used Pillar 1 data for each UTLA to compare values of R in time periods before and
after the TTI interventions. This simple change-point analysis acts as a robustness check for our
earlier analyses as it does not depend on the same modelling assumptions.

Results
The incidence of new COVID cases decreased both in the Isle of Wight and nationally
during the period of study
In Figure 2 we show the number of new confirmed daily cases on the Isle of Wight and
“nationally”, by individual pillars (Figures 2A and 2B) and using the combined pillars data
released on 2 July 2020 (Figures 2C and 2D). By “nationally” we refer to the data available:
England for Pillar 1, the “UK except Wales” for Pillar 2, and England for the combined pillars
data. Pillar 1 data is available for the other nations of the UK over the same time period but
suffered from sporadic reporting which made incidence and R difficult to estimate with
confidence. We note that although it has become common to see Pillar 1 and 2 data displayed
in stacked histograms such as these, interpreting true incidence from these plots is non-trivial
because of the different lag times on testing infected individuals in the two pillars. Nevertheless,
there is a clear trend of declining incidence through May and June, even in the context of
increasing availability of tests.
Incidence decreased after the TTI intervention on the Isle of Wight more sharply than the
national trend
To compare between UTLAs with accurate timing information we used Pillar 1 daily case data
on the Isle of Wight (Figure 3A, green) and inferred the incidence of new infections (Figure 3A,
red). The number of new infections each day on the island was generally decreasing from
mid-April, although we do not have the data to be able to deduce whether this was entirely the
impact of the lockdown or whether the result is exaggerated by lack of test availability. We
hypothesise that the apparent uptick in new infections in late April is largely an artefact of the
increased availability of tests after the TTI intervention. We see a particular decline in incidence
straight after the launch of the TTI intervention on 5 May (dashed line). Since the
back-calculation relies on using around 10 days of future data, the inferred incidence over the
final 10 days is increasingly prone to underestimation and is shown shaded in grey in Figure 3A.
In Figure 3B and Figures 4–6 we truncate our results on 14 June for this reason. The trend in

incidence looks encouraging for the Isle of Wight but it is important to compare the incidence
with other areas in England that did not see the launch of the TTI programme on 5 May. Figure
3B shows the inferred incidence curves scaled per capita for each of the UTLAs, with the Isle of
Wight shown in red. We see that in mid-April per capita incidence on the Isle of Wight was
around average for English UTLAs, but by late May the incidence on the Isle of Wight was very
low. COVID-19 incidence therefore decreased more sharply on the Isle of Wight than in other
areas of England.
R decreased after the TTI intervention on the Isle of Wight more sharply than the national
trend
The value of the reproductive number R over time is shown in Figure 4. In these figures we
report for each date the estimate of R for the week which starts 3 days before and ends 3 days
afterwards. On the Isle of Wight, R declined rapidly after the TTI programme’s introduction
(dashed line) from a value of 1.0 on 5 May to 0.25 on 23 May. It then followed a fluctuating and
gradually rising trend to 0.54 on 14 June. However, incidence was very low during the period 23
May - 14 June (Figure 3A) so the confidence intervals on R are very wide (Figure 4A, grey). In
Figure 4B we plot the Isle of Wight’s time-varying reproduction number R alongside those of the
other UTLAs. The decline from 5 May to 23 May was much sharper than that of a typical UTLA.
In Figure 4C we compare R on the Isle of Wight (red) with the average R of other UTLAs and in
Figure 4D as a centile of all UTLAs. On 5 May the reproduction number R on the Isle of Wight
was high compared to the national average, shown in Figure 4C by the red line nearing the top
of the blue 95% range and in Figure 4D ranked in the 89th centile. By 23 May it was well below
the 5% range (Figure 4C, blue) and ranked lowest of all UTLAs 19-21 May (Figure 4D). R
therefore decreased more sharply on the Isle of Wight than in other areas of England.
In the final few weeks of the study an increasing majority of cases were recorded as Pillar 2
(Figure 2B), and Pillar 1 case numbers in all UTLAs decreased to nearly zero. We do not know
how consistent the magnitude of this shift from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 case numbers was across
UTLAs. The effect of the shift is that incidence and R calculated only from Pillar 1 decreased
rapidly to zero for all UTLAs (Figures 3B and 4C). The centile ranking of the Isle of Wight
(Figure 4D) therefore became higher but less meaningful (the statistical test for deviation loses
power).
Nowcasting
The “nowcast” for each UTLA (Figure 5A) shows that throughout April the epidemic on the Isle
of Wight had a size and growth comparable to that of an average UTLA in England, between the
25th and 75th centiles (Figure 5B). Following the TTI intervention the prospects for the Isle of
Wight looked significantly better than those for the majority of UTLAs, reaching the second
centile in late May. In the final few weeks of the study, incidence and R were both very low
leading to stochasticity and thus ceasing to be useful measures to compare epidemic trends
across areas.

Our results comparing incidence, R and nowcasts across UTLAs using Pillar 1 data (Figures 3B,
4B and 5A) are available in the ​EpiNow-C19 ​web application [1] where they can be explored in
more detail. These are provided alongside a daily extension of the analyses using the available
combined pillars dataset, noting that this data provides a better estimate of the number of
infections than Pillar 1 data alone but presents challenges for estimating timings and R.
The Isle of Wight has a lower R compared to the rest of England after the intervention
using a synthetic control approach
Since the demographics and trajectories of the sub-epidemics vary across UTLAs we used a
‘synthetic control’ approach [20] to create a more comparable control group for the Isle of Wight.
We combined data from all other English UTLAs and weighted their contributions to match the
evolution of R on the Isle of Wight before the introduction of the TTI pilot (Figure 6, left hand
panels). The choice of matching variables is to some extent subjective and can influence the
result of the analysis. We therefore consider two different scenarios, first using weekly averages
of the estimates of R alone, and second using additional demographic information. In both
cases we use a cross validation approach to guard against overfitting. Table S1 shows the
weights on the matching variables for the two scenarios. When we add population density and
measures of deprivation to Scenario 2, almost no weight is allocated to these variables and the
overall results remain unchanged (data not shown).
Both synthetic control scenarios show that R is lower for the Isle of Wight than for its synthetic
control during almost the entire period after the introduction of the TTI pilot. To establish the
statistical significance of this result we perform a permutation test by constructing synthetic
controls for all other UTLAs in England. We compute the difference between each UTLA and its
synthetic control (Figure 6, right hand panels). Using this method we find that the difference for
the IoW is statistically significant for part of May in both scenarios at the 5% level (see
Supplementary Material for more details).
Combining Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 test data: The Isle of Wight saw a significant decrease in R
after the TTI intervention compared to the rest of England
We used three different datasets (Pillar 1, Pillar 2 and the combined data) to obtain
Maximum-Likelihood estimates of R after the TTI interventions. Figure 7A shows the results
across the different pillar datasets. The reproduction number R on the Isle of Wight was
consistently lower than the “national” rate, by which we mean England for Pillar 1 and the
combined dataset, and the UK except Wales for Pillar 2 data. The national estimates have tight
confidence intervals (Figure 7A, error bars) thanks to being informed and constrained by more
data. R was lower for the Isle of Wight than nationally for data from Pillar 1 ( p = 6 × 10−6 ,
likelihood ratio test), from Pillar 2 ( p = 5 × 10−4 ) and from both combined ( p = 2 × 10−11 ). We
also used Pillar 1 data to compare R on the Isle of Wight to R for each UTLA individually before
the intervention from 1 March (Figure 7B) and afterwards (Figure 7C). By this estimation the Isle
of Wight experienced a striking reduction in its reproduction number, going from 1.3 in the
period before the TTI intervention to 0.5 in the study period afterwards. This is a particularly

notable change when compared with other UTLAs as it went from having the third highest
reproduction number before the intervention to the tenth lowest afterwards.

Discussion
We analysed the course of the COVID-19 epidemic on the Isle of Wight before and after the
launch of the Test, Trace, Isolate (TTI) programme including a test version of the mobile phone
contact tracing app and compared it to the epidemic in other areas of England and the UK. We
focussed on total incidence, per capita incidence, and the effective reproduction number R and
compared each using different approaches. We used an improved method to calculate R by
taking into account variable lag times between infection and case counts; the method can be
generalised to account for different distributions of lag times across data sources.
All analyses paint a consistent and encouraging picture. In mid-April the Isle of Wight was
experiencing moderate-to-high incidence per capita and a higher reproduction number R than a
typical UTLA. The launch of TTI on the Isle of Wight was followed by a short phase in which
case numbers increased, as expected with increased testing. However, the inferred incidence of
new infections and the reproduction number R declined sharply to below the English average,
and below predicted levels for a synthetic control, immediately upon introduction of TTI. This
finding is consistent across our analyses of Pillar 1, Pillar 2 and the combined pillars datasets,
and in both our Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood analyses.
These results are correlative: rapid decreases in the rate of new infections on the Isle of Wight
could be explained by multiple causes. Comparisons are statistically significant for every way in
which we analysed the data, suggesting that the effect of chance fluctuations alone is unlikely.
The introduction of TTI was accompanied by community discussions and national publicity. The
success could be due to the attention that the start of the programme on the Isle of Wight
received leading to increased care and physical distancing, although changes in movement are
not apparent from Google mobility data [23] (Supplementary Figure S1). All inhabitants received
a letter and an invitation to download the app and contact tracers might have been highly
motivated to make the first phase of the launch a success. The start of the programme and the
testing of the app might have led to a positive community response and an increased
awareness. A hospital-based app usability study concluded that the app had been embraced
and adopted well during the initial trial period, whilst making recommendations for
improvements for future versions [24]. Contact tracing could have contributed to the drop in
infections, both through the manual/CTAS system, and through the use of the app by 38% of
inhabitants. Alternatively, the success in reducing infections on the Isle of Wight might be
attributable to reasons other than the launch of the TTI programme.
The national TTI programme was launched on 28 May during a period of gradual relaxation of
lockdown measures which began on 10 May. It is possible that this is why we did not see a

strong decrease in incidence and R at this point; it was also towards the end of our period of
study so there was little opportunity to observe a more gradual decline.
This study has limitations. Data from the Contact Tracing and Advisory Service (CTAS) and time
series of cases traced by the app are not yet publicly available. This study is therefore unable to
evaluate the effect of the app independently of the effect of the wider TTI programme. We did
not adjust for changes in testing practice, and so likely overestimated the reproduction number
over time when widespread community testing became available in the week beginning 5th May
in the Isle of Wight, and in other areas in the week beginning 18 May. We hypothesise that
these biases become less pronounced after one week. The Isle of Wight’s synthetic controls are
not perfect matches, as is evident from several time periods that are significantly different
between the Isle of Wight and its synthetic control before the start of the TTI pilot. This is,
however, not surprising given that the ​Isle of Wight's unusual epidemic trajectory and geography
make it harder to find a perfect synthetic control.
We are currently using the Public Health England data which is published daily [2] to provide an
approximate surveillance and nowcasting application ​EpiNow-C19 [​ 1]. To improve the accuracy
of this and to build on the results of this study, we recommend that local area data is made
publicly available for all regions of the UK, either separated by Pillar or with similarly informative
timing information such as the date of onset of symptoms. We encourage further analyses
comparing sub-epidemics across geographical areas as the TTI programme evolves, with
focused data collection that allows evaluations of the separate TTI components. In particular,
knowing the proportion of cases from individuals who were already quarantined at the point of
diagnosis is a strong indicator of the effectiveness of TTI. Tracking the progression of local
sub-epidemics and identifying the key determinants of successful suppression will be crucial for
informing local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies.

Data on incidence of confirmed cases by area
We used publicly available reports of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 data until 30 June 2020 [9,10]. Pillar 1
data was available by Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) whereas Pillar 2 was reported as a
national daily total. On 1 July 2020, Public Health England stopped reporting Pillar 1 cases
alone, and on 2 July after a deduplication procedure they began publishing daily Pillar 1 and 2
case numbers combined at the levels of countries, regions, UTLAs and Lower Tier Local
Authorities (LTLAs) [25,26]. Although Pillar 1 data does not give a complete picture of confirmed
cases and is restricted to the UTLA level, we focus on Pillar 1 cases for our estimation of
incidence and the time changing reproduction number R(t) because these are the most
consistently reported over time and across areas. The combined pillars dataset presents
challenges for interpreting incidence of new infections because of differences in timing: cases
are reported by date of swab test, which for a Pillar 2 test is likely to be shortly after symptom
onset so around 4-7 days post-infection, but for Pillar 1 is likely to be shortly after admission to
hospital so around 7-12 days post-infection [12]. Pillar 2 daily case data for the Isle of Wight was
obtained via private communication with Public Health England. This data can be approximated
by subtracting the Pillar 1 data from the combined data; the differences caused by the
deduplication procedure are slight as can be seen by comparing Figures 2A and 2C.
Back-calculation of infection times
For each of the 150 areas of England under study, we have a time-series of reported cases C t ,
where C t is the number of cases newly diagnosed via hospital testing, where the swab was
taken on day ​t​. We used a back-calculation approach to infer the time-series of infection times
of these cases I t . Let ζ s be the probability distribution of times elapsed ​s​ between being

infected and being swab-tested in hospital. For a case infected at time ​t-s​ the probability that
they are swab-tested at time ​t​ is ζ s . Conversely, for a case swab-tested at time ​t​, the probability
that they were infected at time ​t-s​ is ζ s I t−s / ∑ ζ u I t−u , i.e. the backwards-in-time delay distribution
u

is not in general equal to the forwards-in-time distribution. However, we make the simplifying
assumption that incidence changes sufficiently slowly across the range of ζ s (about a week)
that ζ s I t−s / ∑ ζ u I t−u ≃ ζ s , and so we estimate that, of the people who became Pillar 1 confirmed
u

cases, the number infected at time ​t​ is I t = ∑ ζ s C t+s .
s

For ζ s we took the convolution of the incubation period distribution and the distribution for time
from symptoms to hospital visit, making the assumption that the majority of the Pillar 1 tests
were for patients. For the incubation period we used meta-analysis results indicating a
lognormal distribution with mean 5.42 days and standard deviation 2.7 days [14] (specifically,

the results excluding those of Ma et al for which bias was detected [14]). For time from
symptoms to hospital visit time we used a gamma distribution with mean 5.14 days and
standard deviation 4.2 days [12].
Back-calculation of incidence leads to right-censoring towards the present by an amount
corresponding to roughly the mean of ζ s , and so we truncate analyses 10 days before the last
date of “reliable” data. That is, we truncate analyses at 14 June because accurate estimates
after this time would require complete data beyond 24 June, but case numbers within the last 5
days of the dataset (25-29 June) should be considered incomplete [9].
Renewal equation estimation for R(t)
The time-varying effective reproduction number R(t) is a standardized measure for the rate of
spread of an infection at time t. Several definitions exist; here we used the instantaneous
reproduction number [17]. Use of this measure and back-calculation from reporting dates were
recently recommended by a survey of methods [27] and has been implemented across many
different countries for COVID-19 [28]. A Bayesian method of estimation of this measure is
implemented in the software package EpiEstim [18,19]. Specifically, our definition of R(t) was
∞

R(t) = I t / ∑ ws I t −s where I t is the number of inferred infections on day ​t​ and ws is the
s=0

generation time distribution for day ​s.​ If the Bayesian prior for R(t) is a gamma distribution with
shape and scale parameters (a, b) and if the number of infections is Poisson distributed, then
the posterior distribution for the reproduction number is also gamma distributed [18] with
parameters (a′, b′) given by a′ = a +

t

(

∑ I s and b′ = b/ 1 + b

)

.

To reduce oversensitivity to the priors (a, b) when the number of infections is very low, instead
of reporting as the central estimate of R(t) the posterior mean (which is a′b′ and is the default in
EpiEstim) we report instead, as the central estimate, the posterior mode, namely (a′ − 1)b′ . The
choice of posterior mode as a central tendency is common in Bayesian statistics, and reduces
the tendency to obtain high estimates of R(t) when there are very few reported cases in an
area. We report the usual 95% credibility intervals.
Nowcasting
The future course of an epidemic depends on both the current number of infectious individuals
and the effective reproduction number R. In the last month of this study the Isle of Wight had a
consistent pattern of recording just one Pillar 1 case every 5-7 days. Although we know that
there were also Pillar 2 cases, the Pillar 1 case count is consistent with a single chain of
transmission where one individual infects exactly one other: a reproduction number of 1.
However, the short-term forecast is clearly better for the island than it would be for another
UTLA with a reproduction number of 1 but many Pillar 1 cases per 100,000 population. We
combine R with incidence per capita to provide a simple “nowcast” for each UTLA in the
following way: for each UTLA on each date we consider the week which starts 3 days before

and ends 3 days afterwards. We multiply the estimated value of R in that week by the mean
incidence per capita for that week to provide a simple projection of the expected number of new
cases per capita per day in that area in the near future.
Creating synthetic controls for the 150 UTLAs in England
The ‘synthetic control’ method was developed to evaluate the effect of a treatment on the
aggregate level, e.g., regions, when only one region is treated [20, 21]. The method provides a
data-driven manner of constructing a more similar comparison unit. The synthetic control is
constructed as a weighted average of all ‘donor’ (control, untreated) units. The vector ​W​ of
donor unit weights is chosen based on matching variables ​X​ such that the outcome variable of
the synthetic control most closely resembles the outcome variable of the treated unit in the
pre-treatment period. In our setting, the Isle of Wight is the treated region and the treatment is
the introduction of the TTI pilot. The donor units are all other UTLAs in England. The outcome
variable ​Y​ is the daily value of R, estimated as described above. As matching variables ​X​ we
use age bands, ethnicity shares in the population, and weekly averages of the estimated values
of R.
We used the ​synth​ package in Stata to construct the synthetic control. The weights are chosen
over ​T ​days and ​N = 149​ donor units. Define ​Y​treat​ as a (​T​ ⨉ 1) vector of the treatment unit’s
outcome variable, i.e., R on the Isle of Wight. ​Y​donor​ is a (​T​ ⨉ ​N)​ matrix of the donor units’
​
outcome variable. There are J matching variables. Define ​Xtreat​
​ = (​X​treat​1​, …, ​X​treat​J)’
as a (​J​ ⨉ 1)
vector of matching variables for the treatment unit and similarly ​Xdonor​
​
as the corresponding (​J​ ⨉
N)​ matrix of matching variables for the donor units. Define ​W​ as an (​N​ ⨉ 1) vector of weights
that sum to one: ​W​ is a possible ​synthetic control.​ Finally, define ​V ​as a (​J​ ⨉ ​J​) diagonal matrix
of matching variable weights. Thus ​W​ contains the weights across donor units and ​V​ contains
the weights across matching variables. Then the optimal synthetic control W* and the
associated symmetric matrix V* solve the following minimisation problems:
W * = arg minW

√(X

treat

− X donor W )′V * (X treat − X donor W )

V * = arg minV (Y treat − Y donor W * (V ))′(Y treat − Y donor W * (V ))
To provide robustness against overfitting, we determined the matching variables weights (​V​) by
cross validation. Specifically, we split the pre-treatment period into two equal-length periods, the
training period​ and the ​validation period, ​so ​T​ = 19 days for each of the two periods​.​ The
minimisation was conducted twice, first to find a W train using training period data and a V val
using validation period data, and again using data from the validation period to find W * by
setting V * = V val found in the first minimisation.
To test whether the difference between the Isle of Wight data and its synthetic control
is statistically different from zero, we used a permutation test. First, we created synthetic
controls for all 150 areas in England and calculated the difference between the outcome
variable in each area and its synthetic control. The Isle of Wight was deemed significantly

Maximum-Likelihood estimation of R
We estimated R(t) for Pillar 1 data because it is comparable across time and space; however,
valuable information is present in Pillar 2 data based on community testing. Because this was
not collected consistently over time, and community testing was introduced on the Isle of Wight
before the rest of the country (Figure 1), we performed three separate analyses using Pillar 1
data, Pillar 2 data and the combined dataset, estimating for each the exponential rate of change
r​ over defined time periods of analysis that clearly pre-date and post-date the introduction of
TTI. For a given series of cases C t in a time period [t1 , t2 ] , we estimated the rate of change by

respect to the intercept K 0 and the slope ​r.​ We used the likelihood ratio test to compare the

slope between two time series (that for the Isle of Wight versus that for elsewhere): we
compared the likelihoods obtained from a model constrained to use the same slope ​r​ for the two
series versus a model with freedom to select a different slope for each series. Ranges [t1 , t2 ]
were chosen so as to represent the time period of interest, taking into account delays in
reporting of cases relative to underlying infections, namely 5 days for Pillar 2 cases and the
combined data, and 10 days for Pillar 1 cases alone. We also remove the final 5 days of data
available for each data set since these may be incomplete [9]. The start and end dates are
(β+ r) α
given explicitly in Table S2. Finally, we use the relation R = ( β ) to determine R from r [22]
when the generation time is gamma-distributed, using values α = 6.6 and β = 1.2 [Ferretti et al.
