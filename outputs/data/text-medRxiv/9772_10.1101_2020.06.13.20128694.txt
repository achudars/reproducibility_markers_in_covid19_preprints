ABSTRACT
Background: No studies have reported comparisons of mental health symptoms prior to and
during COVID-19 in vulnerable populations. Objectives were to compare anxiety and depression
symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition, the autoimmune disease
systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma), including continuous change scores, proportion with
change ³ 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and factors associated with changes,
including country.
Methods: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were
linked to COVID-19 data collected April 9 to April 27, 2020. Anxiety symptoms were assessed
with the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale (MCID = 4 points) and depression symptoms with the
Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (MCID = 3 points). Multiple linear and logistic regression were
used to assess factors associated with continuous change and change ³ 1 MCID.
Findings: Among 435 participants (Canada = 98; France = 159; United Kingdom = 50; United
States = 128), mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to
5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to
France, adjusted scores from the United States and United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI
1.7 to 5.9) and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were not significantly
different. Odds of increasing by ³ 1 MCID were twice as high for the United Kingdom (2.0, 95%
CI 1.0 to 4.2) and United States (1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2). Participants who used mental health
services pre-COVID had adjusted increases 3.7 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.7) less than other
participants.
Interpretation: Anxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during
COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition. Increase was larger in the
United Kingdom and United States than in Canada and France but substantially less for people
with pre-COVID-19 mental health treatment.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study: We referred to a living systematic review that is evaluating mental
health changes from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19 by searching 7 databases, including 2
Chinese language databases, plus preprint servers, with daily updates
(https://www.depressd.ca/covid-19-mental-health). As of June 13, 2020, only 5 studies had
compared mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19. In 4 studies of university
students, there were small increases in depression or general mental health symptoms but
minimal or no increases in anxiety symptoms. A general population study from the United
Kingdom reported a small increase in general mental health symptoms but did not differentiate
between types of symptoms. No studies have reported changes from pre-COVID-19 among
people vulnerable due to pre-existing medical conditions. No studies have compared mental
health changes between countries, despite major differences in pandemic responses.
Added value of this study: We evaluated changes in anxiety and depression symptoms
among 435 participants with the autoimmune condition systemic sclerosis and compared results
from Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to compare mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 in any vulnerable
population. These are the first data to document the substantial degree to which anxiety
symptoms have increased and the minimal changes in depression symptoms among vulnerable
individuals. It is also the first study to examine the association of symptom changes with country
of residence and to identify that people receiving pre-COVID-19 mental health services may be
more resilient and experience less substantial symptom increases than others.
Implications of all the available evidence: Although this was an observational study, it
provided evidence that vulnerable people with a pre-existing medical condition have
experienced substantially increased anxiety symptoms and that these increases appear to be
associated with where people live and, possibly, different experiences of the COVID-19
pandemic across countries. By comparing with evidence from university samples, which found

that depression symptoms were more prominent, these data underline the need for accessible
interventions tailored to specific needs of different populations. They also suggest that mental
health treatments may help people to develop skills or create resilience, which may reduce
vulnerability to major stressors such as COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more than
400,000 deaths and has had devastating health, social, political, and economic consequences
worldwide. There are expected to be serious mental health implications during and beyond the
initial outbreak, but their degree and nature are not well understood.1-2
Many cross-sectional studies report percentages of participants above cutoff thresholds
on mental health symptom questionnaires during COVID-19. Such percentages, however, vary
substantially across otherwise similar populations even in normal times.3 Furthermore, they tend
to dramatically overestimate prevalence obtained from validated methods, and there is too
much heterogeneity to correct for differences statistically.4,5 Thus, studies that directly evaluate
changes are needed.
Based on a living systematic review,3,6 as of June 13, 2020, only 5 studies had compared
mental health prior to and during COVID-19. Four studies of university students suggest small
increases in depression but minimal or no increases in anxiety. A United Kingdom general
population study found small increases in general mental health symptoms but did not
differentiate between anxiety and depression symptoms. No studies have evaluated mental
health changes among people at risk of COVID-19 complications due to pre-existing medical
conditions. Furthermore, despite important differences in pandemic responses across countries,
no studies have compared mental health changes between countries.
People with the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) are
representative of patients with pre-existing medical conditions that put them at risk during
COVID-19. More than 40% have interstitial lung disease, many are frail, and use of
immunosuppressant drugs is common.7,8 The Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention
Network (SPIN) Cohort routinely collects mental health outcomes at 3- to 6-month intervals.8-10
The SPIN COVID-19 Cohort was initiated to collect data during COVID-19 and allows

comparison of mental health symptoms prior to and during COVID-19 for participants enrolled in
both cohorts.
Our objective was to compare anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale11,12) and
depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 [PHQ-8]13) symptoms before and after onset of
COVID-19 among people with SSc, including (1) continuous score changes; (2) proportion with
change scores of at least one minimal clinically important difference (MCID); (3) proportion
initially under a cutoff threshold who changed by at least 1 MCID and reached the threshold;
and (4) factors associated with changes, including country, comparing results from Canada,
France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
METHODS
This was a longitudinal study that linked pre-COVID-19 data from the SPIN Cohort8-10 to
data collected during the baseline assessment of the separate SPIN COVID-19 Cohort between
April 9, 2020 and April 27, 2020 using the same measurement scales. Person-level,
deterministic linking was used with participant email addresses as the indentifier. The full
protocol for the SPIN COVID-19 Cohort and the present study is available online
(https://osf.io/kbncx/).
Participants and Procedure
SPIN Cohort participants must be aged ≥ 18 years and meet 2013 American College of
Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria for SSc, verified by a SPIN
physician.14 The SPIN Cohort is a convenience sample.8 Eligible participants are recruited at 47
SPIN sites10 in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Mexico, and
Australia during regular medical visits. Site personnel submit an online medical form to enrol
participants, after which participants receive an email with instructions to activate their SPIN
account and complete measures via the Cohort online portal in English, French, or Spanish.
Assessments are completed at 3-month intervals. SPIN Cohort participants provide informed
consent for cohort participation and for contact about additional SPIN studies.

From April 9 to April 27, 2020, SPIN Cohort participants who complete measures in
English or French were invited by email and popups during SPIN Cohort online assessments to
enrol in the SPIN COVID-19 Cohort. SPIN Cohort participants included in the present study (1)
were from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France; (2) completed the
PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale11,12 in English or French between July 1, 2019 and December
31, 2019, when China reported cases of pneumonia later identified as related to COVID-19 to
the World Health Organization15; and (3) enrolled in the SPIN COVID-19 Cohort and completed
baseline measures. SPIN COVID-19 measures were collected using the Qualtrics online survey
package.
The SPIN (#MP-05-2013-150) and SPIN COVID-19 (#2021-2286) Cohorts were approved
by the Research Ethics Committee of the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services
sociaux du Centre-Ouest-de-l'Île-de-Montréal. The SPIN Cohort was also approved by ethics
committees of SPIN sites.
Measures
Physician-reported SPIN Cohort data included sex, age, body mass index, time since SSc
diagnosis, SSc disease subtype (limited, diffuse, sine scleroderma), presence of interstitial lung
disease, and presence of overlap syndromes (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjögrens syndrome, idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, primary biliary cirrhosis,
autoimmune thyroid disease). Pre-COVID-19 patient-reported data included race or ethnicity,
employment status, health professional visit about mental health in previous 3 months,
interference of breathing problems in daily activities (single item, past-week, 0-10 severity), the
PROMIS Physical Function 4a v1.0 scale,11,12 the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale,11,12 and the
PHQ-8.13 Patient-reported data during COVID-19 included immunosuppressant drug use,
COVID-19 positive test status, financial resource adequacy (Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau Financial Well-Being Scale16), and anxiety and depression symptoms. Details are
available in the study protocol.

Anxiety Symptoms. The PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 scale11,12 includes 4 items asking
participants, in the past 7 days, how often: (1) “I felt fearful”; (2) “I found it hard to focus on
anything other than my anxiety”; (3) “My worries overwhelmed me”; and (4) “I felt uneasy”. Items
are scored 1-5 with response options “never” to “always”. Higher scores represent more anxiety.
Raw scores are converted into T-scores standardized from the general US population (mean =
50, standard deviation = 10). A change of 4.0 T-score points was selected to represent the
MCID17 and a threshold for identifying people with at least moderate symptoms of T-score ≥
60.11 PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 has been validated in SSc18,19 and is included in all 3-month
SPIN Cohort assessments.
Depressive Symptoms. The eight-item PHQ-813 measures depressive symptoms over the
last 2 weeks with item scores from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day) and higher scores
representing more depression. The MCID has been estimated to be 3.0 points,20 and a
threshold of ≥ 10 is commonly used to identify people who may have depression.21 The PHQ-8,
which is assessed every 6 months in the SPIN Cohort, performs equivalently to the PHQ-9,22
which has been shown to be valid in SSc.23
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics are presented as mean (standard deviation) for continuous variables
and numbers (percentages) for categorical variables. Changes in anxiety and depression
symptoms were described: (1) continuously with T-scores or raw scores, in terms of MCIDs, and
with a Hedges g standardized mean difference effect size, all with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs); (2) as the proportion of participants whose symptoms worsened or improved, separately,
by at least 1 MCID, with 95% CIs; and (3) as the proportion initially below a T-score of 60 on the
PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.012 or a score of 10 on the PHQ-822 who increased by at least 1 MCID
and reached the threshold score, with 95% CIs. For proportions, 95% CIs were generated
based on Agresti and Coull’s approximate method for binomial proportions.24

We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses for symptom changes. First, for both
anxiety and depressive symptoms, we compared change to scores from assessments done
between January 1 and June 30, 2019 in order to determine if seasonal variations may have
influenced our main findings. Second, since the PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 is administered in the
SPIN Cohort every 3 months and the PHQ-8 every 6 months, to evaluate whether differences in
change between anxiety and depression symptoms may have been due to different assessment
points between July 1 and December 31, 2019, we evaluated changes only including
assessments done at the same timepoint.
We evaluated the association of sociodemographic characteristics, medical
characteristics, and COVID-19 variables with continuous changes in anxiety and depression
symptoms via multivariable linear regression and with a change of ≥1 MCID with multivariable
logistic regression. All variables were selected a priori and entered simultaneously. For
continuous variables, we assessed linearity via restricted cubic splines. Missing data were dealt
with using multiple imputation via chained equations with 20 imputations. Variables entered in
models included male sex (reference female), age (continuous), non-White race or ethnicity
(reference White), education years (continuous), living alone (reference living with others),
country (reference France), working part- or full-time (reference not working), time since SSc
diagnosis (continuous), diffuse subtype (reference limited or sine scleroderma), interstitial lung
disease presence, interference from breathing problems (continuous), overweight or obese
(reference normal body mass index or less), overlap syndrome presence, PROMIS Physical
Function 4a v1.0 (continuous), immunosuppressant drug use presence, use of mental health
services pre-COVID, and financial resource adequacy (continuous).
All analyses were conducted using Stata (Version 13) with 2-sided statistical tests and p <
0.05 significance level.

Changes included exclusion of participants from Australia, because only 10 would have
been eligible; removal of COVID-19 infection from model covariates, since only 4 participants
reported a positive test; and addition of sensitivity analyses.

RESULTS
Participants
There were 435 SPIN Cohort participants from Canada (N = 98), France (N = 159), the
United Kingdom (N = 50), and the United States (N = 128) who enrolled in the SPIN COVID-19
Cohort and were included in the present study. See Figure 1 for participant flow and
Supplementary Table 1 for number of participants from recruitment sites. Table 1 shows
participant characteristics. Mean age was 56.9 years, and 88.5% of participants were female.
Mean time since SSc diagnosis was 12.1 years; 39.8% had diffuse disease subtype, 35.2% had
interstitial lung disease, and 48.1% were using immunosuppressant drugs. Participant
characteristics were similar for most variables across countries.
Comparison of Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Prior to and During COVID-19
As shown in Table 2, anxiety symptoms increased more than a full MCID (4.9 points, 95%
CI 4.0 to 5.7). Increases by country were 3.1 points (95% CI 1.7 to 4.6) for France, 4.4 points for
Canada (95% CI 2.7 to 6.0), 6.2 points for the United Kingdom (95% CI 4.0 to 8.3), and 6.9
points for the United States (95% CI 5.4 to 8.5). The percentage of participants with ³ 1 MCID
increase was 42.8% (95% CI 35.3% to 50.5%) for France, 46.9% for Canada (95% CI 37.4% to
56.7%), 59.4% (95% CI 50.7% to 67.5%) for the United States, and 64.0% (95% CI 50.1% to
75.9%) for the United Kingdom. A similar increase in anxiety was seen compared to pre-COVID-

19 anxiety symptoms assessed January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 (N = 392; see Supplementary
Table 2).
As shown in Table 3, among 388 participants who completed the PHQ-8 in the last 6
months of 2019, changes in depressive symptoms were minimal (reduction of 0.3 points, 95%
CI -0.7 to 0.2). As shown in Supplementary Table 2, this result was unchanged when including
only assessments done on the same day as the included PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0
assessments (N = 223) and compared to results from assessments done in the first 6 months of
2019 (N = 352).
Multivariable Analysis of Factors Associated with Symptom Changes
As shown in Table 4, in adjusted analyses, compared to France, continuous scores for
participants from the United States and the United Kingdom were 3.8 points (95% CI 1.7 to 5.9)
and 2.9 points higher (95% CI 0.0 to 5.7); scores for Canada were higher but not statistically
significant. Change scores were also significantly associated with pre-COVID PROMIS Physical
Function 4a v1.0 scores and pre-COVID mental health service use; participants with preCOVID-19 mental health service use had adjusted scores 3.7 points (95% CI 5.7 to 1.7) lower
than other participants. Results were similar for odds of increasing by ³ 1 MCID. Odds were
approximately twice as high for participants from the United Kingdom (odds ratio 2.0, 95% CI
1.0 to 4.2) and United States (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.2) compared to France. Longer
time since SSc diagnosis and overweight were also statistically significant. See Table 5.
Only country was statistically significantly associated with change in continuous
depressive symptom scores; compared to participants from France, participants from Canada
scored 1.5 points higher (95% CI 0.3 to 2.7), from the United Kingdom 1.8 points higher (95% CI
0.6 to 3.0), and from the United States 2.1 points higher (95% CI 0.5 to 3.7). See
Supplementary Table 3. The odds ratio of an increase of ³ 1 MCID was between 1.9 and 2.5 for

the three countries, but only statistically significant for the United Kingdom (2.5, 95% CI 1.0 to
6.2). No other variables were statistically significant (Supplementary Table 4).
DISCUSSION
We found that anxiety symptoms increased substantially compared to before the COVID19 pandemic among vulnerable persons with a pre-existing medical condition, SSc, whereas
depressive symptom changes were minimal. Overall, mean change on the PROMIS Anxiety 4a
v1.0 was 4.9 points, greater than the MCID of 4 points. Approximately 50% of participants
experienced an increase of ³ 1 MCID. Results differed, however, by country. Anxiety symptoms
increased by approximately 3 points among participants from France, 4 points among
participants from Canada, 6 points among participants from the United Kingdom, and 7 points
among participants from the United States. In multivariable analysis, compared to France,
participants from the United Kingdom and United States scored approximately 3 and 4 points
higher. Participants from the United Kingdom and the United States were also approximately
twice as likely to have increased by ³ 1 MCID, although this was not statistically significant for
the United Kingdom. Another important finding was that people who used mental health
services in the 3 months prior to their pre-COVID-19 assessment had adjusted anxiety symptom
increases almost 4 points less than other participants.
Our study is one of the first to report mental health symptom changes during COVID-19 in
a vulnerable population with a pre-existing medical condition and the first to compare symptom
changes across countries. Compared to studies of university students, which suggest that
depressive symptoms have increased by a small amount and anxiety minimally or not at all,3,6
we found that depressive symptoms changed minimally, but anxiety symptoms, on average,
increased substantially. This may relate to the differential effect that COVID-19 is having on
different segments of the population. University students may primarily be experiencing
consequences of public health interventions, including interruption of academic programs, loss

of work to support their studies, and reduced social connectedness. People with SSc and others
with pre-existing medical conditions who are at risk of severe complications or death if infected
likely perceive a greater threat from the virus than young adults of university age.
Increases in anxiety were larger in the United Kingdom and United States than in Canada
and France. Comparing across countries is fraught with complexities. Nonetheless, the
magnitude of the differences we found were surprisingly large. One possible explanation may
relate to the coherence, or lack of coherence, of governmental and civil responses in the
countries we studied. Indeed, editorials in the Lancet have described the American response as
“inconsistent and incoherent”25 and the UK’s national response as “astonishingly haphazard.”26
France undertook some of the most restrictive measures internationally to attempt to reduce the
spread of the virus,27 which may have reduced fear, relatively, among people vulnerable due to
medical conditions. Canadian provinces were somewhat less restrictive but were generally
consistent with a high level of political consensus on measures that have been taken.28
An important finding was that people who were using mental health services pre-COVID19 had anxiety symptom change scores almost 1 MCID less than other participants. We do not
know of evidence that people who have received mental health treatments are more resilient to
adversity, meaning that they are able to adapt more successfully to negative or stressful
situations. However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that psychological
interventions designed to increase resilience do increase self-reported resilience.29 Many
treatments for common mental illnesses include developing skills in structuring time, increasing
the use of positive coping strategies, staying active even when not motivated, managing stress,
and restructuring negatively distorted thought patterns, all of which would help to manage
anxiety during a crisis like COVID-19.
There are limitations to consider. First, the SPIN Cohort is a convenience sample,
although participant characteristics are similar to other large SSc cohorts.8 Second, participants
complete questionnaires online, which may reduce generalizability. Third, it was not possible to

capture and include local variables, such as the degree participants’ communities were affected
or whether public health interventions were consistently followed in those communities.
Nonetheless, data were collected at a time when social isolations were generally at their most
conservative. Finally, different MCID values may be chosen. The 4-point MCID we used for
anxiety symptoms was conservative; others have recommended MCIDs of 2 to 3 points,30 and it
is possible that we may have underestimated the degree of patient-important change.
In sum, this was the first study to compare mental health symptoms prior to and during the
COVID-19 outbreak. We found that anxiety symptoms increased substantially and that the
magnitude was associated with country; increases were highest in the United States and United
Kingdom and more moderate in France and Canada. There were minimal differences in
depressive symptoms during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19. An important finding was
that people who received mental health care prior to COVID-19 experienced substantially
smaller anxiety symptom increases than other participants. These findings, which differ from
early reports of results from younger adults, underline that people at risk from medical
complications in COVID-19 are also at risk of mental health problems and that there is a need
for accessible mental health interventions that are designed to meet the specific needs of
different populations.
