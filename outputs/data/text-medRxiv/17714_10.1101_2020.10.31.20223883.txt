Abstract

Background: While there was a lack of pharmacological interventions proven to be
effective in early, outpatient settings for COVID-19, in a prospective, open-label
observational study (pre-AndroCoV Trial) the use of nitazoxanide, ivermectin and
hydroxychloroquine demonstrated similar effects, and apparent improvement of
outcomes compared to untreated patients. The unexpected apparent positive results led to
ethical questions on the employment of further full placebo-control studies in early stage
COVID-19. The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether the conduction
of a full placebo-control RCT was still ethically viable, through a comparative analysis
with two control-groups.
Materials and methods: Active group (AG) consisted of mild-to-moderate early stage
COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Pre AndroCoV-Trial, treated with nitazoxanide
ivermectin, or hydroxychloroquine in selected cases, in association with azithromycin.
Vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants, when clinically
recommended. Control Group 1 (CG1) consisted of a retrospectively obtained group of
untreated patients from the same population as those from the Pre-AndroCoV Trial, and
Control Group 2 (CG2) resulted from a precise prediction of clinical outcomes, based on
a thorough and structured review of articles indexed in PubMed and MEDLINE and
statements by official government agencies and specific medical societies. For both CGs,
patients were matched for proportion between sex, age, obesity and other comorbidities.
Results: Compared to CG1 and CG2, AG showed a reduction of 31.5 to 36.5% in viral
shedding (p < 0.0001), 70 to 85% and 70 to 73% in duration of COVID-19 clinical
symptoms when including and not including anosmia and ageusia, respectively ((p <
0.0001 for both), and 100% in respiratory complications through the parameters of the
Brescia COVID-19 Respiratory Scale (p < 0.0001). For every 1,000 confirmed cases for
COVID-19, a minimum of 140 patients were prevented from hospitalization (p < 0.0001),
50 from mechanical ventilation, and five deaths, when comparing to age-, sex- and
comorbidity-matched non-treated patients with similar initial disease severity at the
moment of diagnosis.
Conclusion: Apparent benefits of the combination between early detection and early
pharmacological approaches for COVID-19 demonstrated to be consistent when when

compared to different control groups of untreated patients. The potential benefits could
allow a large number of patients prevented from hospitalizations, deaths and persistent
symptoms after COVID-19 remission. The potential impact on COVID-19 disease course
and numbers of negative outcomes and the well-established safety profile of the drugs
proposed by the Pre-AndroCoV Trial led to ethical questions regarding the conduction of
further placebo control randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for early COVID-19. Early
pharmacological approaches including azithromycin in combination with any of the
options between nitazoxanide, ivermectin or optionally hydroxychloroquine should be
considered for those diagnosed with COVID-19 presenting less than seven days of
symptoms. Of the three drugs, we opted for nitazoxanide, due to more extensive
demonstration of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity, proven efficacy against other
viruses in humans, and steadier safety profile.

Background
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly heterogeneous and multisystemic infection caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), first described in November 2019 in Wuhan, China, and further spread
worldwide, leading to a non-ceasing pandemic since March 2020 (1-3). The key reasons
that may justify the inability to contain its dissemination are based on the some of the
specific properties of SARS-CoV-2, including prolonged incubation and viral shedding,
large percentage of non-symptomatic (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) subjects
actively transmitting SARS-CoV-2, persistent survival in surfaces, and highly spreader
environments (1,2). In addition, its transmission and dissemination patterns are yet to be
fully elucidated (2,3).
Natural course of COVID-19 includes dry couch and rhinorrhea as the prodromic
symptoms, possibly indicating direct viral infection by the oral and nasal mucosa
retrospectively, followed by feverish, chills, arthralgia, muscle soreness, fatigue,
gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tract-related symptoms, and finally followed by
fever, anosmia, ageusia and shortness of brief, later during the first stage. Risk factors

include aging (above 60 y/o), uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and
hyperandrogenic state, in both males and females (4-11).
The current understanding of COVID-19 natural course allows the disease to be
divided into three stages. The first stage corresponds to the viral replication and has an
approximate duration of seven to ten days. The first stage progressively progresses to a
second stage, when inflammatory, immunologic and vascular overreactions occur,
eventually leading to a diffuse lung injury, the third stage. The second and third stages
are highly variable among individuals and are the actual drivers of COVID-19 severity.
The identification of effective treatments to improve COVID-19 clinical
outcomes, mortality and post-COVID manifestations is highly desired while definitive
solutions like effective and safe vaccines are not universally available. Targets that
address SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of infection and risk factors allow proposals of more
precise therapies to be potentially effective against COVID-19. From the understanding
of COVID-19, pharmacological interventions during the first stage are likely the most
efficient timing to prevent complications triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and the most relevant
window of opportunity to antagonize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Direct or indirect antiviral
strategies include acute inhibition of ACE2 attached to cell surfaces, the only direct
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, increase of circulating ACE2, since it may
preclude viral infectivity by coupling with SARS-CoV-2, preventing its entry into cells,
and inhibition of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS-2), a critical protein that
facilitates viral entry through ACE2 (12-21). Repurposing existing drugs may present
some advantages over novel molecules, including well-established safety profile, known
risks and contraindications, familiarity among health providers, and favorable costeffectiveness, in case efficacy for COVID-19 is demonstrated (2;22-29).
Controversies regarding treatment during early (first stage) COVID-19 include
supposed lack of a pharmacological option with clear benefits. Hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), nitazoxanide (NIT) and ivermectin (IVE), in association with azithromycin
(AZI), are popular drugs largely used as off label therapies for COVID-19, that have
demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity and preliminary observational reports as being
beneficial against COVID-19, when used until seven days after beginning of symptoms,
before respiratory complications and hospitalization (26-40). Use of any of these drugs

further in the disease, during second and third stages, have not demonstrated benefits or
conflicting findings (2;30).
Antiandrogens could play a protective action against COVID-19 by the inhibition
of TMPRSS-2 expression, that finds in androgens its only known modulators (2;9-11;4143). Indeed, chronic dutasteride users have demonstrated to protect against severe
COVID-19 in a variety of male populations (44-46), which encourages the employment
of antiandrogens in clinical trials for early COVID-19.
The present group hypothesized that none of the most popular drugs, including HCQ,
NIT and IVE, would result in actual benefits in any stage of COVID-19. While we were
designing our randomized clinical trial (RCT), our primary objective was to compare
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), nitazoxanide (NIT) and ivermectin (IVE) through a
randomized prospective open-label observational study to detect superiority or noninferiority, from which we would choose one drug to compare with antiandrogens,
including spironolactone (SPIRO), dutasteride (DUTA) and proxalutamide (PROXA),
that were our primary hypothesis as possibly being the target to actually demonstrate
antiviral effects, with consequent improvements in clinical outcomes, in a placebocontrol double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) (47-49).
However, during the observational study, we statistically noticed that besides
disclosing similar clinical outcomes between them, HCQ, NIT and IVE apparently
demonstrated better outcomes than those expected for COVID-19. The unexpected
apparent positive results forced us to question whether the employment of full placebocontrol studies in early stage COVID-19 would still be ethically acceptable. Figure 1
summarizes the path towards the ethical questions on the use of placebo in early COVID19 patients.
The objective of the present study was elucidate whether the conduction of a full
placebo-control RCT was still viable from an ethical perspective, through two
independent comparative analysis of the present findings, with two control-groups: one
of local patients with COVID-19 with similar characteristics that either refused or were
not offered therapy, since the standard of care did not require early treatments during the
period that these patients had COVID-19, and the other one of expected and estimated

outcomes based on data generated from a thorough, structured review of the literature.
We aimed to evaluate whether differences were actual, their social repercussions, and if
these discrepancies were irrefutable, leading to mandatory changes in the design of
further RCTs on early COVID-19, by the exclusion of placebo groups.

Materials and methods

Subject selection for the Active Group (AG)

Patients for the Active Group (AG) were recruited through social media, group
messages and various types of medical centers located in Brasilia, Brazil, in case of
suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Suspected cases for COVID-19 were defined as
presenting any specific or unspecific symptom among upper respiratory tract,
musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular systems, from which
fever, shortness of breath, anosmia or ageusia were not sine-quo-non manifestations.
These cases were submitted to a rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2
Assay, Abbott, USA; or Cobas SARS-CoV-2, Roche, Switzerland), from which those
confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 were checked for inclusion criteria and included if criteria
were met. Patients previously confirmed for COVID-19 underwent directly the inclusion
criteria, and were included if criteria were fulfilled.
Once patients were confirmed for COVID-19, inclusion criteria included: 1.
Above 18 years old; 2. Less than seven days since the beginning of symptoms and 72
hours since the diagnosis of COVID-19; 3. Lack of use of the following drugs for more
than 48 hours, including hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, ivermectin or any
glucocorticoid regimen, 4. Lack of clinical or radiological signs of complications related
to COVID-19 or in its second or third stage. Uncompensated shortness of breath, median
oxygen saturation (SatO2) lower than 92% in the last six hours and more than 50% of
lungs affected in a chest computed tomography (CT) scan were criteria for exclusion and
referral to a hospital.
Patients that fulfilled criteria for the observational study consented in a formal
written manner exactly as determined by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the
Ethics Committee of the National Board of Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health,
Brazil (CEP/CONEP: Parecer 4.173.074 / CAAE: 34110420.2.0000.0008). The RCT

Control Groups (CGs)

Two control-groups based on comparative analysis were employed, in order to
find consistency and reproducibility of the data with Control Groups 1 and 2, respectively.
All data was adjusted for age, sex, and presence of comorbidities.
Control Group 1 (CG1) is a group of paired untreated patients randomly obtained
retrospectively from the population of the same community that had confirmed diagnosis
of COVID-19 during the same period of those included in the Pre-AndroCoV Trial. i.e.,
that presented COVID-19 alongside patients included in the present observational study,
that either refused or were not offered a treatment with any drug between nitazoxanide,
hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. Patients were enrolled from a variety of sources,
including those that were provided supportive medical standard of care for COVID-19
from the same institute that conducted the observational study, and were also obtained
retrospectively in a structured manner from different private medical centers that
followed up patients during COVID-19, located locally, whereas those already
hospitalized at the time of recruitment or referred by hospitals were excluded, in order to
avoid overestimation of hospitalization and other complication rates in untreated patients.
A second control group (Control Group 2 - CG2) resulted from a precise
estimation based on a thorough and structured review of articles indexed in PubMed and
MEDLINE, and statements by official government agencies and specific medical
societies (50-84). From data obtained, each parameter was estimated for range, median
and consistency. From the most consistent values and ranges, the least negative data was
employed when results were unsimilar (above 20% of discrepancy between data), or the
median adjusted for one standard deviation (SD) in favor of positive outcomes was
employed when results were less variable, i.e., when differences were lower than 20% for
a same parameter between different studies. Particularly, when data had heterogeneity
above 100% of difference between them, only the range of the data was described (e.g.,
if for a specific symptom, prevalence was described as being between 10% and 80%,
10%-80% was described), while the least negative value was employed for comparison
purposes.

Patient characterization

Patients were characterized for age, sex, prevalence of obesity, hypertension, type
2 diabetes mellitus, overall comorbidities rate, and adjusted accordingly. AC were
additionally characterized for the presence of other 35 diseases and 20 drug classes.

Procedures
Only patients from AC underwent early specific pharmacological approaches
based on the literature or as per the Brazilian Ministry of Health, including azithromycin
500mg daily for five days for all patients, in association with one of the following:
hydroxychloroquine 400mg daily for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six
days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day in a single daily dose for three days. Dutasteride,
spironolactone, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, apibaxan, rivaroxaban, enoxaparin, and
glucocorticoids were added according to clinical judgement and risk for thrombosis and
progression to inflammatory stage. The choice between hydroxychloroquine,
nitazoxanide, and/or ivermectin, as well as the optional use dutasteride, spironolactone
(if applicable) and any other drug or supplement was based on clinical judgement,
availability, and individual medical history, in a quasi-randomized manner.

Parameters
Major clinical course, outcomes and endpoints were measured or calculated for
all groups, including viral shedding using rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott RealTime SARSCoV-2 Assay, Abbott, USA; or Cobas SARS-CoV-2, Roche, Switzerland), remission of
symptoms related to acute COVID-19 not including and including anosmia and ageusia,
percentage of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and deaths, and presence of mental
or physical post-COVID symptoms.
Duration of positive rtPCT-SARS-CoV-2 and clinical remission not including and
including anosmia and ageusia were directly obtained from patients of AG and CG1,
while estimated from the extensive descriptions in the literature for CG2. Remission of
CG2 was based on data from outpatients of similar age and other characteristics
presenting mild disease. The median duration of dry cough, the most prolonged symptom

excluding anosmia, ageusia, was the driver of the clinical duration without anosmia and
ageusia, while duration of anosmia and ageusia were estimated less precisely, since there
is inconsistent data regarding their duration, and they seem to vary widely among infected
individuals.
Percentage of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and deaths were directly
obtained from AC and CG1, while for CG2 these parameters were determined from the
proportion between rates for those aged between 40 and 49 y/o with and without
comorbidities, since presence of comorbidities was associated with up to 12 times higher
complication and mortality rates. We assumed a prevalence of comorbidities of 20%
among patients of the present study when calculating expected outcomes in order to avoid
overestimation of expected rates of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and deaths,
and consequently avoid overestimation of prevented clinical outcomes. i.e., potential
benefits of early pharmacological approaches to COVID-19.
Presence of physical, mental and overall persistency of symptoms after COVID19 remission was determined from AC and CG1, and estimated from CG2, although data
on post-COVID related symptoms are still inconsistent.
Clinical course was based on percentage and median duration of each of major
symptoms, median time-to-progression to more severe states, and time spent in each of
these complications, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU), non-invasive
oxygen regimens, mechanical ventilation, pressors, and death, and was evaluated for
Days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60. Accordingly, WHO COVID Ordinal Outcomes was
employed aiming to quantify clinical status, and was evaluated in Days 0, 7, 14, 30 and
60.
Level of certainty for each parameter was described as being 0 (not certain at all)
to 10 (extremely certain), according to the level of precision of the data obtained for each
specific parameter, for comparative analysis purposes. CG1 and CG2 underwent pairwise
comparative analysis to evaluate consistency between world data and data generated from
the local untreated population.

Control Group 1 was not evaluated for symptoms due to insufficient accuracy
regarding the description of each symptom for this population. Likewise, for all other
parameters, only those for which data was sufficiently described, with minimally
consisting findings between different studies, were included.
We avoided statistical analyses from regions with higher case fatality ratio (CFR),
as those observed in Northern Italy (69), as this could artificially increase the estimation
of the number of preventable COVID-19 related complications.
Patients that were initially mild or moderate and therefore eligible for the study
but required further hospitalization due to progression to more severe states were referred
to an emergency unit and followed together with the hospital team.
Amplitude effect – estimated number of preventable outcomes
Considering the presence of an exceeding number of patients that likely prevented
hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and post-COVID syndrome in the treated
group, we also calculated estimates for number of patients that were prevented to progress
to any of these outcomes. In order to avoid overestimation of potential preventable
outcomes we assumed that our ability to diagnose COVID-19 during earlier stages was
at least twice as higher as for overall population, leading to reduction of predicted
complications.

Statistical analysis
Full raw data for AC and CG1 is available at a public repository
(https://osf.io/cm4f8/). Sample size was determined based on the assumptions thatits
estimate for the chi-squared test would require 80% power to detect the difference in
proportions at p = 0.05, at least 95% of subjects would complete the study, and
hospitalization and death rates being between 3 and 20%, and 0.3 and 2.5%, respectively.
From these assumptions, we calculated a minimum of 45 and 125 patients for each
subjects to detect safety and efficacy differences, respectively, that could justify its early
termination.

Nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) with adjusted Dunn’s test for pairwise
analyses when overall p < 0.05, assuming that all parameters were distributed nonnormally. All statistical tests were performed using XLSTAT version 22.4.1 (Microsoft,
USA).

Results

Baseline characteristics of the present study are similar between treated (AG) and
untreated patients (CG1 and CG2), and similar to than those of the literature, except for
the higher prevalence of obesity in CG2 versus CG1 and treated population, while
prevalence was CG1 and treated population. There was numerically lower presence of
hypertension and T2DM in CG2, and comorbidities in both CG1 and CG2, compared to
treated population (Table 1). CG1 did not require adjustments for age, sex, obesity and
other comorbidities, as they presented similar characteristics than treated population.
Table 2 describes the prevalence of major symptoms in COVID-19. Fever,
shortness of breath, dry cough and fatigue were significantly less present in the
participants of the pre-AndroCoV Trial compared to general population (CG2), while
diarrhea and headache were more present in the present study. There was insufficient
accurate data on age-adjusted prevalence of “feverish”, rhinorrhea, self-reported
“sinusitis”, dizziness, weakness, arthralgia, thoracic, upper back and lower back pain,
vomiting alone, conjunctival hyperemia, pre-orbital pain, and dry eyes and mouth.
Main clinical outcomes are summarized in Table 3. Duration of positive rtPCRSARS-CoV-2 was 36.5% and 31.5% lower in AG compared to CG1 and CG2,
respectively (p < 0.0001 for both), duration of clinical manifestations was reduced by
70% to 73% not including anosmia and ageusia, and 70% to 85% including both (p <
0.0001 for both), and demonstrated ability to prevent between 140 and 197
hospitalizations, 50 to 66 patients needing mechanical ventilation, five to 14 deaths, and
404 to 875 patients persisting with post-COVID symptoms, for every 1,000 cases (<

0.0001, except for mechanical ventilation and death when unadjusted, although < 0.0001
when adjusted for population models).
Regarding clinical course of COVID-19, Days 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 showed
significantly more rapid improvement rates in the population treated in the preAndroCoV Trial than CG1 and CG2 (p < 0.0001, except for Day 14 – p – 0.033) (Table
4). In the WHO COVID Ordinal Outcomes (Table 5), treated patients were significantly
better than untreated (CG1 and CG2) in Days 7, 14 and 30.
CG1 and CG2 presented similar characteristics and disease parameters, except for
obesity prevalence (CG1 > CG2) and slightly lower number of patients in Stage 1 on Day
7 of the WHO COVID Ordinary Outcomes.

Discussion

Superiority of early pharmacological interventions for COVID-19: apparent or
actual?
When we conducted the observational study comparing HCQ, NIT and IVE, we
presumed that there were no actual effective options for early COVID-19, i.e., that none
of the drugs would confer any protection. As per the design, we did not include patients
that did not undergo any specific treatment, since our primary objective was to perform a
head-to-head comparison. However, once none of the patients were hospitalized, needed
mechanical ventilation, or deceased, questions regarding the superiority of any treatment
over none were raised, but could be answered within the study per se, as we did not
originally include untreated patients, precluding us from any conclusion regarding the
overall efficacy.
When we detected an apparent superiority in terms of efficacy for HCQ, NIT and
IVE, this was still speculative, and was not the primary endpoint of the open-label
randomized prospective observational study. To respond to this question raised by the

clear differences between our treated and overall untreated populations, we performed the
present comparative analysis based in two different control-groups, in order to detect
reproducibility and consistency between both comparisons.
However, the shortage of a thorough characterization of clinical manifestations during
early COVID-19 due to a large variability of symptoms and inability to detect COVID19 in the first days of symptoms, and the substantial variability in the prevalence of
symptoms reported, possibly due to methodological differences in the search for
manifestations was a barrier for a precise comparative analysis.
Despite the limitations for a precise characterization of early COVID-19, associated
with the fact that for ethical reasons differences were underestimated, the present
comparative analysis revealed differences unlikely to be random for the most relevant
clinical outcomes, with potential ability to prevent a non-negligible number of
hospitalizations, mechanical ventilations, and deaths. The analysis disclosed approximate
reductions of one third in viral shedding, two thirds in clinical duration, and 100%
prevention of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and deaths, when compared to both
CG-1 and CG-2, together and separately, which were shown to represent substantial and
possibly conclusive improvements regarding the benefits, when using one of the three
pharmacological interventions in early stage COVID-19, at least in when combined with
azithromycin, and in majority of the cases, zinc, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Since the median age was below 60 y/o and the prevalence of less than 20% and 30%
of obesity and comorbidities, respectively , and COVID-19 related complications are
highly correlated with risk factors, in an exponential manner with aging, the ability to
detect differences in lower risk populations allow us hypothesize that in higher-risk
groups of patients infected by COVID-19 would potentially lead to more substantial
differences due to the larger number of complication events, allowing more visible
distinctions between groups, although this is yet to be determined.
Besides the consistent findings between comparisons of AG with CG1 and CG2, CG1
and CG2 presented similar results for virtually all parameters and outcomes, providing
further consistency and strength in the findings and estimates for untreated patients.

Avoiding overestimation of benefits from early pharmacological approaches to
COVID-19
One challenge when comparing research data with external or retrospective
analysis of populations, not initially included and not encompassed by the primary
objectives, is to avoid authors’ bias of overestimating their findings, in particular in the
context of the demonstration of efficacy of potential major public and social relevance.
To overcome this potential bias, we purposely adjusted all parameters towards to
underestimation of risks, complications and negative data on untreated populations, and
underestimation of benefits among those treated for COVID-19.
Two major tools were employed to avoid overestimation of our findings: 1. The
use of two independent control-groups, one of similar population, and the other one based
on the literature, and 2. Extrapolative underestimation of COVID-19 negative outcomes
and data.
The CG1 is based on a local population with similar age, proportion between sex,
ethnic, socioeconomic and cultural characteristics, aiming to avoid differences due to
health disparities.
For the estimation of the CG2, we have considered slightly lower disease duration,
hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death and post-COVID rates than those described
by the literature. In particular, we avoided the use of studies that included hospitalized
patients, even for evaluation of disease duration, even in a proportion of patients that were
expected to be hospitalized, since we tended to underestimate the risks of untreated and
overestimate our negative findings.
Although patients from the AG were detected in the early COVID-19 stage, they
cannot be considered as non-critical, but uncertain cases. However, although patients had
uncertain clinical course, for comparative purposes we avoided the use of data from
critical untreated patients, and from non-critical cases instead, leading to lower negative
outcomes in the estimation of untreated patients. In addition, while median age of the

present population corresponded to the median age of majority of studies with
hospitalized patients, we excluded studies that had higher median age since these studies
could overestimate risks related to COVID-19 inherent to aging.
Noteworthy, mortality rates below 0.5% were only obtained through the analysis
of seroprevalence compared to number of deaths in a specific population at a specific
time, which concurrently demonstrates that asymptomatic patients represent over 80% of
those infected by COVID-19. Since our study only had fewer than 15% of patients being
asymptomatic, our comparisons with mortality rates should be based on CFR of
populations that presented positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 due to symptoms or direct
contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Particularities of the present study
Some specificities of the pre-AndroCoV Trial may have contributed for the
characteristic profile of the studied population and notably improved outcomes.
Possibly because we have actively searched for comorbidities that could influence
risks in COVID-19, our prevalence of comorbidities was higher compared to sex- and
age-matched untreated populations, even with lower BMI (when compared to CG2, but
no CG1), which could have negatively influenced outcomes in the AG, although
underdiagnosis of comorbidities in CG2 is possible.
The potential protectives role of statins, metformin, ACEi and ARB for COVID19, which was regularly used by approximately 30% of the AG, may have contributed to
milder COVID-19 presentation in the AG.
In addition, the non-mandatory presence of fever, shortness of breath or cough to
be considered as suspected for COVID-19 may have apparently changed the profile of
clinical manifestations. The active search for symptoms resulted in higher prevalence of
anosmia and ageusia when compared to literature

Whether and until which extent the change in COVID-19 detection towards a
more sensitive diagnosis may have affected outcomes in a positive manner is unknown,
but possible. Correspondingly, a more aggressive approach to the patient suspected for
COVID-19 may have been crucial for the better outcomes found in the AG, when
compared CGs.

Post-COVID syndrome as an outcome

While mortality plays a key outcome in COVID-19, the notorious presence of
persisting symptoms after COVID-19 remission has called attention to the chronic
aspects, possibly mediated by the triggering of immunologic maladaptations. Persistent
fatigue, brain fog, reduction of cognitive functions, impaired muscle recovery, decreased
physical capacity, reduced fertility and sexual function, and psychiatric manifestations
not fully justified by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with substantial similarities
with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Burnout syndrome, are among the most
commonly described symptoms, and may affect up to 85% of patients (85-93). Because
of the potential long-term impairment of life quality, prevention of post-COVID
symptoms should be considered as a major endpoint when approaching COVID-19.
In the present study, differences in the prevalence of post-COVID symptoms
between treated and untreated populations were larger than differences in any other
parameter. This finding must be emphasized as an additional benefit that may overcome
potential risks of the drugs uses per se, i.e., even in a hypothetical absence of other
benefits, prevention of post-COVID syndrome could be alone sufficient to justify early
pharmacological approaches to COVID-19.

Estimates of the impact of early pharmacological approaches in COVID-19
clinical outcomes

Estimates for the impact of early pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 have
been overall underestimated in the present analysis, in order to prevent identification of
not actual benefits.
In all scenarios, reduction of deaths and long-term consequences were
meaningful, specially when analyzed through a public health perspective. At least
140,000 hospitalizations, 5,000 deaths and 250,000 long-term persistence of symptomatic
subjects could be prevented for every 1,000,000 cases treated before seven days of
symptoms.
The social and human relevance of these findings are of major importance in terms
of absolute number of prevented complications, while risks related to the drugs proposed
are largely overcome by benefits, particularly in a pandemic with massive number of
cases.

The decision of no longer use of placebo in early COVID-19

Although the employment of placebo-control study design was initially accepted
due to the uncertain risks of development of complications from COVID-19. ethical
issues in the employment of placebo-control studies on COVID-19 were raised after the
overwhelming differences in terms of results. The prevention of hospitalization and
mechanical ventilation in approximately 14% and 5% of patients affected by symptomatic
COVID-19, and the reduction of 90 to 95% of patients developing post-COVID
impairment of life quality are arguments initially against the continuation of full placebocontrol studies for COVID-19, at least in its early stages.
There is not such a specific point from which it becomes ethically questionable to
continue a clinical trial. However, the fact that a placebo control is necessary to
demonstrate efficacy is not sufficient to justify it employment in all circumstances. While
without the knowledge from placebo-control studies it becomes harder to obtain efficacy
data, for life-threatening conditions, from the perspectives of both percentage and
absolute number of affected patients, it would not be ethical to ask participants to accept

known risks in case an unproven but possible and largely safe option could be offered, in
a manner that risks of postponing treatment is not negligible. In summary, the use of safe
options that although unproven demonstrate plausibility and preliminary observational
positive results is highly recommended in the absence of established effective treatments.
When analyzing the use of placebo, the peculiarities of the COVID-19 pandemic
should be highlighted, in particular regarding the social value of early treatment, once
superiority has become evident. In the present particular case, one point that must be
considered is the fact that drugs used for COVID-19 in the present study have solid safety
profile and virtual no risk of serious adverse effects or complications. In common,
hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin have been used for a wide range of
infectious and non-infectious diseases in the long-term, with apparent steady safe profile
and lack of overwhelming risks, when used in large populations, with favorable costeffectiveness, even when used as preventive approaches to low-risk diseases, which
reinforce their safety. Considering that all three molecules have sufficient safety to be
used for lower-risk disorders, even in a preventive basis, it seems intuitive that their use
for early COVID-19, when antiviral approaches tend to be more efficient, would be
recommended, at least until evidence shows otherwise, since risks of complications, death
and chronic symptoms caused by COVID-19 are known, plausibility and preliminary data
exist, and safety is well-established for all three molecules. Also, in the present study,
outcomes between the three drugs were similar, revealing a non-inferiority of any of them
in terms of efficacy. The lack of severe adverse effects and complications also reinforced
their safety profile for COVID-19.
Since respiratory state can decompensate very rapidly, besides being following
closely, the timing to intervention is critical, and early pharmacological approaches
showed to be likely efficient to prevent acute respiratory insufficiency.

The concept of clinical equipoise, although controversial and not universally
accepted, finds its best example on early pharmacological approaches for COVID-19
(100-105). First, it is genuinely uncertain whether this modality could lead to improved
outcomes. Second, the spread off-label use performed before initially required doubleblind placebo-control RCTs. To overcome ethical dilemmas, the initial purpose of

performing a comparative analysis between hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and
ivermectin was to determine whether one of these options would demonstrate superior
efficacy over others, and then employ the drug as a full placebo-control double-blind RCT
together with an antiandrogen (spironolactone, dutasteride and proxalutamide). Hence,
null hypothesis was inherently considered in the beginning.
The lack of a specific threshold of evidence of superiority had not been established
in the beginning, since the primary objective was to determine which of the three drugs
could possibly demonstrate better efficacy while maintaining safety, in addition to the
fact that COVID-19 still had uncertain estimates of complication rates by the time of the
design of the present study, precluding an accurate description of stopping guidelines.
With the unexpected results of lack of progression of lung injury, hospitalization,
mechanical ventilation, death, and as longitudinally analyzed, post-COVID symptoms,
the actual uncertainty as part of the clinical equipoise has clearly become no longer
uncertain, but highly likely instead. Although Interim analysis already precluded
investigators from performing a full placebo-control in the RCT with sufficient evidence
with 390 patients, the bias of investigators as overestimating the benefits of proposed
intervention and the fact that for some clinical equipoise requires overall medical
community to be convinced that findings are consistent, reproduceable and
unquestionable, we maintained until we reached 585 patients, with consistent results
throughout the study.
In the case of the pre-AndroCoV-Trial, research ethics applied to the COVID-19
pandemic, the extreme social value attributed to the unexpected superiority detected in
any pharmacological approach, versus those not treated, the amplitude effects of the
findings, and the estimates on the impacts of the changes towards earlier detection and
prompt pharmacological intervention for COVID-19 allowed us determine that placebo
was no longer needed, and could actually start to affect the therapeutic obligation of
medical providers to offer the now demonstrated efficient therapies for those diagnosed
with COVID-19 until seven days of symptoms. The superiority of the treatment for
COVID-19 has become clearly established in the accruing of comparative treatment
results. Although boundaries for superiority in terms of efficacy tend to be stricter than
those for safety, the superiority has become evident.

As mentioned before, since the present findings were obtained with lower risk
populations, which requires more prominent differences and larger samples, in order to
the superiority in terms of efficacy, the potential benefits for populations of higher risk
will likely be amplified.
Since COVID-19 is of public health importance, and impact of the present
findings is likely large, we were no longer ethically allowed to start or continue placebocontrol RCTs, and we found mandatory to communicate our findings to overall scientific
community.
In summary, the three proposed drugs have strong safety profile, have been long
used for a variety of diseases, have low treatment costs, and may benefit a massive
number of subjects, including the reduction from 60 to 80% of prevalence of prolonged
symptoms after COVID-19 remission to 2.5 to 5% observed in treated patients, use of
placebo for further studies would become harder to be ethically justified. In addition, the
presence of three options allow prescribes to choose, according to medical judgement and
perceptions over safety and efficacy. For the AndroCoV Trial, we opted for the use of
nitazoxanide due to its stronger in vitro evidence, evidence to be effective against other
viruses in humans, and less disputed safety questions. Figure 2 summarizes the rationale
for the conclusions from the present analysis.

Figure 2. Ethics in the employment of full placebo-control RCTs in early COVID-19.

No standardized or proven
therapy for early COVID-19

Placebo-control RCTs in
early COVID-19

Multiple drugs claimed to be
promising against COVID-19

Head-to-head comparison

1. Potential large impact on the
number of preventable
complications, long-term
consequences and deaths

2. Absence of proven
effective therapies for
early stage COVID-19,
while a
non-neglectable
number of patients
are expected to
progress to
more severe states

Choice for existing, overall safe
drugs, with preliminary positive
data for early COVID-19

Drugs used for
low-risk disorders

Drugs (nitazoxanide,
hydroxychloroquine and
ivermectin) work equally,
and apparently better than
untreated COVID-19

Is the employment of full
placebo-control RCTs in
early COVID-19 still
ethically acceptable?

(Arguments)
Related to
the disease

Use as
prophylactic
approach for lowrisk disorders

Only drugs with wellestablished safety profile
and neglectable risks are
eligible to be candidates
for these approaches

1. Strong safety profile and
absence of serious adverse effects

(Arguments)
Related to
the drugs

2. Accessible cost and
favorable costeffectiveness for use
in large scale

3. Mechanistical
plausibility and positive
observational data

3. Despite being a disease with
relative low risk of complications, a
massive number of subjects can be
severely affected, and a massive
number of complications and deaths
can be prevented

Comparative analysis of
the present data with
untreated patients

Two distinct control groups of untreated
patients, for consistency and reproducibility
Underestimating benefits of treatment and
underestimating risks of non-treatment, to
avoid detection of unactual benefits

4. Detection of COVID-19 in earlier stages by
suspecting in case of any upper respiratory tract,
gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal symptom,
instead of the sine-quo-non presence of fever,
dry cough or shortness of breath may
dramatically change disease course

Demonstration of
likely efficacy in all
comparative scenarios

SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO
AVOID PLACEBO-CONTROL RCTs
IN EARLY COVID-19
RCTs = randomized clinical trials

Limitations
This is a post-hoc comparative analysis, combined with a comparison with two
control-groups, one obtained retrospectively and one estimated and expected outcomes
for the population treated for COVID-19, which may only offer evidence in case of the
existence of overwhelming data to justify, while several biases should be considered
when analyzing the present study.

However, the most limiting aspect of the present analysis is to reproduce the
quality of patient recruitment, employment of a sensitive COVID-19 case-detection basis,
turnaround time for rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2, prompt availability to provide pharmacological
intervention, and, above all, availability of health professionals, essay kits, and
treatments, altogether, in a worldwide basis. The feasibility to reproduce the exact same
conditions of the present study in public health is uncertain, unless critical changes in
policies on COVID-19 are considered. Lastly, whether and until which extent each of the
aspects employed in the present analysis would impact COVID-19 outcomes alone is
uncertain.

Conclusion
Patients

treated

with

azithromycin

combined

with

nitazoxanide,

hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin had significant reductions in viral shedding, disease
duration, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death and post-COVID symptoms,
when compared to sex-, age- and comorbidity-matched untreated patients. These
differences remained when benefits of treatment and risks of COVID-19 were both
underestimated. The well-established safety profile of the proposed drugs, the likely
benefits and the current absence of proven therapies for early COVID-19 bring ethical
questions regarding the employment of placebo-control randomized clinical trials in early
COVID-19. Of the three drugs, we opted for nitazoxanide, due to more extensive
demonstration of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity, proven efficacy against other
viruses in humans and steadier safety profile.

HEAD-TO-HEAD
COMPARISONS

Figure 1. Rationale for the ethical questioning on the employment of placebo-control design in RCTs for early COVID-19.

HYPOTHESIS

There is no drug proven to be
effective in early COVID-19

Comparison between three
popular drugs claimed to be
effective, although unproven

OBJECTIVE

Detect non-inferiority or
superiority when comparing HCG,
NIT and IVE

Choose the drug for the placebocontrol double-blind RCT with
antiandrogens

FINDINGS

All three drugs yielded similar
results

Apparently, outcomes were better
than those expected for COVID-19

BETWEEN TREATED PATIENTS AND
TWO CONTROL-GROUPS OF NONTREATED PATIENTS

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

Unable to demonstrate as a
placebo or untreated groups was
not followed prospectively

RCTs =
randomized
clinical trials

NEW HYPOTHESIS

NEW OBJECTIVE

FINDINGS

Are early pharmacological
intervention indeed effective if
used during early COVID-19?

Comparative analysis to identify
superiority for efficacy

Comparison with two controlgroups: retrospective data
obtained from similar population,
and literature-based predicted
results

Significant reduction of
hospitalization, mechanical
ventilation, death, and postCOVID syndrome, in all
comparative scenarios

Early pharmacological treatment
for COVID-19
likely brings benefits
in terms of clinical outcomes,
regardless of the drug used

SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO QUESTION FURTHER EMPLOYMENT OF
PLACEBO-CONTROL DESIGN RCTs IN EARLY COVID-19, FROM AN ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE

Figure 2. Ethics in the employment of full placebo-control RCTs in early COVID-19.

No standardized or proven
therapy for early COVID-19

Multiple drugs claimed to be
promising against COVID-19

1. Potential large impact on the
number of preventable
complications, long-term
consequences and deaths

2. Absence of proven
effective therapies for
early stage COVID-19,
while a
non-neglectable
number of patients
are expected to
progress to
more severe states

Placebo-control RCTs in
early COVID-19

Choice for existing, overall safe
drugs, with preliminary positive
data for early COVID-19

Head-to-head comparison

Drugs used for
low-risk disorders

Drugs (nitazoxanide,
hydroxychloroquine and
ivermectin) work equally,
and apparently better than
untreated COVID-19

(Arguments)
Related to
the disease

3. Despite being a disease with
relative low risk of complications, a
massive number of subjects can be
severely affected, and a massive
number of complications and deaths
can be prevented

4. Detection of COVID-19 in earlier stages by
suspecting in case of any upper respiratory tract,
gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal symptom,
instead of the sine-quo-non presence of fever,
dry cough or shortness of breath may
dramatically change disease course

Is the employment of full
placebo-control RCTs in
early COVID-19 still
ethically acceptable?

Use as
prophylactic
approach for lowrisk disorders

Only drugs with wellestablished safety profile
and neglectable risks are
eligible to be candidates
for these approaches

1. Strong safety profile and
absence of serious adverse effects

(Arguments)
Related to
the drugs

2. Accessible cost and
favorable costeffectiveness for use
in large scale

3. Mechanistical
plausibility and positive
observational data

Comparative analysis of
the present data with
untreated patients

Two distinct control groups of untreated
patients, for consistency and reproducibility
Underestimating benefits of treatment and
underestimating risks of non-treatment, to
avoid detection of unactual benefits

Demonstration of
likely efficacy in all
comparative scenarios

SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO
AVOID PLACEBO-CONTROL RCTs
IN EARLY COVID-19
RCTs = randomized clinical trials
