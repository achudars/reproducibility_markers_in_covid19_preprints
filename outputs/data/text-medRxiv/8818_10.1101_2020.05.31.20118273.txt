ABSTRACT

Background: Robust serological assays are essential for long-term control of the COVID-19
pandemic. Many recently released point-of-care (PoCT) serological assays have been distributed with
little pre-market validation.

Methods: Performance characteristics for five PoCT lateral flow devices approved for use in
Australia were compared to a commercial enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and a recently described
novel surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT).

Results: Sensitivities for PoCT ranged from 51.8% (95% CI 43.1 to 60.4%) to 67.9% (95% CI 59.475.6%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI 89.2-98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI 96.1-100.0%).
Overall ELISA sensitivity for either IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI 59.4-75.6), increasing
to 93.8% (95% CI 85.0-98.3%) for samples >14 days post symptom onset. Overall, sVNT sensitivity
was 60.9% (95% CI 53.2-68.4%), rising to 91.2%% (95% CI 81.8-96.7%) for samples collected >14
days post-symptom onset, with a specificity 94.4% (95% CI 89.2-97.5%),

Conclusion: Performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays were generally lower than
those reported by manufacturers. Timing of specimen collection relative to onset of illness or
infection is crucial in the reporting of performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays.
The optimal algorithm for implementing serological testing for COVID-19 remains to be determined,
particularly in low-prevalence settings.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health emergency on an unprecedented scale. First
reports in late December 2019 described a cluster of patients with pneumonia, linked to a live animal
market in Wuhan, China (1-3). One of the fundamental pillars in the prevention and control of
COVID-19 is timely, scalable and accurate diagnostic testing. Diagnostic testing plays a critical role
in defining the epidemiology of the disease, informing case and contact management, and ultimately
in reducing viral transmission (4). To date, testing has comprised detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus
using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays, predominantly from patients meeting specific
epidemiological criteria. However, the immense scale of RT-PCR diagnostic testing has placed
extraordinary demands on laboratories, with challenges relating to supply chains of swabs, laboratory
reagents, and the human and financial resource required to support population-level testing.

Over the past two months, there has been rapid development of serological assays for COVID-19 in a
number of countries (5). Serological tests rely on detection of specific anti-viral antibodies (IgM,
IgG, IgA or total antibody) in patient serum, plasma or whole blood. The broad array of serological
tests now available vary both in analytical performance and in their particular utility in the overall
public health response to COVID-19. The most publicised serological tests for COVID-19 have been
lateral flow immunoassays, also known as serological point of care tests (PoCT), which have been
manufactured and deployed in several countries. Most available PoCT involve detection of antiSARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies through binding to immobilised antigen (generally domains of
the spike (S) protein) attached to colloidal gold, followed by detection of the conjugates by an antihuman IgM or IgG antibody. In addition, a control line is usually also included in the assay, which
helps determine whether the test result is valid. The relatively cheap and simple nature of lateral flow
assays means that production is suited to scaling-up for increased testing capacity.

In many countries, including the United States and Australia, the rapid development and
implementation of COVID-19 diagnostics has meant that normally stringent regulatory criteria have
not been applied to all tests, with limited published data supporting assay performance in clinical
settings.

Here, in order to inform the deployment of PoCT in Australia, we compared the

performance characteristics of five commercially available PoCT with (i) a commercially-available
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and (ii) a recently described surrogate virus
neutralisation assay, using samples from: (a) patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19; (b)
patients who were RT-PCR negative but presented with respiratory symptoms during the peak of the
pandemic in Australia, and (c) patients pre-COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS
Clinical samples and patient populations
A testing panel was specifically developed to test PoCT devices for this study (Supplementary
Dataset), consisting of three patient populations: (i) sera from 91 patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected
by RT-PCR from upper and / or lower respiratory tract specimens; (ii) sera from 36 patients with
seasonal coronavirus infections or other acute infections (e.g. dengue; CMV; EBV), and (iii) serum
from a random cohort (56 patients) of the Australian population obtained in 2018.

To further assess specificity, one of the devices (Device 1, for which there was a surplus of tests) was
tested against serum samples from 1,217 patients who were SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative but
presented to a hospital emergency department between 6th February 2020 and 15th April, spanning the
initial peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.

Serum samples were obtained from a large academic hospital in Melbourne, Australia (Royal
Melbourne Hospital, RMH), or the Victorian state reference laboratory for virology (Victorian
Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, VIDRL). Convalescent patients were followed up at home
by the RMH@Home Hospital in the Home (HITH) Team. Information on each cohort is provided in
the Supplementary Dataset.

Cases were classified clinically as mild (not admitted to hospital), moderate (admitted to a hospital
ward, but not the intensive care unit [ICU]) or severe (admitted to ICU). Of the 91 cases, 71 were
mild, 17 were moderate and three were severe.

RT-PCR
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the Coronavirus Typing assay (AusDiagnostics, Mascot,
Australia), a two-step, hemi-nested multiplex tandem PCR, with seven coronavirus RNA targets plus
a proprietary artificial sequence as an internal control. All positive samples underwent additional
confirmatory testing for SARS-CoV-2 at VIDRL, using previously published primers (6).

Serological PoCT
Serological PoCT devices were tested exactly as per the manufacturerâ€™s stated instructions for use
(IFU), including use of plastic droppers and buffers provided in the kits. Devices were provided
through the Australian Government Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), based on their initial
desktop evaluations of assay performance characteristics, and device availability at the time of the
study (Supplementary Table 1). In brief, 10 Î¼L of serum was added to the device, with addition of
between 60 and 100 Î¼L of the manufacturerâ€™s provided buffer. Devices were incubated at room

temperature according to the time period defined in the IFU (generally 10 to 15 minutes). All results
were read as per the IFU. Testing was performed by laboratory technicians, all of whom had
undergone competency training in the use of lateral flow assays. Testing of each sample in the serum
panel was performed in duplicate, with a triplicate deciding test for discordant results. Any faint line
present at test termination was considered a positive result. Results were recorded in a passwordprotected database available only to study investigators. All patient samples were de-identified.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
ELISA testing was performed using a commercially available ELISA (Supplementary Table 1). The
ELISA involves semi-quantitative detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG antibodies in serum
through binding to a recombinant structural antigen (S1 domain of the Spike protein) fixed to reagent
wells. If test sera contain anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a second incubation step using enzymelabelled anti-human IgA or anti-human IgG will catalyse a colour reaction, detected by an optical
density reader. Semiquantitative results were reported as a ratio as per the manufacturerâ€™s IFU and
interpreted as follows (i) ratio <0.8: negative result; (ii) ratio â‰¥0.8 to <1.1: borderline result, and (iii)
ratio â‰¥1.1: positive result. Performance characteristics were determined using the same sera panel as
the PoCT, along with 36 additional samples (33 samples from 19 patients with COVID-19 confirmed
by RT-PCR; 2 samples from MERS-CoV positive patients and 1 serum from a SARS-CoV-1 positive
patient) (Supplementary Dataset).

SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT)
To further assess antibody response, we used a recently described surrogate virus neutralization test
(sVNT), that detects circulating neutralising antibodies in an isotype and species independent manner,
based on antibody-mediated blockage of interaction between the ACE2 receptor protein and the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein (7). In brief, 10 Î¼L of test serum is diluted
with 90 Î¼L of Sample Dilution Buffer and incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated SARSCoV-2 RBD protein (HRP-RBD), and the test solution is added to wells coated with fixed ACE2
receptors. The degree to which test serum inhibits binding of the HRP-RBD to ACE2 receptors,
compared to control serum, is determined by optical density reading, with 20% inhibition and above
considered a positive result. Sera tested in the sVNT included 169 samples from 110 patients with
RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 and 142 samples from 142 control patients; of which 36 samples were
from patients with seasonal coronavirus or other acute infections, and 106 samples were from a
random cohort of the Australian population obtained in 2016 and 2018 (Supplementary Dataset). A
first round of testing on all samples followed the IFU; subsequently samples within the 10% coefficient of variation (CV) range as stated in the IFU (inhibition cut-off of 18-22%, n = 21), were
repeated in duplicate to assess for inter-run variation.

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.3) or GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.2).
Binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all proportions. Differences in nonnormally distributed numerical data were calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank sum test. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed in GraphPad
Prism (version 8.4.2).

Ethics
Ethical approval for this project was obtained from the Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics
Committee (RMH HREC QA2020052).

RESULTS
Comparison of commercial ELISA vs. RT-PCR
The overall sensitivity for either IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI 59.4-75.6%)) and
specificity was 72.8% (95% CI 62.6-81.6%) (Table 1). The sensitivity for IgA or IgG detection
increased to 93.8% (95% CI 85.0-98.3%) when only samples collected >14 days post-symptom onset
were considered (Table 2), and a significant rise in signal / cut-off ratio was observed for both IgA
and IgG over time (P < 0.001) (Figure 1).

ROC AUC analysis was performed for both IgA and IgG. Overall, the IgA ROC AUC was 0.74
(95% CI 0.69-0.81) and the IgG was 0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.72) (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B).
However, when only samples collected >14 days post-symptom onset were included, the ROC AUC
increased to 0.92 (95% CI 0.87-0.96) for IgA and 0.97 (95% CI 0.94-0.99) for IgG (Supplementary
Figures 1C and 1D). No cross-reactivity with seasonal coronavirus infection was observed for IgG,
although 4/17 (23.5%) samples from patients with seasonal coronavirus (two HKU1, one NL63 and
one OC43) were positive for IgA. Neither of the two samples with anti-MERS-CoV antibodies
displayed cross-reactivity for SARS-CoV-2 IgA or IgG, but one sample with anti-SARS-CoV-1
antibodies had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG (ratios 3.81 and 1.26, respectively)
(Figure 3).

Comparison of PoCT and RT-PCR
We compared the sensitivity and specificity of five PoCT devices, using RT-PCR as our reference
standard, and interpreting PoCT results as positive when either an IgM or IgG result was read as
positive. Overall, the sensitivities ranged from 51.8% (95% CI 43.1 to 60.4%) to 68.6% (95% CI
60.1-76.3%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI 89.2-98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI 96.1-100.0%)
(Table 1 and Figures 3A and 3B). When only samples collected >14 days were considered, the
sensitivities ranged from 78.5% (95% CI 66.5-87.7%) to 93.8% (95% CI 85.0-98.3%) (Table 2).

Using Device 1 (for which there was a surplus of kits), additional testing was conducted on 1,217
samples from patients who presented with respiratory symptoms but tested RT-PCR negative for
SARS-CoV-2. In total, 39/1,217 (3.2%) samples tested positive for IgM and /or IgG. On further
testing, 6/39 samples (15.4%) tested positive to IgA and / or IgG using the ELISA assay, of which one
was confirmed by sVNT (inhibition 63.9%) when an inhibition cut-off of 20% was employed (see
below). This patient presented 21 days following symptom onset, with significant epidemiological
risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, and likely represents a true infection.

Using the highest performance device characteristics (sensitivity 68.6% [Device 4] and specificity
>99.9% [Device 5]) and lowest performance characteristics (sensitivity 51.8% [Device 2] and
specificity 95.6% [Device 1]) as hypothetical â€˜bestâ€™ and â€˜worseâ€™ scenarios respectively,

the

performance of PoCT was assessed across a range of SARS-CoV-2 population prevalence estimates
(0.1%, 1%, 5% and 10%). (Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 1). With the best performing PoCT
characteristics at an estimated SARS-CoV-2 period prevalence in Australia of 0.03%, the positive
predictive value was only 17.1%.

Comparison of sVNT and RT-PCR
In total, 311 samples were also tested using the sVNT assay. Applying a 20% inhibition cut-off and
using RT-PCR as the reference standard, the sensitivity of sVNT was 62.7% (95% CI 55.0-70.0%);
this increased to 91.2%% (95% CI 81.8-96.7%) when only samples collected >14 days post-symptom
onset were considered (Tables 1 and 2). Specificity was 94.4% (95%CI 89.2-97.5%), with crossreaction observed for eight samples (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 2). Increasing the inhibition
cut-off to 25%, or repeating samples with an initial inhibition score between 18-22% improved the
specificity to 99.3% (95% CI 96.1-99.9%) with little change in sensitivity (Tables 1 and 2). The coefficient of variation (% CV) for the in-house control sample with respect to the percentage inhibition
was 10.8% between runs, and 5.8% within-run.

DISCUSSION
Accurate laboratory testing is integral to the prevention and control of COVID-19.

The

unprecedented scale of diagnostic testing has led to the rapid development and implementation of a
large range of diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2, including serological tests. However, there are
limited peer-reviewed data on the performance characteristics of serological tests, and in order to best
inform the implementation of these assays, high-quality post-market validation data are urgently
needed to guide laboratories, public health agencies and governments in the appropriate and
responsible use of such tests (8).

In this study, we assessed the performance characteristics of five serological PoCT, one commercial
ELISA and one commercial novel surrogate virus neutralisation test against a large serum panel from
a cohort of over 100 patients with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2. In keeping with other studies
(9), the sensitivity of all assays was low (< 70%) when all sample collection time points were
considered. However, as expected given the reported antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
sensitivity increased considerably when samples collected >14 days post-symptom onset were
assessed (10), with the majority achieving sensitivities over 90%. Our findings provide further
support for recent commentary suggesting that current serological assays have limited, if any, role in
the diagnosis of acute COVID-19, with RT-PCR remaining the gold standard for diagnosis in the
acute setting (11, 12). Specificities for PoCT ranged from 92.4%-100%; it is possible this may reflect
differences in the antigens used in each assay, although specific information about the SARS-CoV-2
recombinant antigen used in the assay was not described for most PoCT. In keeping with previous
reports (13, 14), when both IgA and IgG components of the ELISA were considered, specificity was
low (72.8%), but considering IgG alone, specificity increased to 97.8%.

This study is one of the first to utilise a recently described sVNT assay (7). Previous work describing
the development of this assay reported a 95-100% sensitivity and 100% specificity using cohorts in
Singapore and China (7). In our cohort at > 14 days post symptom onset we achieved sensitivity of
91.2% (95% CI 81.8-96.7) and specificity of 94.4% (95%CI 89.2-97.5%). Although limited clinical
data are available on the cohort used to develop and validate the assay (7), it is possible that our
relatively mild clinical cohort may generate lower antibody titres than a more severely unwell cohort,
potentially influencing sensitivity of the assay (10, 15). Of note, the majority of our non-specific
(false positive) samples in the sVNT assay recorded inhibition just over the 20% cut-off. However,
specificity improved when either: (i) a higher inhibition cut-off was used, or (ii) samples within an
arbitrary range (based on the IFU reported %CV of the assay) were tested in triplicate. It is possible
that populations of different ethnic background or geographic specific cut-offs may be required for the
sVNT assay as suggested by the kit provider; in our low-prevalence setting where the test is more
likely to act as a confirmatory assay, raising the inhibition cut-off to 25% increased the specificity to
99.3% (95% CI 96.1-99.9%), thus improving clinical utility. Alternatively, introduction of an
equivocal range for the assay with repeat testing for samples within this range, would be another
approach to mitigate potential assay variation.

In contrast to acute diagnosis, there are settings where high-quality serological assays will have
utility, including (i) defining antibody prevalence in key populations such as frontline workers; (ii)
determining the extent of COVID-19 infection within the community; (iii) identifying individuals for
further evaluation of therapeutic immunoglobulin donation, and (iv) vaccine development and
evaluation. For (iii) and (iv), it is essential to have a good quantification of the functional neutralizing

antibodies among donors or vaccines. However, in order to appropriately deploy serological testing, it
is critical to understand the limitations of test performance in the epidemiological context in which
tests are used. This is particularly important in a setting such as Australia, which, based on the
number of reported cases of COVID-19 (7,060 cases as of 18th May, 2020), has an estimated
COVID-19 period prevalence of 0.03% (16). As such, even with highly sensitive and specific
serological tests, the majority of positive results are likely to represent false positives.

When

considering the use of serology to inform policies relating to relaxing of physical distancing
interventions, specificity of the assay becomes critical. If the majority of those identified as immune
are actually false positive results, then the threshold to maintain immunity within the community will
not be achieved (17).

Analogous to HIV testing in low-prevalence settings (18), serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 may
require a â€˜two-stepâ€™ approach, whereby a sensitive high-throughput â€˜screeningâ€™ assay is followed by a
high specificity assay for confirmation (e.g. neutralisation testing or Western blot). This approach
could facilitate seroepidemiological studies in low-prevalence settings, which are required to better
understand the extent of COVID-19 infection at a population-level.

Ongoing questions remain

however, about the duration and type of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, particularly around the
protective effect of neutralising antibodies against future re-infection (10). Accordingly, the concept
of an â€˜immunity passportâ€™ that facilitates return to workplaces or school should be interpreted with
caution, and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends the use of PoCT
immunodiagnostic assays in research settings only, and not for clinical decision making until further
evidence is available (19).

A key strength of this study was our systematic collection of convalescent samples. By establishing a
community collection platform, we tested over 50 patients who were more than 21 days postsymptom onset. Ideally, validation of serological assays should be performed against a testing panel
that includes samples from: (i) patients at acute and convalescent stages of infection (to assess
sensitivity), and (ii) patients with other human coronavirus infections (to assess specificity). Given
the range of serological assays now available, there is a critical need for standardised protocols,
including reference standards, across laboratories when conducting evaluations of emerging
serological assays.

In summary, our data describe the performance characteristics of five PoCT devices, a commercially
available ELISA assay and a newly developed surrogate virus neutralisation test. Overall, our findings
are in keeping with recent position statements that note that serological assays have limited, if any,
role in the diagnosis of acute COVID-19 infection. Our data strongly suggest that current PoCT
devices should not be used in the diagnosis of acute COVID-19, or as the sole assay in population-

clinical utility. The curated panel of samples assembled for this study is being expanded and provides
a valuable repository for rapid validation of new serological assays as they become available.
