Abstract

15

Following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

16

in China, airborne water droplets (aerosols) have been identified as the main transmission

17

route, although other transmission routes are likely to exist. We quantify SARS-CoV-2

18

virus survivability within water and the risk of infection posed by faecal contaminated water

19

within 39 countries. We identify that the virus can remain stable within water for up to 25

20

days, and country specific relative risk of infection posed by faecal contaminated water is

21

related to the environment. Faecal contaminated rivers, waterways and water systems

22

within countries with high infection rates can provide infectious doses >100 copies within

23

100 ml of water. The implications for freshwater systems, the coastal marine environment

24

and virus resurgence are discussed.

Introduction

28

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) began

29

in Wuhan province, China in December 2019 and has now spread throughout the world

30

with about 6 million cases confirmed globally within 214 countries and territories. Water

31

aerosols originating from individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 are considered a major

32

pathway for infection 1, and the virus has been shown to remain stable in saline solution 2

33

and under varying environmental conditions 3. Viral shedding in faeces of viable SARS-

34

CoV-2 virus is documented (eg 4) and SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been

35

detected in the shed faeces of both symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults

36

(eg 5); with potentially 43% of infections being asymptomatic and unreported 6.

37
38

Human viral pathogens that can be transmitted by water that pose moderate to high health

39

significance as defined by the WHO include adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A and E,

40

rotavirus, norovirus and other enteroviruses. The survival of the large family of

41

coronavirus in water systems has been highlighted 7, and viral loads within untreated

42

wastewater, consistent with population infection rates, have been identified 8. While

43

evidence for SARS CoV-2 is limited, other human coronaviruses are documented to

44

survive in wastewater effluent 9, with colder water temperature likely to increase survival

45

considerably 3. Collectively this evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive

46

within water and the viral loads within untreated sewage effluent are likely high in countries

47

of high infection rates, a portion of which is viable virus, and therefore water contaminated

48

with sewage provides a potential faecal-oral transmission route (eg 10).

49
50

Sewage can directly enter natural water systems due to combined sewer overflow events

51

and sewage exfiltration from pipes (eg 11) unexpected failure of water treatment systems or

52

a complete lack of water treatment infrastructure, providing a pathway for onward

53

transmission. For example, during the current pandemic large sewage spills, flooding

54

dwellings and community spaces, have occurred in America (within Georgia, Florida and

55

New York) and Spain (Andalucia), while temporary settlements (eg shanty towns, favelas

56

or bustees) and refugee camps are less likely to have safe sanitation systems. Within

57

these settings, this water system pathway could enable viral infection to humans or other

58

susceptible animals via water ingestion or through filtering of water during feeding.

59
60

The highly skewed distribution of infected patient viral loads observed 12 contain the effects

61

of super spreaders, where single individuals can be responsible for the majority of the viral

62

loading. This viral distribution means that sewage originating from populations that contain

63

super spreaders will contain very high viral loads, even though the majority of the

64

population contribute relatively low viral loadings.

65
66

Considering the above, we identify the survivability of SARS-CoV-2 within water systems

67

using published in vitro study data 3. We then used an established ‘down the drain’

68

pollution analysis to calculate the dilution in rivers 13, combined with our empirical virus

69

survivability model, to calculate of the relative risk posed to humans by sewage spills

70

within 39 countries. Results using infection numbers on May 03 2020 for 21 countries,

71

where inland water temperatures were available, identify viable waterborne virus

72

concentrations that, if faecal contamination had occurred, would result in a high probability

73

of infection. The implications of these findings for waterborne virus transmission to humans

74

and animals are discussed and recommendations for reducing risk of infection are given.

75
76

Results

77

Exponential temperature driven survivability identifies that the virus can remain stable and

78

79

country comparable risk associated with a sewage spill after dilution within rivers (figure

80

1b, 1c) is dependent upon domestic water usage and riverine dilution, where dilution is

81

dependent upon geographical location, relief and weather. Countries with lowest relative

82

risk are those with both high domestic water usage and high dilution (eg Canada, Norway

83

and Venezuela). Highest relative risk results from a combination of low to medium

84

domestic water usage and low dilution (eg Morocco, Spain, Germany). Translating these

85

results to the proportion of the population infected within 21 countries on May 03 2020

86

identifies the estimated upper and lower limit of viable waterborne virus concentration

87

within the first 24 hours, assuming that a spill occurred (figure 2; uncertainty on the viable

88

virus concentration is ±68% copies L-1). Absolute concentrations are higher and will exist

89

for longer within countries with a combination of higher relative risk, colder water and high

90

population infection rates. Assuming infection requires a dose of 100 copies, then a person

91

within the 3 countries with the highest concentrations (Spain, UK, Morocco) who within 24

92

hours of a spill ingests 100 ml of the contaminated water could receive a total dose >468

93

copies resulting in a high probability of infection (table 1; full dosage range across all

94

cases is 46 to 3080 copies). 100 ml is the equivalent of 1 to 2 mouthfuls and swimmers

95

can swallow up to 280 ml in a 45 minute swim 14. The combination of figure 1a and figure

96

2a can be used to understand the viable virus concentration after the first 24 hours. The

97

water temperature-controlled virus survivability means that concentrations reduce quickly

98

in Morocco within 24 hours of a spill, whereas the concentrations remain for longer in

99

Spain and the UK where water temperatures are lower (table 1; Figure 2a).

Discussion

115

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aquatic environment 15 does not necessarily

116

translate into the presence of viable virus. To estimate the number of viable (infectious)

117

virus copies, the proportion of infectious viruses in sewage must be known. The presence

118

of infectious virus in stool samples has been demonstrated 4, but there is a lack of

119

quantitative data on this ratio for SARS-CoV-2 in stool. We instead used literature on the

120

number of infectious adenovirus copies in sewage (eg 16) and wastewater discharge into

121

rivers 17 to select high (10-1) medium (10-2) and low (10-3) estimates for the ratio of

122

infectious virus to genome copies to infectious viruses. We note that adenoviruses are

123

known to be particularly resilient, and therefore likely to represent an upper estimate, but

124

also that our selected range is consistent with the 10-3 value used elsewhere for assessing

125

viral risk in water systems (eg 14), including one assessment for SARS CoV-2 transmission

126

risk to wastewater workers 18.

127
128

The temperature dependent survivability means that it is likely that the risk posed by

129

wastewater will increase during winter months as the sewage temperature will be lower

130

enabling longer viral survival, but temperature history and age of the sewage will be

131

needed to fully understand any detected viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 infection to, and spread

132

between, domestic cats has occurred due to similarities between human and some animal

133

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene 20. Increased animal foraging can occur

134

downstream from water treatment facilities, relative to upstream, highlighting possible risk

135

of some riparian wildlife infection if feeding occurs after a spill.

136
137

Implications for drinking water

138

It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 survivability and transport within rivers could impact

139

drinking water supplies in countries where rivers or reservoirs are the primary drinking

140

water sources and where large populations, with little or no sewage treatment, exist close

141

to the water source, such as within refugee camps or shanty towns. Riverine enteric virus

142

transport and catchment accumulation can occur for common viruses (eg 21) and under

143

stratified conditions it would be possible for a river plume to enter a reservoir and

144

subsequently exit through the reservoir outlet without mixing with the main body of water.

145

Filtering of water, followed by ultraviolet disinfection or chlorination are the recommended

146

approaches for virus removal from drinking water sources 22. Filtering is normally used to

147

remove large particulates. The effective ultraviolet dose for SARS-CoV-2 disinfection

148

appears highly variable and dependent upon the surface to which the virus is attached 23.

149

The upper dosage value of 1 Joule (J) cm-2 to ensure effective ultraviolet disinfection of

150

SARS-CoV-2 23 is an order of magnitude larger than that typically used (~40 to 90 mJ cm-

151

2

152

(WHO) guidelines state that effective chlorination disinfection occurs at residual chlorine

153

concentrations of ≥0.5 mg L-1 22 , which matches the minimum needed to deactivate

154

SARS-CoV-1 24. However, the actual chlorine dosage used for water treatment can vary,

155

based on country, region, water origin and infrastructure (eg UK guidelines are

156

concentrations of 0.2 to 0.5 mg L-1). Collectively this means that if a drinking water source

157

was to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 the standard virus removal and disinfection

158

approaches of ultraviolet exposure and chlorination may not reduce the virus below

159

detectable limits. Reviewing of regional or countrywide drinking water processing

160

approaches is recommended to reduce the potential for SARS-CoV-2 surviving through

161

drinking water processing systems. Boiling of drinking water will result in the virus being

162

deactivated 22. Refrigerated food that becomes contaminated (eg through washing or

163

handling) could remain infectious for up to 25 days.

166

Implications for the marine environment

167

The virus remains stable over a range of pH 3 and in sterile saline solution at low

168

temperatures 2, so it is possible that there is no significant difference in virus temporal

169

survival and infection risk between freshwater and seawater, and SARS-CoV-2 has

170

already been identified within seawater, originating from untreated wastewater 7.

171

Bioaccumulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by molluscs and other aquatic organisms may

172

occur as bivalves are known to accumulate waterborne viruses including hepatitis,

173

norovirus and avian influenza 25.

174
175

Multiple cetaceans have very high ACE2 similarity to humans making them susceptible to

176

SARS-CoV-2 infection including harbor porpoises, bottle nosed dolphins, minke whales,

177

orca and pilot whales 20. Of particular concern are whales whose throats are exposed to

178

large volumes of water during feeding and who visit coastlines for prey that are known to

179

accumulate around sewage outfalls, such as minke whales feeding on mackerel or orca

180

feeding on chinook salmon. In these instances, the animal could be exposed to a large

181

viral dose, even if the virus is only present within the water in low concentrations. For

182

example, if the riverine viral concentration is low at 1 copie ml-1, which is undetectable by

183

PCR (detection limit is >100 copies ml-1), then a medium sized whale filtering water during

184

feeding could receive repeated doses of 5.65 million copies every second (see methods

185

for calculation). A seafood market is among the suspected sources for the origin of the

186

SARS-CoV-2 virus, so any viral transmission from land to sea may be a circular process.

187
188

Conclusions

189

Natural water systems are likely able to act as a transmission pathway for SARS-CoV-2

190

which poses a threat to human infection. The analysis suggests that public interactions

191

with rivers and coastal waters following wastewater spills should be minimized to reduce

192

the risk of infection. New volume integrating viral detection methods are needed to ensure

193

the safety of water systems. While the primary risk associated with the current COVID-19

194

outbreak appears to be human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, this work supports

195

the plausibility that novel coronaviruses may also spill over to new wildlife hosts through

196

infected faecal matter accidentally entering the natural aquatic environment; this potential

197

virus reservoir could enable future resurgence in the human population.

Methods

216

Risk from wastewater spillage between countries

217

The relative risk of SARS CoV-2 from waste water systems is calculated by using a

218

modified version of equations 1 and 2 from 13, given as

219

𝐻! = !

220

where Vww,c is the per capital daily volume of domestic water usage for country c, and DFc

221

is the dilution factor downloaded from 13 supplemental table 1 and supplemental table 2,

222

respectively. Normalising Hc across all country median DF values provides the between

223

country relative risk of water borne infection due to the viral load in a river following a

224

sewage effluent spill (shown in figures 1b and 1c).

!!,! !"!

225
226

The number of infectious virus copies in the water system as a result of a waste water spill

227

or leak is calculated by multiplying Hc by the number of infectious viruses in faeces

228

generated by the infectious proportion of a county’s population, Cinf,c. This is calculated

229

using

230

𝐶!"#,! =

231

where Vfaeces is the volume of faeces generated (litres, L, per capita per day), Cfaeces is the

232

number of viral RNA copies in faecal matter (L-1), Pc is the proportion of the population of

233

country c that have active infections, and I is the ratio of viral RNA copies to viable

234

(infectious) virus.

235

We note that measured wastewater viral counts in Paris on the 9th April were 3.1 × 106

236

genome copies L-1 with 82,000 active cases 19, whereas using our (albeit country specific)

237

method gives the estimate of 1.3 × 106 genome copies L-1, which is within the correct order

238

of magnitude (this calculation used the same number of active cases).

we use to estimate Cfaeces was measured from samples collected in Germany. The

256

Rodríguez et al., 2013) wastewater discharged into rivers 17. These estimates varied over

simplified country outline. The dilution factors reported in 13 can vary by several orders of

270

magnitude and were deemed to provide the major source of uncertainty in the calculation.

271

Therefore, the Cspill,c viral loadings given by the 25th percentile dilution, median dilution and

272

75th percentile dilution values are all presented. With high, medium and low estimates for I,

273

this results in nine estimates of Cspill for each country.

275

The long-term statistical mean global lake water temperature climatology was constructed

276

using the 0.05° × 0.05° daily resolution GloboLakes v4 data set 29 which covers 1996 to

277

2016. Mean temperature was calculated for each calendar month across all years

278

producing 12 monthly mean datasets with a 0.05° × 0.05° gridded resolution. Uncertainty

279

terms were propagated by assuming random errors were independent and normally

280

distributed, and using standard error propagation methods. The resulting uncertainty term

281

combines the original uncertainty in measurement and optimum interpolation with the

282

spatial/temporal uncertainty of the resampled monthly average, for each grid cell.

283
284

The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus needed for infection is not known. 30 provides 103

285

copies for influenza. The Infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 is likely significantly lower

286

because 31 ranks influenza as "very high infective dose" and SARS-CoV-2 as "low". We

287

therefore use a value of 100 copies as a concentration that could result in infection.

288
289

A combined uncertainty budget for equation 4 was calculated using standard uncertainty

290

propagating methods and estimates of the uncertainties of each input dataset. Uncertainty

291

components (and their values) were domestic water usage (±10%), population size (±1%),

number of active cases (±20%), mass of faeces generated per capita per day (0.095 kg,

293

see table 3 of 26, mean number of viral genome copies in faeces (3.54×1012) and density of

294

faeces was not included in the uncertainty analysis. This resulted in a combined

295

uncertainty budget of ±68% copies ml-1. It is important to note that this value does not

296

include uncertainty in the dilution factors or the ratio of viral genome copies to infectious

297

virus. Instead, the Cinf calculation was repeated for high, medium and low values of these

298

parameters.

Temperature dependent survival

301

As reported in 3, the virus concentration in water follows an exponential decay, with its

302

half-life decreasing with decreasing temperature and the pH control of half life is very small

303

over the pH range of 3-10 (which encompasses the range found in natural freshwater and

304

marine systems). Based on the in vitro data presented in 3, the following empirical model

305

was derived to describe virus concentration reduction factor due to the temperature-

306

dependent die-off:

307

𝑟 = 10!.05! °! !!.32

(5)

308

𝑛 𝑡 = 𝐶! 10!!"

(6)

309

Where C0 is initial virus concentration (copies ml-1), n(t) is virus concentration after time t

310

(days) and r is 24 hour survival factor due to temperature T driven die off. This model fit to

311

the in vitro data gives a root mean square difference (RMSD) of ±1% for water at 4°C

312

which increases to ±7.5% at 22°C. When considering temperature controlled survival in

313

the waste water system, Cww,c becomes the value used for the initial viral load C0 following

314

a sewage effluent spill. As noted in 5,12, the viral load follows a heavy-tailed distribution

315

with the majority of patients shedding around 105 copies ml-1) but some having viral loads

316

as high as 1012 copies ml-1. This results in the super-spreader problem where a tiny

317

proportion of the infected population can become responsible for contributing a majority of

318

viral load in the wastewater. For a large infected population, this approach allows robust

319

statistical modeling of viral load. However, in case of smaller communities with low number

320

of infections, the actual viral load could be severely underestimated if a super-spreader is

321

present within the population.

Whale filtering calculation

324

The example volume flow rate through the mouth of a medium sized Bowhead whale

325

whilst feeding was provided by 32) A flow rate of 5.65 m3 s–1 is given for a 15 m whale

326

(mouth pressure of –1768 Pa at a 4 km h–1 foraging speed, assuming an oral opening of

327

5.09 m2 with an opening radius = 1.27 m). Assuming a low viral concentration of 1 copies

328

per ml-1, which equates to 1000 copies l-1. 5.65 m3 s–1 equates to 5650 L s-1. The dosage

329

per second as the whale swims during feeding is given by 1000 (copies L-1) × 5650 (L s-1)

330

= 5.65 million copies s-1.
