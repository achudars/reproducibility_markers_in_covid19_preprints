Abstract
Background
The effect of contact reduction measures on infectious disease transmission can only be
assessed indirectly and with considerable delay. However, individual social contact data and
population mobility data can offer near real-time proxy information.
Aim
To compare social contact data and population mobility data with respect to their ability to
predict transmission dynamics during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Germany.
Methods
We quantified the change in social contact patterns derived from self-reported contact survey
data collected by the German COVIMOD study from 04/2020-06/2020 (compared to the prepandemic period), and estimated the percentage mean reduction in the effective reproduction
number R(t) over time. We compared these results to the ones based on R(t) estimates from
open-source mobility data and to R(t) values provided by the German Public Health Institute.
Results
We observed the largest reduction in social contacts (90%, compared to pre-pandemic data)
in late April corresponding to the strictest contacts reduction measures. Thereafter, the
reduction in contacts dropped continuously to a minimum of 73% in late June. R(t) estimates
based on social contacts underestimated measured R(t) values slightly in the time of strictest
contact reduction measures but predicted R(t) well thereafter. R(t) estimates based on mobility
data overestimated R(t) considerably throughout the study.
Conclusions
R(t) prediction accuracy based on contact survey data was superior to the one based on
population mobility data, indicating that measuring changes in mobility alone is not sufficient
for understanding changes in transmission dynamics triggered by public health measures.

Introduction
The role of social contacts for the spread of respiratory infections has been discussed
extensively in the year 2020 due to the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1,2]. As of March 2021, over 100 million confirmed cases
and over 2.5 million deaths have been recorded worldwide [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is primarily
transmitted via droplets and aerosols, so that person-to-person contacts are a strong
determinant of transmission dynamics [2–4]. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)
focusing on the reduction of person-to-person contacts are one of the cornerstones of the
pandemic response. In the middle of March 2020, Germany mandated school and kindergarten
closures, postponed academic semesters, prohibited visiting of nursing homes and restricted
the number of people allowed at public and private gatherings in an attempt to protect the
vulnerable groups [5]. In the following weeks, contact reduction measures were implemented
on a population level by regulating the maximum number of close social contacts outside one’s
household and by closing non-essential shops as well as places for leisure activities [5]. After
a considerable reduction in reported case numbers, federal governments decided to ease
these restrictions gradually starting at the beginning of May 2020.
Social contact patterns are known to be a critical factor for the transmission dynamics of
respiratory infections [4,6–10]. However, empirical social contact data have been scarce
before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 [11–13]. One exception is the POLYMOD study, a
large-scale survey that described social mixing patterns in eight European countries [12]. In
2005/2006, POLYMOD measured contacts of more than 7,000 participants across eight
European countries [12]. Contact patterns observed in POLYMOD have been widely used to
parametrize various mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics [3,4,12,14].
During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, contact surveys were initiated in several countries to
understand the effect of contact precaution measures on social contact patterns [3,4,10,15,16].
While contact surveys offer a direct approach to social contact patterns, they are time- and
cost-intensive, and need to be initiated actively. Mobile phone-based mobility data offer a
complementary approach to infer changes in contact patterns in a population. Google and
Apple granted free access to anonymized mobility data in a global attempt to provide insights
into the change of mobility during the pandemic given different physical distancing policies
[17,18]. Several SARS-CoV-2 modelling studies assumed that aggregated mobility data can
be used as a proxy for the actual number and intensity of contacts of individuals in a defined
population, although mobility data measure only certain dimensions of contact behaviour. In
this article, we present survey-based social contact data for the first wave of the pandemic in
Germany, and assess their ability to predict transmission dynamics (measured by effective

reproduction number (R(t)) estimates) when compared to open source population mobility data
from Google and Apple [17–19].

Methods
Contact surveys
Pandemic contact survey – COVIMOD
The contact survey COVIMOD was initiated in April 2020. We commissioned the market
research company IPSOS-Mori to conduct the survey based on participants of the online-panel
i-say.com. To ensure the samples’ broad representativeness of the German population,
participants were recruited by sending email invitations to existing members of the panel based
on age, sex, and regional quotas. To gain information on children’s social contacts, a defined
subgroup of adult participants with under-aged children (<18 years of age) living in their
household were invited to provide information as a proxy for their children. This approach,
however, resulted in the sample being no longer representative of the German population as
we under-sampled the middle-aged participants who instead filled out the questionnaire for
their children. The first COVIMOD survey wave was launched on the 30/04/2020
corresponding to the time of the strictest contact reduction measures in Germany. Survey
waves two to four were launched during a time of a gradual easing of the contact reduction
measures in May and June 2020. For wave one, a sample of 1.500 participants was
commissioned with IPSOS-Mori with an expected response rate of 85% for the next survey
waves. Before the launch of survey wave four, the sample was increased by 1,000 additional
participants.
The COVIMOD questionnaire includes questions on demographics, current behaviours,
attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2, as well as the social contacts of participants. Participants were
asked to provide each social contact between 5am the preceding day and 5am the day of the
survey, the age and sex of the contact, the duration they spend with each contact, the setting
where the contact occurred and if the contact was a household member or not. The
questionnaire can be found in Supplementary File 2.
We defined a contact in COVIMOD in line with the POLYMOD study’s definition as “people
who you met in person and with whom you exchanged at least a few words, or with whom you
had physical contact” [12]. During survey wave one and two, participants were asked to provide
each contact separately. Instead of providing each contact one by one, some participants
included a group of contacts as one contact (e.g. “customers”). For these groups, we assumed
a specific number of social contacts (Supplementary File 3). From survey wave three onwards,

participants were offered the opportunity to provide a number of additional contacts (group
contacts) they were not able to list individually in case they had too many contacts.
As participants were offered to enter these additional contacts separately, we used different
analyses approaches to work with these contacts (scenarios). The main scenario includes all
reported contacts plus group contacts weighted for the German population for COVIMOD and
POLYMOD. Unweighted results and those without group contacts can be found in the
supplementary.

Pre-pandemic contact survey – POLYMOD
The European contact survey POLYMOD was used as a baseline pre-pandemic comparison.
In Germany, POLYMOD was conducted paper-based with the help of a market research
company in 2005/06. Further details about POLYMOD can be found elsewhere [12]. As in
COVIMOD, participants in POLYMOD were also allowed to enter the number of additional
contacts (group contacts) they had if participants had too many contacts to report them
separately.

Mobility data
We obtained publicly available aggregated mobility data from the Google COVID-19
Community Mobility Reports and from the COVID-19 Apple Mobility trends for the times
corresponding to the COVIMOD survey waves [17,18].
Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports provide the percentage change in mobility from
February 2020 onwards compared to the median of the corresponding weekday between
03/01/2020 and 06/02/2020. Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports use aggregated
information about true individual movement histories to provide location-specific changes in
mobility over time. Data are stratified by the destination of the movement, i.e. retail and
recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace, residential and parks. COVID19 Apple Mobility trends provide information about the relative volume of requests for directions
for all weeks in 2020 compared to a base volume on 13/01/2020.

Effective reproduction number
R(t) values used in our analysis were obtained from the German Public Health Institute (Robert
Koch Institute (RKI)) [19,20]. The 4-day reproduction number calculated by the RKI provides
information of the transmission dynamics 8 to 13 days prior [20]. We used the reproduction
number provided by the RKI 10 days after the timing of our survey waves.

Statistical analyses
As the COVIMOD sample is not fully representative of the German population, we used data
from the 2011 census to apply survey weights based on the participants’ age, sex, household
size and region of residence [21]. The region of residence was not available for POLYMOD,
so the POLYMOD data were only weighted according to the participants’ age, sex, and
household size using the R package ‘survey’ [22].
We calculated the mean number of social contacts per participant per day, and stratified the
social contacts by age group, sex, household size and the day of the week. Additionally, we
assessed setting-specific contacts, i.e. home, childcare/school/university, work, public
transport, others; childcare/school/university contacts were assessed in the subgroup of
participants who reported to attend childcare, school or university, and work contacts were
assessed in the subgroup of participants who worked full- or part-time. We calculated
symmetric social contact matrices for the age-specific daily frequency of direct social contacts
using the ‘socialmixr’ package in R [23]. For the calculation of the contact matrices, participants
who reported more than 100 group contacts were excluded from the analysis (COVIMOD:
wave three - 6 participants, wave four - 13 participants, POLYMOD: 10 participants).
We assumed that the next-generation matrix for SARS-CoV-2 is a function of the number of
age-specific contacts, the duration of infectiousness and the probability that a contact leads to
transmission [24]. Hence the basic reproduction number (R0) is proportional to the dominant
eigenvalue of the contact matrix [25]. To be able to calculate R(t) as the result of a relative
reduction in R0, we assumed that the social contact patterns before the implementation of the
contact reduction measures were similar to the POLYMOD contact patterns and that the
duration of infectiousness and the per-contact transmission probability remained constant.
Additionally, we assumed that the transmission probability did not depend on age. Under these
assumptions, the relative reduction of R(t) from R0 is equivalent to the reduction in the contact
matrices’ dominant eigenvalue allowing us to estimate the reproduction number corresponding
to contacts recorded in COVIMOD. We assumed R0 to follow a normal distribution with mean
2.6 and standard deviation 0.54 [3]. We drew 10,000 bootstrap samples from POLYMOD and
COVIMOD to assess uncertainty.
To assess mobility, we averaged across all the movement types for the Google mobility data
and for the Apple mobility data except for the movements to parks as this is expected to vary
tremendously during the seasons. We only assessed mobility data for the same time intervals
as the COVIMOD waves’ timings. We calculated the mean percentage change within the time
interval as well as the minimum and maximum for each time interval of the COVIMOD waves
for Google and Apple mobility.

Similarly, we calculated the mean and the minimum and maximum of the RKI R(t) estimates
for the corresponding time intervals.
R version 4.0.2 was used for all analyses [26].

Ethics approval
COVIMOD was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical Board Westfalen-Lippe and
the University of Münster (2020-473-f-s). Informed consent was obtained from all COVIMOD
participants. As only anonymised POLYMOD data were used in this study, institutional review
was not required for reanalysis [12].

Results
Participant characteristics of POLYMOD and COVIMOD
During POLYMOD, 1,341 participants were surveyed in Germany; they recorded a total of
22,814 contacts. In the first COVIMOD wave, we surveyed 1,560 participants who recorded a
total of 3,256 social contacts; this changed to 1,356 participants with a total of 4,852 contacts
in the second survey wave, 1,081 participants with a total of 6,311 in the third wave, and 1,890
participants with a total of 13,346 contacts in the fourth wave.
The youngest participants in all COVIMOD waves were younger than one (the parents were
surveyed as a proxy), and the oldest was 91 years of age. Between 47% and 50% of all
COVIMOD participants were female (Table 1). In POLYMOD and all COVIMOD waves, the
median household size of the participants was 3 (POLYMOD IQR 2-4, COVIMOD wave one
IQR 2-4, wave two IQR 2-3, wave three IQR 2-3, wave four IQR 1-3). In COVIMOD survey
waves one, two and three, most participants reported their social contacts on a Thursday,
whereas in wave four, most contacts were reported on a Monday; less than a quarter of
participants reported the contacts during the weekend (Table 1).

Missing in COVIMOD included participants who preferred not to answer the question

A comparison of the characteristics of German population and the POLYMOD and COVIMOD
participants can be found in Supplementary File 1, Table 1. The participant characteristics after
weighting can be found in Supplementary File 1, Table 1.1a. The analyses hereafter are based
on the weighted data including group contacts.

Number of social contacts

The mean number of contacts measured per participant during all COVIMOD waves (wave
one, 1.9 contacts (SD 1.8), wave two, 3.5 contacts (SD 6.1), wave three, 6.5 contacts (SD
21.6), wave four, 7.3 contacts (SD 29.6)) was considerably lower in comparison to the 19.6
contacts (SD 27.7) measured in POLYMOD pre-pandemically (Figure 1a; Supplementary File
1 Table 1.2a). The reduction in the number of overall contacts between POLYMOD and
COVIMOD was consistent across age, sex, household size and weekday (Figure 1;
Supplementary File 1 Table 1.2a). The patterns and relative reductions observed for physical
contacts (skin-to-skin) measured during COVIMOD was generally in line with those observed
for all contacts (Supplementary File 1 Table 1.2b, Figure 1.5b).
While the mean number of home contacts was stable across all COVIMOD waves (and just a
little bit lower than in POLYMOD, Figure 1, Supplementary File 1 Table 1.2a), contacts at work
and in educational settings were dramatically reduced during the first COVIMOD wave.
Contacts at work increased gradually thereafter but remained much lower than in POLYMOD
even for survey wave four; educational contacts started to increase only at survey wave four
as schools were closed before (Figure 1, Supplementary File 1 Table 1.2c). Moreover, the
distribution of contacts observed changed considerably over the different COVIMOD waves.
While the maximum number of contacts reported overall and in specific settings was clearly
reduced in the first COVIMOD wave, it approximated the one reported in POLYMOD already
in wave two and three and reached it in wave four (although mean and median contact
numbers were still clearly reduced). The number of contacts in different settings for the
unweighted analyses can be found in Supplementary File 1 Tables 2.2c, 3.2c and 4.2c.
Participants in the age group 0 to 19 years reported the highest mean number of skin-to-skin
contacts compared to the other age groups for POLYMOD and all COVIMOD waves
(Supplementary File 1 Figure 1.5b). A similar trend was also observed in participants with a
household size of more than four (Supplementary File 1 Figure 1.5c).
POLYMOD and COVIMOD participants in all age groups shared the majority of their contacts
with individuals of similar age, demonstrating the expected age-assortative pattern (Figure 2;
Supplementary File 1 Figures 1.6a). Since contact matrices derived from the first two
COVIMOD waves were dominated by contacts at home, they reveal mainly contacts with life
partners and children. This changed slowly through survey waves three and four due to the
gradual increase in work and leisure time (“other”) contacts, which resulted in a broader
distribution of the age of potential contact persons.

Prediction of effective reproduction numbers based on contact and mobility data
In all COVIMOD waves, the mean R(t) estimated based on COVIMOD data was smaller than
1 (representing a percentage mean reduction in contacts of at least 70%); we observed the
highest percentage mean reduction with 90% at the end of April (survey wave one), which
corresponds to the time of the strictest contact reduction measures. Subsequently, the mean
reduction decreased with time as the contact reduction measures were loosened (wave two:
86%, wave three: 80%, wave four: 73%; Figure 3; Supplementary File 1 Table 1.3). Compared
to the R(t) values reported by the RKI, R(t) estimates based on COVIMOD were lower during
the first survey wave, but fit quite well during wave two to four. R(t) estimates based on Google
and Apple data were considerably higher than RKI R(t) estimates throughout the entire study
(Figure 3; Supplementary File 1 Table 1.3). Both mobility data sources found mobility patterns
similar to pre-pandemic data already during the time of survey wave one and two, while true
R(t) values were still considerably below 1.

Discussion
We showed in this study that non-pharmaceutical interventions introduced in Germany during
the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were associated with a considerable reduction in
social contacts reported in contact surveys. We quantified the relative reduction in contacts
based on contact survey data and publicly available mobility data and found that changes in
contact patterns measured in survey data predicted transmission dynamics (measured as R(t))
better than changes measured in aggregated mobility data. This indicates that deriving contact
behaviour from mobility data alone is not suitable for making real-time inference on the effects
of public health measures on the transmission dynamics in a population. Mobility data used in
this study suggested that contact behaviour went back to normal almost instantly after the

contact reduction measures were relaxed, which did not reflect the observed R(t) values. A
reason for that might be that people still tried to minimise close contacts outside their own
households, and maximised distance to the contacts they had, although their mobility, e.g.
back to work, already reached almost pre-pandemic levels.
Consistent with studies from other European countries, we found a 73% mean reduction in
contacts across the first four waves of COVIMOD [3,4]. Even though the reported number of
daily contacts increased over the survey waves, it was still considerably lower than in
POLYMOD, indicating sustainable behaviour change even after the end of the strictest contact
reduction measures. We found an increased variance in the reported daily number of contacts
as the COVIMOD waves progressed, with the maximum number of contacts increasing from
16 in survey wave one to 674 in wave four, while median contact numbers were not affected
similarly. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be associated with a high variance in the
number of transmissions arising from one infectious individual [27], this sharp increase in the
maximum number of contacts has huge implications for the risk of superspreading events as
the direct aftermath of the end of public health interventions. Participants aged 60 and above
reported fewer contacts in all COVIMOD waves as well as a larger reduction to pre-pandemic
values when compared to children and middle-aged persons. This should be taken into
account when assessing the effects of vaccination prioritization strategies in combination with
NPIs, as people in this age group are known to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infections
[15].
We further observed a smaller and more stable reduction in home contacts than in work,
educational and leisure time contacts, which confirms the assertion that reduction in contacts
is location-specific [3]. This is reasonable as most of the social distancing measures
implemented had their main impact outside the household. We confirmed that the majority of
remaining contacts under strict contact reduction measures happens between life partners and
parents and children, which mirrors the huge role of this transmission setting under contact
reduction measures [7,28].
Our study has several limitations. COVIMOD data are not fully representative of the German
population since some adult participants with under-aged children living in their household
were invited to provide information as a proxy for their children. Moreover, the elderly (>70
years) and the very young (<10 years of age) are underrepresented in COVIMOD. We tried to
correct for that by introducing weights for sex, age, and household size; however, there were
no relevant differences in the results of the unweighted and weighted analyses. Participants in
COVIMOD were asked to record their contacts retrospectively so that different forms of
information bias could have been introduced. For example, it might be challenging to
remember a higher number of contacts, or the participants' willingness to report high numbers
of contacts individually might be lower as this is quite tedious and time-consuming. We tried to

minimise this by allowing the participants to record group contacts. We also cannot rule out
that COVIMOD attracted specifically participants who adhered to social distancing rules as
these individuals might be more likely to respond to health surveys. This could have led to an
overestimation of the relative reduction of contacts, and could explain the gap between R(t)
values based on case numbers and R(t) values estimated from contact data. We tried to
minimise this bias by using an established online panel not focusing on healthcare questions
as the platform for COVIMOD. Even though contact-related questions were similarly phrased
between POLYMOD and COVIMOD, POLYMOD was paper-based, and COVIMOD surveys
were web-based. Previous research suggested that participants might report more contacts in
paper-based surveys than in web-based surveys [11,29]. Future research will be conducted
on the differences between web- and paper-based contacts during the pandemic. However,
our findings are consistent with other studies that examined social contact patterns under strict
contact reduction measures [3,4,15,30]. We used aggregated mobility data in our study that
were freely available and have been discussed as a potential real-time proxy for SARS-CoV2 transmission dynamics. Although we took advantage of two different data sources
representing complementary ways to define mobility, our results cannot be automatically
generalized to other ways of measuring mobility (e.g. based on individual movement patterns).
In summary, our study provides a comprehensive quantification of social contacts and mixing
patterns relevant to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during spring and summer 2020 in Germany.
Our results indicate that population-based contact surveys provide a suitable platform for near
real-time assessment of transmission dynamics for respiratory infections in a population.
However, this requires considerable financial and computational efforts. Aggregated mobility
data as a proxy for contacts did not show the same degree of persistent reduction, and
consequently did not reflect the development of effective reproduction numbers.
