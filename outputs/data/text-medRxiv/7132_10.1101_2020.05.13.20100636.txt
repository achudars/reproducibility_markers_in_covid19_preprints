Abstract

Identification of immunogenic targets of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for monitoring of antiviral
immunity and vaccine design. Currently, mainly anti-spike (S)-protein adaptive immunity is
investigated. However, also the nucleocapsid (N)- and membrane (M)-proteins should be
considered as diagnostic and prophylactic targets.
The aim of our study was to explore and compare the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-, Mand N-proteins in context of different COVID-19 manifestations. Analyzing a cohort of COVID19 patients with moderate, severe, and critical disease severity, we show that overlapping
peptide pools (OPP) of all three proteins can activate SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells with
a stronger response of CD4+ compared to CD8+ T-cells. Although interindividual variations for
the three proteins were observed, M-protein induced the highest frequencies of CD4+ T-cells,
suggesting its relevance as diagnostic and vaccination target. Importantly, patients with
critical COVID-19 demonstrated the strongest T-cell response, including the highest
frequencies of cytokine-producing bi- and trifunctional T-cells, for all three proteins. Although
the higher magnitude and superior functionality of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in critical
patients can also be a result of a stronger immunogenicity provided by severe infection, it
disproves the hypothesis of insufficient SARS-CoV-2-reactive immunity in critical COVID-19. To
this end, activation of effector T-cells with differentiated memory phenotype found in our
study could cause hyper-reactive response in critical cases leading to immunopathogenesis.
Conclusively, since the S-, M-, and N-proteins induce T-cell responses with individual
differences, all three proteins should be evaluated for diagnostics and therapeutic strategies
to avoid underestimation of cellular immunity and to deepen our understanding of COVID-19
immunity.

Main text
Clearance of viral pathogens requires an effective T cell response directed against protein
antigens expressed by the virus1. The T cell response against the severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 virus, which causes the ongoing pandemic, is
presumably initiated by respiratory professional antigen presenting cells (APC) that can engulf
viral antigens as shown for the 2002/03 SARS-CoV2. The activated T cells can migrate to the
site of infection, where they facilitate viral clearance, but can also contribute to immune
pathogenesis. There is mounting evidence that the latter is the major reason for critical
COVID-19 disease manifestations3,4.
The SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins: the spike glycoprotein (S), the envelope (E)
protein, the membrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein5. The S-protein mediates
host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)6. Due to its surfaceexposure and crucial role for infecting the host cell, the S-protein is an attractive therapeutic
target, for instance for antibodies that block the S/ACE2 interaction. In fact, it was shown that
patients recovered from COVID-19 developed virus neutralizing anti-S immunoglobulin (Ig)
titers7. Given the requirement for T cell help in generation of high affinity IgG antibodies, this
finding indicates that S-protein reactive T cell immunity was formed in those patients8,9.
Accordingly, very recent studies identified SARS-CoV-2 S-protein reactive T cell responses in
patients suffering from moderate, severe, and critical COVID-194,10. Furthermore, it was
shown that the amount of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells increased with disease progression11.
Besides the S-protein, also the N- and M-proteins were suggested as potential targets for
diagnostic and prophylactic approaches3,5. In fact, B cell responses against the N-protein
seemed to be the first to arise 4–8 days after symptom onset for the 2002/03 SARS-CoV
infection12,13, which indicates that also N-reactive T cell response are prevalent during this
timeframe. However, data on T cell responses towards the N- and M-proteins for the
pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection are currently not available. For this reason, we sought to
identify, characterize, and compare S-, M-, and N-reactive T cell responses in COVID-19
patients with different clinical manifestation.
We analyzed 57 blood samples drawn at different time points after hospital admission of a
cohort of 28 COVID-19 patients with moderate (28 samples), severe (16 samples), and critical
(13 samples) disease manifestation (Table S1). The samples were grouped according to the
COVID-19 severity at the sampling time into moderate, severe, critical manifestation using the

German Robert-Koch-Institute symptom classification as previously described4. In agreement
with other studies14, we observed significantly more males within critical COVID-19 patients
compared to the moderate and severe cases. However, bivariate regression analysis revealed
no significant influence of gender on the main findings when comparing different COVID-19
severity (Table S2). There were no significant differences in sampling time with respect to the
PCR-testing or hospitalization between the groups (Table S3).
By stimulation with S-, M-, or N- overlapping peptide pools (OPP) (Fig. S1), we could show that
all three proteins have the capacity to induce SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig.
1a). Overall, we detected a CD4+ T cell response in 54 out of 57 and a CD8+ T cell response in
44 out of 57 of the patient samples against at least one of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. However,
none of the proteins was able to induce CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell response in all 54 and 44 positive
samples, respectively. Within the 54 responding samples, M-protein OPP induced a detectable
CD4+ T cell response in the highest number of samples (M=45, N=39, S=44), whereas for the
44 responding samples within CD8+ subsets, the S protein OPP was dominant (M=30, S=36,
N=30) (Fig. 1b-c). A similar observation was made for the middle eastern respiratory syndrome
corona virus (MERS)-virus, where a higher S-protein induced CD8+ T cell and higher M-protein
induced CD4+ T cells response were described15. Although the immunogenicity of the three
proteins and its role for the clinical course require follow up investigations, our data advocate
that measuring T cell responses induced by all three proteins is of high relevance when
studying SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells.
Comparing the magnitude of response against the three proteins, we also found that the
M-protein OPP induced the highest frequencies of reactive CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2a). Compared to
the S- and N-reactive CD4+ T cells we found a consistent trend of higher frequencies of Mreactive CD4+ T cells expressing cytokines and effector molecules such as interleukin (IL)-2,
interferon γ (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and granzyme B (GrzB) . N-protein induced
the lowest responses in comparison to the other proteins (Fig. 2b-f, Fig. S2). Despite the
differences in magnitude, there was a high correlation between the frequencies of S-, N-, and
M-reactive CD4+ T cells (Fig. 2g-i).
Interestingly, the pattern observed for S-, N-, and M-protein reactivity of CD4+ T cells were not
found in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2j-o). In fact, a tendency of higher frequencies of S- or N-protein
reactive CD8+ T cells compared to M-protein was observed, but without reaching statistical
significance after correction for multiple testing. Similar to CD4+ restricted immunity, we

observed a high correlation in frequencies of CD8+ T cells reactive to S-, N-, and M-proteins
(Fig 2p-r).
The exact role of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cell immunity for COVID-19 progression is currently
unknown. We therefore investigated differences in the T cell immunity between moderate,
severe and critical COVID-19 patients. A defective switch between innate and adaptive
immunity has been described to differentiate patients with favorable and unfavorable
outcome after SARS-CoV infection in previous studies16. Surprisingly, and in contrast to the
endemic SARS-CoV infection, we detected the highest magnitude of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
reactive to S-, M-, and N-proteins in critical COVID-19 (Fig. 3).
Examining a limited number of subjectively selected functions of virus-reactive T cells may
generate distorted and incomplete interpretation of the function and phenotype of these
cells17. Polyfunctional T cells, that express more than one cytokine or effector molecule, have
been described as a hallmark of protective immunity in viral infections17-19. Addressing this
point, we analyzed the IFNγ, TNFα, IL-2, and IL-4 cytokines as well as the effector molecule
GrzB expression in parallel to differentiation stage phenotyping. Of interest, not only the
quantity but also the functionality of T-cell immunity was superior in patients with critical
COVID-19 severity. Polyfunctional T cells showed higher frequencies in critical COVID-19
patients compared to moderate and severe cases (Fig. 3e,f,n,o). Antigen-reactive IFNγ-, IL2-,
and TNFα-producing CD4+ T cells constituted over 50% of trifunctional CD4+ T cells, while
cytotoxic GrzB-producing IFNγ- and TNFα-expressing CD4+ T cells constituted 25% of
trifunctional CD4+ T cells (Fig. S3b). The cytokine and effector molecule expression of
bifunctional CD4+ T cells was also dominated by IFNγ, TNFα, IL2, and to a lesser extend GrzB
(Fig. S3c). As expected, the majority of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells produced the cytotoxic
effector molecule GrzB, most commonly in combination with IFNγ and TNFα (Fig. S3b-c).
Despite the higher frequencies of single-, bi-, and trifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells found in
most T-cell subsets in critical cases, statistical significant differences were observed only for
few subsets. With respect to the relatively low sample numbers and multiple correction
testing, the lack of statistical significant differences is not surprising. As described above,
SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in our study were predominantly of TH1 phenotype. A TH2
dominated response was associated with immunopathology and - eosinophil infiltration after
vaccination with N-protein expressing vaccinia virus in a mouse SARS-CoV model20,21.

However, we have no indication of ongoing TH2 response in critical patients since only very
few IL4-producing T cells were observed in all samples (Fig. 2e-n).
In line with data showing an association between polyfunctionality and the stage of
phenotypic differentiation17, we observed higher frequencies of CD8+ T cells with effector
memory (TEM)/TEMRA phenotype in critical COVID-19 patients compared to moderate and
severe cases (Fig S4). Importantly, the presence of S-, N-, and M-reactive T-cells with an
advanced differentiation phenotype early after diagnosis in our study indicates pre-existing
cellular immunity as demonstrated in a recent study10.

Taken together, our data provide a comprehensive characterization of the T cell response
against S-, M- and N- SARS-CoV-2 proteins. To our best knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating immunogenicity of M- and N-proteins. The reactivity demonstrates individual
pattern, indicating that all three proteins should be considered in cellular monitoring to avoid
underestimation. Moreover, our findings suggest new potential targets of humoral immunity.
Considering the role of CD4+ T helper cells for antibody generation and the higher CD4+ T-cell
response against M-protein, our results highlight the M-protein as an additional target for
antibody monitoring and vaccine development.
Importantly, patients with critical COVID-19 demonstrated higher frequencies of CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cells reactive to S-, M, and N-OPP. Although the direct antiviral capacity has to be
proven in future studies, the polyfunctionality of the cells might confirm their antiviral
potential. To this end, the presence of IFNγ and TNFα coproducing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
indicating an effector/memory phenotype and long-term protection was also shown for the
2002/03 SARS-CoV22,23. Considering possible bias in our findings, time point of sample
collection and multiple samples per patients might influence our results. However, analyzing
only one sample per patients using the last visit sample for an optimized timing match, we did
not detect relevant differences to the analysis of all available samples (Fig. S4). We also did
not find any significant differences in the time after PCR-testing or after hospital admission
between the groups. Nevertheless, it needs to be considered that the time point of infection
in our cohort is, as in most similar studies, not known. The higher reactivity of T cells of
critically ill patients might therefore mirror a longer course of response against the infection.
Another explanation might be that the higher magnitude and functionality of the T-cell
response observed in critical COVID-19 cases might simply reflect a more severe infection

course with a stronger immunogenic environment, provided by a higher viral burden and
inflammatory bystander activation.
Independently of the reason for the higher magnitude and functionality of CD4 + and CD8+ T
cells in critical patients, our data demonstrate the ability of critical COVID-19 patients to
mount a sufficient cellular immunity. Although the observed TH1-dominanted polyfunctional
cells are commonly regarded as a parameter for protective immunity17,19,24, they can also
provide immune damage contributing to immunopathogenesis25. In this context, our finding
on advanced differentiation stage of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells found at early time points
raises the question about the beneficial effect of pre-existing immunity for the course of
infection. One could speculate that even though it appears to be generally protective, preexisting SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells with effector phenotype, which are cross-reactive with
common cold corona viruses10, in severe infection can lead to hyperactive response and
immunopathogenesis.
Although further studies are required to explore the pathogenesis of COVID-19 progression in
more details, our study enhances the understanding about the complex mechanisms of the
anti-SARS-COV-2 immunity that should be considered for diagnostic test and vaccine
development.

Methods
Study population and design
This investigation is an analysis of a sub-cohort of a larger study that was published earlier 4.
We recruited 28 patients with moderate (n=8), severe (n=10) and critical (n=10) COVID-19.
The degree of COVID-19 severity was evaluated according to the guidelines of the Robert Koch
Institute, Germany, as previously described4. The study was approved by the ethical
committee of the Ruhr-University Bochum (20-6886) and University Hospital Essen (20-9214BO), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The clinical and
demographic patient parameters are shown in Tables S1.
Patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 were recruited after the first symptoms were
reported and a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed the disease (in median 4 days after the
diagnostic test). The sampling time is presented in Table S2. For the main figures, all acquired
patient samples were analyzed. For Fig. S4, only the last sample of each patient was analyzed.
Samples were grouped into COVID-19 severity groups according to the symptom presentation
at time of sampling
Preparation of PBMCs and stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 overlapping peptide pools
SARS-CoV-2 PepTivator peptide pools (Miltenyi Biotec), consisting mainly of 15-mer
sequences with 11 amino acids (aa) overlap containing overlapping peptide pools (OPP)
spanning parts of the S-protein, or, covering the complete sequence of the N- and M-protein,
were used for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulation. PBMC were prepared
from EDTA collection tubes (Sarstedt) by gradient centrifugation. 2.5x106 PBMC were
stimulated with 1 µg/mL OPP for 16h in RPMI (Life Technologies) supplemented with 1%
Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamin (Sigma Aldrich) and 10% FCS (PAN-Biotech). Negative
controls were left untreated. Brefeldin A (1µg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) was added after 2h.
Flow cytometry
PBMC stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 OPP were surface stained with CCR7-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone
G043H7) (BioLegend), CD4-A700 (clone OKT4) (BioLegend), Fixable Viability Dye eFluor780
(eBioscience), CD8-V500 (clone RPA-T8) (BD Biosciences) and CD45RA-BV605 (clone HI100)
(BioLegend). After fixation and permeabilization (Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization
Buffer Set by Thermo Fisher Scientific) the cells were stained with Granzyme B-FITC (clone
GB11) (BioLegend), IL2-PE (clone MQ1-17H12) (BioLegend), IL4-PE-Dazzle594 (clone MP4-

25D2) (BioLegend), CD137 (4-1BB)-PE-Cy7 (clone 4B4-1) (BioLegend), CD154 (CD40L)-A647;
(clone 24-31) (BioLegend), TNFa-eFluor450 (clone MAb11) (eBioscience), IFNg-BV650 (clone
4S.B3) (BioLegend), CD3-BV785 (clone OKT3) (BioLegend). All samples were acquired on a
CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
Data analysis and graphical representation
Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.6.2 (BD Biosciences). Gating
strategies are presented in supplementary Fig. S2. Unspecific activation in unstimulated
controls was subtracted from stimulated samples to account for specific activation. Antigenspecific responses above 0.001% were considered positive. Negative values were set to zero.
Multifunctional T cells were analyzed using Boolean gating of IL2, IL4, IFNγ, TNFα, and GrzB
producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Statistical analysis was performed using R, version 3.6.226
and GraphPad Prism v7, which was also used for graphical representation. Venn diagrams
were prepared using Venny v2.127.
Non-parametric statistical tests were used where applicable. Patient age and time point of
sampling were compared with Kruskal-Wallis-Test. Patient gender was compared with Fisher’s
exact test. Differences in T cells responses of all patient samples together were analyzed with
Friedman test and Dunn’s multiple comparison test. As sphericity was not assumed, GeisserGreenhouse correction was applied. Correlation between the T cell responses towards the
different peptides was analyzed by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Differences in T
cell responses of patient samples grouped according to COVID-19 severity were analyzed by
repeated-measurement two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Bivariate
regression analysis was performed to exclude potential bias in the analysis due to the
unbalanced gender distribution of the groups. Thus, for factors significantly associated with
illness severity, regression analysis was performed with gender and COVID-19 severity as
independent variables, without interactions. P values below 0.05 were considered significant;
only significant P values are reported.

Figure legends
Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells are induced by the S-, M- and N- protein with interindividual pattern
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 57 blood samples of a total of 28 COVID-19
patients with moderate, severe or critical disease were stimulated for 16 hours with S-, M-, or
N-protein OPP. Antigen-reactive T cells were determined by flow cytometry and identified
according to the gating strategy presented in supplementary figure S2.
a) Representative plots of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells after stimulation with S-, M-, and Nprotein overlapping peptide pools for 16h. Antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells were identified by
CD154 and CD137 expression and antigen-reactive CD8+ T cells by CD137 expression.
b) Frequency of patient samples with detectable CD4+ (top) and CD8+ (bottom) T cell
responses after stimulation with S-, M-, or N-protein (total of 57 samples of 28 patients).
c) Venn diagrams of 57 patient samples with detectable SARS-Cov-2-reactive CD4+ or CD8+ T
cells after stimulation with S-, M- or N-protein. Antigen-specific responses above 0.001% of
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were considered as response. 54 samples within CD4+ T-cells and 44
samples within CD8+ T-cells showed T cell reactivity towards at least one of the tested SARSCoV-2-S, M, and N-proteins
Figure 2: SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells show a higher M-protein reactivity in CD4+ T cells and
S- and N-protein reactivity in CD8+ T cells
57 blood samples of a total of 28 COVID-19 patients were drawn at one or at multiple time
points within one week after diagnosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated
for 16h with S-, M-, or N-protein overlapping peptide pools. The gating strategy is presented
in Fig. S2.
a-f) Frequencies of (a) CD154+ CD137+ CD4+ T cells (antigen-specific CD4+ T cells), (b) interferon
γ (IFNγ)-, (c) tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-, (d) interleukin (IL) 2-, (e) IL4-, and (f) granzyme
B (GrzB)-producing antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Statistical analysis was performed with
Friedman test for non-parametric data and Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Whiskers were
calculated with the Tukey method.
g-i) Correlation of M-, N- and S-protein OPP reactive (CD154+ CD137+) CD4+ T cells.
Calculation was performed with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.
j-l) Frequencies of (j) CD137+ CD8+ T cells (antigen-specific CD8+ T cells), (k) IFNγ-, (l) TNFα-,
(m) IL2-, (n) IL4-, and (o) GrzB-producing antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Statistical analysis was
performed with Friedman test for non-parametric data and Dunn’s multiple comparison test.
Whiskers were calculated with the Tukey method.
p-r) Correlation of M-, N- and S-protein reactive (CD137+) CD8+ T cells. Calculation was
performed with Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient.

Figure 3: Critical COVID-19 patients mount a strong SARS-CoV-2 S-, M-, and N-proteinreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response
57 blood samples of a total of 28 COVID-19 patients were drawn at one or at multiple time
points within one week after diagnosis. COVID-19 severity was assessed at the time of
sampling as per the guidelines of the German Robert-Koch-Institute and samples grouped
accordingly (n=28 moderate, n=16 severe and n=13 critical samples). Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were stimulated for 16h with S-, M-, or N-protein overlapping peptide pools
