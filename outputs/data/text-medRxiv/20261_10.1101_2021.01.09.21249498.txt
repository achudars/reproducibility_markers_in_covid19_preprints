ABSTRACT

22

Objective

23

Bacterial infections are known to complicate respiratory viral infections and are associated with

24

adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. A case control study was conducted to determine risk

25

factors for bacterial infections where cases were defined as moderate to severe/critical COVID-19

26

patients with bacterial infection and those without were included as controls. Logistic regression

27

analysis was performed.

28

Results

29

Out of a total of 50 cases and 50 controls, greater proportion of cases had severe or critical

30

disease at presentation as compared to control i.e 80% vs 30% (p<0.001). Hospital acquired

31

pneumonia (72%) and Gram negative organisms (82%) were predominant. Overall antibiotic

32

utilization was 82% and was 64% in patients who had no evidence of bacterial infection. The

33

median length of stay was significantly longer among cases compared to controls (12.5 versus 7.5

34

days) (p=0.001). The overall mortality was 30%, with comparatively higher proportion of deaths

35

among cases (42% versus 18%) (p=0.009). Severe or critical COVID-19 at presentation (AOR: 4.42

36

times; 95% CI; 1.63-11.9) and use of steroids (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI 1.24-17.05) were independently

37

associated with risk of bacterial infections. These findings have implications for antibiotic

38

stewardship as antibiotics can be reserved for those at higher risk for bacterial superinfections.

INTRODUCTION

43

to be determined. Respiratory viral infections have been well known to predispose patients to co-

44

infections and these lead to increased disease severity and mortality as was observed in 1918

45

influenza outbreak, where most mortalities were due to simultaneous bacterial infection.[1]

46

Bacterial co-infection also led to poor outcome in 2009H1N1 influenza pandemic.[2]

47

The incidence of bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 ranges from 3-30% [3, 4]. Zhou and colleagues

48

showed that in the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, 50% of patients who

49

died, had secondary bacterial infections, while another study showed presence of both bacterial

50

and fungal infection [5, 6]. Due to similar clinical phenotype and difficulties in identifying COVID-

51

19 disease from atypical bacterial pneumonia or nosocomial pneumonia some guidelines advise

52

empirical antibiotics [7]. In a study conducted at 38 hospitals in Michigan 56.6% patients received

53

empirical antibiotics therapy[8].

54

Studies indicate that bacterial co-infection and secondary infection complicate COVID-19 though

55

regional data is scarce[6]. Moreoverrisk factors for these infections need to be better elucidated.

56

Antimicrobials are used empirically which may lead to antimicrobial resistance in the long term.

57

Hence, it is imperative to conduct comparative studies to identify those COVID-19 patients who

58

are candidates for empirical antibiotic therapy and curtail widespread injudicious use of

59

antibiotics.The purpose of this study is to determine the risk factors of bacterial infections in

60

patients and characterization of these infections along with the sensitivity patterns of isolated

61

organisms in patients presenting with moderate to severe/critical COVID-19.

COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 1,000,000 lives to date and its long term impact is yet

MAIN TEXT

63
64

METHODS
A case control study was conducted from February 2020 to June 2020 at a tertiary care center in

65

Karachi, Pakistan. Cases were defined as patients who had PCR confirmed moderate to

66

severe/critical COVID-19 as per WHO criteria for severity and had evidence of bacterial infection

67

based on isolation of bacteria in any of the culture specimens collected during admission along

68

with symptoms and signs consistent with infection. Controls were defined as patients who had

69

PCR confirmed moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 as per WHO criteria for severity but who did

70

not develop bacterial infection during admission.

71

All adult patients (age >=18 years) hospitalized with moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 as per

72

WHO definition for severity [9] at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were assessed for

73

presence of bacterial co-infection at admission as well as followed for secondary bacterial

74

infection during hospitalization. Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with bacterial

75

infection during hospitalization with COVID-19 at various sites such as urinary tract infection,

76

hospital acquired pneumonia, ventilator associated pneumonia, central line associated blood-

77

stream infection etc. as defined by CDC [10] and who were identified to have growth of significant

78

bacteria in the respective appropriate culture specimens (e.g urine, tracheal aspirate, blood from

79

central line etc) collected during admission were included whereas those patients who had

80

evidence of bacterial infection on culture but did not have signs and symptoms consistent with

81

infection at any site as defined by CDC [10] were considered to be colonized and excluded from

82

study and patients with mono-microbial fungal infections were also excluded.

83

Patients who had any positive bacterial culture were identified from infection control records and

84

were screened for eligibility criteria for cases. Controls were identified from medical records among

85

all moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 admissions. A sample size of 50 cases was obtained. For

86

each case patient, 1:1 control patient(s) was also obtained (50 controls). Main outcome variable was

87

presence of bacterial infection defined as infection with clinically significant bacteria which is

88

identified from a culture specimen among those with moderate or severe/critical COVID-19.

89

Exposure variables included patient related factors such as age in years, gender, comorbidities, type

90

of ward/unit to which patient was admitted, presence of invasive devices and immunosuppression

91

received. We collected data on potential confounders including previous co-morbids and severity of

92

illness. Data was collected on structured proforma which was pretested for one week at the start of

93

the study. Patients were further stratified as having community-onset infection if they had culture

94

specimen positive within 72 hours of admission and hospital-onset infection if they were found to

95

have a bacterial infection after 72 hours of hospitalization. Bacteriological identification was

96

performed in College of American Pathologists (CAP) certified Clinical Microbiology laboratory at Aga

97

Khan University by conventional methods. Antibiotic susceptibility of isolated bacteria was evaluated

98

by the standard disc diffusion method in accordance with the Clinical & Laboratory Standards

99

Institute (CLSI) recommendations.

100

Statistical analysis

101

Frequencies with percentages were reported for categorical variables such as gender, type of

102

infection by site, etc. according to case or control status. For continuous variables such as age,

103

length of stay etc. median and interquartile range were reported by case and control status.

104

Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between risk factors and

105

bacterial infection in moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 patients and the results were

106

reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. P-value 0.05 was considered

107

significant. Data was analyzed using Stata version 12.

108

The study received an exemption from ethical approval from the Aga Khan University Ethics

109

Review Committee (ERC reference number: 2020-5178-14123).

110
111

RESULTS
A total of 50 cases and 50 controls were included in the analysis after making relevant exclusions

112

over a period of 4 months from February to June 2020. Median age of cases was 58 years (IQR)

113

and of controls was 62 years (IQR). The overall male to female ratio was 2.8 and gender

114

distribution was similar between the groups. The most frequent co-morbids were diabetes and

115

hypertension in both groups. The severity of illness was significantly different in both the groups

116

with a high proportion (80%) of severe/critical COVID-19 patients among cases compared to 30%

117

in controls (p<0.001). Among those COVID-19 patients with bacterial infections, the majority (72%)

118

was hospital-acquired and 28% were community-acquired at onset and the commonest site of

119

infection was hospital-acquired pneumonia (Figure 1). Nine out of 50 had bacteremia. Gram-

120

negative infections were more common (82%) than gram-positive infections. The most frequently

121

isolated organism from sputum specimens was multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter species in 27%,

122

followed by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeroginosa in 25% (Figure 2). Among patients with

123

community-acquired infections, the most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (5/14) in

124

which four were methicillin-resistant and extended spectrum beta lactamase producing (ESBL)

125

Klebsiella pneumoniae in (9/14). Majority of patients had a mono-microbial infection (70%). Seven

126

out of 50 patients had simultaneous infection at two sites.

127

Among laboratory investigations, the median C-reactive protein and median neutrophil to

128

lymphocyte ratio were significantly higher in cases compared to controls (Table 1). However, there

129

was no statistically significant difference between procalcitonin levels in COVID-19 patients with

130

bacterial infection compared to those without bacterial infection (p=0.883). With regard to the

131

unit of admission, COVID-19 patients with bacterial infections were more frequently admitted to

132

the Intensive care unit (56%) compared to patients without bacterial infections who were mostly

133

admitted to the ward (38%) (p<0.001). The use of invasive devices such as endotracheal tube and

134

central venous catheters were also more frequent among cases compared to controls (p<0.001)

135

(Table 1). Patients with bacterial infections were managed with invasive ventilation in 56% of

136

cases compared to 14% controls (p<0.001) and with non-invasive ventilation in 64% of cases

137

compared to 34% controls (p=0.003). Comparatively higher proportion of patients who had

138

bacterial infections had received treatment with systemic steroids (92%) (p=0.001). All patients

139

with bacterial infections had received antibiotics and among controls (32/50) had received

140

antibiotics. The choice of empiric antibiotics was based on local antibiogram and institutional

141

guidelines for community acquired pneumonia and definitive antibiotic treatment was decided

142

based on identification and sensitivity pattern of the isolated organism. The overall mortality was

143

30%. Patients with COVID-19 having bacterial infections had a comparatively greater proportion of

144

deaths (42% versus 18%) (p=0.009). Out of 21 patients who died, 18 had infection with gram

145

negative organism with Acinetobacter sp (n=9) and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (n=7) being most

146

common isolates. The median length of stay was also significantly longer among cases compared

147

to controls (12.5 versus 7.5 days) (p=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression showed that patients

148

who were severe to critically ill at the time of admission with COVID-19 were 4.42 times (95% CI;

1.63-11.9) at risk for bacterial infection and treatment with steroids was also a significant risk

150

factor (AOR: 4.60; 95% CI 1.24-17.05). Admission to ward unit was found to be protective (OR:

151

0.15; 95% CI 0.02-0.75).

152
153

DISCUSSION
Our study found that there is a significant association of severity of illness with COVID-19 at

154

presentation and treatment with steroids with the development of superimposed bacterial

155

infection. Our patient cohort had moderate to severe or critical COVID-19 at the time of

156

hospitalization and we had excluded patients who had specimen positive with contaminants or

157

who were presumed to be colonized and without clinically significant infection. There was a high

158

male to the female ratio and several studies have reported a greater risk of severe illness with

159

COVID-19 in males compared to females [11, 12]. We had very few community-acquired infections

160

and the majority were hospital-acquired. This is similar to study conducted by Hughes et al. from

161

UK where only 3.2% co-infections were reported [13] and a study from Spain describing the

162

incidence of co-infections [14]. This was also confirmed in a meta-analysis where the reported

163

prevalence of co-infections was 3.5% [15]. Majority of the patients in our cohort developed

164

hospital acquired infections. This is consistent with other reported literature [15, 16]. The most

165

common site of infection was pneumonia and this is in concordance with initial reports from China

166

[16]. Gram-negative infections have dominated as far as the type of organisms is concerned and

167

this is similarly seen in studies reported from other parts of the world describing superinfections

168

or secondary bacterial infections [14, 16]. There is a lack of reported literature on the sensitivity

169

patterns of organisms isolated. In our study, we found multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter as the

170

predominant pathogen causing hospital acquired infections and methicillin resistant

171

Staphylococcus aureus as the main cause of co-infection in COVID-19 in our patients. A case series

172

of 19 patients from Iran has described Acinetobacter baumanii in majority of patients requiring

173

ICU admission[17] which reflects epidemiological similarity to Pakistan. In our study, the overall

174

mortality was 30% and was higher in those who had bacterial infections. This is also consistent

175

with data reported from Europe and parts of Asia [15, 18]. Moreover, we found that overall

176

antibiotic utilization was 82% and was 64% in patients who had no evidence of bacterial infection.

177

This has also been similarly reported [18] indicating widespread injudicious use of antibiotics

178

which can potentiate the problem of antimicrobial resistance. In our study, we did not find

179

procalcitonin to be a reliable marker of distinguishing patients who had bacterial infections and

180

those who did not have bacterial infections. Although studies have described procalcitonin levels

181

to remain normal in severe COVID-19, whether they increase in bacterial infections has not been

182

reported and indicates need of large comparative studies exploring this relationship[19]. Our

183

study is the first comparative study with regard to bacterial infections in the setting of moderate

184

and severe to critical COVID-19 and describes the sensitivity pattern of organisms in addition to

185

clearly classifying them into community and hospital acquired infections.

186

Conclusions

187

Our study highlights need for improving antibiotic stewardship practices and reserving antibiotics

188

for those who are severely ill with COVID-19 at presentation and require treatment with systemic

189

steroids and provides insight into the lack of utility of serum procalcitonin as a marker of bacterial

190

sepsis in this setting.

LIMITATIONS

193

Moreover, we did not have molecular methods and genotyping available for our bacterial isolates

194

and information on the isolation rate of the prevalent Gram negatives and MRSA in non-COVID-19

195

patients over the study period was not available to draw comparisons with rates of infection seen

196

in COVID-19 patients.

Our study is limited as it’s a single center experience which might affect generalizability.
