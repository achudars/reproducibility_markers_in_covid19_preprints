ABSTRACT

34

Background

35

There remains limited data on what variables affect risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and developing

36

symptomatic Covid-19 and in particular the relationship to viral load (VL). We analysed data from linked

37

index cases and their contacts to explore factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

38

Methods

39

Patients were recruited as part of a randomized control trial ,conducted between March to April 2020, that

40

aimed to assess if hydroxychloroquine reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Non-hospitalised Covid-19

41

cases and their contacts were identified through the local surveillance system. VL, measured by

42

quantitative PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab, was assessed at enrollment, at day 14, and whenever the

43

participant reported Covid-19-like symptoms. Risk of transmission, developing symptomatic disease and

44

incubation dynamics were evaluated using regression analysis.

45

Findings

46

We identified 314 cases, 282 of which had at least one contact (753 contacts in total). Ninety (33%) of

47

282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 16% (125/753), with a

48

variation from 12% to 24% for VL of the index case of <106, and >109 copies/mL, respectively (OR per

49

log10 increase in VL 1.3 95%CI 1.1–1.6). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with

50

household contact (OR 2.7; 1.4–5.06) and age of the contact (OR 1.02 per year; 1.01–1.04). The

51

proportion of PCR positive contacts who developed symptomatic Covid-19 was 40.3% (181/449), with a

52

variation from 25% to 60% for VL of the contact <107, and >109 copies/mL (HR log10 increase in VL

53

1.12; 95% CI 1.05 – 1.2). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR

54

5–10) for individuals with an initial viral load <107 to 6 days (4–8) and 5 days (3–8) for individuals with

55

an initial viral load of 107–109 and >109, respectively.

56

Interpretation

57

Viral load of index cases is a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The risk of symptomatic

58

Covid-19 is strongly associated with viral load of contacts at baseline and shortens the incubation time in

59

a dose-dependent manner.

Research in context

65

Evidence before this study

66

In September 2020, we searched PubMed database for articles reporting on factors influencing

67

transmission and the risk of developing symptomatic disease. Search terms included “Covid-19”, “SARS-

68

CoV-2”, “transmission”, “incubation time”, and “risk”, with no language restrictions. By 20th September,

69

various authors had reported on retrospective analyses of clusters of index cases and their corresponding

70

contacts, as well as series of patients who developed symptomatic Covid-19 disease after PCR positive

71

result. Besides describing the secondary attack rate, various authors identified risk factors for

72

transmission associated with the place and duration of exposure and the lack of use of personal protective

73

equipment. A single study suggested that symptomatic individuals might be more likely to transmit than

74

asymptomatic cases but we found no clear evidence regarding the influence of viral load of the index case

75

on transmission risk. Similarly, although various retrospective series of patients with positive PCR results

76

had reported incubation times elsewhere, the characteristics of index case and contacts that may influence

77

the risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 and the time to this event had been barely addressed.

78

Added value of this study

79

We analyzed data from a large cluster-randomized clinical trial on post-exposure therapy for Covid-19

80

that provide new information on SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Several design components add

81

value to this dataset. Notably, quantitative PCR was available for the index cases to estimate risk of

82

transmission. Furthermore, quantitative PCR was also performed on asymptomatic contacts at the time of

83

enrollment allowing to investigate the dynamics of symptomatic disease onset among them. We found

84

that the viral load of the index case was the leading determinant of the risk of SARS-CoV-2 PCR

85

positivity among contacts. Among contacts who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive at baseline, viral load

86

significantly influenced the risk of developing the symptomatic disease in a dose-dependent manner. This

87

influence also became apparent in the incubation time, which shortened with increasing baseline viral

88

loads.

Implication of all the available evidence

90

Our results provide important insights into the knowledge regarding the risk of SARS-CoV-2

91

transmission and Covid-19 development. The fact that the transmission risk is primarily driven by the

92

viral load of index cases, more than other factors such as their symptoms or age, suggests that all cases

93

should be considered potential transmitters irrespective of their presentation and encourages assessing

94

viral load in cases with a larger number of close contacts. Similarly, our results regarding the risk and

95

expected time to developing symptomatic Covid-19 encourage risk stratification of newly diagnosed

96

SARS-CoV-2 infections based on the initial viral load.

INTRODUCTION

100

According to current evidence, Covid-19 is primarily transmitted from person to person through

101

respiratory droplets, as well as indirect contact, through transfer of the virus from contaminated fomites to

102

the mouth, nose, or eyes.1,2 As with most respiratory viral infections there is likely to be some

103

contribution from smaller aerosols but their relative contribution compared to droplets remains unclear.

104

Several outbreak investigation reports have shown that Covid-19 transmission can be particularly

105

effective in confined indoor spaces such as workplaces including factories, churches, restaurants,

106

shopping centers, or healthcare settings.3–6 In Spain, and many other countries, healthcare workers have

107

experienced a high rate of Covid-19 infection.7

108

The availability of data regarding the factors that may enhance transmission is essential for designing

109

interventions to control SARS-CoV-2 spread. Currently available data provide information on the risk of

110

transmission related to the place and duration of exposure, and the use of respiratory and eye protection1,3–

111

5,8

112

of infection, the virus has been identified in respiratory tract specimens 1–2 days before the onset of

113

symptoms, and it can persist for prolonged periods over several weeks after the onset of symptoms in

114

mild cases.9 However, the detection of viral RNA by PCR does not necessarily equate with infectivity,

115

and the exact relationship between viral load and risk of transmission from a case is still not clear.10,11

116

Studies investigating case-contact pairs have reported highly variable secondary attack rates (i.e., range

117

0.7% to 75%), depending on the type of exposure duration, place, pre- or post-symptomatic.12–15

118

Another challenge for public health interventions is the risk stratification of infected individuals for

119

developing symptomatic illness. On the other hand, a living systematic review estimated that the

120

proportion of PCR-positive infected contacts that progress to symptomatic disease is approximately 70-

121

80%.16,17 Estimates of mean or median incubation period have been consistently between 5–7 days.18–20

122

Whilst there has been a suggestion that viral load of cases may potentially be associated with risk of

123

disease or transmission there is currently no published data directly addressing this question and little is

124

known about factors that may contribute to variation on the risk of developing Covid-19 symptoms or the

125

incubation periods among infected individuals.

126

The overall aim of this study was to evaluate transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of a

127

trial of post-exposure prophylaxis. Specifically, the objectives of the study were threefold: (a) to

128

investigate the association between clinical and demographic features of cases and viral load, (b) to

129

evaluate the effect of viral load on SARS-CoV-2 transmission to close contacts, and (c) to determine the

130

influence of viral load in the exposed on development of symptoms and on the incubation period.

but not on other factors related to the characteristics of index cases and their contacts. Over the course

METHODS

132

Study design

133

This was a post-hoc analysis of data collected in the BCN PEP CoV-2 Study (NCT04304053), a cluster-

134

randomized trial that included PCR-confirmed Covid-19 cases and their close contacts. The trial occurred

135

between Mar 17 to Apr 28, 2020, during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, in three out of nine healthcare areas

136

in Catalonia (North-East Spain): Catalunya central, Àmbit Metropolità Nord, and Barcelona Ciutat, total

137

target population 4,206,440 people. The study protocol of the BCN PEP CoV-2 Study was approved by

138

the ethics committee of Hospital Germans Trias Pujol, (Badalona, Spain). Written informed consent was

139

obtained from all participants. Full details of the original study are reported elsewhere.21

140

Covid-19 cases were identified using the electronic registry of the Epidemiological Surveillance

141

Emergency Service of Catalonia (SUVEC) of the Department of Health.22 Following government

142

ordinance, the SUVEC registered all new Covid-19 diagnoses occurred from March 16, 2020. The

143

surveillance system included active tracing of all contacts with recent history of exposure, defined as

144

being in contact with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive case during more than 15 minutes within two meters.

145

All Covid-19 cases included in the present analysis were non-hospitalized adults (i.e.,

146

with quantitative PCR result available at baseline, mild symptom onset within five days before

147

enrollment, and no reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections in their accommodation (i.e.,

148

household or nursing home) or workplace within the 14 days before enrollment. Contacts selected for the

149

analysis were adults with a recent history of exposure and absence of Covid-19-like symptoms within the

150

seven days preceding enrolment. Contacts were exposed to the index case as either a healthcare worker, a

151

household contact, a nursing home worker, or a nursing home resident.

152

Study procedures and data collection

153

A dedicated outbreak field team visited cases and contacts at home or nursing home on days 1

154

(enrollment) and 14. At the first clinical assessment on day 1 they conducted a baseline assessment,

155

including a questionnaire for symptoms of Covid-19 and collected relevant epidemiological information

156

using a structured interview: time of first exposure to the index case, place of contact (hospital, home,

157

nursing care facility), routine use of a mask of both when in close proximity to the index case, the case

158

and the contact, and sleep location concerning the index case (e.g., same room, same house). Symptoms

159

surveillance consisted of active monitoring by phone on days 3, and 7, a home visit on day 14, and

160

passive monitoring whenever the participants developed symptoms. Participants who developed

161

symptoms were visited the same day they notified symptom onset (unscheduled visits) by the field team,

≥ 18 years of age)

162

which recorded the date of symptom onset, type of symptoms from a pre-specified checklist, and

163

symptom severity, graded on a 1-to-4 scale.

164

Serial SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and viral load titration on nasopharyngeal swab were conducted on day 1

165

and day 14 to all participants, and on any unscheduled visit when the participant notified the onset of

166

Covid-19 symptoms. The detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was performed from nasopharyngeal swabs

167

at SYNLAB Diagnostics (Barcelona, Spain) by PCR using TaqMan™ 2019-nCoV Assay Kit according to

168

the manufacturer’s protocol (Catalog number: A47532, Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc.). Viral load was

169

quantified from nasopharyngeal swabs at IrsiCaixa laboratory (Badalona, Spain) by PCR amplification,

170

based on the 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel guidelines and protocol

171

developed by the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).23 For absolute

172

quantification, a standard curve was built using 1/5 serial dilutions of a SARS-CoV2 plasmid (2019-

173

nCoV_N_Positive Control, catalog no. 10006625, 2x105 copies/ L, Integrated DNA Technologies) and

174

run in parallel to all PCR determinations.

175

Outcomes and definitions

176

Transmission was characterized by examining the number of infected and uninfected individuals among

177

close contacts to an index case. We defined transmission events as PCR-positivity at any time point (i.e.,

178

days 1, 14, or at any other unscheduled PCR testing when participants referred symptoms) of a contact in

179

the same household or workplace within the 14 days following enrollment. We defined the secondary

180

attack rate of viral transmission as the ratio of PCR-positive individuals among close contacts, according

181

to the WHO guidelines.

182

Development to symptomatic disease was defined as presence of at least one of the following symptoms:

183

fever, cough, difficulty breathing, myalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste disorder(s), or

184

diarrhea) and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test. The incubation period was defined as time from first

185

exposure to symptom onset, with later confirmation of infection by PCR.24 The earliest possible exposure

186

with the symptomatic index case was determined for each contact individually.

188

We selected all eligible individuals within the original trial population for each of the three analyses

189

conducted in the current study. As in the original trial there was no evidence of an impact of

190

hydroxychloroquine on either transmission or development of symptomatic disease we included

191

individuals in both arms of the trial in the current study. Firstly, all Covid-19 cases with quantitative PCR

192

data were included in an analysis of the association between clinical and demographic features of cases

193

and viral load. Secondly, we identified factors associated with transmission using all clusters of an index

194

case (i.e., a Covid-19 case with at least one close contact) and their corresponding contacts for which

195

quantitative viral load was available for the index case. Finally, we assessed the risk of developing

196

symptomatic disease and the variation in the incubation period amongst all contacts with a positive PCR

197

result at baseline, irrespective of available data of their index case.

198

Statistical Analysis

199

We used log transformed viral loads which were approximately normally distributed and which also align

200

with common reporting norms. The relationship between characteristics of cases and viral load was

201

assessed using linear regression considering age (in years), sex, the number of days from reported

202

symptom onset and the presence of absence of five key clinical features namely fever, cough, shortness of

203

breath or rhinitis and anosmia. To identify risk factors for transmission, we used logistic regression model

204

for the risk of transmission utilizing a random-effect model to allow for within cluster variation in the risk

205

of transmission. Factors with potential influence on the risk of transmission included characteristics of the

206

potential transmitter (i.e., age, sex, viral load, and the presence or absence of respiratory symptoms) and

207

contacts (i.e., age, sex, and the type of contact they had with the index case). Finally the risk of

208

developing symptomatic Covid-19 was assessed by fitting a cox-regression model considering the age (in

209

years) and sex of the individual, the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory

210

disease and the initial viral load in relation to the time to development of symptomatic disease. Data at 14

211

days after the first study visit were censored, in line with the follow-up conducted in the original trial. All

212

analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.

213

Role of the funding source

214

The funder of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation,

215

or writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility

216

for the decision to submit for publication.

RESULTS

219

Sample characteristics

220

During the investigation period, we identified 314 cases in whom the viral load was tested. Overall, 220

221

(70.0%) were female and the median age was 41 (IQR 31-52). Of them, 282 had at least one close

222

contact, resulting in the corresponding clusters, with a total of 753 contacts. Clusters had a median of 2

223

contacts (IQR 1-3) and a maximum of 19 contacts. Most index cases of the clusters were female (n= 202,

224

71.6%), with an average age of 42 years (SD 13 years) (Table 1).

225

Index case viral load

226

The first study visit was performed a median of 4 days (IQR 3 -5) after symptom onset. At the first study

227

visit, the mean viral load amongst Covid-19 cases was 108 (101.8). In multivariable linear regression the

228

viral load amongst cases was higher in individuals who reported fever (Table 2) and negatively associated

229

with the presence of anosmia but there was no association between the age or sex of the Covid-19 case

230

nor the presence of reported dyspnea or cough. As anticipated viral load was negatively associated with

231

the number of days since symptom onset.

232

Cluster-level transmission

233

For our risk factor analysis on SARS-CoV-2 transmission we used linked case and contact data of 282

234

clusters with 753 contacts. At the cluster level, 90 (33.3%) of the 282 clusters had at least one

235

transmission event, with a highly skewed distribution of the number of transmission events per cluster

236

(Figure 1A). The first visit for contacts took place a median of 5 days (IQR 4-7 days) after their first

237

possible exposure to the index case. A total of 125 (16.6%) of 753 contacts had a PCR positive result over

238

the study period. The proportion of contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 within a cluster

239

(secondary attack rate) progressively increased with the viral load of the index case: from 12% where the

240

index case had a viral load of <106 copies/mL to 24% where the index case had a viral load >109

241

copies/mL (Figure 1B). According to the multivariate analysis, the viral load of the index case was

242

strongly associated with the risk of onward transmission (OR per log10 increase in VL 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-

243

1.6) (Table 3). Ninety percent (114/125) of transmission events had an index case viral load of 5.1 log10

244

copies/ml or more, and 50% (61/125) had a viral load of 8.8 log10 copies/ml or more. Other factors

245

associated with an increased risk of transmission were household contact (OR 2.7, 95% 1.4-5.06) and age

246

of the contact (OR 1.02, 95% 1.01-1.04). There was no association of risk of transmission with reported

247

mask usage by contacts, with the age or gender of the index case nor with the presence of respiratory

248

symptoms in the index case at the initial study visit (Table 3).

249

We did not find any evidence of an association between the viral load of the index cases and the first viral

250

load of incident positive results amongst contacts (p = 0.1, Supplementary Appendix) and this remained

251

true when adjusting for both the day of illness on which the index cases baseline viral load was measured

252

and the number of days until the contact was enrolled (p = 0.18). Also, after excluding contacts who were

253

PCR positive at the first study visit, we found no association between the viral load of the index case and

254

the time to onset of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.01 95% CI 0.83-1.23).

255

Risk factor for Covid-19 disease among PCR+ contacts

256

Overall, 449 contacts had a positive PCR result at first visit regardless of availability on viral load data of

257

their index case (n=125) or not (n=324). Twenty-eight (6.3%) of 449 contacts had symptoms at the first

258

visit and 181 (40.3%) developed symptomatic Covid-19 within the follow-up period. The multivariable

259

cox-regression analysis, after adjusting for age and sex, revealed that increasing viral load levels of the

260

contact at day 1 were associated with an increased risk of developing symptomatic disease. The risk of

261

symptomatic disease was approximately 25% amongst individuals with an initial viral load of <107

262

copies/mL compared to a more than 60% amongst those with an initial viral load of >109 (HR per log10

263

increase in VL 1.12; 95% CI 1.05 – 1.2; p = 0.0006) (Figure 2A). In the multivariable analysis there was

264

no association between sex or age of individuals nor the presence of diabetes, cardiovascular or

265

respiratory disease and the risk or time to developing symptomatic Covid-19.

266

The median time from exposure to symptom onset was 7 days (IQR 5 – 9). The time to onset of

267

symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5 – 10) for individuals with an initial viral

268

load <107 copies/mL to 6 days (IQR 4 – 8) and 5 days (IQR 3 – 8) for individuals with an initial viral load

269

of 107-109 and >109 copies/mL, respectively (Figure 2B). Overall, 110/181 (60.8%) of participants who

270

developed symptoms did so before day 8, 45/181 (24.9%) between days 8-10, and 22/181 (12.2%)

271

between days 11-14.

DISCUSSION

274

In our study, we found that increasing viral load values in nasopharyngeal swabs of Covid-19 cases were

275

associated with the greater risk of transmission measured by SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity among

276

contacts and also a higher risk of transmission in household environment compared to other indoor

277

situations. In addition, we found that higher viral loads in swabs of asymptomatic contacts were

278

associated with higher risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 and have shorter incubation periods than

279

those with a lower viral load. Relationships between viral load and infectivity have been described for

280

other respiratory viruses and our study confirms the same is true for SARS-CoV-2.

To our knowledge this is the largest study that evaluates the relationship of viral load in Covid-19 cases

282

and risk of transmission. In our cohort, a high proportion (67%) of index cases did not cause secondary

283

infections. However, we identified 90 (33%) clusters with transmission events and the multivariate

284

analysis revealed that clusters centered on index cases with high viral load were significantly more likely

285

to result in transmission. Secondary attack rate was under 12% when the index case viral load was <106

286

copies/ml compared to more than 20% amongst clusters with the highest viral loads. In line with previous

287

analyses of case-contact clusters,9,12,14 we also found that household exposure to an index case was

288

associated with a higher risk of transmission that other types of contact, presumably reflecting duration

289

and proximity of exposure. Age of the contact was also identified in our multivariate analysis as a

290

significant

291

results reported elsewhere, but seems to play a secondary role among adults.13,14 Finally, unlike previous

292

analyses that reported a relationship between coughing and transmission,13 we did not find any

293

association. This finding suggests that the absence of cough does not preclude significant onward

294

transmission, particularly if the viral load is high. Taken together, our results indicate that the viral load,

295

rather than symptoms, may be the predominant driver of transmission.

296

Importantly, we report that high viral short after exposure in asymptomatic contacts was strongly

297

associated with the risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 disease. We found an approximately 25%

298

chance of developing symptomatic disease amongst individuals with an initial viral load <107 copies/mL

299

compared to a more than 60% chance amongst individuals with a viral load >109. These data may provide

300

rationale for risk stratification for developing illness. Moreover, the initial viral load significantly shifted

301

the incubation time, which ranged from 5 days in participants with a high viral load to 7 days in

302

participants with a low viral load. Our study is the first analysis of prospective data that investigates the

303

association between initial viral load and the incubation time.

304

The study has several limitations. First, asymptomatic people were not enrolled as index cases, affecting

305

our ability to fully characterize all types of transmission chain. Second, we did not find any evidence of

306

decreased risk of transmission in individuals who reported mask use. While this finding collides with the

307

evidence reported elsewhere,8 we did not have fine-grained data on type of mask (surgical vs FFP2), use

308

of other measures of PPE or other infection control practices, thus limiting our ability to make clear

309

inferences about the impact of PPE on transmission risk. Mask usage is likely correlated with type of

310

exposure which might further confound associations but we did not note any association between mask

311

use and risk either in our unadjusted analysis (Table 3) or in a multivariable model excluding type of

312

exposure (data not shown). Third, we used time to symptom onset (with later confirmation of infection)

313

rather than time to positive PCR test based on serial testing. Nonetheless, accurate calculation of the

―albeit modest―determinant of transmission. This factor has shown uneven influence across

314

incubation period was feasible because of the prospective nature of the study, accurate identification of

315

exposure by face-to-face interview, and intensive active and passive monitoring of exposed contacts. We

316

followed participants over 14-day periods, thus incubation periods beyond 14 days may not have been

317

detected. Within each cluster we cannot be completely certain about the directionality of transmission, but

318

our inclusion criteria including the absence of Covid-19 like symptoms in the 2 weeks proceeding

319

enrolment is consistent with transmission from a case to a contact. We also cannot exclude that some

320

individuals may have been infected by individuals outside of study clusters, but as per national guidelines

321

all contacts were quarantined after exposure to index cases reducing the chance of transmission from

322

elsewhere. Samples were available from index cases a median of four days after symptom onset and the

323

initial sample in contacts was taken on average 5 days after exposure which may limit our ability to detect

324

associations with peak viral load. Despite this we still demonstrate clear dose effects in relation to both

325

risk of transmission and time to symptom onset. Finally, our study population is reflective of the trial

326

from which the study sample is drawn and is therefore biased towards female participants, few

327

comorbidities and predominantly mild-moderate infection and further data is needed on the risk of

328

transmission in other populations.

329

In summary, our results provide evidence regarding the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission,

330

particularly on the role of the viral load. The higher risk of transmission among individuals with higher

331

viral loads adds to current evidence and encourages assessing viral load in cases with a larger number of

332

close contacts. When a case with high viral load is identified, implementation of reinforced contact

333

tracing measures and quarantines, may be critical to reduce onward transmission. Similarly, our results

334

regarding the risk and expected time to developing symptomatic Covid-19 encourage risk stratification of

335

newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections based on the initial viral load.
