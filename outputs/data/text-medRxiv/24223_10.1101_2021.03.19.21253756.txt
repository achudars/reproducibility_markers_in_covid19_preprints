Structured Abstract
Importance: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) is emerging as a major public
health issue.
Objective: We characterized the incidence of PASC, or related symptoms and diagnoses, for
COVID-19 and influenza patients.
Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Our data sources were the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE),
Optum Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)
databases that were transformed to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP)
Common Data Model (CDM) and were part of the Observational Health Sciences and
Informatics (OHDSI) network.
Participants: The COVID-19 cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or
positive lab test of SARS-CoV-2 after January 1st 2020 with a follow up period of at least 30
days. The influenza cohort consisted of patients with a diagnosis of influenza between October
1, 2018 and May 1, 2019 with a follow up period of at least 30 days.
Intervention: Infection with COVID-19 or influenza.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), or related
diagnoses, for COVID-19 and influenza patients.
Results: In aggregate, we characterized the post-acute experience for over 440,000 patients
who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for SARS-COV-2. The long term sequelae
that had a higher incidence in the COVID-19 compared to Influenza cohorts were altered smell
or taste, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea and alopecia. Additionally, the long term
incidences of respiratory illness, musculoskeletal disease, and psychiatric disorders for the
COVID-19 population were higher than expected.
Conclusions and Relevance: The long term sequelae of COVID-19 and influenza may be
different. Further characterization of PASC on large scale observational healthcare databases is
warranted.

Background
The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact of COVID-19 disease has
resulted in major morbidity and mortality worldwide. While substantial research has sought to
characterize the disease natural history and the acute management of COVID-19, comparatively
fewer studies have focused on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)1-6. Much
of the publicly available data on PASC come from case reports and single-institution prospective
cohort studies7-13. Patient reported symptom data have shown that prolonged fatigue,
headache, dyspnea and anosmia are PASC symptoms14. However, there are fewer claims and
electronic health record (EHR) data about the incidence of PASC symptoms. Therefore, the
public knowledge about PASC symptom presentation is evolving. The National Institutes of
Health has encouraged the study of PASC on large-scale observational databases in order to
better understand the condition and its public health impact15. In alignment with that effort, we
present data on PASC patients from EHR and claims databases with an aim to characterize the
natural history of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who developed symptoms or diagnoses related to
PASC. Additionally, we characterized related long-term sequelae of influenza to provide a
comparison.
Methods
Three observational health databases were used for the analysis: a private-payer
administrative claims database (IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters- CCAE), a
database of inpatient and outpatient electronic health records (OptumÂ© de-identified
Electronic Health Record Dataset- Optum EHR), and an electronic health record system from an
academic medical center (Columbia University Irving Medical Center- CUIMC). All databases
were transformed to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) Common Data
Model (CDM), and described further in Supplementary Appendix#1.
We defined a COVID-19 cohort as patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 or positive lab
test of SARS-CoV-2 after January 1st 2020 with a follow up period of at least 30 days. An
influenza cohort was defined as patients with a diagnosis of influenza between October 1, 2018
and May 1, 2019 with a follow up period of at least 30 days. We performed characterizations of
COVID-19 and influenza patients who had at least one of the following symptoms or diagnoses
that were related to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC), according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)15: altered smell or taste, myocarditis, acute
kidney injury, dyspnea, alopecia, tachycardia, chest pain, lung disorder, myalgias, dementia or
cognitive Impairment, malaise, fatigue, stress disorder, depression, anxiety, joint pain, mood
changes, cough, rash, and fever. We calculated the number of patients who had each and any
of these diagnoses between 30 and 180 days after the index event.
Diagnoses were based on ICD-10-CM and SNOMED codes, while lab tests included
LOINC codes. The full list of codes for the symptoms and diagnoses (Supplementary Appendix
#2) and our calculation of relative risk (Supplementary Appendix#3) are provided in the
supplementary information.

Results
In aggregate, we characterized the post-acute experience for over 440,000 patients who
were diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for SARS-COV-2. We identified 119,510
patients with COVID-19 in the Optum EHR database. Of those, 42,991 (36.28%) had at least one
long term sequela. In the IBM MarketScan CCAE database, we identified a total of 306,142
patients with COVID-19, 74,320 (24.28%) of whom had at least one long term sequela. In the
CUIMC database, 6,198 (27.52%) of 22,524 patients of patients with COVID-19 had a PASCrelated observation within the following 6 months.
Table 1 shows the number of patients from the COVID-19 and influenza cohorts in each
database, and subgroups of patients with all or any PASC diagnoses. Five PASC diagnoses had
higher relative risk in COVID-19 compared to Influenza patients: altered smell or taste,
myocarditis, acute kidney injury, dyspnea and alopecia.
Additionally, the proportions of patients who had post-acute diagnoses or symptoms of
lung disorder, chest pain, depression, anxiety or joint pain in the COVID-19 cohort were greater
than 2% in each database.

had any or all post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) infection diagnoses between 30 and
180 days after the index event are shown. Those subgroups are ranked in descending order of
relative risk for COVID-19 compared to influenza patients. The red cells show data for the group

Discussion
We have reported one of the largest studies about the incidence of PASC, and related
symptoms or conditions, in a cohort of patients infected with COVID-19 using claims and EHR
data. The incidences of some outcomes were greater for the COVID-19 cohort compared to the
influenza cohort. Therefore, long term sequelae of COVID-19 may be different from influenza.
For example, we expect that the long-term anosmia prevalence will likely be greater for COVID19 patients.
Additionally, we observed symptoms and diagnoses in the COVID-19 cohort at nonnegligible rates. Given the global prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, those conditions could
have a major public health impact. Specifically, the global burden of respiratory illness,
musculoskeletal disease, and psychiatric disorders may increase as a consequence of the
COVID-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that PASC is likely composed as a heterogeneous
constellation of continuing symptoms that do not resolve, rare but unusual symptoms, and
prevalent serious symptoms.
Alternative approaches to characterizing PASC have used self-reported symptom data.
Although those approaches are comprehensive, self-reported data may be different from
patient assessments by healthcare providers. We expect that the differences in these kinds of
data may help explain why the incidences of outcomes in our study are lower than incidences
reported in patient self-assessment studies9,10,13.
A limitation of our analysis is that we did not validate our phenotypes, and therefore
measurement error is possible; however, we used the CDC description for PASC in developing
our phenotype15. Also, patient attrition to primary care sites out of network may have
contributed to bias in the EHR database.
We have demonstrated the feasibility of characterizing the natural history of post-acute
COVID-19 infections on both EHR and claims databases. The implications of our analysis may
lead to public health interventions that can reduce the global burden of long-term sequelae
from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Conclusions
We have presented one of the largest characterizations of post-acute sequelae of SARSCoV-2 (PASC) to date, examining data from multiple disparate populations. Electronic
healthcare record data can be used to characterize PASC; additional replication of our analysis
on other databases could strengthen our findings.
