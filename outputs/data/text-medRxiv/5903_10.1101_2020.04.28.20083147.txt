Abstract
INTRODUCTION The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing event disrupting lives, health systems, and
economies worldwide. Clear data about the pandemic’s impact is lacking, namely regarding mortality. This
work aims to study the impact of COVID-19 through the analysis of all-cause mortality data made available
by different European countries, and to critique their mortality surveillance data. METHODS European
countries that had publicly available data about the number of deaths per day/week were selected (England
and Wales, France, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal). Two different methods were selected to estimate the
excess mortality due to COVID19: (DEV) deviation from the expected value from homologue periods, and
(RSTS) remainder after seasonal time series decomposition. We estimate total, age- and gender-specific excess
mortality. Furthermore, we compare different policy responses to COVID-19. RESULTS Excess mortality
was found in all 5 countries, ranging from 10.6% in Portugal (DEV) to 98.5% in Italy (DEV). Furthermore,
excess mortality is higher than COVID-attributed deaths in all 5 countries. DISCUSSION The impact of
COVID-19 on mortality appears to be larger than officially attributed deaths, in varying degrees in different
countries. Comparisons between countries would be useful, but large disparities in mortality surveillance
data could not be overcome. Unreliable data, and even a lack of cause-specific mortality data undermine the
understanding of the impact of policy choices on both direct and indirect deaths during COVID-19. European
countries should invest more on mortality surveillance systems to improve the publicly available data.

1. Introduction

riod ranges from 4 to 6 days and the mean serial interval ranges from 4 to 8 days [3]. There
is probably an early peak of infectiousness,
with probable presymptomatic transmission
for some cases [4]. Median time from onset of
symptoms to intensive care unit (ICU) admission is around 10 days [5]. WHO reported that
the time between symptom onset and death
ranged from about 2 weeks to 8 weeks [6]. Case
Fatality Rate is estimated to range from 0.87 to
9.36 (updated 21st April) [7].

020 started with news about a strange
pneumonia virus in Wuhan, China. Since
then, it has been declared a Pandemic by
the World Health Organization (WHO), and
it has caused, as of April 19th, 2 281 714 confirmed cases and 159 511 deaths of COVID-19,
of which 1 018 221 cases and 159 511 deaths in
Europe [1].
COVID-19 is a clinical entity caused by a
novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Its epidemiology is still uncertain. Person-to-person spread
of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur mainly via
respiratory droplets [2]. Mean incubation pe-

ity. Some countries only test patients in need of
hospitalization. Others have policies that recommend testing everyone that presents with
a set of symptoms, regardless of their need of
hospital care. However, to our knowledge, no
country has been able to test every patient with
suggestive clinical presentation, due to a global
shortage of tests. Thus, the number of infected
individuals will inevitably be larger than the
number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.
Deaths attributed to COVID-19 are also difficult to measure accurately. Problems with testing affect not only confirmed cases but also attributed deaths. Besides, testing is not enough
to determine the cause of death, as some patients may die while infected with SARS-CoV-2,
but not due to it. Due to constraints health systems are facing across the world, it is likely that
a precise attribution of cause of death is not
possible. Additionally, some patients die without there having been a suspicion of COVID19.
We postulate that mortality surveillance can
be of help in the everyday management of
health systems, but especially during health
crisis such as infectious disease outbreaks
where an estimate of observed excess mortality
could be informative. Compared to the ability to identify, test and attribute deaths to a
novel pathogen, measuring mortality is relatively simple. Furthermore, contrary to novel
pathogens, which may have specificities that
require the collection of unusual data, it benefits from the possibility of having IT systems
in place in advance.
The EuroMOMO network monitors weekly
all-cause age-specific excess mortality in countries in Europe through a standardised approach. At the moment, data is available for up
to the 12th of April (week 15). In week 11, Italy
had high excess mortality, and it has had very
high excess since then. Portugal had “above
expected” mortality in weeks 13 and 14. The
Netherlands faced high mortality in week 12
and very high ever since, and England as well.
For Wales, week 13 had high mortality, and
week 14 very high. Lastly, France had high
mortality in week 12, very high in weeks 13
2

and 14, but no excess this last week. Beyond
this qualitative analysis, we found four studies
of excess mortality during COVID-19. Switzerland has a mortality surveillance system in
place with data from the Federal Statistical Office [8] that estimates 892 excess deaths for
those above-65 up to April 12th. Instituto Carlos III in Spain found a 56,5% all-cause mortality excess from March 17th - April 7th (13
954 excess deaths), mostly in individuals older
than 75 and males [9]. Researchers familiar
with the Spanish mortality surveillance system
mentioned some concerns about data reliability for the last few days, so it’s likely that this
may be revised upwards [10]. Cancelli and
Foresti found increases in overall mortality in
several Italian regions ranging from 4 to 10
times the amount of COVID-19 reported deaths
[11]. They conclude that deaths attributed to
COVID-19 are underestimated, and end their
paper calling for more, better data on the pandemic. Galeotti et al. use a self-titled “rule
of thumb calculation” pointing to a 1:1 to 1:3
COVID-19 to unexplained excess death count,
a number not meant to be interpreted as an
epidemiological model, but only as an insight
into a potentially disregarded information gap
[12]. These last two studies have strong limitations, most of all regarding the estimation
of excess deaths, but it’s reasonable to assume
that their conclusions stand.
Our aim is to quantitatively characterize allcause mortality in selected European countries
in an effort to better measure the impact of
COVID-19, and to critique mortality surveillance data. We also confront mortality data
with policy decisions.

2. Methods
We estimated excess mortality during COVID19 in 5 European countries, using two different methods and comparing it to COVID-19
attributed deaths, and analysed policies undertaken by each country.
DATA SOURCES We searched for daily or
weekly data on all-cause mortality for most
European countries, particularly those partici-

pating in EuroMOMO. We could find suitable
data for Portugal, Italy, France, England and
Wales, and the Netherlands. We define suitable
data as data available for a period matching
the start of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Europe,
publicly available, timely updated, and with
daily or weekly resolution. Datasets are described in Table 1.
We checked every dataset for internal consistency, comparing age and gender-specific totals
and checking for strange values comparing different years/datasets available.
We collected data on COVID deaths from
Johns Hopkins University CSSE Repository
[18], except for England and Wales, where we
used data from ONS [19] to use date of registration, as use for all-cause mortality.
DATA HARMONIZATION Datasets selected for this work are diverse and required
some harmonization work. We can divide them
according to several characteristics. Portugal
and France have daily data, which we have decided to adapt into weekly data to have a common data unit and smoothen daily variations
that may disturb the analysis. Italy, the Netherlands, and England and Wales already have
weekly data. All countries report their weekly
mortality differently, with the Netherlands using Monday as the first day of their week, England and Wales using Saturday, and Italy using
a first, 11-day week, and 7-day weeks for the
rest, regardless of the day of the week (and
with one 8-day week for bissextile years). We
used England and Wales as a template to adapt
Portuguese and French data. Regarding agegroups, all countries report it differently, with
under and over-65 as the only age group with
comparable data. Thus, we created a dataset
with age-specific mortality for under- and over65 for all 5 countries. We have corrected Italian
data for the last week of February, since they
have 8-day weeks every bissextile year. We
have considered only 7/8 of deaths reported
for that week, both for 2016 and 2020. Stratified data from the Netherlands presented an
artifact every year-end, which resulted in some
years ending with 53 weeks (last one incomplete). For these, data from week 53 was ag-

gregated with week 1 (also incomplete) from
the following year. Portugal has no data on
gender mortality. Our datasets are accessible
on GitHub [20].
DATA ANALYSIS We calculated excess
mortality based on two different statistical
methods, which were applied to total all-cause
mortality and to four subtotals: under-65, male
and female, and over-65, male and female. We
started our analysis on the day of the first
COVID-19 death in each country, naming the
first full week after that “week 1”. We calculated the amount of excess deaths that could be
explained by COVID-19, and we also looked at
week-to-week trends in total mortality for each
country, using “week 0” as a baseline to chart
a comparative evolution of weekly mortality
in each country. Deviation from the expected
value from homologue periods (DEV) Mortality is relatively stable across the years for all
analyzed datasets. Thus, we calculate the expected mortality using the homologue mean
for previous years and adding a standard deviation to account for normal variation. This may
lead to an underestimation of excess deaths, as
it sets a high threshold. Other authors use
a higher threshold (3 z-scores for the EuroMOMO algorithm, for instance) but usually
discount previous periods of excess mortality.
For this method, we present the results as
the number of excess deaths for the timespan
beginning with the first full week since the
country’s first death, and consider only weeks
with excess deaths for computing excess deaths
as a percentage of expected deaths.
Remainder after seasonal time series decomposition (RSTS) The second method we used
for estimating excess mortality considers the
series of weekly number of deaths explicitly
as a time series and applies a seasonal decomposition [21] to adjust observed mortality for
seasonality and trend, exposing an irregular
component (remainder) that should be an indication of the excess mortality in that period. It
works by using LOESS [22] polynomial smoothing iteratively on the seasonal sub-series, after which the remainder is smoothed to find
the trend. The remainder component is the

residual from the seasonal plus trend fitted using weighted least squares. Remainders were
found using a yearly seasonality and a 10-years
long trend, using two models for each country: one where only the trend is explicitly included in the regression, and another where
seasonality was also explicitly included in the
regression. R was used to perform the data and
statistical work, including the STL function of
package ‘stats’ (R software, version 3.6.2, R
Foundation for Statistical Computing). Results
for RSTS are presented as an interval (defined
by the result of both models), and the entire
analysed time period is considered for reporting excesses in mortality. Analysis for different
age and gender strata was also performed (if
specific data were available). This method was
not applied to Italy, since its dataset is not a
year-long dataset but contains data just for the
January-April period.
POLICY ANALYSIS We use the Oxford
Covid-19 Government Response Tracker [23]
and its Stringency Index to extract a date for
main policy decisions in all five countries, and
4

compare it to the timeline for all-cause mortality. Like elsewhere in this work, we use the 1st
COVID-19 death as a reference. We chose three
policies as the most relevant: school closure,
cancelling of public events, and domestic travel
restrictions.

3. Results
Data quality Data quality is particularly contrasting among data sources. Internal coherence is lacking in some datasets. For Portugal,
on 6th March 2020 the sum of the district specific mortality for all districts does not equal
the national total for the day, the only such
mistake we were able to find. French data included deaths with no attributed date of death,
which were naturally excluded from the total. These accounted for a total of 204 out of
5,988,702 entries (0.0034%). Italy also reports
very incomplete data: only 1450 of the 7904
Italian counties. England and Wales have missing data on subtotal deaths (unknown age or
gender). We also found poor data structure

for some countries. Italy groups the first 11
days of the year together as a “week”, and uses
the same calendar days for every year, even for
bissextile years. Dutch datasets presented with
ambiguous information regarding weeks at the
end of a year which had less than 7 days: some
years would draw on the truncated weeks for
the previous year and solely update the rest of
the days as their first week death count, and
some others would present a total for a 7 day
period. We did our best to mitigate the impact
of these data quality issues with corrections as
light as possible.
Mortality trends As seen in Figure 1, mortality does not evolve the same way since week
1 of COVID-19 in all countries. For most countries, week 1 is still close to normal, but week
2 starts showing increases in all-cause mortality. Largest week-on-week (WoW) increases
happen on week 2 in Portugal and Italy, week
3 in the Netherlands, and week 4 in England
and Wales. In France, the largest increase in
mortality WoW happens on week 7.
Table 2 presents data on excess deaths with
breakdown by age and gender when possible, alongside the amount of deaths attributed
to COVID-19, according to the DEV method.
We found excess deaths in all studied countries. Italy stands out from the rest for its
large excess mortality, almost doubling the upper limit of expected deaths. The percentage
of excess deaths explained by COVID-19 in
weeks of increased mortality varies substantially, from almost all excess deaths (England
and Wales, 92.9%) to less than half (Netherlands, 46.1%). Age and gender differences were
found, with excess mortality predominantly in
elderly males, and with Portugal and France
showing no excess mortality in under-65 populations.
Table 3 presents data on excess deaths with
breakdown by age and gender according to
the RSTS method. Results are similar to the
DEV method. Excess mortality can be observed
in all 4 countries, ranging from single digit
increases for France and Portugal to double
digit increases in England and Wales and the
Netherlands. As with the DEV method, we

find excess mortality happens mostly in males
over 65. Both France and Portugal present no
excess deaths for under-65.
Looking at Figure 2, we can divide countries
in two groups: those whose mortality is still
growing - France and England and Wales - and
those who are currently experiencing a plateau
or a decrease - Netherlands and Portugal, and
Italy, respectively. Growth happens earlier in
the Netherlands, Italy and Portugal, and later
in England and Wales. Italy is a clear outlier,
with 2 weeks of extreme excess mortality, more
than doubling the baseline of week 0. The country who acted earlier - Portugal - presents the
best results with week 4 showing a downward
trend towards values similar to baseline mortality, and a smaller amount of excess deaths,
both in absolute and relative terms.

4. Discussion
Our main aim was to study all-cause mortality data across different European countries.
Specifically, we aimed to characterize mortality
during COVID-19, including excess mortality,
to compare different policy options and possible impacts on mortality, and to describe and
critique mortality surveillance data.
All 5 studied countries present excess mortality during COVID-19, with large differences
between the one who presents only a slight increase, Portugal, and those with large increases,
such as Italy and England and Wales. Plus,
excess mortality is larger than the amount of
COVID-19 attributed deaths in all 5 countries,
raising questions about the causes of excess
mortality and about the reliability of cause of
death attribution for such a novel and undertested disease. For some countries, it is particularly hard to understand how much of the
excess mortality can be directly attributed to
COVID-19, since deaths occur in large amounts
outside hospitals. COVID-19 deaths happening
in care homes range from 42% in Belgium to
57% in Spain [24]. Besides untested COVID-19caused deaths, which are not quantified, other
deaths may be happening due to the disruption of societies and health systems. Addition5

ally, lower mortality rates during January and
February, mostly due to a warm winter season
in Europe and a light influenza season, may
help explain some of this excess mortality, in
an effect commonly called harvesting.
As would be expected considering data from
COVID-19 deaths, the largest increase in mortality is felt in the elderly. Men over 65 are the
most affected population group, with around
twice the increase in deaths compared to that
of women over 65. This may reflect a higher
6

degree of frailty in elderly men, compared to
elderly women, when exposed to the direct
and indirect effects of the pandemic.
Indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
are felt due to, among others causes, a shift
in healthcare resources and fund allocation towards pandemic containment. Acute care patients may also be less likely to go to an A&E
service, fearing a higher risk of contagion. This
would be confirmed by data from A&E. Poor
strata of society may see communitarian help

they rely on severely hampered. Conversely,
some other changes due to COVID-19 reaction
by the authorities may result in saved lives:
traffic reduction decreases the chances of fatal
road casualties; social distancing measures will
lower the number of risky outdoors activities; a
reduction of working hours leads to a decrease
in chances of job accidents; and increased hand
and respiratory hygiene decreases the rate of
other infections, including influenza and other
respiratory tract infections.
We compare our method with EuroMOMO
for previous periods of the year to check our
threshold against theirs, as EuroMOMO is a
well-calibrated international tool [25]. EuroMOMO alerts for excess mortality in 2020 in
Portugal (above normal (AN) in week 1 and
2, and high excess (HE) mortality in week 3),
in England and Wales (AN in week 1), in the
Netherlands (AN in week 2) and in Italy (AN
in week 3). Our DEV method returns no excess mortality for any of these weeks. Our
RSTS method reports increased mortality for

week 3 in England and Wales, but no further
periods of excess mortality. We find this to be
sufficiently coherent to state that we have a
higher threshold than EuroMOMO and are not
overestimating excess mortality.
Countries who acted earlier relative to their
first COVID deaths seem to have had better
results for overall mortality. This is the case for
Portugal, which has seen a smaller increase in
overall mortality and a faster return to baseline
mortality. However, poor data quality makes it
difficult to propose any relationship between
policy and mortality. Data for England and
Wales must be interpreted carefully, since it
does not represent date of death, but date of
registration, which can account for such a delayed increase in excess mortality. France provides data with low reliability, as can be confirmed through the extensive delays in the reporting of deaths - the file for March, available
in April, added deaths to January and February, thus making it possible that we’ll have to
wait until June to truly quantify the mortality

i. Relevance of this work
COVID-19 cases and mortality have been heavily scrutinized by public opinion. There has
been great interest in this topic in the media,
with some articles mentioning the unreliability of data thus far [26]. Scientists in some
European countries have asked for access to
better data in order to help fight the pandemic.
This includes efforts to improve open data initiatives [27], [28], but also collaboration between government and academia in topics in
which open data is not possible (detailed clinical records, for instance).
No country has publicly available mortality
surveillance data accurate and detailed enough
to answer important questions during the on8

going pandemic. The one who comes closest
is Portugal, with a shorter delay, and more
coherent and more refined data, but without
detailed gender-specific or regional data and
lacking causes of death. Monitoring excess
mortality and its causes would also allow for a
better balance between avoiding damage from
the pandemic and damage caused by the measures taken to fight the pandemic. Some policymakers worry about the impact of social distancing and lockdown measures, and having
up-to-date mortality data would be a useful
tool to achieve the difficult balance between
fighting an outbreak and avoiding larger than
needed negative impacts for the population.
Despite the existence of regional data in
most surveyed countries, it faces increased data
problems compared to nationwide data. Italy
has timely available data for less than half its
regions; Portugal is only updating its “Districts”, which do not geographically match the
health regional administrations that are respon-

Figure 2: All-cause mortality trends, week 0 as baseline for all selected countries. Week 0 is the week before the 1st full
week after the first COVID-19 death in each country

sible for COVID-19 data reporting. England
and Wales, the Netherlands and France have
detailed regional data, but it suffers from the
same constraints as country data.
Appropriate EU-level guidance on mortality
surveillance and reporting would solve many
of the problems we identify. Recently, the EU
Commission has adopted a toolbox for coordination on mobile contact tracing apps [29].
Despite this being an important step, we find
it more useful to have coordinated COVID19 case and death reporting, as well as allcause mortality data. Without accurate, panEuropean, data, it is difficult to compare different policy strategies and prioritize resources
for most-affected regions. This is particularly
important considering the wide variety of policy responses during this crisis, which will be
difficult to study without comparable, reliable,
transparent data.
This study has several limitations related to
the quality of data or methods that are important to mention. As previously stated, data has

many problems and this greatly limits its interpretations. For this reason, limitations cannot
be overcome, and thus we chose to be conservative in estimating excess mortality, as one can
confirm when comparing our results to other
results, such as those mentioned in this paper.
Regarding future work, we aim to include a
regional analysis of each country and to add
other countries. Data on causes of death would
also help us understand collateral damages
from the pandemic. Lastly, collecting data on
hospital usage, especially A&E services, would
provide good clues to whether excess deaths
from non-COVID-19 causes could be avoided
by strengthening other health services.

ii. Main findings and recommendations
An excess of mortality was found in all studied
countries in the period after the first COVID-19
attributed death, beyond those deaths directly
confirmed as COVID-19. However, mortality

surveillance systems in the five studied countries presented several data quality issues that
hindered a more in-depth analysis, relevant
both for pandemic and normal contexts. Therefore, as members of the international community of researchers that seek to work on European COVID-19 issues, the following recommendations are highly suggested:
1. Very few European countries have up-todate, publicly available, mortality data.
Each European country should have a public mortality surveillance site (Portuguese
site EVM is a good template)
2. Some countries take weeks to publish their
mortality data, making it difficult to follow the evolution and analyse data in time
to help decisions. The delay to make public data available should be the minimum
possible (< 5 days)
3. Each country uses a different rule to group
data into time periods (deaths per day; per
week, starting in different weekdays, and
with weeks having more than seven days
in one country). Share data on daily number of deaths (not just grouped in weeks)
4. Relevant hypotheses are very difficult to
test due to a lack of data, namely regarding causes of excess mortality. Add causes
of death, using an international terminology standard, to the reports
5. Gross errors can be found in available
data Improve internal automatic verifica10

tion methods to detect and correct data
problems before publishing data.
