Abstract

17

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid, cost effective and

18

easy-to-use diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen detection (RAD) for use in point of

19

care settings or as self-tests, to limit disease transmission. Using saliva samples would further

20

greatly facilitate sample collection, diagnostic feasibility, and mass screening.

21

Objective: We tested two rapid antigen immunochromatographic tests designed for detection

22

of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva: Rapid Response™ COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette for oral fluids

23

(Rapid Response) and DIAGNOS™ COVID-19 Antigen Saliva Test (DIAGNOS). Evaluation of

24

detection limit was performed with purified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and titrated live

25

SARS-CoV-2 virus and compared to Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Panbio) designed

26

for nasopharyngeal samples. Sensitivity and specificity were further evaluated on RT-qPCR

27

positive and negative saliva samples from individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 (n=34); and

28

asymptomatic health care personnel (n=20).

29

Results: The limit of detection of the saliva test from DIAGNOS was comparable with the

30

Panbio test and showed higher sensitivity than Rapid Response for both nucleocapsid protein

31

and diluted live viruses. DIAGNOS and Rapid Response further detected seven (47%) and five

32

(33%), respectively, of the 15 RT-qPCR positive saliva samples in individuals hospitalized with

33

COVID-19. Of the 39 RT-qPCR negative samples, all were negative with both tests (specificity

34

100%; 95% c.i. 0.91-1.00). Only one of the RT-qPCR positive saliva samples (Ct 21.6) contained

35

infectious virus as determined by cell culture and was also positive using the saliva RADs.

36

Conclusion: The results show that the DIAGNOS test exhibit a similar limit of detection as the

37

Panbio RAD and may be an important and easy-to-use saliva RAD complement to detect

38

infectious individuals.

Introduction

40

There is an urgent need for rapid and easy to use diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 to limit disease

41

transmission during the ongoing pandemic. The diagnostic gold standard, reverse

42

transcription real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) have a high specificity and sensitivity, but have

43

limitations with regards to time, cost, and logistics (1, 2).

44

To overcome these issues several rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADs) have rapidly been

45

developed for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. There are now a multitude of such RADs available (3).

46

At least a few have demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in comparison to RT-qPCR

47

(3-6). Moreover, previous studies have shown that RADs can exhibit high sensitivity in

48

detecting samples containing infectious virus, indicating a high sensitivity to detect contagious

49

individuals (7, 8). The vast majority of RADs today are designed for nasopharyngeal samples

50

(3-6). Using saliva instead of nasopharyngeal swabs has several advantages. It is a noninvasive

51

technique, easy to self-collect with little discomfort, does not require specialized health care

52

personnel and thus reduced risk for the user (9). Today, there are few RADs designed for saliva

53

available that have been thoroughly validated.

54

In this study, we have evaluated saliva RADs from two suppliers: Rapid Response™ COVID-19

55

Antigen Rapid Test Cassette for oral fluids (Rapid Response) and DIAGNOS™ COVID-19 Antigen

56

Saliva Test (DIAGNOS). Both RADs are immunochromatographic assays detecting the SARS-

57

CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in saliva without any specialized instruments. The tests were first

58

evaluated using SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and live SARS-CoV-2 virus titrated in saliva

59

or test kit buffer and compared to Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Panbio) designed

60

for nasopharyngeal samples. Finally, the tests were evaluated on saliva samples from

61

individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 and asymptomatic health care personnel and

compared to RT-qPCR. We further correlated the sensitivity of the RADs with regards RT-qPCR

63

Ct-values and infectivity in cell culture.

Material and Methods

65
66

Clinical samples and rapid antigen saliva tests

67

Saliva samples were obtained from COVID-19 hospitalized individuals in the COVID-19 cohort

68

of Vrinnevi hospital, Norrköping, Sweden. Saliva samples were taken by a nurse and after

69

being transported to the laboratory the same day, aliquoted and stored at -80°C until analysis.

70

In total 34 saliva samples were used in this study, collected five to 30 days post symptom

71

onset. Saliva samples from asymptomatic healthcare workers (n=20) were also analyzed.

72

The two antigen saliva tests used in the study were Rapid Response™ COVID-19 Antigen Rapid

73

Test Cassette for oral fluids (BTNX, Markham, Canada) and DIAGNOS™ COVID-19 Antigen

74

Saliva Test kit (Nantong Diagnos Biotechnology, Rugao, China).

75
76

Sensitivity testing with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein

77

To test the sensitivity and detection limit of the nucleocapsid protein (NCp), purified NCp

78

(Nordic Biosite, Sweden, Code: OOEF01087) at a concentration ranging between 500 ng to

79

5 pg, with 10-fold dilutions was tested with both kits. Each kit buffer was used for making the

80

dilution series. One drop of kit buffer was added, followed by 50 µL of sample containing the

81

protein and two more drops of buffer. Both kits were tested at the same time to make it

82

possible to directly compare the readings. After 15 minutes of incubation, two persons,

83

independently of each other, made the readings which were documented.

84
85

Sensitivity of rapid antigen tests using saliva diluted SARS-CoV-2 virus

86

Saliva negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used to make dilutions of cell cultured infectious SARS-

87

CoV-2. A 10-fold dilution series starting from 1:10 to 1:1.000.000, were prepared and used to

test both RADs according to the respective manufacturers´ instructions. The same saliva

89

without virus addition was used as negative control.

90
91

Evaluation on saliva collected from patients hospitalized with COVID-19

92

Samples were tested simultaneously with both antigen tests to enable a direct comparison.

93

According to instructions, 30 µl of saliva + 70 µl of kit buffer were mixed for the Rapid

94

Response™ COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette, and 40 µl of saliva + 35 µl of kit buffer for

95

DIAGNOS™ COVID-19 Antigen Saliva Test kit. The prepared sample was added to each test

96

stick in the given volume (100 L and 75 L, respectively), at room temperature, according to

97

the manufacturer’s instructions. After 15 minutes of incubation, two persons, independently

98

of each other, read all test sticks to determine positivity or negativity. Positivity was further

99

categorized into three strengths: “+++” where the intensity of the test band was stronger than

100

the control band, “++” where the test band intensity was similar to the control band and “+”

101

where the test band intensity was weaker. There was no difference in observations made by

102

the two persons. Photos were taken for documentation.

103
104

Cell culture to detect infectious virus in saliva

105

All SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive saliva samples were cultured on Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were

106

cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf

107

serum (FCS) and gentamycin. Cells were seeded as monolayer in 48-well plates and at time of

108

confluency they were infected with the saliva sample in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory,

109

essentially as described (7). Before infection the cells were washed two times with DMEM

110

supplemented with 2% FCS and gentamycin. 20 L of saliva samples were diluted (DMEM

111

supplemented with 2% FCS and gentamycin) to a total volume of 350 L in a 48 well with cells.

112

Samples were blind passaged two times on Vero E6 cells for 3 days each. All cultured saliva

113

samples were tested after passage two for presence of SARS-CoV-2 using the Panbio antigen

114

test and RT-qPCR, to investigate virus replication.

RNA extraction and in-house RT-qPCR for envelope and RdRp genes

117

Viral RNA was extracted using QIAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to

118

manufactures instructions with the exception that 10 times less sample volume was used, due

119

to need of saliva for both the two RADs as well as cell culture. RNA from the COVID-19 cohort

120

saliva samples (n=54), saliva containing titration of SARS-CoV-2 virus and cultured saliva

121

samples on Vero E6 cells were analyzed using a qPCR for the envelope and RdRp genes. The

122

primers and probes for the envelope gene were E_Sarbeco_P1, E_Sarbeco_F and E_Sarbeco_R

123

from (10). The primers for RdRp were RdRpF: 5’- GTC ATG TGT GGC GGT TCA CT- ‘3 and RdRpR

124

5’-AAA CAC TAT TAG CAT AAG CAG TTG-’3 , modified from (11), and probe RdRp_Pi 5’ AGG

125

TGG AAC CTC ATC AGG AGA TGC ‘3 from (11). RT-qPCR was performed on CFX96 (Biorad) using

126

iTaq Universal Probes Supermix (Biorad) with following cycling conditions: reverse

127

transcription at 46°C for 30 min; followed by initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed

128

by 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 seconds and 56°C for 1 minute (RdRp primers) or 58°C for 30 seconds

129

(envelope primers). All samples were run in duplicates. A sample was considered positive if

130

any of the two RT-qPCR assays were positive. Saliva samples from asymptomatic healthcare

131

workers were only analyzed for the RdRp gene.

132
133

Results and discussion

137

In this study we have evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 RADs designed for use in saliva samples,

138

enabling noninvasive, easy sampling. Firstly, we investigated the detection limit of the assays

139

comparing to Panbio, a widely used RAD for nasopharyngeal samples, using the SARS-CoV-2

140

NCp protein in a range concentration from 500 ng to 5 pg. The Rapid Response test detected

141

50 pg, and the DIAGNOS test as well as the Panbio detected 5 pg. These detection limits are

142

in the range of conventional ELISAs (12), which is a standard method of protein detection. We

143

subsequently performed two different sets of virus detection tests, using dilution series of

144

laboratory cultivated SARS-CoV-2 diluted in i) saliva samples, or in ii) test kit buffer, the latter

145

enabling a direct comparison with the Panbio RAD. The DIAGNOS and Rapid Response

146

detected the same virus amount as the Panbio using SARS-CoV-2 diluted in test kit buffer (data

147

not shown), whereas the DIAGNOS test exhibited a lower detection limit for virus diluted in

148

saliva compared to the Rapid Response test (Figure 1).

149
150

We subsequently tested the saliva samples collected from patients hospitalized for COVID-19

151

using the RADs (Table 1). The saliva was collected at various time points post symptom onset,

152

with a median of 10.5 days (range 5-30 days). 15 saliva samples were RT-qPCR positive, and

153

19 saliva samples were RT-qPCR negative. 13 of the 15 RT-qPCR positive saliva were positive

154

with both envelope and RdRp gene assays, whereas two were only positive with the RdRp

155

assay (Figure 1). In addition to saliva samples of hospitalized patients, saliva samples from

156

asymptomatic health care workers were also included (n=20), all of which were negative by

157

RT-qPCR.

158

In total, all RT-qPCR negative saliva samples (n=39), 20 samples from the health care workers

159

and 19 from patients hospitalized with COVID-19, were negative with both tests (specificity

160

100%; 95% c.i. 0.91-1.00).

161

Of the 15 RT-qPCR positive samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, seven (47%) were

162

positive with the DIAGNOS test and five (33%) with Rapid Response test (Figure 1). As

163

expected, subgroup analysis showed an association between lower Ct-values and RAD

164

positivity (Figure 1). We then proceeded to assess the correlation between infectivity and RT-

165

qPCR results. Only one of the 15 PCR positive (6.7%) saliva samples showed SARS-CoV-2

166

replication and associated CPE in Vero E6 cells. This sample contained the highest viral load

167

(Ct 21.6) of all the saliva samples in the study. This saliva sample, collected 6 days after onset

168

of symptoms, was positive with both RADs. Although the numbers are limited, these findings

169

are of interest as they indicate that the saliva RADs can have high sensitivity for detecting

170

contagious individuals, as previously reported for nasopharyngeal RADs (7, 8, 13). To note,

171

one sample with a Ct of 21.9 collected at day 5 post symptom onset, did not show replication

172

or associated CPE in cell culture. Sample infectivity, as determined by cell culturing, may not

173

ultimately define whether a person is infectious or not, but detection of infectious virus in cell

174

culture can be a more reliable method than PCR, since PCR does not provide information

175

about virus viability (14, 15).

176
177

Several studies have evaluated the use of saliva instead of nasopharyngeal swabs as a clinical

178

specimen for COVID-19 diagnostics. Most studies detecting viral RNA in saliva have been

179

evaluated in symptomatic or hospitalized patients, although a few studies screening saliva in

180

asymptomatic individuals exist as well. The results are heterogenous, with saliva showing

181

lower diagnostic accuracy in some studies, while higher in others (9, 13, 16-18);. with one

182

study reporting a higher concordance to nasopharyngeal samples early after symptom onset

183

(18). In this study, no major differences were observed between RT-qPCR positivity with

184

regards to days post symptom onset, with positive saliva having a median of 10 and a negative

185

saliva a median of 11 days (Table 1). The evaluated saliva RADs, however, were more likely to

186

yield a positive result if the saliva sample was collected early during the infection (median 6

187

days) (Table 1). Of the RT-qPCR positive saliva samples collected within a week of symptom

188

onset (n=7), five (71%) and four (57%) were positive with DIAGNOS and Rapid Response,

189

respectively. This was also associated with viral load, with RT-qPCR positive saliva samples

190

collected within one week having a median Ct-value of 25.7 (n=7) compared to a Ct-value of

191

31.5 for RT-qPCR samples collected after one week (n=8). Nevertheless, it is important to

192

consider that onset of symptoms is based on self-reporting and may not be specifically

193

accurate to COVID-19 onset.

194

This study has other limitations. One major limitation is that no saliva samples were available

195

from onset of symptoms as i) saliva are not routinely used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and ii)

196

patient recruited in the COVID-19 cohort had been ill for several days before seeking hospital

197

care. Samples were taken in a range of 5-30 days, with a median of 10.5 DPS and thus do not

198

reflect the intended purpose of the RADs, i.e., early after onset of symptoms. Moreover, as

199

we had limited amount of saliva for both the two RADs as well as for the RT-qPCR and cell

200

culture, we had to use less saliva for RNA extraction than is recommended by instructions of

201

the QIAGEN viral extraction kit, thus likely lowering the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR and

202

overestimating the Ct-values. Finally, a relatively low amount of saliva samples was analyzed,

203

thus warranting careful interpretation of the results.

205

To conclude, using SARS-CoV-2 NCp protein and titrated live SARS-CoV-2, our results show

206

that the rapid saliva antigen test DIAGNOS had similar limit of detection as Panbio, a widely

207

used RAD developed for nasopharyngeal samples. DIAGNOS further exhibited a 47%

208

sensitivity on RT-qPCR positive saliva from COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Sensitivity was

209

however higher on samples collected early after symptom onset, more in line with the

210

intended use of the RADs, corresponding also to a higher viral load. The Rapid Response test

211

showed a higher limit of detection as well as lower sensitivity of RT-qPCR positive saliva

212

samples in hospitalized patients compared to DIAGNOS. The overall results suggest that the

213

DIAGNOS saliva antigen test may be a good and easy-to-use complement and possible self-

214

test to be applied for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Figure 1. Scatter dot blot indicating positivity (green dot) and negativity (red dot) of the rapid
saliva antigen tests in association to RT-qPCR Ct-values for the envelope gene. Two saliva
samples were positive only for the RdRp gene (triangle) and are marked with corresponding
RdRp Ct values. DIAGNOS™ detected seven and Rapid Response™ five of the 15 RT-qPCR
positive samples in the COVID-19 cohort (left panel). Using live SARS-CoV-2 titrated in 10-fold
dilutions of saliva (right panel), DIAGNOS test exhibited higher sensitivity compared to the
Rapid Response test. Green/red dot indicate weak positivity (+/-).
