Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality is associated with hypoxaemia, multiorgan

failure, and thromboinflammation. However severity of disease varies considerably and understanding
physiological changes that may link to poor outcomes is important. Although increased serum ferritin
has been observed in COVID-19 patients consistent with inflammation, other iron parameters have
not been examined to our knowledge. Because iron is required for immunity and oxygen utilisation,
and dysregulated iron homeostasis has been observed in COPD, we investigated serum iron
concentrations in 30 patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission. All patients had low serum iron
but patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure had more profound hypoferraemia. The area
under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to identify severe
hypoxemia was 0·95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and non-severe
hypoxemia was a serum iron concentration of 2·9 µmol/L. By linear regression, serum iron was
associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2. In conclusion, profound hypoferraemia identifies
COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia. Serum iron is a simple biomarker that could be usefully
employed to stratify patients and monitor disease. Severe hypoferraemia may plausibly impair critical
iron-dependent processes such as lymphocyte responses and hypoxia sensing, contributing to
pathology, and is potentially treatable.

COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic on
March 11, 2020, with the major causes of mortality being progressive hypoxia or multiorgan
dysfunction1. Previous work has identified risk factors associated with respiratory failure in patients
with COVID-19 which include older age, neutrophilia, elevated inflammatory and coagulation markers,
and hyperferritinaemia2. Inflammation in general is often accompanied by systemic hypoferraemia3,
and systemic hypoferraemia disturbs normal human responses to hypoxia-induced induced lung
injury4, which is of considerable concern in patients with COVID-19. However, although ferritin
concentrations in COVID-19 are well reported, there are no published data on other markers of iron
status. Therefore, we sought to characterise iron parameters, including serum iron, in COVID-19
intensive care unit (ICU) patients and relate these to disease severity.

We retrospectively evaluated any serum iron profiles that were measured in critically ill patients with
COVID-19 within 24 hours of admission to the ICU, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK between March
31, 2020 and April 25, 2020. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were extracted from routinely
collected healthcare records. We stratified patients according to severity of hypoxaemic respiratory
failure on admission to ICU – severe (PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100 mmHg) versus non-severe (PaO2/FiO2 ratio
100-300 mmHg) 5. Research ethics committee approval was not required for this study as per the UK
Health Research Authority Decision tool (http://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/research/); the local
institutional board (Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Research and Development)
approved ethical oversight and waiver of consent. No direct patient identifiable data were collected.

A total of 30 patients were included and their demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics are
shown in Supplementary Table 1. Overall, 17 (57%) patients were male. The median age was 57 years
(IQR, 52-64). Compared with patients with non-severe hypoxaemia, patients with severe hypoxaemia
had significantly lower levels of serum iron (median 2·3 (IQR, 2·2-2·5) vs 4·3 (IQR, 3·3-5·2) µmol/L, p <
0·001) and lymphocyte counts (mean (SD) 0·50 (0·2) vs. 0·87 (0·4), p = 0·015). There were no

statistically significant differences in transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels between groups
(Figure 1A). The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to
identify severe hypoxaemia was 0·95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and
non-severe hypoxaemia was a serum iron concentration of 2·9 µmol/L (Figure 1B). By linear
regression, serum iron was associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2 (Figures 1C and 1D).

Our findings demonstrate profound hypoferraemia in COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia.
Serum iron was lower when compared with other cohorts of non-COVID-19 ICU patients reported
previously, including those with sepsis 6. Altered iron fluxes have been linked with ICU outcomes
previously, and our data indicate that severe hypoferraemia may be detrimental in COVID-19.6, 7 The
association of serum iron with lymphocyte counts could reflect the requirement of the adaptive
immune response for iron8 and may be relevant for immune competence in COVID-19.

The cause of hypoferremia is likely to be due to increased hepcidin secondary to inflammation 3.
Unlike hepcidin, serum iron is measured widely and so could assist with identification and monitoring
of severity of disease. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as Tocilizumab may increase serum iron by
suppressing hepcidin synthesis, through inhibition of interleukin-6 (which stimulates hepcidin)9. In
summary, a pathological role of severe hypoferraemia in COVID-19 is plausible, for example via effects
on hypoxia sensing and immunity, and potentially treatable, via hepcidin inhibition.
