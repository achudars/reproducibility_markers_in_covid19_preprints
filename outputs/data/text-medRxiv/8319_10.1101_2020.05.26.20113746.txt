Abstract
The current COVID-19 pandemic led to the rapid overload of Intensive Care Units
(ICUs) in countries where the outbreaks was not quickly controlled.
The containment measures put in place to control the outbreaks had a huge
social and economic impacts, and countries are looking for strategies to relax these
measures while maintaining the R0 close or below 1, in an attempt to safely reach
herd immunity.
In this paper we analyse the feasibility of reaching herd immunity without saturating ICUs across countries. We provide an online tool, available at www.aboutthe-curve.net that simulates the time required for such a scenario with a SIR
model. For United States, we find that a minimum of 5 months would be required,
22 months for UK, 1 year for Italy and 9 months for Belgium.
Disclaimer
The presented results are preliminary and have not been peer-reviewed.

A key aspect of the current COVID-19 pandemic has been the rapid overload of
Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in countries and regions where the epidemic was not
quickly controlled [1, 2] because many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and need respiratory support [1].
While mortality currently appears significant in high-risk groups, it seems fairly
low outside those groups [3], with a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) higher for patients
> 60 yrs old and with comorbidities, such as hypertension (odds ratio 2.36 (95% CI:
1.46 to 3.83)), respiratory disease (2.46 (1.76 to 3.44)), and cardiovascular disease
(3.42 (1.88 to 6.22)) [4, 3].

The relatively low mortality outside the high-risk group, the absence of a vaccine
and of an antiviral treatment, and the huge socioeconomic impact of the pandemic
(which will itself cause significant mortality, morbidity, psychological distress, and
economic suffering) suggest that strategies aiming at achieving herd immunity, even
at the cost of substantial mortality, could be evaluated. Once herd immunity has
been achieved, high-risk individuals are protected. By contrast, strategies based
on containment are inherently fragile as temporary failure to maintain the effective
reproduction number R below 1 leads to the flare-up of the disease.
The outbreaks in several major cities or regions (Wuhan, Lombardy, New York,
France’s Grand Est region, etc. ) have shown that letting the disease run its course,
even for a few weeks, leads to the rapid oversaturation of ICUs [5]. As a result, many
countries, regions, and cities have had to resort to draconian lockdown measures,
which have brought outbreaks under control after about 3 weeks with a plateau
in hospitalizations followed by a later decrease. However, such a drop only results
from the severe lockdown measures with harsh social and economic consequences.
The complete lifting of those lockdown measures without appropriate alternative
measures would automatically lead to a dramatic rebound of the epidemic. As such,
locations currently under lockdown are partly cornered by this choice as they search
for strategies to prevent a rebound when they lift lockdown.
In the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model [6], herd immunity is achieved
when a fraction (1 − 1/R0 ) of the population is immune against the disease and the
height of the epidemic peak is given by (1 − 1/R0 − ln(R0 )/R0 ) in an immunologically naive population (no individual immune at the start of the epidemic). For
example, for R0 = 2.2 [7], herd immunity would be achieved if 55% of the population is immune, and 19% of the population would be infectious at the epidemic
peak. Although it is still unclear which fraction of the population requires ICU care
following SARS-CoV-2 infection, the figure of 2% can be used as an estimate [5, 8]
for populations with a constrictive (“older”) age pyramid (current reports of 5%
are for laboratory confirmed cases, which is likely to miss mild and asymptomatic
cases). If correct, this would imply that 4 in 1,000 people would require ICU care
at the epidemic peak, while preexisting ICU bed capacity in high-income countries
[9] ranges from 4.2 per 100,000 inhabitants (Portugal) to 34.7 per 100,000 (United
States). (Note that Turkey’s ICU bed capacity is 46 per 100,000.) Even if the SIR
model only gives a crude estimate, it clearly shows that baseline ICU capacity and
possible peak need are simply on different scales.
So, to avoid oversaturation of ICU capacity, one could imagine pushing down the
effective reproduction number R. In fact, an R that does not lead to oversaturation

of ICU capacity would have to be very close to 1. Under the SIR model, an ICU bed
capacity of 10 per 100,000 inhabitants and 2% of infected individuals requiring ICU
care, R would have to be around 1.1. A more practical setup would be bringing the
ICU load to a fixed capacity that the local healthcare system can handle over the longterm by and then “work through the population” until herd immunity is achieved.
This is essentially the position currently defended by some countries (Netherlands
[10], Sweden[11]): avoid overburdening the ICU, but let the disease move forward in
a controlled manner to build the immunity of the population and eventually achieve
herd immunity. Note that this would require that R equal 1 on average.
Such an approach would however raise two important questions. First, how much
time would be required to achieve herd immunity? Second, how do you control the
number of (ICU) cases at a fixed level. We tackle here the first question by providing
an online app (www.about-the-curve.net) that allows running different scenarios
and estimating the period needed to achieve herd immunity. Concerning the period
of time needed to achieve herd immunity, two important remarks need to be made.
First, if this period is longer than the time needed to develop a vaccine, then the
usefulness of the strategy is questionable. Second, if this period is longer than the
duration of the immunity, part of the individuals who had become immune will
have become susceptible again, so that herd immunity might be completely out of
reach. There is considerable uncertainty about the duration of immunity following
COVID-19 recovery. Immunity has been documented to be around 18 months to 2
years following SARS recovery [12]. This has been considered the default scenario.
However, some coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1) generate little immunity
[13]. There have been several reports of reinfections following COVID-19 recovery
and the issue is still debated [14, 15, 16], since it is unclear whether such reports could
have been the results of false negative diagnostic results [17]. Our web application
allows computing the period for reaching herd immunity taking uncertainty into
account.
To illustrate the model, we can consider a range of scenarios for the United
States (331 million inhabitants) with a baseline ICU capacity of 34.7 beds per 100,000
inhabitants (= 113,000 beds). Assuming R0 between 2 and 3, a COVID ICU capacity
between 15 and 30 beds per 100,000 inhabitants (or between 49,000 and 98,000 beds),
an average ICU stay duration between 10 and 15 days, and a percentage of ICU
admission following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population between 0.7%
and 1.5%, we obtain a time to herd immunity ranging between 5 and 18 months.
Assuming a fatality rate among ICU patients ranging between 33% and 50%, we
obtain a number of COVID fatalities at ICUs ranging between 497,000 and 1,273,000.
While the time to herd immunity could be acceptable in the best case scenario, it

could be equal to the time necessary to develop a vaccine and/or the average duration
of the immunity in the worst-case scenario. By contrast, taking the case of the United
Kingdom with a baseline capacity of 6.6 beds per 100,000 inhabitants, assuming a
long-term COVID ICU bed capacity between 5 and 10 beds per 100,000 inhabitants,
and keeping all the other parameters the same as for the US scenarios, the range for
the time to immunity would be between 16 and 55 months. Obviously, all parameters
are open for discussion, so that the application does not return one specific prediction,
but rather a range for estimates for a range of scenarios. Note that if the user wishes
to consider a single value for a given parameter, both limits of the range can simply
be set to be equal.
Regarding the second question raised by keeping the ICU load constant, we note
that such strategies would require tightly controlling the effective reproduction number Re (the equivalent of R0 when measures are implemented to control the epidemic,
which may vary over time) on average at 1. Whenever Re is above 1, the epidemic
will flare up, which will quickly overload a healthcare system already at saturation.
Whenever Re is below 1, the disease starts vanishing, thereby extending the time
needed to achieve herd immunity. Given that it is unclear what the precise impact
of any containment measure is on Re , a strategy based on lifting and reimposing
measures to switch between Re slightly below 1 and Re slightly above 1 could be
challenging. Moreover, constantly piloting Re on demand would require frequent
changes of the NPIs imposed on the community, which might be socially infeasible.
If it turned out that the percentage of the population that has recovered from
the disease asymptomatically or with minimal symptoms is significantly larger than
expected, this would bring the percentage C of complications significantly lower
and could significantly decrease the period needed to achieve herd immunity. The
availability of a medical treatment that would greatly decrease the chances of complications among symptomatic patients would have a similar effect. An effective
prophylactic pharmaceutical treatment [18], if only used among high-risk individuals
would also have a similar effect.
Methods
The first parameter is the R0 of COVID-19 in a population without containment
measures. This allows calculating the fraction of the population 1 − 1/R0 needed
to reach herd immunity. Given that R0 is uncertain, the application takes a range
[R0− , R0+ ] as input. This allows calculating a range of herd immunity thresholds
[H − = 1 − 1/R0− ; H + = 1 − 1/R0+ ] (in percent of the population) and considers
these values as an error measurement: H − = H − εH ; H + = H + εH . If some

containment measures (hygienic measures, some level of physical distancing, such as
no handshake) were to be maintained after the immunity building period, the value
of R0 used could be lowered, although it is difficult to quantify the effect of such
measures.
Next to the herd immunity target, we also need the ICU bed capacity in beds
per 100,000 inhabitants. This is not the baseline ICU capacity in the population
considered [9], but the ICU capacity fully dedicated to COVID-19 patients over the
course of multiple months [5]. This figure should take into account (1) the ICU bed
capacity that can be additionally deployed in a given population, (2) that the current
deprioritization of all non-urgent ICU capacity is difficult to maintain in the long
term, and (3) that constantly running ICUs at full capacity would make it extremely
difficult to deal with other mass emergencies (such as natural or industrial disasters).
This ICU bed capacity is input as an error range [B − = B − εB ; B + = B + εB ] (in
beds per 100,000 inhabitants). The next variable is the average duration at ICU
as this determines the average number of daily admissions because the number of
ICU COVID patients needs to stay constant. Because there is a large difference in
+
length of stay for fatalities vs. survivors, we use two ranges: [L−
F = LF − εL,F ; LF =
−
+
LF + εL,F ] (in days for fatalities) and [LS = LS − εL,S ; LS = L + εL,S ] (in days for
survivors). We also then require a range for the ICU fatality rate F (in percent):
[F − = F − εF ; F + = F + εF ]. This allows computing a range for the length of stay
across all ICU patients as [L− = L − εL ; L+ = L + εL ] with L = F.LF + (1 − F ).LS

Next, we need the fraction of the population that will require ICU care following
SARS-CoV-2, which is the most uncertain factor. The fraction of the general population that recovers from SARS-CoV-2 infection asymptomatically or with only mild
symptoms is poorly characterized at this point because testing efforts have focused
on symptomatic cases and/or people who have been in contact with infectious patients. Systematic serological surveys are needed to reduce the uncertainty for this
factor. This fraction is also input as a range [C − = C − εC ; C + = C + εC ] (in percent
of the population).
Strategies that aim at segregating high-risk patients from the rest of the population could use a lower fraction, with the aim at achieving a level of immunity in the
low-risk population sufficient to guarantee herd immunity for the total population.
It is important to note that if the population-wide herd immunity threshold is given

by 1 − 1/R0 , and a proportion P of the population remains segregated, then the
immunization rate that needs to be achieve in the exposed population needs to be
increased to (R0 − 1)/(R0 .(1 − P )).
The average number of days till herd immunity can then be computed as
P =

H.L.C
× 100, 000.

The error range can be calculated using error analysis:
p
εP = P. (εH /H)2 + (εL /L)2 + (εC /C)2 + (εB /B)2
and a range can be returned as [P − = P − εP ; P + = P + εP ].
We can also consider further the number of fatalities among ICU COVID patients
in such a strategy. Ultimately, the percentage of the population that will have been
infected will be in the range [H − ; H + ], the fraction of the population needed to
achieve herd immunity. The range for p
the percentage of fatalities in the population
is then given by D = H.F , εD = D. (εH /H)2 +(εD /D)2 , and the range [D− =
D − εD ; D+ = D + εD ].
