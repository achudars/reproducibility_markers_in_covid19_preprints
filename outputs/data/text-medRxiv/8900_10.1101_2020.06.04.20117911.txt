ABSTRACT

44

Background: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous new serological

45

test systems for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have become available

46

quickly. However, the clinical performance of many of them is still insufficiently

47

described. Therefore we compared three commercial, CE-marked, SARS-CoV-2

48

antibody assays side by side.

49

Methods: We included a total of 1,154 specimens from pre-COVID-19 times and 65

50

samples from COVID-19 patients (≥14 days after symptom onset) to evaluate the test

51

performance of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin.

52

Results: All three assays presented with high specificities: 99.2% (98.6-99.7) for

53

Abbott, 99.7% (99.2-100.0) for Roche, and 98.3% (97.3-98.9) for DiaSorin. In contrast to

54

the manufacturers’ specifications, sensitivities only ranged from 83.1% to 89.2%.

55

Although the three methods were in good agreement (Cohen’s Kappa 0.71-0.87),

56

McNemar’s test revealed significant differences between results obtained from Roche

57

and DiaSorin. However, at low seroprevalences, the minor differences in specificity

58

resulted in profound discrepancies of positive predictability at 1% seroprevalence: 52.3%

59

(36.2-67.9), 77.6% (52.8-91.5), and 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin,

60

respectively.

Conclusion: We find diagnostically relevant differences in specificities for the anti-

63

SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin that have a significant

64

impact on the positive predictability of these tests.

Introduction

67

COVID-19 is a new disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

68

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first described by Chinese scientists in early

69

January 2020 (1). On March 11, the WHO officially declared the novel SARS-CoV-2

70

infections a pandemic, which has now spread rapidly across the entire globe, with

71

almost 6.5 million confirmed cases and over 375,000 confirmed deaths (2). COVID-19 is

72

characterized by a broad spectrum of individual disease courses, ranging from

73

asymptomatic infections to the most severe cases requiring intensive medical care (3).

74

The reliable detection of infected persons and, subsequently, their isolation is essential

75

for the effort to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus quickly and efficiently.

76

Therefore, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is required

77

for direct detection of the pathogen. Unfortunately, RT-PCR testing does not always give

78

a clear answer to whether the SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently present or not (4,5).

79

On the other hand, serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies can be used

80

as an additional diagnostic tool in case of suspected false-negative RT-PCR results (6)

81

or for individual determination of antibody levels. Moreover, cross-sectional serological

82

studies provide essential epidemiological information to allow a correct estimation of the

83

spread of the disease within a population (7,8). The first commercially available

84

serological SARS-CoV-2 tests, mostly standard ELISA tests or lateral flow rapid tests,

85

have not always proved to be sufficiently specific and sensitive (9,10). Recently, the first

86

tests for fully automated large-scale laboratory analyzers have been launched. The

87

present evaluation aims to compare three of these test systems manufactured by Abbott

88

(11), Roche (12), and DiaSorin (13), with particular emphasis on specificity, which is

crucial for an adequate positive predictive value given the current low seroprevalence

90

worldwide.

91

Materials and methods

92

Study design and patient cohorts

93

This nonblinded prospective study aims at a detailed comparison of three automated

94

SARS-CoV-2 detection methods with a particular focus on specificity and positive

95

predictability. A total of 1,154 samples from three cohorts of patients/participants with

96

sampling dates before 01.01.2020 were used to test specificity. The samples derived

97

from three different collections: a cross-section of the Viennese population, LEAD study

98

(14), preselected for samples collected between November and April to enrich seasonal

99

infections (n=494); a collection of healthy voluntary donors (n=302; 269 individuals, 11

100

donors with a 4-fold repetition of the donation within a median period of 4.5 years [3.6-

101

5.5]); a disease-specific collection of samples from patients with rheumatic diseases

102

(n=358).

103

For estimation of test sensitivity, samples of 65 COVID-19 donors/patients with a

104

symptom onset to analysis time of ≥14 days (median time interval of 41 [28-49] days)

105

were evaluated in parallel on all three analysis platforms. For asymptomatic donors

106

(n=6), SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmation to analysis time was used instead. We

107

subjected only a single serum sample per patient to sensitivity analysis to avoid data

108

bias due to uncontrolled multiple measurement points of individual patients.

Supplementary Table 1 gives a comprehensive overview of characteristics and cohort-

110

specific inclusion and exclusion criteria; Supplementary Table 2, 3, and Supplementary

111

Fig. 1 provide additional descriptive statistics on donors/patients included in the cohorts.

112

All included participants gave written informed consent for donating their samples for

113

scientific purposes. From patients, only left-over material from diagnostic procedures

114

was used. The overall evaluation plan conformed with the Declaration of Helsinki as well

115

as with relevant regulatory requirements. It was reviewed and approved by the ethics

116

committee of the Medical University of Vienna (1424/2020).

117

Biomaterials

118

Used serum samples were either left-over materials from diagnostic procedures

119

(Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna) or part of a sample

120

cohort processed and stored by the MedUni Wien Biobank. All pre-analytical processes

121

were carried out according to standard operating procedures in an ISO 9001:2008/2015-

122

certified (MedUni Wien Biobank, Department of Laboratory Medicine) and ISO

123

15189:2012-accredited (Department of Laboratory Medicine) environment. Standard

124

sample protocols were described previously (15).

125

Antibody testing

126

SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were measured according to the manufacturers'

127

instructions on three different automated platforms at the Department of Laboratory

128

Medicine of the Medical University of Vienna.

129

1. IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (SARS-CoV-2 IgG) were quantified

130

employing a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) on the Abbott

131

ARCHITECT® i2000sr platform (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA). For the cut-off of

132

≥1.4 Index (S/C), the manufacturer gives a negative percentage agreement (NPA,

133

corresponding to specificity) of 99.60% (95% CI: 98.98 – 99.89) calculated from samples

134

collected before the COVID-19 outbreak and of 100.00% (95.07 – 100.00) in patients

135

with other respiratory illnesses. Regarding diagnostic sensitivity, 0.00% (0.00 – 60.24)

136

are reported <3 days after symptom onset, 25.00% (3.19 – 65.09) on days 3 – 7,

137

86.36% (65.09 – 97.09) on days 8 – 13, and 100.00% (95.89 – 100.00) from day 14 on

138

(11). According to the manufacturer, the assay is designed for the qualitative detection

139

of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

140

2. The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland)

141

was applied on a Cobas e 801 modular analyzer. It detects total antibodies against the

142

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen in a sandwich electrochemiluminescence assay

143

(ECLIA). For the suggested cut-off of ≥1 COI, the manufacturer reports specificities of

144

99.80% (95% CI: 99.58 – 99.92) for samples derived from diagnostic routine, 99.83%

145

(99.51 – 99.97) for blood donors, and 100% (91.19 – 100) for both a common cold panel

146

and a Coronavirus panel. Sensitivity was estimated as 65.5% (56.1 – 74.1) during days

147

0 – 6 post RT-PCR confirmation, 88.1% (77.1 – 95.1) from day 7 to day 13, and 100%

148

(88.1 – 100%) from day 14 on (12). According to the manufacturer, the system delivers

149

qualitative results, either being reactive or non-reactive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

150

3. The LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test detects IgG-antibodies against the

151

S1/S2 domains of the virus' spike protein in a chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA).

152

The test was applied to a LIAISON® XL Analyzer (DiaSorin S.p.A., Saluggia, Italy). The

153

manufacturer reports a diagnostic specificity of 98.5% (95% CI: 97.5 – 99.2) in blood

154

donors and 98.9% in presumably SARS-CoV-2 negative diagnostic routine samples

155

(94.0 – 99.8). Applying a cut-off >15.0 AU/mL (borderline results 12.0 – 15.0, require a

156

re-test algorithm), the test’s sensitivity is reported time-dependently with 25.0% (14.6 –

157

39.4) ≤5 days after RT-PCR-confirmed diagnosis, 90.4% (79.4 – 95.8) from day 5 to day

158

15, and 97.4% (86.8 – 99.5) after >15 days (13). Samples that repeatedly tested

159

borderline were classified as positive. The manufacturer indicates to provide quantitative

160

measurement results on the system.

161

Statistical analysis

162

Unless stated otherwise, continuous data are given as median (quartile 1 – quartile 3).

163

Categorical data are given as counts and percentages. Diagnostic sensitivity and

164

specificity, as well as positive and negative predictive values, were calculated using

165

MedCalc software 19.2.1 (MedCalc Ltd., Ostend, Belgium). 95% confidence intervals

166

(CI) for sensitivity and specificity were calculated according to Clopper and Pearson

167

("exact" method) with standard logit confidence intervals for the predictive values (16).

168

Receiver-Operating-Characteristic (ROC)-curve analysis was used to evaluate test

169

accuracy and compare the diagnostic performance of the three test systems, according

170

to DeLong et al. (17). Between-test agreements were assessed by interpretation of

171

Cohen's Kappa-statistics, and further evaluated with McNemar's tests. Statistical

172

significance was assumed at p<0.05. Figures were produced with MedCalc software

173

19.2.1 and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).

176

Results

177

Specificity

178

To describe assay specificity, we used a total of 1,154 serum samples collected before

179

SARS-CoV-2 circulated in the population and which are, by definition, negative for

180

SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. The three different specificity cohorts A-C (described

181

in detail in Supplementary Table 1-3 and Supplementary Figure 1) presented with

182

different rates of false-positives (Table 1) - cohort C (cohort of rheumatic diseases)

183

showing the highest reactivities. We found in total 9, 3, and 20 false-positive samples for

184

Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin, leading to an assay specificity of 99.2 (95%CI: 98.6-99.7),

185

99.7% (95%CI: 99.2-100.0), and 98.3% (95%CI: 97.3-98.9) respectively (Figure 1A-C).

186

Median and 90th percentile values of negative samples were 0.025 and 0.115 Index for

187

Abbott, 0.0815 and 0.0927 COI for Roche, and below LOD and 5.52 AU/ml for

188

DiaSorin. False-positive samples yielded median values of 2.21 Index (2.14-2.67) for

189

Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG (cut-off: ≥1.4 Index), 1.65 COI (1.47-1.72) for Roche Elecsys®

190

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (cut-off: ≥1 COI), and 22.4 AU/ml (17.38-57.35) for DiaSorin

191

LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG (negative <12.0 AU/ml, equivocal 12.0 AU/ml <= x

192

<15.0 AU/ml, positive ≥15.0 AU/ml).

193

Sensitivity

194

To estimate assay sensitivity, we used serum samples from 65 donors/patients at later

195

time points following SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least ≥14 days after symptom onset

196

(median interval of 41 [28-49] days). In this late phase, we assumed the majority of

197

donors/patients having reached prominent and constant levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific

198

antibodies. Surprisingly, we could find a relatively high percentage of samples that were

199

testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: Abbott 10, Roche 7, and DiaSorin 11 false-

200

negatives leading to calculated sensitivities of 84.6% (73.6-92.4), 89.2% (79.1-95.6),

201

and 83.1 (71.3-91.2)%, respectively. Five serum samples were consistently tested

202

negative in all three assays despite being derived from individuals tested positive for

203

SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. All seven false-negatives in the Roche test overlapped with

204

false-negatives in the Abbott test (both nucleocapsid-antigen based assays), whereas

205

DiaSorin was negative for an additional six serum samples exclusively (S1/S2-domain

206

antigen-based assay).

207

PPV and NPV

208

Although specificity and sensitivity are essential criteria for assessing the quality of a test

209

procedure, they have little informative value about the probability of a positive/negative

210

test result, indicating the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies without

211

taking prevalence into account. Therefore, a comparative overview for specificity,

212

sensitivity, as well as positive and negative predictive values at 1%, 5%, and 10%

213

SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence is shown in Figures 2A and 2B and summarized

214

in Table 2. While the differences between the test systems for varying seroprevalences

215

do not have a significant impact on NPV (range 98.1%-99.9%), the consequences for

216

PPV are pronounced. At seroprevalence rates of 10%, all three systems show

217

acceptable PPVs of 92.3.%, 97.4%, and 84.2% for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin, but at

218

1% seroprevalence these drop to unsatisfactorily or even unacceptably low values of

219

52.3% (36.2-67.9), 77.6% (52.8-91.5), and 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for Abbott, Roche, and

220

DiaSorin.

221

ROC Curve Analysis

222

As shown in Figure 3A-C, all three ROC curves presented with areas under the curves

223

(AUC) above 0.97 (Abbott: 0.994 [95% CI: 0.987-0.997], Roche: 0.989 [0.981-0.994],

224

DiaSorin: 0.977 [0.967-0.985]). Comparison of ROC-AUCs, according to DeLong et al.,

225

did not reveal significant differences (Differences: Abbott/Roche p=0.487,

226

Abbott/DiaSorin p=0.112, Roche/DiaSorin p=0.395). In the next step, we aimed to

227

assess whether modifying the cut-off values could improve the explanatory power of the

228

ROC-curves.

229

Cut-offs associated with the Youden's index (maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity)

230

of >0.42, >0.355, and >8.76 for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin lowered the PPV

231

considerably, being as low as 26.4 (20.3-33.6), 62.1 (43.9-77.4), and 24.8 (18.9-31.9) at

232

1% seroprevalence for Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin (Supplementary Table 4).

233

Between-test agreement/disagreement

234

Correlation analysis of measurement values between the different platforms showed

235

only moderate to weak concordance. The Pearson correlation coefficient was r=0.66

236

(p<0.001), for both Abbott/DiaSorin (both IgG-assays) and Abbott/Roche (both

237

nucleocapsid-antigen based assays). In contrast, Roche/DiaSorin, with a coefficient of

238

r=0.25 and a hardly reached significance of 0.044, could only show a very weak

239

correlation.

240

Therefore, the test systems' agreements were studied in a pairwise fashion applying

241

inter-rater agreement statistics (Cohen's Kappa). The agreement between Abbott and

242

Roche was very good (0.87 [0.81-0.94]). Agreement between Abbott and DiaSorin, and

243

DiaSorin and Roche was good: 0.71 (0.62-0.80), and 0.76 (0.67-0.84), respectively

244

(Table 3). Despite a good overall inter-rater agreement, significant differences could be

245

shown using McNemar's test for DiaSorin and Roche (Supplementary Table 5).

246

Discussion

247

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first side-by-side comparison of three fully

248

automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests applying more than 1,200 distinct donor/patient

249

samples. We identified significant differences between two of the three systems,

250

especially regarding positive predictability at the expectable low prevalence rates.

251

SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus closely related to the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and

252

MERS. Like SARS-CoV-2, those highly virulent pathogens cause severe respiratory

253

syndromes, often with lethal outcome (18). In contrast, infections with other members of

254

the coronavirus family usually present with mild colds, including 229E, OC43, NL63, and

255

HKU1 (19). Compared to SARS-CoV (which is no longer circulating), cross-reactivity

256

between SARS-CoV-2 and endemic seasonal coronaviruses is low. To date, with few

257

exceptions (24), no accumulation of cross-reactivities between anti-SARS-CoV-2

258

antibodies and seasonal coronavirus antibodies has been found. We have therefore

259

refrained from screening a coronavirus panel for possible cross-reactivity.

260
261

Specificity

262

To best describe the specificity of a serological test, it is essential to have a reliable

263

reference, i.e., to ensure that the samples used are negative for the target analyte. For

264

SARS-CoV-2, this means using serum/plasma samples obtained before the first

265

appearance of the new virus. Therefore, we have compiled large pre-COVID-19 cohorts,

266

which have the following characteristics: A) samples of an age and sex-controlled

267

population-based cohort of more than 11,000 participants (LEAD-Study) (14), randomly

268

chosen from Vienna and surrounding areas (n=494). B) samples of healthy voluntary

269

donors (n=302), which are typically used at our Department for the evaluation of new

270

assays, and C) samples of a disease-specific collection of patients with rheumatic

271

diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematodes (n=358),

272

known to have a high prevalence of autoantibodies and other atypical immune activities,

273

enhancing the potential of interference with serological testing. We found several false-

274

positives in the rheumatological cohort (n=13), and to a lesser extent in the other two

275

cohorts (n=9 in the healthy donor cohort and n=10 in the LEAD study). Notably, an

276

overlap of samples tested false-positive in the different systems did not typically occur,

277

and only one of 32 samples tested positive in more than one assay (Abbott and

278

DiaSorin, one sample from the LEAD study). Since these two test systems use different

279

antigens (nucleocapsid vs. S1/S2 proteins) but the same detection method (IgG), this

280

false-positive reaction is likely associated with interference of the IgG measurement.

281

Calculated specificities are strongly dependent on the spectrum and the size of a

282

selected specificity cohort. If we calculated the specificities of each cohort separately,

283

we would be able to report variable specificities: cohort A (Abbott 99.2%, Roche 100%,

284

DiaSorin 98.8%), cohort B (Abbott 99%, Roche 99.7%, DiaSorin 98.3%), and cohort C

285

(Abbott 99.4%, Roche 99.4%, DiaSorin 97.5%). Roche would range from ideal 100%

286

down to 99.4%, the same level as the best result for Abbott, and DiaSorin would be

287

nearly as good as the worst Abbott specificity or show a 2.5% difference to the best

288

Roche value. This would have an enormous impact on prevalence dependent

289

parameters like PPV. A recent evaluation of the DiaSorin LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2

290

S1/S2 IgG assay with 1,140 pre-COVID-19 samples reported a specificity of 98.5% (20),

291

nearly perfectly matching the specificity of 98.3% we found when calculating the average

292

of all three cohorts. In contrast, another recent study reported a specificity of 100% for

293

DiaSorin. However, the authors used only n=81 samples for specificity testing (21).

294

Similarly, a further evaluation comparing all three SARS-CoV-2 tests by Abbott, Roche,

295

and DiaSorin found quite different specificities, namely 100%, 98%, and 96.9% for

296

Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin, respectively. Again, the specificity cohort was very small

297

(n=100, and n=98 for DiaSorin) (22). This underlines the importance of selecting

298

adequately sized testing cohorts to obtain reliable and comparable results. In summary,

299

the specificities of 99.2%, 99.7%, and 98.3% found in the present study are very close to

300

the values given by the manufacturers of 99.6%, 99.8%, and 98.5% for Abbott, Roche,

301

and Diasorin, which were also established on large collectives.

302

Sensitivity

303

The COVID-19 positive cohort used in this study for the estimation of sensitivities is

304

relatively small (n=65). However, it has three distinctive features:

305

1. each patient/donor is represented in the collective with only one serum sample,

306

avoiding bias of the data by multiple measurements of the same individuals,

307
308
309
310

2. the median time of blood sampling was 41 days after onset of symptoms and thus
in the plateau phase of antibody formation, and
3. 80% of the cohort were non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients (two-thirds of them
with mild symptoms), and only 20% were intensive care patients.

311

As sensitivity within the first 14 days after symptom onset is highly variable for most

312

SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays but becomes better >14 days (23,24), we expected high

313

sensitivities for all tested assays in the plateau phase of antibody formation. Surprisingly

314

we found multiple RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients displaying very low antibody

315

titers that did not surpass the respective assay-specific cut-offs and therefore were

316

considered negative. Five samples were negative in all three assays: all were RT-PCR

317

confirmed cases, 4/5 non hospitalized (42-51 days after symptom onset), two with mild

318

and the other two with moderate symptoms, and symptom duration of <1 week for all.

319

None of these patients had a known immune dysfunction or other severe diseases. One

320

patient was an ICU patient with an underlying hematological disease, and the sample

321

was taken at day 15 after symptom onset. This patient mounted a partial antibody

322

response starting from day 21 after symptom onset becoming positive in the Abbott

323

assay (2.21 Index) and reaching positivity on day 30 also in the DiaSorin assay (29.1

324

AU/ml). At this late point, Abbott measured 4.19 Index, whereas Roche remained (since

325

day 21) at a level around 0.2 COI. This example illustrates that although the vast

326

majority of patients show compatible and plausible results in different test systems,

327

single cases can display a complex picture of time-courses and reactivities in specific

328

assay systems that are still poorly understood. Another interesting observation was that

329

in six patients with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in the Roche

330

and Abbott test, DiaSorin failed to detect antibodies. This observation, combined with

331

the claim that the detection of S1/S2 protein-specific antibodies is equivalent to the

332

detection of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) (20), raises the fundamental question of

333

whether nAbs are detectable in all patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. There is

334

evidence that neither the assumption of equivalence of nAbs and S1/S2 protein-specific

335

antibodies (25) nor the assumption that all COVID-19 patients produce measurable titers

336

of nAbs is universally valid (26). A clear answer to the question of whether antibody

337

measurements against nucleocapsid- or spike protein-associated antigens are more

338

sensitive and specific, and how these behave in relation to nAbs assays (the postulated

339

gold standard in terms of sensitivity and specificity) is not possible based on the data

340

currently available.

341

PPV, NPV, ROC-Analysis, test agreement

342

Specificity and sensitivity alone are not sufficient to judge the performance of a

343

diagnostic test; prevalence-dependent accuracy measures like PPV and NPV are

344

necessary, and especially PPV, in times of low prevalence (27). For most regions

345

affected by the pandemic, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals

346

is unknown but can be estimated to be below 5%. Therefore, for all SARS-CoV-2 EUA

347

approved antibody tests, the FDA compares the performance of the assays based on a

348

5% seroprevalence (28). At this rate, the results presented here show PPV values of

349

85.1% (74.7-91.7), 94.8% (85-98), and 71.6% (61.7-79.8) for Abbott, Roche, and

350

DiaSorin, respectively. The PPV values between Roche and DiaSorin differ so clearly

351

that not even the 95% CI intervals overlap. Therefore, we must assume that these two

352

assays differ significantly from each other in terms of positive predictability. Using these

353

two tests at lower seroprevalences, such as 1%, leads to an even more pronounced

354

difference between Roche and DiaSorin (77.6% vs. 32.6%) and an unacceptable low

355

PPV of 32.6% (23.6-43.1) for DiaSorin.

356

Although the area under the curves (0.994, 0.989, and 0.977 for Abbott, Roche, and

357

DiaSorin) did not differ significantly from each other (sensitivity cohort size was too

358

small), modeling of the cut-offs according to Youden's index revealed interesting

359

insights: only Roche could increase the sensitivity without losing specificity dramatically

360

(Sensitivity: 89.2%  98.5%; Specificity: 99.7%  99.4%; cut-off: >0.355 COI). In

361

contrast, DiaSorin at the suggested cut-off of >8.76 AU/ml (similar to (20)) increased the

362

sensitivity from 83.1% to 90.8% but worsened the specificity from 98.3 to 97.2%. In line

363

with this, despite a good overall agreement between Roche and DiaSorin results

364

(Cohen's Kappa 0.76 [0.67-0.84]), the McNemar's test still showed significant

365

differences, indicating disagreement (in particular in false-positives) more often than

366

expected by chance.

367

The strength of this study is the side by side evaluation of three assays with a large

368

number of negative samples to give reliable and comparable specificity data (no missing

369

data). Limitations are the moderate numbers of positive samples. Moreover, obtained

370

sensitivities cannot easily be compared to other studies because of the unique feature of

371

our COVID-19 cohort, including 80% non-hospitalized patients with mainly mild

372

symptoms. The latter is highly relevant for a potential use of antibody tests to assess

373

seroprevalence in large populations.

374

Conclusion

375

We find diagnostically relevant differences in specificities for the anti-SARS-CoV-2

376

antibody assays by Abbott, Roche, and DiaSorin that have a significant impact on the

377

positive predictability of these tests. We conclude that low seroprevalences require an

378

unusually high specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, which pushes some test

379

systems to their limits earlier than others. Therefore, the choice of the test must depend

380

on the respective seroprevalence, and strategies such as confirmation of possible false-

381

positive test results with additional testing must be considered.
