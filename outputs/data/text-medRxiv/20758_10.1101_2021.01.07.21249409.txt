Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a World Health
Organization designated pandemic that can result in severe symptoms and death that
disproportionately affects older patients or those with comorbidities. Kuwait reported its first
imported cases of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020. Analysis of data from the first three months
of community transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak in Kuwait can provide important
guidance for decision-making when dealing with future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave
management. The analysis of intervention scenarios can help to evaluate the possible impacts of
various outbreak control measures going forward which aim to reduce the effective reproduction
number during the initial outbreak wave. Herein we use a modified susceptible-exposedasymptomatic-infectious-removed (SEAIR) transmission model to estimate the outbreak
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kuwait. We fit case data from the first 96 days in the
model to estimate the basic reproduction number and used Google mobility data to refine
community contact matrices. The SEAIR modelled scenarios allow for the analysis of various
interventions to determine their effectiveness. The model can help inform future pandemic wave
management, not only in Kuwait but for other countries as well.

1. Introduction
The Kuwait Ministry of Health reported the country‚Äôs first four, imported COVID-19 cases on
February 24, 2020. Contact tracing showed all were travel-related cases from Iran. Two of the
cases were asymptomatic when tested (KUNA, 2020). In the initial stages of the domestic
outbreak contact tracing as well as home and institutional quarantine measures were used to limit
viral transmission from travelers entering the country (Al-Shammari et al., 2020). After just three
weeks the confirmed number of cases increased to 112, and after six weeks a total of 556 cases
were identified including the first death from COVID-19 on April 4, 2020 (Virusncov.com,
2020). Kuwait, like other countries dealt with repatriation, bringing more than 50,000 Kuwaiti
citizens from around the world back by May 7, 2020.
Due to the rapidly increasing number of detected cases and undetected community transmission
occurring within the first few weeks of the outbreak, Kuwait government officials acted quickly
to implement several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce person-to-person
transmission. Control measures to contain the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 included:
closure of a wide range of institutions (schools, universities, government offices and nonessential businesses), full border lockdown, partial curfew, and lockdown.

Despite early and aggressive control measures community transmission continued to occur. By
July 31, 2020 the Ministry of Health reported a total of 66,957 cases and 447 deaths
ths
(Worldometer, 2020). Kuwait and other countries faced with a lack of case data and early testing
ng
results implemented NPIs during a time of high uncertainty.
ial
To improve decision-making and better understand the effectiveness of NPIs we used social
contact rates within a deterministic model fitted to early case data. To realize this objective we
developed a susceptible (S), exposed but not infectious (E), infected but asymptomatic (A),
),
infected and symptomatic (I), and removed (R) due to recovery, isolation, hospitalization, or
death (SEAIR) model. The social contact rates were improved by using Google mobility data for
various interventions including school closures, business closures, lockdown and curfew
ew
(Google, 2020). The analysis can improve decision-making for NPIs during future pandemic
ic
waves.
2. Model and Methods
2.1. Model Description
We established a SEAIR disease transmission model to depict the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
Kuwait. We fit case data of the first 96 days of the epidemic to a multinomial likelihood function
on
dependent on the SEAIR model to estimate the relevant model‚Äôs parameters. We also derive and
nd
estimate the effective basic reproduction number
which is very close to the effective basic
sic
reproduction number
since the fraction of susceptible in the beginning of the epidemic stays
ys
close to one in this epidemic and the former also includes the fraction who are not practicing
ng
social isolation. We used it to understand what would have been the course of the epidemic
ic
under various NPI scenarios. We also used it to find the likely time of the peak of the epidemic
ic
if it was not for the 20-days lockdown.
The deterministic model is constructed from a set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) with
ith
the five states or compartments (S, E, A, I, R). (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the SEAIR model of COVID-19. S is the compartment of susceptible
ble
individuals. E is the compartment of exposed and latent individuals but not infectious yet. A is the compartment of
asymptomatic individuals. I is the infected individuals who are still able to interact with people (mildly infected) and
nd
choose not to isolate themselves. R is the removed individuals due to recovery, hospitalization, isolation, or death.

‡Æ∫ and ¬µ. While there is no guarantee that the optimal solution is no more than arguments for a
local maximum value of the likelihood function, we used various procedures to make sure what
we are finding is the best possible. Estimating the parameters was performed on the negative loglikelihood function using different methods provided by the Global Optimization Toolbox in
MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., USA). In one of the trials, we used a Latin Hyper-Cube sampling
to find a good initial point to start the optimization algorithms via the multi-start procedure that,
in its turn, starts the search from that point as well as other 99 initial points generated by the
procedure. We also used the Genetic Algorithm in the same toolbox and ran it parallel on 12
CPU cores with the appropriate options as provided by the documentation of the function in
MATLAB. In the Genetic Algorithm part, we commanded a mixed-integer optimization for the
initial data. We used the bootstrap method to quantify uncertainty in the estimates and calculate
confidence intervals (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993).
2.3. Kuwait Data Description
We used available case data from the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kuwait on
February 24, 2020 up to the beginning of the lockdown (May 10, 2020), a period of 96 days to
inform NPI effectiveness. During this first period of the epidemic (until day 76) NPIs and
policies implemented tended to be homogenous (ie. NPIs were applied uniformly to the entire

population). Testing had similar turnouts and reporting rates were very close giving confidence
in the data collected for fitting within our deterministic model. Country case data was provided
by the Ministry of Health, Government of Kuwait (Government of Kuwait, 2020).
3. Results
The parameters used in the following simulations are based on fitting the model‚Äôs parameters
that are relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic in the first 96 days starting on February 24, 2020,
see Figure 2 and Table 1. We estimated that it is highly likely that the epidemic was initiated by
one exposed child and one exposed adult, in addition to one infected young adult and one
infected senior.

3.1. Timeline and Scenarios
Social contact rates used in the SEAIR model for Kuwait were taken from our previously derived
social contact matrix (Al-Zoughool et al., 2020; Prem et al., 2019) and the effects on social
contact rates were updated using Google mobility data. Table 2 and Figure 4 show a timeline of
the various measures (interventions and transmission control strategies) implemented by the
government of Kuwait during the first wave of COVID-19. Modifications to population-level,

Based on estimation of the parameters of the model we have performed a scenario analyses and
sensitivity analysis. If the lockdown was not activated and the mobility observed on day 76 and
beyond continued then the expected epidemic peak would have happened on July 3, 2020.
3.2. Scenario Analysis
3.2.1. Scenario 1: No school closures compared to school shutdowns if applied on day 1 of the
outbreak (Feb. 24, 2020) (Figure 5).

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.21249409; this version posted January 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

Figure 5. The number of infected people (non-cumulative cases) resulting from either school closures or no school
closures. The start of the school closure began on day 8 (March 1, 2020) with the intervention in place until day 96,
the end of the lockdown.

The comparison of school closures versus no school closures and its effect on the total cases
from day 8 (March 1, 2020) until day 96 (May 31, 2020) shows that the school closure event
resulted in a 5.55 multiple reduction in cases.

3.2.2. Scenario 2: Shutdown of and non-essential services and government offices if applied on
day 1 of the outbreak (Feb. 24, 2020) (Figure 6).

Figure 6. The number of infected people (non-cumulative cases) over time shown with and without closure of nonessential businesses, if these closures were implemented on day 1.

The government of Kuwait implemented a number of closures within the first three weeks of the
COVID-19 outbreak including the closure of non-essential businesses (eg. cinemas, wedding
halls, retail businesses, and eat-in restaurants) on March 1; shutdown of government offices on
March 12; preventing mass gatherings (eg. prayers at the mosques) on March 13; and shutting
shopping centers on March 15. The estimated contact reduction achieved by these movement
restrictions was about 60% based on Google mobility data. The intervention to close nonessential services and businesses resulted in a 2.49 multiple drop in cases.

3.2.3. Scenario 3: Lockdown versus no lockdown (Figure 7) and estimating the outbreak peak
from fitted data and applying a lockdown under various timings and durations (Figure 8).

Figure 7. The number of non-cumulative cases (infected people) over time comparing the fitted data to a nolockdown scenario starting on day 76 of the Kuwait COVID-19 outbreak.

The government of Kuwait implemented a complete lockdown starting on May 10, 2020 (day
76) until May 31, 2020 (day 96). The effect of the full lockdown using Google mobility data
showed increased home contact rates 20-35%, reduced work contact rate to 80%, reduced
community contact rate by 80% as only grocery stores and essential services were allowed
(Google, 2020). The action of the lockdown resulted in a 1.78 fold reduction in the number of
cases.
Early modelling work predicted the peak of the first COVID-19 wave to occur in early May (AlShammari et al., 2020) and the government of Kuwait implemented its full lockdown to coincide
with this estimate. With the availability of early case data our model effort with data fitting
shows the COVID-19 peak was estimated to occur on day 132 (July 3, 2020). We show the

Figure 8. The number of infected people over time (non-cumulative, solid line) when full lockdowns are applied
for (a) 20-days (b) 40-days and (c) 60-days beginning 5 days before the estimated peak or (d) 30-days and (e) 60days of lockdown beginning 10 days before the estimated peak. In each case the lockdowns are compared to the
number of people infected without a lockdown (non-cumulative, dashed line).

We modeled the same 20-day lockdown (Figure 8, panel a) to reflect what realistically happened
and we used the actual mobility data to model the movement and contact changes that occurred
in Kuwait during the lockdown and in the days afterwards. The lockdown for 20 days if applied
to the estimated peak resulted in a very modest 1.03 fold reduction. Longer durations up to 60
days (Figure 8, panel b-c) yielded similar results. Enacting the lockdown 10 days prior to the
estimated peak for up either 30- or 60-days (Figure 8, panel d-e) while still showing modest fold
peak reduction showed an improved attenuation of the curve with reduced non-cumulative case
numbers.

Figure 9. The number of infected people (non-cumulative cases) for either curfew or no curfew from March 22,
2020 until May 31, 2020 (day 96, the end of the lockdown intervention).

The government of Kuwait implemented a partial curfew starting on March 22, 2020 and
extended the curfew hours on April 7. A full curfew was put in place on May 10 to coincide with
the start of the lockdown period for maximal contact reduction. The curfew hours were slowly
relaxed over the next several months, through Phases 2-4, and finally the curfew was ended on
August 30, 2020. We modelled the effect of a curfew versus no curfew scenario to show its
effects if applied over the first 96 days.
4. Discussion
We considered various scenarios with and without interventions to determine the impact of the
interventions in reducing the numbers of cases.

4.1. Scenario 1: Impact of school closures
Our scenario compares no school closures to school shutdowns if applied on day 8 of the
outbreak (March 1, 2020). The incidence of COVID-19 is far less in children than in adults.
Nevertheless there are concerns about asymptomatic or mild paediatric cases going undetected
and unknowingly transmitting SARS-CoV-2 in the community, inter-generationally and in
schools to teachers, staff and other students (Qui et al., 2020). Additionally, the elderly in
Kuwait‚Äôs families typically live together with younger generations in one dwelling, increasing
the concern of transmission from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children to their elderly
relatives. The epidemic dynamics of school closures and re-openings remains difficult to assess.
A study that used social-contact data of school-aged children in an individual-based stochastic
model in the USA found that school closures prevented a similar number of infections as
workplace closures and social distancing measures by adults. The stochastic model estimated
that school re-openings could increase symptomatic illness among middle and high school
teachers of approximately 40% and about 4% among elementary school teachers. The
transmission from children to other age groups was highly dependent on parameters with large
uncertainty such as the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children, and the extent of
community transmissions occurring at the time of the school re-opening.
The first NPI used in Kuwait was the closure of schools and universities on March 1, 2020. Our
model confirms the work by Head et al., (2020) with early school closures that had a positive
effect of reducing COVID-19 transmission by 5.55 fold.
Decision-makers can implement a number of interventions upon school re-openings including
reduced class sizes (cohorts of 20 elementary school students and cohorts of 10 middle or high
school students) (Head et al., 2020) and full time and a part-time rotational class strategies with
50% of students attending school with at-home learning on alternate days or weeks as a way to
reduce student density in the classrooms (Panovska-Griffiths et al., 2020).
Increased testing and contact tracing of both students and teachers, increased environmental
cleaning, socially-distanced desk arrangements, distance learning, masking wearing while away
from desks and maintaining social distance are some of the multiple in-school interventions
strategies that also can be used when schools re-open (Johansen et al., 2020; Simon et al., 2020;
Zhang et al., 2020).
4.2. Scenario 2: Impact of non-essential business closures
Kuwait closed non-essential services to slow down the distribution of COVID-19 in urban areas.
The shutdown of non-essential services occurred by the third week of the epidemic with the
closing of cinemas, wedding halls, and non-essential business venues (March 1, 2020);
government office closings (March 12, 2020) and shutting down shopping centres (March 15,
2020). The reduction in social conduct resulting from non-essential business closures resulted in
an estimated 2.49 fold reduction in cases.

In Wuhan, China the use of physical distancing with a staggered return to work after business
closures was calculated to be one of the most effective strategies for non-essential business reopening, with a projected reduction of the median number of infections by 92% (Prem et al.,
2020). This was similar to Kuwait's highly effective, gradual non-essential business re-opening
strategy with an initial 30% return to work (Phase II, starting June 30, 2020); then hotel and
mosque re-opening (Phase III, starting July 28, 2020); and government and private sectors reopened with 50% capacity of their workforce (Phase IV, starting August 18, 2020).
4.3. Scenario 3: Lockdown versus no lockdown
A country-level analysis measuring the impact of government actions showed that full
lockdowns when compared to partial lockdowns found that full lockdowns were strongly
associated with recovery rates (as measured by recovered cases per million people) (Chaudhry et
al, 2020). However, the timing and duration of the lockdown are critical factors to realize the
benefits of this intervention.
Previously we showed hypothetical modeling of a lockdown in Kuwait timed 5-10 days before
the estimated peak for 90-days in length yielded the optimal reduction in actual incidence and
hospitalization. (Al-Zoughool et al., 2020; Oraby et al., 2020). Such lengthy lockdowns, while
optimal, may not be practical resulting in devastating economic and psychosocial impacts.
According to our previous hypothetical stochastic modelling for Kuwait (Al-Zoughool et al.,
2020) a 20-day lockdown even if timed appropriately was likely too short to have much effect in
reducing the first peak. Our modelled scenario (Figure 8 panel a) considered a similar 20-day
lockdown beginning 5-days prior to the peak which we estimated to be on July 3, 2020. We did
not observe a major reduction in cases or a ‚Äútunneling effect‚Äù shown by a reduced number of
cases that would be split or bypass the peak from a 20-day lockdown. Previous hypothetical
modelling showed that optimal results and a tunneling effect could be achieved with a 90-day
lockdown (Al-Zoughool et al., 2020), while shorter duration lockdowns of 40-45 days, if timed
accurately, could also realize significant impacts to reducing case numbers and hospitalizations.
Our results suggest the 20-day lockdown implemented too far ahead of the actual peak was likely
only minimally effective.
We investigated longer lockdown durations of 40-days and 60-days starting 5 days before the
peak (Figure 8, panel b and c) which also appeared to have limited effects. However, 30-days
and 60-days of lockdown starting 10 days before the peak (Figure 8, panel d-e) both showed a
tunneling effect and a 25% reduction in the overall number of cases. Thus, a well-timed
lockdown initiated 10 days before the estimated peak for 30 to 60 days would bypass the peak.
This result is significant as it has the effect of reducing overall numbers of infections and
subsequently the numbers of severe cases entering hospitals which would help prevent exceeding
ICU bed availability and overwhelming available hospital resources.

4.4. Scenario 4: Curfew compared to no curfew
Curfew is a government mandated stay-at-home order limited to specific hours of the day as a
way to decrease contact between people and reduce community transmission of COVID-19.
Comparative analysis of curfews in Jordan compared to Kuwait and other gulf countries showed
using a country-wide curfew can be an effective NPI to reduce the spread of COVID-19 - if
implemented early with country-wide compliance (Khatatbeh, 2020). Kuwait enacted its first
curfew on March 22, 2020 (28 days after the country‚Äôs first confirmed case), by this time 176
confirmed cases already had been reported (Worldometer, 2020).
Comparing the intervention effects of a curfew versus no curfew showed that curfews can be
highly effective and similar to school closures when applied early. Figure 9 showed that limiting
the movement of people through curfews resulted in an estimated 6.60-fold reduction in cases.
5. Conclusion
The World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic
on March 11, 2020 (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). Several countries, including Kuwait, had
already quickly mobilized to respond to the emerging outbreak ahead of the WHO
announcement. Of the NPIs we reviewed (school closures, non-essential business closures,
curfews, and lockdown) many were implemented by almost all countries to some degree by the
end of March 2020 (Gollwitzer et al., 2020).
The SEAIR model we developed to review these early interventions captures and reflects this
first exponential phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Kuwait when the system was
homogeneous. We used modified social contact rates refined using Google mobility data to
better reflect changes in social contact rates in Kuwait. The data fitting analysis allowed for
calculation of the basic reproduction number ‡¨¥ . We found that the ‡¨¥
was significantly
dampened to about a third of its initial value. This affirms that the early intervention measures
implemented had a dramatic (and substantial) effect in attenuating the COVID-19 outbreak in
Kuwait.
The model also gives insights into what might have happened under different ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios
which can inform future control policy and decision-making in the event of future waves. Until
COVID-19 vaccines are more widely available and delivered to the population, the use of
non‚Äêpharmaceutical initiatives (NPIs) such as contract tracing with case isolation, school
closures, non-essential business closures, government office shut downs, banning mass
gatherings and public events, curfews and lockdowns are the best available options to restrict the
spread of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2.
Kuwait implemented a series of NPIs within the first few weeks of confirmed cases entering the
country and early use of interventions such as school closures, non-essential business closures
and curfews were highly effective in reducing case numbers. Our model suggests that, in
retrospect, the three-week lockdown would likely have been even more effective in alleviating

later hospital caseloads if its implementation were delayed to a time closer to the epidemic peak.
Such considerations, however, were impossible to know or predict at that time. However, these
prediction model results, based on real data from Kuwait, can help policy-makers in making
lockdown decisions in future outbreaks of COVID-19 or other infections.
All of the intervention measures aim at reducing the rate of infection transmission in the
community which both delays and reduces the magnitude of the epidemic peak. The actions
serve two purposes, first to allow additional time for the healthcare system to prepare and
respond efficiently to the pandemic wave and second, to manage the outbreak until the
development and deployment of potential new treatments and vaccines.
Finally, while the fitted case data provides a good retrospective review of the effects of NPIs for
the first wave of COVID-19 in Kuwait the lessons learned can be carried forward and applied to
future pandemic waves. Some NPIs (restrictions that create social distancing outside the
household or reduce movement of people) when applied early can be highly effective while other
interventions (full lockdown) appear to require more precision in their timing and duration.
