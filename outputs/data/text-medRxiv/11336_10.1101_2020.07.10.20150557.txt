Abstract

45

Passive transfer of antibodies from COVID-19 convalescent patients is being used as

46

an experimental treatment for eligible patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The United

47

States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) guidelines for convalescent plasma

48

recommends target antibody titers of 160. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

49

antibodies in sera from recovered COVID-19 patients using plaque reduction

50

neutralization tests (PRNT) at low (PRNT50) and high (PRNT90) stringency

51

thresholds. We found that neutralizing activity increased with time post symptom onset

52

(PSO), reaching a peak at 31-35 days PSO. At this point, the number of sera having

53

neutralizing titers of at least 160 was ~93% (PRNT50) and ~54% (PRNT90). Sera with

54

high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels (>960 ELISA titers) showed maximal activity, but not

55

all high titer sera contained neutralizing antibody at FDA recommended levels,

56

particularly at high stringency. These results underscore the value of serum

57

characterization for neutralization activity.

Introduction

62

The United States has been profoundly impacted by Coronavirus Disease 2019

63

(COVID-19) since the movement of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2

64

(SARS-CoV-2) viral infections out of China and across the globe in early 2020. As of

65

May 14, 2020, the United States had 1,390,764 confirmed COVID-19 cases and more

66

than 84,000 COVID-19-related deaths [1] [2]. The first documented COVID-19 case in

67

New York was reported on March 1, 2020. New York State currently accounts for the

68

largest portion of cases (340,661 with 27,477 deaths) in the United States [1] [3].

69

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be severe, especially among at risk populations (e.g.,

70

the elderly, especially with pre-existing co-morbidities) [4]. Nonetheless, up to 80% of

71

infections are thought to be mild or asymptomatic [5]. Humoral, or antibody (Ab)-

72

mediated, immunity is thought to protect an individual from viral infection by interfering

73

with virus-host cell interactions required for viral entry and replication. Vaccinated or

74

previously infected individuals with virus-specific Abs can also help prevent new

75

infections through herd immunity [6]. However, the duration and degree to which

76

asymptomatic infection or recovery from COVID-19 disease confers prolonged immunity

77

from reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is unclear, even among individuals who produce

78

virus-specific antibodies [7] [8]. Consequently, there a great interest in gaining a better

79

understanding of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the serological tests that measure

80

them [9] [10].

81

Due to the lack of effective treatments, current COVID-19 outbreak management

82

emphasizes social distancing, expanded diagnostic testing and isolation of known cases

83

and quarantine of close contacts. The resulting economic and societal disruption

84

exacerbates the public health impact of COVID-19, and there is an urgent need to

85

define correlates of immunological status to identify individuals who may have protective

86

immunity. Passive transfer of Ab from convalescent COVID-19 patients is being used

87

as treatment of seriously ill COVID-19 patients, although its efficacy has not yet been

88

rigorously evaluated. Recovered COVID-19 patients who have generated robust Ab

89

responses to SARS-CoV-2 are being sought to fill a growing need for plasma donors to

90

support this therapy. A lack of standardization or information about the relative

91

neutralizing capacity of Abs from convalescent donors complicates implementation and

92

evaluation of plasma therapy protocols for COVID-19. The U.S. Food and Drug

93

Administration (FDA) has issued a recommendation that the titer of neutralizing Abs in

94

convalescent plasma should be at least 160, but allows that an 80 titer is acceptable in

95

the absence of a better match [11]. However, this guidance does not specify the level of

96

virus neutralization that should be achieved at these titers or how to measure it.

97

Several approaches to measuring relative levels of neutralizing antibody exist, including

98

plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) and microneutralization (MN) [12] [13].

99

Here we chose the PRNT, which measures the ability of Ab in serially diluted sera or

100

plasma to decrease virus infection of cultured cells at a minimum threshold (e.g., 50%

101

or 90%). PRNT is a relatively low throughput assay because it takes several days for

102

development of virus plaques, which are the units of measurement. MN assays can

103

provide a higher throughput alternative, but the need for BSL3 containment during

104

SARS-CoV-2 culture remains a barrier. As a result of these limitations, determination of

105

Ab neutralization activity has not been routinely adopted by many COVID-19 plasma

donor screening programs; instead donors are chosen based on Ab levels or time since

108

The purpose of this study was to measure SARS-CoV-2 specific Abs in the sera of

109

COVID-19 convalescent individuals to characterize the humoral immune response in

these individuals, and correlate this response to Ab neutralizing activity, and evaluate

neutralizing activity in the context of FDA recommended guidelines for selection of

Methods

115

Study Participants

116

Specimens were collected with informed consent obtained from individuals in

117

accordance with guidelines of Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) and the Westchester County

118

Department of Health (WCDH). Testing at the Wadsworth Center was done under a

119

declared Public Health Emergency with a waiver from the NYSDOH Institutional Review

120

Board.

121

Study Set 1. Sera were obtained from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19

122

during a recruitment effort to identify plasma donors for passive Ab transfer therapy.

123

Seropositivity assessment on these specimens was done by enzyme-linked

124

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at MSH Laboratory [14, 15]. A sliding recruitment was

125

done to increase the selection of recovered COVID-19 patients at later stages of

126

convalescence. Of the 3277 people who entered the study by April 12, 2020, 227 had a

127

positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test at MSH, Labcorp, or the New York City Department of

128

Health and Mental Hygiene, and 621 had a self-reported positive PCR result. An

129

additional 1423 had antibodies reactive in the ELISA at 1:50 dilution and were

130

considered “true” COVID-19 recovered individuals.

131

A progressive approach was used to define eligibility for the donor candidate screening

132

in this cohort. For the first 3 days of the study, the Ab screening criteria included

133

patients who were at least 10 days beyond the onset of symptoms or diagnostic PCR

134

test and asymptomatic for 3 days. With each subsequent week of the study, selected

135

patients were deeper into the convalescent phase, where increased Ab responses

136

would be expected based on other viral infections [16] [17]. By the third week, all

137

patients had to be 21 or more days from the start of infection, and 14 or more days from

138

full recovery.

139

Study Set 2. To specifically determine antibody levels and neutralizing antibodies in

140

individuals well-removed from the onset of symptoms, sera from 149 healthy, recovered

141

COVID-19 individuals from Westchester County were screened as potential donors of

142

passive Ab therapy. The WCDH recruited individuals as potential plasma donors if they

143

had confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results at least 21 days before the date of

144

serum collection and were symptom free for at least 14 days. Ascertainment of

145

symptom free status was done by interviewing the individual at the time the

146

arrangements were made for phlebotomy. Antibody testing for the Westchester cohort

147

was done at the Wadsworth Center using a microsphere immunoassay (MIA).

148

Immunoassays

149

ELISA: The initial description of this FDA EUA test and methodological details are

150

described elsewhere [14] [15]. This ELISA detects Abs that are reactive with the SARS-

151

CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and the entire spike protein ectodomain. For

152

most of the sera described in this report, specimens were screened initially at a 1:50

153

dilution using the SARS-CoV-2 RBD as the target antigen and specific IgG was

154

detected. The endpoint titers of the “presumptive screen positive” sera were then

155

determined by ELISA using the whole recombinant spike ectodomain as the target

156

antigen.

157

MIA: The NY SARS-CoV-MIA is a suspension phase assay using the Luminex platform.

158

This is an FDA EUA test and the details and performance characteristics are described

159

elsewhere [18]. For all specimens included in this study, the MIA measured reactivity to

160

the SARS-CoV-1 nucleoprotein (N) antigen that had been coupled to polystyrene

161

microspheres. Total antigen-specific immunoglobulin was measured using a biotinylated

162

goat anti-human Ig (reactive with IgM, IgA, and IgG), followed by detection with

163

phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 N Ab are strongly identified

164

due to extensive amino acid identity between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (~90%),

165

and ongoing studies show that the substitution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein provides

166

essentially identical results (WTL, unpublished observations). Many of the sera

167

assessed in this study were also evaluated using the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen in the

168

MIA, multiplexed in conjunction with the N protein. With some exceptions, both

169

antigens were reactive with the same sera. For the MIA assay positivity is defined as 6

170

standard deviations (SD) above the mean Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of the

171

signal from 90 pre-2019 blood donor sera from presumed healthy individuals. The high

172

cutoff maximizes specificity (99%) to identify sera with moderate to high amounts of

173

SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies and excludes potential cross-reactivity with other

174

respiratory viruses. Results for which the MFI signal falls between 3 SD and 6 SD

175

above the mean MFI of normal sera are considered “Indeterminate”.

176

PRNT: This assay has been previously described and is considered the classical

177

standard for detection of virus-specific Abs based on their ability to neutralize their

178

cognate viral infections [13] [19] [20]. For the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

179

Abs, 100 ul of 2-fold serially diluted test sera were mixed with 100 ul of 200 plaque

containing 0.2% Neutral red was applied, and the number of plaques in each sample

Results

193

Characterization of tested specimens

194

For this study period, 3277 specimens from convalescent COVID-19 individuals were

195

screened for SARS-CoV-2 RBD Ab reactivity using the ELISA assay at MSH. Of these

196

specimens, 2398 were also tested for Abs at the Wadsworth Center using the MIA. An

197

additional 171 serum specimens, submitted directly to the Wadsworth Center from the

198

WCDH, were tested for the presence of Abs to the SARS CoV N protein. For the

199

specimens tested at both MSH and the Wadsworth Center, the two assays (ELISA and

200

MIA, respectively) showed 79.3% agreement (Supplementary Table 1). If the MIA

201

indeterminates (3 SD) were also counted as reactive, the agreement increased to

202

87.6%. Inclusion of RBD with the N protein in the MIA resulted in agreement levels of

203

89.7.2% (6 SD) and 90.6% (3 SD). A direct comparison of the values provided by the

204

two tests showed the strongest correlation between the MIA RBD protein and the ELISA

205

spike protein (Supplementary Figure 1).

206

In the MSH cohort, the titers of SARS-CoV-2 Abs were determined for those specimens

207

that were positive for RBD binding at a greater than 1:50 dilution in the initial screen.

208

Over the three-week course of the study, a higher proportion of sera showed

209

increasingly higher titers, presumably reflecting maturation of the immune response.

210

Supplementary Table 2 shows distribution of serum titers of samples received during

211

the final 9 days of the study, when most individuals would be expected to be > one

212

month post symptom onset (PSO). As indicated, 89.9% of the “screen positive” sera

213

had SARS-CoV-2 titers that exceeded a 320 threshold. We noted that 10% of the Ab

214

positive sera failed to meet a 320 titer threshold for strong Ab responses even three

weeks from initial symptom onset. In sera that were collected from the WCDH cohort of

216

convalescent individuals who were at least 21 days PSO, the MIA showed reactivity for

217

that 83.2% (6 SD) or 90.6% (3 SD) of the specimens. A composite analysis of Ab levels,

218

as indicated by differences in MIA signal intensities is shown in Figure 1.

219

Relationship between antibody production and virus neutralizing antibody.

220

A main protective function of anti-viral antibodies is to prevent infection by interfering

221

with essential virus-host cell interactions such as receptor binding, virus entry, and

222

membrane fusion [7] [21]. Neutralization can be measured by PRNT, which we used to

223

determine the levels of neutralizing Abs in two cohorts of recovered COVID patients. All

224

sera used were reactive in the NYS SARS-CoV MIA, and most specimens were tested

225

using a multiplexed MIA that included the SARS-CoV-2 RBD along with the N protein.

226

Our objective in this portion of the study was to identify those sera that met the

227

recommended (160) or minimal (80) titers for convalescent plasma proposed by the

228

FDA at both the 50% (PRNT50) and 90% (PRNT90) neutralization levels.

229

We examined the relationship between ELISA and PRNT titers using sera collected by

230

MSH to determine whether a direct correlation could be made between Ab reactivity in

231

the ELISA and neutralizing activity. Analysis of 159 sera showed that, as expected,

232

there was a general trend toward more neutralization with higher Ab titers (Table 1).

233

Approximately half (52.9%) of the samples had a ≥160 neutralizing titer PRNT50 level,

234

including 84.1% of sera with an ELISA titer of 2880. However, only 50% of the sera at

235

the highest ELISA Ab titer (2880) had neutralizing titers of 160 or greater when a more

236

stringent (PRNT90) determination for neutralization was used. Figure 2 shows a

237

graphical representation of these data, except that results are grouped to show the

238

frequencies of specimens that met the minimal FDA recommended 80 and 160 titers for

239

convalescent plasma use (“Medium”) in addition to frequencies of specimens that either

240

failed to meet that recommendation (“Low”) or exceeded the recommended titers

241

(“High”).

242

In general, samples with high Ab titers by ELISA also had high MIA MFIs, consistent

243

with overall agreement between the two Ab detection assays. Likewise, we found that

244

specimens with higher amounts of Ab detected using the MIA, had higher levels of

245

neutralizing Ab activity (Figure 3). Although more overall Ab led to more neutralizing Ab,

246

we did not find a specific MFI value to be an absolute predictor of neutralizing activity.

247

Specimens with similar Ab (MFI) levels could be found at each level of neutralization

248

(Low, Medium, High), although their frequencies varied. In a smaller sampling, we

249

substituted the RBD antigen for the N antigen in the MIA and, again, found no MFI value

250

that predicted whether the specimen would be a strong neutralizer (data not shown).

251

More individuals made higher levels of Ab as time from symptom onset increased, so

252

we examined neutralization titers over different time periods PSO to explore whether

253

more neutralizing Abs were produced after longer recovery periods. PRNT analysis of

254

~300 sera from the combined cohorts demonstrated that, consistent with overall Ab

255

production, neutralization activity also increased with time after symptom onset. The

256

peak of neutralization in this study was at 31-35 days PSO (Table 2), where ~93% of

257

the sera had ≥ 160 PRNT50 titers, while ~54% of the sera had ≥ 160 titers using the

258

more stringent PRNT90 evaluation. Beyond 35 days, the number of sera which had

Discussion

264

At present, plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients for passive Ab transfer is being

265

investigated as an experimental treatment for patients severely ill with COVID 19.

266

Passive transfer is an old method that has seen recent use during infectious disease

267

outbreaks to combat infections by pathogens, such H1N1 influenza virus, Ebola virus,

268

and notably, MERS CoV and SARS CoV [22]. As a potential emergency therapy for

269

COVID-19, at least two groups have reported compassionate use and some success in

270

passive transfer of immune plasma into critically ill COVID-19 patients [23] [24].

271

Controlled trials are urgently needed to establish the parameters for effective therapy,

272

but the success of this approach relies upon the presence of protective antibodies in the

273

sera of recovered, presumably immune, individuals. The FDA has provided limited

274

nonbinding recommendations for investigative COVID-19 convalescent plasma use

275

based on current knowledge [11].

276

For viruses in general, a main advantage of Ab protection lies in its ability to block the

277

interaction between the virus and its cellular receptor in the host, thereby preventing

278

entry into the cell and viral replication [25]. Although the relationship between

279

neutralizing Ab and immune protection from many virus infections is established, many

280

questions remain to be answered about the levels of neutralizing Abs needed to confer

281

immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

282

Surprisingly, we found that while most individuals made moderate to high levels of

283

SARS-CoV-2 specific Ab, a smaller than expected number met the FDA recommended

284

titers of neutralizing Abs [11], as determined by a PRNT. These results suggest that

285

measurement of Ab neutralizing activity has significant potential to enhance the

286

effectiveness of plasma therapy for COVID-19 through improved donor selection

287

criteria. In this study most recovered COVID-19 individuals made detectable

288

neutralizing Abs when measured using a PRNT50, but only half the sera with a 960

289

ELISA titer against the spike protein had a neutralizing titer of at least 160, the FDA

290

recommended level of titer. While a 2880 ELISA titer was predictive of neutralizing

291

activity at 160 with PRNT50, only 50% of these individuals reached the 160-titer

292

recommendation at the PRNT90 level. The FDA has not recommended a specific assay

293

or stringency level, and further studies are critically needed to define the optimal levels

294

of neutralizing antibodies for plasma therapy [11].

295

Through the use of two cohorts, we also found that ELISA IgG results correlated well

296

with the means of the MIA MFI values. However, we observed greater variation in

297

SARS-CoV-2 reactivity among individuals in this study than we have in our previous

298

experience using the MIA for Ab detection for other viruses [26, 27] . Whether the

299

variation in antibody production that we observed here is unique to responses to SARS-

300

CoV-2 needs further study.

301

Our results parallel the recent findings of Wu et al that approximately 30% of recovered

302

COVID-19 patients, examined two weeks after discharge from hospitals, generated low

303

titers of SARS-CoV2 specific neutralizing antibodies [28]. However, others have

304

reported higher levels of correlation between antibody levels and neutralizing activity,

305

including a smaller study that evaluated serial samples from 12 COVID-19 patients [29]

306

and a larger study using a pseudo-typed virus neutralization assay [28]. A recent study

307

using the MSH ELISA and an optimized and sensitive MN assay recently also found

308

high IC50 neutralization titers and excellent correlation between ELISA and MN assay

309

[30]. Our results indicate that high level Ab quantitation is a useful, but imperfect, guide

310

to donor suitability, depending on the required level of neutralization. Additional factors,

311

including the specific target antigen used to measure antibody levels, should also be

312

considered.

313

As expected, we found that timing post infection had a major impact on the degree of

314

neutralizing activity present. Our finding that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody

315

responses are most abundant at 31-35 days PSO is similar to the >21-days PSO peak

316

in neutralizing antibody titer observed for SARS-CoV-1 [31] but later than the two to

317

three weeks PSO reported by others [28] [32] [29] [24]. The drop in neutralizing activity

318

we observed beyond 35 days PSO raises the possibility that there is a relatively narrow

319

window for choosing the “best” sera for treatment, particularly at the more stringent

320

PRNT90 level of neutralization. It is critical to determine the level of neutralization

321

required for effective plasma therapy as we further study this experimental treatment. In

322

particular, the level of stringency required for neutralization must be defined, as this

323

affects the interpretation of FDA recommendations regarding plasma titers. While the

324

1:160 neutralization recommendation from FDA may be higher than necessary, we note

325

that the European Commission suggests using a minimum titer of 320 [33].

326

At present, the extent to which neutralizing Abs contribute to protection from reinfection

327

by SARS-CoV-2 is not known and the use of either low stringency (PRNT50) or high

328

stringency (PRNT90) evaluative methods might not reflect the true requirements for

329

protection. For example, significant protection against influenza virus infection is

330

observed at 40 titers [34] and protection from measles virus infection correlates with 120

331

PRNT50 titers [35]. However, the optimal level of neutralizing Abs for plasma therapy is

332

likely to differ from that required for an individual's own immune status, as donor plasma

333

will be diluted as much as ten-fold upon transfer into a recipient and protection from

334

viruses after infection or vaccination is not just limited to neutralizing antibodies [36].

335

The mechanisms for potential immunity to SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be determined.

336

There are limited reports about the protective cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2

337

[37], although there are numerous reports about cellular immunopathology and negative

338

consequences for the disease [38]. Strong cellular immunity could more than

339

compensate for low virus neutralizing capacity. A recent study testing an inactivated

340

whole virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (PiCoVacc) in non-human primates reported low

341

neutralizing titers post-vaccination but found evidence of protection from disease in

342

animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 three weeks after vaccination [39]. Thus, high

343

neutralizing antibody titers may not be required for protection from reinfection with

344

SARS-CoV-2.

345

While establishing the relationship between PRNT titers and efficacy of plasma therapy

346

for treatment of COVID-19 will require the results of controlled trials, we think the data

347

presented here point to the need to thoroughly characterize individual plasma used for

348

passive Ab therapy. At a minimum, the time period between symptom onset and serum

349

collection may need to be refined to prioritize establishing the precise PRNT titer of the

350

sera prior to clinical use. Rapid neutralization assays that can be done in less restrictive

351

biocontainment conditions and/or better-defined correlates for neutralizing activity are

352

clearly needed for understanding and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and should be

353

prioritized for further study.
