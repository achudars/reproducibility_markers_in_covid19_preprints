ABSTRACT
Background: ​Although there are reports on COVID-19 in pediatrics, it is possible that the
characteristics of each population, their health systems and how they faced the pandemic
made the disease show distinctive features in different countries.
We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a tertiary
pediatric hospital in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Methods: Descriptive study, including all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a tertiary
pediatric

hospital,

from

04/26/2020

to

10/31/2020.

Demographic,

clinical

and

epidemiological characteristics of the patients are described.

Results: ​In the studied period 578 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19. The median age

Regarding severity, 30.8% were asymptomatic, 60.4% mild, 7.4% moderate, and 1.4%
severe. Among those with symptoms, the most frequent was fever, followed by sore throat
and cough.
Conclusion: We reported 578 cases of children and adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19,
most of them showed a mild or asymptomatic condition.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, the
information available to date shows that the disease is less severe in the pediatric population
[1,2].
Also, there are reports that seem to show that the development of the pandemic may be
influenced by the characteristics of each country, their health systems and how they faced the
pandemic [3,4].
In addition to the characteristics of their own population and health system, Argentina faced
the pandemic in a particular way, including the longest lockdown [5] and mandatory
hospitalization of affected infants, regardless of its severity [6]. These characteristics could
give a distinctive feature to children hospitalized for this disease.
We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a pediatric
tertiary hospital in the City of Buenos Aires.

METHODS
Descriptive study, including all patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the Hospital General
de Niños Pedro de Elizalde, Buenos Aires, from April 26 to October 31, 2020. Besides
patients admitted for COVID-19, all cases which require hospitalization for other reasons
were also tested. The diagnosis was made by identification of SARS-CoV-2 in
nasopharyngeal secretions by RT-PCR.
In all cases, sex, age, place of residence (including whether they lived in a poor neighborhood
[7]), time of symptoms onset on admission, close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case,
presence of comorbidity and length of hospitalization was registered.

Severity

was

assessed

as

described

by

Dong

[8];

patients

presenting

with

SARS-CoV-2-related multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were considered
severe/critical.
Lab tests were also recorded (hemoglobin, differential WBC count, platelets, C-reactive
protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).
Analysis: Categorical variables are described by proportions with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) and continuous variables with mean and standard deviation or median and
interquartile range, according to distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). IBM SSPS
Statistics 20.0 was used.
Ethics:​ The study was approved by the Institution Ethics Committee.

RESULTS
In the studied period, 578 children and adolescents were hospitalized for COVID-19. The
number of hospitalizations per week ranged between 2 and 42. (Figure 1)
The median age was 4.2 (IIC: 0.7-11.2) years and 54.5% were male. Sixty-seven percent
(67.3%) had their residence within the jurisdiction of the hospital (City of Buenos Aires) and,
of them, 23.1% lived in a poor neighborhood.
Eighty-three percent (83%) had a history of close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.
The time of symptoms onset before admission was 1 day (IIC: 1-3). Thirty-five percent
(35.3%) had a previous or concomitant diagnosis of other disease, asthma being the most
frequent (n = 49) (Table 1).
Disease severity was assessed and 30.8% were considered asymptomatic, 60.4% mild, 7.4%
moderate, and 1.4% severe. From the six severe cases, only one required assisted ventilation,
and two presented with SARS-CoV-2-related multisystemic inflammatory syndrome

(MIS-C). Other six MIS-C cases were admitted to the hospital but SARS-CoV-2 testing was
negative at that moment.
The most frequent initial symptom was fever, followed by sore throat and cough (Table 2).
Regarding the lab tests, we found that 9% showed lymphopenia (lymphocyte differential
count <20%) and 23.8% elevated C-reactive protein values ​(C-reactive protein > 10 mg/dl)
(being 100% among severe cases and 10% among asymptomatics)(Table 3).
The length of stay had a median of 6 days (IIC: 2.2-9).
At the time of this report, only one patient with COVID 19 died, due to causes other than the
disease, since he was in end-of-life care. All patients were discharged without complications
(with phone follow-up), except those whose comorbidity prevented it.

DISCUSSION
Our study strengthens the idea that COVID 19 in pediatrics is, in general, mild. It also
supports some characteristics of the disease in Argentina that a previous report has suggested
[9].
Although it is possible that the age structure (Argentina has twice the number of children
under 15 years of age than Italy) and the social behaviour of the different populations
influence the differences observed [10] [11], the way in which local health authorities dealt
with the pandemic have generated some particular features in our patients. We found more
pediatric cases than other countries and a higher proportion of asymptomatic and mild among
those hospitalized.
The City of Buenos Aires, adopted a “test and trace” policy. This program was carried out
more strongly in poor neighborhoods, which have a younger population [12]. Mandatory
hospitalization was also established for infants, still asymptomatic [6] [13]. Furthermore,

those asymptomatic children and adolescents who did not have home conditions to comply
with out-of-hospital isolation, were hospitalized for the isolation period [14].
In the period covered by this report (until 10/31/2020) the City of Buenos Aires reported
147,363 cases, of which 12.1% were children and adolescents [15], a substantially higher
proportion than that initially reported in China (2.1 %) [16] and Italy [17], but closer to that
lately reported in the USA (9%) [18].
We found a high proportion of asymptomatic patients (30.8%), higher than that reported by
Götzinger in Europe in 582 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection (16%) [19], probably
related to the above mentioned test and trace and institutional isolation policies adopted by
the health authorities.
We only found 5.6% moderate and 1.2% severe cases. Dong et al. in China reported 5.9%
severe and critical cases [8] and Tagarro in Spain reports that 9.7% of the cases in his series
were severe [20]. Although a report from the United States showed that 32% of hospitalized
pediatric patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the PICU, the limited average length of
stay (2 days) and the limited proportion of subjects who required assisted ventilation (5.8%)
suggests that the admission criteria in this series were broader [21].
Regarding the cases of MIS-C (COVID-19 associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome
in Children) that we report, they presented 4 to 6 weeks after reaching a significant number of
cases in our city, a moment described as usual for the development of this complication [22].
Finally, we have found that 83% of our patients had close contact with infected people,
supporting the idea that children are usually infected from adults [23].
This study has the limitation of presenting data from a single center, although it is probably
the public institution that has hospitalized the most pediatric patients with COVID-19 in our
country.

CONCLUSION
In this study we report 578 cases of children and adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19 in
Argentina. Most presented their disease as mild or asymptomatic.
