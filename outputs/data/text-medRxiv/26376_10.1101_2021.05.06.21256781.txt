Abstract

2

We systematically investigated the transcriptomes of the peripheral immune cells from 6

3

inactivated vaccine, BBIBP-CorV recipients at 4 pivotal time points using single-cell RNA-seq

4

technique. First, the significant variation of the canonical immune-responsive signals of both

5

humoral and cellular immunity, as well as other possible symptom-driver signals were

6

evaluated in the specific cell types. Second, we described and compared the common and

7

distinct variation trends across COVID-19 vaccination, disease progression, and flu vaccination

8

to achieve in-depth understandings of the manifestation of immune response in peripheral blood

9

under different stimuli. Third, the expanded T cell and B cell clones were correlated to the

10

specific phenotypes which allowed us to characterize the antigen-specific ones much easier in

11

the future. At last, other than the coagulopathy, the immunogenicity of megakaryocytes in

12

vaccination were highlighted in this study. In brief, our study provided a rich data resource and

13

the related methodology to explore the details of the classical immunity scenarios.

Introduction

3

As of May 2021, World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 148 million Coronavirus

4

disease

5

(https://covid19.who.int/). Promotion and popularization of vaccine is vital to disease control,

6

with its safety and efficacy of the top priority. There are multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines

7

available and several vaccines under development, including the inactivated, genetically

8

engineered subunit, adenovirus and nucleic acid vaccine types. So far, a number of institutions

9

of different countries and regions have reported the results of safety and immunogenicity of

10

SARS-CoV-2 vaccine on phase III clinical trials or phase III interim analysis, such as, vaccines

11

BNT162b21

12

inactivated vaccines BBIBP-CorV5 and CoronaVac6, 7, and protein subunit vaccine NVX-23738.

13

For example, Ugur Sahin et al.9 demonstrated that RNA vaccine (BNT162b2) not only elicited

14

adaptive humoral, but also stimulated the cellular immune response even at the low-dose

15

vaccine. The new vaccine types such as adenovirus-vectored vaccines and RNA vaccines have

16

emerged and fast developed with good efficacy in recent years, though severalserious adverse

17

events have been reported10, 11 12, 13. Their efficacy and long-term safety were yet to be reviewed

18

by a follow-up study. With the support of long clinical practice, traditional inactivated vaccines

19

play an irreplaceable role in the prevention and control of infectious disease. As a pattern of

20

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, BBIBP-CorV, was manufactured by Sinopharm China

21

National Biotec Group (CNBG) and contained a SARS-CoV-2 strain inactivated inside Vero

22

Cells14, which was confirmed for its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in clinical trials of

23

healthy people in China5 and UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Jordan (https://cdn.who.int/) .

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technique has demonstrated its power in the research

pandemic of COVID-19 has prompted the demand of single-cell studies in order to uncover the

31

and detailed reference information of this disease, though, no results have been reported for any

32

COVID-19 vaccines yet. Moreover, a comprehensive comparison of the human immune

33

responsive signals across the transcriptome at single-cell resolution over the time becomes

34

practical and necessary. With no doubt, such detailed comparison facilitates the in-depth

understanding of the pathogenesis, symptom development and immunization of COVID-19

2

which guides us to the better vaccination strategy. Therefore, we aimed to look through a 'sight

3

glass' of the human immunity system, a.k.a., peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to

4

monitor the manifestation of vaccine response of the canonical immune cells. In the meantime,

5

we could take the advantage of the recent published scRNA-seq datasets of COVID-19 patient

6

samples21 and Flu vaccination samples22 to achieve such a goal. Besides, the roles of

7

megakaryocytes/platelets in COVID-19 recently have attracted some attentions due to recent

8

reports of blood-clot side effect by AZD122212,

9

contribute to the complication of COVID-19 patients and be correlated to the organ failure and

10

mortality24, 25, 26. We were therefore also interested in looking into the signals related to immune-

11

responsive and coagulopathy in this non-canonical immune cell type using the scRNA-seq

12

dataset.

23

. Megakaryocytes were also found to

13

In this study, we extensively investigated the PBMC samples of BBIBP-CorV vaccine

14

recipients. Our scRNA-seq data delineated a high-resolution transcriptomic landscape of

15

peripheral immune cells during the vaccination of a classical vaccine type. Meanwhile, we

16

integrated the PBMC scRNA-seq datasets of COVID-19 patients and flu vaccination in order

17

to identify the common and distinct variation trends among our data set and the two other data

18

sets. All these efforts could provide a rich data resource and demonstrate a methodology to

19

explore the human immunity in disease development and vaccination at great details. Moreover,

20

this work could facilitate the in-depth understandings of the manifestation of immune response

21

in peripheral blood under different stimuli and provide many clues to design the new assay for

22

the assessment of the immune protection and adverse effects after the vaccination or infection

23

recovery.

Overview of immune responses and peripheral immune cells variations by scRNA-seq

27

To assess the immune cells content and the phenotypic alterations following the vaccination

28

with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV), six healthy young adults with 4 males

29

and 2 females from Pu Dong Cohort, China, were enrolled in this 2019-nCoV vaccine

30

observational study [NCT04871932] according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig.1A). All

31

six volunteers received 2 doses of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBIBP-CorV). Blood

32

samples were collected at 4 time points including the day before vaccination (BV), 7 days after

33

first dose (1V7), 7 days after second dose (2V7) and 14 days after second dose (2V14) (Fig.

34

1A). Then, serum and PBMCs were separated from all time points of samples within 2-hour of

collection. The 2019-nCoV Spike RBD antibodies and cytokines were measured in serum. After

2

isolating the PBMCs, we profiled V(D)J repertoires of T and B cells integrated with 5' Gene

3

Expression using droplet based single-cell sequencing method (10× Genomics) (Fig.1A).

4

Based on the integrated single-cell gene expression profiles, we recovered the

5

transcriptomes of ~120k high-quality cells in total from 24 samples and the total cells were

6

combined and projected in a 2-D space using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding

7

(t-SNE). Unsupervised clustering analyses and marker mapping enabled us to uncover 11 major

8

types (Fig.1B). The markers for the 11 major immune cell lineages were shown on Fig.1C. As

9

the shown in Fig.1D, summary statistics of the 11 cell-type fractions showed plasma cells

10

increase significantly after the second dose, whereas the other 10 cell types pretty much

11

remained the same level.

12

Previously, Wang et al.14, Xia et al.5 have already demonstrated the satisfactory efficacy

13

by increasing seroprotective antibody titers in the animal experiments and human clinical trials

14

by this vaccine type. To further validate the efficacy in our participants, we measured 2019-

15

nCoV Spike RBD antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.

16

Anti-S-RBD-specific IgG antibody level significantly increased after the second dose for total

17

6 participants (Fig.1E). The growth of plasma cells content and the observable production

18

neutralizing antibody by second dose suggests the robust humoral immune response. The

19

cellular immunity was also assessed. 10-cytokine serum assays were first performed on the total

20

24 samples on bead-based flow-cytometric assays on the BD LSRFortessa X-20 platform,

21

though, no obvious post-vaccination increase was observed (Fig.S1A). We then used an ultra-

22

sensitive bead-array-based immunoassay (single-molecule array technique) to validate the IL-

23

4 signal and found that the quantification was consistently lower (one order of magnitude) than

24

the readings of BD LSRFortessa X-20 platform (Fig.S1B), which suggested, 1. most of the

25

cytokines remained low level at these time points. 2. limit of quantification of bead-based flow-

26

cytometric assays likely above the real concentrations of these cytokines in these samples (Fig.

27

S1B).

29

Classical immune responsive signals of major immune cell types in vaccination.

30

After the successful characterization of the major cell types, we were interested in investigating

31

the gene expression patterns in the major immune cell types. The differentially expressed genes

32

(DEGs) were first identified in 11 cell types by the comparisons between the post-vaccination

33

samples vs. the pre-vaccination samples (BV). The DEGs list was shown in Supplementary

34

table 1. The unsupervised clustering of these DEGs exhibited a pattern of 3 dominant clusters

1

for the 24 samples in most of the cell types. We used the heatmap of B cells as an example to

2

demonstrate the sample clusters (Fig.2A). The red cluster included the samples mostly in the

3

2V7 or 2V14 time points, which reflected an active immune responsive state (R-state). The

4

green cluster included the samples mostly in early BV or 1V7 time points, which likely reflected

5

the baseline or minor-responsive state (B-state). The blue cluster covered broader time points,

6

which likely reflected a post-vaccination protection state (P-state) or recovery state. The

7

identical clustering patterns were observed when the regulons heatmap were calculated and

8

plotted using SCENIC27 (Fig.2B). Such unsupervised clustering provided an unbiased sample

9

grouping. More details of the signal variabilities by heatmaps for the major 6 cell types were

10

shown in Fig.S2A-2J.

11

The DEGs were re-calculated based on the updated sample clusters (B-R-P) and the

12

following 15 variable signaling keywords were identified based on these DEGs. The updated

13

DEGs list for this comparison was shown in Supplementary table 2 and showed very little

14

change. The coordinated gene expressions of a certain functional group or signaling pathway

15

suggested their involvement in the response to BBIBP-Corv vaccination. We used simple

16

schematic diagrams to illustrate the 5 dominant patterns of signal variation observed in the

17

heatmaps to delineate the variability of immune-responsive signals in B-R-P state as Fig.S2K.

18

As expected, we observed the elevation of the monocytes' type I interferon production

19

signal (Fig.2C, pattern 2), which was an essential signal of innate immunity for viral

20

suppression. We also observed significant elevation of the antigen-specific follicular T helper

21

cell (Tfh) activation (CD40LG, ICOS, SLAMF1, etc.) (Fig.2D, pattern 2) and the B cell

22

activation signal (TLR7, CD80/CD86, BCL6) (Fig.2E, pattern 2), that were associated with

23

neutralizing antibody production. In the meantime, we evaluated the expression of different

24

classes of constant gene of Immunoglobulin heavy chain. The IGHG went up and IGHM went

25

down in protection state (P-state), suggesting the occurrence of class switching of neutralizing

26

antibody molecules (Fig.2F).

27

TCR responsive signals (VAV3, AKT3, MALT1, MAPK1, etc.) (Fig.2G, pattern 1), as well

28

as cytotoxic signal were also enhanced (Fig.2H, pattern 3). These lymphocyte-related signals

29

contributed to antigen-specific immunity, a.k.a., adaptive immunity.

30

The immune regulatory signals such as TGF-β pathway (TGFB1, TGFBR1/2, SMAD2/3/4,

31

etc.) (Fig.2J pattern 5), and T cell exhaustion (LAG3, PDCD1) (Fig.2I pattern 4) were

32

suppressed in the high immune-responsive samples (R-state) until they went up to play their

33

roles in the protection state (P-state).

34

We also identified some changes contradictory to the expectation. For example, NF-κB

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256781; this version posted May 10, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

1

signal was expected to be upregulated in the most of the immunity situation (Fig.S2L). However,

2

NF-κB signal actually went down (pattern 4). Second, instead of enhancing the antigen

3

presenting, MHC I signal significantly dropped in most of the peripheral immune cell types in

4

R group (Fig.2L, pattern 4). Though, type II MHC genes mostly went up as expected (Fig.2K,

5

pattern 2). Later, when we examined COVID-19 dataset21, we didn't observe such changes in

6

COVID-19 patients. Why this change occurs and what outcomes will this change brings are

7

elusive.

8

Other variabilities of the classical immune-responsive signals including cell-cycles and

9

apoptosis (Fig.S2M-2N) were summarized in Supplementary table 3. High cell-cycle signal

10

(ORC2, CCNH, CDC7, CDK7, etc.) and low apoptosis signal (BAX, BAD, TP53, etc.) indicated

11

the high proliferative potential of the cells in R-state samples.

12
13

Characteristic transcriptions of the top TCR and BCR clones

14

As our scRNA-seq study also included TCR and BCR V(D)J sequencing results, it allowed us

15

to track down the TCR/ BCR clonal expansion in these samples. The results showed the

16

diversities of the T cell and B cell clones wend down after vaccination due to the expansion of

17

the antigen-specific clones (Fig.3A, 3D and 3G). The top 20 abundant clones of both T cells

18

and B cells were pulled out to investigate their characteristics in comparison with the low

19

abundance clones as the counterpart.

20

First of all, it was found that top BCR clones were enriched in the samples after second

21

dose, indicating the observable clone expansion occurred after the second dose. Second, it was

22

found that the top 20 clones were highly correlated to low MHC II signal and high B cell

23

activation signal (Fig.3B and 3C). This was expected, though, it was still encouraging to

24

confirm that the possible antigen-specific B cells could display transcriptional signature in the

25

peripheral blood, which made it more specific to access the antigen-specific BCR sequence

26

using single-cell sequencing technique.

27

Top TCR clones didn't necessarily occur in the post-vaccination time, which made it less

28

straightforward to confirm their vaccine-specificity. We were still able to find the correlation

29

between the top T cell clones and the immune-responsive signals. In CD4+ T cells, it was found

30

that the top clones were associated with high follicular T helper (Tfh) and low NF-κB signal

31

(Fig. 3E and 3F). In CD8+ T cells, it was found that the top clones were associated with high

32

cytotoxic but low NF-κB signal (Fig.3H and 3I).

1

Non-trivial roles of megakaryocytes in vaccine immunity

2

Megakaryocytes were mostly recognized for its role in the hemostasis and wound healing. Little

3

has been discussed for its contribution in the disease or vaccine immunity. After examining this

4

atypical immune cell type, we observed the gene expression variation of megakaryocytes in

5

vaccine immunity.

6

First, the variation of platelet aggregation signal (GP9, ITGB3, TBXA2R, FLNA, VASP,

7

etc.) in megakaryocytes (Fig.4A and 4B, pattern 4) were identified. These genes were

8

significantly down-regulated in the immune-responsive samples (R-state), which suggested low

9

risk of thrombosis during the period of BBIBP-CorV vaccination. Later, when we inspected the

10

same set of genes in the COVID-19 patients21 and influenza vaccination22 samples at the

11

corresponding immune-responsive time point, instead of getting down-regulated, we found the

12

platelet aggregation signal significantly went up (dashed red box in Fig.4E and Fig.S3D). That

13

means, the variation of platelet aggregation signal could be distinct by different vaccines.

14

As a myeloid-lineage cell type, it was found that megakaryocytes actually contributed

15

more inflammatory signal than we thought, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) production (TLR4,

16

IFI16, CASP1, CASP8, NLRP1, NLRP2, etc.) and neutrophil activation (SA0018, S100A12,

17

FCER1G, VNN1, etc.) (Fig.4A, 4C and 4D). The expression levels of the related genes were

18

actually as high as the monocyte population (Fig. S2O and S2P), which was considered the

19

dominant cell type of innate immunity in PBMCs. In flu vaccination, we observed the elevation

20

of IL-1β production and neutrophil activation signal as well at 28-day sample, the putative high

21

response time point (Fig. 4F and 4G). All these results suggested the roles of megakaryocytes

22

in pathogenesis and vaccination should not be overlooked.

23
24

Transcriptomic similarity and distinction of COVID-19 and vaccination immunity in

25

PBMC

26

It was postulated that the dysregulated immune response could be reflected in differential

27

signals between the COVID-19 infection patients and the vaccine recipients. We were

28

particularly interested in looking for the signatures that were associated to the symptom

29

development and the later immune protection. By examining the similarity and the distinction

30

of the developmental trend of these signals, we aimed to gain more insights of both disease

31

development and vaccine protection.

32

We used the keywords in Supplementary table 3 to assess the COVID-19 samples. There

33

were three natural sample groups in previous COVID-19 study, i.e., healthy control, progression

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256781; this version posted May 10, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

1

samples of mild and severe symptoms and the convalescent samples of both patient types21.

2

Other than the resemblance between COVID-healthy samples and the vaccine-baseline samples,

3

it was intuitively believed that the COVID-convalescence samples were similar to the vaccine-

4

protection samples (P-state). What do these immune signals vary in the progression samples are

5

of our interest.

6

Many of the abovementioned signals only showed an obvious turning point at

7

convalescence group, including type I interferon productions, Tfh and B cell activation, TGF-

8

β, cell-cycle, apoptosis and so forth (Fig.5A. and Fig.S3A-S3B). We were able to observe

9

obvious signal boundary line between healthy/progression samples and convalescence samples.

10

That means, unlike what happened in vaccination, some of the critical signals of immunity were

11

not initiated but suppressed until the recovery.

12

In general, there were many immune responsive signals in certain cell types in the

13

progression samples whose trends were similar to those in R-state of vaccination. For examples,

14

cytotoxic signal in T cells and NK cells significantly increased in the patients’ progression

15

samples consistent with Zhang et al. and Wilk et al. study17, 28 (Fig.S3C).

16

We also revealed the distinctions between disease immunity and vaccination immunity

17

using both datasets, especially for type I and type II MHC. In those antigen presenting cells like

18

B cells and monocytes, type I MHC signal significantly decreased in vaccine response group

19

(R group) whereas it tended to increase in the progression patients (Fig.5B). Type II MHC signal

20

was suppressed in progression in both mild or severe patients (Fig.5B), whereas it was up-

21

regulated during the vaccination. Another distinction was that T cells exhaustion signal went

22

down in vaccination but went up in progression patients (Fig.S3C).

23

In summary, we identified the distinct signal variation patterns between the COVID-19

24

progression and vaccination samples, such as 1. type I and II MHC signals 2. T cells exhaustion

25

signal.

26
27

Potential effects of the identified variable classical immune signals in flu vaccination

28

To further evaluate the responsive role of the variable classical immune signals we had

29

identified in inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, a specific comparison was adopted with a

30

public scRNA-seq data set on the lymph nodes and PBMC samples of the quadrivalent

31

influenza vaccination22. This data set was designed for a single-dose vaccine and included 5

32

time points of PBMC samples with a long post-vaccination follow-up time (2 months).

33

Using the 15 variable signaling keywords identified in BBIBP-Corv vaccination and the

34

involved differential genes, we calculated their modular scores for each cell in flu dataset. The

1

signal curves showed that 28-day sample gave the most obvious variation in response to the flu

2

vaccine compared to other time points. We were able to detect high B cell activation signal in

3

B cells (Fig.5C), high cytotoxic signal in CD8+T cells (Fig.5D), and low TGF-β signal (Fig.5E)

4

in most of the immune cells at 28-day time point.

5

Elevated B cell activation, elevated cytotoxic signals and suppressed TGF-β signal at 28

6

days suggested this sample was mostly corresponding to the COVID-19-vaccine samples at

7

immune R-state. We were not able to detect the variation of other signature signals, possibly

8

because their sampling missed the pivotal time point on this volunteer. The megakaryocytes

9

also had shown the significant variation at the same time point, which was mentioned earlier

10

(Fig.4E).

11
12

Discussion

13

In this study, we extensively investigated the variability of the single-cell transcriptomes of the

14

peripheral immune cells in the process of vaccination by a classical inactivated viral vaccine.

15

Single-cell sequencing technology enabled us to deconvolute the immune-responsive signals

into specific cell types.

17

Unsupervised clustering on the cell types from these samples defined three dominant

18

clusters of the immune cells that were putatively corresponding to different immune-responsive

19

states. Such an unbiased method overcame the challenge of sample grouping by the distinct

20

immune-background, vaccine susceptibility or variable pace of immune responses by different

21

participants.

22

The coordinated up-/down- regulation of the gene expressions of a certain signaling

23

pathway suggested their involvement of the immune response during the vaccination. Tracking

24

down the variation of these signals in a typical vaccination process allowed us to uncover their

25

possible roles in the immune protection. Using this method, we observed the activation of both

26

humoral immunity and cellular immunity by BBIBP-CorV, including cytotoxicity, follicular

27

helper T mediated immunity as well as B cell activation et al. Meanwhile, our results provided

28

a good reference for the future study of other vaccine types.

29

Surprisingly, we observed the down-regulation of NF-κB signal in the post- BBIBP-CorV

30

vaccination PBMC samples. Previous study suggested that the suppression of NF-κB signal

31

likely alleviated the vaccine adverse reaction29, 30, which might partially explain much less

32

adverse reaction cases was reported by the vaccine recipients of BBIBP-CorV. Even though,

33

the antibody productions of our participants were satisfactory.

The correlation between the top TCR/BCR clones and the modular scores of the keywords

reveals what phenotypes have been associated with the clones of expansion. Some of the

2

signature transcriptions identified in this work enabled us to capture the target B cells for full-

3

length sequencing and molecular cloning of the antigen-specific antibodies.

4

The platelet aggregation signal and inflammatory signals were also inspected in the

5

megakaryocytes due to the rising concern on the blood-clot side-effects reported on several

6

vaccine types10,11, 12. This cell type was usually overlooked in immunity, though, in response to

7

vaccine, the inflammatory gene expressions in megakaryocytes not only commensurate with

8

the monocytes but also in a coordinated fashion. In addition, unlike severe COVID-19 samples

9

and influenza vaccine samples, our result showed a down-regulation of blood-clot-related gene

10

expression in our samples under active response (R-state), which likely explained the much

11

fewer reports of thrombus-related adverse events by BBIBP-CorV vaccine5.These findings

12

necessitate a more extensive investigation on the roles of the megakaryocytes in the human

13

immunity in the future.

14

The comparison of the immune-responsive signals between the COVID-19-progression

15

and the vaccination allowed us to identify the discrepancy of immune responsive signals and

16

made it possible to locate the missing puzzle pieces of the unsuccessful or incomplete immunity

17

that contributed the symptoms in patients. These signaling pathways could be used to assess the

18

immunity or as the target of the intervention for the control of COVID-19 symptoms or the

19

vaccine adverse reaction. Though, more validation experiments will need to be done in the

20

future.

21

We also inspected these signals using the dataset generated from a single-dose flu vaccine

22

recipient22. The results showed a significant fluctuation, especially, the B cell activation signal

23

displayed a peak at 28-day. This was concordant to the detection of high content of

24

CD20hiCD38int B cells from lymph nodes at 28-day in the original paper, though, a single case

25

study might limit the power of this study.

26

Our study has some limitations. Due to the currently high cost of single-cell sequencing

27

and inaccessibility of other vaccine type at the moment, the coverage and the size of sampling

28

of this study are relatively limited, which limits the power of this study. Due to the urgent need

29

of COVID-19 related research, the follow-up time couldn’t be long enough, either.

30

Despite of these limitations, we were able to observe the protective immunity induced by

31

BBIBP-CorV at the single-cell level and identified a set of genes that not only featured the

32

immune-responsive variation of the peripheral immune cells but also exhibited many

33

interpretable signaling pathways. The signature expression described in here might facilitate to

34

design a new assay to assess the immune protection and adverse effects after the vaccination or

Participants and ethics

5

All human samples used in this study were processed under Institutional Review Board

6

approved protocols at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. All study participants were recruited after

7

providing informed consent and with approval by the Ethics Committee of Ren Ji Hospital

8

(KY2021-046), School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and the study was

9

conducted according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki31 (2013). This study was

10

registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04871932). A written informed consent letters were

11

routinely obtained from all participants in the study and all relevant ethical regulations

12

regarding human research participants were complied with by the investigators. Six healthy

13

non-frail individuals who had not received any vaccine in the past one year were recruited in

14

the Pu Dong Cohort, China, including 4 males and 2 females, aged 30-40 years old. All

15

participants were confirmed negative result of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR tests and

16

negative result for serum SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM/IgG-antibody ELISA tests. The

17

participants had no history of epidemiological contact of COVID-19 patients. They were free

18

of clinical symptoms including fever, cough, headache, sore throat, malaise, loss of smell, runny

19

nose, abdominal pain, diarrhea, joint pain, wheezing or dyspnea within 28 days before

20

vaccination; They were also free of any steroid usage, chronic diseases, pregnancy, lactation,

21

and obvious allergy to any known ingredients contained in the inactivated vaccine.

Antibody and Serum cytokine detection

11

The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike RBD IgG in serum were tested using Sino

12

Biological® SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) Spike RBD Antibody Titer Assay Kit (Catalog

13

Number: KIT002) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance was read at 450 nm

14

with a subtraction at 570 nm by MultiSkan FC reader (51119000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,

15

Waltham, MA, USA).

16

The protein levels of IFN-γ, IFN-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-

17

17A and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α in serum were tested using Aimplex kit (Hang zhou

18

CEGER P010041), a multiplex beads-based flow cytometric assay, following the

19

manufacturer’s instructions. The concentrations of IL-4 in the serum samples were further

20

assayed using the ultra-sensitive single molecule array immunoassay on Medivh SX-L platform

21

(ColorTech Biotechnology, Suzhou, China). Samples were incubated with anti-IL-4 capture

22

antibody coated magnetic beads and biotinylated detection antibody to form the immuno-

23

complex. Then beads were loaded into femto-sized array for detection.

Single-Cell RNA-seq library construction and sequencing

26

Using a Single Cell 5’ Library and Gel Bead kit (10× Genomics, 1000006) and Chromium

27

Single Cell A Chip kit (10× Genomics, 120236), the cell suspensions (600–1000 living cells

28

per ul as determined by Count Star) were loaded onto a Chromium single cell controller (10×

29

Genomics) to generate single-cell gel beads in the emulsion (GEMs) following the

30

manufacturer’s protocol. Approximately 12,000 cells were added to each channel and

31

approximately 7,000 target cells were recovered. Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared using

32

the Chromium Single Cell 5’ v2Reagent (10× Genomics, PN-1000263) was used to prepare

single-cell RNA libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sequencing library

2

was generated with a unique sample index. The libraries were sequenced using Illumina

platform with a sequencing depth of at least 100,000 reads per cell and 150 bp (PE150) paired-

4

end reads (performed by GENE SHINE, Shanghai).

Single-Cell Data Processing

7

The matrices of unique molecular identifier (UMI) were generated for each sample by the Cell

8

Ranger (10× Genomics, Version 4.0.0) Pipeline coupled with human reference version GRCh38

9

(10× Genomics, Version 3.0.0.) using STAR (version 2.5.1b). Then the expression matrix was

10

analyzed by R software (v.3.6.0) with the Seurat package (v.3.0.0) and DoubletFinder (version

11

2.0.2) for filtering, data normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering (Butler et al., 2018).

12

The filtered scRNA-seq data were analyzed with the following steps: 1. To remove the cells

13

with low quality, cells with fewer than 500 genes detected and a mitochondrial gene ratio of

14

greater than 10% were excluded. And genes with at least one feature count in more than three

15

cells were used for the following analysis. 2. To remove potential doublets, cells with UMI

16

counts above mean ± 2SD are filtered out. Additionally, we applied DoubletFinder package

17

(version 2.0.2) to identify potential doublets. 3. For each cell, we normalized the gene

18

expression profiles with SCT-transform in Seurat package. 4. Variable genes were selected

19

using the ‘FindVariableFeatures’ function with the default parameters. 5. Variable genes were

20

projected onto a low-dimensional subspace using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) across

21

samples to correct batch effects by using the ‘RunMultiCCA’ functions. 6. A shared nearest

22

neighbor graph was constructed based on the Euclidean distance in the low-dimensional

23

subspace spanned by the selected significant principal components. Cells were clustered using

24

the ‘FindClusters’ function at an appropriate resolution. 7. Cells were visualized using a 2-

25

dimensional t-distributed stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) algorithm with the

26

‘RunTSNE’ function. Using the above pipeline, we processed the scRNA-seq data of ~120k

27

high-quality cells from 24 samples.

Reference Single-Cell Datasets in comparison

30

Other than the scRNA-seq dataset generated in this study on the participants of BBIBP-CorV

31

vaccination, we also used the published PBMC scRNA-seq dataset to make meaningful

32

comparison over the immune-responsive signals. The dataset on COVID-19 patients came from

GEO accession GSE15805521 and the dataset on flu vaccine came from GEO accession

2

GSE14863322.

Cell-type annotation and cluster marker identification

5

After nonlinear dimensional reduction and projection of all cells into two-dimensional space by

6

tSNE, cells were clustered together according to the similar features. ‘FindClusters’ function

7

was used to define the unsupervised clusters. “FindAllMarkers” function in Seurat was used to

8

find markers for each cluster. Clusters were then preliminarily classified and annotated based

9

on expressions of canonical markers and signature genes of particular cell types. In total, we

10

identified 11 major cell types including CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells (CD3D, CD3E, CD3G,

11

CD40LG, CD4, CD8A, CD8B), γδ T cells (TRDV2, TRGV9), B cells (MS4A1, CD79A, CD79B),

12

plasma cells (JCHAIN, MZB1), NK cells (NCAM1, GNLY, NKG7), Monocyte and Dendritic

13

cells (CD14, FCGR3A, CST3, LYZ, FCER1A, CD1D, LILRA4) and Megakaryocytes (Mega)

14

(PPBP, PF4). We also used SuperCT33 and 31 reference cell types [https://github.com/weilin-

15

genomics/rSuperCT_models] to predict the cell types of the total 120k cells. SuperCT

16

predictions were used to for cross-validation. We assigned the final cell types based on the entire

17

cluster rather than single cells. The dominant prediction for the cluster will correct the

18

discrepancy in the same cluster. Additional details of prediction on top of SuperCT 31-type,

19

such as γδT cells, mDC, pDC were assigned by the enriched markers and detailed cell-type

20

boundaries were determined by the Seurat ‘FindClusters’ function with default parameters.

21
22

Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and function enrichment

23

The gene expression signals of a certain cell group (by cell type and by sample) were

24

represented by copy number per million UMIs (CPM). See details in the following equation.
𝐶𝑃𝑀𝑖,𝑘 =

25
26
27

∑𝑗 𝑒𝑖,𝑗,𝑘
∙ 106
∑𝑖 ∑𝑗 𝑒𝑖,𝑗,𝑘

Let 𝑒 be number of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) of i gene determined by unique
molecular barcode in a certain cell j in group k.

28

The CPMs of each gene were compared using student tests by pairwise or non-pairwise

29

groups. P value < 0.01 was used as a threshold to define the significant differential expression

30

genes (DEGs).

31

When we compared the differential genes between the post-vaccination time points and

32

the base line samples, we could use pairwise t-test by each individual. When we compare the

differential genes across B-R-P sample groups, we could only use independent t-test.
GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses on these DEGs identify the biological
keywords, that allowed us to summarize the keywords of classical immune responsive signal.

Transcriptional factor analysis

6

To identify the potential regulatory transcription factors that dictate the vaccine response, the

7

regulons in major cell types were assessed using SCENIC27 with scaled expression matrix as

8

input. The regulons expression profile cluster plots were visualized using the ComplexHeatmap

9

package of R.

10
11

Assessment of the overall signal score of the keywords of immunity

12

We used cellular modular scores to assess the immune state after infection or vaccination. We

13

selected differentially expressed genes enriched in MSigDB 34 to calculate the modular scores.

14

The involved genes for 12 immune-responsive signals were shown in supplemental table3. The

15

modular score of a certain keyword was calculated with ‘AddModuleScore’ function in Seurat

16

with default settings. The keywords signal score of different immune state were analyzed by

17

two-sided wilcox test and all differences with p < 0.05.

18
19

TCR and BCR V(D)J sequencing and analysis

20

TCR and BCR clonal types were determined using CellRanger V(D)J pipeline（10× Genomics,

21

Version 4.0.0）. TCR/BCR diversity was measured as Shannon’s entropy using ‘H’ function in

22

philentropy package:

30

H = − ∑ xp(x) ∗ log2[p(x)]

23

in which the p(x) represents the frequency of a given TCR/BCR clone among all T/B cells

24

with TCR/BCR identified. The TCR/BCR diversity among different times was analyzed by

25

two-sided Student’s t-test and all differences with p < 0.05. We loaded the clonal type

26

information from the CellRanger V(D)J output to the meta data of the seurat objects based on

27

the barcode mapping. The cells belonging to the top 20 TCR and BCR clones were labeled as

28

‘top-clones’. The gene expression signal and the immune responsive signals were compared

29

between the top-clones and their counterparts using Seurat ‘VlnPlot’ function.
