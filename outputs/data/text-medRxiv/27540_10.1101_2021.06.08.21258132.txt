Aspirin for COVID-19
28

SUMMARY

29

Background: Aspirin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 on the basis

30

of its antithrombotic properties.

31

Methods: In this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible

32

treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

33

Eligible and consenting adults were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either usual

34

standard of care plus 150mg aspirin once daily until discharge or usual standard of

35

care alone using web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation

36

concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. The trial is registered with

37

ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

38

Findings: Between 01 November 2020 and 21 March 2021, 7351 patients were

39

randomly allocated to receive aspirin and 7541 patients to receive usual care alone.

40

Overall, 1222 (17%) patients allocated to aspirin and 1299 (17%) patients allocated to

41

usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0·96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·89-1·04;

42

p=0·35). Consistent results were seen in all pre-specified subgroups of patients.

43

Patients allocated to aspirin had a slightly shorter duration of hospitalisation (median

44

8 vs. 9 days) and a higher proportion were discharged from hospital alive within 28

45

days (75% vs. 74%; rate ratio 1·06; 95% CI 1·02-1·10; p=0·0062). Among those not

46

on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in

47

the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or

48

death (21% vs. 22%; risk ratio 0·96; 95% CI 0·90-1·03; p=0·23). Aspirin use was

49

associated with an absolute reduction in thrombotic events of 0.6% (SE 0.4%) and an

50

absolute increase in major bleeding events of 0.6% (SE 0.2%).

51

Interpretation: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, aspirin was not associated

52

with reductions in 28-day mortality or in the risk of progressing to invasive mechanical

53

ventilation or death but was associated with a small increase in the rate of being

54

discharged alive within 28 days.

Aspirin for COVID-19
60

INTRODUCTION

61

Thrombosis is a key feature of severe COVID-19, with 5-30% of hospitalised patients

62

(depending on illness severity) experiencing a major venous thromboembolic event

63

(mostly pulmonary embolism) and up to 3% an arterial thromboembolic event,

64

particularly myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke.1,2 The risk of thromboembolic

65

complications is reported to be higher in COVID-19 than in other acute medical

66

illnesses and viral respiratory infections, and is associated with worse prognosis.3,4

67

Antiplatelet therapy may have beneficial effects in severe COVID-19 through several

68

mechanisms including inhibition of platelet aggregation, reduction of platelet-derived

69

inflammation, and blocking thrombogenic neutrophil extracellular traps and

70

disseminated intravascular coagulation.5 Aspirin is an affordable, globally available

71

drug which at low doses irreversibly inhibits the COX-1 enzyme which is responsible

72

for production of thromboxane A2 and pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Aspirin can

73

reduce both arterial and venous thrombotic events and has been shown to abolish in-

74

vitro hyperactivity in platelets from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.6,7 Existing

75

randomized evidence has shown that 75-150mg aspirin daily is as effective as higher

76

doses in preventing cardiovascular events.6

77

Seven clinical trials of aspirin in COVID-19 are registered but none have yet reported

78

on the effect of aspirin therapy in COVID-19. Here we report the results of a large

79

randomised controlled trial of aspirin in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

82

Study design and participants

83

The Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 therapy (RECOVERY) trial is an

84

investigator-initiated, individually randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial to

85

evaluate the effects of potential treatments in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.

86

Details of the trial design and results for other treatments evaluated (lopinavir-ritonavir,

87

hydroxychloroquine,

88

plasma, and colchicine) have been published previously.8-14 The trial is underway at

89

177 hospitals in the United Kingdom, two hospitals in Indonesia, and two hospitals in

90

Nepal (appendix pp 5-25), supported in the UK by the National Institute for Health

91

Research Clinical Research Network. The trial is coordinated by the Nuffield

92

Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford (Oxford, UK), the trial

93

sponsor. The trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the International

94

Conference on Harmonisation–Good Clinical Practice guidelines and approved by the

95

UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the

96

Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee (ref: 20/EE/0101). The protocol,

97

statistical analysis plan, and additional information are available on the study website

98

www.recoverytrial.net.

99

Patients admitted to hospital were eligible for the trial if they had clinically suspected

100

or laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical history that might, in

101

the opinion of the attending clinician, put the patient at significant risk if they were to

102

participate in the trial. Children aged <18 years were not eligible for randomisation to

103

aspirin. Patients with known hypersensitivity to aspirin, a recent history of major

104

bleeding, or currently receiving aspirin or another antiplatelet treatment were

azithromycin,

tocilizumab,

excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, or a legal

106

representative if they were too unwell or unable to provide consent.

107

Randomisation and masking

108

Baseline data were collected using a web-based case report form that included

109

demographics, level of respiratory support, major comorbidities, suitability of the study

110

treatment for a particular patient, and treatment availability at the study site (appendix

111

p33-34). Eligible and consenting adult patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either

112

usual standard of care or usual standard of care plus aspirin using web-based simple

113

(unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealed until after randomisation

114

(appendix p30). For some patients, aspirin was unavailable at the hospital at the time

115

of enrolment or was considered by the managing physician to be either definitely

116

indicated or definitely contraindicated. These patients were excluded from the

117

randomised comparison between usual care plus aspirin and usual care alone.

118

Patients allocated to aspirin were to receive 150 mg by mouth (or nasogastric tube) or

119

per rectum daily until discharge.

120

As a platform trial, and in a factorial design, patients could be simultaneously

121

randomised to other treatment groups: i) azithromycin or colchicine or dimethyl

122

fumarate versus usual care, ii) convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody (REGN-

123

CoV2) versus usual care, and iii) baricitinib versus usual care (appendix pp 30). Until

124

24 January 2021, the trial also allowed a subsequent randomisation for patients with

125

progressive COVID-19 (evidence of hypoxia and a hyper-inflammatory state) to

126

tocilizumab versus usual care. Participants and local study staff were not masked to

127

the allocated treatment. The trial steering committee, investigators, and all other

130

Procedures

131

A single online follow-up form was completed when participants were discharged, had

132

died or at 28 days after randomisation, whichever occurred earliest (appendix p 35-

133

41). Information was recorded on adherence to allocated study treatment, receipt of

134

other COVID-19 treatments, duration of admission, receipt of respiratory or renal

135

support, and vital status (including cause of death). In addition, in the UK, routine

136

healthcare and registry data were obtained including information on vital status (with

137

date and cause of death), discharge from hospital, receipt of respiratory support, or

138

renal replacement therapy.

139

Outcomes

140

Outcomes were assessed at 28 days after randomisation, with further analyses

141

specified at 6 months. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary

142

outcomes were time to discharge from hospital, and, among patients not on invasive

143

mechanical ventilation at randomisation, progression to invasive mechanical

144

ventilation (including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) or death. Prespecified

145

subsidiary clinical outcomes were use of non-invasive respiratory support, time to

146

successful cessation of invasive mechanical ventilation (defined as cessation of

147

invasive mechanical ventilation within, and survival to, 28 days), use of renal dialysis

148

or haemofiltration, cause-specific mortality, major bleeding events (defined as

149

intracranial bleeding or bleeding requiring transfusion, endoscopy, surgery or

150

vasoactive drugs), thrombotic events (defined as acute pulmonary embolism, deep

151

vein thrombosis, ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial

153

reactions was collected in an expedited fashion to comply with regulatory

154

requirements.

155

Statistical Analysis

156

An intention-to-treat comparison was conducted between patients randomised to

157

aspirin and patients randomised to usual care but for whom aspirin was both available

158

and suitable as a treatment. For the primary outcome of 28-day mortality, the log-rank

159

observed minus expected statistic and its variance were used to both test the null

160

hypothesis of equal survival curves (i.e., the log-rank test) and to calculate the one-

161

step estimate of the average mortality rate ratio. We constructed Kaplan-Meier survival

162

curves to display cumulative mortality over the 28-day period. We used the same

163

method to analyse time to hospital discharge and successful cessation of invasive

164

mechanical ventilation, with patients who died in hospital right-censored on day 29.

165

Median time to discharge was derived from Kaplan-Meier estimates. For the pre-

166

specified composite secondary outcome of progression to invasive mechanical

167

ventilation or death within 28 days (among those not receiving invasive mechanical

168

ventilation at randomisation), and the subsidiary clinical outcomes of receipt of

169

ventilation and use of haemodialysis or haemofiltration, the precise dates were not

170

available and so the risk ratio was estimated instead.

171

Prespecified subgroup analyses (defined by characteristics at randomisation: age,

172

sex, ethnicity, level of respiratory support, days since symptom onset, and use of

173

corticosteroids) were performed for the primary outcome using the statistical test of

174

interaction (test for heterogeneity or trend), in accordance with the prespecified

175

analysis plan (appendix p 113). A sensitivity analysis restricting analysis of the primary

outcome to patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-COV-2 was conducted. In

177

addition, post-hoc exploratory analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes by

178

venous thromboprophylaxis treatment at randomisation was conducted. Observed

179

effects within subgroup categories were compared using a chi-squared test for

180

heterogeneity or trend, in accordance with the prespecified analysis plan.

181

Estimates of rate and risk ratios are shown with 95% confidence intervals. All p-values

182

are 2-sided and are shown without adjustment for multiple testing. The full database

183

is held by the study team which collected the data from study sites and performed the

184

analyses at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford

185

(Oxford, UK).

186

As stated in the protocol, appropriate sample sizes could not be estimated when the

187

trial was being planned at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (appendix p 53). As the

188

trial progressed, the trial steering committee, whose members were unaware of the

189

results of the trial comparisons, determined that sufficient patients should be enrolled

190

to provide at least 90% power at a two-sided significance level of 1% to detect a

191

clinically relevant proportional reduction in 28-day mortality of 12.5% between the two

192

groups. Consequently, on 21 March, 2021, the steering committee, masked to the

193

results, closed recruitment to the aspirin comparison as sufficient patients had been

194

recruited.

195

Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 and R version 4.0.3. The trial is

196

registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

RESULTS

204

Between 1 November 2020 and 21 March 2021, 14892 (66%) of 22560 patients

205

enrolled into the RECOVERY trial were eligible to be randomly allocated to aspirin (i.e.

206

aspirin was available in the hospital at the time and the attending clinician was of the

207

opinion that the patient had no known indication for or contraindication to aspirin, figure

208

1). 7351 patients were randomly allocated to usual care plus aspirin and 7541 were

209

randomly allocated to usual care alone. The mean age of study participants in this

210

comparison was 59.2 years (SD 14.2) and the median time since symptom onset was

211

9 days (IQR 6 to 12 days) (webtable 1). At randomisation, 5035 patients (34%) were

212

receiving thromboprophylaxis with higher dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),

213

8878 (60%) with standard dose LMWH, and 979 (7%) were not receiving

214

thromboprophylaxis.

215

The follow-up form was completed for 7290 (99%) participants in the aspirin group and

216

7457 (99%) participants in the usual care group. Among participants with a completed

217

follow-up form, 6587 (90%) allocated to aspirin received at least one dose and 210

218

(3%) allocated to usual care received at least one dose of aspirin (figure 1; webtable

219

2). Of the 6587 participants allocated to aspirin that received at least one dose of

220

aspirin, 5040 (77%) received aspirin on most days following randomisation (≥90% of

221

the days from randomisation to time to discharge or 28 days after randomisation,

222

whichever was earlier). Use of other treatments for COVID-19 was similar among

223

participants allocated aspirin and among those allocated usual care, with nearly 90%

224

receiving a corticosteroid, about one-quarter receiving remdesivir, and one-eighth

225

receiving tocilizumab (webtable 2).

226

Primary and secondary outcome data are known for 99% of randomly assigned

227

patients. We observed no significant difference in the proportion of patients who met

228

the primary outcome of 28-day mortality between the two randomised groups (1222

229

[17%] patients in the aspirin group vs. 1299 (17%) patients in the usual care group;

230

rate ratio 0·96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0·89 to 1·04; p=0·35; figure 2, table 2).

231

The rate ratio was similar across all pre-specified sub-groups (figure 3). In an

232

exploratory analysis restricted to the 14467 (97%) patients with a positive SARS-CoV-

233

2 test result, the result was virtually identical (rate ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0·89 to 1·04;

234

p=0·31).

235

Allocation to aspirin was associated with a reduction of 1 day in median time until

236

discharge alive from hospital compared to usual care (median 8 days vs. 9 days [IQR

237

for each 5 to >28 days]) and an increased rate of discharge alive within 28 days (75%

238

vs. 74%, rate ratio 1·06, 95% CI 1·02 to 1·10, p=0·0062) (table 2). Among those not

239

on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the number of patients progressing to

240

the pre-specified composite secondary outcome of invasive mechanical ventilation or

241

death among those allocated to aspirin was similar to that among those allocated to

242

usual care (21% vs. 22%, risk ratio 0·96, 95% CI 0·90 to 1·03, p=0·23). There was no

243

evidence that the effect of allocation to aspirin vs. usual care on time until discharge

244

alive from hospital or on invasive mechanical ventilation or death differed between the

245

pre-specified subgroups of patients (webfigure 1, webfigure 2). In a post-hoc

246

exploratory analysis there was no evidence that the effect of allocation to aspirin vs.

247

usual care on the primary and secondary outcomes differed by use of LMWH use at

248

randomisation (webfigure 3).

249

We found no significant differences in the prespecified subsidiary clinical outcomes of

250

cause-specific mortality (webtable 3), use of ventilation, successful cessation of

251

invasive mechanical ventilation, or receipt of renal dialysis or haemofiltration (table 2).

252

As expected with the use of aspirin, the incidence of thrombotic events was lower

253

(4.6% vs. 5.3%; absolute difference 0.6%, SE 0.4%) and the incidence of major

254

bleeding events was higher (1.6% vs. 1.0%; absolute difference 0.6%, SE 0.2%) in

255

the aspirin group (webtable 4). The incidence of new cardiac arrhythmias was similar

256

in the two groups (webtable 5). There were 18 reports of a serious adverse event

257

believed related to aspirin, all of which were due to haemorrhagic events (webtable 6).

258
259

DISCUSSION

260

In this large, randomised trial involving over 14,000 patients and over 2000 deaths,

261

allocation to aspirin was not associated with reductions in mortality or, among those

262

not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, the risk of progressing to the

263

composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Allocation to aspirin

264

was, however, associated with a small increase in the rate of being discharged from

265

hospital alive within 28 days. These results were consistent across the prespecified

266

subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, duration of symptoms prior to randomisation, level of

267

respiratory support at randomisation, and use of corticosteroids.

Aspirin for COVID-19
268

As expected, allocation to aspirin was associated with an increased risk of major

269

bleeding and a decreased risk of thromboembolic complications, such that for every

270

1000 patients treated with aspirin, approximately 6 more would experience a major

271

bleeding event and approximately 6 fewer would experience a thromboembolic event.

272

The rate of reported thromboembolic events in our study population was low (5.3% in

273

the usual care arm) in comparison with previous reports.1,2 This could be related to the

274

widespread use of corticosteroids in the trial population resulting in reduced thrombo-

275

inflammatory stimulus or because of the exclusion of patients already receiving aspirin

276

because of prior cardiovascular disease. It is possible that aspirin might have a more

277

meaningful benefit in populations with a higher thrombotic risk, although there would

278

also likely be a corresponding increase in bleeding risk.15

279

The pathogenesis of thromboembolism in COVID-19 is likely to be multifactorial.

280

Coagulopathy is common in severe COVID-19 and is associated with an inflammatory

281

state, neutrophil extracellular traps, and poor outcomes. 2,16-20 Platelet activation is

282

increased as a result (and potentially by direct interaction with the virus), amplifying

283

inflammation locally and triggering immunothrombosis.21,22 In addition, SARS-CoV-2

284

infection can cause inflammation, dysfunction, and disruption of the vascular

285

endothelium in multiple organs, potentially via direct entry through the ACE-2

286

receptor.23-25 The resulting endothelial injury and tissue factor exposure promote

287

thrombosis in the pulmonary circulation and other vascular beds, with microangiopathy

288

and alveolar capillary occlusion contributing to the diffuse alveolar damage and

289

hypoxemia seen in COVID-19.24,26 Furthermore, in autopsy studies pulmonary

290

microthrombi are nine times more frequent in patients with COVID-19 compared to

291

patients with influenza.24

Aspirin for COVID-19
292

A large number of randomised controlled trials of antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19

293

are registered, including trials of therapeutic doses of heparin, direct acting oral

294

anticoagulants, anti-platelet agents, serine protease inhibitors, and thrombolytics.27 In

295

critically-ill patients, the INSPIRATION, REMAP-CAP, ACTIV-4a and ATTACC trials

296

did not report a benefit in clinical outcomes from therapeutic anticoagulation.28,29

297

Similarly, preliminary results from the COALIZAO-ACTION trial did not show a benefit

298

from therapeutic anticoagulation (either heparin or rivaroxaban) in a combined

299

endpoint of mortality, successful discharge, or need for oxygen in hospitalised patients

300

with

301

investigators have reported that in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, compared to

302

thromboprophylaxis doses, heparin at therapeutic doses was associated with an

303

absolute increase of 4.6% (95% credible interval 0.7 to 8.1) in the proportion of

304

participants surviving to hospital discharge without receipt of organ support during the

305

first 21 days.31

306

Although there are currently no other published randomised trial data on the use of

307

aspirin in COVID-19, the REMAP-CAP/ACTIV-4a/ATTACC report does suggest that

308

antithrombotic therapy may be important in some patients.31 The lack of meaningful

309

benefit from aspirin in our trial could be because antiplatelet therapy confers no

310

significant additional benefit on top of high rates of antithrombotic therapy with LMWH

311

and

312

Alternatively, other non-platelet pathways leading to thrombosis and alveolar damage

313

may be more important determinants of clinical outcomes.

314

Any potential benefit of antithrombotic therapies in COVID-19 patients may also

315

depend on timing of treatment initiation, especially if thrombi have already developed

Aspirin for COVID-19
316

by the time of admission.32 Thromboembolic events and microthrombi are common in

317

COVID-19 patients on either prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation.33 The

318

apparent lack of benefit in INSPIRATION and the REMAP-CAP/ACTIV-4a/ATTACC

319

severe disease cohorts suggests that these patients might have passed the point at

320

which any benefit from therapeutic anticoagulation could be gained.28,29 Although we

321

found no evidence of heterogeneity based on duration of symptoms, baseline disease

322

severity, or background thrombotic prophylaxis regimen, ongoing trials of aspirin in

323

ambulatory populations and those exploring more potent anti-platelet inhibition and

324

fibrinolysis should provide further insights.

325

Strengths of this trial included that it was randomised, had a large sample size, broad

326

eligibility criteria, and 99% of patients were followed up for the primary outcome. The

327

trial also had some limitations. Detailed information on radiological or physiological

328

outcomes was not collected. Although this randomised trial is open label (i.e.,

329

participants and local hospital staff are aware of the assigned treatment), the primary

330

and secondary outcomes are unambiguous and were ascertained without bias through

331

linkage to routine health records. However, it cannot be excluded that reporting of

332

thromboembolic and bleeding events might have been influenced by knowledge of

333

treatment allocation. Nevertheless, the proportional effects of aspirin on these events

334

were very similar to those reported in previous large clinical trials of aspirin in people

335

with prior cardiovascular disease.6

336

The RECOVERY trial only studied hospitalised COVID-19 patients and, therefore, is

337

not able to provide evidence on the safety and efficacy of aspirin used in other patient

338

groups. Further studies to identify the safety and efficacy of aspirin in non-hospitalised

339

patients are needed and are ongoing.

In summary, the results of this large, randomised trial do not support the addition of

aspirin to standard thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation in patients

hospitalised with COVID-19.

characteristics

545

Subgroup−specific rate ratio estimates are represented by squares (with areas of the

546

squares proportional to the amount of statistical information) and the lines through

547

them correspond to the 95% CIs. The ethnicity, days since onset and use of

548

corticosteroids subgroups exclude those with missing data, but these patients are

549

included in the overall summary diamond.
