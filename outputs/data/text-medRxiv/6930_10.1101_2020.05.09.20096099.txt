Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens to overwhelm the
capacity of the vulnerable healthcare system in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt).
Sufficient training of healthcare workers (HCWs) in how to manage COVID-19 and the provision
of personal protective equipment (PPE) to enable them to do so will be key tools in allowing oPt
to mount a credible response to the crisis.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire. Data
collection occurred between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. The primary outcomes were
availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in oPt for COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary
outcome was the regional and hospital differences in oPt in terms of availability of PPE and
HCWs preparedness.
Results: Of 138 respondents, only 38 HCWs (27.5%) always had access to facemasks when
needed and 15 (10.9%) for isolation gowns. The vast majority of HCWs did not find eye
protection (n=128, 92.8%), N95 respirators (n=132, 95.7%), and face shields (n=127, 92%)
always available. Compared to HCWs in West Bank, those in the Gaza Strip were significantly
less likely to have access to alcohol sanitizers (p=0.026) and gloves (p <0.001). On average,
governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE measures than
non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001). As for preparedness, only 16 (11.6%) surveyed felt
confident in dealing with a potential COVID-19 case. With 57 (41.3%) having received any
COVID-19 related training and 57 (41.3%) not having a local hospital protocol.
Conclusion: HCWs in oPt are underprepared and severely lacking adequate PPE provision. The
lack of local protocols, and training has left HCWs confidence exceedingly low. The lack of PPE
provision will exacerbate spread of COVID-19 and deepen the crisis, whilst putting HCWs at risk.

Keywords: COVID-19, coronavirus, PPE, Palestine, occupied Palestinian territory.

Background
With the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the humanitarian and
healthcare crisis in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) such as the occupied Palestinian
territory (oPt) is expected to be amplified and this will further cripple the healthcare system. As
of May 7, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recorded 547 confirmed cases of
COVID-19 in the oPt; 527 in the West Bank and 20 in the Gaza Strip – with 4 fatalities.1
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) has been unable to support Palestinians’
COVID-19 response needs at their full capacity at the consequence of funding cut and legal
restrictions that were in place prior to the pandemic.2 Multiple COVID-19 testing sites serving
Palestinians in East Jerusalem have been closed by the Israeli authorities.3 The West Bank is
particularly vulnerable due to checkpoint closures, halt of the transportation of patients to
hospitals, and redistribution of clinical supplies. The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely
populated places on earth with 2 million inhabitants, mostly refugees, live in 365 sq. km2,
allowing for an accelerated spread of disease should a COVID-19 outbreak manifest.4 Other
LMICs in the Middle East and Africa have also reported scarcity of personal protective
equipment (PPE) for front line healthcare workers (HCWs).5, 6
We hypothesize that (HCWs) in the oPt are largely underprepared to address COVID-19 related
needs of the Palestinian population in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Shortages of PPE
pose a serious threat to COVID-19 containment in the oPt. It is also expected that HCWs in the
oPt have likely received insufficient training on how to address spread and containment of
COVID-19; institutions themselves may not have yet been equipped to draw up or implement
preventative or management protocols. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no
studies evaluating the preparedness of the HCWs in the oPt to face COVID-19 pandemic. In this
study, we aim to evaluate the availability of PPE and the level of preparedness among the
HCWs in the oPt.
Methods
Study design, setting and data collection
We conducted a cross-sectional study using an online survey tool. Our survey (Additional
material – Table 1) was modified from two validated questionnaires; the first was utilized
during the H1N1 influenza pandemic 7 and the second one was the Personnel, Infrastructure,
Procedures, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES) surgical capacity assessment tool. 8 Our modified
questionnaire consisted of 22 questions divided into 3 different sections (respondent and
healthcare facility characteristics, availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness). Availability of
PPE and HCWs preparedness were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale. The questionnaire was
distributed to HCWs in the oPt through convenient sampling between March 30, 2020 and April
12, 2020. E-mail lists for participants in an educational link (OxPal) and social media (Facebook,
Twitter, and LinkedIn) groups of HCWs in oPt were used to disseminate the
questionnaire. Participants were required to sign in to limit the number of responses to one per
respondent.

Study outcomes
The primary outcomes assessed were availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in oPt in the
era of COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary outcome was to assess the differences between
Gaza Strip and West Bank, and between governmental and non-governmental in oPt in terms of
availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness to face the COVID-19 pandemic.
Statistical analysis
Respondent characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous data,
mean and standard deviation (SD) were used to report normally distributed data, while median
and interquartile ranges (IQR) were used for non-normally distributed data. For categorical
data, results were summarized as counts (n) and percentages (cumulative incidence).
Univariate analysis (chi-squared and Fisher’s Exact tests) was also used to compare participants'
profession, geographical location, and responses to questions related to the availability of PPE
and HCWs preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic. Likert scale variables were converted
from 5-point to binary variables for univariate analysis. For example, often available, sometimes
available, rarely availably and never available were grouped together as ‘not always available’.
Strongly agree and moderately agree were grouped into ‘agree’ variable compared to ‘neutral’
and ‘disagree’ categories. Missing data were considered missing completely at random,
therefore we performed complete case analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using

Results
Of 140 completed surveys, two were excluded from the study as they were either working
outside the oPt or in a non-medical profession.
HCWs and their healthcare facility characteristics
Of 138 HCWs included in the study, 97 respondents (70.3%) were from Gaza Strip and 41
(29.7%) were from the West Bank. The median (IQR) age was 28 (24-35) years with a range
from 19 to 57 years old. 85 respondents (61.6 %) were males. Exactly half of respondents were
medical doctors, with approximately 35 (25.4%) in nursing and the remaining quarter in
physiotherapy, dentistry, or another health-related profession. 20 (14.5%) of the respondents
worked in emergency medicine and 19 (13.8%) in surgery, 14 (10.1%) in primary care and 13
(9.4%) in internal medicine. With regards to place of work, 63 (45.7%) of the respondents
worked in a tertiary hospital, 29 (21%) in a secondary facility and 43 (31%) in a primary
healthcare center or clinic. One respondent worked in a COVID-19 isolation center. 98 (71%)
worked in a governmental institution operated by the Ministry of Health, 26 (18.8%) worked in
a private hospital and 13 (9.4%) in a non-governmental organization (NGO) or mission-based
place of care (Table 1).

Availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in terms of infection control training
Only 67 (48.6%) and 71 (51.4%) of HCWs surveyed indicated that they always had alcohol-based
sanitizer and gloves available in their institutions, respectively. Only 38 (27.5%) of respondents
indicated that regular face masks were always available when needed, and just over 15 (10.9%)
of respondents reported that isolation gowns were always available in their institutions. Over
128 (92.8%), 132 (95.7%), and 127 (92%) of respondents indicated that eye protection, N95
respirators, and face shields were not always available to them at their institutions,
respectively. 57 (41.3%) of HCWs surveyed indicated that their hospital did not provide a local
protocol for the management of COVID-19. Only 57 (41.3%) of respondents had received any
COVID-19 related training courses by the time of survey administration. 16 (11.6%) of HCWs
surveyed agreed with the statement of feeling confident or well-prepared to deal with a
potential COVID-19 case (Table 2).
Univariate analysis comparing Gaza Strip and West Bank in terms of availability of PPE and
HCWs preparedness in terms of infection control training
Compared to the West Bank, respondents from the Gaza Strip reported significantly greater
lack of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (p=0.03) and gloves (p<0.001), but no meaningful
differences were observed between regions on other PPE or infection control readiness (Table
3).
Univariate analysis comparing governmental and non-governmental hospitals in terms of
availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness in terms of infection control training
On average, governmental hospitals run by the MOH were also reported by respondents to be
significantly lacking in sanitizer, gloves, facemasks, eye protection, and face shields compared
to non-governmental institutions (p<0.05) (Table 4).

Discussion
Our study demonstrates that the availability of PPE in both Gaza and the West Bank is
insufficient to support the COVID-19 response needs of the oPt. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers,
gloves, face masks, eye protection, isolation gowns, N95 respirators and face shields were
reported to be inconsistently available, despite being internationally recommended as critical
equipment needed for protecting health care workers from infection.9 Governmental hospitals,
as opposed to non-governmental settings, appear to be particularly lacking in equipment.
Lessons from prior outbreaks have underlined the importance of PPE in infection control.10
Recommendations from the WHO suggest the inadequate supply of infection prevention and
control measures is vital to address immediately, with assistance from international partners if
necessary.11 The WHO specifically mentioned supplies needed to implement recommended
protocols, such as PPE, being a key resource to all national authorities currently not producing
sufficient volumes themselves. Suggestions for other methods of procurement, conservation
and management of PPE have been extensively covered in the literature during the pandemic.12
Many of these suggestions may not be viable in the geopolitical and economic context in which
oPt operates. However, methods such as governmental coordination of all PPE supply,

extending or creating new supply through 3D printing all provide viable means of blunting the
dearth of PPE in oPt currently.13, 14
Our study showed that most HCWs surveyed did not receive adequate training on local protocol
or measures to address COVID-19 spread from an institutional perspective. Comparing the
preparedness of HCWs in oPt to those around the world, will be a vital element of the debrief
from this pandemic and important in developing strategies to ensure the oPt have protocols in
place for future public health crises. The lack of current data makes this comparison impossible,
currently. In previous pandemics, clinicians in other countries have been substantially more
confident in their clinical ability to manage infected patients than what our results reflect; for
example, Chinese ICU HCWs during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were substantially more
confident in their preparedness.15 This may partly be due to a far greater provision of PPE
amongst these workers, that permits greater clinical confidence.
Our study has some important strengths. To our knowledge, this study represents the first
attempt to assess the availability of PPE in oPt and the preparedness of HCWs to face the
COVID-19 pandemic. We provided a comprehensive evaluation of most PPE described in the
literature and used clinically. Participants were well-represented across gender, geographic
region, department/specialty, level of training, profession, and type of health care facility.
Potential limitations of this study include small sample size, which may impact generalizability
to the greater population of Palestinians. Another weakness of our study was the failure to
elicit whether the lack of appropriate PPE was one of the driving factors in reducing HCW
confidence in their preparedness. This would then imply attempts to target increasing PPE
provision could both protect HCW and improve clinical confidence in managing COVID-19
patients. Potential selection bias arises due to sampling method. Most study participants were
recruited from social media posts and emails to the networks of the researchers involved,
which may limit some of the study’s generalizability. However, other studies have
demonstrated the viability of social media recruitment and snowball sampling to access difficult
to reach populations.16 Additionally, participants were asked to report on their individual
experiences and thus may or may not be wholly representative of the institutions in which they
are employed. The cross-sectional nature of this study is also by definition unable to take into
account any changes in equipment or training preparedness over time and is only
representative of the point-in-time data were collected. These limitations were acknowledged
by the authors during study enrolment due to the need to publish findings within the
international community in a time-sensitive manner and address the gap in literature regarding
COVID-19’s unique impact on the population in the oPt.
Conclusions
Low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) are particularly vulnerable to the spread of disease
because they often grapple with detrimental resource and financial constraints that existed
prior to the spread of pandemic. OPt and other LMICs often not only lack proper infrastructure
and resources, but also have to navigate restrictions on movement, travel and transportation of
essential supplies. In this global pandemic, procurement of adequate supply of PPE and the
