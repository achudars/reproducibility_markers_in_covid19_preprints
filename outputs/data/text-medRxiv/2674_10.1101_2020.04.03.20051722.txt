Abstract
Background In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused infectious disease, termed
COVID-19, outbroke in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 patients manifested as lung injury with
complications in other organs, such as liver, heart

，gastrointestinal tract, especially for severe cases.

However, whether COVID-19 causes significant acute kidney injury (AKI) remained controversial.
Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics, urine and blood routine tests and
other laboratory parameters of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Union Hospital.
Findings 178 patients, admitted to Wuhan Union hospital from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were
included in this study. No patient (0 [0%]) presented increased serum creatinine (Scr), and 5 (2.8%)
patients showed increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating few cases with “kidney dysfunction”.

，

However for patients (83) with no history of kidney disease who received routine urine test upon
hospitalization, 45 (54.2%) patients displayed abnormality in urinalysis, such as proteinuria, hematuria
and leukocyturia, while none of the patients was recorded to have acute kidney injury (AKI)
throughout the study. Meanwhile, the patients with abnormal urinalysis usually had worse disease
progression reflecting by laboratory parameters presentations, including markers of liver injury,
inflammation, and coagulation.
Conclusion Many patients manifested by abnormal urinalysis on admission, including proteinuria or
hematuria. Our results revealed that urinalysis is better in unveiling potential kidney impairment of

Introduction
A novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, caused pneumonia outbreak in December 2019 in Wuhan,
China, and quickly spread across the country. Until March 16, 2020, there have been 16,7511
confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 6606 deaths worldwide (announced by WHO). Despite most cases
were from China from the beginning, local outbreak has occurred in other countries recently, such as
Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy. Epidemiological investigations demonstrated that elderly men were
susceptible to the disease and more likely to develop into severe or critically ill stage(1-3). Furthermore,
comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancers, are risk factors for
COVID-19(1, 2). Though most of the COVID-19 patients usually initiated with flu-like symptoms,
some of them underwent rapid deterioration and even die suddenly(4, 5). Emergency measures
including quarantine, traffic control and suspension of public activities are implemented to limit the
epidemic. However, there is no effective treatment against COVID-19 and the presence of
asymptomatic carriers and the possibility of relapse impose additional challenges for COVID-19
prevention(6, 7).

Genomic sequence analysis indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical to bat coronavirus and has
75%-80% similarity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (8-10).
SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as cell entry receptor, thus, patients with
COVID-19 could develop multiple organ or tissue injuries(11-14). It is reported that the patients with
SARS-CoV-2 infection show elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST)

and γglutamyl transferase (GGT), indicating liver and myocardial

damage(1, 3, 15-17). Yet the existence of COVID-19 induced kidney impairment or dysfunction

remain controversial. A recent study reported that 29% of the 52 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia were complicated with acute kidney injury (AKI)(4). Another study among 138
hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 revealed that 5 patients (3.6%) developed AKI and 3
of them ended up in the ICU. Yan et al. demonstrated that among the 59 COVID-19 patients with
kidney impairment, 63% exhibited proteinuria, 19% displayed elevated level of plasma creatinine and
27% showed increased level of urea nitrogen(18). A study from Xu’s group reported that 5.1% (36/701)
patients were identified as AKI(19). In addition, Huang et al revealed that AKI occurred in 7% (3/41)
patients(2). On the contrary, a study with 1099 confirmed COVID-19 cases indicated that only 6
patients (0.5%) developed AKI(17). Another study conducted by Zhou et al revealed that only 4%
(8/186) patients had increased level of Scr(1). Gong et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection could
neither cause obvious AKI nor aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients(20). Thus, as with other
known extrapulmonary organ injury, the existence of AKI deserves to be disclosed in COVID-19
patients, which is pivotal in the disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.

The current study retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 178 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed
patients in Wuhan Union Hospital and proposes to provide additional evidence on the incidence of
kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and address a better indicator for the potential kidney impairment.

Method
Study design
178 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
University of Science and Technology, from February 02 to February 29, 2020, were enrolled in this

retrospective study. All patients in this study were diagnosed according to the guidance (fifth edition)
published by Chinese National Health Commission. The patients with a history of kidney diseases were
excluded from this study, and the flow chart was shown in Figure 1. And the clinical outcomes were
monitored up to February 29, 2020. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Board of
Wuhan Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology
(No. Union Hospital-0093). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the
designated hospital for the emerging infectious diseases.

Data collection
Demographic data, symptoms and vital signs, laboratory examinations were retrieved from electronic
medical records for this study. The laboratory examinations contain blood routine test, blood
biochemical tests (liver function, renal function, lipids and glucose), blood coagulation index,
lymphocyte subsets and cytokines analysis, urine routine test, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte
sedimentation (ESR), serum ferritin (SF), etc. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was
calculated with Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation(21).
Patients were daily assessed the presence of AKI or renal failure using strictly criteria based on the
2011 kidney disease: improved global outcomes (KDIGO) for AKI. All the laboratory measures were
performed at the department of clinical laboratory in Union Hospital and the normal range of these
measures were given by them. The threshold of Scr was 54-133 (μmol/L) for male and 44-106 (μmol/L)
for female, BUN was 2.9-8.2 (mmol/L) , serum uric acid was 208-428 (μmol/L) for male and 155-357
(μmol/L) for female, as well as Cystatin C was 0.63-1.25 (mg/L) for male and 0.54-1.15 (mg/L) for
female. Proteinuria was defined as positive in urine protein (semiquantitative, +-/+/++/+++) and

hematuria was recorded with elevated urine erythrocyte quantification (>17/ul) as well as positive in
semiquantitative urinalysis (+-/+/++/+++). All the parameters were analyzed using extreme values,
except for urinalysis upon first examination on admission due to limited data.

Statistical analysis
The categorical variables were summarized as counts or percentages, and continuous variables were
expressed as mean ± SD or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical
variables were compared using the χ2 test; the Fisher exact test was used when the data were limited.
Continuous variables were compared using independent group t test when the data were normally
distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 20.0 software, and P

＜0.05 was regarded as a significant difference.

Result
COVID-19 patients were seldom diagnosed with AKI
A total of 178 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled in this study,
among which 52 patients were from ICU and 126 patients were from ordinary isolation ward. As
shown in Table 1, the median age of patients in ICU group was 56.5 years (IQR, 40.50-65.5), which
was significantly higher than that of patients in non-ICU group (45, IQR [32.75-57.00]). The
proportion of males in ICU group was higher than that of non-ICU group (61.5% vs. 31.7%). More
patients in ICU group rather than non-ICU group manifested high body temperature (T>38 ) (75% vs.
56.3%). Additionally, some underlying diseases were more common in patients of ICU, such as
hypertension (28.8% vs. 11.1%), diabetes (17.3% vs. 7.9%), cardiovascular insults (13.5% vs. 2.4%),

digestive system (7.7% vs. 4.8%) and respiratory system disease (7.7% vs. 4.8%). These data were
consistent with recent reports related to COVID-19 that elder men with comorbidities are more likely
to be infected and develop into severe cases and even die due to weaker immune function.

Previous studies showed that many patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection usually had increased level of
Scr, BUN and even AKI, especially those severe patients. Unexpectedly, these clinical manifestations,
however, didn’t appear in our data. Patients in both ICU group and non-ICU group displayed normal
Scr and cystatin C level. Of all cases, although 23.6% patients showed decreased estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) compared to normal level, only 2.8% patients were recorded with elevated level
of BUN. Consistent with these results, none of patients develop acute kidney injury or acute renal
failure during whole hospitalization regardless of entry into ICU. Taken together, our data supported
that there was no significant kidney dysfunction among COVID-19 patients.

Potential kidney impairment reflected by routine urine test
Based on the fact that Scr and BUN may not be affected owing to strong compensatory adaption of
kidney, urine examination results were collected to further evaluate the kidney impairment in detail.
Not every COVID-19 patient received regular urine routine test. Only 87 of 178 enrolled patients
underwent urine test on admission, among whom 4 patients were documented with history of kidney
diseases: diabetic nephropathy, kidney stones, multiple renal cystic disease and kidney carcinoma. And
they were excluded in our cohort. The remaining 83 patients were selected for further analysis as
illustrated in Figure 1, with a participation rate of 46.6%. Of the 83 patients, no one reported related
symptoms or was diagnosed as urinary system infection, urethral injury or other urinary system

diseases. Unexpectedly, 54.2% (45/83) patients showed abnormal urine test results, including
proteinuria, hematuria, leukocyturia (Table 2). Specifically, 34.9% cases had positive urine protein,
with 15.7% for “+-”, 16.9% for “+” and 2.4% for “++” (Figure 2A). At the same time, 31.3% patients
presented with hematuria, including 2.4% for “+-”, 16.9% for “+”, 8.4% for “++” and 3.6% for “+++”
(Figure 2A). In addition, the patients in ICU exhibited more severe urinalysis results compared with
non-ICU patients, such as proteinuria (+, 31.6% vs. 12.5%; ++,10.5% vs. 0) and hematuria (+, 26.3%
vs. 18.8%; ++, 21.1% vs. 4.7%; +++, 5.3% vs. 3.1%) (P<0.05 for all) (Figure 2B, C). These results
indicated prevalence of kidney impairment among COVID-19 patients even without significant
changes of filtration function.

Kidney impairment were caused by direct virus invading
Given that proteinuria and hematuria were two prominent signs of kidney impairment, 83 patients were
allocated to groups with abnormal urinalysis (AU) or normal urinalysis (NU) based on urinalysis. It is
also possible that the kidney impairment is due to drug nephrotoxicity. The medications of patients
before admission included antibiotics (Moxifloxacin, Azithromycin, Amoxicillin) (30.1%), antiviral
drugs (Oseltamivir, Lopinavir, Arbidol) (33.8%) and Chinese patent medicine (Lianhuaqingwen
capsule, Isatis root granule) (10.8%). However, there was no statistical difference in prehospital
treatment between AU and NU group (Table 3). This data supported that the kidney impairment was
caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than treatment agents.

Urinalysis abnormality correlates with severity of COVID-19
Subsequently, in order to explore whether urinalysis correlates with disease severity, we compared the
differences in other laboratory parameters between the AU and NU group. Firstly, we found that there

was no difference in eGFR, Scr, BUN and serum uric acid between the two groups. Although the
patients with AU had higher level of cystatin C, all the values were generally within normal range
(Figure 3A). Next, as shown in Figure 3B, the patients in AU group demonstrated remarkably higher
level of liver injury related indicators, such as ALT, AST, GGT, α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase
(HBDH), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP).
And both serum prealbumin level and albumin-globulin ratio (A/G), markers related to liver synthetic
capability and inflammatory state, were lower in AU group than in NU group, indicating possible liver
inflammation. These data revealed that the patients with abnormal urinalysis might be subjected to liver
damage. In addition, the patients in AU group usually presented with higher levels of inflammation
related markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), IL-6, serum
ferritin (SF) and serum amyloid A (SAA) (Figure 3C). However, no significant differences were
observed in major lymphocytes subpopulations, such as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4/CD8, B cells
and NK cells (Figure 3D). What’s more, absolute count of peripheral lymphocyte of AU patients was
significantly lower than that of NU patients, white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils count were
usually higher in patients in AU group (Figure 3E). There was no significant difference between the
two groups in platelet, red blood cells (RBC) and hemoglobin (Figure 3E). As for coagulation profile,
the AU patients had statistically higher levels of serum fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer than NU patients,
indicating the worse coagulation function (Figure 3F). Collectively, these results indicated that the
urinalysis abnormality correlates with severity of COVID-19, and urine routine test may be a good
method for predicting the disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

Here, we described the kidney impairment related manifestations among COVID-19 patients. Our
results suggest kidney impairment are common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, acute
kidney injury occurs infrequently and primary symptoms were abnormal urinalysis, including
proteinuria, hematuria, and leucocyturia. At the same time, urine routine test can be used as a good
method that may be neglected to predict disease severity.

Several papers have demonstrated the renal impairment in COVID-19 patients. However, the
proportion of increased Scr or incidence of AKI after SARS-CoV-2 infection was quite different
among these studies. Some researches supported that SARS-CoV-2 infection cause significant renal
impairment, however, some held an opposite view. We carefully read the relevant articles and found
that the paradox may result from: (1) the difference in severity of illness; (2) the different scale of
patient sampling. Further investigations are urgently needed to provide additional evidence of kidney
impairment in COVID-19 patients.

In the current study, we enrolled 178 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection including 52
cases admitted to ICU and 126 cases not. We found no patient exhibited a rise in Scr or Cystatin C and
occurrence of AKI both in ICU group and non-ICU group. On the contrary, 54.2% (45/83) patients who
performed urine routine tests (48.9% [87/178]) presented abnormal urinalysis, which was featured by
proteinuria, hematuria and leucocyturia. These results reveal that renal impairment are common both in
severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, which is manifested by abnormal urine routine test rather
than elevated level of Scr and AKI. Meanwhile, our study indicates that urinalysis is a better tool to
screen kidney impairment.

These two seemingly opposite results based on blood chemistry analysis and urinalysis respectively
arouse our interest in exploring the underlying reasons. Firstly, although it’s believed that SARS-CoV-2
infection causes kidney impairment, clinical symptoms were not obvious due to the
powerful compensatory function of kidney. It’s well known that serum levels of Scr and BUN will
exceed the normal range only when more than 50% of kidney function has been lost. The extent of
SARS-CoV-2 infection caused kidney impairment may be not enough to result in elevated plasma
markers related renal function. In other words, “kidney impairment” doesn’t lead to “kidney
dysfunction” to a certain extent. Secondly, the primary damage is restricted in renal tubules rather than
glomerulus (Figure 4). Several investigations revealed that SARS-CoV-2 gain entry into host cells by
binding to ACE2 receptor on the host cell surface as the SARS-CoV does. Previous study of ACE2
immunostaining revealed that the mesangium and glomerular endothelium were negative for ACE2 and
the distal tubules and collecting ducts showed weak cytoplasmic staining, whereas abundant staining
was seen in the brush border of proximal tubular cells(22). Another two studies conducted by Xu et al
and Qi’s group pointed that proximal straight tubule cells were potential host cells targeted by
SARS-CoV-2 by scRNA-seq analysis(12, 23). Indeed, such speculation has already been verified by
Diao’s group who reported immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen in kidney specimens of
six perished cases and found that NP expression was restricted in kidney tubules and absent in the
glomerulus. Histopathological examination by H&E staining in kidney specimens has proved acute
tubular necrosis, luminal brush border sloughing and vacuole degeneration(24). Furthermore, another
study on organ distribution of SARS-CoV in patients who died of SARS reported that SARS-CoV was
detected in epithelial cells of distal convoluted renal tubules(25). Meanwhile, the pathological findings

of kidney form autopsy in seven SARS subjects pinpointed that glomerular pathology was not observed
in the kidneys, but acute tubular necrosis of varying degrees was found in all seven renal
specimens(26).

So far, many parameters and models were established to predict the change of condition among
COVID-19 patients. In order to evaluate whether urinalysis is useful to predict the disease severity, we
then divided the patients into two groups based on their results of urine routine test on admission,
named abnormal urinalysis group (AU) and normal urinalysis group (NU). Compared to control
patients, patients in AU group presented no difference in BUN, Scr and eGFR, but had elevated
cystatin C. In addition, we found that patients with abnormal urinalysis usually had more severe
laboratory parameters, such as higher liver and heart injury index, including ALT, AST, ALP, LDH,
HBDH, GGT and LAP, inflammation related markers, including CRP, IL-6, ESR, SAA and serum
ferritin, blood routine indicator including WBC, neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as coagulation
related indicator including FIB and D-dimer. This analysis revealed that the patients with kidney
impairment were generally in worse condition, including multiple organs or tissues injuries (liver,
heart), inflammation and hypercoagulability state, which is probably because of low level of immunity
and high viral load. In addition, our study indicates that urinalysis, a cheap, fast and easy way to
perform, is an excellent method to predict the severe condition of COVID-19 patients.

Admittedly, there are several issues need to be addressed in this study. Firstly, we have no pathological
evidence to confirm our speculation due to lack of specimen from biopsy or autopsy, such as H&E and
immunostaining. Secondly, the dynamic analysis of urinalysis was not performed in COVID-19

patients due to many patients only have one urine routine test on admission. Finally, a larger sample
size should be enrolled in our study. We will attempt to address these questions in our future research.

In summary, we provided the evidence that kidney impairment is common among COVID-19 patients,
and its clinical manifestation is abnormal urinalysis, indicating that urine routine test is a better
indicator to unveil potential kidney impairment than blood chemistry test. Furthermore, our results
suggested that urinalysis is a useful tool to predict disease severity. Thus, we call for front-line
healthcare workers pay more attention on kidney impairment in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection
and routinely monitor urinalysis to judge potential kidney impairment and evaluate disease severity.

Figure 4. Potential mechanisms of kidney impairment in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 can
directly invade renal tubular epithelial cells via ACE2, a virus specific receptor that mainly expressed
in proximal tubular cells, which potentially leading to host cells damage and death. At the same time,
nephrotoxic drugs, hypoxia and infectious caused extensive immune activation, featured by cytokine
storm and immune complex formation, were also factors related to tubular cells impairment. The
impairment caused compromise of tubular integrity may be major reason that the occurrence of
abnormal urinalysis. In addition, although no significant signs of kidney dysfunction and acute kidney
injury, characterized by increased Scr, BUN and cystatin C, many known factors may provoke injury to
the glomeruli, such as inflammation, nephrotoxic drugs and fluid overload.
