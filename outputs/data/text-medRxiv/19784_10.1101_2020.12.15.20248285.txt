Abstract
Italy has been one of the first nations in the world to be heavily affected by the first
wave of COVID-19. To date, it is among the first countries for both total cases of
contagion and deaths. A wide range of containment measures have been adopted
from February to December 2020 to mitigate the pandemic, including total lockdowns
across the entire country. This research sets out to evaluate not only how these
restrictions influenced Italian citizens‚Äô consumption habits (such as online shopping,
smart working and distance learning) but also the impact of lockdowns on the
concentrations of particulate matter (PM) 10 and 2.5 in the Lombardy region. In
particular, this survey is aimed at investigating the environmental sustainability of the
new individual behaviors after the restrictions imposed by the Government in order to
quantify their effects on particulate concentrations in Lombardy, the region most
damaged by both COVID-19 and air pollution. Various tools and online platforms have
been used to collect data, such as Google Trends, web portals providing statistical
and demographic information (e.g. AdminStat Italia and ISTAT, which is the National
Institute of Statistics), surveys conducted by the Department of Civil Protection, other
scientific studies, and the most reliable national newspapers. Technical data on
particulate matter was collected from the website of the Regional Agency for the
Protection of the Environment (ARPA). To highlight any significant change, the
average daily concentrations of PM10 and 2.5 during 2020 in all the provinces of
Lombardy were compared with those of the previous year. The comparison between
the mean values was made through the t-test. Two values were considered as
statistically confident when ùë° < 1.5. However, since the real significance of these
thresholds is not easily determined, some margins of suspicious confidence have been
kept. Finally, using Pearson and Spearman correlations, possible causal correlations
between changes in citizens‚Äô behavior and specific key events related to COVID-19
have been dealt with. The P-value threshold was indicatively set at 0.05. Microsoft
Excel 2020 and Google Sheets were used as data analysis software. In conclusion,
this paper showed a substantial ineffectiveness of total and partial lockdowns in

estimated that COVID-19 has significantly changed the consumption habits of Italian
citizens, thus leading to both positive and negative results in terms of sustainability.
For instance, a sharp rise in the usage of home delivery services is posing a potential
additional threat to the environment at present. At the same time, a positive aspect of
this change is the spread of digital literacy, as Italians got quickly acquainted with the
most modern technologies for distant learning and smart working, thus paving the way
for the establishment of energetically and environmentally sustainable policies
throughout the country.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 disease has raged around the world, radically changing habits and
feelings of global citizens of all ages and statuses, thus causing deep economic and
health crises in all the pandemic stricken-countries (World Health Organization, 20201,
Figueroa et al., 2020, Francisco et al., 2020). Among these, Italy is one of the most
affected: to date (December 5, 2020), it is the sixth nation in the world for number of
deaths from COVID-19, with 1.7 million official cases and 59,000 official deceased
(Worldometers, 2020)2. However, during the first pandemic wave, lots of media,
websites, and environmental protection agencies highlighted a large amount of
beneficial effects of the lockdown on pollution and air quality (FASDA, 2020)3. In this
regard, this research focuses mainly on two aspects: i) the concentrations of
particulate matter pollutants with a diameter ranging from 2.5 Œºm to 10 Œºm (PM10) and
less than 2.5 Œºm (PM2.5) in the Lombardy region, and ii) the increase in the national
demand for home food delivery services, food shopping delivery services, general
shopping delivery services, smart working, and distant learning. In particular, the
purpose of this paper is to quantify the variation in the concentration of PM10 and
PM2.5 as well as evaluate the sustainability of the behaviors adopted by citizens in
response to restrictions on personal freedom, containment measures, and lockdowns
imposed by the government to face the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2. Because of the
multifold aim of this paper, it should be borne in mind that only the Lombardy area was
considered for analyzing the variations of PM10 and PM2.5 quantities. The reasons
for this are that Lombardy has been the most affected region by both COVID-19 and
particulate matter and the deep epidemiological link between the latter and SARSCoV-2 spread (Rovetta and Castaldo, 2020); this makes it suitable for conducting a
reliable investigation and generalizing the results through statistical inference.
Conversely, as far as the behavioral response in citizens is concerned, the whole
Italian nation has been considered since the threat of contagion was perceived
similarly in all regions (Rovetta and Castaldo, 2020). To do this, Google Trends - an
online tool provided by Google‚Ñ¢- was used as it allows users to search for any query

and visualize and quantify the trend over time of the web interest in it in any region of
the world. This infoveillance tool is being increasingly exploited by the scientific
community for investigating users‚Äô behavior and creating predictive models (Jimenez
et al., 2020).

2. Methods
2.1 Data collection
Google Trends4 has been used to explore Italian citizens‚Äô web interest in home food
delivery services, food shopping services, shopping services, and smart working
software and online learning platforms, during and after the first COVID-19 restrictions
and containment measures. Google Trends is a web tool which provides normalized
values, called ‚Äúrelative search volumes (RSV)‚Äù, ranging from 0 (very low relative
interest) to 100 (very high relative interest). All the search parameters and queries are
shown in Table 1. PM10 and 2.5 daily averages data were collected from all the
measuring stations of every province of Lombardy. To do that, the Regional Agency
for Environmental Protection (ARPA) official website5 was used. Data on COVID-19
cases and deaths was collected from the Department of Civil Protection official
website6. Meteorological data was collected from the website "Il Meteo.it"7.

2.2 Statistical Analysis
This paper quantifies the impact of COVID-19 restrictions and containment measures
on the web queries RSVs and average concentrations of PM10 and 2.5 through the
percentage increases ùõ•% = (ùë•1 ‚àí ùë•0 )/ùë•0 ‚ãÖ 100 and their related t-test ùë° = (ùë•1 ‚àí ùë•0 )/ùúé.
All statistical errors ùúé were calculated with the standard propagation formula (Taylor,
1997). Each mean value ùë• was reported together with its own standard error of the
mean (ùëÜùê∏ùëÄ) according to the following modality: ùë• ¬± ùëÜùê∏ùëÄ (Taylor, 1997). Data
normality was verified both with the z-tests ùëò/ùúéùëò < 2 and ùë†/ùúéùë† < 2 for kurtosis ùëò and
skewness ùë† and graphically (Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996). For doubtful cases (2 <
ùëß < 1.5), we also used the Shapiro-Wilk test. When the number of measures ùëõ was
greater than 30, the central limit theorem has been used to validate the t-test when
dealing with not normally distributed data (Kwak and Kim, 2017).
2.2.1 Google Trends
We compared the weekly web query trends of 2020 with those of 2019 and 2018,
searching for significant discrepancies and focusing on pre-lockdown and the first
lockdown period (from 20 February to 18 May 2020). When 2018 and 2019 data series
were periodic or stationary, the trends of 2020 queries were compared to those of the
previous two years. When 2018 and 2019 data series were aperiodic and nonstationary, anomalous peaks of RSV were highlighted8. Two mean values were
considered confident only when ùë° < 1.5 and not confident only when ùë° ‚â• 1.9, whereas
in the intermediate 1.5 ‚â§ ùë° < 1.9 range non-confidence was interpreted as suspicious.
Pearson and Spearman correlations were searched between RSVs and COVID-19
total cases and deaths. The possible causal nature of these relationships was tested
by researching the same correlations between the 2019 RSVs and the COVID-19 total
cases and deaths during 2020. In order to highlight any hidden correlation, Pearson
and Spearman coefficients were used together (Rovetta, 2020). The chosen P-value
significance threshold was ùõº = .05; however, all correlations with .05 < ùëÉ < .1 were
classified as suspicious (Amrhein et al., 2017).
2.2.2 PM10 and 2.5
We compared the average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 during 2020 with those
of 2019, searching for significant discrepancies and focusing on the first lockdown
(period 1: from March 9 to May 18, 2020) and during 2020 (period 2: January 1 to
November 19, 2020). Two mean values were considered confident only when ùë° < 1.5
and not confident only when ùë° ‚â• 1.9; in the intermediate 1.5 ‚â§ ùë° < 1.9 range, nonconfidence was interpreted as suspicious. Meteorological data - such as minimum,
maximum, and average temperatures, % relative humidity, and maximum wind speedwere analyzed according to the same criteria and considering the same timespans.
Furthermore, the number of inhabitants and surface area of each province were also
8

Anomalous peaks are defined as upward trends possibly related to lockdowns or other key events
as these were not present in the previous two years trends.

reported in the results section, so as to exemplify the coverage of territory of the
measuring stations and the demographic importance of all provinces. These data were
taken from the official websites of National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) 9 and
AdminStat10.

3. Results
Substantial weather changes were identified in Lombardy between 2019 and 2020. In
particular, significant or suspected decreases in the maximum wind speed occurred in
100% of cases during period 1 (ùõ•ùëéùë£ % = ‚àí18.0 ¬± 3.3) and in 66.7% of cases during
period 2 (ùõ•ùëéùë£ % = ‚àí9.2 ¬± 1.1). In table 1, the t-test results between the
meteorological quantities of 2019 and 2020 in 9 of the 12 provinces of Lombardy are
shown.

During period 1 (i.e. the comparison between the periods 9 March - 18 May 2020 and
2019), significant or suspected increases in the mean concentrations of PM10 and 2.5
were observed in 57% of cases (53/93); significant or suspected reductions occurred
only in 3.2% of cases (3/93). In the remaining 39.8% of cases, no significant or
suspected changes were observed (37/93). During period 2 (i.e. the comparison
between the period 1 January - 19 November, 2020 and 2019), significant or
suspected increases in the mean concentrations of PM10 and 2.5 were observed in
20.4% of cases (19/93); significant or suspected reductions occurred only in 6.4% of
cases (6/93). In the remaining 73.2% of cases, no significant or suspected changes
were found (68/93).
3.1.1 Province of Bergamo
The province of Bergamo has about 1.108 million inhabitants and extends for 2,755
km¬≤. In this area, there are 13 measuring stations: 8 for PM10 and 5 for PM2.5. During
period 1, 3 significant changes were observed for the average concentrations of PM10
(ùõ•1 % = +20.0 ¬± 11.0, ùë°1 = 2.1; ùõ•2 % = +28.8 ¬± 11.7, ùë°2 = 2.7; ùõ•3 % = 19.0 ¬±
10.4, ùë°3 = 2.1) and 2 worth-noticing variations in the average concentrations of
PM2.5
(ùõ•4 % = +36.5 ¬± 12.7, ùë°4 = 3.5; ùõ•5 = +23.6 ¬± 10.8, ùë°5 = 2.5).
2
suspected cases for PM10 and 1 for PM2.5 were also observed (ùõ•6 % = +16.4 ¬±
9.7, ùë°6 = 1.8; ùõ•7 % = +14.8 ¬± 8.6, ùë°7 = 1.7; ùõ•8 % = +15.2 ¬± 11.1,
ùë°8 = 1.5).
Therefore, the first lockdown did not cause any significant changes in PM
concentrations in 38.5% of cases and caused significant or suspected increases in
61.5% of cases. Considering period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause
significant changes in PM concentrations in 92.3% of cases; only 1 significant change
was observed for PM10 (ùõ•9 % = ‚àí13.3 ¬± 5.3, ùë°9 = 2.4).
3.1.2 Province of Brescia
The province of Brescia has about 1.264 million inhabitants and extends for 4,786 km¬≤.
In this area, there are 9 measuring stations: 6 for PM10 and 3 for PM2.5. Only 1
significant change in PM10 average concentration was observed during period 1
(ùõ•% = +23.1 ¬± 10.5 , ùë° = 2.4). During period 2, 1 significant change in average
PM2.5 concentration (ùõ•1 % = ‚àí10.5 ¬± 5.5, ùë°1 = 2.3) and 1 suspected change in
average PM10 concentration (ùõ•2 % = ‚àí7.5 ¬± 5.7, ùë°2 = 1.5) were observed.
Therefore, the first lockdown did not cause significant changes in PM concentrations
in 88.9% of cases and caused significant increases in 11.1% of cases. Considering
period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause significant changes in PM
concentrations in 77.8% of cases and caused significant or suspected decreases in
22.2% of cases.
3.1.3 Province of Como
The province of Como has about 600,000 inhabitants and extends for 1,279 km¬≤. In
this area, there are 4 measuring stations: 3 for PM10 and 1 for PM2.5. During period

average PM2.5 concentrations was also found (ùõ•3 % = +11.8 ¬± 6.6, ùë°3 = 1.7). No
significant nor suspected changes in PM10 or 2.5 concentrations were observed
during period 2. Therefore, the first lockdown did not cause significant changes in PM
concentrations in 25.0% of cases and caused significant or suspected increases in PM
concentrations in 75.0% of cases. Considering period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did
not cause significant changes in PM concentrations.
3.1.4 Province of Cremona
The province of Cremona has about 360,000 inhabitants and extends for 1,770 km¬≤.
In this area, there are 10 measuring stations: 6 for PM10 and 4 for PM2.5. During
period 1, 3 significant changes were observed for average concentrations of PM10
(ùõ•1 % = +33.7 ¬± 12.2, ùë°1 = 3.3; ùõ•2 % = +17.1 ¬± 7.6, ùë°2 = 2.0; ùõ•3 % = 16.2 ¬±
7.8, ùë°3 = 1.9) and 1 for average concentrations of PM2.5 (ùõ•4 = +28.6 ¬± 7.3, ùë°4 =
3.4). 2 suspected cases for PM10 and 1 for PM2.5 were also observed (ùõ•5 % =
+12.7 ¬± 8.0, ùë°5 = 1.8; ùõ•6 % = +14.2 ¬± 8.3, ùë°6 = 1.6; ùõ•7 % = +12.6 ¬± 7.7, ùë°7 =
1.5). During period 2, only 1 significant change in average PM2.5 concentrations has
been observed (ùõ•1 % = +12.9 ¬± 5.6, ùë°1 = 2.2). Therefore, the first lockdown did not
cause significant changes in PM concentrations in 30.0% of cases and caused
significant or suspected increases in PM concentrations in 70.0% of cases.
Considering period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause significant changes in
PM concentrations in 90.0% of cases and caused significant increases in 10.0% of
cases.
3.1.5 Province of Lecco
The province of Lecco has about 340,000 inhabitants and extends for 806 km¬≤. Here
there are 8 measuring stations: 5 for PM10 and 3 for PM2.5. During period 1, 3
significant changes were observed for average concentrations of PM10 (ùõ•1 % =
+46.3 ¬± 6.5, ùë°1 = 3.9; ùõ•2 % = +27.9 ¬± 7.6, ùë°2 = 2.6; ùõ•3 % = 34.6 ¬± 6.3, ùë°3 =

2.6; ùõ•5 % = +29.1 ¬± 8.0, ùë°5 = 2.5). During period 2, 2 significant changes in average
PM10 concentrations (ùõ•1 % = +11.0 ¬± 4.9, ùë°1 = 1.9; ùõ•2 % = ‚àí18.2 ¬± 7.1, ùë°2 =
3.5) and 1 for PM2.5 (ùõ•2 % = ‚àí13.1 ¬± 6.6, ùë°2 = 2.5) were observed. 1 suspected
change was also found (ùõ•3 % = +9.5 ¬± 5.2, ùë°3 = 1.6). Therefore, the first lockdown
caused no significant changes in PM concentrations in 37.5% of cases and significant
or suspected increases in PM concentrations in 62.5% of cases. As regards period 2,
all COVID-19 restrictions caused no significant changes in PM concentrations in
50.0% of cases, significant decreases in 25.0% of cases, and significant or suspected
increases in the remaining 25.0%.

this area, there are 13 measuring stations: 9 for PM10 and 4 for PM2.5. During period
1, 5 significant and 1 suspected changes were observed for average concentrations
of PM10 (ùõ•1 % = +28.4 ¬± 7.8, ùë°1 = 2.5; ùõ•2 % = +25.2 ¬± 8.1, ùë°2 = 2.1; ùõ•3 % =

2.3; ùõ•6 % = +22.6 ¬± 9.1, ùë°6 = 1.8). During period 2, 1 significant and 2 suspected
changes in PM10 concentrations were recorded (ùõ•1 % = +13.9 ¬± 4.6, ùë°1 = 2.5;
ùõ•2 % = +8.2 ¬± 4.6, ùë°2 = 1.6, ùõ•3 % = 10.1 ¬± 4.8 , ùë°3 = 1.8). Therefore, the first
lockdown did not cause significant changes in PM concentrations in 53.8% of cases
and caused significant or suspected increases in the remaining 46.2%. As regards
period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause significant changes in PM
concentrations in 84.6% of cases and caused significant or suspected increases in the
remaining 15.4%.

PM2.5 (ùõ•5 % = +18.0 ¬± 7.6, ùë°5 = 2.5); 1 suspected change in average PM10
concentrations were also recorded (ùõ•6 % = +8.3 ¬± 5.7, ùë°6 = 1.5). Therefore, the first
lockdown did not cause significant changes in PM concentrations in 53.8% of cases,
and caused significant increases in 30.8% of cases and significant decreases in 15.4%
of cases. As regards period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause significant

The province of Monza e Brianza has about 872,000 inhabitants and extends for 406
km¬≤. In this area, there are 4 measuring stations: 3 for PM10 and 1 for PM2.5. During
period 1, 3 significant changes for average concentrations of PM10 (ùõ•1 % = +15.7 ¬±
7.3, ùë°1 = 1.9; ùõ•2 % = +28.0 ¬± 7.2, ùë°2 = 3.0; ùõ•3 % = 20.5 ¬± 6.8, ùë°3 = 2.8) and 1
for average concentrations of PM2.5 (ùõ•4 % = +33.0 ¬± 7.2, ùë°4 = 3.3) were

PM2.5 (ùõ•2 % = +10.0 ¬± 5.2, ùë°2 = 1.8) were recorded. Therefore, the first lockdown
caused significant increases in PM concentrations in 100.0% of cases. As regards
period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause significant changes in PM
concentrations in 50.0% of cases and caused significant or suspected increases in the
remaining 50.0%.

6.4, ùë°3 = 1.5; ùõ•4 % = +12.2 ¬± 6.6, ùë°4 = 1.5). Therefore, the first lockdown caused
significant or suspected increases in PM concentrations in 72.7% of cases, suspected
decreases in 9.1% of cases, and no significant or suspected changes in 18.2% of
cases. As regards period 2, all COVID-19 restrictions did not cause significant
changes in PM concentrations in 63.6% of cases, and caused significant or suspected
increases in 27.3% of cases and suspected decreases in the remaining 9.1%.

1.7). During period 2, no significant or suspected changes were recorded. Therefore,
the first lockdown caused significant increases in PM concentrations in 83.3% of cases
and no significant changes in the remaining 16.7%. As regards period 2, no significant
or suspected changes were observed.
3.1.12 Province of Varese
The province of Sondrio has about 890,000 inhabitants and extends for 1,198 km¬≤. In
this area, there are 6 measuring stations: 4 for PM10 and 2 for PM2.5. During period
1, 1 significant change in average concentrations of PM10 (ùõ•1 % = +21.6 ¬± 7.6, ùë°1 =
2.1) and 1 in average concentrations of PM2.5 (ùõ•2 % = +27.9 ¬± 7.9, ùë°2 = 2.4) were
observed. During period 2, only 1 suspected change in average PM2.5 concentrations
was found (ùõ•1 % = +11.9 ¬± 6.4, ùë°1 = 1.7). Therefore, the first lockdown did not
cause significant changes in PM concentrations in 66.7% of cases and caused

3.2 Consumer behavior
3.2.1 Home food delivery services
Italian citizens‚Äô web interest in home food delivery services showed seasonality during
2018 and 2019 (Figure 1). During the first lockdown and pre-lockdown (20 February 18 May, 2020), the queries "just eat, uber eats, deliveroo, foodracers and glovo"
recorded a significant percentage increase if compared with the same period in 2019
(ùõ•1 % = +30.6 ¬± 6.5, ùë°1 = 4.8;
ùõ•2 % = +80.7 ¬± 58.0, ùë°2 = 2.9; ùõ•3 % = +38.7 ¬±
25.1, ùë°3 = 5.8; ùõ•4 % = +269.2 ¬± 60.5, ùë°4 = 5.2; ùõ•5 % = +173.0 ¬± 44.8, ùë°5 = 8.3).
It must be pointed out that three of these queries (uber eats, deliveroo, and glovo) had
already undergone a significant increase between 2018 and 2019. However, the
highest RSV peak detected in spring 2020, during the first lockdown, was not present
in 2018 and 2019 series (Figure 1). Moreover, such trends have also been heavily
influenced in the months following the first wave of COVID-19 (Figure 1). Significant
correlations were observed between RSVs and COVID-19 total cases and total deaths
(ùëü1 = .78, ùëÉ < .0001; ùëü2 = .72, ùëÉ = .0003); nevertheless, such correlations were also
identified between the same web queries during 2019 and COVID-19 total cases and
deaths.

3.2.2 Online food shopping services and online supermarkets
The web interest of Italian citizens in food shopping services and online supermarkets
underwent a significant percentage increase during the first lockdown compared to the
same trend during 2018 and 2019 (Figure 2). Indeed, the following queries including
names of some of the commonest Italian supermarket chains (i.e. carrefour online,
conad online, iperal online, esselunga online) alongside more general ones about
online food shopping (i.e. spesa online + supermercato online + supermercati online)
recorded the following percentage increases: ùõ•1 % =
+861.9 ¬± 293.8, ùë°1 =
3.4; ùõ•2 % = +2593.8 ¬± 725.9, ùë°2 = 3.4; ùõ•3 % = +1100.0 ¬± 324.6, ùë°3 = 2.9;
ùõ•4 % = +1358.3 ¬± 450.4, ùë°4 = 2.9; ùõ•5 % = +184.6 ¬± 65.4, ùë°5 = 3.4.
Moreover,
the interest in these queries remained relatively high during the rest of 2020 compared
to those of the previous two years, growing again with the arrival of the second period
of restrictions (Figure 2). Significant hidden correlations were observed between RSVs
and COVID-19 total cases and deaths (ùëÖ1 = .49, ùëÉ < .035; ùëÖ2 = .46, ùëÉ = .049);
nevertheless, such correlations were also identified between the same web queries
during 2019 and COVID-19 total cases and deaths.

3.2.3 Online shopping
The web interest of Italian citizens in home delivery services showed seasonality
during 2018 and 2019 (Figure 3). During the pre-lockdown and first lockdown (20
February - 18 May, 2020), the query "amazon" recorded a significant percentage
increase if compared with the same period in 2019 (ùõ•% = +22.1 ¬± 4.0, ùë° = 6.2).
This increase continued throughout the spring and early summer to varying degrees
(Figure 3). The query "ebay" also underwent an anomalous rise during the first
lockdown period, reaching the annual RSV peak despite what happened in 2018 and
2019 (Figure 3). Only low and non significant correlations were identified between
such queries and COVID-19 total cases and deaths (ùëÖ, ùëü < 0.3, ùëÉ > .23).
3.2.4 Smart working and distance learning
The web interest of Italian citizens in smart working and distance learning platforms
such as Google Classroom, Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and Skype, underwent a
drastic surge during and after the first lockdown (ùõ•% = + 1190.8 ¬± 133.3, ùë° = 8.8
during period 1 and ùõ•% = + 632.7 ¬± 78.8, ùë° = 8.2 during period 2). Among all
regions, Calabria is the one that has shown the highest interest in these technologies
with an ùëÖùëÜùëâ = 100. The other regions had an ùëÖùëÜùëâ in the interval [35, 50] i.e. they
showed a more similar interest (ùëÜùê∑ 4.3).

4. Discussion
Several studies have been conducted on the impact of the lockdown on Lombardy's
air quality (Cameletti, 2020, Piccoli et al., 2020, Putaud et al., 2020, and Collivignarelli
et al., 2020). However, not all results are fully concordant: in fact, while Putaud et al.
claim that they have not observed any significant change in PM10 concentrations in
Milan, Collivignarelli et al. argue that the lockdown had a positive effect on them, as
well as on PM2.5 and other air pollutants. In this context, Cameletti highlights how a
reduction in particulate matter emissions does not necessarily imply a reduction in its
concentrations, underlining the complexity in the analysis of these types of
phenomena. Such evidence could help explain the discrepancy found between
previous authors and between the various reports from environmental protection
agencies and universities. Another point to be taken into account is that these
differences could also be explained by the different approaches adopted in the
aforementioned studies, since some have used predictive models inherent exclusively
to 2020 while others have compared the concentrations of pollution in the current year
with those of previous years. This paper falls into the second category, as it
investigates the differences in average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 between
specific periods during 2019 and 2020. Piccoli et al. showed that, as Milan registered
similar temperatures during February and March in both 2019 and 2020, such data
are suitable for a comparative analysis. This supports the assumption of the absence
of unusual weather regimes. However, an evident reduction in wind speed was
highlighted in this paper which certainly contributed to the increase in concentrations
of particulate matter across the Lombardy region. Moreover, non-uniform and

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.20248285; this version posted December 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this

significant variations in temperature and relative humidity may have further biased the
estimate of particulate matter emissions in an unpredictable manner. Nonetheless, the
most important result of this paper is that even a total lockdown strategy would be
absolutely insufficient to reduce the concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in a
sustainable way. Similar results were found by Donzelli et al. in Tuscany (Donzelli et
al., 2020). This again calls into question the role of motor vehicles in the production of
this type of air pollution. Abu-Allaban et al. showed that the fractional contributions of
motor vehicles to ambient PM in urban areas in the USA were in the ranges 20-76%
and 35-92% for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively. The Italian National Research Council
(CNR)11 measured a reduction in road traffic of 48-60% in Italian cities which was
obviously not followed by an equal reduction in particulates, thus confirming the great
variance of the above ranges. Therefore, this research suggests that industries,
private routinary activities, and ambiental factors, could contribute very significantly to
air pollution in Lombardy. Moreover, the demand for online delivery and shopping
services has dramatically increased both during and after lockdowns. All of these ecommerce services- including Amazon- can have a very negative environmental
impact, especially when providing fast delivery times: indeed, not only the emissions
of the transport vehicles but also the plastic packaging widely used by the companies
do contribute to environmental pollution12,13 (CNN, 2019, SCSC, 2019). In this regard,
Amazon claims to be planning a sustainable delivery strategy14 (Amazon, 2020):
considering the current condition, it is high time the company was faithful to its words.
Furthermore, it would be advisable that states and organizations all over the world
impose more stringent and effective criteria for monitoring the individuals‚Äô
environmental impact, as far as their administrative policies are concerned. Another
aspect to be considered is that Google Trends has proved to be an effective
infoveillance tool for this type of scientific survey, since the growing web interest in
food delivery services has been met by a real increase in the orders actually placed
by Italian users (AGI, 2020)15. Finally, smart working and distance learning could be
very valid alternatives in terms of environmental impact as they do not involve
travelling or excessive use of materials such as textbooks, notepads, notebooks,
chalks, markers, etc. Conversely, this leads to an increase in household consumption
of electricity and heat, especially during the winter. Nonetheless, it should be taken
into account that such consumptions were inevitable even when people work in their
own work structures and private houses in Italy do not often have the same energy
class systems (ABC Costruzioni, 2018). Moreover, there are many challenges to be
faced before taking this path (The Planet Mark, 2016, Hodder, 2020, Sarti et al., 2020)
and the effectiveness of online lessons is still a hotly-debated topic among parents,
teachers and psychologists (Daniel, 2020, Mukhtar et al., 2020, Abbasi et al., 2020,
Abuhammad, 2020). What is certain is that the population has had to forcibly learn to

use some of the most modern technologies and techniques of file sharing, databases,
and online communication software and tools; thus, in the future, it will be easier and
less impacting at an emotional-psychological level to insert smart working and online
learning methods in everyday life, once the right compromise between the
psychosocial health safeguard and environmental protection will be reached. Finally,
the correlations found between COVID-19 cases and deaths, and web searches
related to home delivery services in 2019 and 2020, could prove how the virus has
spread easier in regions with more frequent trade relations.
4.1 Strengths and limitations
As far as the author knows, this is the first study that compares PM10 and PM2.5
concentrations during 2019 and 2020 in Lombardy including data from all the
measuring stations of all its provinces also quantifying their meteorological differences.
Furthermore, this study demonstrates a substantial reliability of Google Trends in
estimating the demand for e-commerce and home delivery services of Italian web
users as well as the ineffectiveness of lockdowns in the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5
concentrations in the most populated Italian region. However, some limitations must
be considered: the search for statistical correlations cannot provide details on any
possible causal nature of the phenomena investigated. The web interest of Google
users is not certain to reflect the general interest of all Italian citizens. In some
provinces, the number of measuring stations could be insufficient to represent in detail
the overall trend of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. Finally, some weather
differences may have biased the comparison between the particulate emissions during
2019 and 2020.

5. Conclusions
This study shows that even a forced total lockdown strategy, capable of reducing road
traffic in Italian cities by 48-60%, was absolutely insufficient to reduce the
concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in the Lombardy region. Environmental factors,
industries, and individual routinary activities, can therefore have non-marginal or even
preponderant roles in the production of this type of pollution. At the same time, COVID19 has shown that citizens and the government are not yet ready to manage policies
that support smart working or distance learning. Furthermore, the increase in demand
for home delivery services and online shopping during and after the lockdowns must
draw further attention from government authorities on the environmental issue. In
conclusion, we can state that COVID-19 has drastically changed various habits of
Italian citizens. Among the positive aspects of this change there was the learning of
new technological methods and tools for online collaboration and remote
communication via the Internet. This can be a starting point for the integration of
policies aimed at preserving both the mental and physical health of citizens and the
environment on which they depend.
