Summary

21

Background

22

Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with the severe acute respiratory

23

coronavirus 2019 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Between 12 March 2020 and 10 January 2021, >1,170

24

HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic medical institution in the Upper

25

Midwest of the United States. We aimed to understand the sources of infections in HCP and to

26

evaluate the efficacy of infection control procedures used at this institution to protect HCP from

27

healthcare-associated transmission.

28
29

Methods

30

In this retrospective case series, we used viral genomics to investigate the likely source of

31

SARS-CoV-2 infection in 96 HCP where epidemiological data alone could not be used to rule

32

out healthcare-associated transmission. We obtained limited epidemiological data through

33

informal interviews and review of the electronic health record. We combined viral sequence data

34

and available epidemiological information to infer the most likely source of HCP infection.

35
36

Findings

37

We investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible patient

38

contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). Of these, 182 sequences met quality

39

standards and were used for downstream analysis. We found the majority of HCP infections

40

could not be linked to a patient or co-worker and therefore likely occurred in the outside

41

community (58/96; 60.4%). We found a smaller percentage could be traced to a coworker

42

(10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly, the

43

smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96; 4.2%).

44
45

Interpretation

46

Infection control procedures, consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for

47

COVID-19 patients in a representative American academic medical institution. Rapid SARS-

48

CoV-2 genome sequencing in healthcare settings can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the

49

likely source of HCP infection when epidemiological data are not available or are inconclusive.

50

Understanding the source of SARS-CoV-2 infection can then be used prospectively to adjust

51

and improve infection control practices and guidelines.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

60

On 16 January 2021 we searched for “SARS-CoV-2” AND “healthcare workers” AND “viral

61

sequencing” in Google Scholar. This search returned 57 results, and included a number of

62

preprint articles. We found two studies that used viral sequencing to investigate healthcare-

63

associated outbreaks in the Netherlands 1 and the United Kingdom 2. To our knowledge, no

64

study has used viral sequencing to specifically investigate the source of SARS-CoV-2 infections

65

in healthcare workers in the United States. Although we and others have written about the

66

potential utility of sequencing as an infection control asset 3–6, few have demonstrated the

67

practical application of such efforts.

68
69

Added value of this study

70

Our study suggests infection control measures in place at the institution evaluated in this case

71

series are largely protecting healthcare personnel (HCP) from healthcare-associated SARS-

72

CoV-2 infections. Even so, the majority of healthcare-associated infections we did identify

73

appeared to be linked to HCP-to-HCP spread so additional messaging and guidelines to reduce

74

HCP-to-HCP spread in and out of the workplace may be warranted. In addition, we

75

demonstrated how rapid viral sequencing can be combined with, even limited, epidemiological

76

information to reconstruct healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

77
78

Implications of all the available evidence

79

Healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections negatively affect HCP, patients, and

80

communities. Infections among HCP add further strain to the healthcare system and put

81

patients and other HCP at risk. We found the majority of HCP infections appeared to be

82

acquired through community exposure so measures to reduce community spread are critical.

83

This further emphasizes the importance of mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing

84

programs, and the rapid distribution of vaccines.

Introduction

86

Despite the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other strategies to mitigate risk,

87

front-line healthcare workers are at increased risk for infection with severe acute respiratory

88

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) compared to the general population 7. Healthcare-

89

associated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 poses a serious risk to healthcare workers as well as

90

to other hospital staff and patients 8,9. Here we use rapid viral sequencing and forensic

91

genomics to uncover the likely source of infection in 96 confirmed cases of coronavirus-disease

92

2019 (COVID-19) in healthcare personnel (HCP). We further describe how the results of these

93

investigations informed infection control recommendations within a large academic medical

94

system in the midwestern United States.

95
96

Healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 infections negatively affect HCP through direct health

97

impacts, lost wages, and secondary consequences for their close contacts 10. Healthcare-

98

associated SARS-CoV-2 infections can also negatively impact patient care through staffing

99

shortages, environmental contamination, low morale and other mental health impacts on HCP;

100

each of these can secondarily impact the overall quality of care 2,11.

101
102

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have released guidelines for

103

infection prevention for HCP interacting directly with patients with suspected or confirmed

104

infection with SARS-COV-2 12. These guidelines include recommendations for the proper use of

105

PPE, hand hygiene, precautions to be taken during aerosol-generating procedures, collection of

106

diagnostic respiratory specimens, environmental infection control practices and many others.

107

These guidelines in addition to institution-specific infection control measures – described in

108

detail in Lepak et al 13 – were in place at the institution evaluated here. We posit that these

109

guidelines are generally successful in protecting HCP from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a

110

healthcare setting. In this report, we test this hypothesis using viral sequencing to investigate

111

the likely sources of infection in a series of HCP in the United States.

112
113

Sequencing has been used to explore the origin and the path of spread of various nosocomial

114

bacterial pathogens, such as vancomycin resistant-enterococcus (VRE), Listeria

115

monocytogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 14–17. With a few exceptions 18–20, viral sequencing

116

is not currently standard practice for investigating healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2

117

infections, although we and others have highlighted the potential utility of this approach 3–6. Data

118

suggest SARS-CoV-2 accumulates approximately one fixed mutation every other transmission

119

event 21,22. Therefore, if SARS-CoV-2 is directly transmitted from one individual to another, this

120

“transmission pair” is expected to share identical, or nearly identical (≤1 consensus SNV

121

difference), viral sequences. The most parsimonious explanation for identical or near-identical

122

genomes generated from individuals with known contact is that they are transmission pairs 23. In

123

contrast, two people who became infected at similar times, but from different sources, would be

124

expected to be infected with viruses that differ from each other by two or more nucleotides. This

125

is especially true at this stage of the pandemic in the United States, when transmission rates are

126

high and multiple viruses of distinct genetic lineages cocirculate in many areas 24. By increasing

127

the resolution of inference, rapid viral sequencing can facilitate a targeted approach to examine

128

SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial outbreaks at the level of the individual and the institution, which others

129

have referred to collectively as “precision epidemiology” 25.

130

Results

131

HCP began testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a major academic biomedical institution in the

132

American Upper Midwest in early March 2020. From 12 March, 2020 to 10 January, 2021

133

~1,172 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at this center. In collaboration with this institution’s

134

infection control team, we began sequencing viral genomes from residual nasopharyngeal

135

specimens from the individuals involved in these infection clusters. We focused our analyses on

136

HCP infections and infection clusters that were highest risk for nosocomial transmission, as

137

when healthcare-associated transmission could not be ruled out using epidemiological data

138

alone. Each investigation included at least one HCP, all known direct and indirect SARS-CoV-2-

139

positive patient contacts where residual swab was available, and occasionally extended to

140

epidemiologically-linked household contacts. Relevant patient contacts were identified in the

141

Epic electronic medical record using a comprehensive caregiver trace. This function identifies all

142

patient records accessed by a HCP.

143
144

We consider three main potential sources of healthcare-associated infection with SARS-CoV-2:

145

“outside community,” “patient source” (via HCP-patient interactions), and “employee source” (via

146

HCP-HCP interactions). A few HCP infections did not fit neatly into these categories so we have

147

included two additional categories. First, “combined patient and employee cluster”, where a

148

patient-to-HCP transmission event likely initiated a cluster of infections, but we were unable to

149

pinpoint the first HCP to become infected. Second, “inconclusive”, where a consensus

150

sequence was not available, there were no appropriate comparator samples, or epidemiological

151

information were insufficient to interpret the sequence data.

152
153

For us to conclude person A was a likely source of infection for person B, persons A and B must

154

have had known contact with each other, must have been tested within 0-14 days of each other,

155

and must have been infected with identical or near-identical (≤1 consensus intrahost single

156

nucleotide variant (iSNV) difference) viruses. In cases where we found the HCP virus diverged

157

from the patient- and employee-contact viruses, we concluded infection most likely occurred

158

outside of the healthcare setting, or in the “outside community”.

160

In total, we investigated 32 SARS-CoV-2 infection clusters involving 96 HCP, 140 possible

161

patient contacts, and 1 household contact (total n = 237). This accounted for approximately

162

~8.2% (96/1,172) of all documented infections in the HCP at this institution. In total, we

163

sequenced 237 samples collected between 15 March and 27 December, 2020. Of these, 182

164

met quality standards (as described in methods) and were used for downstream analysis. We

165

did not find a closely related virus among the epidemiologically linked contacts in 58 HCP

166

infections, so we concluded the most likely source of infection in these cases could be traced to

167

the outside community (58/96; 60.4%). We find a smaller percentage could be traced to a

168

coworker (10/96; 10.4%) or were part of a patient-employee cluster (12/96; 12.5%). Strikingly,

169

the smallest proportion of HCP infections could be clearly traced to a patient source (4/96;

170

4.2%). The remaining HCP infections could not be definitively traced to a single source and

171

were therefore inconclusive (12/96; 12.5%) (Table 1). Below, we describe one representative

172

example of three distinct transmission scenarios – outside community-to-HCP, HCP-to-HCP,

173

and patient-to-HCP. A brief overview of all cases included in this study can be found in

174

Supplementary File 1.

175
176

In case #20, we compared the viral sequence of a HCP (HCP 20-1), who tested positive in early

177

October, to a patient contact who tested positive eight days prior. A comprehensive caregiver

178

trace of HCP 20-1 revealed a single patient contact with diagnosed COVID-19 (patient 20-A)

179

within the 14 days prior HCP 20-1’s symptom onset. HCP 20-1 provided direct care to patient

180

20-A while wearing appropriate PPE and with no reported lapses in PPE. Viral sequencing

181

revealed HCP 20-1 was infected with a virus clustering with the 20G clade whereas patient 20-A

182

was infected with a 20A-clade virus. The sequences of these viruses differed at >20 sites, so we

183

concluded these individuals were unlikely to represent a transmission pair and HCP 20-1 was

184

more likely infected in the outside community (Figure 1).

186

In case #16, we investigated infections in three HCP who worked in the same department and

187

tested positive in early September (HCP 16-2), mid-September (HCP 16-1), and late September

188

(HCP 16-3). Contact tracing revealed HCP 16-2 worked for two days prior to symptom onset

189

and may have had unmasked contact with HCP 16-1 during overlapping meal breaks. Contact

190

tracing additionally revealed HCP 16-3 had an exposure event lasting >15 minutes in the

191

outside community prior to testing positive. Viral sequencing in this cluster showed HCP 16-1

192

and 16-2 were infected with 20G-clade viruses that were identical at the consensus level, while

193

HCP 16-3 was infected with a genetically dissimilar 20A-clade virus. We therefore concluded

194

HCP 16-2 was a likely source of infection for HCP 16-1, while HCP 16-3 was likely infected

195

elsewhere (Figure 2).

196
197

Case #10 involved a HCP (HCP 10-1) who provided care for 15 patients diagnosed with

198

COVID-19 in the 14 days prior to HCP 10-1’s symptom onset. HCP 10-1 provided direct care to

199

each of these patients while wearing appropriate PPE with no reported lapses in PPE. We

200

generated consensus sequences from HCP 10-1 and nine patient contacts. There was

201

insufficient viral RNA (vRNA) in the remaining six patient contacts to generate high-quality

202

consensus sequences for comparison. The virus isolated from patient 10-G was identical to the

203

virus from HCP 10-1. Given the known epidemiological association between these two

204

individuals (HCP 10-1 provided direct patient care to patient 10-G), the time separating sample

205

collections (late July & early August), and identical viral sequences, we concluded patient 10-G

206

is a likely source of infection for HCP 10-1 (Figure 3).

207
208

The center where we conducted this case series implemented a number of changes to their

209

institutional infection control guidelines based on these sequencing results 13. The

210

recommendations for extended reuse of medical grade face masks were clarified and now

211

instruct HCP to consider barrier mask replacement after three days of wear, to inspect the

212

barrier mask prior to each use and to replace if soiled or damaged, and to always ask for PPE

213

when needed. N-95s or powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) are now universally required

214

on inpatient units housing COVID-19-confirmed and suspected patients. In addition, medical-

215

grade face masks, instead of cloth masks, are now required for HCP in all clinical areas, and not

216

just direct patient care areas. This final recommendation was based on likely HCP-to-HCP

217

transmission involving a HCP who was not directly involved in patient care of COVID-19

218

patients (case #14 in Supplementary File 1).

219

Discussion

220

HCP across the hospital are involved in caring for people with COVID-19, whether or not they

221

work on an actual COVID-19 ward. With shifting guidelines and PPE shortages that persist

222

today, it is critical to assess the risk that HCP treating people with known SARS-CoV-2 infection

223

will become infected themselves. Here we used viral genome sequencing to assess the risk that

224

HCP in a large academic medical system treating COVID-19 patients would acquire nosocomial

225

infections. Although others have written about the potential utility of sequencing as an infection

226

control asset within clinical settings, few have demonstrated the practical application of such

227

efforts 3–5. Our results suggest that caring for COVID-19 patients accounted for a minority of

228

HCP infections (n=4), even while evaluating high-risk infections where epidemiological data

229

alone could not be used to rule out healthcare-associated transmission. In contrast, HCP at this

230

institution were much more likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 from infected coworkers (n=10) or in

231

the outside community (n=58). This result suggests that infection control procedures,

232

consistently followed, offer significant protection to HCP caring for COVID-19 patients in the

233

United States. A similar conclusion was drawn by recent studies evaluating healthcare-

234

associated infections in the Netherlands and in the UK, suggesting this conclusion may hold

235

across healthcare systems 1,2.

236
237

Our results suggest that the infection control measures and PPE in place at the institution where

238

we conducted this case series 13 can protect against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, even

239

in settings where the density of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is relatively high. This

240

provides some confidence that PPE and similar infection control measures, when used

241

consistently and correctly, will provide adequate protection in other congregate settings, like

242

schools. The impact of reopening primary schools remains unclear, yet the long-term

243

consequences of remote learning and physical distancing on children, particularly those from

244

disadvantaged backgrounds, are of increasing concern 26. In addition to reducing rates of

245

community spread, it follows that schools should prioritize making PPE and training on its

246

appropriate use available to all staff 27. Similar precautions are needed in other congregate

247

settings as well, such as correctional facilities and factories, to protect inmates and workers.

248
249

The effectiveness of hospital- and clinic-like PPE and infection control guidelines used in other

250

congregate settings should similarly be evaluated following implementation. As the cost of viral

251

sequencing continues to drop and sequencing technologies continue to improve, the integration

252

of rapid pathogen sequence information with traditional epidemiological investigation

253

approaches is possible at the level of individual hospitals, clinics, school systems, and

254

correctional facilities. Such systems would allow for the rapid reconstruction of transmission

255

networks. These systems would also inform feedback loops for schools and institutions to

256

continually assess and improve the efficacy of infection control and PPE procedures in

257

protecting HCP, teachers, children, workers, and individuals who are incarcerated. We should

258

work to build such systems now because we can be certain pathogenic viruses will continue to

259

emerge unpredictably.

261

Sampling and contact tracing of nosocomial outbreaks is often coordinated by local hospitals

262

and/or departments of health while expertise in viral sequencing, bioinformatics, and

263

phylogenetics can more often be found in academic laboratories. Successful application of

264

precision epidemiology requires the integration of these areas. This is possible now at academic

265

medical institutions like ours, but presents more of a challenge at smaller, rural, and private

266

patient care centers. Federal support should be provided to help establish and maintain these

267

collaborations in the current pandemic and in anticipation of future outbreaks.

268
269

Importantly, we were only able to evaluate samples for which residual swab was available and

270

for which we were able to generate high-quality consensus sequences. Given this limitation, we

271

were often able to exclude patient contacts and co-workers as likely sources of infection in HCP,

272

but we were rarely able to pinpoint the exact source of infection, especially when it occurred

273

outside of the healthcare setting. In addition, this study only examined SARS-CoV-2 infections

274

in HCP from a single academic medical center so our conclusions may not be broadly

275

generalizable. However, another recent study evaluated healthcare-associated infections in the

276

Netherlands and similarly found no evidence for widespread nosocomial transmission of SARS-

277

CoV-2, suggesting our conclusions may hold across institutions and healthcare systems 1.

278

Further, we were not able to differentiate between routes of infection (airborne, droplet, contact)

279

with the limited epidemiological data available to us in this study.

280

Here we demonstrated how rapid whole-genome sequencing of current SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks

281

in hospitals can be used retrospectively to reconstruct the likely source of HCP infection and

282

prospectively to adjust and improve infection control practices and guidelines. The approach we

283

describe here need not be limited to investigation of pandemic virus outbreaks. Key concepts

284

from genome sequencing and routine pathogen surveillance can be applied to any nosocomial

285

pathogen and inform changes to infection control practices. Overall, while we do find examples

of patient-to-HCP and HCP-to-HCP spread, the majority of HCP infections appeared to be

287

acquired through community exposure, emphasizing the importance of ongoing measures to

288

reduce community spread through mask-wearing, physical distancing, robust testing programs,

289

and rapid distribution of vaccines.

290

Methods

291

Sample approvals and sample selection criteria

292

From 12 March 2020 to 10 January 2021, ~1,172 HCP tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a

293

major academic medical institution in the Upper Midwest. In the case of infections where

294

epidemiological data alone could not rule out healthcare-associated infection, we sequenced

295

viral genomes from all available residual specimens from the individuals involved in these

296

outbreaks. These clusters included at least one HCP, SARS-CoV-2-positive patient contacts,

297

and occasionally extended to epidemiologically-linked hospital staff and household contacts.

298

Relevant patient contacts were identified in the Epic electronic medical record using a

299

comprehensive caregiver trace. This function identifies all patient records accessed by a HCP

300

being traced.

301

Summary of infection control measures to prevent transmission of

302

SARS-CoV-2 at our institution

303

Detailed descriptions of all infection control measures implemented to prevent transmission of

304

SARS-CoV-2 at the medical institution evaluated here can be found in a recent report by Lepak

305

et al 13. Briefly, these guidelines include a universal testing policy for all patients admitted to the

306

hospital, negative air pressure in all locations where SARS-CoV-2 patients are treated, a limit of

307

one visitor or primary support person per patient per day (required to undergo screening prior to

308

entry), establishment of an employee testing site with required employee self-monitoring for

309

signs and symptoms of infection, maintenance of a log of persons entering the room of a

310

confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient for contact tracing purposes, and establishment of a

311

designated respiratory care unit in the emergency department, among others. PPE guidelines

312

include universal masking and face-shield use with any patient care contact, enhanced PPE

313

requirements for HCP working in the intensive care unit or performing aerosol-generating

314

procedures, and formal donning and doffing protocols and required training for all HCP, among

315

others.

316

vRNA isolation

317

All samples were isolated using a Maxwell isolation instrument and subsequently processed

318

using a modified ARTIC tiled amplicon approach 28,29. Nasopharyngeal swabs received in

319

transport medium (VTM) were briefly centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 30 seconds at room

320

temperature to ensure all residual sample sediments at the bottom of the tube. Viral RNA

321

(vRNA) was extracted from 100 μl of VTM using the Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification kit

322

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) on a Maxwell RSC 48 instrument and was eluted in 50 μL of

323

nuclease-free H2O.

324

Complementary DNA (cDNA) generation

325

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a modified ARTIC Network approach 28,29.

326

Briefly, vRNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen,

327

Carlsbad, CA, USA) using random hexamers and dNTPs. Reaction conditions were as follows:

328

1μL of random hexamers and 1µL of dNTPs were added to 11 μL of sample RNA, heated to

329

65˚C for 5 minutes, then cooled to 4˚C for 1 minute. Then 7 μL of a master mix (4 μL 5x RT

330

buffer, 1 μL 0.1M DTT, 1µL RNaseOUT RNase Inhibitor, and 1 μL SSIV RT) was added and

331

incubated at 42˚C for 10 minutes, 70˚C for 10 minutes, and then 4˚C for 1 minute.

332

Multiplex PCR to generate SARS-CoV-2 genomes

333

A SARS-CoV-2-specific multiplex PCR for Nanopore sequencing was performed, similar to

334

amplicon-based approaches as previously described 28,29. In short, primers for 96 overlapping

335

amplicons spanning the entire genome with amplicon lengths of 500bp and overlapping by 75 to

336

100bp between the different amplicons were used to generate cDNA. cDNA (2.5 μL) was

337

amplified in two multiplexed PCR reactions using Q5 Hot-Start DNA High-fidelity Polymerase

338

(New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) using the conditions previously described

339

Samples were amplified through 25 cycles of PCR and each resulting multiplex sample was

340

pooled together before ONT library prep.

341

Library preparation and sequencing

342

Amplified PCR product was purified using a 1:1 concentration of AMPure XP beads (Beckman

343

Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and eluted in 30μL of water. PCR products were quantified using Qubit

344

dsDNA high-sensitivity kit (Invitrogen, USA) and were diluted to a final concentration of 1 ng/μl.

345

A total of 5ng for each sample was then made compatible for deep sequencing using the one-

346

pot native ligation protocol with Oxford Nanopore kit SQK-LSK109 and its Native Barcodes

347

(EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114) 29. Specifically, samples were end-repaired using the

348

NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA).

349

Samples were then barcoded using 2.5µL of ONT Native Barcodes and the Ultra II End Repair

350

Module. After barcoding, samples were pooled directly into a 1:1 concentration of AMPure XP

351

beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) and eluted in 30µL of water. Samples were then

352

tagged with ONT sequencing adaptors according to the modified one-pot ligation protocol 29. Up

353

to 24 samples were pooled prior to being run on the appropriate flow cell (FLO-MIN106) using

354

the 72hr run script.

355

Processing raw ONT data

356

Sequencing data was processed using the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline

357

(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019), with a few modifications. Briefly, we have

358

modified the ARTIC pipeline so that it demultiplexes raw fastq files using qcat as each fastq file

359

is generated by the GridION (https://github.com/nanoporetech/qcat). Once a barcode reaches

360

100k reads, it will trigger the rest of the ARTIC bioinformatics workflow which will map to the

361

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 reference (Genbank:

362

MN908947.3) using minimap2. This alignment will then be used to generate consensus

363

sequences and variant calls using medaka (https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka). The

364

entire ONT analysis pipeline is available at https://github.com/gagekmoreno/SARS-CoV-2-in-

365

Southern-Wisconsin.

366

Consensus sequence analysis – clade and lineage generation

367

Following the generation of consensus sequences via the above ARTIC pipeline, samples were

368

excluded from downstream analysis if gaps in the consensus sequence totaled ≥20% of the

369

genome. Each sample’s consensus sequence within a report (or as many as possible), were

370

visually inspected in Geneious Prime (https://www.geneious.com) and/or in Nextstrain’s

371

Nextclade online tool (https://clades.nextstrain.org/). When inspecting in Geneious, we aligned

372

all sequences to a standard reference sequence – an early Wuhan sequence (Genbank:

373

MN908947.3). Using these alignments as well as exported Nextclade CSV files, we were able to

374

quickly identify consensus intrahost single nucleotide variant (iSNV) differences. We additionally

375

used Nextstrain’s Nextclade tool to assign clades. We used Pangolin’s command-line tool to

376

assign sequences to Pangolin lineages (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin).

377
378

As noted in the results, for us to conclude person A was a likely source of infection for person B,

379

persons A and B must have had known contact or epidemiological links, they must have been

380

tested within 0-14 days of each other, and they must be infected with identical or near-identical

381

(≤1 consensus iSNV difference) viruses.

384

Wisconsin-centric time-resolved and divergence phylogenetic trees (seen in Supplementary

385

File 1) were built using the standard Nextstrain tools and scripts 30.

386

Report generation

387

For each sample set, we drafted these results into a PDF report to be shared with the hospital

388

infection control team. These reports were drafted in a standardized format. In each report, we

389

outlined the purpose for the report, the samples involved including any associated metadata, a

390

brief description of the methods used to generate the sequence data, a screen grab of a

391

Nextclade alignment, a table summarizing the iSNV differences, phylogenetic trees if applicable,

392

and finally any overall conclusions that could be drawn regarding the likely and unlikely sources

393

of infection. A summary of each of these reports can be found in Supplementary File 1.
