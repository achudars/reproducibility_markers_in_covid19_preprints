Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has expanded rapidly throughout China. Major behavioral, clinical, and
state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the
virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented
interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time
mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case
importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on,
the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data.
Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became
negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of
local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures
implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

Main text
The outbreak of COVID-19 has spread rapidly from its origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (1). A
range of interventions have been implemented following the detection in late December 2019 of a cluster
of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology, and identification of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 in early
January 2020 (2). Interventions include improved rates of diagnostic testing, clinical management, rapid
isolation of suspected and confirmed cases and, most notably, restrictions on mobility (hereafter called
cordon sanitaire) imposed on Wuhan city on 23rd January. Travel restrictions were subsequently imposed
on 14 other cities across Hubei Province and partial movement restrictions have been enacted in many
cities across China. Initial analysis suggests that the Wuhan cordon sanitaire resulted in an average delay
of COVID-19 spread to other cities of 3 days (3), but the true extent of the effect of the mobility
restrictions and other types of interventions on transmission has not been examined in detail (4, 5).
Questions remain over how these interventions affected the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to locations outside
of Wuhan. We here use real-time mobility data, crowdsourced line-list data of cases with reported travel

history, and timelines of reporting changes to identify early shifts in the epidemiological dynamics of the
COVID-19 epidemic in China, from an epidemic driven by frequent importations to local transmission.

Human mobility predicts the spread and size of epidemics in China
As of 1st March 2020, 79,986 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China (Fig. 1a) (10). Reports
of cases in China were mostly restricted to Hubei until 23rd January 2020 (81% of all cases), after which
most provinces reported rapid increases in cases (Fig. 1a). We build a line list dataset from reported cases
in China with information on travel history and demographic characteristics. We note that the majority of
early cases (before 23rd January 2020, Materials and Methods) reported outside of Wuhan had known
travel history to Wuhan (57%) and were distributed across China (Fig. 1b), highlighting the importance
of Wuhan as the major source. However, testing was initially focused mainly on travelers to Wuhan,
potentially biasing our estimates of travel related infections upwards (Materials and Methods). Among
cases known to have traveled from Wuhan before 23rd January 2020, the time from symptom onset to
confirmation was 6.5 days (SD: 4.2, Fig. S2), providing opportunity for onward transmission at the
destination. More active surveillance brought this interval down to 4.8 days (SD: 3.03, Fig. S2) for those
who travelled after 23rd January 2020.

To identify accurately a timeframe for evaluating early shifts in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China, we
first estimated from case data the average incubation period of COVID-19 infection (i.e. the duration
between time of infection and symptom onset (6, 7)). Since infection events are typically not directly
observed, we estimate incubation period from the span of exposure during which infection likely
occurred. Using detailed information on 38 cases for whom both the dates of entry to and exit from
Wuhan are known, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 5.1 days (std. dev. = 3.0 days; Fig. S1),
similar to previous estimates from other data (8, 9). In subsequent analyses we add an upper estimate of
one incubation period (mean + 1 standard deviation = 8 days) to the date of Wuhan shutdown, in order to

delineate the date before which cases recorded in other provinces might represent infections acquired in
Hubei (i.e. 1st February 2020; Fig. 1a).

In order to understand whether the volume of travel within China can predict the epidemic outside of
Wuhan, we analyzed real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc., together with epidemiological data
from each province (Materials and Methods). Small local transmission clusters (in a family) of COVID19 were first reported in Guangzhou, Guangdong province (14). We investigated spatio-temporal disease

spread to elucidate the relative contribution of Wuhan to transmission elsewhere and evaluate how the
cordon sanitaire may have impacted it.

Among cases reported outside Hubei province in our dataset, we observe 515 cases with known travel
history to Wuhan and a symptom onset date before 31st January 2020, compared with only 39 after 31st
January, 2020, illustrating the effect of travel restrictions (Figs. 1b, 2a, Fig. S3). We confirm the expected
decline of importation with real-time human mobility data from Baidu Inc. Movements of individuals out
of Wuhan increased in the days before the Lunar New Year and the establishment of the cordon sanitaire,
before rapidly decreasing to almost no movement (Figs. 2a,b). The travel ban appears to have prevented
travel in and out of Wuhan around the time of the Lunar New Year celebration (Fig. 2a) and likely
reduced further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan.

To test the contribution of the epidemic in Wuhan to seeding epidemics elsewhere in China we build a
naïve COVID-19 GLM (15) model of daily case counts (Materials and Methods). We estimate the
epidemic doubling time outside Hubei to be 4.0 days (range across provinces of 3.6 - 5.0 days) and
estimate the epidemic doubling time within Hubei to be 7.2 days, consistent with previous reports (5, 9,
16, 17). Our predicts daily case counts across all provinces with relatively high accuracy (as measured
with a pseudo-R2 from a negative binomial GLM) throughout early February 2020, and when accounting
for human mobility (Figs. 2c, Table S1, S2).

We find that the magnitude of the epidemic (total number of cases until February 10, 2020) outside of
Wuhan is remarkably well predicted by the volume of human movement out of Wuhan alone (R2 = 0.89
from a log-linear regression using cumulative cases, Fig. S8). Therefore cases exported from Wuhan prior
to the cordon sanitaire appear to have not only contributed to initiating local chains of transmission, both
in neighboring provinces such as Henan, and in comparatively more distant provinces, e.g., Guangdong

and Zhejiang (Figs. 1a, 2b) but that the frequency of introductions from Wuhan are also predictive of the
size of the epidemic in other provinces (controlling for population size).

After 1st February 2020 (corresponding to one mean + one SD incubation period after the cordon sanitaire
and other interventions were implemented), the correlation of daily case counts and human mobility from
Wuhan decreases (Figs. 2c) which indicates that variability is better explained by other factors such as
local public health response. This suggests that travel restrictions may have reduced the flow of case
importations from Wuhan; but also that other factors guiding a local epidemic may be taking over.

correlation between daily incidence in Wuhan and incidence in all other provinces weighted by human
mobility.

We also estimate the growth rates of the epidemic in all other provinces (Materials and Methods).
Interestingly, we find that all provinces outside Hubei experienced faster growth rates between January 9th
– January 22nd, 2020 (Fig. 3b, Fig. S4b) which was the time before travel restrictions and drastic control
measures were implemented (Fig. 3c, Fig. S6); this is also apparent from the case counts by province
(Fig. S6). In the same period, we show that variation in the growth rates are almost entirely explained by
human movements from Wuhan (Fig. 3c), consistent with theory of infectious disease spread in highly
coupled metapopulations (19, 20). Following the implementation of drastic control measures across the
country, growth rates become negative (Fig 3b), indicating that transmission is being successfully
mitigated. The correlation of growth rates and human mobility from Wuhan becomes negative, i.e.
provinces with larger mobility prior to the cordon sanitaire (but also larger number of cases overall) have
more rapidly declining growth rates of daily case counts. This could be partly due to travel restrictions but
also the fact that control measures may have been more drastic in locations with larger outbreaks with
local transmission (see more detail in section “Current role of imported cases in Chinese provinces”).

The travel ban coincides with increased testing capacity across provinces in China. An alternative
hypothesis is that the observed epidemiological patterns outside Wuhan are the result of increased testing
capacity. We test this hypothesis by including differences in testing capacity before and after the rollout
of large scale testing in China on 20th of January 2020 and test its impact on the predictability of daily
cases (Materials and Methods). We plot the relative improvement in the prediction of our model (based
on normalized residual error) of (i) a model that includes mobility from Wuhan and (ii) a model that
includes testing availability (see more details in Materials and Methods). Overall, the inclusion of
mobility data from Wuhan produces a significant improvement in the models prediction (delta-BIC > 250,
(24)) over a naive model that considers only autochthonous transmission with a doubling time of 2-8 days
(Fig. 3b). Of the 27 provinces in China reporting cases through February 6th, 2020, we find that in 12
provinces the largest improvements in prediction can be achieved using mobility only (Fig. S5). In 10
provinces, both testing and mobility improve the models prediction and in only one province testing is the
most important factor improving model prediction (Fig. S5). We conclude that laboratory testing during
the early phase of the epidemic is critical, however, mobility out of Wuhan remains the main driver of
spread prior to the shutdown.

Current role of imported cases in Chinese provinces
As case counts are decreasing outside Wuhan (Fig 3b), we can further investigate the current contribution
of imported cases to local epidemics outside Wuhan by investigating case characteristics. Age and sex
distributions can reflect heterogeneities in the risk of infection within affected populations. To investigate

meaningful shifts in the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak through time, we examined age and sex
data for cases from different periods of the outbreak, and from individuals with and without travel from
Wuhan. However, details of travel history exist for only a fraction of confirmed cases and this
information is particularly scant for some provinces (e.g. Zhejiang and Guangdong). Consequently, we
grouped confirmed cases into four categories: (I) early cases with travel history (early = reported before
1st Feb), (II) early cases without travel history, (III) later cases with travel history (later = reported
between 1st – 10th Feb), (IV) later cases without travel history.

Using crowdsourced case data, we found that cases with travel history (categories I and III) had similar
median ages and sex ratios in both the early and later phases of the outbreak (41 vs 42 years old, 50%
interquartile interval: 32.75 vs 30.75 and 54.25 vs 53.5 respectively, p-value > 0.1; 1.47 vs. 1.45 males
per female, respectively; Fig. 4d, Fig. S7). Early cases with no information on travel history (category II)
had a similar median age and sex ratio to those with known travel history (42 years old (50% interquartile
interval: 30.5 – 49.5, p-value > 0.1) and 1.80 males per female, Fig. 4d). However, the sex ratio of later
cases without reported travel history (category IV) shifted to approximately 1:1 (57 male vs. 62 female,
X2 test, p-value < 0.01), as expected under a null hypothesis of equal transmission risk (Fig. 4a,b,d, see
also reference (11, 12), Materials and Methods) and the median age in this group increased to 46 (50%
interquartile interval: 34.25 – 58, t-test: p-value < 0.01) (Figs. 4a,b,c, Fig. S7). We hypothesize that many
of the cases with no known travel history in the early period were indeed travelers that contributed to
disseminating SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan. The shift towards more equal sex ratios and older ages in
non-travellers after 31st January 2020 confirm the finding that epidemics outside Wuhan were then driven
by local transmission dynamics. The case definition changed to include cases without travel history to
Wuhan after 23th January 2020 (Materials and Methods).

Discussion
Containment of respiratory infections is particularly difficult if they are characterized by relatively mild
symptoms or transmission before the onset of disease (25). Intensive control measures, including travel
restrictions, have been implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19 in China. Here, we showed that this
combination of interventions was successful in mitigating the spread and reduce local transmission of
COVID-19 in China although it is not possible to definitively determine the individual impact of each
intervention. More analyses will be required to determine how to optimally balance the expected positive
effects on health with the negative impact on individual liberties, the economy, and society at large.

Epidemiological data: No officially reported line list was available for cases in China (26). We use a
standard protocol (27, 28) to extract individual level data from December 1st, 2019 - February 10th, 2020.
Sources are mainly official reports from provincial, municipal or national health governments. Data
included basic demographics (age, sex), travel histories and key dates (dates of onset of symptoms,
hospitalization, and confirmation). Data were entered by a team of data curators on a rolling basis and
technical validation and geo-positioning protocols were applied continuously to ensure validity. A
detailed description of the methodology is available (27) (attached in Supplementary information).
Lastly, total numbers were matched with officially reported data from China and other government
reports. For sensitivity, GLM analyses (see below) were performed with case counts from the World
Health Organization.

Proportions of symptomatic travelers: The proportion of cases who travelled while symptomatic was
assessed from a subset of 236 cases for whom the dates of symptom onset and departure from Wuhan
were available. Residency was split into three categories: Wuhan, China and International. Foreigners
living in Wuhan were categorized as Wuhan and patients with missing Wuhan residency were either kept
as missing values or categorized according to their country of origin. Both parametric (χ² test, (29)) and
non-parametric (exact Fisher test, (30)) tests were performed and the uncertainty in proportions was
assessed by the standard deviation of sample proportions.

Statistical inference of the incubation period: The incubation period is the time interval between
infection and symptom onset. We assumed that cases travelling from Wuhan were exposed during their
stay in Wuhan. We estimated the incubation period from 38 travelling cases returning from Wuhan with
known dates of symptom onset, entry and exit. The end of the exposure period was assumed to be the
exit travel date except if symptom onset occurred prior to the exit date (in which case exposure was
assumed to have occurred prior to symptom onset). The start of the exposure period corresponded to the
entry date. We assumed that the incubation period could not exceed 30 days.

For each case, the minimum and maximum incubation period was derived from the dates of entry, exit
and symptom onset

We fitted a truncated gamma distribution (0 to 30 days) and estimated the mean and variance of the
incubation period using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a Bayesian framework using an
uninformative prior distribution. We derived the likelihood as follows:

A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was implemented in R. Marginal posteriors were sampled from a chain
of 5,000 steps after discarding a burn-in of 50 steps. Convergence was inspected visually.

Models of shifting age and sex distributions: Age and sex distributions are important in understanding
risk of infection across populations. Assuming risk to be distributed relatively equally across a
population, as an outbreak evolves age and sex distributions should follow the underlying population
structure. Varying degrees of immunity and exposure may shift these distributions (31). To examine
whether the ongoing outbreak shifted from an epidemic concentrated in Wuhan and among travelers from

Wuhan to an epidemic that was self-sustained in provinces across China we use age and sex data from
different periods of the outbreak for individuals with reported travel history and no known travel history.
We define two periods of the outbreak, an “early” phase, starting with the first reports in early December
and ending a set number of days after the Wuhan shutdown. This was selected to be 8 days after the
Wuhan shutdown, which conservatively corresponds to one incubation period + 1SD (see above) after the
shutdown. After that date (i.e. 1st Feb 2020) we assume that most reported transmissions in provinces
outside of Wuhan are the result of local transmission. We further divided our data in those that had cases
with known travel history to Wuhan and those who did not. Then we produce the following summary
statistics:

1. Average age stratified by sex for all cases with reported travel history to Wuhan.
2. Average age stratified by sex for all cases with no reported travel history to Wuhan in the period
between December 1, 2019 - January 31, 2020.

We then compare these with:
3. Average age stratified by sex for all cases with no reported travel history to Wuhan in the period
between January 31, 2020 - February 10, 2020.

Model M1 compares the distribution of age and sex among travelers to the reported infections outside
Wuhan with no known travel history. In case these two distributions are similar, import driven epidemic
can be concluded. Under our model assumptions M2, if the epidemic was driven largely by importations
across the two time periods, all age and sex distributions should mirror those of the reported traveler
infections. Under our model assumption M3, if the epidemic was driven by other factors (i.e., local
transmission), the two distributions should vary across the two time periods.

We cannot exclude the possibility that shifts in distributions may be due to heightened awareness among
the general population which may have increased reporting in female cases later in the epidemic. Further,
more work will be necessary to understand the differential risk of severe or symptomatic disease to fully
understand the age and sex distributions in this outbreak. For example, why there are relatively few
reports of cases <18y old. However, as for other respiratory pathogens symptomatic and severe infection
were more concentrated in older populations. We do not intend to make any general statements about
differential risk but were more interested in shifts in reported cases across multiple geographies in China.

Real time human mobility data: We extract human mobility data from the Baidu Qianxi web platform,
which presents daily population travels between cities or provinces tracked through the Baidu Huiyan
system. The data do not represent numbers of individual travelers but rather an index of relative
movements constructed by Baidu’s proprietary methods which are correlated with human mobility (32)
(http://qianxi.baidu.com/). In particular, two pieces of information are collected. First, we extract a series
of migration scale indices for traveling out of Wuhan, from January 1st to February 10, both in 2019 and
2020. Second, we obtain the proportion of human movement from Wuhan were bound for each of 31
provinces in China. These proportions are available for January 1st - February 10, 2020. Based on this
data we had access to both changes in mobility volume and changes in mobility direction. See more
detailed descriptions of the human movement data here: (33, 34)

Review of interventions and reporting shifts: We reviewed the literature and online social media to
understand the key timings of interventions and announcements that are relevant for disease transmission
across China. We collated information about the type (e.g., announcement of outbreak, travel restrictions,
isolation of patients, etc.), geographic location (e.g., city where available, province), and timing (specific
date or date range).

Comparing predictive models of epidemic trajectories: To evaluate hypotheses regarding the effect of
mobility and testing on COVID-19 dynamics, we fit three different Generalized Linear Models (GLM).

Model 1 was a Poisson GLM to estimate daily case counts, Model 2 was a negative binomial GLM to
estimate daily case counts, and Model 3 was a log-linear regression to estimate daily cumulative cases.
BIC scores shown in Fig. 4b are calculated on a GLM of the form Y(t) = Y(t-4) + IT(t) + M(t-5) + IM(t)
where Y(t) is either the number of new cases observed on day t (Model 1 & 2) or cumulative number of
cases observed through day t (Model 3), Y(t-4) represents the number of cases (or the cumulative number
under Model 3) four days prior (median doubling time outside Hubei province), IT(t) is an indicator
function for PCR test availability that is 1 after 19th January 2020 and 0 before, M(t-5) is the Baidu.Incestimated mobility between Wuhan and each province 5 days prior (median incubation period), and IM(t)
is an indicator function which is set to 1 after 26th January 2020 and 0 before (which represents one
median incubation period from 22nd January 2020). Models were fit to province-level data. The three
models were compared using differences in Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), where larger values
indicate models with lower relative support, and BIC>4 considered the cutoff for substantial model
improvement. We performed a detailed sensitivity analysis on the availability of PCR tests, doubling
time, and incubation periods. We obtained qualitatively similar results for Model 1 (Poisson GLM fit to
daily case counts), Model 2 (negative binomial GLM fit to daily case counts ), and Model 3 (log-linear
regressions fit to cumulative cases), see Table S2. In addition, we provide a full time series analysis of the
optimal lag structure for cases and mobility for each province. Additionally, although BIC is considered
more conservative, model selection results were confirmed using AIC for model selection (see Fig. 4 and
Table S2). Lastly, we validated our model selection results using elastic-net regression and n-fold cross
validation as implemented in the R package GLMNET (11, 12.

Estimating epidemic doubling time: To estimate the epidemic doubling time across each province, we
fit a mixed effects Poisson GLM of daily case counts to days since the first case report in each province
(fixed effect) and a random effect for each province on the slope and intercept, using the R package lme4
v.1.1-21 (35). Daily case counts were determined using the date of symptom onset. However, we only
have a symptom onset date for 667 cases. Where the date of symptom onset was not available, we

estimated the symptom onset date based on a linear regression model where symptom onset date was fit
to confirmation date (n =632 with both onset and confirmation dates, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.77). Using this
model, we estimated the onset date for the 31436 cases with a recorded confirmation date.

Model selection via elastic-net regression and cross-validation: We fit regularized Poisson and
negative binomial models with an elastic net penalty, i.e., 50/50 mixture of the lasso and ridge penalties,
with the regularization coefficient (lambda) selected by leave-one-out cross-validation. As seen with the
AIC/BIC-based model selection, the regularized model included terms for lagged cases, the mobility and
testing indicator variables, and mobility out of Wuhan. The out-of-sample log likelihood for the
regularized Poisson regression was -9102 and was -22519 for the negative binomial model. The
significantly worse fit for the negative binomial model was primarily driven by two outlier predictions,
removing those results in an out-of-sample log likelihood for the negative binomial model of -11625.
Models were implemented in the R package glmnet v. 2.0-18 (36). Because glmnet has not implemented a
negative binomial model, we performed regularization using the Poisson model and estimated the
overdispersion parameter using the glm.nb function in the R package MASS v. 7.3-51.4 (37).

Supplementary text:
To ascertain whether earlier travel restrictions could have prevented the wide-spread increase in cases
witnessed in late-January we constructed a simple forecasting model for COVID-19. Briefly, we forecast
the cumulative number of cases in each Chinese province by simply doubling the number of cumulative
cases reported six days prior. For dates prior to Jan. 28th and after Feb 3rd, this naive forecast produces
an accurate estimate of the cumulative number of cases in each province (Fig. S4). However, the
cumulative number of cases reported on Jan 28th is poorly estimated using this model (Fig. S4). In order
to accurately forecast the number of cases on Jan 28th, we must also include the relative amount of
mobility out of Wuhan into various provinces in the regression model. In Fig. S4, we show how a model
including only movement from Wuhan on January 22nd fit to the residuals from Fig. S4 is once again

restrictions must be prompt.

Relative improvement in model fit (Mobility)

Figure S5: Relative importance of PCR testing vs. human mobility to improve a simple GLM of COVID19 when estimating exponential growth in province-level cases. Relative improvement is measured as one
minus the residuals of a GLM with lagged cases + PCR testing availability (y-axis) and a GLM with
lagged cases + mobility from Wuhan. Values were normalized by the observed number of cases such that
they ranged between 0 and 1. The resulting metric has a value of 0 for a model where the residual error
