Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, which were first detected in the United
Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, are spreading rapidly in the human population.
Thus, there is an increased need for genomic and epidemiological surveillance in order to
detect the strains and estimate their abundances. Here, we report a genomic analysis of
SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment
plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the
presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the
samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same
amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated
December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid
December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland. We
conclude that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater samples may help detect
and monitor the circulation of diverse lineages.

Background
Viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons can be found in faeces ​(Gupta et al. 2020)​ and
accordingly, at the community level, in the wastewater collected in wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs) ​(Kitajima et al. 2020; Medema et al. 2020; Gonzalez et al. 2020)​. In
principle, wastewater samples can provide a snapshot of the circulating viral lineages and
their diversity in the community ​(Izquierdo Lara et al. 2020; Nemudryi et al. 2020; Martin et
al. 2020; Crits-Christoph et al. 2020)​ and serve as an efficient and complementary approach

to
genomic epidemiology based on individual patient samples ​(Nadeau et al. 2020)​.

However, it is challenging to analyze wastewater samples for SARS-CoV-2 genomic
composition, because samples are enriched in PCR inhibitors during the virus concentration
steps, viral genomes may be fragmented, and sewage contains large amounts of bacterial,
human and other viral DNA and RNA genomes ​(Cantalupo et al. 2011; Fernandez-Cassi et
al. 2018; Martínez-Puchol et al. 2020)​. Even if amplified and sequenced successfully, the
read data obtained from the mixture of viral genomes from different infected persons is
difficult to interpret, because of amplification biases, sequencing errors, and insufficient
phasing information. Detecting a viral lineage that is present only in a small fraction of
infected persons, such as, for example, a recently mutated or imported new viral variant into
an area with an ongoing local outbreak, is therefore a major challenge, similar to identifying
low-frequency variants within single-patient samples ​(Kuipers et al. 2020; Karamitros et al.
2020; Rose et al. 2020)​. On the other hand, tracking the genomic composition of viral RNA
in the community in multiple samples over time increases our ability to make reliable calls
and offers an opportunity to monitor the circulation of diverse SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 (or VOC-202012/01), which was first found in the
UK (​Rambau et al. 2020​), and 501.V2 (or S501Y.V2), which was identified in South Africa
(Tegally et al. 2020)​, have recently generated a lot of interest as they may be associated
with increased infectivity and hence accelerated spread in the human population (​Volz et al.
2020​, ​Vöhringer et al. 2020​) ​(Tegally et al. 2020)​. Although some of the mutations defining
these lineages arose independently before – without any evidence for increased
transmissibility so far ​(van Dorp et al. 2020)​ – the combination of 17 and 12 genetic
alterations, defining B.1.1.7 and 501.V2, respectively, is unique and may have unexpected
consequences on the phenotype. In Switzerland, the B.1.1.7 lineage was first detected in
two clinical samples on December 24 ​(Bundesamt für Gesundheit 2020a)​, and the 501.V2
lineage in another two samples on December 27 ​(Bundesamt für Gesundheit 2020b)​. To our
knowledge, one of the 501.V2 cases has no known epidemiological links to abroad and
several recent B.1.1.7 cases identified in Geneva have no known epidemiological links to
abroad indicating local transmission ​(Département de la sécurité, de l’emploi et de la santé,
Republic et Canton de Geneve 2021)​. However, it remains unknown to what extent the new
variants are already circulating in Switzerland. Sequencing community wastewater samples
offers an efficient and cost-effective way to address this epidemiologically important
question.
Here, we report a preliminary analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data obtained
from a total of 48 wastewater samples collected from three WWTPs in Switzerland between
July 8 and December 21, 2020. We explore what SARS-CoV-2 wastewater genomic data
can reveal about arising lineages and their circulation in the community and compare our
findings to about 5000 SARS-CoV-2 patient sequences collected in Switzerland.

Methods
Patient sequences. Per-patient SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences were downloaded from
GISAID ​(Shu and McCauley 2017)​ for all samples collected in Switzerland between
February 24 and December 24, 2020, and not identified as either B.1.1.7 or 501.V2 (see
supplementary material for the list of accession numbers).

Wastewater sample collection and preparation. Raw wastewater samples were collected
from three Swiss WWTPs: ARA Werdhölzli, Zurich (population connected: 450,000), STEP
de Vidy, Lausanne (population connected: 240,000), and the WWTP of an alpine ski resort.
Samples were concentrated and viral RNA was extracted using methods similar to those
previously reported ​(Medema et al. 2020)​. In brief, 24-hour composite samples (Zurich and
Lausanne) or grab samples (ski resort) were collected in 500ml polystyrene or polypropylene
plastic bottles, shipped on ice, and stored at 4°C for up to 6 days before processing. Aliquots
of 50 mL were clarified by filtration (2 µm glass fiber filter (Millipore) followed by a 0.22 µm
filter (Millipore), Zurich samples), or by centrifugation (4,863 xg for 30 minutes, Lausanne
and ski resort samples). Clarified samples were then concentrated using centrifugal filter
units (Centricon Plus-70 Ultrafilter, 10kDa, Millipore, USA) by centrifugation at 3,000xg for 30
minutes. The resulting concentrate (up to 280 µL) was extracted in its entirety using the
QiaAmp Viral RNA MiniKit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
adapted to the larger volumes, and using 80 µL eluent volume. RNA extracts were stored at
-80°C before sequencing.
Sequencing. Frozen cDNA transcripts of RNA extracts from wastewater samples were
analyzed using NGS. Amplicons were produced and libraries prepared according to the
COVID-19 ARTIC v3 protocol ​(R&D 2020)​ and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000
platform, resulting in paired-ends reads of length 250 bp each.
Mutation calling. Mutation calls were produced using V-pipe ​(Posada-Céspedes et al. 2020)​,
a bioinformatics pipeline for end-to-end analysis of viral sequencing reads obtained from
mixed samples. Low-frequency mutation calling was based on local haplotype reconstruction
with ShoRAH ​(Zagordi et al. 2010a, 2010b, 2011; McElroy et al. 2013; Posada-Céspedes et
al. 2020)​. Custom scripts were used for detecting nearby co-occurring mutations in the
multiple read alignments.
Mutation reporting and testing. Samples from the same location were grouped by sampling
date into those collected before October 23, 2020, or afterwards. The cut-off date was
chosen to ensure that the earlier samples were (likely) taken before the emergence of the
B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 variants. Fisher's exact test was applied to test the null hypothesis that
the total number of signature mutation observations is independent of sampling time.
Contingency tables were obtained by counting in each group the number of times the
signature mutations were observed to be present versus absent in the two groups. Missing
observations were omitted from the test. The analysis was performed separately for the
B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 signature mutations.

Results
The B.1.1.7 lineage is defined by 17 signature events (called mutations for simplicity),
including 13 point mutations, 1 three-nucleotide change, and 3 deletions of length 3, 6, and 9
nucleotides each. The 501.V2 lineage is defined by 12 signature mutations, all of which are
single point mutations (Table 1). The two lineages share one mutation, namely A23063T
giving rise to the amino acid change N501Y in the spike protein. In order to interpret the
observation of any of these signature mutations in wastewater samples, we first characterize

the mutational background distribution in Switzerland by analyzing patient samples not
identified as B.1.1.7 nor 501.V2. Next, we identify signature mutations in wastewater
samples, first individually and then, if possible, in combination.

Signature mutations in patient samples
We first assessed the prevalence of signature mutations defining the lineages B.1.1.7 and
501.V2 in all 5192 non-B.1.1.7 and non-501.V2 consensus sequences from GISAID
obtained from clinical samples collected in Switzerland before December 24 (Table 1).
Among the 17 B.1.1.7 signature mutations, seven occurred in patient samples, in total 121
times (2.33%), each in 2 - 90 samples (0.04 - 1.73%). Only two samples displayed
co-occurrence of two mutations, namely (C23604A, C23709T), and no other co-occurrence
of mutations was displayed. For 501.V2, 9 out of the 12 signature mutations occurred in
patient samples, most of them in only 1 - 8 sequences (0.02 - 0.15%), but A10323G
occurred 28 times (0.54%), C28887T 37 times (0.52%), C1059T 203 times (3.91%), and
G25563T 1174 times (22.61%). Some of these mutations co-occurred in the consensus
sequences as pairs or triplets, namely (C1059T, G25563T, C28887T), (C1059T, A10323G,
G25563T) and (C23664T, G25563T) each co-occurred once, (G25563T, C28887T) seven
times, (A10323G, G25563T) 9 times, and (C1059T, G25563T) 199 times. Overall, in
non-B.1.1.7 and non-501.V2 patient samples from Switzerland, several of the signature
mutations had not been detected at all before December 24 or only in very few samples and
in isolation.

5192 non-B.1.1.7 and non-501.V2 consensus sequences available in GISAID and obtained from

Individual signature mutations in wastewater samples
In order to compare the patient-level findings to the mutations detectable in wastewater
samples at the community level, we collected a total of 48 wastewater samples between July
9 and December 21, 2020, from three different WWTPs in Switzerland. In Lausanne, a total
of 15 samples were taken between November 5 and December 21, in Zurich, 32 samples
were collected between July 9 and December 21, and in the ski resort, one sample was
taken on December 21. From all samples, viral RNA was extracted, DNA libraries prepared,
and subjected to NGS using 2 x 250bp paired-end reads. After quality control, the median
number of reads per sample was 1,269,169. The subsequent read mapping step aligned a
median of 1,098,352 reads per sample, which resulted in a median per-sample median
coverage of 2634.5 reads per position (range 0 ​- 28,958). The overall deep coverage
allowed for calling low-frequency mutations in most samples down to a frequency of about
1/3000 on average.
We first analyzed the wastewater samples collected in Zurich (Figure 1). The 32 samples
from July to late December cover a period before the first documented occurrence of the
strains and a period afterwards when they might have migrated into Swiss communities.
Combining all 32 samples, we find six of the 17 B.1.1.7 signature mutations, with a total of
19 occurrences: a 6bp spike deletion in seven samples, a 9bp Orf1ab deletion in seven
samples, a 3bp N gene substitution in two samples, a 3bp spike deletion in one sample, an
Orf1ab point mutation in one sample, and a spike point mutation in one sample. When
separating the occurrence of mutations before and after October 23 (assuming that the new
lineages were not present in Switzerland before that date), we observe three signature
mutations each occurring in one of the 12 samples before October 23 versus 16 occurrences
of five different mutations in 20 samples after October 23. Association between sampling

time and number of signature mutations was assessed by comparing the number of times
we found evidence for and against signature mutations between the early and the late group
excluding missing data due to low coverage, and did not reach statistical significance (​p​ =
0.093, Fisher’s exact test). For the 12 501.V2 signature mutations, we find six occurring 37
times in total (in 21, 7, 4, 2, 1, and 1 samples), 10 before and 27 after October 23, and a
significant association of their occurrence before versus after October 23 (​p​ = 0.036). The
most prevalent mutation found in every sample after October 23 is the Orf3a mutation
G25563T, which is highly prevalent in the Swiss population at 22.6 % according to GISAID
(Table 1). Stratification of the GISAID data by sampling time, shows that the prevalence of
this mutation increased from 12.6% before October 23 to 34.6% after October 23 in the
population, which matches the trend observed in the wastewater data. Hence, the increase
in frequency in wastewater samples is likely not related to occurrence of the 501.V2 variant,
because among patient samples, few other signature mutations were observed in
combination with G25563T, most frequently the pair (C1059T, G25563T) in only 199 out of
5192 (3.8%) consensus sequences.

(due to lack of sufficient coverage).

As compared to the data from Zurich, the time series data from Lausanne starts later, with
one sample from November 5 and 14 daily samples between December 8 and 21 (Figure 2).
Overall, we find a larger number of signature mutations in the Lausanne samples compared
to the Zurich samples. We observe twelve of the 17 B.1.1.7 signature mutations with a total

of 28 observations across the 15 samples. The four B.1.1.7 mutations observed in Zurich are
among them. For 501.V2, four out of twelve signature mutations occur, with the Orf3a
mutation G25563T being present in all but one sample from Lausanne. For comparison, the
same point mutation was found in Zurich in 2 out of 12 samples before and in all 19 samples
after October 23 which had coverage at this position.

(due to lack of sufficient coverage).

Finally, the sample from the ski resort is striking: here, we detected 10 out of the 17 B.1.1.7
mutations and one of the 12 501.V2 mutations (Figure 3). Given the patient background
frequencies of individual mutations (Table 1), many of which are zero for the B.1.1.7 variant,
and the very few combinations of at most three of them that were observed previously, it
seems likely that the B.1.1.7 strain, which was first detected in patient samples from Geneva
of December 22, was present in the December 21 wastewater sample.

In summary, the comparative analysis of individual signature mutations in both patient
samples and in community wastewater samples showed their consistency and provided
some indication for the presence of B.1.1.7 in a sample from the ski resort of December 21.

collected in a Swiss ski resort on December 21, 2020. Blue color shading encodes the estimated
frequency of mutations detected in the sample and pink indicates absence of the mutation.

Co-occurrence of signature mutations in wastewater samples
Some of the signature mutations analyzed above are located in close proximity to each other
on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this case, in addition to detecting individual mutations
independently, co-occurring mutations can be observed directly on the same sequencing
read or read pair coming from the same amplicon produced by the ARTIC v3 protocol.
Specifically, we analyzed two regions on amplicons 92 and 93 which contain three and two
B.1.1.7-defining mutations, respectively, and two 501.V2-specific mutations on amplicon 76
(Table 2). Co-occurrence of mutations provides higher confidence in the presence of the
respective strain, as both independent biological generation and technical artifacts are much
less likely to produce such mutational patterns. To validate this approach, we first searched
for the patterns in two B.1.1.7-positive and two 501.V2-positive control patient samples and
indeed detected co-occurrence of the respective B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 mutations (Table 2, last
four rows). In addition, all patient and wastewater samples that we analyzed displayed, as
expected, on amplicon 77 the A23403G signature mutation of the B.1 lineage, which is the
most prevalent lineage (>99%) in Switzerland at the time of sampling ​(Alm et al. 2020;
Stange et al. 2020)​.

two or more B.1.1.7 or 501.V2 signature mutations observable on individual read pairs were
analyzed. The first column indicates the sample date and location, or ID. Columns 2-5 are labeled
with the respective genomic region and the signature mutations it contains and show the number of
amplicons with all signature mutations present simultaneously, (separated by a dash) the total
coverage by single amplicons, and the fraction of co-occurring mutant reads. Column five reports the
signature mutation of lineage B.1, as a control. All wastewater samples were included with at least
0.1% of all amplicons and at least 5 read pairs carrying all signature mutations in at least one of the
regions. The first 5 rows show wastewater samples labeled by date and location. The last four rows
contain patient samples known to derive from the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages, respectively, as
positive controls.

In the wastewater sample from the ski resort of December 21, which, as reported above,
shows a high prevalence of individual B.1.1.7 mutations, we found co-occurrence of the
three B.1.1.7 signature mutations C27972T, G28048T, and A28111G on amplicon 92 in 514
out of 3689 reads (13.93%), but no reads from amplicon 93 with the two B.1.1.7 mutations

A28111G and GAT28280CTA. Nevertheless, the large fraction of triple-mutated amplicon-92
reads indicates the presence of the B.1.1.7 lineage, consistent with reports of British tourists
staying in the geographic region around the ski resort covered by the WWTP. We analyzed
an additional four samples from Lausanne of December 9, 11, 14, and 21 that displayed
some of the individual mutations. We found co-occurrences of the following B.1.1.7 signature
mutations: two samples carried the signature combination (C27972T, G28048T, A28111G)
on 1.09% and 1.14% of reads from amplicon 92, and two samples displayed the signature
pair (A28111G, GAT28280CTA) on 2.28% and 2.74% of reads from amplicon 93.
To put the wastewater co-occurrence observations into the context of the background
mutation distribution, in the GISAID patient consensus sequences (Table 1), we did not
observe any co-occurrence of these signature mutations neither for the B.1.1.7 nor 501.V2
lineages. However, among the 5192 consensus sequences, mutation C27972T alone
occurred in a total of 7 (0.13%) samples, 2 of them from the canton Zurich (1: 2020-08-20, 1:
2020-08-21), 4 from Berne (1: 2020-11-23, 1: 2020-12-06, 2: 2020-12-14) and one from
Thurgau (2020-11-30), but never in co-occurrence with ​G28048T or A28111G​. ​The signature
mutation G23012A from the 501.V2 lineage only occurred twice in GISAID patient samples,
namely in samples from Basel-Land (1: 2020-03-21) and Vaud (1: 2020-09-30). Mutation
A23063T ​was never observed ​in any of the 5192 Swiss patients​. Hence, the co-occurrences
found in the wastewater samples (Table 2) cannot be explained by the background mutation
distribution. They may have either been generated recently ​de novo​ or be the result of
incomplete sampling of the genomes of B.1.1.7 viruses in the wastewater samples. Given
that 5 out of 61 samples (all sampled in mid or late December, at the suspected time of
B.1.1.7 occurrence) display these co-occurrence patterns and the high prevalence of
individual B.1.1.7 signature mutations in the December-21 ski resort sample, it seems more
likely that the B.1.1.7 variant was present in the four samples from Lausanne and the one
sample from the ski resort.

Conclusion
The preliminary analysis of deep sequencing data from 48 community wastewater samples
collected between July and December 2020 in Switzerland has identified several of the
signature mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineage in several of the samples. In
five samples, one dating as early as December 9, we have found up to three co-occurring
B.1.1.7 signature mutations. These co-occurrences have not been observed in any clinical
samples and hence any known circulating strains until December 24. This observation may
be explained either by an unobserved new strain in Switzerland which is not part of B.1.1.7,
or by B.1.1.7 having circulated already in the first part of December in Switzerland. Given
that B.1.1.7 was identified first in Switzerland in a sample dated December 22 and none of
the non-B.1.1.7 clinical samples carry the co-occurring mutations, the latter explanation
appears more likely suggesting that the B.1.1.7 lineage was present in Switzerland already
in early December.
We have also observed an increase in the number of individual signature mutations in
wastewater samples after October in Zurich, consistent with the same trend in clinical
samples. When analyzing mutations independently, only the December-21 ski resort finding

with 10 out of 17 B.1.1.7 signature mutations provided some indication for the presence of
this strain. By contrast, the co-occurrence analysis appears to be more powerful in detecting
the new strains, owing to the genomic location of some of the signature mutations on the
same amplicon.
Additional work is required to assess the sensitivity and specificity of both approaches in
detecting new genomic variants. Although NGS data from mixed samples can only provide
indirect evidence for the presence of a lineage and not a definite proof, wastewater-based
SARS-CoV-2 genomics may support epidemiology by providing timely, inexpensive,
non-invasive, unbiased community-level samples. Close-mesh time series data are
particularly informative, not only for detailed monitoring of circulating lineages, but also for
increased accuracy in detecting genomic alterations.
