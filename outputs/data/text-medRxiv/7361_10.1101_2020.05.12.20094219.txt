Abstract
Background: There is insufficient evidence to support clinical decision-making for
cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 due to the lack of large studies.
Methods: We used data from a single large UK Cancer Centre to assess
demographic/clinical characteristics of 156 cancer patients with a confirmed COVID19 diagnosis between 29 February-12 May 2020. Logistic/Cox proportional hazards
models were used to identify which demographic and/or clinical characteristics were
associated with COVID-19 severity/death.
Results: 128 (82%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 28 (18%) with
severe disease. Initial diagnosis of cancer >24m before COVID-19 (OR:1.74 (95%CI:
0.71-4.26)), presenting with fever (6.21 (1.76-21.99)), dyspnoea (2.60 (1.00-6.76)),
gastro-intestinal symptoms (7.38 (2.71-20.16)), or higher levels of CRP (9.43 (0.73121.12)) were linked with greater COVID-19 severity. During median follow-up of
47d, 34 patients had died of COVID-19 (22%). Asian ethnicity (3.73 (1.28-10.91),
palliative treatment (5.74 (1.15-28.79), initial diagnosis of cancer >24m before (2.14
(1.04-4.44), dyspnoea (4.94 (1.99-12.25), and increased CRP levels (10.35 (1.0552.21)) were positively associated with COVID-19 death. An inverse association was
observed with increased levels of albumin (0.04 (0.01-0.04).
Conclusions: A longer-established diagnosis of cancer was associated with
increasing severity of infection as well as COVID-19 death, possibly reflecting effects
of more advanced malignant disease impact on this infection. Asian ethnicity and
palliative treatment were also associated with COVID-19 death in cancer patients.

Contribution to the field
In the context of cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decisionmaking. These are supported by limited evidence with small case studies being
reported from China, Italy, New York and a recent consortium of 900 patients from
over 85 hospitals in the USA, Canada, and Spain. As a result of their limited sample
sizes, most studies were not able to distinguish between the effects of age, cancer,
and other comorbidities on COVID-19 outcomes. Moreover, the case series from
New York analysed which patient characteristics are associated with COVID-19
death, but only made a comparison with non-cancer patients. The first results of the
COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium provide insights from a large cohort in terms of
COVID-19 mortality, though a wide variety of institutions with different COVID-19
testing procedures were included.
Given the current lack of (inter)national guidance for cancer patients in the context of
COVID-19, we believe that our large cancer centre can provide an important
contribution to the urgent need for further insight into the intersection between
COVID-19 and cancer. With comprehensive in-house patient details, consistent
inclusion criteria and up-to-date cancer and COVID-19 outcomes, we are in position
to provide rapid analytical information to the oncological community.

Introduction
In the context of cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decisionmaking (1, 2). Patient visits to the cancer clinic increase potential risk of infection
when the alternative is self-isolation at home, and some cancer treatments may
predispose patients to moderate or severe harmful effects of COVID-19 (3, 4).
Current precautionary management decisions being made for cancer patients are
based on assumptions supported by limited evidence, based on small case series
from China and Italy (5-13) and larger series from New York (14, 15) and a recent
consortium of 900 patients from over 85 hospitals in the USA, Canada, and Spain
(16). As a result of their limited sample sizes, most studies were not able to
distinguish between the effects of age, cancer, and other comorbidities on COVID-19
outcomes in this population (17, 18). Moreover, the case series from New York
analysed which patient characteristics are associated with COVID-19 death, but only
made a comparison with non-cancer patients (14, 15). The first results of the COVID19 and Cancer Consortium provide insights from a large cohort in terms of COVID19 mortality, though a wide variety of institutions with different COVID-19 testing
procedures were included (16). In addition, recently published prognostic studies in
COVID-19 positive patients have been judged to be at high risk of bias, mainly due
to non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not
experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model
overfitting, and limited information on model building strategies used (19).

It can be difficult to confidently diagnose COVID-19 symptoms in cancer patients, as
presenting features of the infection are often similar to cancer symptoms and
treatment-related adverse events (17, 20). This may result in a delayed or missed

COVID-19 diagnosis, which could lead to confounding of case and infection mortality
rates, as well as late interventions for more life-threatening disease (21). In addition,
COVID-19 may be a barrier to dignified and humane end-of-life cancer care (17).
Finally, the pandemic is causing huge service reconfiguration for both curative and
palliative oncology care, resulting in fewer clinic visits due to social distancing (22),
cessation of screening, and delays or changes in treatments that will inevitably have
serious impacts on cancer-related mortality and morbidity (17, 21). Our recent
systematic review reported there is currently no definitive evidence that specific
cytotoxic drugs are contraindicated in cancer patients infected with COVID-19 (23).

Larger studies with multivariate models are urgently warranted to further explore this
intersection of COVID-19 and cancer in terms of clinical outcomes, so as to inform
oncological care during this outbreak and potential future pandemics (24). Guy’s
Cancer Centre in South-East London, which treats approximately 8,800 patients
annually, including 4,500 new diagnoses, is one of the largest Comprehensive
Cancer Centres in the UK and is currently at the epicentre of the UK COVID-19
epidemic.

Methods
Study population
Guy’s Cancer Cohort, a research ethics committee approved research database
(Reference number: 18/NW/0297) of all routinely collected clinical data of cancer
patients at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT), forms the basis of
this observational study (25). The database contains routinely collected prospective

and retrospective demographic/clinical data on all cancer patients treated at Guy’s
Cancer Centre. We have an established clinical database for all cancer patients
tested for COVID-19 either in outpatient clinics or ward setting since 29 February
2020. Using the unique hospital number, these databases were merged prior to
anonymization for research purposes. We assessed outcomes included in the core
outcome sets currently being developed for COVID-19 to ensure all relevant
information is collected in our COVID specific database (26).

We have included cancer patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19, from a
positive PCR test, from 29th February-12th May 2020. Until 30 April 2020, a COVID19 test was ordered for cancer patients if they presented with symptoms
necessitating hospitalization or if they were scheduled to undergo a cancer-related
treatment. From 1 May 2020, COVID-19 testing was introduced as part of standard
care, with about 25% of patients being swabbed daily depending on staff and testing
kit availability. A total of 1,507 patients were tested between 29 February and 12
May 2020, of whom 156 had COVID-19 (10%).

Statistical methods
In this analysis of our data, we had three aims:
1) To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 positive
cancer patients, in terms of their COVID-19 and cancer diagnoses.
2) To identify which demographic and/or clinical factors were associated with
COVID-19 severity in cancer patients.
3) To identify which demographic and/or clinical factors were associated with
COVID-19 death in cancer patients.

Descriptive statistics were used to address the first aim. Most variables had several
categories for the purpose of these descriptive analyses, but were collapsed for the
purpose of regression analyses due to the sample size of our cohort. Socioeconomic status (low, middle, high) was determined based on the English Indices of
Multiple Deprivation for postcodes (27). Lymphocyte count (x109) was categorized as

≤0.5, 0.6-0.8, 0.9-1.2, and >1.2 based on the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events v.5 (CTCAE). For the other laboratory variables, we created tertiles
instead of clinical cut-offs due to cancer patients already having abnormal values for
most of these blood markers (Ferritin, C-reactive protein, and albumin). Radical
treatment was defined as those patients with a chance of long-term survival or cure.

For the second aim, we conducted logistic regression analyses. Mild/moderate
COVID-19 was defined as pneumonia with or without sepsis (i.e. those patients
managed on the ward), whereas severe COVID-19 was defined as acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) or septic shock (i.e. those patients where severity
reaches criteria for Intensive Care Unit admission, if deemed clinically appropriate).
These definitions were based on the WHO COVID-19 classification (28). The models
used to quantify the association between each factor and COVID-19 severity were
defined through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (Figure 1 in Appendix). Each factor
was individually set as the main exposure variable in the model in order to determine
the minimal adjustments required for each factor (Table 1 in Appendix).

The third research aim was addressed with Cox proportional hazards regression
analyses, whereby the models were defined as above (Table 1 in Appendix). Followup was defined from date of COVID testing until death or 12 May 2020.

All statistical analyses were conducted with STATA version 15.1.

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 positive cancer patients
128 patients (82%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 28 patients (18%)
with severe COVID-19 (Table 1). More patients were male (58%) and aged 60+
(68%; median age: 67). However, 14% of the cancer population was aged <50 years
(n=21; median age: 41). When stratified by COVID grade, more male cancer patients
presented with severe disease (68%). Most patients were from a lower socioeconomic background (81%). With respect to ethnicity, about half were White, 22%
were Black (n=32) and 4% were of Asian (n=6) origin. When stratified by COVID
grade, a slightly larger proportion of patients from a white ethnic background had
severe COVID (57%). Hypertension was the most reported comorbidity (47%),
followed by diabetes mellitus (22%), renal impairment (19%) and cardiovascular
disease (19%). However, benign lung conditions were more commonly reported for
those who presented with severe COVID-19 (29% vs 13% in those with mild COVID19).

The most frequently reported tumour types were urological/gynaecological (29%),
followed by haematological (18%) and breast (15%) (Table 2). The first group (n=45)
comprised 21 prostate, 8 renal, 5 bladder and 11 gynaecological cancers. Of the 28
haematological malignancies, 4 (14.3%) were myeloid and 24 (85.7%) were
lymphoid. Of all cancer patients tested for COVID-19, 80 were positive after their
cancer-related hospital admission (51%), of which 61 were solid tumours (76%) and

19 were haematological cancers (24%). When stratified by COVID-19 severity, the
largest proportion of cancers presenting with severe COVID were haematological
(36%). A large proportion of patients had advanced cancer (40% stage IV) and were
diagnosed with their malignancy in the last 12 months (46%).

Overall, 39% of patients were receiving palliative treatment, 25% were receiving
radical treatment and 12% were treatment naive. Treatment distributions were
reasonably comparable between COVID-19 severity groups. Of the 81 patients on
systemic treatment within the last 2 years, 54 were in a palliative setting, of these
50% were 1st line, 33% 2nd line and 13% on ≥3rd treatment line. However, the
majority of severe COVID-19 patients were on third line metastatic treatment. Table
2 provides further details on the cancer characteristics.

46% of the cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in this cohort presented with a
cough and 52% had a fever. Most patients were molecularly diagnosed within 7 days
of their initial symptoms (58%) (Table 3). More patients in the severe COVID-19
group presented with C-reactive protein (CRP) values in the highest tertile (46 vs
22% for mild/moderate disease). Similarly, they had a lower lymphocyte count (53 vs
21% in the lowest category (≤0.5)) and lower albumin levels (39 vs 22% in the lowest
tertile).

Factors associated with COVID-19 severity in cancer patients
The odds ratios (ORs) for the associations between the various demographic and
clinical factors and COVID-19 severity status are shown in Table 4. There was a
non-statistically significant indication that those patients who were diagnosed with

cancer more than 24 months ago were at a higher risk of presenting with severe
COVID-19 as compared to those diagnosed during the last 24 months (OR: 1.74
(95%CI:0.71-4.26)). With respect to symptom presentation, those presenting with a
fever, dyspnoea, or gastro-intestinal symptoms were at a higher risk of having
severe COVID-19 as compared to those without these symptoms (OR: 6.21 (1.7621.99), 2.60 (1.00-6.76), and 7.38 (2.71-20.16), respectively).

Factors associated with COVID-19 death in cancer patients
During a median follow-up of 37 days (IQR:18-49), 34 cancer patients had died of
COVID-19 (22%) (Table 5). Several cancer patient characteristics were found to be
positively associated with risk of COVID-19 death: Asian ethnicity (as compared to
white - HR: 3.73 (95%CI: 1.28-10.91), receiving palliative treatment (as compared to
no active treatment - HR: 5.74 (95%CI: 1.15-28.79), time since cancer diagnosis
>24 months (as compared to ≤24 months - HR: 2.14 (95%CI: 1.04-4.44), presenting
with dyspnoea (as compared to no dyspnoea – HR: 4.94 (95%CI: 1.99-12.25), and
high CRP levels (3rd tertile vs 1st tertile – HR: 10.35 (95%CI: 1.05-52.21)). In
addition, an inverse association with death from COVID-19 was observed with levels
normal albumin levels (3rd tertile vs 1st tertile – HR: 0.04 (95%CI: 0.01-0.042).

Discussion
Using multivariate modelling based on a directed acyclic graph, this study reports on
a large cohort of COVID-19 positive cancer patients from a single institution. Low
SES, hypertension and diabetes were common in cancer patients with COVID-19.
Age, sex, ethnicity, SES, and current cancer treatment were found to not be

associated with severity of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. However, receipt
of a cancer diagnosis more than 24 months previously (as compared to within 24
months) and presenting with fever, dyspnoea, or gastro-intestinal symptoms were
linked with higher odds of developing severe illness as compared to mild/moderate
COVID-19. Higher levels of CRP and ferritin were also associated with more severe
COVID-19 disease in infected cancer patients. During a median follow-up of 37 days,
the following cancer patient characteristics were found to be positively associated
with COVID-19 death: Asian ethnicity, palliative treatment, initial cancer diagnosis
>24 months, dyspnoea at presentation and high CRP levels. Normal serum albumin
levels were inversely associated with death from COVID-19 in cancer patients.

Demographic and cancer characteristics
Several retrospective cohort studies published using data from hospitals situated in
Wuhan, China, Northern Italy, Canada and the USA have reported on the clinical
characteristics of COVID-19 positive cancer patients with sample sizes varying from
9 to 85, two slightly larger series of >200 patients, and a big data Consortium
including over 85 institutions resulting in 900 patients (5-12, 16). The median age
reported in these studies was similar to our study, with a range from 63 to 72 years.
A larger proportion of male patients has been observed. Lung cancer was the most
commonly reported cancer in the Zhang (5), Yu (8), Yang (10) and Stroppa (11)
studies, but only accounted for 11% in our patient population. Zhang et al. (5)
estimated that in their cohort 29% of patients tested positive for COVID-19 following
hospital admission, whereas this was estimated at 51% in our cohort. Interpretation
of this statistic is difficult given the latency between exposure and manifestations of
infection, meaning patients diagnosed after admission may have been infected

outside hospital. Several studies (6, 10) noted that hypertension, diabetes and
coronary heart disease were the commonly reported comorbidities.

Our cancer cohort is similar in distribution of age, sex, and comorbidities to the case
series reported to date. The ethnicity and SES of our COVID-19 positive cancer
patients are most likely a reflection of the catchment area of our Cancer Centre in
South-East London (29), covering more deprived Boroughs (Lambeth and
Southwark). Based on the number of cancer patients treated at our Cancer Centre in
2019, about 49% of patients are of a White ethnic background. Variations observed
with the published data in terms of cancer type, stage, and treatment may be a
reflection of clinical practice (e.g. intensity of treatment and frequency of hospital
visits), of relative cancer incidence, or of extent of treatment changes introduced as
mitigation in the face of the emerging pandemic. For example, the most recently
reported age-standardized lung cancer incidence rates for males and females in
Wuhan are 54.1 and 19.1 per 100,000, whereas these are estimated to be 37.5 and
24.3 per 100,000 in London (30). Early modification and prioritization of treatment
was introduced at our centre, in accordance with now-published guidance (31).

COVID-19 characteristics and severity
Comparably to our study, both the Zhang and the Du studies also reported fever,
cough, shortness of breath and dyspnea as common clinical features (5, 6). As in the
Chinese cohort of 85 fatal cases, our severe COVID-19 patients had comparable
laboratory findings: decreased lymphocytes, increased CRP, and decreased albumin
(6).

Severe events were reported for 54% of the study population and mortality for 29%
in the Zhang study, as compared to 18% and 22% in our cohort. Zhang et al. also
reported that recent treatment within 14 days was associated with an increased risk
of developing severe events (28 days) (5). This difference with our observations may
be attributed to different definitions of severe events, as it was not entirely clear how
these were defined by Zhang et al. As highlighted by Wynants et al in their
assessment of current statistical models published for COVID-19 (19), there is a
need for consistent use of outcome definitions. However, our observations of a
positive association with CRP levels is in line with most COVID-19 studies published
to date (32). Apart from the CCC-19 Consortium (16), no study to date has
specifically looked at COVID-19 severity at presentation in COVID-19 positive cancer
patients and hence our observation of an association with time since cancer
diagnosis and presenting symptoms needs further validation in other large cohorts
with homogenous definitions of inclusion criteria, testing strategies, and outcomes
measures. However, it is possible that time since cancer diagnosis is also a
reflection of extent of disease and progression along the palliative patient pathway
from diagnosis to death.

COVID-19 death
The study by Yu et al. reported three deaths (25%) (8). In the larger series from New
York, Mehta et al reported an overall case fatality rate of 28%, with 37% for
haematological malignancies and 25% for solid tumours (14). The CCC-19
Consortium reported a 30-day mortality rate due to COVID-19 of 13% (16). In our
cohort the overall case fatality rate was 22%, with 25% for haematological cancers
and 21% for solid tumours. As more than 85 institutions were included in the CCC-19

Consortium (16), it is possible that differences in COVID-19 practice as well as
cancer treatments between the numerous centres may explain the slightly lower
death rate as compared to reports of single centre study. Moreover, our median
follow-up is 37 days as compared to 21 days for the Consortium. The heterogeneity
between centres may also explain why performance status was found to be
associated with COVID-19 outcomes, an observation not identified in our single
centre cohort.

Our observations of Asian ethnicity being associated with increased mortality from
COVID-19 in cancer patients is of interest, given the recent speculations about the
disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on Black, Asian and minority ethnic
communities (33) as well as the confounding factor of vitamin D deficiency (34).
However, longer follow-up studies are required to disentangle the association
between ethnicity and COVID-19 death in cancer patients

Strengths and limitations
Whilst this is one of the largest single centre COVID-19 positive cancer cohorts to
date, our sample size is still relatively modest and hence confidence intervals for
some statistically significant observations are still wide. No firm conclusions in terms
of prognostic modelling can be drawn as of yet (19). Current analyses were aimed at
hypothesis generation about patient or tumour characteristics indicative of severity of
or death from COVID-19 in the cancer context. Our data for some of the patient
characteristics is limited, for example smoking status was missing for 29% of
patients and hence likely underestimates the proportion of ever smokers. COVID
testing in the UK has only been implemented gradually during the period of our data

collection, and there is selection bias in favour of patients being tested as inpatients.
Our analysis is likely to have missed cancer outpatients under our care diagnosed
with COVID-19 at other hospitals – however this is most likely to be an even more
important issue for global Consortia with many hospitals only adding a few cases to
the overall dataset. It is a strength of our study that we used clearly defined
definitions of COVID-19 severity, as well as a DAG to develop the different models,
as to date very limited knowledge is available regarding the intersection between
COVID-19 and cancer (19). Detailed information on our modelling will help
comparison with future studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up.

Conclusion
Our analysis of one of the largest single centre series of COVID-19 positive cancer
patients to date confirms a similar distribution of age, sex, and comorbidities as
reported for other populations. Reflecting the general population, presenting with
fever, dyspnoea, or gastro-intestinal symptoms, higher levels of CRP or ferritin were
also indicators of COVID-19 severity in the cancer population. Similarly, we noted
that dyspnoea at presentation, high CRP levels, and low levels of albumin were
associated with death from COVID-19. With respect to cancer specific observations,
patients who have lived longer with their cancer were found to be more susceptible
to a greater infection severity, possibly reflecting the effect of more advanced
malignant disease, as almost half of the severe cohort were on third line metastatic
treatment, or the impact of this infection. The latter was also found to be associated
with COVID-19 death in cancer patients, as were Asian ethnicity and palliative
treatment. Further validation will be provided from other large case series, as well as
