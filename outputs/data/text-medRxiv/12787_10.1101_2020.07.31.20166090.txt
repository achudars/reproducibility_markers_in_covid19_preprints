The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic is claiming
human lives and disrupting the functioning of human societies in unprecedented ways. Where did
this virus come from and how did it transmit to humans? What facilitated such a host shift and
how can we prevent this from happening again? These are important questions, in addition to the
most outstanding ones about whether, when, and how this pandemic will end.

Recent years have seen a rise in the recorded number of epidemics from emerging diseases. Such
epidemics constitute a major public health threat because of our limited knowledge of prevention
and treatment therapies. Most emerging infectious diseases originate from pathogen spillovers
from wildlife to humans (1). Why are such outbreaks increasing? Does environmental change play
a role?

Crucial to understanding the emergence of infectious diseases is the analysis of the factors
facilitating the spillover from wildlife prior to further spread within human populations (2,3). In
the case of SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic sequencing has shown that the virus is most closely related
(~96%) to a strain present in horseshoe bats (4). It is still unclear whether the spillover of SARS‐
CoV‐2 occurred directly from bats to humans or through an intermediate species. For instance, a
strain of coronavirus very similar to SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in Malayan Pangolin (Manis
javanica) (5), a wild mammal that is frequently illegally smuggled from Southeast Asia into China
and sold in markets (5). Regardless of the specific pathway, the pathogen flow of emerging
zoonotic diseases to humans is the result of human interactions with wildlife. We argue that the
increasing incidence of emerging disease outbreaks is the result of a similar set of drivers able to
change the distance and contact rates between wildlife and humans (as well as human‐human
interaction), including population growth, urbanization, increasing affluence in mid‐income
countries, and the associated dietary shifts (6). As countries become more affluent demand for
animal products increases, leading to an expansion of agriculture and animal husbandry, often at
the expense of natural ecosystems (7). Human penetration in wildlife habitat favors the
interaction between humans and wildlife species, either directly through activities like hunting or
through other species, particularly livestock that are in closer contact with humans (8‐11). The
establishment of pastures, plantations or concentrated livestock farms close to forest margins
may increase pathogen flows from wildlife to humans (2,9,11‐14). Indeed, deforestation and
2

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) causing
coronaviruses are mostly discovered in Asian horseshoe bats. It is still unclear how ongoing land
use changes may facilitate SARS‐related coronavirus transmission to humans. Here we use a
multivariate hotspot analysis of high‐resolution land‐use data to show that regions of China
populated by horseshoe bats are hotspots of forest fragmentation, livestock and human density.
We also identify areas susceptible to new hotspot emergence in response to moderate expansion
of urbanization, livestock production, or forest disturbance, thereby highlighting regions
vulnerable to SARS‐CoV spillover under future land‐use change. In China population growth and
increasing meat consumption associated with urbanization and economic development have
expanded the footprint of agriculture, leading to human encroachment in wildlife habitat and
increased livestock density in areas adjacent to fragmented forests. The reduced distance
between horseshoe‐bats and humans elevates the risk for SARS‐related coronavirus transmission
to humans.

to the extinction of habitat specialist species, while allowing generalists to thrive (15).

While several reports in the media have conjectured on a possible link between land use change
and the emergence of the COVID19 pandemic, such a hypothesis still has to be supported by a
comprehensive high‐resolution analysis of land use patterns that combines forest fragmentation
to livestock and human encroachment in wildlife habitat (2). Here we analyze environmental
changes to explain why China remains at risk for other SARS‐related coronavirus outbreaks (1,2).
We analyze a set of factors that could make China a suitable location for the spillover to humans
to occur. To that end, while we do not specifically link environmental change or bats as the
immediate hosts of the SARS‐CoV‐2 ancestor (4,5), we use horseshoe bats in the genus
Rhinolophus (family Rhinolophidae) as a model system to understand the risk of future
coronavirus outbreaks because China is reported to be a region with both highly diverse
horseshoe bats and bat SARS‐like CoV (16‐18).

Among the four CoV genera, two (alpha‐ and betacoronaviruses) are found in bats. Among the
betacoronaviruses, all four subgenera have been discovered in bats, including the SARS‐related
CoVs (SARSr‐CoV, subgenera Sarbecovirus) (16‐18). Both SARS‐CoV‐1 and Swine acute diarrhoea
syndrome coronavirus (SADS‐CoV) emerged in southeast China and were later detected in
horseshoe bats, mainly Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis (4,16‐18). Most SARSr‐CoVs
are detected in horseshoe bats, although some strains have been detected in other genera. SARSr‐
CoVs in China are most similar to the highly pathogenic human SARS‐CoVs (4,16‐18). Therefore,
we performed our local analyses of disturbance at bat locations to horseshoe bats in China (Fig
1a; Table S1) and our analyses of disturbance within horseshoe bat distributions in both the larger
South, East, and South East Asia region and then China.

Within these distributions we generated 10000 random sampling points (Fig 1a, see SI). Within
30km from every random sampling point we calculate livestock density (n/km2), forest cover and
fragmentation, cropland cover, population density, and the fractional cover of human settlements
(see Supplementary Materials) (14). Hotspots were calculated (Fig 1a) using the Getis‐Ord
algorithm to show the areas with high or low values of land use attributes cluster (Fig 2).

China exhibits a relatively high concentration of livestock production in horseshoe bat
distributions (Fig 1a, Table S1). Indeed, China is a hotspot of livestock density within this region
(Fig 1b), with statistically significant higher concentrations of chickens, ducks, pigs, goats and
cattle (Fig 2a). Within a 30km radius from observed bat locations the density of chicken, ducks,
pigs, goats, and cattle was again significantly greater than randomly selected locations.
Conversely the sheep density is lower in China, though sheep density was low overall, as it was
for other ruminants. The density of chickens, pigs, goats and cattle surrounding (<30km) the
points where these bats were recorded and at the randomly selected locations in China within
the suitability region were not significantly different, indicating that these random locations have
livestock densities that are representative of the areas in which the actual presence of horseshoe
bats has been documented.

Forest cover and fragmentation have been related to virus outbreaks from wildlife (including bats)
for other zoonotic diseases such as Ebola virus disease (14). China exhibits on average lower forest
cover and cropland density and greater forest fragmentation than the other regions analyzed (Fig

1c). The average forest cover and forest fragmentation in the surroundings (within 30km distance)
of random points selected in China and the other regions (Figs 1a, 2b) show that these differences
are statistically significant. Likewise, statistically significant differences (i.e. lower average cover
and higher average fragmentation) are found between the points of actual observations of
horseshoe bats and randomly selected locations in the regions outside China within the
distributions of these bats (Fig 2b).

China also exhibits higher levels of human presence in horseshoe bat distributions, as evidenced
by population density and the fraction of the landscape covered by villages, towns, and other
human settlement (Fig 2c). Indeed, the region of China suitable for horseshoe bats coincides with
hotspots of human settlements (Fig 1d). Collectively, these results demonstrate that China
exhibits stronger signs of human encroachment, livestock density, and forest disturbance of
SARSr‐CoV hosting horseshoe bat distributions than other regions. In China, regions close to forest
fragments are more densely used for livestock production and human settlements – and
consequently exhibit lower forest and cropland cover (Fig 1b) – thereby favoring the contact
between wildlife and humans either directly or through intermediate animals such as livestock.
The fact that China is a global hotspot in the concurrence of these three factors (fragmentation,
livestock density, and human settlement) is highlighted by the multivariate hotspot analysis (Fig.
3). These three attributes account for bat habitat (fragmentation), livestock, and human presence,
which are major factors contributing to the spillover of zoonotic infectious diseases. Interestingly,
we find that China is the global hotspot of simultaneously high forest fragmentation, livestock
density and human settlement. The other major global hotspots outside China are found in Java,
Bhutan, east Nepal, northern Bangladesh, the Kerala state of India and North‐East India, the latter
of which are known for past outbreaks of Nipah virus, another bat‐related zoonotic disease (19).

We then use the multivariate hotspot framework to identify regions at high potential risk of
SARSr‐CoVs spillovers to humans as a result of land use change. To that end the results of the
multivariate hotspot analysis were clustered in 30 groups, based on geographic contiguity and
similarity in the above three attributes (Fig. 4a; Table S3). We then perturbed one attribute at a
time in each group to evaluate that group’s susceptibility to transitioning from non‐significant
conditions (Fig. 3) to a hotspot state (Fig. 4b). This sensitivity analysis (Fig 4b) shows areas at risk
of transitioning to hotspots as a result of a future increase in at least one of the analyzed attributes
(i.e. forest fragmentation, livestock density, or human settlement). Interestingly the Chinese
region south of Shanghai is at high risk of potentially turning into a hotspot as a result of
fragmentation increase. Other regions susceptible to hotspot transition as a result of forest
fragmentation include Japan and north Philippines. Likewise, the transition region between
China’s hotspot and Indochina’s coldspot and the region surrounding the hotspot of Thailand
could turn into hotspots for SARSr‐CoV spillover as a result of increasing presence of livestock or
humans, respectively (Fig. 4b). These results point both to regions of the world currently suitable
for SARSr‐CoV spillover from wildlife to humans as well as those at risk of becoming prone to
spillover as a result of trajectories of land use change and human penetration (Fig. 4c; Fig.S8 SI)

Our approach uses the horseshoe bats as a model family because of their key role as hosts of

strains of related viruses have been found in other bat genera, but these relationships are less
clear (16‐18). The widespread sampling of other bats may find species‐specific relationships,
though horseshoe bats appear to be the reservoirs where most SARSr‐CoVs have their
evolutionary ancestors so we assume they are the most appropriate model. The risk to humans
from other coronaviruses, therefore, will be different, because their host distributions are
different, and two CoV genera (gamma‐ and delta‐coronaviruses) are mostly bird viruses.

The bat location data and species distribution data also suffer from different, but related issues.
The bat location data are presence only data. True absence data are difficult to obtain, therefore
we randomly sampled within different locations to generate pseudo‐absence data. Choosing
where to sample from also present difficulties, so we chose horseshoe bat distribution data for
species that existed within China, East Asia, South, and South East Asia. This presents further
issues as the distribution of one species, the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum),
extends from Western Europe, Northern Africa, Central Asia and Eastern Asia. We therefore
weighted our sampling based on the number of overlapping species distributions to account for
this. However, these species distributions are large polygons and the realized niches used within
them by the species likely differ, so better niche models using presence and, ideally,
presence/absence data are required to develop better species presence predictions (20).
However, our results for random locations in China and outside China and reported bat
observations were comparable.

More generally, though using the relatively specific bat and virus relationships, we took a high‐
level approach to understand the more distal or ultimate (rather than proximal) causes of
infectious disease emergence in China, linking environmental change and human drivers like
agricultural intensification. Different infectious diseases have different transmission mechanisms
and life cycles, and not all will respond to such changes in the same way. For example, directly
transmitted, acute infections with short incubation and infectious periods, like SARSr‐CoVs, will
likely be dependent on hosts having greater densities, like in China, for them to emerge. The
epidemic potential is then also increased through local and global movement and trade, either of
people, wildlife, or livestock (8,21‐23). Along with the biological properties of the virus and hosts,
the true risk of both the initial cross‐species transmission and epidemic potential is either
increased or limited by more proximal mechanisms, such as biosecurity, health and safety
measures (e.g. personal protective equipment, meat hygiene) that can reduce risk, even if the
ultimate factors are present and increasing through the processes of habitat fragmentation and
human encroachment (8,14).

Spillover of infectious disease such as SARS, COVID‐19 and SADS from wildlife to humans likely
requires the coexistence of horseshoe bats and humans in the same environment and is favored
by the presence of intermediate animal species, particularly livestock because it is in closer
contact with humans. The fragmentation and disturbance of forest ecosystems likely favors
habitat generalist bat species. In particular, chickens, ducks, and pigs have been associated with
the spread of several zoonotic viral infections, such as influenza viruses. This study demonstrates
that in China these important factors responsible for reducing the distance between wildlife and
humans co‐occur both in horseshoe bat distributions and in the surroundings of actual
documented bat occurrence. These results are consistent with the notion that population growth
and increasing meat consumption associated with urbanization and economic growth have
expanded the footprint of agriculture, leading to human encroachment in wildlife habitat and
increased livestock density in areas adjacent to fragmented forest patches. China has dramatically

increased animal consumption (24), likely as the result of increasing affluence. In China, meat
supply is largely reliant on domestic production using imported feed (e.g. soy from the Americas)
(24), which explains the high livestock density in many rural areas, including those at the forest
margins. Likewise, economic growth and the shift to diets richer in animal products explains the
increasing demand for wild animal meat delicacies, increasing human‐wildlife interactions
through multiple pathways and the disturbance of forest habitat in more remote locations –
frequently abroad – through trade‐related teleconnections (25).

The multivariate hotspot analysis highlights how China is the largest hotspot for the concurrence
of high forest fragmentation, livestock density, and human presence in our analysis (Fig. 3). The
sensitivity analyses identifying the possible transition to new hotspots in response to an increase
in one of these attributes (Fig. 4b) highlights areas that could become suitable for spillover and
the type of land use change that could induce hotspot activation. Therefore, this analysis
highlights region‐specific targeted interventions that are urgently needed to increase resilience
to SARSr‐CoV spillovers. For instance, the green dots in Fig. 4 could be turned into hotspots as a
result of forest fragmentation. In these regions resilience can be built through forest conservation
or restoration efforts. Indeed, land use change evaluations should consider the risk of activating
new hotspots suitable for wildlife‐to‐human spillover of pathogens such as SARSr‐CoV, an aspect
that has seldom been included in the impact analysis of land use change. Likewise, other regions
such as the China‐Indochina transition zone or central Thailand are prone to hotspot transitioning
as a result of increased livestock density of urbanization, respectively. In these cases, mitigation
of SARSr‐CoV emergence can been enhanced by reducing livestock or human density,
respectively, thereby inverting ongoing dietary and urbanization trends. Thus, environmental
health, is tightly connected to both animal and human health, as recently stressed by planetary
and ‘one health’ discourses, which advocate for more holistic views of global health,
encompassing environment, animals, and people as well as their interactions (26).

We restricted our local analyses of disturbance at bat locations to Rhinolophid bats in China. We
performed a Web of Science® search on 10/04/2020 using the following Boolean Operators:
Rhinoloph* AND China AND Monitor* OR Survey OR Niche OR Distribution. We found 129 unique
references. We removed all those published before 2000, reporting data outside China, review
articles, and non‐English (specifically 23 Chinese language publication), those with no Rhinolophid
data, and those reporting only fossil records. We kept infection studies. This left 48 publications.
We then further manually reviewed the publications for those reporting location data (22) but
more specifically those with latitude and longitude, leaving 17 publications and 264 observations
(see Fig. 1a; Table S1).

Bat location data
Most SARS‐related CoVs are detected in horseshoe bats, although some strains have also been
detected in other genera (22,27‐33). SARSr‐CoVs in China are most similar to the highly
pathogenic human SARS‐CoVs (34‐36).

Within these putative species distributions, we generated 10000 random sampling points with a
local sampling density that is proportional to the number of species whose distributions were
reported at the point. For every random sampling point we consider a circular area of 30km radius
within which we calculate livestock density, forest cover and fragmentation, cropland cover,
population density and the fractional cover of human settlements as explained below. The
average values of these statistics are then calculated for China and the other regions of the world
with habitat suitable for Rhinolophidae and compared and the difference is tested for significance
using the Mann‐Whitney non‐parametric test in Mathematica©.

(https://livestock.geo‐wiki.org/home‐2/). We quantified human presence both in terms of
population density at 1 km resolution and as fraction of the landscape taken by villages, towns or
other settlements from the WorldPop database at 1 km resolution. We used cropland data (at
30×30m2 resolution) from (37). Forest cover data are available at 30m resolution annually
between 2000 and 2018 (38). Forest cover is associated with the presence of trees taller than 5
m. Forest loss or gain was determined as the difference in forest cover between these two years.

We performed a forest fragmentation analyses based on Vogt et al. (39) using the 30m forest
cover data. This method distinguishes forest cores, from forest margins and patches. Every 30m
pixel is classified as wooded or non‐wooded, based on whether its tree cover was greater or
smaller than 50% in the year 2018. Forest cores are wooded pixels that are not adjacent to non‐
wooded pixels. Conversely, forest patches are made of wooded pixels that are not adjacent to
forest core pixels. Wooded pixels that are neither core nor patch pixels occur at the margins of
forest cores. Forest fragmentation was then quantified in terms of a composite fragmentation
index (CFI) (13), defined as the ratio between the sum of number of pixels classified as “margins”,
“patches”, or smaller core areas (i.e.,<200 ha), and the total number of pixels (wooded + non‐
wooded) in the 30km circles used to characterize land cover and land use in the surroundings of
the points of actual bat observations or the randomly generated points. This index ranges
between 0 and 1.

We mapped statistically significant hotspots of livestock density, forest fragmentation, and
human settlements. To be a hotspot, an area needs to have a high (or low, in the case of cold‐
spots) value of its attribute and be also surrounded by other areas with high (or low) values of the
same attribute. To that end, the 30km circles centered on the 10000 random points (Fig. 1a)
considered in this study were used to carry out a hotspot analysis applying the Getis‐Ord
algorithm (Gi* statistics). The Gi* statistic shows to what extent areas with high or low values tend

We then used two different methods to generate a multivariate distribution for the three
indicators (livestock density, forest fragmentation and human settlements). First, we averaged
their Gi*. Since the Gi* is a z‐score, i.e. it has a standard normal distribution, a linear combination
of the three Gi* indicators, such as their average, is a standard normal distribution and can still
be represented with the same significance levels (Fig. 2). Second, we performed a spatially
constrained multivariate clustering analysis. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from the
connectivity graph of the features was built, and then the SKATER (Spatial “K”luster Analysis by
Tree Edge Removal) clustering method was used (40). The SKATER iteratively cuts branches in the
MST, based on data variability among and within groups and on a spatial constraint, until it
reaches the user‐defined number of groups. The spatial constraint defined here is a k nearest
neighbors type with 8 neighbors, meaning each feature in a group must have at least one of its 8
nearest neighbors in the same group. We chose 30 as the number of groups, calculated a set of
summary statistics and boxplots for the groups and compared them to their global values (Table
S2). For each indicator, we calculated the R2 value as the reduction in variance of the indicator
obtained by grouping, divided by the original variance of the indicator (Table S2). While the
modularity analysis based on pseudo F‐statistics shows that the optimal number of groups (the
maximum differences between groups while maximizing within group similarity) is 12, here we
studied 30 groups to analyse distinct regional patterns. Having a greater number of groups allows
us to identify groups that are susceptible to transitioning to a hotspot because they are not “too
different” from hotspots.

Table S3. Report for the spatially constrained multivariate grouping analysis, showing group
numerosity, descriptive statistics and boxplots, in comparison with the global benchmark. The
share is calculated as the ratio of the variable range (min‐max) which is occupied by the same
variable in a group. Q1 and Q3 are respectively the first and third quartile, and sd is the standard
deviation. The R2 parameter measures the indicator’s performance in grouping the sample, as
relative reduction of the intra‐group variability w.r.t. the global sample variability. Variables
include fragmentation (frg), livestock (lst), and settlements (stl). Boxplots are an intuitive tool to
visually recap statistical distributions. The meaning of the elements of boxplots is described in the
figure below. In the report, the first and third quartile are expressed respectively as Q1 and Q3.
The high number of outliers for livestock and settlements is typical for high‐skewness
distributions. The boxplots show well how the indicator distributions shift and narrow from the
global dataset to single groups. Although in some the standard deviation of one or more indicators
is higher than the global benchmark, each group can be considered as homogeneous for at least
one parameter.
