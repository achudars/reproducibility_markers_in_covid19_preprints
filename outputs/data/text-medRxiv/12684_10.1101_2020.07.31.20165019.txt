Abstract
BACKGROUND: Seroreactivity against human endemic coronaviruses has been linked
to disease severity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assays that are capable of
concomitantly detecting antibodies against endemic coronaviridae such as OC43,
229E, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate this question. We set up a
platform for serum-screening and developed a bead-based Western blot system,
namely DigiWest, capable of running hundreds of assays using microgram amounts
of protein prepared directly from different viruses.
METHODS: The parallelized and miniaturised DigiWest assay was adapted for
detecting antibodies using whole protein extract prepared from isolated SARS-CoV-2
virus particles. After characterisation and optimization of the newly established test,
whole virus lysates of OC43, 229E, and NL63 were integrated into the system.
RESULTS: The DigiWest-based immunoassay system for detection of SARS-CoV-2
specific antibodies shows a sensitivity of 87.2 % and diagnostic specificity of 100 %.
Concordance analysis with the SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays available by Roche,
Siemens, and Euroimmun indicates a comparable assay performance (Cohen’s
Kappa ranging from 0.8799-0.9429). In the multiplexed assay, antibodies against the
endemic coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and NL63 were detected, displaying a high
incidence of seroreactivity against these coronaviruses.
CONCLUSION: The DigiWest-based immunoassay, which uses authentic antigens from
isolated virus particles, is capable of detecting individual serum responses against
SARS-CoV-2 with high specificity and sensitivity in one multiplexed assay. It shows
high concordance with other commercially available serologic assays. The DigiWest
approach enables a concomitant detection of antibodies against different endemic
coronaviruses and will help to elucidate the role of these possibly cross-reactive
antibodies.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly identified
beta coronavirus that crossed the species barrier and found its way into the human
population in 2019. It causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the
ongoing pandemic has a devastating effect on wide parts of the human
population (1). The virus is highly contagious causing the disease to spread very
rapidly, yet symptoms of infected individuals vary widely. A fraction of COVID-19
patients develops a fatal course of the disease, while mild COVID-19 cases are
frequently observed (2). Different co-morbidity factors were recently identified,
whereas the prediction of the course of the disease is not yet possible (3). Protective
antibodies formed after infection are associated with viral clearance, but the
occurrence of high antibody titres has also been linked to more serious forms of the
disease (4). A role of pre-existing and cross-reacting antibodies, from endemic
coronaviruses, that recognize proteins from SARS-CoV-2 is discussed and a
phenomenon termed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is linked to
existing antibodies, might be one of the reasons for life-threatening symptoms
occurring during later stages of COVID-19 (5,6).
An assay capable of detecting antibodies against endemic coronaviridae, such as
OC43, 229E, and NL63, will help to understand a possible role of existing antibodies
against these human coronaviruses during COVID-19. Available systems are using
recombinant antigens to detect viral protein-directed antibodies in serum or plasma
samples. This approach is not only economical but also makes the generation of
large reagent batches feasible, allowing for the generation of vast numbers of assays
required for systematic patient screening (7,8). Here, we employ a novel way of
building a serologic assay system to detect and characterise anti-SARS-CoV-2

antibodies. The approach utilised is based on the classical Western blot procedure,
which has been modified to be run as a throughput assay system. The use of the
complete pathogen proteome for antibody detection has been employed since the
late 1970s (9) and subsequently proven to be useful for the identification of proteins
recognized during the humoral immune response. In lysates, prepared from
infectious virus particles, not only all possible viral proteins are present and can be
probed in one assay, but the use of authentic antigens should enable the detection of
antibodies recognising relevant protein modifications present in the naturally
occurring pathogen.
The DigiWest procedure, which is employed here, is a variant of the classical
Western blot. It addresses the most obvious disadvantages of Western blotting,
namely its low throughput, high antigen consumption and poor reproducibility. In the
DigiWest, the assay signal is generated on microspheres rather than on a
membrane, thus allowing the use of fast and standardised assay protocols on the
Luminex platform. Due to the inbuilt possibility of multiplexing, multiple antigens from
different viruses can be probed at the same time, enabling the set-up of semiquantitative seroreactivity screens.

Materials and Methods
Patients and blood samples
A total of 263 pre-existing and de-identified serum samples was used for assay
development. Ethical approval was granted from the Ethics Committee of University
Hospital Tübingen; samples from 193 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
positive individuals (179/2020/BO2) and of 18 self-reported negative samples were
collected (179/2020/BO2). A self-reported healthy serum sample (n=1) and selfreported convalescent serum after SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=2) were obtained at the
NMI under the guidelines of the local ethics committees (495/2018/BO2). Sample
collection for each donor was performed approximately three to eight weeks after the
end of symptoms and / or negative virus smear. In addition, samples from healthy
donors obtained from Central BioHub before 8/2019 were used as negative controls
(n=49).
SARS-CoV-2 virus lysate
To prepare SARS-CoV-2 virus lysate, the supernatant of infected human Caco-2
cells was purified. Briefly, Caco-2 cells were infected 1:10 - 1:500 with clinical isolate
200325_Tü1. 48 hours post infection the supernatant was collected, centrifuged and
frozen. 900 µL of supernatant was added to 200 µL 20 % sucrose and centrifuged for
90 min at 4 °C and 14000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded and a PBS washing
step was done, followed by another centrifugation step. The supernatant was
discarded and the viral pellet was re-suspended in 25 µL of LDS sample buffer (Life
Technologies) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C.

Whole viral protein lysates from 229E, OC43, and NL63 (ZeptoMetrix Corp) and from
SARS-CoV-2 were used for DigiWest as described. Briefly, viral protein lysates were
used for gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using the NuPAGE system.
Membranes were washed with PBST (0.1 % Tween-20, PBS) and membrane-bound
proteins were biotinylated by adding 50 µM NHS-PEG12-Biotin (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in PBST for 1 h. After washing in PBST, membranes were dried overnight.
Subsequently, the Western-Blot lanes were cut into 96 strips of 0.5 mm width and
were transferred to a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One). For protein elution, 10 µL of
elution buffer was added to each well (8 M urea, 1 % Triton-X100 in 100 mM Tris-HCl
pH 9.5) The protein eluates were diluted with 90 µL dilution buffer (5 % BSA in PBST,
0.02% sodium azide). Neutravidin-coated MagPlex beads (Luminex) of a distinct
colour ID were added to the protein eluates and binding was allowed overnight; 500
µM PEG12-biotin in PBST was added to block remaining Neutravidin binding sites.
The bead containing fractions were pooled and thereby the original Western blot
lanes were reconstituted. Beads were washed in PBST and resuspended in store
buffer (1 % BSA, 0.05 % azide, PBS). The generated bead-set represents the
proteomes of the four coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, OC43, 229E, NL63) and
reactivity against all proteins can be tested in one assay.
For serum incubation, 5 µL of the bead mix were equilibrated in 50 µL serum assay
buffer (Blocking Reagent for ELISA (Roche) supplemented with 0.2 % milk powder,
0.05 % Tween-20 and 0.02 % sodium azide, 25 % Low Cross buffer (Candor
Bioscience), 25 % IgM-reducing agent buffer (ImmunoChemistry). Serum assay
buffer was discarded and 30 µL of diluted patient serum (1:200 in serum assay
buffer) was added and incubated for 2 hours at RT on a shaker. After washing in
PBST, 30 µL of Phycoerythrin labelled anti-human IgG secondary antibody (diluted

1:200 in serum assay buffer; Dianova) was added and incubated for 45 min at 23 °C.
The beads were washed twice with PBST and readout was performed on a Luminex
FlexMAP 3D.
The DigiWest analysis tool was used to assess serum reactivity against the viral
proteins (10). Virus protein-specific peaks were identified and average fluorescence
intensity (AFI) values were calculated by integration of peak areas.
To detect the nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 a commercial antibody was used (Sino
Biologicals; 40143-R019). Incubation was performed as described previously (11).
Statistical analysis
Sensitivity and specificity for each assay were calculated using the results of the
PCR-testing as the gold standard. Concordance was calculated using Cohen’s
Kappa with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) (12). Correlation was calculated using
Spearman´s r with 95 % CI. For determining the dynamic range, a sigmoidal,
4-parameter logistic regression was used to fit the data and interpolate the dilution
factor at the cut-off signal. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 8 or R studio (version 1.3.959).

Results
DigiWest for detecting serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
The DigiWest procedure is a variation of the Western blot that brings this classical
approach into significantly higher throughput (9). Here, we used the method for size
dependent separation of virus proteins reflecting the whole proteome and their
subsequent immobilization on microspheres in order to adapt it to serum analysis. As
a first step for detecting, serum antibodies recognizing viral proteins, lysates from
infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles were prepared in SDS-PAGE loading buffer.
DigiWest was performed as described using 0.5 µg of virus protein and Luminex
microspheres sufficient to run 100 assays were generated. Detection of total protein
on the loaded DigiWest beads (Fig. 1A) showed characteristic protein bands for the
lysate.
In the next step, human sera were diluted 1:200 in an optimized and modified serum
assay buffer (see Materials and Methods) and incubated with the DigiWest
microspheres. For SARS-CoV-2 negative samples, no or very low signals were
obtained (Fig. 1D). High signals were detected from COVID-19 convalescent sera.
Most sera showed their main peak of reactivity at 47 kDa, i.e. the size corresponding
to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Fig. 1C). Using an antibody generated
against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, a prominent peak at 47.2 kDa (Fig. 1B) was
detected, which is consistent with the expected size of the protein. For a subset of
serum samples, additional peaks corresponding to the spike protein are detected
(Fig. 1E). Assay background was found to be variable, but since the determined
signal intensities only consist of the peak area, reliable values were calculated using
the DigiWest evaluation tool (10). Since reactivity against the nucleocapsid protein

was consistently found in COVID-19 convalescent sera, these values were used for
describing SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity.
Multiplexed DigiWest for detecting serum antibodies recognizing different
human coronaviridae
To expand the assay and to cover human endemic coronaviruses, virus lysates from
the two alpha coronaviruses 229E and NL63 and from the beta coronavirus OC43
were processed as described above, and equivalent DigiWest assays were
established and combined into one assay system. When using sera from SARS-CoV2 negative individuals, seroreactivity against viral proteins was found for a large
fraction of tested samples. As for the SARS-CoV-2 DigiWest assay, the main
serological activity for the different viruses was detected at a molecular weight that
corresponds to nucleocapsid proteins. To prove that the detected proteins are indeed
the nucleocapsids of the different coronaviruses, we produced recombinant versions
of the nucleocapsid proteins of all tested viruses. We used the purified proteins in a
different DigiWest experiment and compared the obtained signals with the signals
obtained from the whole virus lysate DigiWest (Fig. 2A). In the whole virus lysate, the
observed molecular weight of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was 47.2 kDa with
a calculated molecular weight of 45.6 kDa, for OC43 nucleocapsid protein it was
53.1 kDa (calculated 49.3 kDa), for 229E nucleocapsid protein it was 45.4 kDa
(calculated 43.5 kDa) and for NL63 it was 42.1 kDa (calculated 42.3 kDa) and
thereby in good agreement with the expected values. The DigiWest using
recombinant proteins (Fig. 2B) confirmed the molecular weights. A small set of 12
sera was used to detect seroreactivity on virus lysates and on the recombinant
nucleocapsid proteins. Correlating signal was detected and this confirmed that the
detected reactivity is directed against the nucleocapsid proteins.

Evaluation of the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 serological assay
To characterize the performance of the DigiWest, we used the final multiplexed
assay now comprising virus lysates of SARS-CoV-2, 229E, OC43 and NL63 to
screen a set of characterized samples (13). Among the analyzed sera, there were
195 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive specimens, 49 pre-pandemic samples and 19 selfreported negative samples. The complete data set, including a graphical
representation of the assay signals in a Western-blot-like format, is available online in
Supplemental Data 1. To define the assay cut-off for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity,
68 non-infected control samples were employed. The highest signal value detected in
this group was 1598 AFI. In a second step, the lowest value of all SARS-CoV-2
PCR-positive specimens still above this intensity (1968 AFI) was defined as a
seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean of these two measurements was calculated
and defined to be the cutoff for seroconversion (1783 AFI). Using this value, an
assay specificity of 100 % was found. Furthermore, 26 / 195 (13.3 %) samples from
SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive specimens showed no seroconversion, yielding a
sensitivity of 87.2 %. These fundamental characteristics of the newly established
assay system are comparable to published values for different commercially
available SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays (14,15).
To demonstrate the dynamic range of the serologic DigiWest assay, a SARS-CoV-2
positive serum was serially diluted with a negative serum (Fig. 3). Good signal
linearity was seen in the dilution curve and seropositivity was detected down to a
serum dilution of 1:5000.
For closer evaluation of the assay performance, we reanalyzed the complete sample
set using the (i) Elecsys® anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Diagnostics), (ii) ADVIA
Centaur® SARS-CoV-2 (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) (16), (iii) EUROIMMUN

systems. Further information on the assay procedures are provided in the
Supplemental Data 2.
Concordance (Cohen’s kappa) and Correlation (Spearman’s r) analysis were
performed and the different assay characteristics were compared and visualized
(Fig.4A-D). Concordance of DigiWest vs Roche was found to be 0.9429 (95 % CI;
0.90-0.98 Fig.4A) and for DigiWest vs Siemens, Cohen’s kappa was 0.8860 (95 %
CI; 0.83-0.94 Fig.4B). Concordance of DigiWest vs Euroimmun IgG was calculated
in two ways: if the borderline results were considered positive, Cohen’s kappa was
found to be 0.9102 (95 % CI; 0.86-0.96), if considered negative, the concordance was
0.8799 (95 % CI; 0.82-0.94 Fig.4C). When comparing the DigiWest based IgG
detection with the Euroimmun based IgA test and borderline results were considered
positive, a value of 0.7498 (95 % CI; 0.67-0.83) was found. If the borderline results
were considered negative, Cohen’s kappa was found to be 0.7518 (95 % CI; 0.670.83).
Correlation analysis utilizing Spearman´s r revealed a positive correlation of all
investigated assays (Fig. 4D). The highest correlation for DigiWest was found with
the Roche system (Spearman´s r= 0.91; 95 % CI; 0.89-0.93). Spearman´s r for
DigiWest and Siemens was found to be 0.87 (95 % CI; 0.83-0.90). Spearman´s r for
DigiWest and Euroimmun IgG and IgA was calculated at 0.87 (95 % CI; 0.84-0.90)
and 0.78 (95 % CI; 0.72-0.82). The highest overall correlation was found between
Siemens and Euroimmun IgG (Spearman´s r = 0.94; 95 % CI; 0.92-0.96), the lowest
overall correlation was found between Euroimmun IgA and Roche (Spearman´s r =

were compared based on the SARS-CoV-2 PCR status. The determined values for
all employed systems are listed in Table 1.
Multiplexed detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, OC43, 229E and NL63
By integrating DigiWest assays for 229E, OC43 and NL63 into the detection system
for SARS-CoV-2, concomitant detection of the presence of antibodies binding to
antigens derived from the different Coronaviridae becomes possible. In the analyzed
sample set, reactive antibodies against all endemic coronaviruses were detected with
high frequency (Supplemental Data 1). To estimate the reactivity against the other
human endemic coronaviruses, a provisional cutoff for OC43, 229E and NL63 was
defined at same value as determined for SARS-CoV-2 (1783 AFI). For Sars-CoV-2
negative sera, 82.4 % showed reactivity against OC43 nucleocapsid, 95.6 % against
229E and 100 % against NL63. For SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, the numbers
were 79.5 % against OC43, 99 % against 229E and 98.5 % against NL63. The overall
reactivity was 80.2 % against OC43, 98.1 % against 229E and 98.9 % against NL63.
Despite the high frequency of antibodies directed against the endemic coronaviruses
OC43, 229E, and NL63 in SARS-CoV-2 negative sera, no recognition of
SARS-CoV-2 proteins was observed in these samples. This directly translates into
the high specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 assay system and reveals that only minor or
no cross-reactivity of existing antibodies with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein
exists. The correlation analysis between all coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2)
showed values ranging from 0.03 to 0.75 (Fig. 5). The highest correlation was
observed for antibodies recognizing the nucleocapsid protein of 229E and NL63 with
a Spearman´s r of 0.75 indicating a possible cross-reactivity.

Discussion
The use of authentic proteins from clinically relevant pathogens as antigens for
antibody detection is a classical method for identifying an individual immune
response (17). While the approach has distinct drawbacks, e. g. the need for isolation
of large amounts of pathogen and poor assay reproducibility when using different
protein batches, it also provides substantial advantages. Modifications only found in
the authentic proteins are present in antigen preparations and therefore the
identification of reactive antibodies against these possible pathogen-derived antigens
should be feasible. In addition, the generation of protein extract from pathogens of
different strains is often technically uncomplicated and fast. This may turn out to be
especially useful when a comparative analysis of antigen preparations from closely
related pathogenic agents is of interest. Such an analysis may facilitate the
identification of relevant cross-reacting antibodies directly on a wide variety of
antigenic structures. These advantages may help to set up systems that take an
unbiased approach to characterising the humoral immune response and may allow
the identification of cross-reacting antibodies.
Here we describe the set-up of such an assay system using protein extracts
prepared directly from infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. The employed
DigiWest procedure is an immunoblot system that closely resembles the classical
Western blot procedure. After SDS-PAGE based protein size separation, proteins are
immobilized on polystyrene microspheres and assay read-out is performed on the
Luminex assay platform. 10 micrograms of protein are sufficient to generate batches
of assay material for thousands of serum analyses; this directly translates into good
assay reproducibility. In addition, the use of the Luminex platform for read-out allows
for a high assay throughput without the need for producing recombinant proteins. As

in Western blotting, the assay gives direct information on the size of the recognized
proteins, and often antigenic proteins can be directly identified. When using
COVID-19 convalescent sera, a specific antibody response to a protein of 47 kDa
corresponding to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 was recurrently seen.
Reactivity against other viral proteins was present in individual serum samples, yet
the nucleocapsid protein was identified as the major antigen in this assay. The
observed low seroreactivity against the spike protein is due to the fact that reduced
and denatured proteins were employed for the DigiWest and that these protein forms
are not recognized by most of the anti-spike antibodies (data not shown).
For the detailed evaluation of the performance of the newly developed assay for
detecting anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies a set of more than 250 well-characterized
sera was employed, which were mainly taken from a clinical study on T-cell response
after SARS-CoV-2 infection (13). By using 4 different serological assays that are in
use in clinical routine labs we showed high concordance (Cohen’s Kappa 0.88-0.94)
between all systems. The detected specificity as compared to the PCR results was
found to be ranging from 85.5 % to 100 %, with the DigiWest, the Roche and the
Siemens systems approaching 100 %. Sensitivity was found between 76.4 % and
87.2 %, with the DigiWest reaching the highest score here. This demonstrates high
standards for all tested assays. Interestingly, the highest concordance (0.94) was
found between the Siemens assay system and the Euroimmun IgG assay, with both
assays mainly detecting the spike protein. Nearly the same Kappa value was
calculated for the Roche and the DigiWest system, both of which use the
nucleocapsid protein as the detected antigen. The Euroimmun IgA showed slightly
different assay characteristics, which is most likely due to the fact that it is the only

assay that exclusively detects IgA immunoglobulins. Yet, no principle differences in
assay characteristics were observed and all assays showed high quality.
Antibodies against endemic coronaviruses are frequently found in human individuals
(18). These viruses cause mild diseases and are associated with approximately 20 %
of the common colds (19,20). However, when comparing the sequences of the virus
genome, the degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and these viruses is
astonishingly high (21). This similarity has led to speculations that antibodies against
these endemic viruses may also possess protective properties against SARV-CoV-2
(22). The presence of these antibodies might explain the vastly diverse courses of
disease. Therefore, the DigiWest assay system was expanded by using lysates from
alpha coronaviruses 229E and NL63 as well as the beta coronaviruses OC43, thus
enabling the detection of serum antibodies recognizing antigens from these four
coronaviruses from one specimen in one assay. The implementation of these assays
directly followed the method used for SARS-CoV-2 and seroreactivity against the
nucleocapsid protein was frequently found for these coronaviruses.
As expected a very high rate of infection for all of the coronaviruses was found, yet
no indication of cross-reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins was seen in prepandemic and other SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. This is in contrast to the
described T-cell response that can be triggered by peptides derived from the
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (13,23).
Since the described assay was optimized for specificity, the employed assay
conditions were highly stringent to avoid the occurrence of false positive signals.
Modifications of the assay that use less stringent conditions assays could be used to
detect cross-reactivity of antibodies formed against proteins from endemic

coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. This could give valuable information on
the nature of these frequently found anti-corona antibodies; this work is ongoing.
As a serologic assay system the use of the DigiWest approach is not only novel, but
it allows the set-up of a highly specific assay within a very short time frame and it is
capable of detecting a wide variety of serum antibodies since all pathogen-derived
proteins can be probed in one reaction.

Figure legends
Figure 1: Protein detection on SARS-CoV-2 virus lysate loaded DigiWest beads.
Virus proteins were size separated by the Digiwest procedure and transferred to
microspheres. In (A) a total protein stain of the separated proteins is shown; data are
represented as Western-Blot mimic (10) thereby resembling a SDS-Page lane. The
marked protein band corresponds to the viral nucleocapsid protein. An anti-SARSCoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody detects this protein at the expected molecular weight
(47.2 kDa) (B). Serum from a SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient reacts with the
same protein (47.2 kDa) giving high fluorescent intensity (C), whereas in a negative
serum no peaks are detected (D). In a fraction of positive sera, additional peaks at
100 kDa and 211 kDa are detected (E, detailed view of C).
Figure 2: Multiplexed detection nucleocapsid protein from SARS-CoV-2, OC43,
229E, and NL63. Reactivity of a patient serum was tested on whole virus lysates of
the different coronavirus types (A) and on recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of the
different viruses (B) using multiplexed DigiWest assays. The used SARS-CoV-2
positive serum shows antibody reactivity on whole virus lysates for (i) SARS-CoV-2,
(ii) OC43, (iii) 229E, and (iv) NL63 (A). In (B) the same serum is incubated with a
DigiWest bead-set loaded with recombinant nucleocapsid from (i) SARS-CoV-2, (ii)
OC43, (iii) 229E, and (iv) NL63. As for the whole virus lysates antibody reactivity is
observed; for SARS-CoV-2 a peak at 47.2 is kDa detected, for the endemic
Coronaviridae OC43, 229E, and NL63 peaks at the molecular weights at the
respective sizes of 53.1, 45.4 and 42.1 kDa are found.
Figure 3: Dynamic range of the DigiWest serological assay. The serum of a
SARS-CoV-2 positive patient was diluted in serum of a SARS-CoV-2 negative donor
(serial dilution,13 steps ranging from 1:25 to 1:1131). The mixture was further diluted
1:200 in serum assay buffer and the immunoassay was performed. Shown are the
final dilutions of positive serum (X-axis) and the resulting average fluorescence
intensity (AFI). Logistic regression was performed using a sigmoidal fit and 4parameter logistics. (Bottom 110.0; Top 34406; IC50 2.962; HillSlope -1.411; logIC50

Roche (A), Siemens (B) and Euroimmun IgG (C) were calculated and are shown
below the plotted data; cutoff values are depicted as a black line in the scatter plot.
For the Euroimmun IgG two different kappa values were calculated; when borderline
results (as defined by the manufacturer) were considered positive, kappa was
0.9102. If the borderline results were considered negative, the concordance for
Euroimmun IgG was 0.8799. In (D) the correlation coefficients (Spearman´s r)
between all used assays are shown in a heatmap. The highest value (Spearman´s r
= 0.91) for DigiWest was found for the Roche system, the lowest value (Spearman’s r
= 0.78) for DigiWest vs Euroimmun IgA shown of Spearman´s r values.
Figure 5: Spearman´s rank correlation of SARS-CoV2 and endemic coronavirus
types in the serological DigiWest assay. Data generated for SARS-CoV-2, OC43,
229E and NL63 were used for correlation analysis and Spearman´s rank coefficients
were calculated for assay pairing. Results are displayed as heatmap of Spearman´s r
values. A high correlation (Spearman´s r 0.75) was found between NL63 and 229E
indicating cross-reactivity.
