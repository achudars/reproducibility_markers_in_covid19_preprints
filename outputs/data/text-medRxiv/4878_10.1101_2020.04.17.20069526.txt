Abstract
Aim
In addition to respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 can present with gastrointestinal complaints
suggesting possible faeco-oral transmission. The primary aim of this review was to establish
the incidence and timing of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in patients with
COVID-19.
Methods
A systematic literature review identified studies describing COVID-19 patients tested for
faecal virus. Search terms for Medline included ‘clinical’, ‘faeces’, ‘gastrointestinal
secretions’, ‘stool’, ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’ and ‘2019-nCoV’. Additional searches
were done in AJG, Gastroenterology, Gut, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, The
WHO Database, CEBM, NEJM, social media and the NICE, bioRxiv and medRxiv preprints.
Data were extracted concerning the type of test, number and timing of positive samples,
incidence of positive faecal tests after negative nasopharyngeal swabs and evidence of viable
faecal virus or faeco-oral transmission of the virus.
Results
There were 26 relevant articles identified. Combining study results demonstrated that 53·9%
of those tested for faecal RNA were positive. Duration of faecal viral shedding ranged from 1
to 33 days after a negative nasopharyngeal swab with one result remaining positive 47 days
after onset of symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is
transmitted via faecally shed virus.
Conclusion
There is a high rate of positive PCR tests with persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal samples
of patients with COVID-19. Further research is needed to confirm if this virus is viable and
the degree of transmission through the faeco-oral route. This may have important
implications on isolation, recommended precautions and protective equipment for
interventional procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract.
Key words
COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal, faeces, viral shedding
What does this paper add to the existing literature?
We synthesise all available evidence from multiple sources and clarify the uncertainty around
faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus, its persistence and duration from onset of symptoms,
and after negative nasopharyngeal swabs. Evidence for faeco-oral transmission is plausible
and demonstrated in one study though its relative contribution to transmission remains
unclear.
Persistent viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces – a rapid review
Introduction
The rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for the
public as well as healthcare professionals around the world. Knowledge regarding virus
incubation, transmission and shedding is crucial for the reduction of new cases and protection
of health care professionals. Guidance regarding isolation and protective equipment has
changed as evidence has increased and developed.

The high incidence of cough and fever in COVID-19 are well established [1].
Gastrointestinal symptoms are also well documented suggesting a potential faeco-oral
transmission route [2]. Discharge guidelines for hospitals or declaring a COVID-19 patient
recovered in the UK are largely based on time from either symptom onset or positive test
depending on severity of illness and discharge destination [3].The European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on the other hand, has advocated the need for
continued self-isolation and hand hygiene measures even 14 days post-discharge based on
prolonged viral shedding in faeces and respiratory samples [4]. This evidence may influence
the recommended duration of self-isolation, home sanitation practices during isolation and
after discharge and the use of protective equipment for procedures involving the
gastrointestinal tract. Evidence based recommendations for specialities such as
gastroenterology, gastrointestinal endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery are required where
there may be an exposure risk to virus shed in faeces. Despite viral RNA being detected in
the air or other surface samples like toilets, it is still unclear whether it is viable to transmit
infection through this route [5].
The primary aim of this review is to assess the incidence and timing of positive faecal
samples for SARS-CoV-2 in relation to the clinical course of patients with COVID-19.
Our secondary aims are to establish the incidence of patients with positive faecal samples
after negative respiratory swabs and any evidence to suggest faecal virus transmitted
infection.

Methods
Reports of cases or studies of COVID-19 patients with evidence of the virus in faecal
samples were systematically identified and full text articles reviewed for data extraction.
Literature search
A comprehensive search was undertaken as per the search strategy outlined below for
literature which included SARS-CoV-2 virus testing of faeces. Medline was searched to find
articles published until 3 April 2020. The defined search terms were created after
collaboration between the authors experienced in gastroenterology, colorectal surgery and
systematic review. Search terms reflected the aim to identify studies with evidence of faecal
COVID-19 and included ‘clinical’, ‘faeces’, ‘gastrointestinal secretions’, ‘stool’, ‘COVID19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’ and ‘2019-nCoV’. Additional manual searches to identify the most
recent evidence were performed in the American Journal of Gastroenterology (AJG),
Gastroenterology, GUT, the Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, the WHO database,
the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM), the New England Journal of Medicine
(NEJM), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). COVID-19
preprints published until 10 April 2020 on medRxiv and bioRxiv and an independent search
on social media (Twitter) by the authors (SS, SD) supplemented more articles. The search
strategy used for social media and brief description of the WHO and other databases has been
provided in the supplementary methods section.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Articles describing COVID-19 patients who had faecal or stool specimens tested for the virus
were included. Considering the knowledge gaps existing for COVID-19 all articles were
considered regardless of the number, age or gender of patients or the country of publication.
Animal based studies or articles without an available full text were excluded. Foreign

language articles were considered but excluded unless the necessary language expertise was
available within the research group.
Study identification
Articles were sorted alphabetically by author name and divided between two reviewers (SG
and JP). Abstracts were reviewed and classified by the same two authors through the Rayyan
Web Application [6] to identify those for full text review. The same process was used for full
text articles and this data was managed through EndNote. Articles were then discussed
between the same reviewers to identify the final selection of full text articles. Any conflicts
were to be solved by the supervising author if necessary. Reference lists and review articles
were cross referenced to identify any further original studies. All articles were categorised
and described in a PRISMA flow chart.
Data extraction
The final data extraction was also carried by the two reviewers (JP and SG) and managed
through Microsoft Excel files. The data parameters extracted from the studies are shown in
Table 1. The final data was verified by the two reviewers (JP and SG) with conflict resolution
as described previously if necessary.

1 to 206 with ages ranging from 3 months to 87 years. Sample collection consisted of either
faecal samples, anal or rectal swabs. Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) was the test performed on all samples to detect viral RNA.
The indication for faecal testing was not specified in most studies. In some the test was done
in asymptomatic patients for screening after contact with an infected person or travel history
to an infected area. The predominant symptoms of presentation in the studies were persistent
cough, fever and breathlessness with fewer patients reporting diarrhoea or vomiting. All
studies had information regarding our primary aim of reporting faecal samples for the virus in
those with COVID-19. Of these, 16 [7,10,11,14-19,23,24,26-30] provided information on the
duration of these tests after symptom onset and evidence of positive faecal samples after
symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital or negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. The
data extraction has been summarised in Table 3 and 4 which are divided based on the number
of patients tested for faecal RT-PCR in the study (≤ 10 and >10 respectively) and the detailed
combined table is attached as a supplementary results table.

NP: Nasopharyngeal; NA: Not applicable; RT-PCR: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain reaction
Table 4: Overview of data extracted from studies included in the review with > 10 patients tested for
faecal virus [11,12,17,20,25-27,30-32]

A total of 824 patients were included across the studies and 540 were tested for faecal viral
RNA [7-32]. Positive faecal RT-PCR tests occurred in 291 (53·9%). The timing of the first
positive sample was available in 21 studies and varied from day 0 of symptom onset to day
17. Late positive tests do not necessarily equate to absence of the virus earlier in the illness
but may likely reflect the heterogeneity in testing patterns amongst the studies. First stool
samples were often reported late after hospital admission [11] or even after discharge [28]
while some were analysed from day 1 of hospitalisation or symptom onset [19,20,27,29,32].
There is a similar discrepancy in follow up testing. Some tested until samples were found to
be negative [17] while others did not [18,29].
Out of 199 patients who tested positive for faecal viral RNA and were followed up with stool
testing, 125 (62·8%) showed persistent shedding of virus in the stool samples after a negative
nasopharyngeal swab while in the individual studies it ranged from 23·3% to 100%. The
duration for faecal shedding of viral RNA after clearance of respiratory samples ranged from
1 to 33 days and in 1 patient up to 47 days from symptom onset [26].
None of the studies were designed to detect live virus in the faeces except for the study by
Wang et al [25]. Out of 153 stool specimens tested in this study, 44 were PCR positive and
out of 4 specimens cultured, live virus was detected in 2 [25].
Discussion
This rapid review demonstrates a high incidence and persistence of positive faecal RT-PCR
tests for SARS-CoV-2 after negative nasopharyngeal swabs in patients with COVID-19. This
may have important implications regarding measures to prevent the spread of disease,
precautions recommended for the public and protective equipment for health professionals
performing interventions involving the gastrointestinal tract.
A Chinese review performed by Tian et al. summarised evidence on the importance of
identifying gastrointestinal symptoms in addition to the respiratory symptoms of patients with
COVID-19 [33]. Despite persistent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus in faeces there seems to
be no correlation with the presence or severity of gastrointestinal symptoms based on the
limited data available. Our review adds to this evidence from China and describes the
plausibility of faeco-oral transmission.
Despite this review demonstrating a high incidence of positive tests for virus in the faeces,
the absence of evidence to confirm infectivity from this must be emphasised. In order to
adequately confirm this, good quality evidence is required to demonstrate infectious virus in
faeces and its risk of transmitting disease between individuals. This data may then enable the
development of reliable guidelines and recommendations. However, given the rapid
development of the pandemic, this will take time and reviews such as this may help guide
focussed and valuable research questions for the future. The findings of our review provide a
synopsis of the best available evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 in the faeces at the current
time.

Evidence regarding other coronaviruses may be helpful in this context. Similar patterns of
virus isolation from stool and faeco-oral transmission were observed for other coronaviruses
including SARS-CoV-1 [34]. Bio-aerosol generation of viral particles as a result of toilet
flushing, the impact of disinfection on this [35,36] and the persistence of coronaviruses on
surfaces has been studied before [37]. Other indirect evidence of microbial exposure and
contamination of the operator’s face during endoscopy [38] and laboratory evidence of SARS
COV2 infection of the gastrointestinal tract and mechanisms [39,40] add to the evidence for
plausibility of transmission.
The risk to health care professionals from patient exposure is well known, specifically in high
aerosol generating procedures. Professional societies and investigator groups from countries
with experience of managing COVID-19 in the context of gastrointestinal interventions
[41,42] highlight the risk to individuals in endoscopy departments and the need for necessary
precautions including negative pressure rooms and personal protective equipment for both
upper and lower GI procedures. This review supports the importance of these measures given
a high prevalence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in faeces. Isolation of live virus is
confirmed only by one study [25] and the proportion of cases that might be transmitted by
this route is unclear due to the heterogeneity in case selection and lack of standardisation of
study designs and protocols. Environments such as Care Homes may be particularly
vulnerable to transmission of infection by this route and recommendations must take into
account this evidence to ensure the protection of health and social care providers and the
general public in the meantime. Application of this data to the population may be helpful in
guiding the recommendations for isolation periods to reduce transmission rates.
Limitations
Despite finding a high incidence of positive faecal samples for SARS-CoV-2 in the included
studies, our review cannot confirm the true population prevalence of positive faecal samples
or the rate of false negatives. This is due to the significant variability in study design which is
an inherent problem with COVID-19 research at present. This heterogeneity was not formally
assessed due to it being a rapid review but can be clearly identified on inspection of the study
designs and outcomes. The variability in patient numbers and characteristics, sample timing,
sample nature (faecal samples vs. anal or faecal swabs) and follow up testing should be
considered when interpreting the reliability of the results. If other studies confirm viable virus
in stool, then methods of culture also need to be described and standardised for comparison
and replication in other populations. The majority of the included studies are small,
heterogenous, retrospective and often did not assess viral shedding in the faeces as their
primary aim. At present however this is the only evidence available. There were two foreign
language articles excluded due to lack of translation resources. The pre-prints are not peer
reviewed and therefore should be trusted with caution.
Conclusion
The duration of viral shedding in the faeces is mostly reported from 1 to 33 days after a
negative nasopharyngeal swab but can continue for up to 47 days after onset of symptoms in
patients with COVID-19. These positive samples can occur after negative nasopharyngeal
swabs or resolution of patient symptoms. Isolation of live virus in stool specimens of 2 cases
in a single study supports the possibility of faeco-oral transmission. Further research is
needed to prove if this viral shedding in stool results in a significant proportion of case
transmission in the community as well as within care institutions and secondary care. Until

further evidence is generated appropriate precautions should be recommended for the
protection of healthcare workers and patients.
Implications for the Public:
1. In addition to strict adherence to hand washing recommendations, home toilet sanitary
and disinfection precautions should be taken in the case of isolation or contact with a
symptomatic COVID 19 case with or without gastrointestinal symptoms. This statement
is based on limited evidence of possible viable faecal virus excretion.
2. These precautions may need to continue for longer than the period of symptoms and the
current recommendations for isolation after symptoms cease. This statement is based on
limited evidence of the duration after the onset of symptoms that an RT-PCR stool test
might still be positive

Implications for Healthcare professionals:
1. Professional bodies recommendations on protective equipment, endoscopic and surgical
procedures for COVID-19 patients should be followed [43-46].
2. The possibility of faeco-oral transmission should be borne in mind with implications for
endoscopy and theatre disinfection of surfaces in between procedures.
3. Ward areas for COVID-19 patients and Care homes or similar institutions may need to
consider the implications for infection control and disinfection in light of the possibility
of faeco-oral transmission
4. Screening processes for patients due to undergo investigational or interventional
procedures may need to consider including gastrointestinal symptoms and stool testing
in future pre-procedure questionnaires.
5. Healthcare teams managing patients with gastrointestinal symptoms may need to
consider the possibility of COVID-19 coexisting with or worsening symptoms of
underlying conditions such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease [47].
Recommendations for further research:

1. Future studies on viral shedding and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 should consider
standardisation of sampling methods in terms of the timing and the type of sample
collection, with appropriate precautions for laboratory staff handling these samples until
the situation is clearer.
2. Study designs may wish to consider repeat and parallel sampling with nasopharyngeal
swabs at defined time points. This may be correlated with symptoms and serology to
clarify the effect of neutralising antibodies and viable virus excretion in the stool.
3. Study designs may benefit from testing stool samples from comparable groups. This
could include symptomatic, asymptomatic or recovered individuals in and out of family
clusters and with or without gastrointestinal symptoms. This may improve our
understanding of clinical and public health implications and potential targets for
intervention in these settings.

Supplementary methods section
The Mesh terms used for Medline have already been mentioned in the methods section. The
search start date was not specified because the terms ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’ and
‘2019-nCoV’ used for Medline being novel, themselves limit the start date. The Lancet
Gastroenterology and Hepatology was searched for using the terms ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARSCoV-2’ and ‘2019-nCoV’ while in all other databases (WHO, GUT, NICE etc.), and
medRxiv and bioRxiv preprints, the COVID-19 articles are mentioned in a separate section.
These were manually screened by their titles to find the relevant articles for faecal viral
shedding or gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
Search for Twitter by SS done on 08.04.2020 was as follows:
1. Terms were entered into Twitter search bar
• Terms entered in each separate search were: “shedding faeces cov”, “shedding cov”,
“shedding faeces corona” “shedding corona”, “shedding stool cov”, “shedding stool
corona”
2. “top” tweets options selected, and all tweets returned in search were read to look for
relevant content
• Tweets were read and those that included a link to an article relating to the search
term were selected and links to article clicked
• “latest” tweets option selected, and all tweets returned in search were read to look
for relevant content
• Tweets were read and those that included a link to an article relating to the search
term were selected and links to article clicked
Identified articles were then sent to the core term (SG, JP) and screened for relevance.
Links for accessing the various databases are provided in the following table:
