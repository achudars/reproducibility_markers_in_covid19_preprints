Abstract

29

Case isolation and contact tracing can contribute to the control of COVID-19 outbreaks1,2.

30

However, it remains unclear how real-world networks could influence the effectiveness and

31

efficiency of such approaches. To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-

32

CoV-2 in a real-world social network generated from high resolution GPS data 3,4. We found that

33

tracing contacts-of-contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only

34

contacts, but resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in

35

time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting

36

that contact tracing and quarantine may be most effective when it acts as a ‘local lockdown’ when

37

contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact

38

tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our

39

approach highlights the importance of network structure and social dynamics in evaluating the

40

potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 control.

Main

42

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are central to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission 5–8.

43

Such responses generally include: case isolation, tracing and quarantining of contacts, use of PPE

44

and hygiene measures, and policies designed to encourage physical distancing (including closures

45

of schools and workplaces, banning of large public events and restrictions on travel). Due to the

46

varying economic and social costs of these interventions, there is a clear need for sustainable

47

strategies that limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission while reducing disruption as far as possible.

48
49

Isolation of symptomatic cases, and quarantine of their contacts (e.g. household members), is a

50

common public health strategy for reducing disease spread 1,2,8. This approach has been used as

51

part of SARS-CoV-2 control strategies9. However, the relatively high reproduction number of the

52

SARS-CoV2 virus in early outbreak stages10,11, alongside likely high contribution to transmission

53

from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals12, means that manual tracing of contacts alone

54

may not be a sufficient containment strategy under a range of outbreak scenarios 13. As countries

55

relax lockdowns and other more stringent physical distancing measures, combining the isolation of

56

symptomatic individuals and quarantine of contacts identified through fine-scale tracing is likely to

57

play a major role in many national strategies for targeted SARS-CoV-2 control14.

58
59

It is possible to assess the potential effectiveness of contact tracing by simultaneously modelling

60

disease spread and contact tracing strategies through social systems of individuals 15. These

61

systems are usually simulated through parameterisation with simple social behaviours (e.g. the

62

distribution of the number of physical contacts per individual). Further still, social systems may be

63

simulated as networks that can be parameterised according to assumptions regarding different

64

contexts (for example, with different simulated networks for households, schools and workplaces),

65

or using estimated contact rates of different age groups 16. However, much less is known about

66

how different types of real-world social behaviour and the hidden structure found in real-life

67

networks may affect both patterns of disease transmission and efficacy of contact tracing under

68

different scenarios17,18. Examining contagion dynamics and control strategies using a ‘real-world’

69

network allows for a more realistic simulation of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and contact tracing

70

dynamics.

71
72

Here we develop an epidemic model which simulates COVID-19 outbreaks across a real-world

73

network, and we assess the impact of a range of testing and contact tracing strategies for

74

controlling these outbreaks (Table 1). We then simulate physical distancing strategies and quantify

75

how the interaction between physical distancing, contact tracing and testing affects outbreak

76

dynamics.

77
78

We used a publicly available dataset on human social interactions collected specifically for

79

modelling infectious disease dynamics as part of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)

80

documentary “Contagion! The BBC Four Pandemic”. The high-resolution data collection focused

81

on residents of the town of Haslemere, where the first evidence of UK-acquired infection with

82

SARS-CoV-2 would later be reported in late February 2020 19. Previous analyses of this dataset

83

have shown that it is structurally relevant to modelling disease spread, and hence holds substantial

84

potential for understanding and controlling real-world diseases4. Here, we defined dyadic contacts

85

on a day-by-day basis as at least one daily 5 min period with a distance of 4 m (see Methods),

86

which gave 1616 daily contact events and 1257 unique social links between 468 individuals. The

87

social network defined in this way was strongly correlated (r >0.85 in all cases) with social

88

networks based on other contact distances (from 1-7 m contact ranges; Extended Data Fig. 1).

89

Similarly, social networks created using different time-periods for weighting the dyadic contacts

90

(Extended Data Fig. 2) were also strongly related to the weighting used here (i.e. number of days

91

seen together). As such, this social network quantification gives a representative indication of daily

92

contact propensities within the relevant transmission range between individuals (see Methods) and

93

also captures various aspects of the patterns and structure presented by different quantifications of

94

this social system.

96

Example outbreaks across the Haslemere social network under different control scenarios are

97

displayed in Fig. 1, with a full animated visualisation in Supplementary Video 1, and a Shiny app is

98

available to run individual outbreak simulations (see data sharing). Across all simulations, our

99

epidemic model showed that uncontrolled outbreaks in the Haslemere network stemming from a

100

single infected individual resulted in a median of 75% (IQR = 74%-76%) of the population infected

101

after 70 days (Fig. 2). Isolation when symptomatic resulted in 66% (65%-67%) of the population

102

infected, while primary contact tracing resulted in 48% (46%-50%) infected. Secondary contact

103

tracing resulted in the smallest percentage (16%, 14%-19%) of the population infected after 70

104

days. The number of quarantined individuals was very high under both primary and secondary

105

contact tracing, with a median of 43% (IQR = 32%-52%) of the population quarantined during the

106

outbreak peak with the latter (Fig. 2). Examining temporal dynamics showed that outbreak peaks

107

typically occurred within the first 1-3 weeks, and that interventions reduced the overall size of the

108

outbreaks as well as their growth rate (Fig. 2). The number of people required to isolate or

109

quarantine followed a similar trajectory to the number of cases, although under secondary contact

110

tracing, substantial proportions of the population (27%, 18%-35%) were quarantined even at the

111

end of the simulations (Fig. 2). This is in line with a large-scale recent simulation model of app-

112

based contact tracing in the UK20, which suggested that contact tracing could be highly effective,

113

but also that it required large numbers of people to be quarantined. Further, in our (optimistic)

114

default parameter settings we assumed that 10% of contact tracing attempts were missed. This,

115

combined with the very large number of quarantined cases under secondary contact tracing (Fig.

116

2), suggests that a majority of the population could receive a notification that they should

117

quarantine within the first 2-3 weeks of an outbreak.

118
119

Sensitivity analysis of the efficacy of contact tracing under the epidemic model is presented in

120

Extended Data Figs 3-6. As expected, outbreak size decreased with the percentage of contacts

121

traced in all scenarios, and increased with the reproduction number, the proportion of

122

asymptomatic cases, the proportion of pre-onset transmission, the delay between onset/tracing

123

and isolation/quarantine, and the number of initial cases (Extended Data Figs 3-6). Outbreak

124

dynamics were strongly affected by outside infection rate across all intervention scenarios, as were

125

the number of isolated and quarantined cases (Extended Data Fig. 6). Our model therefore

126

corroborates with models using simulated social systems and showing that, for a disease such as

127

COVID-19 with high levels of transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals,

128

contact tracing is likely to be most effective when the proportion of traced contacts is high, when

129

the delay from notification to quarantine is short 13, and, most importantly, when the number of

130

starting cases and rate of movement into the network are low. Importantly, however, the tradeoff

131

between the number of cases and the number of quarantined cases was found across the entirety

132

of the parameter space (Extended Data Figs 3-6). Further, increasing the network density through

133

increasing the distance threshold for defining contacts led to broadly similar results across

134

intervention scenarios, albeit with larger numbers of quarantined cases required for outbreak

135

control via contact tracing (Extended Data Fig. 7). Therefore, while more real-world networks are

136

needed to demonstrate how well these results apply to other locations and settings, our results are

137

robust to a range of epidemiological and network parameters.

138
139

The number of quarantined cases can be reduced through mass testing and release of individuals

140

who return a negative result. Conversely, if contact rates in the population are high, large-scale

141

test and release strategies could provide greater opportunity for transmission and decrease the

142

effectiveness of contact tracing. We therefore assessed how the testing and releasing of isolated

143

and quarantined subjects might affect the numbers of cases and time spent in isolation and

144

quarantine, using false positive and false negative rates estimated from empirical data 21,22

145

(Supplementary Table 1). We estimated that increasing the testing capacity (and therefore testing

146

and releasing more quarantined cases) led to substantial increases in outbreak size, especially

147

under secondary contact tracing (median = 50%, IQR = 48%-52%; Fig. 3A). This result occurred

148

despite an optimistic false negative rate of 10%, suggesting that the increase in outbreak size with

149

high testing rates is a result of increased transmission within the network, rather than through

150

releasing infected cases per se. Therefore, secondary tracing may effectively act as a ‘local

151

lockdown’ rather than a targeted intervention strategy. High levels of testing did not lead to large

152

reductions in the number of quarantined cases under secondary contact tracing scenarios, and the

153

number of tests required to reduce the numbers of quarantined cases were large, with 68% (63%-

154

71%) of the population requiring tests in a single week during outbreak peaks (Fig. 3A). We cannot

155

be sure to what extent our results will represent larger populations, but the tripartite relationship

156

between the number of cases, the number of quarantined contacts and the number of tests

157

required will apply in the majority of scenarios in which rates of social interaction are high.

158
159

A very high notification and quarantine rate for any contact tracing system may have

160

consequences for adherence. Our model is optimistic in its assumption that individuals isolate

161

independently of previous notifications or isolations, and highly optimistic in its assumption of

162

100% adherence to quarantine among traced contacts. In reality a high notification and quarantine

163

rate may result in individuals being less likely to undertake quarantine in the future, which in turn

164

will impact outbreak dynamics. There is a need for more evidence and models to better understand

165

these behavioural dynamics, in order to develop sustainable intervention strategies23. One

166

suggested solution to reduced adherence to quarantine is through (digital) targeted quarantine

167

requests to the individuals at highest risk of infection, or to those most likely to spread to others24.

168

To what extent these interventions will be needed, and how well they will work, is not yet clear;

169

however, our study provides a methodological template for network-based research into SARS-

170

CoV2 and its potential control strategies.

171
172

Combining contact tracing with other physical distancing measures may allow for outbreak control

173

while reducing the number of people in quarantine, and the number of tests required. We

174

simulated physical distancing by reducing the number of weak links in the Haslemere network. We

175

aimed to consider low to moderate levels of physical distancing, so used a model whereby the only

176

interactions with ‘rare’ contacts are removed. We found that, across all scenarios, physical

177

distancing led to reductions in the number of overall cases (Fig. 3B). Importantly, increasing

178

physical distancing was associated with lower numbers of quarantined cases, which was reduced

179

to as little as 6% (3%-9%) during outbreak peaks under secondary contact tracing (Fig. 3B).

180

Simulating physical distancing using an alternative approach whereby removed ‘rare’ contacts

181

were reassigned to existing contacts (see methods) yielded similar results to our simpler model,

182

although using this approach, physical distancing led to smaller decreases in outbreak size

183

(Extended Data Fig. 8). We do not have information on household structure within the Haslemere

184

dataset, but our physical distancing scenario is analogous to decreasing the level of non-

185

household contacts. Therefore it may be that combining measures that reduce non-household

186

contact rates with highly effective contact tracing may be a useful tool for control of SARS-CoV-2

187

spread. However, further work is required to determine exactly what kinds of physical distancing

188

measures would enable effective outbreak control alongside contact tracing. Furthermore, future

189

investigations could also examine how the spread of the disease itself may shape behavioural

190

change interventions (e.g. where large outbreaks spark more severe physical distancing

191

measures), and how this feedback may shape the contagion dynamics and predicted effectiveness

192

of interventions.

193
194

Network structure can have substantial effects on epidemic model predictions 25,26. To investigate

195

this, we used null network models based on the Haslemere data, which maintained the same

196

number of individuals, connections and weights of connections, but shuffled network architecture in

197

different ways (see Methods). The number of cases estimated using the null networks was broadly

198

similar to the real-world network, although this was substantially underestimated in a ‘lattice’ like

199

network (Fig. 4). Importantly, the rate of quarantine varied substantially among the null networks,

200

especially under secondary contact tracing (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the use of

201

network-based simulations of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics requires caution, as even if such models had

202

precise information on the number of individuals and amount of social interactions occurring within

203

a system, the assumed architecture of the social network structure alone can shape predictions for

204

both the extent of spread and the usefulness of control strategies. Furthermore, through providing

205

insight into how changes to network structure influences contagion dynamics, the null network

206

simulation approach gives some indication of how this contagion and associated control strategies

207

may operate in different social environments. For instance, different social structures may arise

208

when considering particular social settings (e.g. workplaces, commuting), some of which may be

209

closer to the null networks generated here. Considering this structure will lead to improved

210

predictions of outbreak dynamics.

211
212

There are a number of important limitations to our study and the current availability of empirical

213

data in general. Most importantly, this social network is taken from a single, small town and over a

214

short period of time, and we do not know to what extent the social dynamics will be applicable to

215

larger cities and other contexts and over long periods. Therefore, future large-scale efforts in

216

gathering data on dynamic fine-scale social behaviour over long periods of time (ideally over the

217

entire contagion period) in major cities would be of great benefit for assessing the relative uses of

218

SARS-CoV-2 control strategies, and for understanding how and why interventions implemented in

219

some cities have been relatively more successful than others27. Indeed, the epidemic network-

220

based model provided here can be applied generally to more extensive social networks if such

221

data becomes available in the future. Further, the Haslemere data, while rich, does not sample the

222

entire population of Haslemere, and children under the age of 13 were not included in the

223

experiment, which could potentially have an impact on outbreak and social tracking dynamics.

224

Again, such issues are also likely to be prevalent across real-world contact-tracing attempts, as the

225

ability to track children will be limited, particularly with app-based approaches that require a

226

smartphone. It is encouraging that our results broadly align with other, larger-scale simulations of

227

contact tracing which explicitly model these limitations, but lack the fine-scale social tracking

228

data20. Therefore, by supplying a general framework for simulating the spread of COVID-19 on

229

real-world networks, we hope to promote integration of multiple real-world social tracking datasets

230

with epidemic modelling, which may provide a promising way forward for optimising contact tracing

231

strategies and other non-pharmaceutical interventions.

Methods

302
303

Social tracking data

304

The Haslemere dataset was generated and described as part of previous work, which gives

305

detailed description of the characteristics of this dataset and town 3,4. Briefly, the data were

306

collected during the 2017/18 BBC Pandemic project conducted in Haslemere, Surrey, UK. The

307

project involved a massive citizen-science experiment to collect social contact and movement data

308

using a custom-made phone app, and was designed to generate data relevant to understanding

309

directly transmitted infectious disease 3,4. Of the 1272 individuals within Haslemere that

310

downloaded the app, 468 individuals had sufficient data points at a resolution of 1m over three full

311

days within the focal area for further analysis3. All 468 focal individuals were known to have spent

312

>6hrs within 51.0132;-0.7731SW : 51.1195,-0.6432NE (within Postcode GU27), but the dataset

313

used here comprises of de-identified proximity data made available as pairwise distances (~1 m

314

resolution) at 5 min intervals (excluding 11pm-7am)3.

315
316

Social network construction

317

In our primary analysis, we defined social contacts as events when the average pairwise distances

318

between individuals within a 5 min time interval (calculated using the Haversine formula for great-

319

circle geographic distance3) are 4 m or less. By doing so, we aimed to capture the majority of

320

relevant face-to-face contacts (i.e. those that may result in transmission) over 5 min periods,

321

particularly given the 1 m potential error3 on the tracking measurement during these short time

322

intervals. Furthermore, this 4 m threshold is within typical mobile phone Bluetooth ranges for

323

relatively accurate and reliable detections. Therefore, this contact dataset will also be comparable

324

to proximity-based contacts identified through Bluetooth contact tracing apps, which may be

325

preferred to real-location tracking for privacy reasons. We considered the sensitivity of the network

326

to the contact definition by testing six further social networks from contacts defined using different

327

threshold distances spanning the conceivable potential transmission range within the 5 min

328

intervals (1 m to 7 m thresholds). We first measured the correlation of the network structure (i.e.

13

329

pairwise contacts) across the seven networks using Mantel tests. We also measured the

330

correlation of each individual's degree (number of contacts), clustering coefficient (number of

331

contacts also connected to one another), betweenness (number of shortest paths between nodes

332

that pass through an individual), and eigenvector centrality (a measure that accounts both for a

333

node's centrality and that of its neighbours) across the seven networks.

334
335

The Haslemere data is a temporal dataset spanning three full days. While the epidemic model we

336

use is dynamic (see below Methods), the contagion process of COVID-19 operates over a longer

337

time period than three days. To be able to meaningfully simulate longer-term outbreak dynamics,

338

we quantified the data as a static social network in which edges indicate the propensities for social

339

contact between nodes. Temporal information is incorporated by weighting the edges using the

340

temporal contact information, instead of using a dynamic network which would require contact data

341

over a much longer period. In the primary analysis, we weighted the edges as the number of

342

unique days a dyad was observed together (but see Supplementary Information for other temporal

343

definitions). Therefore, the weight score indicates the propensity for each dyad to engage in a

344

social contact event on any given day, whereby 0 = no contact, 1 = ‘weak links’ observed on the

345

minority of days (one third), 2 = ‘moderate links’ observed on the majority of days (two thirds), and

346

3 = ‘strong links’ observed on all days. In this way, the weights of this social network could be

347

included directly, and intuitively, into the dynamic epidemic model (see below). For sensitivity

348

analysis, we also created other weighings for this network, and examined the correlation in dyadic

349

social associations scores (using Mantel tests) with our primary weighting method (described

350

above). Specifically, for the sensitivity analysis, we used edges specified as i) a binary (i.e.

351

unweighted) network across all days, ii) a raw (and ranked) count of 5 min intervals in contact, iii) a

352

transformed weighted count (edge weight transformed as 1 − 𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 , which approximates

353

a scenario where infection risk increases with contact time, but begins to level off after ~30mins of

354

contact between dyads) and iv) a ‘simple ratio index’ (SRI) weighting that corrects for observation

355

number as SRI score28. The SRI score for any two individuals (i.e. A and B) is calculated as:

Null network simulation approach

363

We used null networks29 to understand the network properties that shape predictions of COVID-19

364

spread under different control scenarios. Null networks can also show how contagion may depend

365

on the arrangement of social ties, how it may operate in different social environments, and which

366

simulation approaches may be the most similar to real-world infection dynamics. We created four

367

null network scenarios (Extended Data Fig. 9) with 1000 networks generated under each of these.

368

All of the null network scenarios kept the same number of nodes, edges, and weights of these

369

edges, as the Haslemere network, but were generated under the following nulls: (1) ‘edge null’

370

(Extended Data Fig. 9A) considered random social associates, allowing the edges of the network

371

to be randomly allocated between all nodes; (2) ‘degree null’ (Extended Data Fig. 9B) considered

372

individual differences in sociality but random social links between dyads, so randomly swapped the

373

edges between nodes but maintained the degree distribution of the real network (and was,

374

therefore, even more conservative than a power-law network simulation aiming to match real

375

differences in sociality); (3) ‘lattice null’ (Extended Data Fig. 9C) considered triadic and tight clique

376

associations, so created a ring-like lattice structure through assigning all edges into a ring-lattice

377

where individuals are connected to their direct neighbours, and their neighbours of the second and

378

third order (i.e. six links per individual), and then we randomly removed excess links (until the

379

observed number of edges was reached); (4) ‘cluster null’ (Extended Data Fig. 9D) considered the

380

observed level of clustering, so created a ring-lattice structure as described above but only

381

between individuals observed as connected (at least 1 social link) in the real network, added

382

remaining links (sampled from 4th order neighbours), and then rewired the edges until the real-

383

world global clustering was observed (~20% rewiring; Extended Data Fig. 9D). These conservative

384

(and informed) null models allowed connections to be arranged differently within the network but

maintained the exact same number of individuals, social connections and weights of these social

386

connections at each simulation.

387
388

Epidemic model

389

Building on the epidemiological structure of a previous branching-process model13, we developed a

390

full epidemic model to simulate COVID-19 dynamics across the Haslemere network. Full model

391

parameters are given in Supplementary Table 1. For a given network of individuals, an outbreak is

392

seeded by randomly infecting a given number of individuals (default = 1). The model then moves

393

through daily time steps, with opportunities for infection on each day. All newly infected individuals

394

are assigned an ‘onset time’ drawn from a Weibull distribution (mean = 5.8 days) that determines

395

the point of symptom onset (for symptomatic individuals), and the point at which infectiousness is

396

highest (for all individuals)12. Each individual is then simultaneously assigned asymptomatic status

397

(whether they will develop symptoms at their onset time), as well as presymptomatic status

398

(whether or not they will infect before their assigned onset time), drawn from Bernoulli distributions

399

with defined probabilities (defaults = 0.4 and 0.2 respectively, see Supplementary Table 1). At the

400

start of each day, individuals are assigned a status of susceptible, infectious or recovered (which

401

would include deaths) based on their exposure time, onset time and recovery time (calculated as

402

onset time plus seven days), and are isolated or quarantined based on their isolation/quarantine

403

time (described below). The model then simulates infection dynamics over 70 days.

404
405

Possible infectors are all non-isolated and non-quarantined infectious individuals. Each day, all

406

susceptible, non-isolated, non-quarantined contacts of all infectors within the network are at risk of

407

being infected. The transmission rate for a given pair of contacts is modeled as:

where 𝑡 is the number of days since the infector i was exposed, 𝑠𝑖 and 𝑝𝑖 are the infector’s

413

factor for the infector’s symptomatic status (Supplementary Table 1) and 𝐼𝑒𝑖 is the weighting of the

414

edge in the network (i.e. number of days observed together) between the infector and the

415

susceptible individual. The probability density function 𝑓(𝑢; 𝜇𝑖 , 𝛼𝑝𝑖 , 𝜔𝑝𝑖 ) corresponds to the

416

generation time, which is drawn from a skewed normal distribution (see

417

uses the infector’s onset time as the location parameter 𝜇𝑖 , while the slant parameter 𝛼𝑝𝑖 and the

418

scale parameter 𝜔𝑝𝑖 both vary according to the infector’s presymptomatic transmission status

419

(Supplementary Table 1). This enabled us to simulate a predefined rate of presymptomatic

420

transmission, while retaining a correlation structure between onset time and infectiousness, and

421

avoiding a scenario whereby a large number of individuals were highly infectious on the first day of

422

exposure (see Supplementary Table 1 and data sharing for more details).

13

for details). Briefly, this

423
424

Using this transmission rate, the probability of infection between a susceptible-infected pair of

425

individuals t days after the infector’s exposure time is then modeled as:

426
427

(3)

𝑃(𝑡, 𝑠𝑖 , 𝑝𝑖 ) = 1 − 𝑒 −𝜆(𝑡,𝑠𝑖 ,𝑝𝑖)

428
429

Note that the change in status from “infectious” to “recovered” at seven days after symptom onset

430

does not affect infection dynamics (as transmission rate ≈ 0 seven days after onset time in our

431

model), but is instead used for contact tracing purposes (see below). To test how the above rate of

432

infection related to the reproduction number R0 and the observed generation times, we generated

433

empirical estimates of the number of secondary infections in the early outbreak stages of the

434

model. We ran 1000 trial simulations from a random single starting infector and quantified i) the

435

mean number of secondary infections from this case, and ii) the time at which each secondary

436

case was infected. We multiplied the rate of infection by a scaling parameter to get a baseline R0 of

437

2.8, although we also performed sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Table 1). The mean

438

generation time using this method was 6.3 days (median = 6 days). These basic parameters

439

correspond closely to published estimates12,30.

440
441

In addition to the infection rate from within the network, the infection rate from outside the network

442

is also simulated daily by randomly infecting susceptible individuals with a probability of 0.001

443

(although we also performed sensitivity analysis of this parameter).

444
445

We simulated different contact tracing scenarios using contact information from the network, with

446

the aim of evaluating both app-based and manual contact tracing strategies. Primary and

447

secondary contacts of individuals are identified from the network on the day of the infector’s

448

symptom onset and, as such, contacts of asymptomatic infectors are not traced. Contacts who

449

have already recovered are excluded. Susceptible contacts are traced with a given probability (0.3-

450

0.9 tested - see Supplementary Table 1). We assume that this probability captures a wide range of

451

reasons why contacts might not be traced, and it thus acts as an intuitive simplification.

452
453

The isolation and/or quarantine time of each individual is determined based on their infection

454

status, their symptomatic status, whether they have been traced, and the control scenario. We

455

consider four control scenarios: i) no control, where no individuals are isolated or quarantined, ii)

456

case isolation, where individuals isolate upon symptom onset after a delay period, iii) primary

457

contact tracing with quarantine, where individuals isolate upon symptom onset (after a delay) and

458

traced contacts are quarantined upon their infector’s symptom onset (also after a delay), and iv)

459

secondary contact tracing, as scenario iii) but including contacts of contacts. All isolated and

460

quarantined individuals are contained for 14 days.

461
462

Finally, we simulated a range of testing efforts for SARS-CoV-2. Each individual is assigned a

463

testing time on isolation or quarantine, with the delay between containment and testing sampled

464

from a Weibull distribution. A cap of the maximum number of daily tests is assigned, and each day

465

up to this number of individuals are randomly selected for testing. Test results are dependent on

466

infection and asymptomatic status, with a false negative rate (i.e. the probability that an infectious

467

case will test negative) 0.1 21, and a false positive rate (i.e. the probability that susceptible case will

469

470
471

A set of default parameters were chosen to represent a relatively optimistic model of contact

472

tracing, which included a short time delay between symptom onset/tracing and isolation/quarantine

473

(1-2 days), and a high proportion (90%) of contacts traced within this tracked population (default

474

parameters highlighted in bold in Supplementary Table 1). We assumed that the probability of

475

tracing was constant over time, and therefore independent of previous isolation/quarantine events,

476

and that all individuals remained in quarantine for the full 14 days, unless released via testing. We

477

performed sensitivity tests on all relevant parameters (Supplementary Table 1). To examine how

478

infection dynamics were affected by network structure, we ran epidemic simulations on each of the

479

null networks described above. We also ran simulations on networks generated using higher (7m

480

and 16m) distance thresholds for defining a contact. These networks were 20% and 100% more

481

dense, respectively, and therefore provide an estimate of the robustness of our simulations to

482

missing contacts.

483
484

We ran each simulation for 70 days, at which point the majority of new infections came from

485

outside the network (see results), with all scenarios replicated 1000 times. With the null networks

486

(above) and physical distancing simulations (below), we ran one replicate simulation on each of

487

1000 simulated networks. In no simulations were all individuals in the population infected under our

488

default settings. Therefore, for each simulation we report the number of cases per week, and

489

quantify the total number of cases after 70 days as a measure of outbreak severity. To present the

490

level of isolation and quarantine required under different scenarios, we calculate the number of

491

people contained on each day of the outbreak, and average this ove weeks to get weekly changes

492

in the daily rates of isolations and quarantines.

495

We simulated a population-level physical distancing effort, whereby a given proportion of the ‘weak

496

links’ are removed (edges only observed on a single day; Extended Data Fig. 10A-D). This is akin

497

to a simple situation whereby individuals reduce their non-regular contacts (e.g. to people outside

498

of their household or other frequently visited settings such as workplaces). As further

499

supplementary analysis, we also carried out a more complex physical distancing simulation,

500

whereby the weak links that were removed were randomly reassigned to existing contacts

501

(Extended Data Fig. 10E-G). This represents a scenario where individuals reduce their non-regular

502

contacts but spend more time with regular contacts.

Table 1 Policy summary
Background

Understanding how isolation, contact tracing and other nonpharmaceutical interventions can combine effectively and
efficiently is crucial to COVID-19 control. Such interventions are
likely to depend on contact patterns within a population. We
developed an epidemic model that simulates COVID-19
outbreaks in a real-world network, and assess the impact of a
range of testing, isolation, quarantine and contact tracing
strategies for controlling these outbreaks.

Main findings and limitations

We found that isolation, contact tracing and quarantine reduced
simulated outbreak size in our local-scale network. Tracing and
quarantining contacts of contacts was more effective, but
required large numbers of individuals are required to be
quarantined. This strategy is therefore often similar to
introducing a ‘local lockdown’. Testing and releasing
quarantined individuals reduced the numbers quarantined, but
also the effectiveness of control measures. Combining physical
distancing with contact tracing resulted in reduced outbreak
size, with fewer individuals required to quarantine. A major
limitation of this study is that it is based on pre-COVID-19 data
from a sample of individuals from a single town; more data are
therefore needed to fully understand potential outbreak
dynamics in other settings.

Policy implications

Our findings suggest that effective contact tracing measures
may require large numbers of people in a community to be
quarantined, with individual-level tracing resulting in scenarios
equivalent to broader localised lockdowns. Targeted tracing
and quarantine strategies may therefore be more efficient when
combined with other control measures such as physical
distancing.
