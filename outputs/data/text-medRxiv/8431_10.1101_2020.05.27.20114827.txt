Abstract
Importance: Multiple sclerosis patients have been considered a higher-risk population for
COVID-19 due to the high prevalence of disability and disease-modifying therapy use; however,
no study has identified clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis associated with worse
COVID-19 outcomes.
Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree
of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from
COVID-19.
Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with
COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020.
Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S.
Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal
PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection.
Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability
status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy.
Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course,
where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate
severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and
most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death.
Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16/40(40%) were male, and
21/40(52.5%) were African American. 19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had

moderate courses, and 6/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses
were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5]
years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of
progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses
(severe:2/6[33.3%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0%]secondary-progressing,
moderate:1/14[7.14%] and 5/14[35.7%] vs mild:0/19[0%] and 1/19[5.26%], P=0.0075, 1
unknown). Significant disability was found in 1/19(5.26%) mild course-patients, but was in
9/15(60%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2/6(33.3%, P=0.200) of severe coursepatients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses
(mild:17/19[89.5%], moderate:12/15[80%] and severe:3/6[50%], P=0.123).
Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses
tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree
of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.

Introduction
Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are four times more likely to succumb to serious infection
when compared to the general population, making them potentially at higher-risk from the
ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 This may be because a significant number of
MS patients have a high level of disability and are on immunosuppressive disease-modifying
therapies (DMTs). Most information regarding the association of MS characteristics and DMTusage with COVID-19 comes from case-reports and case-series surveys.2,3 In this prospective
cohort study we looked at the MS disease characteristics with differing COVID-19 severity.
Methods:
Study Design: We enrolled 40 consecutive MS patients with confirmed COVID-19 via
nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal-PCR from 3 different hospital systems in the U.S, Henry Ford
Hospital Systems (HFHS) in Detroit, MI, Detroit Medical Center (DMC) in Detroit MI, and
University of Chicago (UOC) in Chicago, IL (28 at HFHS, 4 at DMC and 8 at UOC) between
March 1st and May 18th. Study was approved by each institution review board (IRB).
Data Collection: We obtained information regarding age, race, sex, smoking status, MS stage
(Primary Progressive MS, PPMS; Relapsing-Remitting MS, RRMS; Secondary Progressive MS,
SPMS), duration of MS, DMT, and comorbidities. Extended disability status scale (EDSS) was
used for disability assessment with > 6.0 indicating severe disability.4,5 Symptoms and labs at
presentation were also included in the analysis. Days of COVID-19 symptoms was a patientreported metric.
Outcome: Clinical severity of COVID-19 was based on hospital course: mild course was
defined as not requiring hospital admission, moderate course was defined as requiring admission

to general floor only, and most severe course was defined as requiring intensive care unit (ICU)
admission and/or death.6
Statistical Analysis: R-version 3.6.3 was used for statistical analysis. Continuous variables
were reported as median with interquartile ranges (median[IQR]). Categorical variables were
reported as counts (percentages). Lab data was expressed as frequency of elevated labs using cut
off values (Supplement Table 1) and median[IQR]. Continuous variables were compared using
Kruskal-Wallis-H test with post hoc Dunn’s test for pairwise-comparisons. Due to small sample
size, proportions of categorical variables were compared using Chi-squared test with MonteCarlo simulation with 2000 replicates.7 Then Fisher multiple-pairwise tests were used for post
hoc comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments.8 Differences among COVID-19 courses
and pair-wise comparisons were considered statistically significant if P-value or adjusted P-value
was less than 0.05.

Results
20/40(50%) patients were admitted, of which 5/20(25%) patients required ICU admission.
4/20(20%) were ventilated, 3/20(15%) died, and 1/20(5%) made a full recovery. One ICU patient
only required continuous positive airway pressure and made a full recovery. One patient died on
arrival at the emergency department, a total of 4/40(10%) of patients, while all other patients
recovered (36/40[90%]).
19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6(15%) had severe
courses. Moderate (57[50-63 years old) and severe (66[58.8-69.5] course-patients were
significantly older than mild (48[40-51.5]) course-patients (P=0.0121, P=0.0373 respectively).

Moderate course-patients were more likely to be smokers compared to mild course-patients
(5/14[35.7%] vs 0/19[0%], P=0.0253).
There was differing prevalence of progressive forms of MS among courses of COVID-19
(severe: 2/6[33.3%]PPMS and 0/6[0%]SPMS; moderate:1/14[7.14%]PPMS and
5/14[35.7%]SPMS vs mild: 0/19[0%]PPMS and 1/19[5.26%]SPMS, P=0.0075, 1 unknown).
Moderate course-patients tended to have MS longer than patients with mild and severe courses
(16[11.5-27] years vs 11[6-14.5] years and 5[3-10] years, P=0.0480, P=0.283).(Table 1a)
EDSS was ≥ 6.0 in 1/19(5.26%) with the mild course, significantly less than that with moderate
courses (9/15[60%], P=0.00435). This was also less than that seen in severe course-patients,
though not statistically significant (2/6[33.3%], P=0.200). More patients with moderate courses
were residents of nursing homes compared to those with mild courses (7/15[46.7%] vs 0/19[
0%], P=0.0036).
There was a relatively higher prevalence of DMT use in patients with mild and moderate courses
compared to those with severe courses, although not found to be statistically significant across
groups; 17/19[89.5%] and 12/15[80%] vs. 3/6[50%], P=0.123). Percentages of different types of
DMT appeared to be similar across courses. (Figure 1)
There were more patients with moderate courses who had hypertension compared to that seen in
those with mild courses (10/15[66.7%] vs 3/19[15.8%], P=0.0127). There were more patients
with severe courses who had diabetes compared to that seen in those with mild courses
(4/6[66.7%] vs 1/19[5.26%], P=0.005).(Table 1b)
Overall, initial presenting symptoms were similar among each course of COVID-19.(Table 1c)
All moderate and severe courses, as expected, had chest X-ray obtained compared to only

2/19(10.5%) patients with mild courses( P=0.0005). Patients with severe courses had
quantifiably higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 598[402-807]IU/L vs 312[245394]IU/L, P=0.0452). Patients with moderate and severe courses were more likely to be treated
for COVID-19 compared to those with mild courses (12/15[80%] and 5/6[83.3%]
vs4/19[21.1%], P=0.00429, P=0.0178).(Table 1c)
All admitted patients were not given DMTs during admission. Duration of COVID-19 symptoms
was similar among all courses(P=0.304). Patients with severe courses were more likely to be
admitted longer compared to those with moderate courses (15.5[14.2-16.8] days vs 4[4-9.5]
days, P=0.00601).(Table 1e)
Discussion
MS is a heterogeneous disease as PPMS and SPMS are associated with a later age of onset when
compared to RRMS, thus patients tend to be older with more disablities.9,10 Older age, certain
comorbidities and living in nursing homes are significant risk factors for COVID-19.11 Indeed,
MS patients with moderate-severe courses were more likely to have progressive disease,
comorbidities (smoking, hypertension, and diabetes), and EDSS scores > 6.0. These patients also
tended to be older and frequently resided in nursing homes.
It is known that certain DMTs have higher infectious risk compared to others; therefore, it has
been a concern that cell depleting DMTs would be associated with higher COVID-19 risk.12
However, in our cohort, there doesn’t appear to be bias regarding certain DMTs in moderatesevere courses. In fact, it appears that more patients with moderate and severe courses were not
on any DMT compared to that seen in those with mild courses. DMTs have been hypothesized to
attenuate the cytokine-storm response in COVID-19, though this is still purely speculative.12

Overall, usage of DMTs do not necessarily appear to be associated with more severe COVID-19courses. These findings correspond to those in ongoing North American COVID-19 MS survey
database (covidms.org) and Italian cohort surveyed by Sormani el al. where patients who died
tended to be older, have PPMS or SPMS, and have significant disability and comorbidities, but
were less likely to be on DMT.3,13
As of 5/25/2020, the Detroit Health Department has reported a 12.3% citywide COVID-19
mortality rate among laboratory confirmed cases.14 Although, we had a small sample size, our
MS cohort reported a similar mortality rate and was like that reported by Sormani et al. in
confirmed-COVID-19 positive MS patients (5/57[8.78%]).3 Therefore, we can assume our
mortality rate could be consistent with a larger sample size and similar to that of the general
population.
A significant limitation to our study is the relatively small sample size collected; therefore riskstratification adjusting for confounders was not possible. Larger studies are therefore required in
order to improve for confounding variables. Also, there was a significant discrepancy in samplesize for each course, as there were only 6 patients with severe disease course. Therefore,
significant differences may not have been detected in post hoc comparisons with this course.
Regardless, we showed that certain MS-characteristics were more frequent in more COVID-19
severe courses.
