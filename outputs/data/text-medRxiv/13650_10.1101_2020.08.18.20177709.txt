The infection of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. In order to avoid
excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine based on
a realistic model is expected. Several epidemic models with a quarantine
compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered
(SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the
infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the
infectious stage.
This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay
of quarantine. The latency period (compartment E) and the incubation period
were assumed to be 3 days and 5 days, respectively. Considering that the
presymptomatic infection ratio is 0.4, the natural decay rate of the number of
infectious patients was assumed to be 0.25 days-1. The recovery rate was
assumed to be 0.07 days-1 from the typical PCR test positive period. The PCR
test positive number in the period from March 10 to July 18 in 2020 in Tokyo
area was analyzed. The delay time distribution of the quarantine was derived
from the record of the symptom onset date, and was utilized to determine the
delay time profile of quarantine in the model.
It was found that the major contributor to the infection control was the
restraint of social contact. However, the quarantine action also contributed to
reducing the reproduction number by the ratio of 0.88 and 0.8 in the period from
March 10 to June 3 and from June 4 to July 18, respectively. The delay of
quarantine was found to be well correlated to the effectiveness of quarantine.
Therefore, a record on a symptom onset date is very important to estimate the
effect of quarantine measure. The basic reproduction number was estimated to
be 2.56. In view of the presymptomatic infection ratio 0.4, it would be very hard
to restrain the expansion of infection only by quarantining the symptomatic
patients.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused the infection
expansion all over the world in the second quarter of 2020. A deterministic
mathematical modeling of the outbreak of infection is expected to be a useful
tool to analyze the situation and to suggest a plausible measure. In the SIR
model [1], the total population N of the area under consideration is divided into
three compartments: susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals.
In the SEIR model [2], another compartment, exposed individuals (E), is added
to take a latency period into account. However, COVID-19 is different from
most conventional infection cases in the point that unique symptom is not well
established yet and that asymptomatic patients may be infectious [3],[4]. Since
an infectious patient cannot be identified clearly, we have to restrain contact
between the others in daily life. Influence to social activities is enormous. It is
necessary to find and quarantine an infectious patient by some kind of test, and
this quarantine measure deeply affects the situation of the infection expansion.
Models with a compartment for quarantined individuals are called SIQR
model [5] or SEIQR model [6],[7],[8]. The occurrence of the transition from the
component I to Q, which is observed as a number of newly found infected
patients, is usually assumed to be proportional to the number of infectious
patients at large, and this proportionality coefficient is treated as a parameter
called "quarantine rate". The outbreak of COVID-19 has been analyzed by many
authors in terms of quarantine [9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14]. The quarantine rate
was estimated from available data under some simple assumptions or using
statistical method [10] or AI model [11]. However, infected patients usually have
a PCR examination after developing a symptom. Moreover when a check system
is not well coordinated, they have to stand by for several days. Young et al.
developed a delayed SEIQR model [15] including this delay effect, which was
applied to COVID-19 by Vysarayani and Chatterjee [16]. In their model, the
patient that has passed an assumed period is quarantined with an assumed
probability, but if not quarantined, a chance of being quarantined is not left any
longer. On the other hand, Utamura et al. [17] developed a model in that all the
infectious patients are quarantined after passing an assumed period (14 days).
In this report, I will present a new model with two compartments of infectious
patients: a quarantine waiting compartment and a quarantine possible
compartment. Patients are quarantined with a quarantine rate only in the latter
compartment. The quarantine rate defined in this model is a natural extension of
that of non-delayed SIQR or SEIQR models.

In the next section, a delayed SEIQR model will be formulated. In Section 3,
the data of the daily found PCR positive patients in Tokyo area [18] will be
analyzed. The last section will be devoted to a discussion and conclusion.
2.

A delayed SEIQR model

In this section, a delayed SEIQR model will be formulated. As a compartment
model, this model is similar to the delayed SEIQR model proposed by Young et
al. [15]. As Young's model, I assumed that a patient stays in the compartment E
for a definite period ε. As for the compartment I, which is the point of difference
to Young's model, this compartment was divided into J and K, and only those
belonging to K were assumed to be quarantined. The patient stays in the
compartment J for a period τ and automatically moves to the compartment K.
Here, a quarantine rate q was introduced as an extension of that of non-delayed
SIQR or SEIQR model. All the members in K were assumed to be continuously
quarantined with a rate q if not recovered. The parameter τ means a delay of the
start of quarantine. If we expand the test to check earlier stage patient, τ can be
decreased. In the case of non-delayed models (τ=0), a constant value is imposed
on q for the whole stage of an infectious patient at large. The flow chart is
shown in Fig.1.

Thus, the delay differential equations are given as follows. (The time
dependence of coefficients β and q is not indicated for simplicity. )

(2.8)

The parameters β, γ, q, ε, and τ represent the transmission rate, the natural decay
rate of the number of infectious patients, the quarantine rate, the latency period,
and the delay of the start of quarantine, respectively. The transmission rate may
be interpreted as the frequency of daily contact with others multiplied by the
transmission risk from an encountered infectious patient. Birth and death
processes are neglected here. The factor exp(-γτ) in Eqs. (2.3) and (2.4) is
necessary to take into account the decay with the rate γ in the compartment J.
It should be noted here that the PCR test positive result does not always mean
infectiousness because PCR test does not detect active virus but detects only
RNA [19],[20]. The recovery rate, denoted as γ', is defined here as the inverse of
the averaged PCR test positive period. This rate is smaller than the natural decay
rate γ of the number of infectious patients. Thus we have to assume similar
compartments J' and K' for PCR test positive patients as an extension of J and K,
respectively. The number of PCR test positive patients in the compartment K',
denoted as K'(t), satisfies the following additional delay differential equation.

(2.9)

Then the number of the newly found PCR test positive patient is
∆Q(t ) = qK ' (t )

(2.10)

When the parameters are made ε =0, τ= 0, ε = τ= 0, τ =q=0, and ε = τ =q=0,
this model becomes a delayed SIQR model, an SEIQR model, an SIQR model,
an SEIR model, and an SIR model respectively.

Hereafter, I will consider only the early stage of outbreak. I made an
approximation as S=N, and only Eqs. (2.3), (2.4), (2.7), (2.9), and (2.10) will be
used. These equations are rewritten as
d I (t )
= β I (t − ε ) − q K (t ) − γ I (t )
dt
d K (t )
= β I (t − τ − ε )e −γ τ − q K (t ) − γ K (t )

= β I (t − τ − ε )e −γ ' τ − q K ' (t ) − γ ' K ' (t )
dt

(2.11)
(2.12)
(2.13)

Next, I will establish the relation of the model parameters to the actual
epidemic data. In addition to the PCR test positive fixation date Tf, the epidemic
data usually contain the symptom onset date Ts if the patient is symptomatic.
The delay of quarantine is defined as Td=Tf−Ts+Tp, where Tp is the
presymptomatic infectious period. (I will assume later that Tp=2 days.) In order
to derive the expression of the distribution function of Td, we have to calculate
the probability P(t) that a patient who became infectious at t=0 is not
quarantined while keeping PCR test positive. Since the decay rate is γ' before the
start of quarantine (t<τ), and then γ'+q if t>τ.

P (t ) = e −γ ' t

if t < τ ,

P (t ) = e −γ ' τ e − (γ ' + q )(t −τ ) if t ≥ τ

(2.14)

The probability of daily quarantine in the PCR test is given by qP(t) ( t ≥ τ ),
which is rewritten as
qP (t ) = p qϕ (t )

where ϕ (t ) = 0

(2.15)
if t < τ ,

ϕ (t ) = (γ '+ q )e − (γ ' + q )(t −τ ) if t ≥ τ

(2.16)

qe −γ 'τ
pq =
(γ '+ q )

(2.17)

The function φ(t) and the coefficient pq are interpreted as the normalized
distribution of the delay time of quarantine and the ratio of the PCR test
detection of infected patient, respectively. It should be noted that φ(t) can be
observed, but pq cannot be observed directly. Although the observed quarantine
delay distribution is different from the distribution φ(t) of the model, the most

(2.19)

These equations determine τ and q.
If we replace γ' with γ, P(t) will be the probability that an infected patient is
not quarantined while maintaining infectiousness. The effective reproduction
number Re is given by carrying out the time integration of P(t) (Eq.(2.14) where
γ' is replaced with γ) multiplied by β.

The second term in the parenthesis { } means the ratio of the infectious patient
detected and quarantined by the PCR test. The ratio Re/(β/γ) may be interpreted
as the effect of quarantine when excluding the social contact avoidance effect.
This ratio is expressed in terms of the characteristic parameters of the
distribution of the delay of quarantine.

reproduction number is estimated as R0=β/γ using the earliest value in β.

There is a stationary solution proportional to exp(λt) in Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12).
The coefficient λ is called the infection expansion coefficient, and it satisfies the
following relation, which will be useful not only in finding β from the observed
time profile of infection but also in predicting the expansion rate λ.

The left hand side may be interpreted as an effective transmission rate, which
depends on the latency period ε. If the infection is expanding (λ>0) or shrinking
(λ<0), the effective transmission rate is reduced or enhanced, respectively.
3. Analysis of the time profile of infection in Tokyo area
In this section, I will analyze the data of the number of PCR test positive
person who were living and tested in Tokyo area (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama,
and Chiba) [18]. The test period is from March 10 to July 18 in 2020. The total
number of patients is 13,978. The parameters γ, γ', and ε will be estimated from
references, and the parameters τ and q will be derived from the observed
quarantine delay distribution. Finally, the parameter β will be chosen so as to
reproduce the time profile of the number of PCR test positive patients.
The incubation period has a wide distribution and the average is about 5 days
[21]. It is also known that patients are infectious 2 days before the onset of
symptom [3],[4]. Thus, I assumed that the latency period ε is 3 days. I assumed

that the natural decay rate γ of the number of infectious patients is 0.25 days-1 so
as to make the ratio of presymptomatic infection 0.4 as observed [3],[4]. Since
the PCR test positive period has a wide distribution [22],[23], I assumed 14 days
as a typical period. The recovery rate γ' was set to be 1/14=0.07 days-1. The time
profile of probability of being infectious is compared with that of being PCR test
positive in Fig.3.

Figure 3. Comparison of infectious and PCR test positive time profiles

The symptom onset date (Ts) was recorded in 24% of the data of Tokyo area
[18]. The daily average of the delay of quarantine (Td=Tf−Ts+Tp) is shown in
Fig.4. Although the data are scattered, the delay in June and July is apparently
shorter than that in March, April, and May. I divided the whole period at the
point between June 3 and 4.

Figure 4. Daily profile of the delay of quarantine
The delay of the quarantine is defined as the period from the start of infectiousness to the PCR test positive
fixation day. It is assumed here that the start of infectiousness is 2 days earlier than the onset of symptom.

The distributions of the delay of quarantine in these periods are shown in Fig.5.
The average (<Td>) and the standard deviation (σ) of the delay is 9.17 days and
4.24 days respectively in the former period, and 6.69 days and 3.08 days
respectively in the latter period. The parameters τ, q, and the effect of quarantine
(Re/(β/γ)) were calculated by Eqs. (2.18), (2.19), and (2.20). The result was that
τ=4.93 days, q=0.166 days-1, and Re/(β/γ)=0.884 in the former period, while

τ=3.6 days and q=0.25 days-1, and Re/(β/γ)=0.795 in the latter period. These are
indicated by two small circles in Fig.2. (In the case of the exact expression (Eq.
(2.22)), Re/(β/γ)=0.879 and Re/(β/γ)=0.792 in the former and the latter period,
respectively. This means that the present model is a good approximation.) Since
a small change of parameters does not affect the result much as far as the effect
of quarantine is the same, I applied a common value of τ=4 days for a
convenience on the numerical calculation, and q was readjusted so as to keep the
effect of quarantine. I obtained the values as q=0.116 and q=0.314 for the former
and the latter period, respectively. If we set that τ=0: i.e. in the case of nondelayed model, q=0.039 days-1 and Re/(β/γ)=0.865 in the former period,
q=0.0795 and Re/(β/γ)= 0.759 in the latter period. The delay time profiles in the
two cases (τ=4 and τ=0) are compared with the observed profiles in Fig.5.

Figure 5. Distribution of the delay of quarantine

Numerical calculation was made by the fourth order Runge-Kutta method
with time step=0.1 days. The PCR test positive person number data of Tokyo
area ΔQ(t) in the period from March 10 to July 18 [18] was reproduced by
choosing the parameter β. The time profile of infection is shown in Fig.6. The
parameters β and q and the effective reproduction number Re in each period are
listed in Table 1. As for the parameters β and q, the moving average of 7 days of
the values in Table 1 was adopted as shown in Fig.6. The small protuberance in
ΔQ(t) around June 3 reflects the change in the parameter q (the enhancement of
PCR test). The basic reproduction number R0 is found to be 0.640/0.25=2.56.

The reduction ratio of the reproduction number is a product of the social
action inhibiting effect (β/0.640) and the quarantine effect (Re/(β/γ)). They are
shown in Table.1. The effect of the social behavior restraint is dominant on the
whole. It is remarkable in the period b and c in particular. Death of a famous
comedy actor was reported, and people checked social behavior. An emergency
declaration was issued, and social contact restraint of 80% was recommended.
After the emergency declaration was released, β increased in the period d and e,
but the PCR check system has been strengthened by period e by the ratio
0.204/0.115=1.77. This eased infection expansion. The time profile of infection
after those periods is not shown here. The social behavior was limited again, and
infection calmed down a little throughout August and September. However, in
view of the economical influence, the quarantine action should be strengthened.

In order to grasp the situation, the curves which make the infection expansion
rate λ fixed (Eqs. (2.18), (2.19), and (2.23)) are drawn in the plane of β and <Td>
in Fig.7. (Note that λ=−0.05 or −0.1 means 30% or 50% decrease of infection a
week, respectively.) Since there is a small dependence on σ, the two extreme
cases are drawn. One is the case that q=∞ (σ=0; i.e. <Td>=τ), the other is the
case that τ=0 (<Td>=σ: i.e. non-delayed SEIQR model). The result of the
analysis in Tokyo area is indicated by the grey dots. As an example, let us start
from the period e. If the quarantine measure is the same, we have to restrain the
social activity by 35% to get over the λ=0 line (β=0.31 day-1), but if the
quarantine measure could be strengthened as that <Td>=4 days, only 16%
reduction of β would be sufficient to get over the λ=0 line (β=0.4 day-1). The
economic impact would be much mitigated. However, when only the
symptomatic patient is quarantined, <Td> cannot be made shorter than 2 days.
This also means that Re cannot be made less than 1.04=0.4R0, if we recover the
level of social activity before the outbreak of COVID-19. (The number 0.4 is the
presymptomatic ratio of infection.) Thus the quarantine of presymptomatic
patient is necessary.

Figure 7. Infection expansion rate
The curves which make infection expansion rate λ =−0.1, −0.05, 0, 0.05, 0.1 are depicted in two cases. One
is the case that q=∞ (σ=0), the other is the case that τ=0 (<Td>=σ).

4. Summary and discussion
Conventional SIQR or SEIQR (non-delayed) models assume that the number
of quarantined patients daily is proportional to the number of infectious patients

at large. As shown by thin lines in Fig.5, this supposition is equivalent to
assuming an exponential distribution of the quarantine delay from the beginning
of infectiousness. However, the observed delay time distribution looks very
different from that assumed in these models. In order to reflect the essential
characteristics of the distribution, I expanded conventional SEIQR models with
a new parameter τ describing the delay of the start of quarantine. I also estimated
the natural decay rate γ of the number of infectious patients from the observed
ratio of presymptomatic infection. The decay rate was found to be much larger
than usual estimates from medical recovery data. Then I introduced a recovery
rate γ' as the inverse of a PCR test positive period to reproduce the observed
PCR test positive number.
I found that the quarantine effect on the reduction of the effective
reproduction number is closely related to the averaged delay of quarantine as is
shown in Fig.2. This means that we can estimate the effect of quarantine
measure directly. (The exact relation is given in Eq. (2.22).) Although this
estimation from the averaged delay is also possible in the non-delayed models,
the estimation itself tends to be rather optimistic. It should also be noted that, in
the non-delayed models, a prediction in terms only of β and q might become too
optimistic because the difficulty of shortening the delay of quarantine is often
underestimated.
The infection expansion or shrinking can be predicted in Fig.7, where the
infection expansion rate λ is expressed in terms of the transmission rate β and
the averaged delay of quarantine <Td>. As a point of the infection measure, I
share a view with He et al. [3] and Chun et al. [4]. The quarantine of
presymptomatic patient is necessary to recover the normal social activities.
This report has the following limitations.
1. I did not distinguish asymptomatic patients from presymptomatic patients.
The data of asymptomatic case are very limited [22],[23],[24]. If both of its
proportion and infectiousness are not negligible, it is necessary to take into
account the difficulty of checking the asymptomatic case. One of the methods
was developed in Appendix A, where some portion of patients can be left
unchecked.
2. I assumed that the time profile of the onset of transmission (infectiousness) is
an exponential type distribution. Actually it is estimated that there is a peak
around the symptom onset time [3],[4]. This might affect the result when the
average of quarantine delay is as short as the period of presymptomatic
infectionon (2 days).
3. The symptom onset date was recorded only in 24% of the data. This loss of

data might have an influence on the result of the estimation of the quarantine
effect. Especially, I am afraid that there may be a tendency of forgetting to
record the symptom onset date in the case of presymptomatic patient found
by contact tracing. There would be a possibility of underestimate of the
quarantine effect if the quarantine measure is further strengthened in future. A
correct record on a symptom onset date is important to evaluate the
quarantine effect.

Appendix A: Exact evaluation of the quarantine effect and the effective
reproduction number
In order to reproduce exactly the same quarantine delay distribution as the
observed one, we have to construct a different epidemic model similar to
Young's model [15]. The compartment of infectious patient I and that of the PCR
test positive patient I' are divided into many compartments Jτ and J'τ, respectively.
The suffix τ means that all the members in that compartment are quarantined
when τ days passed (corresponding to the case that σ=0 in the main text). (I do
not need the compartment K nor K'.) In this report, I discarded the difficulty of
checking asymptomatic patients. If we take that difficulty into account, we have
to include a compartment with τ=∞. Equations (2.3),(2.4),(2,7) and (2.9) are
replaced by the following equations.

, where Jτ denotes the number of the infectious patients and J'τ denotes that of the
PCR test positive patients in the compartments Jτ and J'τ, respectively. The
parameter pτ means the ratio of patients entering the compartment Jτ and J'τ. With
an approximation that S=N, if a patient enters the compartment Jτ and J'τ at t=0,
the probability of being infectious without being quarantined is exp(−γt), and
that of being PCR test positive is exp(−γ't). Thus, the effective reproduction

Equation (2.22) is obtained by assuming that p∞=0.
When the expansion coefficient λ is estimated from the time profile of the
number of daily PCR test positive persons, the transmission coefficient β can be
calculated from the following equation corresponding to Eq. (2.23).

Therefore, knowing the time profile of the number of daily PCR test positive
persons and that of the delay of quarantine, and neglecting the influence of
asymptomatic infectious patients (p∞=0), we can derive directly the effective
reproduction number using Eqs. (A.7) and the following equation.
