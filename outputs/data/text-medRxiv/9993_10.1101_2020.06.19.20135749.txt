ABSTRACT

Background
Evidence for the impact of COVID-19 during the second and the third trimester of pregnancy is limited to a relatively
small series, while data on the first trimester are scant. With this study we evaluated COVID-19 infection as a risk
factor for spontaneous abortion in first trimester of pregnancy.

Methods
Between February 22 and May 21, 2020, we conducted a case-control study at S. Anna Hospital, Turin, among first
trimester pregnant women, paired for last menstruation. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was compared
between women with spontaneous abortion (case group, n=100) and those with ongoing pregnancy (control group,
n=125). Current or past infection was determined by detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharingeal swab and SARSCoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies in blood sample. Patient demographics, COVID-19-related symptoms, and the main risk
factors for abortion were collected.

Findings
Twenty-three (10.2%) of the 225 women tested positive for COVID-19 infection. There was no difference in the
cumulative incidence of COVID-19 between the cases (11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (p=0.73).
Logistic regression analysis confirmed that COVID-19 was not an independent predictor of abortion (1.28 confidence
interval 0.53-3.08).

Interpretation
COVID-19 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy does not appear to predispose to abortion; its cumulative
incidence did not differ from that of women with ongoing pregnancy.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) named the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease coronavirus disease-19
(COVID-19) and declared it a pandemic. Coronaviruses are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA usually
responsible for mild illness such as the common cold in adults and children.1 But in the last decade, coronaviruses have
caused two important epidemics: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019 followed by outbreaks across
the world.2 The first cases of COVID-19 in Italy were confirmed in January 2020, with a rapid rise in the number of
cases in northern Italy starting in late February.
Despite the rapidly growing number of cases worldwide, data on COVID-19 during pregnancy remain limited, being
derived mainly from small sample studies.3–8 A systematic review of published reports on coronaviruses (COVID-19,
SARS, MERS) reported higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean section, and perinatal death.9 The lack of
data on abortion due to COVID-19 during the first trimester precludes extrapolation of conclusive evidence for the
effects of infection during early pregnancy. The paucity of reliable data has aroused concern in patients, while the
disinformation reported by media may lead pregnant women to embrace dramatic choices such as voluntary abortion.10
The wide of clinical expression, the high rate of asymptomatic forms, the poor accuracy of nasopharyngeal swab testing
and its limited availability have been the main barriers to gaining a real understanding of the prevalence of the infection
and its impact on pregnancy. In this complex scenario, the development of serological tests for the detection of SARSCoV-2 IgG and IgM could be useful to identify pregnant patients who were infected during early pregnancy. While the
quantity and quality of data on test performance are still limited, the level of accuracy has been reportedly
moderate/good, so that patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can be traced.11
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on first trimester spontaneous abortion by
comparing the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of women who experienced early abortion
and that of women with ongoing pregnancy at 12 weeks of gestational age.

Materials and methods
Women who had been referred to our Hospital for first trimester spontaneous abortion care between February 22 and
May 21, 2020 were contacted and enrolled (case group). Women 12 weeks pregnant admitted to our Hospital for fetal
nuchal translucency between April 16 and May 21, 2020 were the control group. The first reported case of COVID-19
infection in Piedmont was dated February 22, 2020. To exclude the possibility of COVID-19 seroconversion before
pregnancy, only women with last menstruation before that date were considered eligible for inclusion (Fig. 1). This
criterion allowed us to define seropositivity in the case group as a seroconversion that had occurred during pregnancy.
Blood tests were performed for the detection of IgG/IgM non neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays on nasopharingeal swabs. Patients testing positive at least one
test were also tested for the determination of specific neutralizing antibodies. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000
rpm for 5 min to separate serum and analyzed the same day of collection.
A rapid automated fluorescent lateral flow CE-approved immunoassay (AFIAS™ COVID-19, Boditech, Gang-won-do,
Korea) was used for qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of IgG/IgM non neutralizing antibodies against the
spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) viral proteins; semi-quantitative results are expressed as the cut-off index (COI) in
which a COI > 1.1 indicates a positive result. Chemiluminescence CE-approved immunoassay (CLIA) technology was
used for the semi-quantitative determination of anti-S1 and anti-S2 specific IgG neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
(Liaison® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy): the antibody concentration is expressed as arbitrary

units (AU/mL) and grades the results as positive when ≥ 15 AU/mL. Viral RNA extraction from the swab was
performed on a MagNA Pure compact instrument (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and analyzed using a RT-PCR assay
(CFX-96, Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) with the Liferiver Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCov real-time RT-PCR kit protocol,
targeting genes N, E, and ORF1ab (Liferiver Bio-Tech, San Diego, CA, USA).
Sample size calculation was not possible because the expected prevalence of disease was unknown at the time of
population enrollment and further recruitment beyond May 21 would have precluded the eligibility criterion for last
menstruation.
Demographics, COVID-19-related symptoms, and data on exposure to possible risk factors for abortion were collected
by interview. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the City of Health and Science of Turin
(Reference number: 00171/2020). Written, informed consent was obtained from all participants. The results for
quantitative variables are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) and qualitative categorical variables are
expressed as frequency and percentages. Comparison of quantitative variables was performed using the t-test or
Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test based on normal or not distribution, respectively. Qualitative variables were compared
using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. When basic patient characteristics were present as
confounding factors, regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between COVID-19 infection and
spontaneous abortion. Results are expressed as odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]). Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS software ver. 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Carey, NC, USA).

Results
A total of 225 women at first trimester of pregnancy, attending our Institute were included in the study. One hundred
women in the case group and 125 women in the control group were enrolled. The patient adhesion rate was 87%
(100/115) and 88% (125/142), respectively. Table 1 presents the patients’ characteristics at baseline; except for age,
there were no statistically significant differences in demographics or risk factors for abortion between the two groups.
Twenty-three of the 225 women tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were found to be seropositive or
their nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for COVID-19, yielding an overall cumulative incidence of 10.2% in the first
trimester. There was no significant difference in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 between the case patients
(11/100, 11%) and the controls (12/125, 9.6%) (p=0.73).
The age variable was entered into logistic regression analysis to evaluate COVID-19 infection in relation to
confounders. There was no difference in the odd of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 between the two groups,
indicating that COVID-19 infection was not an independent predictor of abortion (1.282, CI 0.53-3.08).
In the case group, 5/11 (45.4%), 3/11 (27.2%), and 1/11 (9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, SARS-CoV-2 IgM,
or both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, respectively; RT-PCR of the nasopharingeal swab resulted positive in 2/11 (18%)
(Table 2). In the control group, 7/12 (58.3%), 3/12 (25%), and 2/12 (16.6%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG,
SARS-CoV-2 IgM, or both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, respectively; RT-PCR of the nasopharingeal swab resulted
positive in 5/12 (41.7%) (Table 3). No difference in positivity for IgG neutralizing antibodies was found between the
case (6/11, 54.5%) and the control group (5/12, 41.7%) (p=0.53) (Table 1). There was no statistically significant

difference between the two groups for average antibody titer, both non neutralizing (21.3 vs. 18.3 COI; p=0.42) and
neutralizing antibodies (39.9 vs 46.9 AU/ml; p=0.69).
Twelve of the COVID-19 patients reported previous symptoms (12/23, 52.2%) including fever (7/12, 58.3%), anosmia
and ageusia (5/12, 41.7%), cough (5/12, 41.7%), arthralgia (4/12, 33.3%), and diarrhea (1/12, 8.3%); no pneumonia or
Hospital admission due to COVID-19-related symptoms was recorded. No difference in the incidence of symptoms was
noted between the case (4/11, 36.4%) and the control group (8/12, 66.6%) (p=0.14).

Discussion
With this case-control study, we evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on first trimester spontaneous abortion in a cohort
of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by antibody testing or RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal
swabs. The results show that the risk of first trimester abortion is not impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection, also after
being adjusted for age. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the largest cohort of Coronaviruses infection during
early pregnancy published so far.
The course of COVID-19 varies widely: patients may remain asymptomatic or develop mild to severe symptoms
leading to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.12 The non-negligible prevalence of infection in asymptomatic
pregnant women reported elsewhere8,13 makes universal screening of all pregnant patients appear desirable. However,
because international guidelines diverge on this issue, it is difficult to determine the real impact that COVID-19 could
have on pregnancy, especially during the first weeks of gestation, which are usually managed with outpatient
monitoring; in some cases, abortion may be considered even before an obstetric exam has been made.
Serologic tests, in conjunction with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, may offer a more feasible opportunity to identify
both active and past infections and to evaluate the real spread of SARS-CoV-2, to the point that some governments have
suggested their use in large-scale population tracking.14 Determination of seroconversion in pregnant women could
answer some concerns about unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, which are not otherwise resolvable.
One of the strengths of the present study is the enrollment of women with serologically confirmed COVID-19 by means
of two different serological assays; the combined results of RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab samples is another major
strength of the study. The high adhesion rate to the study protocol limited confounding factors such as population
selection bias. Antibodies to COVID-19 were detected in about one out of ten pregnant patients in the cohort; this
finding should be carefully interpreted, however, as it cannot be generalized because derived from a single center
located in a region with a high incidence of COVID-19.
A major limitation of the study is that we were unable to accurately backdate the time of infection in women with
spontaneous abortion. In the absence of an IgG avidity test, we evaluated the time elapsed between the abortion and the
blood test for antibody detection. The profile of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort was comparable with
previous findings. Seroconversion of IgG or IgM within 20 days after symptom onset has recently been reported.15 The
median day of seroconversion for both IgG and IgM was 13 days with a synchronous or a discordant pattern. In light of
this evidence, seroconversion during pregnancy could be excluded (or be controversial) only in one patient (no. 4, Fig.
2) in the case group. The detection of IgM antibodies at 66 days after abortion does not preclude that seroconversion
might have occurred after the loss of pregnancy.
In view of future research addressing the issue on the relationship between COVID-19 and spontaneous abortion, it will
be difficult for researchers to precisely define the timing of infection and the effective seroconversion during pregnancy.
Inclusion criteria, together with the beginning of the study at pandemic outbreak, allowed us to fairly overcome this
issue.

Concern is mounting about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, possible vertical transmission,16–18 and unfavorable
obstetric outcomes in particular. Reproductive medicine societies advised delaying the start of assisted reproductive
treatments19 and guidelines on the prevention and control of COVID-19 among pregnant women have been issued.20–22
Currently, data on the impact of Coronaviruses on the first trimester of pregnancy are limited. Four of the seven patients
who presented with SARS-CoV-1 infection during their first trimester had a spontaneous abortion, likely the result of
the hypoxia caused by SARS-CoV-1-related acute respiratory distress.23 Furthermore, one case of a woman with MERS
during the first trimester has been reported. She was asymptomatic and went on to have a term delivery.24 As for SARSCoV-2, a single abortion during the second trimester of pregnancy in a woman with COVID-19 was probably related to
placental infection.25 Another study reported the first visualization by electron microscopy of the SARS-CoV-2
invading syncytiotrophoblasts in the placental villi.26 This evidence could suggest a potential impact of SARS-CoV-2
on spontaneous abortion. However, our study findings may reduce concerns in patients during the first trimester of
pregnancy. In the present cohort of women who experienced an abortion during the first trimester the serological
prevalence of antibodies was similar to that in the women with ongoing pregnancies. Furthermore, although viral
infection at this stage could potentially affect embryogenesis and organ development, there is still no evidence for the
intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite these reassuring data, pregnancies in women with COVID-19 can still have an unfavorable obstetric outcome:
inflammatory involvement of the placenta27 can be associated with preterm delivery.28 Moreover, physiologic maternal
adaptations to pregnancy predispose pregnant women to a more severe course of pneumonia, with subsequent higher
maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.29 In this cohort, however, few patients were symptomatic and not more
numerous in the case group. Severe disease was never observed. The lower incidence of severe manifestations during
the first trimester could be explained by the minimal alteration in respiratory dynamics during this phase of pregnancy.
In conclusion, our study provides reassuring findings for women who intend to become pregnant during the SARSCoV-2 pandemic or who became infected during their first trimester of pregnancy. COVID-19 appears to have a
favorable maternal course at the beginning of pregnancy, consistent with what has been observed during the third
trimester when the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-positive pregnant women were similar to those found in
women from the general population.30 More importantly, no significant difference in the early abortion rate was
observed. Long-term follow-up of ongoing pregnancies will respond to other doubts about the impact of COVID-19 in
pregnant patients.
