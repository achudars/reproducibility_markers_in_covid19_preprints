Abstract
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. High-flow nasal cannula
therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill patients, but information
regarding the timing of HFNC application is scarce, especially in elderly patients. We
retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 110 elderly patients (≥65 years) who received HFNC
from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, People's Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese
Medicine Hospital of Shishou City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of
Guangdong Medical University, People's Hospital of Yangjiang City, People's Hospital of
Maoming City in Guangdong Province, China.
Of the 110 patients, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 68-78) and 59.1% was male. Thirty-eight
patients received HFNC when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), and 72
patients received HFNC treatment when 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg (late HFNC
group). Compared with the late HFNC group, patients in the early HFNC group had a lower
likelihood of developing severe ARDS, longer time from illness onset to severe ARDS and
shorter duration of viral shedding after illness onset, as well as shorter lengths of ICU and
hospital stay. Twenty-four patients died during hospitalization, of whom 22 deaths (30.6%) were
in the late HFNC group and 2(5.3%) in the early HFNC group. It is concluded that the Prognosis
was better in severely ill elderly patients with COVID-19 receiving early compared to late HFNC.
This suggests HFNC could be considered early in this disease process.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, but has rapidly
spread worldwide.[1] Since initial detection of the virus, more than 2,626,000 cases of COVID19 have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 181,000 deaths as of April 24, 2020.
COVID-19 is more likely to affect elderly patients with comorbidities, and can result in severe or
fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).[2] Initial reports
from China[3], Italy[4] and the United States[5] suggested high mortality for elderly and
critically ill patients with COVID-19. No specific therapeutic agents or vaccines for COVID-19
are available, although several antiviral medications such as remdesivir and favipiravir are under
investigation. [6, 7]
Patients with severe illness may develop dyspnea and hypoxemia within one week after the onset
of COVID-19 and may quickly progress to ARDS,[2] a major cause of death in patients with
COVID-19.[8] Thus, respiratory support and intensive care management are vital to saving lives.
Reports showed that both conventional oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), such
as NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation), are commonly used in COVID-19
patients to improve oxygenation and reduce the possibility of intubation.[9, 10] However, the risk
of airborne transmission with NIPPV is a major concern, while that for high flow nasal cannula
therapy (HFNC) is judged minimal.[11] A guideline for the management of critically ill adults
with COVID-19 published in JAMA March 26, 2020 recommended the use of HFNC relative to
NIPPV in the circumstance of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional oxygen
therapy.[11] However, evidence is lacking regarding optimal timing to apply HFNC. In this study,
we report the clinical characteristics of elderly (≥65 years) patients with COVID-19 who
developed ARDS on or shortly after admission and compared outcomes of patients who started
HFNC at different stages of ARDS.

Methods
Study design and participants
This retrospective cohort study included elderly patients (≥ 65 years) from Renmin Hospital of
Wuhan University, People’s Hospital of Xiantao City and Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shishou
City in Hubei Province, China, and from Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University,
People’s Hospital of Yangjiang City, People’s Hospital of Maoming City in Guangdong Province,
China. All elderly patients who were diagnosed with severe COVID-19 according to WHO
interim guidance, and those who were treated with HFNC between January 14, 2020 (when the
first patients were admitted in these hospitals) and March 5, 2020, were included in the present
study. Due to the lack of understanding of this new disease, the timing of HFNC treatment was
uncertain. In this retrospective study, of 110 HFNC-treated patients, 38 received HFNC treatment
when 200 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg (early HFNC group), while 72 were first treated with
conventional oxygen therapies (e.g., low flow nasal catheter ventilation) and then HFNC when
100 mmHg < PO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg (late HFNC group). HFNC was started from low levels and
gradually titrated to 60 L/min for patients without obvious complaint of chest distress or
shortness of breath. However, for patients who were short of breath (e.g., respiratory
rate >30/min) the flow rates were commenced at 60 L/min. The goal of oxygen therapy was to
maintain the oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 93%-96%, which is in keeping with the recent
guideline recommendation of a reasonable SpO2 range of 92-96% for patients receiving
oxygen .[12]
This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of participating
institutes (PJ2020-005), and the informed consent was waived by the Medical Ethical Committee.

Data Collection
Patients’ medical records were reviewed and epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and
radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection
forms. Two research investigators (LD and SL) independently reviewed the data collection forms
to verify accuracy.
We collected data on age, sex, exposure history, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes,
malignancy, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic
kidney disease), chest CT images, signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, fatigue, dry cough, dyspnea),
time of first symptom to dyspnea, ARDS and ICU admission, vital signs (heart rate, respiratory
rate, blood pressure) and laboratory values (e.g., white blood cell count, neutrophil count,
lymphocyte count, procalcitonin concentration, arterial blood gas analysis, fraction of inspired
oxygen (FiO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and lactate concentration) on hospital
admission and disease progression, treatments (e.g., oxygen support, antiviral therapy, antibiotic
therapy, glucocorticoids, immunoglobulin), complications (e.g., septic shock, ARDS, secondary
infection), and discharge/death. The numbers of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, the
numbers of patients requiring FiO2 = 100%, > 80% and > 60% for more than 72 hours
continuously, length of ICU stay, and length of stay (LOS) were also collected.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included incidence of
severe ARDS, the numbers of ICU admission and patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The
ICU admission standard is patients require invasive mechanical ventilation, or have shock or
other organ failure that need ICU monitoring and treatment.[13, 14] ARDS was defined as acute

onset hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2: mild ARDS, > 200 to ≤ 300 mmHg; moderate ARDS, >100 to

≤200 mmHg; severe ARDS, ≤100 mmHg) with bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest imaging
not fully explained by other disease according to the Berlin definition.[15] Secondary infection
was defined when patients showed clinical symptoms or signs of bacteremia and a positive
culture of a new pathogen obtained from sputum or blood samples after admission.[13] Acute
cardiac injury was identified when the hypersensitive troponin I and creatine kinase–MB were
above the 99% upper reference limit or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography
and echocardiography.[13] Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to KDIGO
criteria.[16]
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as mean with standard deviation (SD) when normally
distributed and compared by independent sample t test, or expressed as median with interquartile
range (IQR) if non-normally distributed and compared by Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical
variables were expressed as n (%) and compared by Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test
between early HFNC and late HFNC groups. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS (version 25)
software.
Results
A total of 638 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted
to participating hospitals during the defined study time period. Of these, 502 patients who did not
receive HFNC treatment were excluded, as were 19 patients due to missing key information in
their medical records, and 7 patients who had cardiac arrest within 24 hours after admission.

Thus, a total of 110 patients were included in our study. Of these 110 patients, 38 patients
received early HFNC treatment, and 72 patients received late HFNC treatment.
The median age of the 110 patients was 71 (IQR 68-78; range 65 to 89) years, and most
(65[59.1%)]) were male (Table 1). Eighty-seven (79.1%) patients had underlying comorbidities,
1.3 comorbidities per patient on average. The most common comorbidities were hypertension
(57 [51.8%]), cardiovascular disease (27 [24.5%]), chronic pulmonary disease (22 [20%]) and
diabetes (20 [18.2%]). The most common symptoms on admission were fever (105 [95.5%]),
cough (65 [59.1%]), weakness (23 [20.9%]), and sputum production (22 [20%]) Table 1). The
most common abnormal laboratory findings were lymphocytopenia, increased C-reactive protein,
and decreased CD3, CD4 and CD8 counts on hospital admission (Table 1). The overall median
SPO2 was 95% (IQR 93-98%) on admission, and the median ratio of PaO2/FiO2 was 238 mmHg
(IQR 221-277). There were no significant differences in admission SPO2 or PaO2/FiO2 between
early and late HFNC groups. Both SpO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio at initiation of HFNC were higher
and the time from admission to HFNC treatment was shorter in the early HFNC group (Table 1).
All patients showed bilateral lung involvement on chest CT scan at admission, including
consolidation, ground-glass opacity, interstitial lesions, and exudative lesions (figure 1). Patients
who received early HFNC had a lower likelihood of developing severe pneumonia, manifested as
more than 50% increase in pneumonitis foci on chest CT scan during disease progression (Table
2).
All patients received antiviral medications (lopinavir or ritonavir), and 66 (60%) patients also
received antibiotics. Thirty-eight (34.5%) patients required prone ventilation, 24 (21.8%)
received non-invasive ventilation, and 42 (38.2%) patients required invasive mechanical

ventilation, of whom 7 received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as rescue therapy.
Common complications among the 110 patients included secondary infection (51 [46.3%]),
severe ARDS (42 [38.2%]), septic shock (18 [16.4%]), acute cardiovascular injury (13 [11.8%]),
AKI (6 [5.4%]), and cardiac arrest (3 [2.7%]) (table 2). The patients who received early HFNC
were less likely to have secondary infection or severe ARDS, and less likely to receive prone
position ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation than the patients who receive late HFNC.
Major laboratory markers and SOFA score were tracked from hospital admission (figure 2).
Lymphocyte count was higher in patients who received early HFNC during hospitalization.
Lactate dehydrogenase level did not differ between these two groups on day 3 after admission,
but continued to increase in the late HFNC group and was significantly higher on day 9 after
admission and onwards. Both the levels of D-dimer and C-reactive protein were significantly
lower throughout the clinical course in patients who received early HFNC. Lactate concentration
and SOFA score were similar between groups on day 3 after admission. Patients who received
early HFNC showed lower lactate concentration on day 15 and lower SOFA score on day 9 after
admission and onwards (figure 2).
Of the 110 patients who received HFNC, 40 (36.4%) patients required more than 60% FiO2,
23 (22.7%) patients required FiO2 more than 80%, and 4 (3.6%) patients required 100% FiO2
(table 1). All 22 patients in the late HFNC group who died during hospitalization received FiO2 >
60% for more than 72 hours continuously (table 3). The numbers of patients who required higher
than 60% FiO2 and those who required more than 80% FiO2 were smaller in the early HFNC
group. FiO2 and PO2/FiO2 were tracked during hospitalization. As shown in figure 3, baseline
FiO2 and PaO2/FiO2 were similar between the two groups. The patients in the early HFNC group

showed higher ratio of PaO2/FiO2 on day 3 after admission, and required lower FiO2 on day 6
after admission and onwards.
The median time from illness onset to ICU admission was 11 days (IQR 8-14), and 12 days
(IQR 11-15) to severe ARDS. The length of ICU stay was 17 days (IQR 12-22), LOS was 27
days (IQR 16-32), and duration of viral shedding after illness onset was 16 days (IQR 13-21).
Patients who received early HFNC were less likely to admit to ICU, less likely to stay in ICU
longer than 7 days, had less chance to develop severe ARDS and had longer time from COVID19 onset to severe ARDS (if any). Duration of viral shedding after illness onset and length of
ICU and hospital stay were shorter in the early HFNC group. A total of 86 (78.2%) patients had
been discharged, and 24 (21.8%) patients had died. The mortality in late HFNC group was higher
than that in early HFNC (22 [30.6%] vs. 2 [5.3%]) as shown in Table 2 and Figure 3C.
Discussion
This report, presents the outcomes of 110 severely ill elderly COVID-19 patients who received
oxygen therapy with HFNC. Mortality was lower (5.3%) in 38 patients who received HNFC
treatment at the mild ARDS stage, compared to 30.6% in 72 patients in whom HNFC treatment
was started at the moderate ARDS stage. The mortality rate in this study was lower than that
reported from a multi-national study regarding the mortality for patients with ARDS, which was
34.9% and 40.3% respectively for those with mild or moderate ARDS.[17] An early report from
China[3] and a recent report from the United States[5] reported 61.5% and 50% mortalities
respectively for critically ill patients with COVID-19, while the mortality for critically ill
patients aged 60 years or older was as high as 70.3%.[3]
HFNC, as an innovative and effective modality for oxygen therapy, delivers titratable oxygen

up to 60 liters/minutes with heating and humidification to produce a low-level positive endexpiratory pressure and to achieve FiO2 as high as 95-100%.[9] HFNC has been shown to reduce
the risk of requiring more advanced ventilation and relieve dyspnea better than conventional
oxygen therapy and has been suggested as a first-line therapy even before making a clear
diagnosis for dyspnea.[10] In our study, 10.5% patients in the early HFNC group converted to
invasive mechanic ventilation, which is in contrast to the 52.7% in the late HFNC group (Table
2). These findings can be compared to other published reports. A cohort study in 17 COVID-19
patients indicated starting HFNC when PaO2/FiO2>200 reduced the need of mechanical
ventilation, although the impact on mortality was not reported.[18] Starting HFNC or invasive
mechanical ventilation at a relatively late stage of disease severity such as moderate to severe
ARDS may prompt the physician to apply high FiO2. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 in the
Seattle region[5] had reported 50% mortality at the time of data cut off with several patients
continuing to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. In the study,[5] the initial median FiO2
on day 1 of mechanical ventilation was 90% (IQR 70-100%), and the FiO2 decreased to 60%
(IQR 50-70%) on day 3 but no further information was provided about FiO2 afterwards. It is
possible that the FiO2 had to be readjusted to higher levels due to the subsequent difficulty in
reaching targeted PaO2 and/or PaO2/FiO2. High oxygen mediated oxidative lung damage[19] may
further exacerbate oxygenation, which may paradoxically push for the need of higher FiO2. In
addition, oxidative stress during respiratory viral infection may also exacerbate a “cytokine
storm”.[20] In the late HFNC group, the required FiO2 increase over time we found (Figure 3)
was coincident with progressive increases of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (Figure 2),
indicators of inflammation that could be related to a relatively higher mortality rate in the late
HFNC group.

Evidence shows that liberal oxygen therapy increases mortality without improving other
outcomes and that supplemental oxygen might become unfavorable above a SpO2 range of 9496%.[21] A multicenter study of critically ill patients with the Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) related to MERS-CoV infection showed that non-survivors received
significantly higher FiO2 than survivors on ICU day 1.[22] Thus, despite the generally accepted
normal range of PaO2 80 - 100 mmHg breathing room air at sea level in healthy young adults, we
took into consideration the relatively lower reference values for PaO2 in the elderly compared to
young adults as well as gender differences.[23, 24] Previous studies showed that in elders over 70
years old the normal PaO2 for men was 77 mmHg (SD. 9.1; and lower limit of normal at
62mmHg), while PaO2 for women was 73.5 mmHg (SD. 8.4; lower limit of normal at
59.6mmHg), [23]and normal reference values reduce with age.[24] In practice, we estimated the
acceptable normal values of PaO2 using the formula: normal PaO2 at sea level (in mmHg) = 100
minus the number of years over ago 40, as proposed.[25] For SpO2, we recommended 93% for
men and 92% for women as the lower limit of normal.We also recommended SpO2 95% or 96%
as the highest target value, which is generally in keeping with the recommendation by Chinese
CDC and the recently published guideline recommending of no higher than 96%.[26] However,
accuracy of SpO2 readings may be affected by factors such as low perfusion and the use of
vasodilator,[27] so target values of SpO2 were set at the discretion of treating physician, and
arterial blood gas analysis was used to adjust treatments (e.g., FiO2 and/or flow rate).
In our study, FiO2 values were maintained significantly lower in the early HFNC group
(Figure 2). Post-hoc subgroup analysis in the late HFNC group revealed that FiO2 of survivors
was significantly lower than that of the non-survivors (table 3), and initial targeted SpO2 was
also relatively higher in the non-survivor subgroup (data not shown). In the current study, all the

baseline characteristics and laboratory values were comparable between early and late HFNC
groups.
There is evidence to show that airborne transmission with HFNC is minimal[11, 28] and that
risk of hospital-acquired infection did not increase with the use of HFNC provided there is good
mask fitting.[29] However, the safety of HFNV in these patients is controversial given SARSCoV-2 virus is highly contagious.[30] Because of risks, all staff in ward or ICU care settings are
strongly recommended/required to wear a disposable surgical cap, medical protective mask
(N95), disposable medical protective uniform and disposable gloves with full-face respiratory
protective devices when performing procedures like tracheal intubation.[31]
In conclusion, the application of HFNC in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) with COVID-19,
especially when used with conservative oxygen delivery, may prove to be a promising treatment
modality for critically ill patients with acute ARDS in general, and of critically ill elderly
COVID-19 patients in particular, although larger scale prospective studies are needed to confirm
its effectiveness. Our current study provides evidence that application of HFNC earlier during
the mild stage of ARDS may be associated with reduced need for mechanic ventilation and
mortality in critically ill elderly patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The fact that early
application of HFNC was associated with shorter time duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding
may be of significance in reducing transmission.
Clinical Perspectives
• High-flow nasal cannula therapy (HFNC) is a major oxygen supporting therapy for severely ill
patients, and is recommended for use in COVID-19 patients.

However, study is lacking

regarding the optimal timing of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) application among critically ill

elderly COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that early application of HFNC for oxygen
delivery in severely ill COVID-19 patients may facilitate patient recovery and reduce mortality.
• In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study involving 110 elderly patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, prognosis was much better in 38 patients who received HFNC when 200
mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg, compared to 72 patients who received HFNC treatment
when their 100 mmHg< PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg. Early application of HFNC was associated
shorter lengths of ICU and hospital stay and reduced mortality.
• HFNC should be considered early in treating elderly patients with COVID-19.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Representative chest computed tomographic images of elderly patients with
COVID-19 who received early or late High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC).
A-D: a 72 year old man with COVID-19 received early HFNC therapy when his PaO2/FiO2 was
256 mmHg. (A) Image obtained on day 1 showed small ground-glass opacity lesion (red arrow)
in the middle lobe of the right lung; (B) image obtained on day 5 showed enlarged lesion in right
lung and several small areas of new exudative lesions in outer basal segment of lower lobe of left
lung; (C) image obtained on day 18 showed the lesion in the middle lobe of the right lung
reduced more than 50%, and clear interstitial lesions were found in the lower lobes of both lungs;
(D) image obtained day 24 showed the lesions were further reduced and became lighter in
density (red arrow). HFNC was discontinued on day 23, and this patient was discharged on Day
26.
E-F: a 68 year old man with COVID-19 received late HFNC oxygen therapy when his
PaO2/FiO2 was 186 mmHg. (E) Image obtained on day 1 showed a few patchy exudative lesions
and cord like fibrosis in bilateral lobes of both lungs (red arrow); (F) image obtained on day 7
showed original lesions were obviously increased, and parenchymal lesions (such as
consolidation and air bronchogram) in the middle and lower lobes of right lung, as well as
appearance of interstitial lesions in lower left lung; (G) image obtained on day 21 showed
increased patchy exudative lesions and interstitial lesions with light density (a few reticular lung
changes) in lower left lung; (F) image obtained on day 33 showed a few grid lung changes and
subpleural lines in the right lower lobe. This patient required invasive mechanical ventilation on
day 23, and died of cardiac arrest on day 36 after admission.
