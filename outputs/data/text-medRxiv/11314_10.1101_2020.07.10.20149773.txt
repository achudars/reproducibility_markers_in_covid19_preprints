Abstract

22

On April 25th, corresponding to the first deconfinement phase after the end of the

23

lockdown in Switzerland, a universal admission screening strategy for COVID-19 was

24

introduced in our hospital. All patients, including asymptomatic patients were tested for

25

SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In

26

addition to a qualitative answer, providing viral load values to the RT-PCR results not only

27

helped the clinician to evaluate the stage of the infection but addressed patient

28

contagiousness and guided infection control decisions. Here, we discuss the importance

29

of reporting viral load values when a shift from a symptomatic to a universal screening

30

strategy was performed.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 quantitative reverse

38

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a crucial diagnostic tool

39

for patient care, hospital hygiene decisions and health authorities policy (1). In addition to

40

qualitative “yes or no” answer, RT-PCR can provide quantitative values based on cycle

41

threshold values (Cts) and their corresponding calculated viral loads. However, several

42

studies have reported i) that viral loads may vary significantly among patients, clinical

43

specimens and during the infection (Jacot et al., submitted) and ii) that RT-PCRs could

44

remain positive up to five weeks after onset of symptoms (2). Between the beginning of

45

March and May 17th, our molecular diagnostic laboratory located in a tertiary care

46

university hospital (Lausanne, Switzerland), performed more than 34’000 SARS-CoV-2

47

RT-PCRs using three different platforms: our high throughput automated molecular

48

diagnostic platform (MDx platform) (3), the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test and the GeneXpert

49

Xpress SARS-CoV-2. All three platforms showed comparable performance with correlation

50

of the Cts values (Jacot et al., submitted and Opota et al., submitted).

51

Reporting Ct values can be beneficial for the interpretation of RT-PCR results (4).

52

Such information can be used i) by the laboratory as an internal quality assessment tool,

53

ii) by clinicians to evaluate the progression of the infection (especially in lower respiratory

54

tract specimens) or iii) to address patient contagiousness and hence to guide infection

55

control decisions. Regarding the latter application, the benefit of reporting the Ct value

56

appeared of utmost importance when a universal admission or pre-intervention screening

57

strategy including asymptomatic patients was introduced in our hospital from April 25th, as

58

supported by the analysis of 32’005 RT-PCR results obtained in our laboratory. Overall,

59

we observed higher Ct values (lower viral loads) in patients screened after April 25th than

60

for patients, mostly symptomatic, screened during the “epidemic period” (Fig. 1). This

61

abrupt change was confirmed by looking only at a 2 weeks period just prior to the

62

universal screening. The GeneXpert SARS-CoV-2 test was broadly used during this

63

period, detecting the SARS-CoV-2-specific N2 region (encoding for viral nucleoprotein N2)

64

and the E-gene (encoding for a protein of the envelope, Cts for the E-gene were used as

65

they correlated with the other two platforms). Among the very high Cts, we obtained

66

several results positive only for N2 suggesting a very low viral load at the detection limit of

67

the GeneXpert assay (5, 6). By retesting these specimens with other RT-PCR platforms

68

and reviewing clinical data, we could demonstrate that these N2 only positive results

69

corresponded to true detection of viral RNA. This reinsured us on the specificity of the test

70

when the percentage of positive results dramatically decreased due to the reduced virus

71

circulation and to the strategy of universal screening, including asymptomatic patients.

72

Since April 25th, we reported the viral load for all the SARS-CoV-2 PCR with a lower

73

threshold of 1’000cp/ml as “positive result <1’000cp/ml” (Ct >37). When only the N2 gene

74

was positive, the reported result was “very low positive with impossible quantification” as

75

viral load quantification was performed on the E gene.

76

In addition to clinical data, providing quantitative viral loads values can help

77

epidemiologists for infection control strategy. According to the Centers for Disease Control

78

and Prevention, transmission-based precautions might be reconsidered either when 10

79

days have passed since symptoms first appeared or following at least two consecutive

80

negative RT-PCR results (7). However, even with the complete resolution of symptoms,

81

some patients can have a prolonged positive test result (2). We observed patients’

82

specimens positive results although with very high Cts, up to 5 weeks after infection. This

83

might correspond to nonviable virus and/or to patients with very low transmission potential.

84

While many pre-analytical issues can affect the result of any respiratory virus RT-PCRs,

85

our data also highlight the importance of viral load quantification for the interpretation of

86

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs for the care of patients with positive results, especially at the end

87

of viral disease.

Figure 1: Median viral load value of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR compared across
two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Median viral load value of positive SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR was compared across two periods: the “epidemic period” (left), during which
mainly symptomatic patients were screened, and the “post-epidemic period” (right) when
all patients were tested on hospital admission. A sharp decrease of median viral load
(often <1’000 cp/ml ) values was observed during the universal screening period when
most subjects tested were asymptomatic. Patient samples analyzed using the GeneXpert
test and showing only an N positive PCR are displayed below the quantification limit. Cts
were converted to viral loads using the formula -0.27Ct+13.04 generated using purified
viral RNA, kindly provided by the Institute of Virology of the University of Berlin, la Charité
(8). Significance of viral load decrease was assessed using a parametric paired t-test with
p-values ≤ 0.0001. m= Ct value median, n= number of positive samples, n tot= total
number of tests, pos= percentage of positive tests.
