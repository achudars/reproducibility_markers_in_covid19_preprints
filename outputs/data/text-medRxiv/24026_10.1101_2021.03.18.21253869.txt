Abstract
Objectives: It has recently been shown that von Willebrand factor (vWf) multimers may be a key
driver of immunothrombosis in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since COVID-19 is associated
with an increased risk of autoreactivity, the present study investigates, whether the generation of
autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 contributes to this finding.
controlled multicenter study.

Design: Observational prospective

Setting: Blood samples and clinical data of patients with COVID-19

were collected regularly during hospitalization in the period from April to November 2020. Patients:
90 patients with confirmed COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 30 healthy controls participated
in this study.

Measuerements and Main Results: Antibodies to ADAMTS13 occurred in 31 (34.4%)

patients with COVID-19. Generation of ADAMTS13 antibodies was associated with a significantly
lower ADAMTS13 activity (56.5%, interquartile range (IQR) 21.25 vs. 71.5%, IQR 24.25, p=0.0041),
increased disease severity (severe or critical disease in 90% vs. 62.3%, p=0.0189), and a trend to a
higher mortality (35.5% vs. 18.6%, p=0.0773). Median time to antibody development was 11 days
after first positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR specimen.

Conclusion: The present study demonstrates for the

first time, that generation of antibodies to ADAMTS13 is a frequent finding in COVID-19. Generation
of these antibodies is associated with a lower ADAMTS13 activity and an increased risk of an adverse
course of the disease suggesting an inhibitory effect on the protease. These findings provide a
rationale to include ADAMTS13 antibodies in the diagnostic workup of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

In

concentration of ≥16 U/mL is considered positive and diagnostic for TTP. Noteworthy, none

of the patients developed severe thrombopenia < 50.000/µl. Thus, the inhibitory effect is

likely to be weaker than in TTP.

The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an increased risk of autoreactivity.

Hence,

have

been

during

pandemic.[5, 6] Recently, lupus- and rheumatoid arthritis-like antibody patterns have been

was

(35,6%)

to

the

proportion

of

subjects

developing

ADAMTS13

antibodies in the present study (34.4%). SARS-CoV-2 thereby increases the risk of thrombotic

microangiopathy by two synergistic mechanisms: First, the ubiquitous endothelial damage

induced

an excessive release of vWf, which might even exceed the

protease activity

of

physiological concentrations of ADAMTS13. Second, the SARS-CoV-2 induced autoreactive

inflammatory milieu leads to the generation of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13, which reduces

ADAMTS13

activity

and

thereby

further

impairs

the

protease’s

capacity.

Both

of

mechanisms yield an increased risk of intravascular large and ultralarge vWf multimers with
