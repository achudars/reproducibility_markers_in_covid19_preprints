Abstract

27

Background:

28

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has driven many countries to take radical suppression

29

measures. While reducing mortality, these measures result in severe economic repercussions,

30

and inhibit the development of herd immunity. Until an effective vaccine will be available,

31

we propose an alternative approach, akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which

32

intentionally triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its

33

main goal is to approach herd immunity faster than the current alternatives, with lower

34

mortality rates and lower demand for critical health-care resources. According to this

35

approach, individuals whose probability of developing serious health conditions is low (i.e.

36

20-49 years old with no comorbidities) will be offered the option to be voluntarily exposed to

37

the virus under controlled supervision, and will then be issued 'immunity certificates' if they

38

are confirmed to have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

39

Methods:

40

Using a compartmental model we examine the implications of the controlled avalanche (CA)

41

strategy over the population in Israel. We compare four scenarios: in two scenarios the CA

42

program is applied to the low-risk population (with the rest of the population subject to

43

mitigation measures), followed by mitigation for the entire population or by uncontrolled

44

spread. These are compared to mitigated and uncontrolled scenarios without the CA program.

45

We discuss the economic, ethical and public health implications of the CA strategy.

46

Findings:

47

We show that compared to mitigation of the entire population, the CA strategy reduces the

48

overall mortality by 43%, reduces the maximum number of people in need for ICUs by 62%

49

and decreases the time required for release of 50% of the low-risk population by more than 2

50

months.

51

Interpretation:

52

This study suggests an ethically acceptable practice, that enables reaching herd immunity

53

faster than the current alternatives, with low mortality and minimal economic damage.

Introduction

58

The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has created a crisis where optimal control and means of

59

mitigation are still unknown. Two main competing strategies have been suggested and

60

implemented for controlling the epidemic: The first, suppression, aims at drastic reduction of

61

disease incidence. This strategy is based on radical social distancing, closure of schools and

62

universities and forbidding mass gatherings. Policies reflecting this strategy were first

63

enacted by the Chinese government and, subsequently, by other countries. The second

64

strategy, mitigation, is based on case isolation, voluntary home quarantine, and social

65

distancing of high-risk populations. This strategy was successfully implemented in Israel

66

during the first three weeks of the epidemic. However, it was abandoned and replaced by a

67

suppression strategy due to a sharp increase of disease incidence following a holiday (1).

68

Mitigation strategy was also practiced for a short time in England before being abandoned

69

after Ferguson et al. demonstrated their projections (2) and it is currently practiced in

70

Sweden.

71

Ferguson et al., (2) demonstrated that although mitigation would reduce peak critical health

72

care demand, it would still be several times higher than its surge capacity. Consequently, it

73

would result in a staggering death toll. These grim forecasts were realized in the epidemics in

74

Italy, Spain, France and the US, which shifted to suppression only during late stages of the

75

epidemic. Suppression, on the other hand, though effective in controlling the epidemic, would

76

prevent the development of herd immunity and is expected to paralyze the economy and

77

carries far-reaching social ramifications.

78

Some countries (e.g. Taiwan, South-Korea and Singapore) have followed WHO

79

recommendations (3), and implemented social distancing with contact tracing accompanied

80

by massive testing and isolation of the infected prior to symptoms. These countries have been

81

relatively successful in mitigating the epidemic and reducing case fatality so far (4) , though

82

none of them has eliminated the virus.

83

Covid-19 is characterized by a high R0, probable infectiousness of asymptomatic and pre-

84

clinical patients (5), and has no known cure, precluding containment (6). Therefore, in the

85

absence of effective vaccine, the only foreseeable endpoint of this epidemic can be expected

86

when a certain level of herd immunity is reached. Such a condition requires a large

87

proportion of the population (58%-70%) to be infected, depending on the estimated R0 (2.4-

88

3.3) (2, 7).

The main goal of any control strategy should be therefore to reduce the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

89

percentage of high-risk population among those infected until herd immunity is reached, and

90

use critical health care resources optimally over time.

91

The strategy we propose is based on identifiable risk characteristics of different segments in

92

the population and on voluntary immunization through exposure. Instead of using non-

93

discriminating measures targeted at the population as a whole, we propose regulated

94

voluntary exposure of its low-risk members. Once they are certified as immune, these

95

individuals return to the population, increase its overall immunity and resume their normal

96

life. This approach is akin to avalanche control at ski resorts, a practice which intentionally

97

triggers small avalanches in order to prevent a singular catastrophic one. Its main goal is to

98

create herd immunity, faster than current alternatives, and with lower mortality rates and

99

lower demand for critical health-care resources. Furthermore, it is also expected to be

100

effective in relieving the huge economic pressures created by the current pandemic (For

101

similar proposals see supplementary material).

102

Using a compartmental model of the SEIRD framework we examine three main effects of the

103

proposed strategy: total mortality, impact on the ICU at the peak of the epidemic and time of

104

return to work. We show that all three variables are significantly reduced by the proposed

105

strategy. We then discuss the economic, ethical and distributional aspects of its

106

implementation. We conclude that in the current situation, this approach is reasonable on all

107

grounds and that its underlying premises should be further examined to allow its

108

implementation.

Materials and methods

111

1. The Proposed Approach: Regulated Voluntary Exposure Based on Risk Characteristics

112

A. Underlying modelling assumptions

113

The proposed strategy dynamics was modeled, based on three assumptions:

114

The first assumption is that people infected by SARS-CoV-2 become immunized to future re-

115

infection for a long time period. Previous studies demonstrated a sustained neutralizing

116

antibody activity, lasting for at least two years, after the onset of symptoms in most of SARS-

117

Cov-1 recovered patients (8, 9) and persistence of anti-SARS-Cov-1 IgG in infected health-

118

care workers for at least 12 years (10). In a recent study researchers failed to re-infect

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

119

Macaque monkeys 28 days after first clinical infection, indicating protective immunity

120

developed after infection by SARS-Cov-2(11).

121

The second assumption, based on experience with SARS-Cov-2 is that the period of

122

infectiousness is limited and that virus shedding can be easily detected. Data collected so far

123

suggest that virus shedding by moderately affected Covid-19 patients does not exceed 14

124

days after onset of clinical signs (12, 13). Virus shedding was documented in asymptomatic

125

patients for at least seven days (14). Though there is no documentation of the longest period

126

of virus shedding in asymptomatic patients it is very reasonable to conclude that they do not

127

shed the virus longer than cases who show clinical signs. In accordance with this evidence,

128

the current guidelines of the ECDC and other health agencies for hospital discharge are based

129

on resolution of clinical signs (i.e. no fever for at least 3 days and significant improvement of

130

respiratory symptoms combined with at least two negative consecutive respiratory tract

131

samples taken at least 24 hours apart (14)).

132

The third assumption is that case fatality among people aged 20-49 years is very low.

133

According to Verity et al. the proportions of cases hospitalized among patients aged 20-29,

134

30-39 and 40-49 in China were 1%, 3.4% and 4.3%, respectively. Case fatality ratios (CFR)

135

estimated for these ages in Wuhan were 0.03%, 0.08% and 0.16% respectively (15). Similar

136

age specific CFRs were reported in South-Korea. Though Verity et al. did account for age

137

differential under-ascertainment and the Korean data is based on very meticulous

138

surveillance, the real extent of under-ascertainment may be lower and can be estimated only

139

after availability serologic data. It should also be considered that these case fatalities include

140

patients with co-morbidities even in the younger ages.

141

B. Regulated voluntary exposure program

142

Given the above three assumptions, the following program is suggested: Individuals whose

143

probability of developing serious health conditions is low will be offered the option to be

144

exposed to the virus under controlled supervision. To do so, a threshold risk factor should be

145

determined, based on easily identifiable and verifiable characteristics, most significantly age,

146

but also the existence of other comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiac disease, lung

147

disease, diabetes, etc.. Individuals whose risk is lower than this threshold would be allowed to

148

participate in the voluntary exposure program.

149

Exposure may be applied using one of various alternative measures – either through

150

individual controlled infection, or (as modelled here) through coordinated group exposure to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

151

the virus and quarantine, where all participants can communicate and contract the virus, thus

152

raising the effective reproductive number within this group. It may also be implemented by

153

simply relaxing social distancing and other limitations for the participants, subject to

154

subsequent quarantine and periodical medical monitoring.

155

The state would issue 'immunity certificates' to everyone who is confirmed to have developed

156

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and is verified as non-contagious (16) (development and validation

157

of good serological assays to detect exposure to the virus is currently defined as a major need

158

(4) and its wide implementation is a matter of short time). Certified individuals would be

159

allowed to reenter society and the workforce, as they can no-longer infect other people. They

160

may also provide medical treatment, as well as other necessary services to high-risk

161

population. These certified individuals would resume their social and economic life, and

162

contribute to the recovery of the economy on both supply and demand sides.

163

2. Modeling the epidemiological impact:

164

The dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic spread as well as the effect of the controlled

165

avalanche (CA) program were ascertained using a deterministic compartmental model which

166

is an expansion of an earlier model (1). Similar to other models that describe the dynamics of

167

COVID-19 in a given population, it describes the stages of the epidemic in a SEIRD

168

framework (17-19). In this framework, the modeled population is divided into five

169

compartments: S – susceptible, E – exposed and asymptomatic, I – infectious and

170

symptomatic, R – recovered and immune, and D – deceased. As there is evidence for the

171

possibility of infection by asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (5) the model consists the

172

possibility that a fraction ߝா of the individuals in the E compartment can be infectious.

173

Due to the fact that the risk of mortality due to COVID-19 is associated with age (15), the

174

model divides the population into two sub-populations: the low-risk labor age population that

175

consists of individuals whose age is in the range of 20-49 and the general population which

176

consists of all other individuals (top and middle SEIRD chains in Fig. 1, correspondingly).

177

The low-risk and general population lead to separate dynamics. However, these two sub-

178

populations are connected by the same group of infectious individuals, TI, which consists of

179

all members of the infectious and symptomatic compartments in the general and low-risk

180

population (namely, I and IL in Fig. 1) as well as a fraction ߝா of the asymptomatic members

181

of the two populations (namely, E and EL in Fig. 1). Therefore, the susceptible individuals in

182

each of the sub-populations (namely, S and SL) can be infected by any infectious individual

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.12.20062687; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

183

from either sub-population. The disease transmission (i.e., the passage from the S to E and SL

184

to EL) depends also on the effective contact rate, ߚ.

185

Following the infection, the passage of asymptomatic cases to symptomatic (i.e., from the E

186

to I and from the EL to IL compartments) is dictated by the rate of development of clinical

187

symptoms. From there, symptomatic and infectious individuals can either recover or die from

188

the disease, according to the CFR of the general population or that of the low-risk population,

189

ߜ and ߜ௅ , correspondingly. The passage between the I to the D or R (or from IL to DL and RL)

190

compartments is dictated by the recovery rate, ߛ .

191

In the model the CA program is implemented by allowing volunteers to stay with other

192

infected individuals at the same residency (e.g. hotels designated for the CA program), in

193

which no social distancing is implemented and high contact rate is allowed. When the CA

194

program is activated (low SEI chain in Fig. 1), a batch process begins. The function ߭ሺ‫ ݐ‬ሻ is a

195

forcing function that every ߬ days returns a value of 1, thus allowing a new batch (whose size

196

is NA) of low-risk susceptible volunteers to join the CA program. In the CA program, the

197

infection of susceptible volunteers, SA, is dictated by TA, the group of infectious individuals

198

among the CA program volunteers and ߚ஺ , the effective contact rate in the program. Upon

199

recovery or death, the volunteers return to the RL and DL compartments of their original

200

population.

201

In this study, the parameters that describe the epidemiology of the COVID-19 disease,

202

namely ߢ and ߛ , were based on an analysis of actual event-data (20). The infection fatality

203

ratios, ߜ and ߜ௅ , were based on weighted average of data on Israel’s population by age groups

204

with age dependent COVID-19 CFRs (15, 21). The periodic batch size of the CA program

205

volunteers was determined by associated data on the inventory of active tourist hotel rooms in

206

Israel (22). The effective contact rates, ߚ and ߚ஺ were set according to parameters estimated

207

for data from the COVID-19 outbreak in China, before and during control measures were

208

taken (23, 24). Further details on the model and its parameters are provided in the

209

supplementary part.

210

The dynamics of epidemic spread was modeled considering two distinct populations: low-

211

risk (ages of 20 to 49) and the rest of the population, termed here the general population (ages

212

0-19 and 50-). The following four scenarios were simulated:

213

1.

Uncontrolled epidemic spread for the entire population.

Results

221

In the modeled AC scenarios, the program was active during 210 days. During this time, the

222

simulation included an AC participation ratio of 81.5% from the low-risk population. As

223

depicted in Table 1, implementation of the CA policy leads to a dramatic reduction in

224

mortality, which is accompanied by a significantly faster release of the labor population. In

225

all scenarios, the main source of mortality is the general population. Fig. 2 demonstrates that

226

the CA policy is fastest in releasing the lower risk - labor population, and it results in the

227

lowest infection rate among the higher risk - general population.

228

A crucial number in public health management is the number of the intensive care units

229

(ICUs) available. A major challenge is to stay below this limit, which is currently in Israel

230

2,864 ICUs (25). Fig. 3 shows the ICU hospitalization demand for the four scenarios stated

231

above, where the current limit of ICUs in Israel is marked by horizontal grey dashed line. The

232

two scenarios which include CA implementation exhibit dramatically lower cases in need of

233

ICU hospitalizations. Furthermore, the maxima for the general population in need for ICUs

234

under both CA scenarios is 4,146 cases (and 570 for the low risk population), much lower

235

than the 11,839 and 35,382 cases for mitigation and uncontrolled scenarios, respectively

236

(Table 1).

237

Although in all scenarios the number of ICU hospitalizations for the total population exceeds

238

the ICU limit in Israel, the magnitude of the surge is dramatically reduced when the CA

239

strategy is implemented. Notably, in all scenarios, the general population is the main source

240

for the ICU demand while the CA volunteers require only very low percentage of the ICU

241

maximal capacity. It should also be pointed out that the analysis is based on the median

242

effective contact rate over 29 provinces, which implemented moderate lockdown in China

243

during early stages of the epidemic (23). More effective lockdown measures as implemented

244

later in China should lead to lower estimates of morbidity and mortality.

Discussion

248

In this current reality created by the ongoing Covid-19 epidemic, it is imperative to explore

249

different new control strategies and to rationally evaluate their costs, risks and benefits

250

compared to existing strategies. The proposed CA strategy is not intended to substitute

251

suppression measures, which are extremely important for epidemic containment and

252

prevention of overwhelming available ICU units (26); its efficient implementation is in

253

conjunction with such measures, as early as possible during the initial phase of the epidemic,

254

or as an exit strategy after the initial epidemic has been contained.

255

Our analysis shows that implementation of the CA strategy is expected to significantly reduce

256

the consequent death toll, to prevent overload of the ICU units through faster formation of

257

overall herd immunity in the population, and to significantly reduce the time period of

258

economic paralysis. The age dependent CFR used in this study does not separate sub-

259

populations with comorbidities. It can be expected that exclusion from the AC program of

260

people that are on the eligible age but suffer from comorbidities, may result in much lower

261

mortality among the volunteers. Furthermore, as the model demonstrates, the main strategy

262

for preventing overload of the ICU, is to increase suppression measures on the general

263

population, and not to limit the CA capacity, whose share of demand for ICU is low.

264

Implementation of the CA policy is thus the safest among all the possible options.

265

Since implementation depends on voluntary exposure, behavioral, ethical and political

266

considerations should also be considered. As we discuss in detail in the supplementary part,

267

each individual's decision whether to join the CA program depends on his risk exposure and

268

his individual earning and utility producing opportunities. An individual is more likely to join

269

the program the lower his expected fatality rate from the virus, the higher his probability of

270

contracting the virus if he does not join the program, the higher his benefit from resuming

271

normal life, and the longer he expects the social and economic closure to remain in place.

272

Our model demonstrates that if 81.5% of people aged 20-49 participate in the program, the

273

probability of contracting the virus for non-participants from the general population is 40% if

274

mitigation measures and social distancing are not released after the CA is fully exhausted,

275

and 71% if they are released. It also shows that the CA program is almost fully exhausted

276

after 200 days. If mitigation measures and social distancing are lifted immediately following

277

the end of the program, this implies that anyone not joining the program expects to lose

278

earning opportunities for this period of time. The two variables – alternative risk of exposure

279

to the virus, and time before resumption of normal life – affect the decision whether to join

280

the program. As we explain in the supplementary part, there is some rational expectations

281

equilibrium, such that all people who may join the program, actually choose to do so. The

282

maximum participation age established by such an equilibrium may prove lower than the one

283

analyzed in the model – 50.

284

Moreover, ethical considerations (also presented in the supplement) may further require

285

lowering the maximum age for participation in the program. Since exposure under the

286

program is voluntary, consent-based criteria support the exposure of young people.

287

Furthermore, since exposed people are isolated, and once they recover and become immune,

288

they rejoin the general population, their exposure reduces negative externalities to other

289

people, and hence public health (and furthermore, social welfare) concerns also support their

290

exposure. The remaining concern is whether the state should impose a limitation on voluntary

291

assumption of risk, due to paternalistic considerations. These considerations do establish a

292

maximum level of risk – or maximum age, above which voluntary exposure cannot be

293

justified. It may therefore well be that the demand for participation in the program would

294

exceed the maximum age allowed. The implementation problem may then be how to prevent

295

higher risk individuals from independently contracting the virus.

296

To implement CA, governments must have the political will to commit to a program that

297

combines isolation/closure with voluntary exposure for a pre-defined time period. Given

298

extreme suppression measures that governments have implemented, it would seem reasonable

299

that controlled, voluntary exposure could be managed. Rather than opening businesses and

300

public spaces to all low risk groups, thus risking uncontrolled disease spread including to

301

vulnerable populations, governments can leverage success in suppression policies to move to

302

a CA program.

303

Implementation of the program does not imply that professional personnel will infect people

304

similar to challenge studies. Rather, the government can provide the tools and environment

305

for whoever likes to contract infection to perform it easily and in a regulated manner.

306

Suppression resources may be turned to enforcement of rules regarding screening of applicant

307

volunteers, monitoring mechanisms and patterns of infection, recovery and immunity among

308

309

Transparent information regarding CA policy, its uptake, and case studies of volunteers’

310

experiences should be provided to the public, the media and, in particular, target groups for

311

voluntary exposure. The public, which in many countries has demonstrated its ability to

312

understand and adhere to pandemic related information and edicts, must understand, as much

313

as possible, the risks and benefits of CA to both individuals and society. It would seem they

314

are currently primed to do so (27).

315

While the anticipated morbidity and mortality among volunteers for CA is expected to be

316

lower than other routinely undertaken risks, government should offer suitable recognition and

317

compensation to volunteers who suffer health setbacks and to their families in case of

318

mortality due to participation. Participants in the program may also be offered to volunteer

319

for studies exploring important questions such as the length of protective immunity. Plasma

320

donated by recovered patients can be used to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients (28, 29).

321

The program may be later adjusted for recruiting volunteers to challenge studies, enhancing

322

the licensure of vaccines, a practice that was recently suggested by several leading scientists

323

and was claimed to be ethically justified in the current situation (30).

324

Elimination of this particular threat cannot materialize until adequate herd immunity is

325

reached. It is therefore time for policy makers to include herd immunity as the main goal in

326

the array of policy options. The health, economic, and social costs of all the options to

327

achieve this goal need to be more fully evaluated, compared and discussed. These

328

considerations must include the avoidance of getting stuck in one policy direction, sober

329

confronting of the ethical concerns regarding societal attitudes towards risk taking and more

330

complete assessment of the tradeoffs among health impact, economic impact and social

331

capital. This will require a multi sector, professional and representative task force to manage

332

policy options such as CA and the Covid-19 crisis in general.

FIG. 1. Schematic flow diagram for the Avalanche model. The model describes the Covid-19

345

dynamics in a given population, which is divided to five compartments: S – Susceptible, E –

346

exposed, I – Infectious, R – Recovered and immune, D – Deceased. The population is divided

347

to two: The general population (ages 0-19 and 50-) and the low-risk labor-age population

348

(ages 20-49), that is indicated by L subscript. From the L population volunteers are recruited

349

to the controlled avalanche program that is indicated by A subscript.
