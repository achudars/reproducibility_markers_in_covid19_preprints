Summary
The perspective of vaccination to protect human population from infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus has
great potential to control the pandemic. Nevertheless, vaccine planning requires phased introduction
with age groups, health workers, and vulnerable people. We developed a mathematical model capable
of capturing the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 dissemination aligned with social distancing, isolation
measures, and vaccination. The city of Rio de Janeiro provides a case study to analyze possible
scenarios including non–pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination in the epidemic scenario. Our
results shows that a combination of different policies such as case isolation and social distancing are
more effective for mitigating the epidemics. Furthermore, these policies will still be necessary in a
phased vaccination program. Therefore, health surveillance activities should be maintained along
with vaccination planning in scheduled groups until a large vaccinated coverage is reached.

Introduction

2

Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the COVID-19 pandemic reached many countries

3

causing millions of severe cases and deaths. The need of interventions were necessary to mitigate

4

the pandemic by reducing dissemination and in the next phase by starting vaccination. Even with a

5

phased vaccination, some measures remain important such as social distancing and isolation of cases

6

until large vaccine coverage is achieved.
A number of models studied the impact of social distancing [1]. Models range from understanding

7

8

the epidemiological mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 and also to predict the dynamics of epidemic.

9

A schematic review by Wynants evaluates diverse models against their predictive capabilities [2].

10

Among the effects expected from these interventions, the first one is delaying the peak of the

11

pandemic, which is important in order to healthcare organizations better prepare methods, personnel

12

and equipment to deal with the coming hospitalizations and cases. The second and most wanted is

13

flattening the pandemic curve once it starts, the goal of this objective is to open ease the resources

14

allocation and to give more time to the healthcare system to handle the pandemic and its effects.

15

Vaccination should provide the approach for controlling it, depending on the vaccine efficacy.

16

In this work, we evaluate how different scenarios of interventions compare to each other in order

17

to better deal with the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results also consider the city of Rio de

18

Janeiro, Brazil, as case study. Implications of the results, however, are general, such that could be

19

extended to other similar cities. Also, as non-pharmaceutical measures are key to mitigate effects of

20

the pandemic, the perspective of controlling it comes with vaccination. Yet, its policies and methods

21

for application need yet to be systematically addressed. At present, there is already the surge of

22

a second-wave in many countries [3, 4]. Health surveillance should be maintained along with the

23

planning for effective vaccination.

2.1

26

We modeled different scenarios with an ODE-based compartmental model. In the model, susceptible

27

individuals (S) can evolve to exposed (E) conditions when in contact with infected individuals. The

28

group of infected individuals is divided between asymptomatic cases (Y), symptomatic cases (C),

29

which includes both mild and moderate cases, and severe cases (H). This last group occurs from the

30

evolution of the symptomatic group and, therefore, is considered hospitalized. All infected individuals

31

can evolve to death (D) or recovered (R). Each one of these model classes is stratified by age group

ranging from 5 to 5 years, from 0 to 100 years, added by one last age group of higher than 100 years,

33

in a total of 21 groups of distinct age ranges for each compartment of the model.

34

We also included the possibility of vaccination in our model. Susceptible individuals are vaccinated

35

at a coverage rate of η. These vaccinated individuals will take a pre-determined time τimmun to

36

develop immunity at a probability of ρI when they evolve to immunized status (I). Due to incomplete

37

vaccine efficacy, we included the possibility of the vaccinated individual not developing the required

38

immunization and, therefore, being a susceptible-but-deemed-immunized individual (Im). These

39

individuals are in a separate compartment apart from susceptible individuals because the former

40

might lessen their social distancing and isolation measures, thinking that now they are immunized

41

and somewhat away from the danger.

42

The infection rate between susceptible individuals and symptomatic is β, and with asymptomatic

43

individuals is βA . When they become exposed individuals, the time to evolve to infected is the

44

incubation time τinc . At the end of this time, the individual has a probability ρS of developing

45

symptoms.

46

−1
The time for an asymptomatic individual might evolve to death is αA
, whereas for the symptomatic

47

cases is α−1 , α > αA due to expected morbidity in these groups, including that asymptomatic

48

individuals do not present themselves as clinical cases. The symptomatic individual can evolve to a

49

severe case with a risk probability of αH .

50

The recovery of infected individuals (symptomatic and severe) is controlled by the recovery rate

51

γ, being modified to γH in the case of severe cases. Severe case are hospitalized and thus receiving

52

proper assistance confronting the sickness. The hospitalized individual can recover after a determined

53

period, controlled by the discharge time τdisc and dyspnea time τdisp .

2.1.1

Social distancing interventions

55

The model enables the application of intervention measures with the social distancing of specific age

56

groups. Social distancing affects people in reducing the probability of encounters between infected

57

and susceptible individuals. Thus, we simulate this condition by reducing the infection rates β, βA ,

58

βI and βIm for the specific age groups. Due to imperfect application of social distancing intervention,

59

each intervention is controlled by a success rate.

60

The fact that the model is stratified by age groups opens a new range of different scenarios, e.g.,

61

when applying the social distancing intervention to younger age groups, we can simulate a closed

62

schools condition. The reduction is applied to the R0 , from which the infection rates are calculated,

63

value multiplying it by the reduction factor κ with a pre-defined value. The social distancing applied

64

to the 0-20 years old age groups is labeled SD-Y, when applied to the age groups higher than 60 years

65

old is labeled SD-E, and when we apply the reduction to all age groups, we label this condition as

66

SD-A.

67

2.1.2

68

The application of isolation interventions is made by reducing the encounter probability between

69

susceptible and infected individuals. Different scenarios are tested in this work. In the lockdown

70

scenario (L), we alter the susceptible flow equation to

Another intervention possibility is when tests are applied to the individuals, and a quarantine

72

is applied where symptomatic cases are isolated with a probability σ and asymptomatic with a

73

probability σA , this condition is labeled as TQ-C. In this scenario, we modify the susceptible flow

74

equation to

2.1.3

Stochastic implementation

89

The model is implemented with a discrete-time fashion. Typically, for each time step all transitions

90

are evaluated as probabilities and the number flowing from a compartment to the other linked

91

compartments, including keeping the state, are drawn from a multinomial distribution.

92

2.2

93

Parameters of the model were adjusted to number of cases and the dynamics observed in the

94

municipality of Rio de Janeiro. Data from Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) are compared

95

to the results of new daily hospitalizations. In contrast, data from Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI)

96

notified cases are compared to the results of new daily cases. All notified data is retrieved from the

97

public database OpenDataSus (available at https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset).

Case study

98

Throughout the pandemic, the scenario was altered several times due to governmental decisions

99

of applying the interventions or making them more flexible and the incomplete adherence of the

100

population. In this section, we evaluate how the model behaves when we use the same quarantine

101

severity as applied by the government for each period while comparing the results to real-time data.

102

Our approach is based on the Rio de Janeiro municipality and state real pandemic decrees, with

103

small adjustments. We consider no intervention done between 01 January 2020 and 15 March 2020

104

(day 1 to day 74). Starting from 16 March 2020 until 27 March 2020 (day 75 to day 86), we consider

105

that this is the beginning of the pandemic, where the government started to apply some intervention

106

measures. However, the population was still not impacted by the severity of the pandemic. Therefore

107

we considered the social distancing of young age and elderly groups, together with the quarantine of

108

only severe cases.

109

From 28 March 2020 to 4 April 2020 (day 87 to day 107), social distancing becomes more

110

widespread, and therefore we consider a social distancing of all age groups. From 5 April 2020 to

111

14 May 2020, the interventions become more restrictive, and now the isolation of cases extends to

112

symptomatic cases when confirmed by testing. A higher isolation rate is considered between the dates

113

of 15 May 2020 and 29 May 2020. On 30 May 2020, up to 2 June 2020, intervention measures start

114

to loosen, and the isolation is loosened to the isolation of symptomatic, asymptomatic, and severe

115

cases. To reflect this change, the probability of successful isolating symptomatic cases varies from

116

0.75 to 0.60. Proceeding with flexibilization, from 3 June 2020 to 12 July 2020, the quarantine of

117

asymptomatic cases is abandoned. The last intervention change is from 13 July 2020 to 31 October

118

2020, when social distancing is loosened to only social distancing of young and elderly groups.

119

To better fit the model to the real notification data, we estimated R0 = 2.6, the reduction factor

120

of the social distancing to be 0.72, the success in isolating symptomatic cases to be 0.60, while 0.20 for

121

the asymptomatic cases. Also, we considered that the first cases were imported on 11 February 2020..

122

Reporting rate of severe cases (SARI) are 96% of the real cases, accounting for small under-reporting,

123

whereas under-reporting of notified ARI disease cases are 20% of the actual number of ARI cases.

124

The number of SARI cases notified in the city of Rio de Janeiro, daily aggregated, is evaluated

125

from January to the end of October of 2020. Regarding the ARI notified cases, the data is evaluated

126

from January to the end of September of 2020. This data range is considered an acceptable range to

127

avoid the effect of dramatic sub notification due to notification delay.

128

2.3

129

Vaccination schedules are still being studied for SARS-CoV-2, with different strategies being applied

130

due to diverse factors [10]. However, we expect that this schedule might closely follow other

131

respiratory syndromes’ vaccination, like influenza. In this work, we will consider an effective, tight,

132

and compromised vaccination program to assess if this would be enough to halt the pandemic

133

effectively. Therefore, our vaccination schedule is comprised of 4 phases, each lasting for 15 days.

134

In the first phase, individuals older than 60 years old are vaccinated at a rate of 1.0%. Critical

135

risk workers and people with comorbidities and underlying conditions (in the age of 21 to 59 years

136

old) are not specifically modeled but these other adult ages are vaccinated at 0.1% per day. In the

137

second phase, more young adults are included (more critical risk workers, school staff, individuals

138

with disabilities), raising the group’s vaccination rate to 0.5%. In the third phase, all young adults

139

and children are included at a rate of 1.0% per day, whilst individuals older than 60 years old are

140

vaccinated at a rate of 0.1% per day. In the fourth and final phase, individuals of all groups are

141

allowed to be vaccinated at a rate of 1.0% per day.

142

143

In order to better evaluate the effect of different interventions separately, we compare the number of

144

daily deaths and daily hospitalizations for different interventions using a population of the size of the

145

city of Rio de Janeiro.

146

As shown in Fig.2, there is a marked difference in the effectiveness of each intervention alone.

147

All the cases in which social distancing was applied alone had a less pronounced effect than the

148

quarantine of cases scenarios, except for the quarantine of only the severe cases (TS), which had a

149

minimal delaying effect at the peak. A combination of mitigation policies makes significant impact in

150

the peak of number of cases.

151

As our model is stratified by age groups, we also observe how the different interventions change

152

the number of deaths and hospitalizations by age, as shown by Fig.3. The quarantine of all cases, the

153

social distancing of all individuals, and the combination of this intervention with the quarantine of

154

symptomatic cases are the three most effective interventions, as also seen by Fig.2. In all cases, despite

155

isolating or distancing different age groups, the pattern of hospitalizations and deaths regarding age

156

groups is very similar. The major difference is observed in delaying the pandemic peak and the

157

pandemic’s length, broadening its profile through time, but not through age groups. Hospitalizations

158

are centered around older groups, mainly individuals around 60 years old and older, in all interventions.

159

Concerning hospitalizations, there is a more even distribution among age groups. However, it is

160

essential to note that hospitalizations of young age individuals (younger than 30 years old) are

161

considerably pronounced.

162

Also, in Figure 3, despite profile similarity across age groups, some age groups are more affected

163

since the beginning of the pandemic and at the end. There is a distortion of the profile’s rectangular

164

shape observed in almost all scenarios, in favor of a more oval-oriented shape, which is more pronounced

165

in the SD-A and TQ, only TQ, and only TQ-C scenarios.

166

Regarding the case study of Rio de Janeiro municipality, as shown by Fig. 4, the model presents

167

an excellent fit given number of SARI and ARI cases. The model captured the dynamics in Rio de

168

Janeiro successfully regarding the hospitalizations compared to SARI notified cases. Regarding the

169

influenza-like illness, the model does not account for all influenza-like illness, but it is limited to

170

SARS-CoV-2 cases. Therefore, its reporting parameter being only 0.80.

171

The results from evaluating different scenarios of flexibilization are shown in Fig.4. Maintaining

172

the actual quarantine and social distancing status as of the end of October still gives the pandemic the

173

chance to be on the rise, reaching a peak only in few months. If the social distancing is abandoned,

174

then there is a stronger rise in the pandemic. Halting the cases rise and changing its course happens

175

when both the quarantine and social distancing are enforced.

176

177

Even though a second peak is not yet reached in Rio de Janeiro as of now by the official notified
data, it is seen in Fig. 4 that ARI notified cases are on the rise.

178

Fig.5 shows the comparison between two vaccination dates to be studied. As expected, the sooner

179

the vaccination program begins, the sooner the number of new daily hospitalizations and deaths start

180

to fall. However, it is worth mentioning that social distancing and quarantine are still maintained in

181

all three scenarios.

during the vaccination rollout, we simulated the conditions presented at Fig.6. Fig.6 also shows that

184

in the scenarios in which social distancing and quarantine are present, and in the case of only the

185

quarantine is considered, vaccination plays a fundamental role. When vaccination starts, this downfall

186

is advanced and accelerated, which is evidenced by the observed inflection point. Abandoning social

187

distancing, however, generates an increase in the number of expected SARI cases.

The main objective of NPI interventions is to mitigate the effect of the pandemic for a proper health

190

care attention to mild and severe cases. As shown by Fig.2 independently from the nature of the

191

intervention (social distancing or isolation of cases), as expected and seen in many studies [1, 11–13],

192

delaying the epidemic peak is a consequence of the reduction in transmission intensity.

Discussion

193

When comparing the different interventions, the combination of social distancing and isolation

194

showed the best results, as demonstrated in Fig.2. When comparing the isolation interventions, there

195

is a huge difference between the isolation of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and isolating

196

only the symptomatic cases, with the first one being the most successful application. This result

197

highlights the importance of an enforced isolation measure, as the asymptomatic cases also impact in

198

the transmission dynamics. The correct identification and consequently isolation of these cases pose a

199

problem which has been discussed in the actual pandemic [14, 15], in some cases, following the correct

200

procedure to identify and isolate these cases were responsible for ending the pandemic [16]. The

201

isolation of only the severe cases did not do much to alter the behavior of the pandemic, demonstrating

202

the importance of having a model in which mild and severe cases are studied separately, as they

203

have marked differences in their epidemiology [17, 18] besides having some studies indicating some

204

similarities [19, 20]. The only case in which the isolation of only the symptomatic cases was effective,

205

was when it was applied altogether with the social distancing of all age groups. Therefore, it is

206

imperative to recognize the importance of transmission by asymptomatic individuals.

207

Comparing the applied social distancing measures, results here show a very marked difference

208

between the isolation of all age groups against the isolation of only young or elderly individuals

209

and the severity of SARS-CoV-2 among elderly individuals higher than younger individuals [18, 20].

210

However, there must be a very careful distinction between the severity of cases and the epidemiological

211

dynamic imposed by the different groups, the isolation of only the elder individuals is not sufficient

212

to significantly halter the pandemic. As shown in our model, isolating the elderly group may give a

213

false impression of protection to these individuals, as this intervention is not sufficient to effectively

214

stop the epidemic, they are not effectively protected and still being subjected to be infected, and

215

therefore, develop a severe case. Therefore, only the social distancing of all age groups at an early

216

stage acts to avoid severe cases.

217

The social distancing of all age groups had similar performance compared to the isolation of

218

both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, as shown by Fig.2. This interesting result indicates

219

that the early recognition and application of broad interventions to the population are the most

220

effective measures to be studied. That is, acting with the objective of diminishing the number of

221

possible infections through social distancing of healthy individuals or at the successful isolation of

222

infected individuals is, as expected, equally important. The most important observation to be taken

223

into account is that this intervention should be broad. In regard to the social distancing, all age

224

groups should be taken into account, in agreement with other modeling studies [11, 12]. Regarding

225

the isolation intervention, all cases should be included in the measure, including asymptomatic cases,

226

which can only be reached through successful testing. This highlights the importance of mass testing

227

individuals exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

228

Despite the great number of interventions, either a social distancing or isolation intervention,

229

the best approach is clearly the combination of both measures. This is shown in 2 where the SD-A

230

intervention combined with the TQ isolation measure produced the best results.

231

Despite all of the interventions, combined or not, act in a way to suppress the pandemic with

232

different success rates, it is important to remember that there is a growing concern about the social

233

and economic distress of a population during interventions [21, 22]. It is imperative to also observe

234

and develop pharmaceutical interventions that are capable of reducing and really ending the posed

235

a threat by the virus. Also, initiatives such as the vaccines being developed and the fundamental

236

understanding of how the virus acts biologically are important to this end. Therefore, it is important

237

to model beyond the dynamics of only non-pharmaceutical interventions.

238

Non-pharmaceutical interventions also demonstrate through Fig.4 that they have the merit of

239

controlling the direction, evolution, and severity of the pandemic and should be studied and applied

240

whenever possible. However, as shown by Figs.5 and 6, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical

241

interventions need to be considered altogether during the pandemic. Considering these results, it is

242

clear that the vaccine has a long-term effect on the population. The vaccination schedule in this work

243

is likely optimistic, mainly regarding the period of only 15 days between each phase and the vaccine

244

requiring only one dose to be effective, while works in the literature already point out that two doses

245

are going to be the required minimum for a good number of vaccine candidates [23, 24]. However,

246

we wanted to test how a large, focused, and effective vaccination schedule would behave, and we see

247

that not even a program with these characteristics is not subjected to the need of allowing NPI to be

248

taken into account.

249

In all scenarios, the phased rollout of the vaccination program should be along with maintaining

250

social distancing and case isolation. Abandoning the quarantine shows to be a most critical scenario,

251

in which there is a considerable increase in the number of hospitalizations. The only condition where

252

the pandemic maintains its downward strategy during the vaccination program is combining social

253

distancing and quarantine. The scenario in which social distancing is more flexible shows an increase

254

in the number of hospitalizations.

255

This is a crucial moment to study and show that we must yet consider the application of strict

256

interventions of social distancing, isolation, and vaccination as the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission

257

is present in multiple countries. The modelling in this work shows that effective control of the

258

COVID-19 pandemic requires a combination of these efforts.
