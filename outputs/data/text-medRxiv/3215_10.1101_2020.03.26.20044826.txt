ABSTRACT

38

The role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains highly controversial. To address this

39

issue, we performed a meta-analysis of the published literature on household SARS-CoV-2

40

transmission clusters (n=213 from 12 countries). Only 8 (3.8%) transmission clusters were

41

identified as having a paediatric index case. Asymptomatic index cases were associated with

42

a lower secondary attack in contacts than symptomatic index cases (estimate risk ratio [RR],

43

0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.29). To determine the susceptibility of children to

44

household infections the secondary attack rate (SAR) in paediatric household contacts was

45

assessed. The secondary attack rate in paediatric household contacts was lower than in adult

46

household contacts (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.91). These data have important implications for

47

the ongoing management of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential vaccine

48

prioritization strategies.

INTRODUCTION

62

At the time of writing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has

63

infected >50 million people resulting in >1 million deaths [1].Large data analyses have shown

64

that the elderly are particularly susceptible to severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019

65

(COVID-19) [2]. However, the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains

66

controversial [3-9]. During a typical influenza virus season, children have been identified as

67

having the highest infection rate of any age group (up to 43%). Accordingly, children may play

68

a major role in the spread of influenza virus and are a key target population for influenza

69

vaccination to prevent infection and reduce transmission[10]. In the context of coronaviruses,

70

paediatric infections with SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS are typically mild [9, 10].

71

Nevertheless, a lower incidence of clinical symptoms raises concerns that children could be

72

an important, undetected source of SARS-CoV-2 in transmission in the community [8, 11].

73

Answering this question is of key importance to public health as it will help identify priority

74

groups for vaccination. However, findings remain controversial, with some studies suggesting

75

that children may play a key role in disease transmission and shed virus at equivalent titres to

76

adults [12-17]. In contrast, others find little evidence of paediatric infections or spread [7, 8,

77

18-21]. Moreover, it is unclear if SARS-CoV-2 transmission differs amongst children of

78

differing age groups.

79
80

Studying the source and route of viral transmission from children in the community is fraught

81

with difficulties, due to the multiple different potential sources of infection. Furthermore, it

82

is thought that households are one of the most common settings in SARS-CoV-2 transmission

83

[22]. Household transmission clusters therefore offer the unique opportunity to study viral

84

transmission and susceptibility to infection in a more defined setting.

To address the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we performed a meta-

87

analysis on household transmission clusters. We investigated prevalence of paediatric index

88

cases in household transmission clusters of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the secondary attack rate

89

(SAR) of different age groups.

METHODS

110

Definitions

111

A household transmission cluster was defined as a group of ≥ 2 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-

112

2 infections in co-habiting individuals in whom the diagnosis of cases occurred within 2 weeks

113

of each other. The index case was defined as the individual in the household cluster who first

114

developed symptoms. Household contacts were defined as co-habiting individuals, typically

115

family members, close relatives, housemates or house helpers. An individual with laboratory

116

confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was considered to be infected. Household secondary attack rates

117

were defined as the proportion of confirmed infections among all household contacts. Unless

118

otherwise stated, adults were defined as individuals >18 years whilst children were defined

119

as individuals <18 years of age.

120
121

Data collection

122

Following the PRISMA statement for the reporting of meta-analysis [23], we searched

123

published, de-identified, data made available between Dec 1, 2019, and August 24, 2020.

124

Information was accessed from the World Health Organization news11, Google Scholar,

125

PubMed, the Lancet COVID-19 resource centre12, Clinical Infectious Disease Journal and New

126

England Journal of Medicine. We searched for databases using the search terms (“COVID-19”

127

OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR) AND (“household transmission” OR “family cluster” OR “household

128

contact”) AND (“transmissibility” OR “attack rate”). To identify missing studies, we checked

129

the reference list for each selected paper. Studies that were duplicate publications, pre-prints

130

and/or reviews were excluded (Figure 1).

132

Our search strategy aimed to identify all articles that assessed the prevalence of children as

133

index cases in a family SARS-CoV-2 cluster and/or the secondary attack rate of children and

134

adults in household transmission clusters. Depending on the level of information available,

135

studies were included in the index case analysis or the secondary attack rate meta-analysis.

136
137

All studies included in the index case analysis were household SARS-CoV-2 transmission

138

clusters that i) identified the index case of the cluster ii) defined the number of infected

139

contacts in the household and iii) recorded the initial disease onset date of all cases in the

140

cluster.

141
142

All studies included in the secondary attack rate meta-analysis were household SARS-CoV-2

143

transmission clusters that i) defined the secondary attack rate within the cluster and ii)

144

defined the age of contact cases in the cluster. Studies which did not meet bare minimum

145

data required for the index case analysis nor the secondary attack rate meta-analysis were

146

excluded (Figure 1). Where the same family cluster was included in more than published

147

report, data was only extracted from one study. Collected data was verified by a second

148

researcher.

149
150

Statistical analysis

151

Susceptibility to infection was estimated by calculating the secondary attack rate for

152

household close contacts associated with the index case in each transmission cluster. We

153

estimated the Relative Risk (RRs) for SARS CoV-2 infection stratified by the age of household

154

contacts for each study. We then pooled these RRs using a random effects model with

155

DerSimonian and Laird weights[24]. We used a random effects model, equalizing the weight

156

of the studies to the pooled estimate. Where relevant, we stratified the analysis by pre-

157

specified characteristics. 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess statistical

158

significance in all models. The I2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity between studies.

159

A threshold of I2>50% was used as indicating statistically significant heterogeneity. All

160

summary analyses and meta-analysis were performed using R statistical software (version

161

3.6.1).

RESULTS

181

We identified 1208 articles that described SARS-CoV-2 household transmission clusters,

182

rejected 1151 articles due to a lack of sufficient and or appropriate data and derived a total

183

of 57 articles. Household transmission clusters were drawn from cases in 12 countries: China,

184

Japan, France, Germany, Italy, USA, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Morocco, Greece and

185

South Korea. 43 articles were included in the index case analysis[5, 25-66] whilst 14 articles

186

were used in the secondary attack rate meta-analysis[66-79]. The full detail of all family

187

clusters and characteristics of studies included in meta-analysis are shown in Supplementary

188

Tables 1 and 2.

189
190

Children are infrequently identified as the index case of household SARS-CoV-2 clusters

191

In analysis of the cluster index cases, we included 43 articles, in which there were 213 SARS-

192

CoV-2 transmission clusters and only 3.8% (8/213) were identified as having a paediatric index

193

case (Table 1 & Supplementary Tables 1 & 3). Of 611 individuals in the 213 clusters there were

194

102 children. These paediatric cases only caused 4.0% (16/398) of all secondary cases,

195

compared to the 97.8% of secondary cases that occurred when an adult was identified as the

196

index case in the cluster (Table 1).

197
198

The limited number of defined SARS-CoV-2 household clusters with children as the index case

199

could have been influenced by the fact that COVID-19 in children is frequently asymptomatic

200

[11]. Accordingly, it is possible that within a household cluster, children were not correctly

201

identified as the index case of the infection (i.e. the first to develop symptoms) and were

202

instead mistakenly identified as a contact case. To exclude this possibility, we reanalysed the

203

data looking at household clusters where a paediatric contact case was SARS-CoV-2 positive

204

but asymptomatic. In such a scenario we assumed the child to be the ‘true’ index case of the

205

cluster. Clusters where the asymptomatic/symptomatic status of the contact cases was not

206

described were excluded from the analysis. Even with this broader definition, only 39 (18.5%)

207

children were identified as the index case in the household clusters (Table 2).

208
209

It is also possible that these data were influenced by the fact that early in the SARS-CoV-2

210

outbreak, infections were associated with travel to outbreak areas (i.e. initially to Wuhan

211

itself and later to the entirety of Hubei). Travel is much more likely to be undertaken by an

212

adult in the family, potentially cofounding the results. To control for this factor, we reanalysed

213

the data only including household transmission clusters where the index case had no history

214

of travel or the whole family was associated with an outbreak area. Clusters where this

215

information was not available were excluded from the analysis. This resulted in a total 152

216

index cases, 32 of which (21.1%) were identified as having a child as the index case in the

217

cluster (Table 3).

218
219

A final factor which may have confounded this analysis is the fact that in some countries a

220

strict lockdown was imposed during the period of data collection. This would have limited the

221

activity of children outside of the house and may therefore have artificially reduced the

222

number of children identified as an index case. To control for this factor, a sub-analysis was

223

performed only using data collected when the regional area or country was not in a period of

224

‘lockdown’. In this sub-analysis only 3.0% of clusters were associated with a paediatric index

225

case (Table 4, Supplementary Table 1).

226
227

Asymptomatic index cases are associated with a lower secondary attack rate

10

228

We then further examined the household clusters identified in Table 1 where a child was

229

identified as the index case in order to define the secondary attack rate of cohabiting family

230

members (Supplementary Table 4). Clusters where the total number of infected and

231

uninfected family members was not recorded was excluded from the analysis. Accordingly,

232

sufficient information was only available to calculate the secondary attack rate of five clusters

233

with a paediatric index case (mean = 46.7%; SD = 28.2%). Three of these index cases were <

234

10 years and 3 index cases were aged 10 – 19 years. Only 22 clusters with an adult index case

235

were eligible for this analysis (mean = 65.8%; SD = 23.3%) (Supplementary Table 5). Therefore,

236

there was insufficient case numbers to determine whether children are more or less able to

237

transmit SARS-CoV-2 in a household setting compared to adult index cases.

238
239

It has previously been suggested that asymptomatic individuals may be less infectious than

240

those who develop symptoms [7, 80, 81]. The prevalence of mild/asymptomatic infections in

241

children may therefore affect the secondary attack rate in SARS-CoV-2 household clusters

242

where children were identified as the index case. To assess this possibility, we examined the

243

secondary attack rate in household clusters where the index case was symptomatic vs. the

244

secondary attack rate in household clusters where the index case was asymptomatic, (but

245

known to be SARS-CoV-2 positive Figure 2). Asymptomatic index cases were associated with

246

a significantly lower secondary attack in contacts than symptomatic index cases RR = 0.17 (95%

247

CI, 0.09-0.29), although a significant overall effect was observed with heterogeneity (I2=87%,

248

P<0.01).

251

Children have a lower secondary attack rate than adults in household SARS-CoV-2

252

transmission clusters

253

Several studies have suggested that children are less likely than adults to be infected with

254

SARS-CoV-2 [20, 82]. However, small scale studies can be biased by the fact that community

255

testing is often only performed on symptomatic individuals, few of whom may be children.

256
257

We therefore used the second data set collected in this study to examine the secondary attack

258

rate of children versus adults in household clusters where adults were identified as an index

259

case. In 11 observational studies of household transmission clusters, the secondary attack

260

rate in tested paediatric household contacts (<18 years old) was significantly lower than that

261

in adult household contacts RR=0.62 (95% CI, 0.42-0.91) (Figure 3).

262
263

In a subset analysis where additional information was provided on the age of the paediatric

264

contact, younger children (<10 years) were no more or less susceptible to infection compared

265

to older children (>10 years) RR = 0.69 (95% CI, 0.26-1.82) with no significant heterogeneity

266

(I2=33%, P=0.17, Figure 4). Together, these data suggest that children (<18 years old) are less

267

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in a household transmission cluster.

DISCUSSION

276

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to and from children has remained controversial throughout

277

the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the present study, we only recorded a limited

278

number of household transmission clusters (3.8%) where children (<18 years) were identified

279

as the index case. This observation is supported by previous study from China, where a study

280

of 66 family transmission clusters showed that children were never the first in the family to

281

be diagnosed with COVID-19 [83]. Other reviews have also found limited evidence of children

282

as the index case in household transmission clusters [4, 20]. Indeed, in a family based study

283

by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment there were no

284

indications in any of the 54 participating families that a child <12 years old was the source of

285

COVID-19 within the family[84]. A more recent study of households in Tennessee and

286

Wisconsin suggested that of 101 family SARS-CoV-2 clusters, only 14 had paediatric index

287

cases [85].

288
289

There are multiple possible reasons as to why children may be infrequently identified as the

290

index case in household transmission clusters. This may reflect limited interaction of children

291

outside the home during the period in question or the higher probably of an adult traveling

292

to a COVID-19 endemic area than a child (. An alternate hypothesis is that children are less

293

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults. Indeed, this is consistent with our

294

observation that in household transmission clusters, children were significantly less likelyto

295

acquire SARS-CoV-2 than their adult family members. Interestingly, we found that older

296

children were not significantly more likely than younger children to acquire the virus, in

297

contrast to previous pre-print suggestions [4].

13

299

A reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children outside the home has previously

300

been reported [2, 4, 8, 18]. [86]. [87]. Indeed, these data are congruent with survey data from

301

Vo’, Italy [88]. Here, all age groups were homogenously sampled yet no children tested

302

positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was despite the fact that at least 13 of these children

303

lived together with infected family members [88].

304
305

Once infected, it remains to be determined as to whether children are more or less likely to

306

transmit the SARS-CoV-2 to a family member as an infected adult. Whilst the mean number

307

of infected household members was lower when a child was identified as the index case of

308

the cluster, the low number of clusters eligible for inclusion in this analysis precluded any

309

definitive conclusions. However, these data are consistent with recent U.S. data suggesting

310

that the SAR from paediatric index cases (18 years old) was less than that of adults (43% and

311

57% respectively) [86]. It has previously been suggested that children are less likely to

312

transmit SARS-CoV-2 compared to adults [7, 8, 18-20]. Such suggestions have remained

313

controversial amongst other findings that children have equivalent nasopharyngeal viral loads

314

to adults [14, 16, 17]. However, reanalysis of the aforementioned studies have shown that i)

315

young children (<10 years old) did indeed have a significantly lower viral load [19] ii) that the

316

comparison was being performed between children in the first 2 days of symptoms and

317

hospitalized adults with severe disease[17] and iii) datasets included few children younger

318

than 16 years[16]. Similarly, pre-print suggestions that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to

319

contacts is greatest from infected individuals <14 years old may be affected by limited case

320

numbers in this age group (14/1489 total cases)[12].

Should children be less likely to transmit the virus, it is interesting to speculate the possible

323

mechanism by which this occurs. There is an emerging body of evidence that mild or

324

asymptomatic patients are less infectious than those with pronounced clinical symptoms [7,

325

13, 80, 81, 89]. Indeed, our meta-analysis showed that an asymptomatic index case was

326

associated with a significantly lower secondary attack rate compared to a symptomatic index

327

case. It is therefore tempting to hypothesise that children may be less infectious than adults

328

infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to their more mild clinical manifestation of disease. However,

329

such a hypothesis requires validation across a larger and more diverse dataset.

330
331

The present study was subject to several important limitations. Firstly, as we were

332

conservative during the data collection only a limited number of studies were included,

333

potentially contributing to the high I2 value observed. This study also assumes that SARS-CoV-

334

2 infections in the household contacts of infected individual were the result of a direct

335

transmission event. However, it is possible that the household contact acquired the virus from

336

another source (e.g. from community exposure) and that the first in the family to develop

337

symptoms was not necessarily the index case. We were also unable to control for the chance

338

of a ‘common exposure’ where two individuals were infected by the same source at the same

339

time, but one individual was incorrectly identified as the sole index case of the cluster as they

340

were the first to develop symptoms. Indeed, this appears to have confounded the analysis of

341

a series of family clusters identified in South Korea [5, 15]. It is also important to note that we

342

were unable to differentiate between pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and

343

therefore the number of identified asymptomatically infected individuals may be

344

overestimated. Finally, it is important to note that these data should not be extrapolated to

345

SARS-CoV-2 transmission outside the home where children tend to make more social contacts

346

than adults[18]. This could significantly influence transmission dynamics in the community

347

setting, although our data are congruent with the low rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in

348

Australian schools [90].

349
350

We are almost one year into the COVID-19 pandemic and many countries are still struggling

351

to control outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. At the time of writing, numerous countries in Europe

352

have been forced into a second lockdown. However, unlike the first lockdown many countries

353

(including the U.K. and Germany) have elected to keep schools open. The data presented in

354

this manuscript suggest that should children become infected at school during this period,

355

they are unlikely to spread SARS-CoV-2 to their co-habiting family members.

356
357

There is now a growing body of evidence that a safe and at least partially effective vaccine

358

will be soon licenced for human use. However, due to the global demands, SARS-CoV-2

359

vaccines are likely to be first administered to pre-defined priority populations. Whilst

360

prioritising the vaccination children against influenza has proved an effective tool in the

361

reducing the spread of influenza virus in the community[10], our data suggest that a similar

362

strategy would be unlikely to significantly decrease the household transmission of SARS-CoV-
