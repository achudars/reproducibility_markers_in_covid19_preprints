Abstract

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought huge strain on hospitals worldwide. It is
crucial that we gain a deeper understanding of hospital resilience in this unprecedented
moment. This paper aims to report the key strategies and recommendations in terms of
hospitals and professionals’ resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the quality and
limitations of research in this field at present.

Methods: We conducted a scoping review of evidence on the resilience of hospitals and their
staff during the COVID-19 crisis in the first half of 2020. The Stephen B. Thacker CDC
Library website was used to identify papers meeting the eligibility criteria, from which we
selected 65 publications. After having extracted data, we presented the results synthesis using
an “effects-strategies-impacts” resilience framework.

Results: We found a wealth of research rapidly produced in the first half of 2020, describing
different strategies used to improve hospitals’ resilience, particularly in terms of 1) planning,
management, and security, and 2) human resources. Research focuses mainly on interventions

related to healthcare workers’ well-being and mental health, protection protocols, space
reorganization, personal protective equipment and resources management, work organization,
training, e-health and the use of technologies. Hospital financing, information and
communication, and governance were less represented in the literature.

Conclusion: The selected literature was dominated by quantitative descriptive case studies,
sometimes lacking consideration of methodological limitations. The review revealed a lack of
holistic research attempting to unite the topics within a resilience framework. Research on
hospitals resilience would benefit from a greater range of analysis to draw more nuanced and
contextualized lessons from the multiple specific responses to the crisis. We identified key
strategies on how hospitals maintained their resilience when confronted with the COVID-19
pandemic and a range of recommendations for practice.

INTRODUCTION

Since the end of 2019, the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19 has put health systems
across the globe under severe strain [1]. The COVID-19 is rapidly evolving, and its many
unknowns have made the response efforts difficult and variable, challenging effective
decision-making in a context of uncertainty [2], [3]. National responses have varied greatly,
with some countries being more successful (i.e., better prepared, or better able to cope with
the pandemic) than others in containing the transmission and preventing deaths. In other
words, some health systems have been more resilient to the shock of the pandemic [4].

Hospitals play a critical role within health systems in providing essential medical care to the
community, particularly during a crisis [5]. They are complex and vulnerable institutions,
dependent on crucial external support and supply lines [6]. Many of them frequently operate
at near-surge capacity under normal working conditions, and a rise in admission volume, even
modest, can overwhelm them beyond their functional reserve [5], [7]. The current outbreak of
COVID-19 has caused numerous hospitals’ disruptions such as shortages of critical

equipment and supplies [8], [9], significant risks of infection among patients or healthcare
workers (HCWs) [10], [11], high hospitalization rates and lengths of stay [12], and high
workloads for HCWs that are often linked to psychological adverse effects [13], [14]. All
those disruptions can have a direct impact on healthcare delivery by limiting access to needed
care, creating panic and potentially jeopardizing established working routines [5].

Understanding health systems resilience has never been more essential than today [15].
Resilience refers to “the capacities of dimensions/components of a health system faced with
shocks, challenges/stress or destabilizing chronic tensions (unexpected or expected, sudden or
insidious, internal or external to the system), to absorb, adapt and/or transform in order to
maintain and/or improve access (for all) to comprehensive, relevant and quality health care
and services without pushing patients into poverty” [16], [17]. To our knowledge, despite a
growing interest in the concept of resilience, little work has explored how it has been
operationalized in empirical studies [18]. Except for a few studies focusing on HCWs’ mental
health and their personal resilience, there has been no attempt to systematically summarize the
evidence on improving and maintaining hospitals resilience generated from the COVID-19
outbreak.

Moreover, in a context of a public health emergency, research and action co-evolve and are
conducted at the same time. In the context of COVID-19, the scale of scientific production
has been astonishing and, while essential, it can be overwhelming and counterproductive [19].
It is necessary to find effective ways to share methodological sound information between
countries and stakeholders during this crisis management.

This paper aims to report the main strategies implemented by hospitals and their staff to face
the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. It is not intended to be exhaustive, but its overall
purpose is to offer evidence on best practices and lessons learned from hospitals’ experiences
to guide health decision makers and professionals to design adapted and efficient responses to
cope with similar shocks in the future [20].

METHODS

As part of a multi-country analysis [21], we conducted a scoping review, based on the highly
empirical scientific literature published in the first half of 2020. A scoping review was
preferred to a full systematic review as it allowed us to synthesize, from a very broad search,
with rigor and in a relatively short period of time, the state of knowledge on a specific
research question and to identify and analyze gaps in the knowledge base to inform public
decision makers, stakeholders, and researchers [22], [23].

The methods of data selection and analysis have been detailed in an online protocol [24].
Although not always applicable, we referred to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist [25].

Identification of articles

We conducted our searches on a collection of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic
published on the Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library website. These articles were collected on
the following electronic databases : Medline (Ovid and PubMed), PubMed Central, Embase,
CAB Abstracts, Global Health, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Academic Search
Complete, Africa Wide Information, CINAHL, ProQuest Central, SciFinder, the Virtual
Health Library, LitCovid, WHO COVID-19 website, CDC COVID-19 website, China CDC
Weekly, Eurosurveillance, Homeland Security Digital Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, bioRxiv
(preprints), medRxiv (preprints), chemRxiv (preprints), and SSRN (preprints). We
downloaded, from April to June 2020, all the references added to the CDC database. The first
references added to the database were published in December 2019.

Selection of studies

After downloading downloaded all the references from the CDC database (n = 58160), we
imported them on Zotero, a reference management software, to make a first sorting with an
English request (Table 1). Requests in French and Spanish proved not to be relevant or
effective.

All the references selected on Zotero (n = 13173) have been classified by the Automated Text
Classifier of Empirical Research (ATCER) tool. The ATCER tool distinguishes (a) empirical
studies (with an empirical degree ≥ 50), based on qualitative, quantitative, and mixed
methods, from (b) non-empirical work (with an empirical degree < 50) (e.g., commentaries,
editorials, literature reviews, professional guidelines etc.) [26]. Because of the large number
of data, we selected an ATCER threshold of 90 to reflect articles that were judged as “highly
empirical” by the tool (i.e., with an empirical degree ≥ 90). Grey literature and prepublications were excluded from our research.

To be included in the review, the references had to meet the following criteria: (a) published
between December 2019 (the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic) and June 2020; (b)

written in English; (c) assessed as “highly empirical” by the ATCER tool (i.e., with an
empirical degree ≥ 90); (d) available and accessible in full-text; (e) focused on the resilience
of hospitals and their staff to the COVID-19 pandemic.

After the ATCER tool analysis and the removal of duplicates, we imported the selected
references (n = 559) into Covidence, a systematic review software for screening. Covidence
automatically removed 1 duplicate. Two reviewers (LT, IM) independently assessed the
relevance of titles and abstracts based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In case of
disagreement between the two reviewers, a third reviewer (JS) made a final decision. At this
stage, 411 references were excluded. Reasons for exclusion are detailed in the PRISMA flow
diagram (Figure 1). Then, at least two of five involved reviewers (LT, JS, AC, KP, AA)
independently assessed the full text relevance of the selected articles. After a common vote,
they agreed to exclude 82 references. We finally included 65 references in the review.

Data extraction and quality assessment

One author (LT) extracted data from the selected studies (n = 65) on MAXQDA® 2020, a
software package for qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods research.

A data extracting form was created on Excel to collect several information from the selected
literature: publication type, study type, study settings – continent and hospital settings –,
hospital dimension(s), objectives, results and limitations of the study, and conceptual
framework or mid-range theory used (Table S1: Description of the selected studies).

Information related to quality assessment of the studies with the Mixed-Methods Appraisal
Tool (MMAT) were reported in (Figure 3).

Data synthesis and analysis: the conceptual approach

To synthetize data and write the review, we used a conceptual framework on health systems’
resilience designed by Ridde and al. [21].

The framework shows the association between: (a) the effects, positive or negative, caused by
the pandemic; (b) the strategies implemented to deal with these effects; and (c) the impacts,
positive or negative, of these strategies on the hospital's organizational routines.

From a resilience perspective, these “Effects – Strategies – Impacts'' processes can give rise to
three types of configuration that could be named as: (a) reaction (i.e., an effect is felt, a
strategy is adopted, and this strategy has an impact), (b) anticipation (i.e., strategies/impacts,
before any effects), and (c) inaction (i.e., effects but no strategies). These processes are
nonlinear and the impact of one strategy can, for example, lead to the implementation of a
new strategy. We do not make any judgements about the nature of the causality of the impacts
and the evaluations that provide evidence for them. Thus, we only describe the impacts of the
strategies as proposed by the authors, and we will report any methodological limitations in the
Discussion section.

We adapted the 10 dimensions of health systems resilience [27] to analyze hospitals and
professionals’ resilience to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we chose to focus on the 5
following dimensions: 1) governance; 2) human resources; 3) finance; 4) planning,
management, and security; 5) information and communication.

RESULTS

We selected 65 articles for inclusion in the review (Figure 1). We mapped the distribution of
the selected studies by publication type, study type, continent/country of the study, hospital
settings, hospital dimension(s) and the use of conceptual frameworks or mid-range theories
(Table S1: Description of the selected studies).

Our analysis revealed that 95.4% (n = 62) of the articles were identified as peer-reviewed
articles. The three other studies were peer-reviewed short or case reports. The studies were
dominated by descriptive quantitative studies (n = 40; 61.5%) and case studies, with single
case studies (n = 18; 27.7%) and multiple-case studies (n = 5; 7.7%) using both quantitative (n
= 19; 29.2%) or mixed methods (n = 4; 6.1%). There were only 1 randomized study (1.5%),
and 1 qualitative study (1.5%).

The geographical distribution of the selected studies is described in (Figure 2). The studies
were conducted in Asia (n = 35; 53.8%) with most studies conducted in China (n = 22;
33.8%), in Europe (n = 12; 18.5%) with most studies conducted in Italy (n = 4; 6.1%) and
Spain (n = 3; 4.6%), in North America (n = 8; 12.3%), in Latin America (n = 2; 3%), and in
Oceania (n = 2; 3%). The remaining studies (n = 5; 7.7%) were conducted in multiple
countries. Location was not mentioned for one study.

Figure 2: Geographic distribution of identified studies

Most of the studies focused on hospital settings (n = 33; 50.8%), with 12 studies focusing on
tertiary hospitals (18.5%), or on both public and private practice settings (n = 12; 18.5%).

Several studies focused on specific departments or units (n = 27; 41.5%), and mostly on
emergency or infectious departments (n = 13; 20%).

In the selected studies, hospital dimensions were referred to at the following frequency (some
studies focused on more than one dimension): 1) planning, management, and security (n =
77), with most studies focusing on protection protocols (n = 24); 2) human resources (n = 58)
with most studies focusing on professionals’ well-being and mental health (n = 32); 3)
information and communication (n = 7); and 4) finance (n = 4). No article specifically focused
on the “governance” dimension (i.e., on hospitals’ leadership decisions) but we found some
elements concerning governance in studies that focused on the 4 other dimensions.

We applied the MMAT to report quality assessment of the studies (Figure 3). Almost all
studies had clear described research questions or objectives. Sampling methods or techniques
were clearly mentioned in 8 studies (12.3%). Representation of the population under study
seems to have been well addressed in most of the studies, but we found a high representation
of female respondents in some studies (n = 20; 30.8%), and a high representation of male
respondents in some other studies (n = 7; 10.8%). Appropriate measurement was captured
well in almost all the studies, except for 5 of them in which it was not mentioned (7.7%).
Response rate was clearly reported in only 9 studies (13.8%) and 52 articles explicitly
mentioned limitations of the intervention or of the study methodology (80%).

Only 1 study [28] used a conceptual framework to further analyze data.

In the following synthesis, we reported the main “Effects – Strategies – Impacts” processes
that appeared in the selected articles to study hospitals’ resilience.

1. Hospital dimension: Planning, management, and security

1.1 Protection protocols

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

The COVID-19 pandemic has urged hospitals to develop and put in place new protocols to
preserve the safety of patients and professionals [29]–[32]. Several studies show the high
prevalence of infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) that may probably have been
infected in their working environment in hospitals [33]. However, safety protocols are not
always available in medical institutions receiving COVID-19 patients [9].

Strategies implemented to address these effects:
•

Instituting standard pre-triage and testing protocols. A large tertiary referral center in
Northern Italy implemented an out-of-hospital pre-triage to identify suspected SARSCoV-2 infections [34]. Phone pre-triage was also tested in nuclear medicine (NM)
departments for patients with COVID-19 or suspected symptoms (e.g., cough, fever) [35].
The otolaryngology department of the Rush University Medical Center, a tertiary medical
center in Chicago, designed and implemented two preoperative COVID-19 testing
protocols for all patients undergoing a surgical procedure: a “high risk case protocol”
performed two days prior to surgery, and a “universal point-of-car (POC) testing protocol”
performed on the day of surgery [36]. Another study led in Australia proposed selfcollection of nasal and throat swabs (i.e., done by the patients themselves) as a reliable
alternative to HCWs’ collection [37].

•

Using algorithms to facilitate patients’ prioritization. In California, a department of
surgery of the Stanford University Medical Center created a decision tree algorithm
describing institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members. The
algorithm is based on urgency of operation (disease severity), anticipated viral burden at
the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize the virus, and patients’ testing
status and symptomatology [38]. The University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital
implemented a scoring system algorithm for Medically Necessary, Time-Sensitive
(MeNTS) procedures, to facilitate case prioritization by incorporating procedure, disease,
and patient factors into the decision-making process (e.g., risks of exposing HCWs to
potential viral transmission, consumption of scarce medical resources etc.) [39].

•

Encouraging HCWs and patients to follow strict hygienic protective measures within
hospitals. Professionals and patients were asked to wear adequate personal protective
equipment (PPE) (hospital scrubs and footwear for HCWs, and surgical masks for HCWs
and patients), and to wash and disinfect their hands [29], [31], [34]. Hospitals were also
required to disinfect common work surfaces [29], [40] or to ventilate rooms after each
visit [31].

•

Avoiding contact between professionals and between HCWs and patients. Some hospitals
in Europe and North America suspended, cancelled, or held online clinical sessions and
academic committee meetings and conferences [29], [40]. Other hospitals decided to
reduce the number of HCWs in rooms hosting suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19
cases [41], or imposed HCWs to complete patients’ medical records once patients have
left the room to shorten exposure time [31]. In a study led in Poland, the rule of “one lab,
one desk, one telephone” for medical staff was implemented [31].

•

Regulating or restricting family visits. Two European hospitals prohibited visits from the
relatives of patients [31], [32]. In Taiwan, a large study which analyzed the new visiting
policies of 472 hospitals in Taiwan concluded that 276 hospitals posted new visiting
policies on their websites. Visits to regular wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals and,
among the 193 hospitals that still allowed visits to regular wards, 141 restricted visitors to
two at a time and 106 restricted visits to two visiting periods per day [42]. Among these
policies, recording patient details regarding recent travel, occupation, and contacts

information was mentioned by 159 websites, body temperature monitoring by 151, and
hand hygiene by 122.
•

Implementing contact tracing of HCWs. In Italy, the University Hospital of Bari
implemented a reporting system to record all close contacts of HCWs by a “COVID-19
Control Room” which requests suspected and confirmed HCWs cases to be placed in
home isolation and ordains all people who had contact with involved HCWs to do
domiciliary nasopharyngeal swabs [41].

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

According to the authors of the studies [36]–[39], [41], the reported strategies helped to
prevent HCWs and patients from being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The decision tree
algorithm and the MeNTS scoring tool are considered as safe, efficient, valuable, and easy to
implement tools to ration PPE, and to ensure optimal HCWs’ safety [38]. The two
preoperative COVID-19 testing protocols were implemented rapidly and seem to have
protected HCWs and patients from potential operative and perioperative COVID-19
exposures [36]. Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs were determined to be easy to
perform and highly acceptable by the patients themselves, while providing patients with easier
access to testing, increased the safety for both patients and staff by reducing mutual exposure
and reduced the requirement for PPE [37].

1.2. Space reorganization

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

Since the beginning of the crisis, some hospitals have been quickly converted to COVID-19
care centers and some departments closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 [32],
[35]. This often resulted in frequent reorganization of physical space.

Strategies implemented to address these effects:

•

Creating dedicated high-risk COVID-19 areas. In Singapore and Italy, some hospitals
partitioned their emergency departments (ED) into “higher risk” and “lower-risk” areas
with dedicated staff and equipment and set up specific traffic flows for HCWs and
patients [34], [43].

•

Undertaking infrastructural modifications to accommodate the increasing number of
COVID-19 cases. A study led in Singapore mentions the introduction of a respiratory
surveillance ward (RSW) to facilitate the triage of patients presenting with respiratory
syndromes [7]. An orthopedic center in Italy also quickly set up a dedicated COVID-19
operating room with reserved beds to isolate COVID-19 patients and provide HCWs with
high-level PPE [32]. In Portugal, some emergency departments used alternative areas,
such as tents or drive-in stations, for testing [44].

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

These strategies have been judged as having positive impacts by limiting COVID-19
transmission within hospitals and protecting both patients and HCWs. In the Singapore
General Hospital, since the division of the ED in high-risk “fever areas” and lower-risk zones,
no cases of nosocomial transmission from intra-ED exposure were observed [43]. And the
RSW has been successful in containing patients with COVID-19 in designated areas where
appropriate PPE and infrastructural enhancements could reduce nosocomial transmission [7].

1.3. Personal protective equipment and resources management

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

The use of appropriate PPE by both professionals and patients is essential in minimizing
nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [7], [43], [45]. A single case of COVID-19 can
result in the quarantine of large numbers of patients or HCWs, further straining hospital
resources [7]. However, basic PPE was not always available in many medical institutions
dealing with COVID-19 patients [8], [9], [33], [45]–[52]. These shortages can lead to the reuse or the inappropriate use of PPE by HCWs [33], [47], higher risk of infection and level of
anxiety among HCWs [33], [51], [52], and physical injuries [46], [53].

Strategies implemented to address these effects:
•

Applying a risk-stratified approach to rationally conserve PPE and avoid infection. A
large tertiary hospital in Singapore divided its ED in different zones: higher risk zones, or
“fever areas”, in which all patients presenting to the ED with a respiratory syndrome or
undifferentiated fever were classified and where HCWs had to use full PPE (i.e., N95
masks, eye protection or face shields, disposable gown and gloves); lower risk zones (e.g.,
triage areas, corridors of fever areas, observation ward, and critical care area) where ED
staff wore N95 masks; and other low-risk areas where the usage of a surgical mask was
made the mandatory minimum standard [43]. In California, the department of surgery of
the Stanford University Medical Center developed an algorithm for PPE use by requiring
a fitted N95 respirator mask in addition to droplet PPE (i.e., gown, gloves, eye protection)
for the entire team managing emergency cases or COVID+ patients, and droplet PPE for
all cleaning personnel [38].

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

According to the authors, the “risk-stratified” approach has proven to ensure HCWs’ safety
and a rational use of PPE in a resource-constrained setting. Managing all patients presenting
with respiratory syndromes in designated fever areas with upgraded PPE and better bed
spacing of patients prevented patient-to-staff transmission during the pandemic [43].

1.4. E-health and the use of technologies

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

Since the beginning of the pandemic, a radical increase in the use of e-health has been
reported [30], [31], [40], [54], [55]. Telemedicine has proven to be an effective way to
increase and expand patients’ access to care over a short period of time [55], decrease
interpersonal contact [31], avoid overwhelming burdens on healthcare facilities [31], and
provide care at times of shortages in human resources or equipment [55]. It has shown high
rates of satisfaction among both patients and clinicians [30], [55], [56]. However, there are

some limitations: it is still not widely available for all HCWs [9], professionals have not
always been trained on how to perform effective teleconsultations [40], there are financial
barriers such as the lack of reimbursement for most telemedical procedures [31], and patients
must have access to an internet connection and be comfortable with the use of technologies
[31], [57].

Strategies implemented to address these effects:
•

Implementing telephone follow-up and teleconsultation with electronic medical records.
In India, a multi-tier ophthalmology hospital network set up a three-level triage protocol
of teleconsultation calls with a dedicated teleconsult team of ophthalmologists, using the
patient information retrieved from the electronic medical record (EMR) system [54]. In
Poland, at the ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACID) of the Central Teaching
Hospital, physicians phoned and interviewed patients about their health prior to planned
visits and made further treatment decisions based on the interview and available EMR
[31].

•

Using a virtual care program to manage outpatients with COVID-19. In Toronto, the
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre developed the COVID-19 Expansion to Outpatients
(COVIDEO) program to provide ongoing care for outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19,
and to follow and assess them via the Ontario Telemedicine Network virtual care platform
or by telephone [57].

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

Teleconsultations and access to patient information from EMR enabled a timely response, by
handling a large volume of calls efficiently and ensuring continuity of care in the absence of
physical visits to the hospital and information access to the patients [54]. The use of EMR has
been judged as paramount given the importance of immediate access to information about the
patient [31], [54]. In both studies, most patients gave positive feedback on teleconsultations.
The COVIDEO program allowed HCWs to plan for a safe and controlled hospital transfer for
those showing signs of clinical deterioration, but the authors identified several
implementation challenges including increased number of patients, administrative challenges

of booking virtual visits, and the fact that older people may not be as comfortable using
technologies [57].

2. Hospital dimension: Human resources

2.1. Reorganization of professionals’ work

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

The COVID-19 pandemic has demanded increased focus on resource allocation and on the
roles in which HCWs function [48]. Several physicians reported working outside of their
normal scope of practice [48]. Heavy workloads impacted their work quality [8], induced
stress and high risks of infection [8], [12], [48], [58], [59]. The contamination of HCWs
resulted in a reduced workforce available for daily activities, coverage for on-call duties, and
a general weakening of the response capacity [29], [60].

Strategies implemented to address these effects:
•

Redeploying HCWs and recruiting new workforce. A study led in different US urology
departments documented how several specialists’ physicians were redeployed to “frontline
COVID-19 services”, most commonly to ICUs and emergency departments [40]. Also,
due to the drastic surge of patients worldwide, reinforcements strategies have been
implemented in Europe, Asia and North America [8], [40], [59], [61]–[63]. Many
countries involved students or physicians in training to join the workforce, largely
regardless of their specialization [8], [62].

•

Implementing specific measures to reorganize HCWs’ work. In Italy, the Operative Unit
of Occupational Medicine of the University Hospital of Bari made changes in HCWs’
work to avoid overcrowding or infection risks, such as reducing the number of HCWs in
rooms with suspected and/or confirmed COVID-19 cases, organizing necessary bedside
medical and surgical procedures in advance, and performing nasopharyngeal swabs by a
single HCW per work shift [41].

17

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.22.21255908; this version posted April 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

According to the authors of the studies, these strategies helped to face the sudden surge of
COVID-19 patients and to alleviate HCWs’ work. However, mandatory redeployments can
impact HCWs’ motivation [40], and inexperience in such urgent situations may be
particularly stressful for students graduating directly to responsibilities during the pandemic
crisis [62]. Both can impact HCWs’ work quality.

2.2. Knowledge and training of HCWs

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

Some studies show the moderate-to-poor or the inadequate level of knowledge of HCWs
about the COVID-19 pandemic or its management [47], [49]. Poor level of knowledge can be
due to limited training [8], [14], [46], [64], or can be explained by misinformation due to the
use of social media [47]. This can result in dissatisfaction among HCWs [46], higher levels of
stress and anxiety [8], [14], and incorrect or irrelevant practices leading to higher risks of
infection for HCWs [60]. HCWs want to be better prepared for emergencies [28], [49], and
gain confidence in their role in reducing the risk of transmission [60].

Strategies implemented to address these effects:
•

Providing and facilitating online training for HCWs. Two studies, led in Denmark and in
China, analyzed the differences between “traditional teaching” (i.e., instructor-led
training) and video training in their effectiveness to handle training disruptions during the
pandemic [65], [66]. In both strategies, the group of participants who watched training
videos could freely watch again at home.

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

The strategy enabled HCWs to access training, and information during the COVID-19
pandemic. The studies found no significant difference between the two types of training. The
participants who received video training were on average as competent as those who received
18

instructor-led training in-person. HCWs show high satisfaction with the use of video training
[65] that has proven to be a resource-efficient way of reaching all relevant personnel without
requiring face-to-face training [66], both in terms of time and money spent.

2.3. Well-being and mental health of HCWs

Effects of the pandemic on hospitals’ professionals:

Several studies found a high prevalence of sleep disorders, stress, anxiety, and depression
among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic [12], [28], [33], [48], [52], [59], [61], [63],
[67]–[72], for which students [8], [13], [56], [62], doctors [60], [70], non-frontline HCWs
[73], and female HCWs [45], [63], [69], [74], [75] were greater risks to experience.
Psychological distress and anxiety can be caused by: the fear of being infected and
contaminating their families [8], [14], [29], [48], [58], [60], [64], [76]–[78]; the lack of
knowledge and unavailability of clear protocols [28], [45], [58]; shortages of medical supplies
and effective PPE [13], [14], [33], [40], [45], [52], [58], [63]; heavy workloads [13], [14],
[28], [59], [60], [68], [78]; the disruption of training programs [14]; quarantine measures and
isolation [56]; the overwhelming quantity of information in the media, including social media
[62], [77]; concerns about their financial situation, mostly for surgeons because of the
reduction of surgical and clinical activities [56]. Some studies reported measures considered
to be effective in reducing HCWs’ anxiety: institutional support and recognition of their work
by the medical profession and hospital management [58]; family or social support [13], [40],
[58], [59], [62]; better virus prevention and transmission knowledge [58]; implementation of
clear disease prevention guidelines [58]; a positive working environment (e.g., colleagues
encouraging each other during work shifts, writing good-luck messages on personal protective
equipment, enjoying lunches provided by social volunteers, communicating with others on
social media…) [28], [33], [58].

Strategies implemented to address these effects:
•

Providing HCWs with institutional or family psychological support. A study from China
reported the use of intervention teams to provide psychological services to HCWs [74]. Of
all the participants of the study, 36.3% accessed psychological materials (e.g., brochures,
19

books), 50.4% psychological resources available through media (e.g., online push
messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% participated in
counseling or psychotherapy.
•

Setting up a collaborative and helping crisis cell for HCWs in need. In France, a crisis cell
was created for all residents of the French Association of Urologists in Training (AFUF)
in need, to connect physicians in training with psychiatry residents 24 hours a day [8].

•

Improving information dissemination. In China, the Second Affiliated Hospital of
Guangxi Medical University provided access to various online platforms with medical
advice to share information on how to decrease the transmission risks between patients
[68].

•

Enhancing HCWs’ personal resilience. An international study focusing on COVID-19
impacts on spine surgeons worldwide provided examples of coping strategies
implemented by HCWs themselves, such as spending time with family, physical activity,
reading, and practicing meditation or spiritual/religious activities [48].

Impacts of these strategies (when mentioned):

The studies demonstrated the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs’ wellbeing and mental health without reporting the impacts of the strategies implemented.

3. Hospital dimension: Information and communication

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

In moments of public health crisis, communication “is as crucial as medical intervention”
[79]. The quantity of information sources and the rapid evolution of the pandemic has made it
difficult to distinguish misinformation from valid information. This has resulted in enormous
implications from delaying appropriate care to a disregard for evidence-based interventions
[79]. Data shared online, particularly through social networks, can cause considerable
information pollution [45], [47], [64], [79]. However, a study led in India demonstrated that
20

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.22.21255908; this version posted April 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

social media could play an important role in information dissemination during emergencies
and lead to concrete behavioral changes [79].

No strategies or impacts related to information and communication practices have been found
in the selected literature.

4. Hospital dimension: Finance

Effects of the pandemic on hospital organizational routines:

The COVID-19 crisis has put a massive burden on healthcare systems [77]. Since its
beginning, there has been a shift of attention and resources from entire healthcare systems to
focus solely on the COVID-19 response. However, this certainly implies opportunity costs of
not solving health problems that should have been resolved during this period [44]. The
cancellation or postponement of medical and surgical procedures leads to the accumulation of
unmet or unresolved needs, to the rise of complexity and severity of some pathologies, and to
increased health and economic risks.

No strategies or impacts related to hospitals’ financing have been found in the selected
literature.

DISCUSSION

Main findings

Hospital dimensions and gaps in the literature
In the selected studies, almost all the attention was focused on the two following hospital
dimensions: 1) “human resources”, including HCWs’ well-being and mental health, work
reorganization, and HCWs’ knowledge and training; and 2) “planning, management and
security”, including protection protocols for patients and professionals’ safety, space
reorganization, PPE and resources management, and e-health and the use of technologies. The
“information and communication”, “finance” and “governance” dimensions were mentioned
21

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.22.21255908; this version posted April 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

in a small number of studies and often lacked rigorous analysis. Some studies also focused on
HCWs’ professional values (i.e., values that are particularly important for HCWs and
encourage them to work), part of the health systems’ “software” dimension [80]. These
studies, mainly conducted in China, focused on the Chinese workforce, and referred to
specific vocabulary and expectations. Chinese HCWs are expected to “exude a sense of
responsibility and collective action” in the fight against the epidemic [68]. Their “willingness”
to practice during the crisis is even higher than in previous outbreaks [61], their “social and
moral responsibilities and professional obligations” being the most important factors that
motivate them to continue working during the COVID-19 outbreak [58].
Most of the studies were directly written by HCWs working in different hospital settings
during the pandemic. Participation by HCWs in the process of knowledge creation can be an
invaluable tool, by enabling the creation of a “collective space for health professionals to
reflect on and improve their practices” [81]. However, this process could also represent a
scientific bias that can bring into question the neutrality of the scientific research process.
There were limitations in the selected studies. Firstly, we found that only one study used a
conceptual framework to further analyze its data. Research is not sufficiently supported by
theories and analytical frameworks [82], even though their a priori or a posteriori use could
allow researchers to comprehensively assess the complex and dynamic process of healthcare
access [83], [84]. Secondly, inequalities were ignored. The term “inequalities” was only used
once in the selected studies, reflecting the more global lack of consideration of inequalities in
the design of public health interventions during a crisis period [85]. Almost all the articles
about hospitals’ professionals were focused on nurses, doctors, or specialist practitioners (e.g.,
surgeons), neglecting other professions such as paramedics, caregivers, or administrative
professionals. Similarly, gender differences were rarely discussed in the selected studies. It
suggests a “gender blindness”, the systemic failure to acknowledge gender differences in
health [86], [87].

Hospitals’ resilience outcomes and processes
The selected studies were more descriptive in nature and all the reported impacts of the
strategies were positive. We found more observations than specific strategies evaluated, with
only a few studies performing any kind of systematic analysis to assess the impacts of these
strategies. In the COVID-19 context, the rapidly evolving situation made it difficult to
22

evaluate the impacts of recently implemented strategies or interventions. The goal of most of
the included studies was to share knowledge as quickly as possible, but the lack of rigorous
analyses is problematic [88] and does not allow the identification of which strategies are
effective.
Few studies referred to actions taken in anticipation of the pandemic (strategies/impacts,
before any effects) with most having reported cases of “inaction” (effects without any
strategies). Most of the articles highlighted how some processes undertaken during the
pandemic led to absorptive processes, healthcare facilities trying to absorb the shock by
implementing short-term measures. For example, the creation of a crisis cell for French
urologist residents or the use of specific algorithms (e.g., algorithms to facilitate patients’
prioritization or to rationally use PPE), in different countries, seem to be temporary measures
that may not lead to global transformative processes. However, several articles attempted to
increase healthcare access in ways that could potentially lead to a positive transformation
process. For example, articles focusing on e-health mentioned that the current experience of
tele-medicine, with the implementation of tele-consultations and the use of electronic medical
records, could provide valuable insights to the possibility of managing patient follow-up visits
remotely in the future [54]. Further research is needed to examine whether these resilience
processes have led to improved access to healthcare in hospitals following the pandemic.

Implications for professionals

The authors of the selected studies gave recommendations for practice to HCWs and
hospitals’ leaders. An overview of these recommendations is depicted in (Table S2:
Recommendations). We found more recommendations than specific strategies in the studies,
which need to be taken with caution given the lack of evaluation in terms of their
effectiveness.
During the COVID-19 pandemic management, obstacles encountered by hospitals and their
personnel may or may not have been overcome for various reasons. The current pandemic
provides important opportunities to propose high-quality lessons [89] learned from both
positive and negative experiences. This work is essential to guide professionals’ practices,
especially with the arrival of future waves of the pandemic.

Implications for research
This scoping review highlights the need for more rigorous intervention research and
evaluation, and the inclusion of multi-disciplinary teams involving social science researchers
and epidemiologists [90]. A structured research agenda to inform health policy and system
responses to COVID-19 should include hospital resilience research [91]. The sharing of highquality lessons learned is crucial to designing appropriate policies to contain the COVID-19
pandemic.

Limitations of the study

Firstly, as we chose to conduct a scoping review, the simplification of some steps of the
systematic review to speed up the process can influence its rigor. To make these risks explicit
and allow transparency, we gave a very detailed description of the method. Secondly, because
of the very large amount of data available, we decided to exclude grey literature and preprints
from our searches, therefore we could also have missed pertinent studies. Thirdly, we faced
the analytical challenge of causality, for epistemological and methodological reasons. The
first reason is the use, essentially, of a qualitative approach, and the second reason is the
pandemic context, which did not facilitate a longitudinal data collection.

CONCLUSION
There is a wide range of studies related to hospitals’ resilience that help us to understand
which strategies have been implemented to face the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical
scientific literature can provide important lessons on protection protocols, space
reorganization, PPE and resources management, e-health and the use of technology, work
organization, training, HCWs’ well-being and mental health, information and communication,
governance, and finance. However, data must be updated regularly to report the evolutions of
the strategies implemented, and to provide health decision makers and professionals with
recent and relevant lessons learned from concrete hospitals’ experiences to help them to better
tackle new COVID-19 waves or future outbreaks. Further research on healthcare access is
also needed to study the global resilience of hospitals.
