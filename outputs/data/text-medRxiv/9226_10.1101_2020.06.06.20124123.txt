Key points: Six molecular diagnostic tests showed equivalent and sufficient sensitivity in

31

clinical use in diagnosing COVID-19 in self-collected saliva samples. However, a rapid

32

SARS-CoV-2 antigen test alone is not recommended for use without further study.

Abstract

35

Background: The clinical performance of six molecular diagnostic tests and a rapid antigen

36

test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were clinically

37

evaluated for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in self-collected saliva.

38

Methods: Saliva samples from 103 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (15

39

asymptomatic and 88 symptomatic) were collected on the day of hospital admission.

40

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva was detected using a quantitative reverse-transcription

41

polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) laboratory-developed test (LDT), a cobas

42

SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, three direct RT-qPCR kits, and reverse-transcription

43

loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Viral antigen was detected by a rapid

44

antigen immunochromatographic assay.

45

Results: Of the 103 samples, viral RNA was detected in 50.5–81.6% of the specimens by

46

molecular diagnostic tests and an antigen was detected in 11.7% of the specimens by the

47

rapid antigen test. Viral RNA was detected at a significantly higher percentage (65.6–93.4%)

48

in specimens collected within 9 d of symptom onset compared to that of specimens collected

49

after at least 10 d of symptom onset (22.2–66.7%) and that of asymptomatic patients

50

(40.0–66.7%). Viral RNA was more frequently detected in saliva from males than females.

Conclusions: Self-collected saliva is an alternative specimen diagnosing COVID-19. LDT

52

RT-qPCR, cobas SARS-CoV-2 high-throughput system, direct RT-qPCR except for one

53

commercial kit, and RT-LAMP showed sufficient sensitivity in clinical use to be selectively

54

used according to clinical settings and facilities. The rapid antigen test alone is not

55

recommended for initial COVID-19 diagnosis because of its low sensitivity.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory

59

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported in 2019, in Wuhan, China, and the

60

World Health Organization subsequently declared it a pandemic [1, 2]. The large number of

61

patients with COVID-19 during outbreaks is overwhelming the capacity of national health

62

care systems; therefore, the quick and accurate identification of patients requiring supportive

63

therapies and isolation is important for the management of COVID-19.

64

The quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay for

65

SARS-CoV-2 using upper and lower respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal swab,

66

throat swab, and sputum) is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 [3]. Laboratory

67

developed tests (LDT) including RT-qPCR, a high-throughput RT-qPCR system (fully

68

automated from RNA extraction to reporting of results without the need for highly skilled

69

laboratory technicians), and direct rapid RNA extraction-free RT-qPCR kits (using a modified

70

RT-qPCR master mix), have been widely used worldwide [4]. Other molecular diagnostic

71

methods such as reverse-transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)

72

have also been reported as useful for diagnosing COVID-19 in point-of care testing [5, 6].

73

Recently, a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (RAT) (ESPLINE® SARS-CoV-2; Fuji Rebio

74

Inc., Tokyo, Japan), which combines immunochromatography with an enzyme immunoassay

75

to detect the viral nucleocapsid protein, has been approved by the Japanese government [7].

76

The RAT is beginning to be used for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical settings because it

77

does not require special equipment, it does not have a time-consuming protocol, and highly

78

skilled laboratory technicians are not essential. Although these diagnostic tests are useful in

79

the identification of patients with COVID-19, the process of collecting upper and lower

80

respiratory tract specimens increases the risk of exposure to viral droplets and there is a

81

patient burden [8]. Therefore, an alternative specimen, which can be self-collected, to

82

diagnose COVID-19 is desirable for the clinical management of COVID-19 during this

83

pandemic era [8].

84

The sensitivity of RT-qPCR on upper respiratory specimens has been reported lower

85

(32% for pharyngeal swab, and 63% for nasopharyngeal swabs) than lower respiratory

86

specimens (72% for sputum, and 93% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) [9]. Recently, several

87

reports highlighted the clinical usefulness of RT-qPCR analysis of saliva specimens [10-15].

88

Saliva specimens can be easily collected by the patients themselves by spitting into a

89

collection tube; thus, using saliva specimens can reduce the burden on a patient, reduce the

90

risk of exposure to viral droplets for medical workers, and reduce the time and cost of the

91

testing procedure [16]. However, the clinical usefulness of saliva specimens for diagnosing

92

COVID-19 remains controversial because the diagnostic sensitivity also vary widely between

93

69.2 and 100% for COVID-19, and it has yet to be thoroughly evaluated due to the small

94

sample size and lack of detailed clinical information [10-15, 17].

Materials and methods

101

Patients and sample collection

102

Patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study after being referred to the

103

Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan for isolation and treatment under the Infectious

104

Disease Control Law in effect from Feb 11 to May 13, 2020. All patients were examined for

105

the SARS-CoV-2 virus by RT-qPCR using pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected at

106

public health institutes or hospitals in accordance with the nationally recommended method

107

in Japan [18]. On the day of admission, saliva specimens (~500 μL) were self-collected by all

108

patients by spitting into a sterile tube. All samples were stored at -80 °C until sample

109

preparation. All sample preparation and sample analysis were conducted by SRL, Inc. (Tokyo,

110

Japan).

centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was used in the following

115

molecular diagnostic and RAT.

116

Detection of viral RNA by LDT RT-qPCR using the standard protocol

117

LDT RT-qPCR was performed according to the National Institution Infections Diseases

118

(NIID) protocol which is nationally recommended for SARS-CoV-2 detection in Japan [18].

119

Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL saliva specimens using a QIAsymphony™ RNA Kit

120

(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR

121

amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein gene was performed using the

122

QuantiTect®Probe RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) with the following sets of primers and probe. N-1

133

Corporation, Kyoto, Japan); and Method C, SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit (Toyobo, Osaka,

134

Japan) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The kits B and C were used with the

135

same primer sets as used in the LDT RT-qPCR method. The kit A was used with the primer

136

sets recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [20]. Processed

137

saliva specimens were directly added to the RT-qPCR master mix and then to thermal cycling,

138

directly. Methods A and C are quantitative, whereas method B is qualitative.

139

Detection of viral RNA by automated RT-qPCR device

140

The cobas SARS-CoV-2 test (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) [7, 21] was performed on the

141

RT-qPCR automated cobas 8800 system (Roche) [4]. Specimens (600 μL) were loaded onto

142

the cobas 8800 with cobas SARS-CoV-2 master mix containing an internal RNA control,

143

primers, and probes targeting the specific SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame (ORF) 1 gene

144

(target 1) and envelope (E) gene (target 2). A cobas 8800 positive result for the presence of

145

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was defined as “detected” if targets 1 and 2 were detected or

146

“presumptive positive” if target 1 was not detected but target 2 was detected.

147

Detection of viral RNA by RT-LAMP

148

RT-LAMP detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a Loopamp®

149

2019-SARS-CoV-2 Detection Reagent Kit (Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) according to the

150

manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction was conducted at 62.5 °C for 35 min with the

151

turbidity measuring real-time device LoopampEXIA® (Eiken Chemical).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen by rapid antigen test

153

RAT was performed using ESPLINE® SARS-CoV-2 (Fuji Rebio Inc) according to the

154

manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the sample for analysis was obtained by dipping a swab

155

which was provided by a RAT kit into the saliva specimen and then into the sample

156

preparation mixture provided by the kit. The mixture (200 μL) was added to the sample port

157

of the antigen assay. Subsequently, 2 drops of buffer were added and the results were

158

interpreted after a 30 min incubation.

159

Definitions

160

The saliva sample collection day was defined as day 1. Symptomatic cases were

161

subdivided into two groups [22]. Severe symptomatic cases were defined as patients showing

162

clinical symptoms of pneumonia (dyspnea, tachypnea, saturation of percutaneous oxygen

163

[SpO2] < 93%, and the need for oxygen therapy). Other symptomatic cases were classified as

164

mild cases.

165

Ethical statement

166

Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient at the Self-Defense

167

Forces Central Hospital. This study was reviewed and approved by the Self-Defense Forces

168

Central Hospital (approval number 02-024) and International University of Health and

Continuous variables with a normal distribution were expressed as mean (± SD) and

172

with a non-normal distribution as median (IQR), and compared using the Student’s t-test and

173

Wilcoxon rank-sum test for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively. Categorical

174

variables were expressed as number (%) and compared by χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The

175

Kruskal-Wallis test was used for nonparametric analysis with over three independent samples.

176

Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between each molecular

Sensitivity of molecular diagnostic tests and antigen test

183

In this study, 7 diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were compared across 103 saliva

184

specimens self-collected by 103 patients (Table 1). Singleton test was conducted for each

185

method. Among the molecular diagnostic tests, LDT RT-qPCR showed the highest sensitivity

186

on analyzing the 103 saliva samples. The direct RT-qPCR Method B exhibited higher

187

sensitivity than either Method A or C. Only 12 patients tested positive using the RAT.

188

The Ct values for the N-1 and N-2 primer sets for the direct RT-qPCR Method C (35.5

189

± 2.2 and 34.8 ± 2.4, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.001) greater than those for LDT

190

RT-qPCR (32.8 ± 4.1 and 30.1 ± 4.4, respectively) (Figure 1). The mean detection time of

191

RT-LAMP was 19.1 min (SD = 4.0) (Figure 1). A significant correlation was observed

192

between RT-LAMP detection time and the Ct value of target 2 in the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test

193

(p < 0.001) (Figure 2A). All patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RAT also tested positive

194

for the six molecular diagnostic tests. The Ct value of target 2 in the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test

195

was significantly lower in saliva samples that tested positive by RAT compared to that of

196

samples that tested negative (25.4 ± 1.8 vs. 30.8 ± 2.7, respectively; p < 0.001; Figure 2B).

197

Effect of collection time on test sensitivity

198

On the day of admission, 15 patients (14.6%) who did not display any symptoms were

199

classified as asymptomatic, whereas 88 patients (85.4%) were classified as COVID-19

200

symptomatic. Of the 88 symptomatic patients, saliva specimens were collected by 61 patients

201

(69.3%) within 9 d from symptom onset (early phase of onset) and by 27 patients (30.7%)

202

after 10 d from symptom onset (late phase of onset; Table 1). Samples from early phase, late

203

phase, and asymptomatic patients tested positive by molecular diagnostic tests 65.6–93.4%,

204

22.3–66.7%, and 40.0–66.7%, respectively. The detection of saliva viral RNA was

205

significantly higher in symptomatic patients who collected their saliva within 9 d from

206

symptom onset than in saliva samples collected after 10 d from symptom onset and in saliva

207

from asymptomatic patients (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in prevalence of

208

positive results by RAT among the three groups.

209

Effect of clinical background on the prevalence of viral RNA in saliva

210

The baseline clinical characteristics of the 103 patients enrolled in this study are

211

presented in Table 2. Briefly, patient age ranged from 18 to 87 years (median, 46 years; IQR,

212

38–63 years), and 66 (64.1%) patients were male. The time from symptom onset to sample

213

collection was 1–14 d (median, 7 d; IQR, 6–10 d). The time from the initial RT-qPCR

214

positive test to sample collection was 1–8 d (median, 4 d; IQR, 3–5 d). Of the 88

215

symptomatic patients, 72 (81.8%) and 16 (18.2%) were classified as mild and severe

216

COVID-19, respectively.

217

The effect of clinical background against the prevalence of viral RNA in saliva was

218

analyzed using the results of LDT RT-qPCR, which had the highest sensitivity of all of the

219

methods in this study. Among 103 patients, a significant male sex bias was noted in samples

220

that tested positive for the virus compared to that of samples which tested negative (69.0% vs.

221

42.1%, respectively; p = 0.035) (Table 2). There were no significant differences in

222

distribution by age or disease activity between patients detected or undetected with viral RNA

223

(p > 0.05).

224

A summary of clinical symptoms and disease severity is shown for 88 symptomatic

225

patients in Table 3. The disease symptom cough was observed in 41 of 74 patients (55.4%)

226

with viral RNA in their saliva compared to 4 of 14 patients (28.6%) who did not test positive

for viral RNA (p = 0.084). All severe patients (16/16, 100%) tested positive for viral RNA in

228

their saliva, while 58 of 72 (78.4%) mild patients tested positive (p = 0.064).

231

Discussion
Here, we present evidence for the clinical usefulness of saliva specimens in diagnosing

232

COVID-19. Previous studies reported that the sensitivity of RT-qPCR-analyzed saliva

233

specimens initially collected from hospitalized patients was 69.2–100% for COVID-19

234

[10-15, 17]. The contradiction in sensitivity probably reflects differences in the clinical

235

background and timing of sampling in each study. Becker et al, reported the lowest sensitivity

236

(69.2%) using the clinical samples which were collected in late phase of onset [17]. On the

237

other hands, Azzi et al, reported the highest sensitivity on saliva (100%) among hospitalized

238

patients with severe and very severe disease [11]. In our study, the detection of viral RNA in

239

saliva was significantly higher in samples collected in the early phase of symptom onset

240

(within 9 d) compared to that in samples collected in the late phase of symptom onset (over

241

10 d), and in male patients versus female patients. Since the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in

242

saliva has been shown to decline from symptom onset [12], saliva specimens should be

243

collected during the early phase of symptom onset to increase sensitivity.

246

[23, 24] as a cell receptor to invade human cells [25]. Chen et al. collected saliva directly

247

from the opening of the salivary gland and showed that SARS-CoV-2 can infect salivary

248

glands [26]. The whole saliva flow rate is known to be higher in males than in females since

249

it is associated with the size of the salivary gland [27]. The difference in saliva flow rate may

250

affect the viral load in saliva and be associated with the difference in diagnostic sensitivity

251

between males and females. We did not observe significant differences in disease severity or

252

clinical symptoms between patients detected with or without saliva viral RNA; however, the

253

prevalence of severe disease and the symptom of cough were frequently observed in patients

254

detected with viral RNA in their saliva. Regarding disease activity, the presence of viral RNA

255

was detected in more than 50% of the asymptomatic patients. These findings support

256

previous studies reporting the presence of viral RNA in saliva of both symptomatic and

257

asymptomatic patients [14]. Therefore, our findings revealed that saliva, collected in the early

258

phase of symptom onset, is a reliable and practical source for the screening and diagnosing of

259

COVID-19.

The clinical performance of direct RT-qPCR kits and RT-LAMP, and any correlation

261

with RT-qPCR results were not well evaluated because of the small number of clinical

262

specimens collected from patients in previous studies [5, 6, 28]. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP

263

for SARS-CoV-2 using upper and lower respiratory tract specimens has been reported as

264

equivalent to RT-qPCR [5, 6, 28]. However, our results indicate that the sensitivity of

265

RT-LAMP is inferior to LDT RT-qPCR and cobas SARS-CoV-2 test for COVID-19 in saliva

266

specimens. Direct RT-qPCR kits without an RNA extraction process can reduce the time, cost,

267

and human resources needed to conduct the assay. However, we showed that there is a large

268

difference in sensitivity among the direct RT-qPCR kits. It is necessary to pay attention to the

269

false-negative results of RT-LAMP and direct RT-qPCR kits, especially when testing saliva

270

samples. In clinical settings with limited medical and human resources, using RT-LAMP and

271

direct RT-qPCR kits are options for screening and diagnosing COVID-19 because of their

272

simplicity.

273

In comparison with molecular diagnostic tests, the SARS-CoV-2 RAT of saliva

274

specimens showed low sensitivity. The sensitivity of RAT is still unclear, not only when using

275

saliva samples but also when using nasopharyngeal swab specimens [7]. The experiment to

276

compare the sensitivity of RT-qPCR and RAT prior to the approval as in vitro diagnostic test

277

by Japanese government showed that sensitivity of RAT was 66.7% (16/24 patients) for

278

nasopharyngeal swabs; furthermore, low sensitivity specimens contained a low viral copy

279

number (50% sensitivity [6/12 patients] for specimens containing < 100 copies/test) [7]. Our

280

findings also suggest that the RAT requires a high viral copy number to get positive result.

281

This kit was not originally compatible with saliva specimens and the freeze-thaw process

282

may have affected sensitivity. Improvements in sample preparation may increase its

283

sensitivity.

284

Our study had several limitations. First, the saliva specimens were collected from

285

patients 3 d (median) after receiving their first positive RT-qPCR result from analysis of

286

upper respiratory specimens. Directly comparing the sensitivity between saliva and other

287

upper or lower respiratory specimens is difficult in our study design because the viral load in

288

the clinical specimens vary with time [13]. Second, although the high specificity of RT-qPCR

289

for SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed [6, 18, 28-31], the specificities should be analyzed by

290

also using saliva from non-COVID-19 patients. Further studies are warranted to determine

291

the usefulness of saliva specimens for screening and diagnosing COVID-19.

292
293
294

Conclusions
Self-collected saliva in the early phase of symptom onset is an alternative specimen

295

diagnosing COVID-19. LDT RT-qPCR, cobas SARS-CoV2 high-throughput system, direct

296

RT-qPCR kits except for one commercial kit, and RT-LAMP showed equivalent and sufficient

297

sensitivity in clinical use and can be selectively used according to the clinical setting and

298

facilities. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test alone is not recommended for use at this time

299

due to low sensitivity.
