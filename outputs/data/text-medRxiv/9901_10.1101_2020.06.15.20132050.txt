Abstract
Roughly six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have managed to contain the spread of the virus by means of strict containment measures including quarantine, tracing and isolation of patients as well strong
restrictions on population mobility. Here we propose an extended SEIR
model to explore the dynamics of containment and then explore scenarios
for the local extinction of the disease. We present both the deterministic and
stochastic version fo the model and derive the R0 and the probability of local
extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, P0 .
We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions,
with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven
to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained. The
maintenance of defensive behaviors, such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors. We also explore the importance of
population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is among the top three biggest in the last on
hundred years, reaching levels only previously seen in Influenza pandemics[1].
At the time of writing, more than 8 million confirmed cases have been reported globally, with more than 500 thousand deaths [2]. Most affected
countries still observe transmission, even if number of new cases show signs
of reduction. Even with few cases, if cities (or countries) decide to lift quarantine measures, transmission may increase again due to the presence of sizeable
portion of susceptible individuals suddenly at greater risk of infection.
The initial containment response varied considerably across countries,
with some countries displaying more success than others in avoiding infections and subsequent deaths[3, 4, 5]. The economic impact of the containment
efforts in the form of quarantines, lock-downs, suspension of international
travelling and other drastic measures, has been remarkable [6]. This economic strain has forced many countries towards an early suspension of many
of the most severe containment measures such as quarantines and mobility
restrictions [7]. Naturally, the re-normalization of social interaction brings
with it may concerns about the potential for a second wave of transmissions,
which could potentially grow out of control [8].
Thus, an important question that emerges after a period of isolation is:
What’s the probability that local infections will be eliminated once the isolation
is lifted?. Evaluating scenarios for incidence evolution after these initial
containment efforts requires models which accommodate both biological and
population-level dynamics. In particular, models that can represent properly
the immunological aspects of COVID-19 progression as well as the impact of
containment mechanisms, such as quarantine and social distancing.
Many models have been proposed recently to deal with the temporal evolution of the epidemic[9, 10, 11], but one key aspect that must be considered
is the contribution of stochastic fluctuations to the interruption of local transmission after the number of active cases is brought close to zero. Kucharsky
et al. (2020, [12]), used an stochastic transmission model to estimate the
daily reproduction number, Rt , which is often used to predict disease extinction (Rt < 1), but empirical estimates of basic reproduction numbers
are very sensitive to noise in the testing rates as well as to changes in case
definition. Moreover, in real populations, Rt can move back above one quite

easily in response to changes in the population protective behavior.
In this paper, we approach the issue of local disease extinction by calculating the probability of extinction of the disease as a stochastic epidemic
process. In the context of epidemics, the correct epidemiological terminology
for the stochastic extinction is the local “elimination of infections”. In this
paper, however, we shall continue to use the term extinction throughout,
as it is shorter and more in line with the literature on stochastic processes.
The probability of extinction is greater when the number of infected is low,
so we calculate this probability assuming post-containment scenarios where
cases have been dropped to very low numbers. We start by presenting the
deterministic version of the model and derive its basic reproduction number.
Then we derive an stochastic version of the same model and use it to calculate an analytical expression for the extinction probability. We conclude by
looking at scenarios of local extinction and discussing how it applies to real
scenarios, including also the impact of the fraction of the population already
immunized upon the lifting of containment.

2.1. The SEIAHR model
First, we describe the (deterministic) model used to represent COVID19 dynamics. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model is
a classic model for diseases for which it is important to take into account
an incubation period, and variants of it have been employed in numerous
COVID-19 modelling studies [13, 14]. Here, we propose a variation of this
model with added asymptomatic, hospitalized compartments and a quarantine mechanism (fig. 1). Ther is no explicit compartments for Quarantied an
dead individuals as they are pure sink states that do not influence the main
dynamics.

represent the fraction of the population in each of the compartments, thus
S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + A(t) + H(t) + R(t) = 1 at any time t. Quarantine enters
the model through the parameter χ which can be taken as a constant or as a
function of time, χ(t), that represents the modulation of the isolation policies.
Quarantine works by blocking a fraction χ of the susceptibles from being

From equation (5) we can obtain Rt = R0 S(t) and another reproduction
number, denoted by Rc , which we shall call control reproduction number, as
it represents the average number of secondary cases infected by primary cases
under some control scenario – i.e. whenever χ > 0.
2.3. Probability of extinction
The question of the local extinction the disease can be more realistically
addressed with a stochastic version of the SEIAHR model, where the combination of a discrete state and stochastic state transitions allow for actual
extinctions to occur.
The transition rates from the ODE model (Eqs 1) listed on table 1, can be
used to build a continuous–time markov chain model where time is continuous
but the state is discrete, allowing for a more realistic description of population
changes over time.
This model is a multivariate stochastic process {S(t), E(t), I(t), A(t), H(t)}
where R(t) = N − (S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + A(t) + H(t)). We will leave the
equation of R out, because it is decoupled from the rest of the system. A
joint probability function is associated with the set of random state variables,
{S(t), E(t), I(t), A(t), H(t)},
Ps,e,i,a,h (t) = Pr (S(t) = s, E(t) = e, I(t) = i, A(t) = a, H(t) = h) ,

As a continuous–time branching process, the extinction threshold for the
stochastic model is closely related to the corresponding one in the deterministic model but depends on the initial number of infectious individuals[16].

P0 = R10 , where i is the initial number of infectious individuals[17].
We can apply the same technique described for the stochastic SEIR model
by Allen and Lahodny [16] to derive the probability of extinction for the
SEIAHR model.
The analysis presented in Allen and Lahodny [16] assume proximity to the
DFE with a large enough number of susceptibles and a small number of
infectious individuals. Assuming a value for R0 from other epidemics or
estimated from initial exponential growth.
For a realistic application to the COVID-19 epidemic at the moment t of the
relaxation of population lockdown, we need to acknowledge that S(t) < N ,
whilst not knowing what the exact value of S at time t and thus the effective
reproduction number at the time. Nevertheless, we know from equation (5)
that Rt is a function of S(t). Therefore, we calculate P0 for various values
of Rt .
Analytical expression for P0 . The probability of extinction, P0 , can be computed analytically following the derivation of probability-generating functions for the system of equations in (6), the details of which are given in Appendix B. The probability of extinction is computed from the fixed points of
the PGFs, q1 , q2 and q3 , which lie in (0, 1)3 . With the fixed points in hand,
we arrive at

Numerical approximation to P0 . The expression in (7), while very useful, is
derived from the assumption that the initial state is small compared to the
size of the population and that S(0) ≈ N . Due to the possible deviations
from the theoretical value of P0 when S(0) < N , In the results, we always
present estimates of P0 , obtained by simulation as well.
We can approximate P0 for a given R0 and an initial number of infected individuals (E + I + A). This can be accomplished by running a large number
of simulations of the stochastic model and computing the fraction of simulations in which the virus is driven out of the population (E + I + A = 0)
without first causing an outbreak. To facilitate setting up the simulation to
specific R0 , we can rewrite the force of infection by replacing β as a function
of R0 (eq. A.8):
γ (δ + φ) R0
.

β=
(1 − χ) [pφ + p (δ − γ) + γ]

2.4. Effect of Increasing Seroprevalence
After a first wave of infections a fraction of the population will become immunized against SARS-COV-2. This will have a protective effect on the
population even if S(t) is still above the so-called “herd immunity” threshold
of 1/R0 . The resulting adjusted P0 for different levels of population immunization can be determined through simulation of the stochastic SEIAHR
model (eq. 6).

Figure 3 shows how imposing strong containment measures can reverse the
growth of the number of cases. But a second wave starts immediately after
the restrictions are relaxed. Figure 4 shows that in three out of ten postcontainment simulations, the containment resulted in the extinction of the
disease, with the other resulting on a second wave.
Depending on the value of Rt at the moment the quarantine is lifted and the
number of remaining active cases, the probability of extinction can favor the
stochastic extinction of the disease (Fig 5).
Tables 2 and 3 contain the values of P0 for different scenarios of number of
infectious, with high and low R0 respectively.
We also estimated the P0 adjusted for different fractions of immune individuals (R) in population from 10000 simulations of the stochastic model. The
results are presented in table 5.

Most countries who managed to control the first wave of COVID-19 did it by
means of imposed restrictions on human-to-human contact. Be it through
quarantine, tracing and isolation, use of masks or a combination of social distancing tactics, they managed to minimize contacts and thus transmission.
Here we have introduced a transmission model (SEIAHR) in both deterministic and stochastic formulation, which includes the isolation of susceptibles
as a means of reducing transmission as well as different levels of infectious
individuals. From these models (deterministic and stochastic versions) it is
possible to explore the consequences of social distancing as well as to calculate the probability of a second wave upon the suspension of distancing
behavior. Figure 3 shows how imposing strong social distancing can interrupt the transmission, bringing the prevalence to near zero. However, if steps
are not taken to permanently change the way people interact in their daily
routine, at work, school, public transport, etc. The reproduction number
upon lifting of the restrictive regulations, will still be substantially higher
than one and will drive a powerful second wave if the population is still far
from herd immunity conditions.

In the deterministic version of SEIAHR, a second wave will always happen
due to the asymptotic way that the number of infectious approach zero.
Treating the epidemic process as the stochastic process that it actually is,
we can see that the probability of local extinction post-reactivation is quite
substantial (fig 5). In the stochastic SEIAHR, extinction events will happen
with slightly lower probabilities than those of a SIR model justifying using
more detailed model to study this problem. Figure 4 shows stochastic extinction taking place in three out of ten runs, with Rt = 1.7 and I0 = 2. The
Stochastic model allows us to compute the probabilities of eliminating local
transmission under various scenarios, and can be a useful tool for planning
when to lift restrictions to human mobility and interaction.
Though the probabilities of elimination of local infections seem rather low
on the basic scenarios described on tables 2, 3 and 4, these do not tell us the
whole story. If one takes into account the immunity acquired by the population during the containment period, one can see from the results in table 5,
that even if a location is still far from achieving herd immunity, any acquired
immunity will greatly improve the chances local extinction substantially.
Communities that managed to contain the disease and bring it to the brink
of extinction with severe economic impact, need to know how likely they are
in succeeding in their fight against the disease as they return to “normal”
social and economic activities. Our results also reinforce the need to run
seroprevalence surveys previous to the reopening so that the probability to
eliminate local infections e properly adjusted for the context of each locality.
Here we explored how to improve the chances for local transmission elimination but it must be kept in mind that the Rt must be kept low (through the
use of masks and social distancing) in the post-containment period to guarantee elimination and even when properly executed the time to elimination
can vary from weeks to months, as shown in table 6.

Appendix A. Derivation of the basic reproduction number
In order to use the next-generation method, we start by identifying all m
compartments containing infected individuals. In this case they are E, I
and A and m = 3. Let F be the vector of the rates of appearance of new
infections in the three infectious compartments:


λ(1 − χ)S
.
0
F =
(A.1)
0
Next, we let Vi (x)− be rate infectious individuals leave compartment i, and
Vi (x)+ be the rate with which they enter compartment i:


αE
(A.2)
V − = (δ + φ)I  ,
γA
and




0
V + = (1 − p)αE  .
pαE

After defining these we can calculate V(x) = Vi (x)− − Vi (x)+ :


αE
V = (p − 1)αE + (δ + φ)I  .
−pαE + γA

(A.3)

(A.4)

Now, if we let x = {E, I, A} and x0 be the Disease-free equilibrium (DFE),
we can define

which, after simplification, gives equation (5).

Appendix B. Probability generating functions

(A.8)

Following [16], we derive the probability-generating functions (PGF) for each
infectious compartment. Starting with Ii (0), the probability of an infected
individual in state i producing offspring of type j given that Ij (0) can be
obtained from
fi (z1 , . . . , zk ) =

Pi (z1 , . . . , zk )z1j1 · · · zkjk .

j1 =0

The desired probabilities can be obtained by differentiating the PGF with
respect to zi and setting all z to 1. Notice fi has a fixed point at z1 = . . . =
zk = 1.
Computing the relevant probabilities is straightforward by keeping track of
the possible transitions (given in Table 1) and considering that only one
transition may occur in a given time interval ∆t. First, when E(0) = 1,
I(0) = 0 and A(0) = 0, we have
f1 (z1 , z2 , z3 ) = (1 − p)z2 + pz3 ,

282

(B.1)

and when E(0) = 0, I(0) = 1 and A(0) = 0 the PGF is
f2 (z1 , z2 , z3 ) =

β(1 − χ)z1 z2 + δ + φ
.
β(1 − χ) + δ + φ

Finally, for the case E(0) = 0, I(0) = 0 and A(0) = 1:

From the PGFs, we can obtain a matrix M whose entries mji = ∂u

the expected number of offspring in state j from an individual in state i.
Given the PGFs above, we arrive at

To obtain the probability of extinction, P0 , we need to find the fixed points of
the PGFs, i.e. solutions to equations of the form fi (q1 , q2 , q3 ) = qi , qi ∈ (0, 1).
After some tedious algebra, we arrive at
