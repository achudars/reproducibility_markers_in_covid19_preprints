Abstract
New York City’s Health Department developed a SARS-CoV-2 percent test positivity cluster
detection system using census tract resolution and the SaTScan prospective space-time scan
statistic. One cluster led to identifying a gathering with inadequate social distancing where viral
transmission likely occurred, and another cluster prompted targeted community testing and
outreach.

Spatiotemporal analysis of high resolution COVID-19 data can support local health
officials to monitor disease spread and target interventions (1,2). Publicly available data have
been used to detect COVID-19 space-time clusters at county and daily resolution across the US
(3,4) and purely spatial clusters at ZIP code resolution in New York City (NYC) (5).
For routine public health surveillance, the NYC Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene (DOHMH) uses the case-only space-time permutation scan statistic (6) in SaTScan1 to
detect new outbreaks of reportable diseases (7) (e.g., Legionnaires’ disease (8) and salmonellosis
(9)). Given wide variability in SARS-CoV-2 testing across space and time, case-only analyses
could be poorly suited for COVID-19 monitoring, as true differences in disease rates would be
indistinguishable from changes in testing rates across space and time. Moreover, we sought to
detect newly emerging or re-emerging hotspots during an ongoing epidemic, which is more
challenging than detecting a newly emerging outbreak in the context of minimal or stable disease
incidence.
A new approach was needed to detect areas where COVID-19 diagnoses were increasing
or not decreasing as quickly relative to other parts of the city. We launched the system on June
11, 2020 to detect community-based clusters of increased SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in nearreal time at census tract resolution in NYC, accounting for testing variability.

The Study
Clinical and commercial laboratories are required to report all results (including positive,
negative, and indeterminate results) for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests for New York State residents to
the New York State Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS) (10). For NYC

residents, ECLRS transmits reports to DOHMH. Laboratory reports include specimen collection
date and patient demographics, including residential address. Patient symptoms and illness onset
date, if any, are obtained through patient interviews, although not all patients are interviewed.
To detect emerging clusters, the space-time scan statistic uses a cylinder where the
circular base covers a geographical area and the height corresponds to time (11). This cylinder is
moved, or “scanned,” over both space and time to cover different areas and time periods. At each
position, the number of cases inside the cylinder is compared with the expected count under the
null hypothesis of no clusters using a likelihood function, and the position with the maximum
likelihood is the primary candidate for a cluster. The statistical significance of this cluster is then
evaluated, adjusting for the multiple testing inherent in the many cylinder positions evaluated.
To quickly detect emerging hotspots, prospective analyses are conducted daily (12). To
adjust for the multiple testing stemming from daily analyses, recurrence intervals are used
instead of p-values (13). A recurrence interval of D days means that under the null hypothesis, if
we conduct the analysis repeatedly over D days, then the expected number of clusters of the
same or larger magnitude is one.
The space-time scan statistic can be utilized with different probability models. We used
the Poisson model (11), where the number of cases is distributed according to the Poisson
probability model, with an expected count proportional to the number of persons tested.
Analyses were adjusted non-parametrically for purely geographical variations that were
consistent over time, as the goal was to detect newly emerging hotspots. Fitting a log-linear
function, we also adjusted for citywide temporal trends in percent positivity, as the goal was to
detect local hotspots rather than general citywide trends. To prioritize quickly emerging clusters
to identify epidemiologic linkages, we used a short maximum temporal window of 7 days. As we

wished to also detect sustained clusters to inform place-based resource allocation, we
additionally ran analyses using a maximum temporal window of 21 days.
We developed SAS code (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) that generated input and
parameter files (Table 1, Technical Appendix Table 1), invoked SaTScan in batch mode, read
analysis results back into SAS for further processing, and output files to secured folders,
including a patient linelist, visualizations, and investigator notification email. Similar SAS code
referencing markedly different input parameters is freely available.2 Parameters were adjusted
during the study period to improve signal prioritization, including increasing the minimum
number of cases in clusters from 2 to 5 cases.
Given changing cluster definitions and investigation protocols during the study period,
instead of summarizing all clusters detected, we present three illustrative examples (Table 2). On
June 22, in the context of waning case counts citywide, the system detected a not statistically
significant cluster of 6 patients residing in a 0.6-kilometer radius, all with specimens collected on
June 17 (Figure 1A). DOHMH staff interviewed patients for common exposures, such as
attending the same event or visiting the same location. On June 23, a DOHMH surveillance
investigator (D.B.) determined that two patients in the cluster had attended the same gathering,
where recommended social distancing practices had not been observed. In response, DOHMH
launched an effort to limit further transmission, including testing, contact tracing, community
engagement, and health education emphasizing the importance of isolation and quarantine.
Investigation of patients in the cluster with the highest recurrence interval (323 days) during the
study period did not reveal any epidemiologic linkages. Detection of a sustained cluster (lasting
>1 week) with high percent positivity (8.9%) (Figure 1B) supported the selection of one ZIP

code for targeted testing and outreach, as part of NYC’s hyper-local plan to prevent COVID-19
transmission (14).

Conclusions
Automated spatiotemporal cluster detection analyses detected emerging, highly focused
areas to target COVID-19 containment efforts in NYC. For jurisdictions where case investigation
capacity is limited, interviewing patients in clusters, even if not statistically significant, can help
identify common exposures for interrupting further transmission. Regardless of whether
epidemiologic linkages are identified — or whether overall transmission is increasing,
decreasing, or steady — clusters can be used to prioritize resources and focus interventions such
as promoting increased testing, public messaging, and community engagement activities.
Our system is subject to several limitations. First, analyses were based on specimen
collection date, but given delays in testing availability and care seeking, these dates did not
necessarily represent recent infections. Timeliness was further limited by delays from specimen
collection to laboratory testing and reporting. Clusters dominated by asymptomatic patients or
patients with illness onset >14 days prior to diagnosis may not require intervention, as a positive
PCR result indicates the presence of viral RNA but not necessarily viable virus (15). Second,
geocoding is required for precision, and of unique NYC residents with a specimen collected
during June–July 2020 for a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, approximately 3% had a nongeocodable residential address and were excluded from analyses. Finally, automation coding was
complex (Technical Appendix). Planned SaTScan software enhancements that will facilitate
wider adoption by other health departments include: adding a software interface for prospective
surveillance, enabling temporal and spatial adjustments for the Bernoulli probability model, and

enabling the log-linear temporal trend adjustment with automatically calculated trend at a subannual scale.
Our COVID-19 early detection system has highlighted areas in NYC warranting a rapid
response. Such local targeted, place-based approaches are necessary to minimize further
transmission and to better protect people at high risk for severe illness, including older adults and
people with underlying health conditions.

Defining a study period at least 3
times the maximum temporal window
helps with statistical power.
Extending the study period further
may decrease the accuracy of the
temporal trend adjustment but might
be of interest to detect more
prolonged clusters. If citywide
percent positivity reaches an
inflection point (e.g., begins to
increase again after a period of
decrease), the study period will need
to be temporarily shortened and reset
after that inflection point to
accurately adjust for the temporal
trend. For longer temporal window,
selected June 1, 2020 as earliest date
when citywide percent positivity
trend appeared stable without an
inflection point.
Given lags between specimen
collection and report, exclude very
incomplete data at end of study period
when estimating the temporal trend.
Three days is the minimum lag
possible to preserve a timely analysis
while allowing for at least some data
to be reported, geocoded, and
analyzed prior to open of business.

Notes
For timely cluster detection, prospective (rather
than retrospective) analyses are used,
evaluating only the subset of possible clusters
that encompass the last day of the study period.
To detect acute, ongoing, localized disease
clusters, space-time analyses (rather than purely
temporal or purely spatial analyses), are used
We apply the discrete Poisson-based scan
statistic, defining the “population” file as
persons tested, to scan for clusters of increased
percent positivity. If SARS-CoV-2 percent
positivity is high (say, >10%), then the discrete
Poisson-based scan statistic is a poor
approximation for Bernoulli-type data of
persons testing positive and negative. The
analysis would produce conservative p-values
(i.e., recurrence intervals biased too low), and
true clusters might be missed. However,
SaTScan v9.6 does not include features for
spatial and temporal adjustments for the
Bernoulli probability model.
The option that imposes the fewest assumptions
is to allow the cluster to expand in size to
include up to 50% of all persons tested during
the study period. Forcing clusters to be smaller
than 50%, or restricting in terms of geographic
size by setting a maximum circle radius, can be
motivated in geographically larger study
regions.
To focus on hotspots emerging during the most
recent week; to focus on areas with more
sustained emerging increases.

Clusters of <3-day duration considered less
credible for investigation as an emerging
hotspot; clusters of <7 days considered lower
priority for resource allocation.

decreasing slower than citywide average. If
citywide percent positivity increasing overall,
then wish to detect areas where increasing more
than citywide average. Adjusting for temporal
trend nonparametrically is not possible if also
using nonparametric spatial adjustment.
Goal is to detect areas with relative increases
from baseline, even if still lower than average
citywide. This method adjusts the expected
count separately for each location, removing all
purely spatial clusters. The randomization is
then stratified by location ID to ensure that each
location has the same number of events in the
real and random data sets.
Interested only in increased disease
transmission.
A maximum of 9999 replications increases
power compared with 999 replications and is
computationally feasible.

Any disease may have multiple active clusters
at any moment, so secondary clusters should be
reviewed. By reviewing clusters with no cluster
centers in other clusters (rather than no, or more
geographic overlap), secondary clusters with
some overlap can be detected.

performed against the Department of City Planning’s Street Name Dictionary and Property
Address Directory. Addresses that failed to geocode after cleaning were then verified using the
IBM Infosphere USPS service.

Study period and time precision
SaTScan v.9.6 can estimate a temporal trend (see below), but only at an annual time
scale, as this feature was originally developed to accommodate long-term secular trends across
multiple years, as for cancer incidence. As a workaround to accommodate a rapidly changing
trend, as for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, reassign one day as if it were one year in the SaTScan
case and population input files and conduct analyses at annual resolution. For example, for a 21day study period ending June 19, 2020, reassign May 30, 2020 as the year “2000” and June 19,
2020 as the year “2020,” and indicate a time precision and a time aggregation of “year,” (i.e.,
PrecisionCaseTimes=1 and TimeAggregationUnits=1 in the SaTScan parameter file). The
minimum and maximum temporal cluster sizes would be input as years instead of days.
Similarly, with input data expressed in years, nonparametric adjustment for space by day-ofweek interaction was not possible. Note that in calculating the recurrence interval, SaTScan
assumes that analyses are repeated on a regular basis with a periodicity equal to the specified
time interval length. Because these daily analyses are specified at annual time intervals, interpret
recurrence intervals in days, not years; e.g., a recurrence interval of 1.0 years in this context
should be re-interpreted as 1.0 days, i.e., consistent with chance alone.

Temporal trend adjustment
As a workaround for a bug in SaTScan v.9.6 in calculating a temporal trend adjustment in
the prospective setting, first use the case and population files to run a retrospective purely
temporal Poisson analysis, with the temporal adjustment “Log linear with automatically
calculated trend” (TimeTrendAdjustmentType=3 in the SaTScan parameter file). Read in this
automatically calculated temporal trend from the SaTScan text output. Retain the magnitude of
trend (“X”) and sign of X determined by “increase” or “decrease.” Example SaTScan text output
excerpt:

SaTScan v9.6

Retrospective Purely Temporal analysis
scanning for clusters with high rates
using the Discrete Poisson model.
Adjusted for time trend with an annual decrease of 6.42984%.

The time trend is the same for retrospective and prospective analyses. Then, run the
prospective spatio-temporal Poisson analysis, inserting the calculated time trend in the parameter
file as user-specified (TimeTrendAdjustmentType=2, TimeTrendPercentage=-6.42984 in the
SaTScan parameter file). Example user interface screenshot:

If unable to enter a negative value for the temporal trend adjustment in the user interface,
then edit the “TimeTrendPercentage” value in the SaTScan parameter file in a text editor (e.g.,
Notepad), then reopen in SaTScan.
