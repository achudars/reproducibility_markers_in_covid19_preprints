Abstract

objectives: to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 (PCR-test) in residents and staff of a nursing home.
To examine the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies in the sample and the relation between PCR and
antibody test results.

design: cross-sectional and (retrospective) cohort study
setting: a nursing home for the elderly Bessemerberg in Lanaken (Belgium) with up to 130 beds.
Lanaken is situated in the Belgian province with the highest COVID-19 prevalence.

participants: residents (N=108) and staff members (N=93) of the nursing home
outcomes: PCR, IgM and IgG
results: the prevalence of COVID-19, based on PCR test was 34% (N=40) for residents and 13% (N=11)
for staff members, respectively. Of the residents, 13% showed positive IgM results and 15% positive
IgG results. In 17% of the residents, at least one of the antibodies was positive. In total 13% of the
staff members had positive IgM and 16% had a positive IgG. In 20% of the staff members at least one
of these antibody tests was positive. In PCR positive residents, the percentage of IgM positive, IgG
positive, and at least one of both was 28%, 34%, and 41%. In PCR positive staff, we found 30%, 60%,
and 60%. Additional antibody tests were performed in nine residents between day 11 and 14 after
the positive PCR test. Of those, 7 (78%) tested positive on at least one antibody. When retesting
three weeks later, all remaining residents also tested positive.

conclusions: Recently it was reported that in Belgium antibodies are present in 3-4% of the general
population. Although, the prevalence in our residents is higher, the number is largely insufficient for
herd immunity. In staff members of the regional hospital the prevalence of antibodies was 6%. The
higher prevalence in nursing home staff (21%) may be related to the complete absence of good
quality protection in the first weeks of the outbreak.

Key words: COVID-19 – antibody testing – nursing homes – herd immunity

Article summary
Strengths and limitations of this study
-This is the first study in Belgium examining the prevalence of COVID-19 and the presence of
antibodies in residents and staff members of a nursing home
-The internal procedural control was positive -with one exception- in all tests, which suggests good
quality sampling and testing.
-Some degree of selection bias should be assumed in residents, since some residents were absent;
mostly from hospitalisation or death which can be related to the presence of COVID-related disease.
-The study was set up in one nursing home and is consequently not representative for the whole of
the Flemish community

Introduction
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China.[1] Since then, the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the severe acute respiratory
syndrome called coronavirus disease (COVID-19), succeeded to spread across the world and has been
entitled as a pandemic.[2] The first confirmed case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in Belgium, identified
on February 4th was a businessman returning from China who was successfully quarantined in the
following weeks.[3] The second positive case was documented on February 29th, followed by a series
of new positive cases and confirmed local transmission early March 2020. Afterwards the virus was
rapidly spread throughout the entire country leading to instigated rules by the government.
In Belgium, the SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread within medical and nursing facilities. Currently, the
majority of the people whom died of COVID-19 occurred in nursing homes, and not in a hospital
setting.[4] Thereby, a shortage of health workers in these nursing home facilities is at risk due to the
infection of many staff members; which may put further pressure on the already strained health
systems.
The nursing home for the elderly (woon- en zorgcentrum (WZC)) Bessemerberg in Lanaken (Belgium)
is a private long-term care facility, founded in 2011 with a normal capacity of 130 beds. Mean age of
the residents is 86 years. It is worthwhile to know that Lanaken is situated in the Belgian province
with the highest COVID-19 prevalence, and at less than 40 kms from Gangelt, the place of one of the
first major outbreaks of COVID-19 in Germany in February 2020.[5] The first patient in the WZC was
diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 24thand the outbreak was traced to a carnival activity on
February 15th. The first staff member of wzc Bessemerberg, a nurse, tested positive on PCR on March
20th 2020 and was immediately quarantined at home. The first resident tested positive on
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 30.3.2020, and most likely was infected much earlier by family.
Between March 30th and April 16th 15 (12%) residents died, of which 14 tested positive with PCR, and
one tested negative. To manage the outbreak, at April 20th we opened a separate COVID ward within
our institution, with a capacity of 22 beds.
As the evolution of the epidemiological picture began to take shape and test results became
available, we tried to answer the following questions:
1. What is the prevalence of COVID-19, based on PCR test results in residents and nursing staff?
2. What is the prevalence of IgM and IgG antibodies in residents and nursing staff two weeks
after the first resident was diagnosed with COVID-19?
3. What is the influence of age, sex and ward allocation on antibody and PCR tests?

4. What is the relation between PCR and antibody test results, both cross-sectionally and
longitudinally?

Methods

Testing & outcomes
Before 16.4.2020 both residents and staff members were systematically tested by PCR in case of
signs and symptoms suggestive for COVID-19 at the initiative of the general practitioner (GP) or the
local coordinating GP of the institution (CRA). The first PCR tests were performed by local
laboratories in accordance with the WHO guidelines on nasopharyngeal swabs sampled by the GP or
the CRA. On April 16th 2020, all residents and staff members not already tested before were sampled
bilaterally in the back of the throat and to the fore of the nose and tested with PCR within the
framework of a national governmental survey of nursing homes. A participant was considered PCR+ if
he or she tested positive between March 20th and April 16th.
Antibody testing was performed by the CRAs, aided by volunteers within the framework of a survey
performed to support clinical work between 14 and 16.4.2020. Testing was performed using a point
of care lateral flow assay with capillary whole blood from a fingerprick according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. We used the Sure Screen Diagnostics Covid-19 IgG/IgM Rapid test
casette (Sure Screen Diagnostics, Derby, UK) (Figure 1). Validations by the manufacturer and at the
University Hospitals Leuven found a specificity of 95-99%, and a sensitivity of 85-100% for IgG 14-25
days after onset of symptoms. For the IgM, sensitivity was 92% and specificity 99% (instructions of
the producer, Sure Screen Diagnostics, Derby, UK).
A test was considered positive for IgM/IgG (IgM/IgG +) if at least IgM or IgG was positive. There was
only one device failure (the control line was not visible).

Within wzc Bessemerberg, there are under normal circumstances three wards wit 50, 40 and 40 beds
respectively. Nursing staff tends to be affiliated to one of these wards.

When analysing the

association with wards (residents and staff) and working situation (staff), we combined as
‘paramedical’, those staff members who have direct contact with resident, but are not directly
working at one specific ward (e.g., physiotherapists, nurses working night shifts, etc.). As ‘nonmedical’ we categorised staff members without regular direct patient contacts (e.g., administration
or maintenance).

As soon as the COVID-19 ward was initiated, all PCR positive residents were brought to this ward,
unless they were already considered preterminal. A resident was returned to his or her normal room
two weeks after the initial positive PCR test, provided that the resident was clinically stable and
asymptomatic for at least three days. [6]
All participant-related information was coded and treated according to the Belgian Privacy law and
the GDPR. The chairman of the ethical review board of the ZOL hospital in Genk confirmed that a
formal ethical review was not required.

Patient and public involvement
Patients and the public were not directly involved in the design or the recruitment of the study.

Statistics
All questions were answered in a descriptive way, using bivariate statistical tests (chi² test or oneway ANOVA) or Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis if appropriate.
To answer the longitudinal questions, we also performed multiple logistic regression, testing the
influence of PCR results, participant type (resident or staff), ward, and gender on the presence of
sars-CoV-2 antibodies (IgM, IgG, either one of them). Age was not used in the model, because of the
overlap between age and role (resident or staff).

Results
One hundred-thirty residents and 112 staff members were considered for PCR and antibody testing.
Some residents were not tested because at the time of the sampling they were either in hospital or
deceased. Some staff members decided not to participate or were absent at the time of the
sampling. In total, N=119 residents and N=93 staff members were tested. The number of residents
and staff members who were tested (denominators) with PCR and with the antibody test are not
identical as both tests were not performed in parallel on the same day and not everyone was tested
with both tests.
In total, 200 people had a PCR test and 51 of the participants (26%) had a positive test. Of the 118
residents who had a PCR test, 40 (34%) had a positive result. Of the 82 staff members, 11 (13%) had a
positive result. Of 188 people tested for antibodies (residents and staff combined), 13% was positive
on IgM, 15% on IgG and 19% on at least one of both. Of the residents,17% tested positive for IgM/IgG
(13% for IgM and 15% for IgG). Of the staff members, 20% tested positive for IgM/IgG, 13% for IgM
and 16% for IgG (table 1).

Specification according to the wards, gender, age, and symptoms
Prevalence of antibodies was strongly related to the allocated ward where a resident lives. It was
very low on ward 1, and much higher on ward 2 and 3 (table 2).
Table 2: insert here

Table 3: insert here

The association between ward or working place and antibody prevalence in staff members is weaker
compared to residents (table 3).
No association was found between either IgM or IgG or both and gender, neither in residents nor
staff: adjusted odds ratio according to Mantel-Haenszel = 0.59 (0.19-1.83); p = 0.36.
No association was found between either IgM or IgG or both and age, neither in residents nor staff: p
= between 0.34 – 0.91 (ANOVA)
There was no significant association between a positive IgM, IgG of one of these and presence of
serious symptoms at the time of sampling (OR = 1.17, 1.75, 1.4; p = between 0.11 - 0.45).
For all antibodies, a multiple logistic regression analysis resulted in a model with only a positive PCR
test as a significant predictor: coefficient = between 1.08 – 2.14; p = between < 0.001 – 0.09).
Gender, ward, and role remained insignificant

PCR result and the presence of antibodies
We had both PCR and antibody results of 176 participants (99 residents and 77 staff). Of the 42
participants who were positive with PCR, 19 (45%) also had antibodies (IgM/IgG +). Of 134 PCR
participants who were negative with PCR, 15 (11%) had antibodies (IgM/IgG +).
In PCR positive residents, the percentage of IgM positive, IgG positive, or at least one of both was
28%, 34%, and 41%. In PCR positive staff, we found 30%, 60%, and 60% (table 4).

In 16 residents, a positive PCR test was detected before 3.4.2020. Of those, seven were in hospital or
deceased on 16.4.2020. Therefore, nine residents of this group were available for antibody testing.
They were tested for antibodies between day 11 and 14 after the positive PCR test.
Of those, 4 (44%), 6 (67%) and 7 (78%) tested positive on IgM, IgG, or at least one of them. The
positive IgM results were detected on day 12 and 13 after the positive PCR test, the positive IgG
results on day 11, 12, 13 and 14. The two IgM/IgG negative tests were performed 14 and 22 days
after the positive PCR. When retesting antibodies three weeks later (12.5.2020), both remaining
residents also tested positive on IgG.

Discussion
End of April 2020 the prevalence of IgG antibodies in the general population in Belgium was 3-4%
(measured using the Eurimmun IgG Elisa, based on rest-samples of routine blood testing in
ambulatory medicine.[7] Recently, the local hospital surveyed its staff and reported presence of
COVID antibodies in 6%. Our study reports a presence of IgM and/or IgG in 17% of residents and 20%
of nursing staff in a nursing home. The large difference between hospital staff (6%) and nursing home
staff (21%) probably relates to the complete absence of good quality protection for nursing home
personnel in the first weeks of the outbreak. The prevalence in our participants is much higher
compared to the general population, although even this is largely insufficient for herd immunity, now
or in the near future.
The current gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the detection of viral RNA in respiratory
tract samples. Its sensitivity is, however, only around 54%-74% for nasopharyngeal swabs. Falsenegative results can occur, due to sampling error and in patients with low viral loads, especially in
patients who present at day 8 after infection or later, and mild cases.[8] In our group of PCR negative
participants this shows as 11% (15/134) having a positive IgG or IgM or both.
Antibodies can be detected within two weeks after detection of a positive PCR. In our group, it was
44% for IgM and 78% for either IgG or IgM). As also found elsewhere [9], the moment at which
antibodies can be detected with a high sensitivity is therefore insufficient for their use as an early
diagnostic test. Out of a group of nine residents, who were tested some two weeks after a positive
PCR test, two were IgM and IgG negative. When retesting three weeks later, however, both showed
positive IgGs, suggesting that at least in this small group all PCR positive residents formed IgG
antibodies, if given a sufficient amount of time.

In PCR positive participants, presence of either IgG or IgM was found in 41% of residents and 60 % of
nursing staff. This difference suggests that antibody production could be lower or slower in residents
of nursing homes, although we cannot rule out that PCR-positive staff members were on average
infected earlier than residents
Presence of antibodies in residents differed largely according to the wards where they are living. It is
minimal at the first ward and far more frequent at ward two and three (5%, 29% and 22%
respectively of the residents have IgM or IgG antibodies). These are also the two wards where
outbreak effects became first clear, and which showed the largest numbers of illnesses and deaths.
These differences were far less in staff members. The large differences between wards in the number
of residents support the emerging plans to reorganise homes for the elderly in smaller living units,
i.e. with ten rooms instead of 30 or 40 as is currently the standard in Belgium.

Strengths and limitations
Testing and reading the results was easy to perform. It was also reassuring that – with one exception
– the internal procedural control was positive in all tests, which suggests correct sampling and
testing. The one exception was one of the first tests performed, probably due to an insufficient
amount of blood. Other validation studies resulted in sensitivities after 14-17 days between 85-100 %
(instructions of the producer, Sure Screen Diagnostics, Derby, UK). This is less than perfect, but
similar to common Elisa tests. Specificity, which in this situation is the most important, was between
96-99%; which is excellent.
Some eligible people were not tested. For staff, this mostly resulted from absence of work without
any direct association with COVID-related disease. We therefore do not expect any selection bias
resulting from this incompleteness of data. For residents, however, absence resulted mostly from
hospitalisation or death. Of course, this can be related to presence of COVID-related disease and
some degree of selection bias should be assumed. These numbers are low (mostly less than ten),
however, and will not largely influence our results or conclusions.

Consequences of our study for clinical work and for future research
Information on antibody status can be useful to support decisions in the further course after a COVID
infection. For residents, presence of IgG in association with absence of signs and symptoms and a
period of at least two weeks after the first positive PCR result, could be considered a criterion for
discharge from the COVID ward to the normal rooms. A negative PCR result cannot be considered the
ultimate criterium for discharge since PCR can be both false-negative later during the course of the
infection and false-positive due to detection of residual RNA after viral clearance. For staff members,

the presence of IgG means they are unlikely to get reinfected in the next months and spread the
virus. Staffing our nursing homes with staff who tested positive for IgG could help bring down the
high case-fatality rates. [10]. It is not sure, however, how long immunity, if present, will last.
Antibody testing can also be used for epidemiological purposes. Follow-up of a population with
antibody testing describes the gravity and evolution of the epidemic. [6, 11, 12] It can also show how
far away we still are from herd immunity. Finally, it can help to identify convalescent cases or people
with milder disease who might have been missed by a PCR survey when performing network analysis
[13].
It looks appropriate, to follow the presence of antibodies over time in (a subgroup of) our antibodypositive participants. After 6, 12, 24, and 60 months we can then study if IgG antibodies are still
present.
