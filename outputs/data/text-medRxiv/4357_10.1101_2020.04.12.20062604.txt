Abstract
Introduction: The purpose of the study was to summarize the clinical and laboratory
characteristics of the coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted to intensive care unit.
Methods: We tracked the data until March 5, 2020. The cases in our cohort were divided into
cases only received noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and cases required invasive mechanical
ventilation (IMV). The characteristics between the two groups were compared.
Results: 34 cases were included in the study. The complications rate (including, acute liver injury,
acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury) were higher in IMV cases. Lymphocytopenia and
neutrophilia occurred in most cases in both groups on the admission day, however, lymphocyte
levels dropped progressively and more severe lymphopenia occurred in IMV group. Increased
amounts of plasma IL-6 and IL-10 were found in both groups on the admission day, the
progressive decrease of which occurred in NIV cases rather than IMV cases, and the levels were
higher in IMV cases during hospitalization.
Conclusions: Lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and increase of IL-6 and IL-10 occurred in
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in ICU, however, the dynamics of those were significantly
different in IMV cases and NIV cases during hospitalization.
Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinical characteristics, intensive care unit
(ICU), mechanical ventilation

Introduction
In December 2019, a series of acute respiratory illness of unknown cause, now known as
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2, emerged in Wuhan, Hubei,
China. SARS-Cov-2 was classified in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. It has rapidly and widely
spread in China and many other countries, causing an outbreak of COVID-19, and has caused
great economic loss and mental health stress.
As of 10 March 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China is more than
80000, of which the death toll has exceeded 3000 [1]. COVID-19 is now the third lethal illness
caused by coronavirus following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2] and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) [3]. One third of COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU. As the
epidemic progresses, the treatment of severe and critical patients is the key to success of the

epidemic battle. The COVID-19 fatality rate between Hubei and non-Hubei are significant
differences [1]. The dynamic analysis of the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in ICU of
non-Hubei area may have better guiding significance for the future severe patients
We intend to describe clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of
confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in a tertiary teaching hospital in Hangzhou, a
place far away from Wuhan in China. The Department of critical care medicine in this hospital is a
national key clinical specialty and regional critical diagnosis and treatment center in Zhejiang
province. During the COVID-19 epidemic, some severe patients transferred from the surrounding
cities were treated in the hospital. The novel coronavirus pneumonia here is characterized by
regional representation.

Methods
Participants and Study Design
For this retrospective, single-centre study, we analysed patients from Jan 22, 2020, to Mar 5, 2020,
who had been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, according to the Chinese National Health
Commission guidance[4], in ICU at the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine

，Zhejiang

University, Hangzhou, which is a designated hospital for COVID-19 treatment. Oral consent was
obtained from the authorized person. This study was approved by the National Health
Commission of China and Ethics Commission of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of

，

Medicine Zhejiang University (IIT20200077A). Conditions for admission to ICU in our research:
dyspnea and respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min, oxygen saturation ≤ 93% at rest without oxygen
inhalation, PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ≤ 300mmHg (1mmHg=0.133kPa), other organ dysfunction such as
shock.
Data Collection
Two researchers independently reviewed patients’ medical records for epidemiological,
demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcome data which were collected until
March 5, 2020. The time of disease onset was defined as the day when any related symptom was
noticed which were ascertained through researcher communicating with patients or their families.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified according to the Berlin definition [5].

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was identified according to the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guidelines
[6]. Acute liver injury defined as an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) over two times the
upper limit of the normal range (ULN) or conjugated bilirubin or a combined increase in aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin provided that one of them was
above two times ULN [7]. Cardiac injury followed the definition described in the previous study
[8]. Noninvasive ventilation included nasal oxygen therapy, mask oxygen inhalation and HFNC.
The durations from onset of disease to first positive nucleic acid testing of respiratory tract
specimen, ICU admission, ARDS, HFNC, IPPV, ECMO were recorded.
Laboratory Confirmation and Treatment
Laboratory tests, including complete blood count, serum biochemistry, coagulation profile, lactate
dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein etc. were conducted in the hospital laboratory. Plasma
cytokines from all patients (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ) were detected by ELISA
method according to the manufacturer’s instructions. T, NK and B lymphocyte cell counts were
tested by flow cytometry. Respiratory specimens of all patients, including sputum, pharyngeal
swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or bronchial aspirates were tested for SARS-Cov-2, using
real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays [8]. Antiviral treatment were used
in most patients. The majority of patients received treatment with corticosteroid and gamma
globulin, the specific dose of which was determined by the chief physician according to the
patient's condition. Antibiotics were empirically administered.
Indications for HFNC: ratio of PaO2 to FiO2 (P/F) < 200, resting respiratory rate was more
than 20 per minute and the patient was conscious and cooperative. The timing of invasive
ventilation: P/F < 150, resting respiratory rate was more than 30 per minute, uncooperative
patients, serious complications such as shock. Indications for ECMO [9]: severe hypoxemia (e.g.,
P/F < 80, despite the application of high levels of positive end expiration pressure [typically
15–20 cm of water]) for at least 6 hr in patients with potentially reversible respiratory failure,
uncompensated hypercapnia with acidemia (pH < 7.15) or excessively high end-inspiratory
plateau pressure (>35–45 cm of water, according to the patient’s body size) despite the best
accepted standard of care for management with a ventilator.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were described medians with interquartile ranges and compared with the

Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were described using frequency rates and percentages
and compared by χ² test or Fisher’s exact test. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 22.0. The
patients in our cohort were divided into cases only received NIV and cases required IMV, because
the way of respiratory support was independently associated with the process and outcome [10,
11]. The clinical and laboratory characteristics between the two groups were compared

Results
By 5 March 2020, 35 cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 in ICU at the First Affiliated Hospital,

，Zhejiang University, Hangzhou were investigated. Of the 35 cases, an

College of Medicine

infected pregnant woman admitted to ICU after caesarean section was excluded because she was
an exception and didn't measure up to the ICU admissions standard. Finally, 34 cases were
included in the study. None was residents of Wuhan City. No patients had direct exposure to
Huanan seafood market and only 9 patients had been exposed to individuals with confirmed
SARS-Cov-2 infection or clustering onset. 17 cases had history of sojourn in epidemic area or
close contacted with people from the epidemic area. 8 had no history of any of the above. The
median duration from onset of symptoms to the time of first nucleic acid test positive was 4 (IQR
1-7) days. The median duration from onset of symptoms to ICU admission was 10.0 (7·0–11·3)
days, to HFNC was 10 (7-11) days in 27 patients, to IMV was 11(8-12) days in 15 cases, to
ECMO was 23(18-29) days in 11 patients. (Fig 1)
The median age was 66 years (IQR 58-76 years) and 23 (67.6%) were men. 24 (70.6%)
patients had chronic diseases, including hypertension (64.7%), diabetes (23.5%), cardiovascular
disease (11.8%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.9%), chronic liver disease (11.8%),
chronic kidney disease (5.9%). The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever
(58.8%), dry cough (20.6%), and expectoration (29.4%; table 1), relative less common initial
symptoms were myalgia (14.7%), fatigue (5.9%), diarrhea (5.9%), headache (5.9%). The
proportion of different comorbidities and the distribution of first symptoms did not differ
obviously. (Table 1)
The blood cells counts on admission showed that leukocytosis (white blood cell count more

than 10 × 10⁹/L, 15 [44.1%] cases) occurred in nearly half of the patients, while, the incidence of
leucopenia (white blood cell count less than 4 × 10⁹/L, 2 [5.9%] cases) is very low. Lymphopenia
(lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 10⁹/L, 22 [66.4%] patients) occurred in more than half of the patients
on admission. Platelet count in NIV group was higher than in IMV group, which were in normal
range in most patients of both groups. No significant differences were found between NIV and
IMV groups in terms of biochemical indexes, inflammation or immune indicators and coagulation
indices on admission to hospital. (Table 2)
Only one patient did not receive antiviral and systematic corticosteroid treatment. 30 (88.2%)
were given empirical antibiotic treatment, and 27 (79.4%) were given gamma globulin treatment.
18 patients (52.9%) received HFNC without escalation of respiratory support. 15 (44.1%) received
IMV and ECMO was required in 11 patients (32.4%). Continuous renal replacement therapy
(CRRT) was conducted in 5(14.7%) cases. Common complications among the 34 ICU patients
included ARDS (33 [97.1%]), acute liver injury (13 [38%]), acute cardiac injury (13 [38%]), and
AKI (7[20.6%]). The complications rates (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac injury and
AKI) were significantly higher and discharge rate was notably lower in IMV cases, compared with
NIV patients. (Table 3)
Dynamic changes of the main laboratory indicators during COVID-19 progression including
blood cells counts and biochemical parameters, coagulation profile and inflammatory cytokines
were followed from day 1 to day 9 or discharged day after admission at 1-day interval. White
blood cell counts and neutrophil counts were at high levels during hospitalization, and showed
declining trends on discharge day in NIV patients. During hospitalization, most patients had
marked lymphopenia, and IMV patients developed more severe lymphopenia over time, but
lymphocytes returned to normal levels in NIV cases on discharge day. Flow cytometry showed
that T lymphocytes counts were further away from the lower normal limit, compared to B
lymphocytes in inpatients. T lymphocytes counts stayed low during hospitalization in IMV
patients, however, the counts gradually rose to normal level until discharge in a part of NIV
patients. Natural killer cells counts in most inpatients were far from the lower normal limit, and
the counts progressive declined in IMV cases rather in NIV cases during hospitalization. Platelet
counts and hemoglobin levels were higher in NIV cases than those in IMV cases, and hemoglobin
levels dropped progressively in IMV cases during hospitalization. C-reactive protein levels in both

groups showed gradual downward trend during hospitalization, however, that in NIV cases
descended to a lower level at a faster rate. ALT and D-dimer levels showed upward trends in both
groups during hospitalization, while, for total bilirubin and blood urea nitrogen, the upward trends
only occurs in IMV cases. The progressive decrease in LDH, IL-6 and IL-10 levels occurred in
NIV cases rather than IMV cases during hospitalization, and the levels were higher in IMV cases
than in NIV cases. (Fig 2 and Fig 3)

Discussion
We report a cohort of 34 ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,
characterised by severe or critical coronavirus pneumonia. 67.6% patients were men, with a
median age of 66 years (IQR 58-76) and the oldest patient, a 94 years old man has been
discharged. Of the 34 patients, 19 patients (55.9%) only received noninvasive respiratory support
(including nasal oxygen therapy in one case and HFNC in 18 patients) and 15 (44.1%) required
IMV. By the end of Mar 5 2020, the complications rate (including, acute liver injury, acute cardiac
injury and AKI) and discharge rate were significantly different between the two groups.
More than 100 COVID-19 patients were admitted to our designated hospital. Patients in
general isolation ward were mild to moderate, and most ICU patients without IMV required have
got better and discharged. However, the majority of ICU cases with IMV required are still under
respiratory support, including 11 ECMO operating. So, the main battlefield of the epidemic war is
in ICU, and the key to the success of the epidemic fighting is striving to improve and perfect the
management and treatment of severe and critical patients. Most common complication was ARDS
(33 [97.1%] of 34 patients) in the research, so, respiratory support is essential. By now, no
antiviral treatment has been proven to be eﬀective for coronavirus infection. 97.1% infected
patients received single or combined antiviral, including baloxavir, favipiravir, darunavir, arbidol,
or interferon alpha inhalation. Corticosteroid and gamma globulin were administrated to a part of
patient, but the efficacy needs to be further confirmed.
Most patients had neutrophilia in our cohort, which was consistent with the results of
Raymond et al in SARS-CoV infected patients [12]. As mentioned in previous studies for
critically ill patients with SARS-CoV [13], SARS-CoV-2 [14] and MERS [15, 16] infection,
lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature because targeted invasion by viral particles causes

lymphocyte destruction. Lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 60% patients in our cohort on
the first day of admission. As the disease progresses, more patients developed lymphocytopenia.
In the IMV group with more severe illness, lymphocyte levels dropped progressively and more
severe lymphopenia occurred compared to no-IMV group, which suggested that the severity of
lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the research of SARS-CoV
infected cases shows that patients with more severe clinical illness, or patients who died, had
significantly more profound lymphopenia [17]. The lymphocyte counts can gradually rise to
normal level until discharge in a part of patients without IMV in our cohort. Lymphopenia was
prolonged, and the lymphocyte returned towards normal after five weeks of illness in patients with
SARS-CoV [17] infection or within 2–3 weeks after the disease onset in cases with severe
pandemic H1N1 influenza A [18]. Further analysis in our cohort showed that T lymphocytopenia
was more pronounced than B lymphocytopenia which was similar to previous study in Patients
with SARS [19]. The mechanism behind the dynamics is not clear, which need to be confirmed in
cell and animal experiments.
We noted that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused increase in plasma IL-6 levels, which were
consistently at a high levels in IMV cases in our cohort. Early studies also have shown that
increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6, TNFα and IFNγ) in SARS
patients [20] and MERS-CoV cases [21]. Increased amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10,
in plasma was found in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with IMV, which diﬀers from SARS-CoV
infection [12], but supported by Huang et al. [8] in patients with the same disease. BUN is a key
element reflecting the intricate interrelation between nutritional status, protein metabolism and
renal situation of the patient [22]. BUN were significantly elevated in IMV patients compared
with NIV cases which may cause by high catabolism. The characteristics of inflammation and
metabolism, combined with lymphocytopenia, suggested that we have to be on the alert of the
existence of persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS) in
IMV cases. PICS, often leading to secondary infections and/or viral reactivation in the critically ill,
has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality [23-25].
This study has several limitations. Firstly, limited samples in our cohort are analyzed. A
previous report enrolled 52 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Wuhan Jin
Yin-tan hospital. However, in places outside Hubei province, the total number of cases and the

number of critical patients are relatively small. Secondly, most IMV patients had not been
discharged at the time of manuscript submission, so we can't use survival or death as a clinical end
point. The case mortality rate and other outcome indicators need to be reported later.

Conclusion
In this single-center case series of 34 ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infected in Hangzhou,
China, 97.1% of patients were complicated by ARDS, 44.1% received IMV, 55.9% only needed
noninvasive respiratory support. Compared with cases in NIV group, patients received IMV were
easier to complicate with organs injury, developed more severe lymphopenia, and had higher
inflammatory markers.
