the seeds. This indicates that the same enzymes regulate the
fatty acid composition of membrane and storage lipids. Such
an observation is consistent with our present understanding
of the biochemistry and cell biology of oilseed lipid biosynthesis (Stymne and Stobart, 1987; Browse and Somerville,

The fad2 mutants of Arabidopsis fhaliana are deficient in activity
of the endoplasmic reticulum oleate desaturase that is the main
enzyme responsible for polyunsaturated lipid synthesis in developing seeds of oil crops. A comparison of wild-type and fad2 seeds
developing on heterozygous (FADZl-) plants was used as a model
for genetically engineered high-oleate oilseeds of species such as
soybean and canola. When fad2 seeds developed at normal temperatures (22'C), they showed high viability compared to wildtype seeds. When a portion of seed development took place at
6'C, germination of the wild-type siblings remained high but germination of fad2 segregants declined considerably. This was true
even when exposure to low temperature was limited to the final
stages of seed filling and maturation. Compared to wild-type seeds,
fully viable fad2 seeds produced at 22°C had reduced lipid contents
and were slower to germinate at 10 and 6°C. Taken together, these
results indicate that for some oilseed species at least, molecular
genetic manipulation of oleate levels in the oil may result in plant
lines with unacceptable performance in the field.

1991).

Other changes in oil fatty acid composition have been
achieved through the isolation of genes encoding specific
enzymes of lipid metabolism and the application of molecular
genetic techniques to control the expression of these genes.
Examples include the seed-specific, antisense expression of
the 18:O-acyl carrier protein desaturase gene to increase the
levels of 18:O in seed oils of two Brassica species (Knutzon et
al., 1992) and the seed-specific expression of a medium-chain
acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase to produce 1 2 0 and 14:O
fatty acids in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus seeds
(Voelker et al., 1992). In several crop species, and also in
Arabidopsis, mutations that alter seed fatty acid composition
do bring about related changes in the membrane lipids of
vegetative tissues (Wang et al., 1989; Lemieux et al., 1990).
This means that specific molecular regulation of gene expression in seed tissues ( e g the use of seed-specific promoters to
control expression of antisense sequences)is an attractive and
possibly essential technique for producing modified seed oils
in some crop species.
Among the genes that are now available, the FAD2 gene
(Okuley et al., 1994) is of particular interest. The FAD2 gene
encodes the ER 18:l desaturase that controls the vast majority
of polyunsaturated lipid synthesis in plant cells. It is responsible for more than 90% of the polyunsaturated fatty acid
synthesis in nonphotosynthetic tissues, including the developing seeds of oil crops. Thus, mutant alleles at fad2 (or
constitutive antisense expression of FAD2 sequences) in soybean and in canola would considerably decrease the amount
of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetative tissues as well as
in the seed oil. Such changes in lipid composition do not
affect vegetative growth of Arabidopsis fad2 mutants at 22OC,
but the mutants are killed by low temperatures (Miquel et
al., 1993). The expression of an antisense FAD2 gene under
the control of a seed-specific promoter could alleviate the
problem of low-temperature sensitivity in the vegetative state
but does not preclude the alteration of membrane fatty acid
composition in the seed, since the FAD2 gene product is
responsible for desaturation of both membrane and storage
lipids (Browse and Somerville, 1991).
High-oleate sunflower varieties that were obtained by
chemical mutagenesis and mutation breeding are now in

Vegetable oils are increasingly important economically because they are widely used in human and animal diets and
in many industrial applications (Battey et al., 1989; Hills and
Murphy, 1991). However, the fatty acid compositionsof these
oils are often not optimal for many of these uses. Because
specialty oils with particular fatty acid compositions are
needed for both nutritional and industrial purposes, there
is considerable interest in modifying oil composition by
plant breeding or by using the new molecular tools of
biotechnology.
The mutation breeding approach has been successfully
applied to several species including linseed and sunflower to
increase the amount of specific fatty acids in the oil (Urie,
1985; Tonnet and Green, 1987; Ohlrogge et al., 1991). For
these species, the modification results from the presence of
at least one gene allele that disrupts the normal fatty acid
metabolism and leads to the accumulation of intermediate
products in the seed oil. In the examples just described, the
mutations affect only the seed fatty acid composition; vegetative tissues are completely unaffected. This suggests the
existence of seed-specificisozymes for at least some reactions
of fatty acid metabolism in these species. However, the
changes in fatty acid composition are not restricted to triacylglycerols but also affect glycolipids and phospholipids of

commercial production (Urie, 1985), indicating that, in this
species at least, eliminating polyunsaturated lipids from seed
tissues does not have any substantive effect on seed biology.
However, the membrane lipids from seeds of traditional
sunflower varieties contain no trienoic fatty acids and are
considerably less unsaturated than membrane lipids from
soybean and canola seeds (Appelqvist, 1971; Slack et al.,
1978; Garcés et al., 1989). This suggests that the production
of high-oleate sunflower lines might have been possible in
part because the biochemistry and physiology of the developing embryo is adapted to lower levels of membrane lipid
unsaturation.
It is important to know if seed development in other
engineered oilseed crops, which were modified to produce
high-oleate oils, would be affected by cold growing conditions (Murata and Nishida, 1990). This is a particular concem
for crops such as canola, which are usually grown in cool
climates. To study this problem, two approaches are possible.
One is to use transgenic plants in which the FAD2 gene is
expressed in an antisense orientation under the control of a
seed-specific promoter. The other approach, which we describe here, is a genetic one that relies on currently available
lipid mutants. Arabidopsis fad2 mutants have already provided useful information on the effect of cold growing conditions on the growth and development of the vegetative
plants (Miquel et al., 1993). In the experimentsreported here,
we investigated the development of fad2-2 and wild-type
seeds at 6OC. We demonstrate that the altered membrane
structures of fad2-2 cannot sustain the cellular processes
required for seed development at 6OC. Our results raise the
question of the viability of antisense expression of the FAD2
gene in commercial oil crops such as canola as a means to
increase the amount of oleate in the oil.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Material and Growth Conditions

The Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn fad2-2 mutant line was
kindly provided by Drs. D. James and H. Dooner (DNA Plant
Technologies, Oakland, CA) and was descended from the
Columbia wild type. It was isolated from an Mz population
obtained after mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate
(James and Dooner, 1990).
Surface-sterilized FAD2/- seeds were germinated on germination medium containing 3.1 g/L Gamborg’s salts, pH
5.7, 1%SUC,and 0.6% bacto-agar (Difco, Detroit, MI). The
plates were sealed with Micropore tape (3M). They were
placed at 6OC for 24 h, and then at 22OC under continuous
illumination (35 pmol m-’ s-’). Six days after sowing, seedlings were gently transferred to soil and grown under continuous illumination (120 pmol m-’ s-l) for 36 d. The plants
were then transferred to a cold room under the same illumination conditions. Air temperature was maintained at 6 k
l0C and soil temperatures at a depth of 2.5 cm were 7 f
0.5OC. Secondary floral stems were cut as they emerged.
Consequently,seeds developed entirely at 22OC or for various
times at 22OC followed by further development and maturation at 6OC. After they had reached maturity, seeds were
collected and dried over silica gel under a slight vacuum at
room temperature for at least 1 week prior to use.

Plant Physiol. Vol. 106, 1994

Determination of Germination Frequency

To determine the germination frequency, surf,ice-sterilized
seeds were germinated on germinationmedium. The medium
was the same as described above. The plates were placed at
22OC under very reduced light (8 pmol m-’s-’) for 48 h and
thereafter under continuous illumination (35 pmol m-’ s-’)
at 22OC for 2 to 4 weeks. If the experiment involved different
growth conditions, seeds from several siliques were pooled
and then randomly distributed to the treatments. Immediately after sowing, the plates were placed at the desired
temperature (22,10, or 6OC) under very reduced light (8 pmol
m-2
s-1 ) for 48 h and thereafter under continuous illumination (3,5 pmol m-’ s-’) at the same temperatui-e for 2 to 4
weeks.
Fatty Acid Analysis

The overall fatty acid composition of leaves, roots, or seeds
was determined as described by Miquel and Browse (1992).
To quantitate the fatty acids, an appropriate amount of 17:O
fatty acid was added as internal standard, artd fatty acid
methyl esters were then prepared and analyzed.
RESULTS
Mendelian Segregation after Self-Pollination of
Heterozygous fad2 Plants

The fad2 mutants of Arabidopsis have been characterized
as being deficient in activity of the ER 18:l desaturase that is
responsible for production of polyunsaturated lipids in the
eukaryotic pathway of lipid synthesis (Browse and Somerville, 1991; Miquel and Browse, 1992). Because the FAD2
gene product is the only ER 18:l desaturase in all tissues of
the plant including seeds (Okuley et al., 1994), the mutants
offer a genetic model in which to study the tbffect of low
temperature on seed development. To circumvent the eventual death of fad2-2 plants at low temperature (IMiquel et al.,
1993), we investigated seed development on F/iD2/- plants.
These heterozygous plants have a nearly wild-tjFe fatty acid
composition (Miquel and Browse, 1992) and, when grown at
low temperature, they are not distinguishable from wild-type
plants with regard to any aspect of plant development. Furthermore, after self-pollination, they should produce seeds
according to a Mendelian segregation so that each silique will
contain homozygous fad2-2 seeds along with heterozygous
and wild-type seeds.
Our experimentalprotocol is shown schematically in Figure
1. FAD2I- plants were grown from seeds at 22OC. When the
plants started to flower, floral buds on the mai’i floral stem
were examined at 12-h intervals to record which day each
flower opened. To simplify the cataloging and collecting of
seeds, secondary floral stems were trimmed as they appeared.
Under our growth conditions (22OC, 120 pmol m-’s-’ continuous illumination), three or four flowers opened each day
and 14 d elapsed between the opening of a flower and full
maturation of the resulting seeds. Consequently,when plants
were transferred to 6OC at 18 d after the first flower opened,
several siliques per plant were fully matured and had been
harvested. Further up the stem, siliques at diffexent stages of

maturation were present, followed by flowers and floral buds.
At 6OC, the plants continued to produce flowers and mature
seeds, although at a slower rate. By the end of the experiment,
about 65 siliques had been collected from each plant. These
spanned a range from siliques that had developed entirely at
22OC to siliques that had developed entirely at 6OC. The
seeds were classified according to extent of development at
22OC (days since anthesis) before transfer to 6OC.
To demonstrate that no distortion of the Mendelian segregation (for or against the fad2-2 allele) had occurred as a
result of the cold treatment, we first examined the distribution
of phenotypic classes in samples of seed collected at different
stages of the experiment. For seeds with between 14 and 5 d
of development at 22OC, the pattern of segregation was a
good fit to the 3:l hypothesis (Table I). For seeds with less
than 5 d of development at 22OC, the fatty acid analysis
failed to determine the genotype of a proportion of the seeds
(average 15%) due to their low lipid content. Nevertheless,
for the seeds of this group whose genotypes were identified,
the segregation pattern was also in agreement with the 3:l
hypothesis (data not shown), suggesting that there were no
factors in the experimental treatment that mediated against
the production of homozygous fad2-2 zygotes.
l o w Temperature Specifically Reduces the Viability of
Homozygous fad2 Seeds

We tested the germination of samples of seed that were at
different stages of maturity at the time of transfer to 6OC. At
the end of each experiment, the fatty acid compositions of
germinated seedlings and ungerminated seeds were determined by GC. Heterozygous FAD2/- seeds have a fatty acid
composition that is similar to that of the wild type (Lemieux
et al., 1990; Miquel and Browse, 1990) and, in our experi-

ments, their development and viability were indistinguishable from those of the wild type. Therefore, we pooled data
for heterozygous and wild-type individuals.
The results in Figure 2 show that germination of wild-type
and heterozygousseeds was only slightly affected by increasing time of development at 6OC. In contrast, homozygous
seeds showed substantially reduced germination even when
they had undergone 11 or 12 d (out of 14 d) of the maturation
process at 22OC before transfer to 6OC. Shorter periods of
development at 22OC were associated with very low germination percentages for the homozygous fad2-2 seeds. Fur-

thermore, for periods of less than 9 d at 22°C, a high
proportion of the homozygous mutant seeds that did germinate produced abnormal seedlings that were unable to develop into mature plants. These seeds were nevertheless
classified as having germinated.
The genotypes of approximately 15% of seeds with 0 to 4
d of development at 22°C could not be unequivocally determined. Therefore, we made the conservative assumption that
75% of the seeds whose genotypes were unknown were
either wild type or heterozygous at the fad! locus. The data
for 0 to 4 d in Figure 2 are calculated on this basis and they
show some reduction in the germination for the wild-type
plus heterozygous class. However, no homozygous fad2-2
plants were ever recovered from this group of seeds.
The viability of homozygous mutant seeds was reduced
even in the absence of any obvious effect on seed morphology. Figure 3A shows a random selection of seeds from
siliques that had undergone 9 d of maturation at 22°C before
transfer to 6°C. All the seeds appear to be fully mature; they
are plump and have the sculptured, darkened seed coat
typical of Arabidopsis seeds. More important, there is no visual
clue as to which seeds are homozygous for the fad2-2 mutation. However, when these seeds were incubated on germination medium, they faithfully reflected the data in Figure 2:
excellent germination of wild-type and heterozygous seeds
and germination of only one homozygous fad2-2 seed out of
four (Fig. 3B).
Mature Arabidopsis seeds require a period of dry storage to
ensure maximum germination (Koornneef et al., 1985). Dormancy of the seeds can also be broken by cold treatment. In
the experiments reported here, we stored seeds in a desiccator
over silica gel for at least 1 week before carrying out germi-

nation tests. To explore the possibility that dormancy of
homozygous fad2-2 seeds was not completely overcome by
dry storage, we performed an experiment in which seeds
from all developmental stages were prechilled (48 h at 6°C
in the dark) on germination medium before transfer to 22°C.
Such cold treatment during imbibition generally enhances
germination of fad2-2 seeds that have undergone development at 22°C but that have not been subject to postharvest
dry storage. Nevertheless, cold treatment of the seeds collected in this study had no appreciable effect on the germination percentages obtained for either homozygous or wildtype plus heterozygous seeds (data not presented). Low
concentrations of GAs have been shown to improve germination of Arabidopsis seeds under some conditions (Koornneef
et al., 1985). However, inclusion of 1 /IM each of GA4 and
GA7 in our germination medium also failed to make any
difference to the germination of fad2-2 seeds.
One possible explanation for the reduced germination of
fad2-2 seeds shown in Figure 2 would be that homozygous
mutant seeds fail to accumulate sufficient storage lipids at
low temperature to support subsequent germination. Incidental observations, such as the appearance of the seeds in Figure
3, argue against a substantial deficiency of storage lipids in
fad2-2 seeds as the primary determinant of their poor germination. However, all of the seeds that were collected from
siliques that had developed predominantly at 6°C (less than
6 d at 22°C) were reduced in size and shriveled relative to
the seeds shown in Figure 3. To address the question quantitatively, we measured the lipid content of individual seeds
from siliques that had been permitted from 13 to 0 d at 22°C
before transfer to 6°C. The data indicated that homozygous
fad2-2 seeds generally contained lower amounts of lipids

than wild-type and heterozygous seeds (Fig. 4). However,
mutant seeds from d 9 and 10 (average lipid content 3.3 pg)
showed only 16% germination, whereas wild-type plus heterozygous seeds from d O to 2 (average lipid content 1.3 pg)
showed an average of 63% germination. Thus, from the
results in Figure 4, it seems more likely that low oil content
is a consequence rather than a cause of the reduced viability
of fad2-2 seeds.

Fully Viable fad2-2 Seeds Show Reduced l i p i d Content
and Delayed Germination

The drastic effects of low temperature on development of
homozygous fad2-2 seeds prompted us to investigate the
consequences of the mutation for seeds that were allowed to
develop at 22OC. For this purpose, heterozygous fad2-2 plants
were grown and allowed to go to seed at a constant 22OC.
Siliques from different levels on the main floral stem were
collected at maturity. Secondary floral stems were cut as they
emerged. The lipid content and genotype of individual seeds
were determined by GC (Table 11). This analysis revealed that
homozygous fad2-2 seeds had a statistically significant 21 to
26% reduction in total fatty acid content when compared
with wild-type segregants from the same siliques. Heterozy-

425

gous seeds had an average oil content indistinguishable from
that of the wild type.
Samples of randomly selected seeds were incubated on
germination medium at 22,10, or 6OC. In these experiments,
all the seeds germinated and their genotypes were determined
by fatty acid analysis of the seedlings produced. At 22OC, the
seeds of all three segregating genotypes germinated within 2
d. The data showed a barely detectable delay in the germination of fad2-2 individuals (Fig. 5), and this is consistent
with our previous observations (Miquel et al., 1993). When
germination was camed out at 10°C, the process was delayed
but there was also a distinct difference of approximately 3 d
between the wild-type plus heterozygous seeds and the
homozygous mutant seeds. At 6OC, the effect of genotype
was even more evident. More than half of the wild-type plus
heterozygous individuals had germinated by d 12, whereas
50% germination was not achieved in the homozygous fad22 group until d 24. Almost all of the wild-type plus heterozygous seeds had germinated (d 15) before the first of the
homozygous seeds. These results again demonstrate the
strong influence of the fad2-2 mutation on the temperaturedependent physiology of the seeds.

DISCUSSION

Vegetable oils containing a very high proportion of 18:l
and correspondingly low proportions of polyunsaturated
fatty acids are desirable commodities, and high-oleic sunflower varieties are now grown commercially in the U.S. and
elsewhere. In these commercial varieties, the fatty acid composition of the seed oil was altered without any effect on the
lipids of vegetative tissues (Garcés et al., 1989). Extensive
efforts to breed comparable high-oleic lines of the more
widely grown oil crops, soybean and canola, have not been
successful. In oilseeds, most of the desaturation of 18:l to
polyunsaturated fatty acids is mediated by an ER 18:l desaturase that in Arabidopsis is encoded by the fad2 locus. Thus,
the recent cloning of the FAD2 gene (Okuley et al., 1994)
may provide the basis for the production of high-oleate
soybean and canola lines through genetic engineering. Previous studies of the Arabidopsis fad2 mutants have shown

that vegetative tissues require activity of the ER 18:l desaturase for survival at low temperatures (Miquel et al., 1993),
and this observation raised the question of how seed tissues
might be affected by down-regulation of the enzyme. Inhibition of FAD2 expression specifically in oil-accumulating
cells would provide the minimum possible disruption to the
biology of the plant. However, in these cells the fatty acid
compositions of both triacylglycerols and membrane phospholipids would be altered.
In the work reported here, our goal was to use fad2 mutants
of Arubidopsis to determine how seed physiology might be
affected by such manipulation of seed fatty acid composition.
One attraction of this approach is that experimental (jud2/
fad2) and control (wild-type) seeds were produced in the
same siliques and therefore can be assumed to have been
subject to identical conditions of nutrient supply and environment during their development. However, our results
cannot be a definitive prediction of how genetically modified
crops will be affected under field conditions. An important
consideration in this respect is that the jud2-2 mutation will
affect every cell of the developing embryo. The use of an
oleosin (Cummins et al., 1993) or seed storage protein
(Knutzon et al., 1992) promoter to control expression of an
antisense FAD2 sequence could confine inhibition of desaturase activity to the oil-accumulating cells of the cotyledons.
Cells of other tissues such as the shoot and root meristems
might exhibit normal levels of unsaturation in their membrane lipids.
We do not know to what extent our results reflect changes
in these other tissues, but in light of the broad-ranging
consequencesof the jud2 mutations on temperature responses
in different tissues (Miquel et al., 1993), it is unlikely that
cell-specific antisense expression could alleviate all of the
problems identified in this study. For example, the reduced
oil content of the jud2-2 segregant seeds compared with their
siblings would certainly seem to reflect metabolism in the
triacylglycerol-accumulatingcells of the cotyledons. It is also
pertinent that wembmitted our plants to a constant, 6OC
temperature regime during seed development. Such conditions are far more extreme than would be experienced by
oilseed crops under field conditions. Finally, less than 100%
inhibition of FAD2 expression might greatly reduce the effects
of low temperature on seed development because vegetative
tissues of a leaky allele of fad2 (fud2-1) are not killed at 6OC
(Miquel et al., 1993). A sophisticated variation on this approach would be to engineer low-temperature-induced
expression of a heterologous 18:l desaturase (that is, one that
would escape antisense control) in seed tissues (or oil-accumulating cells) that were not expressing the endogenous
desaturase. Again, experience with the fud2-1 allele indicates
that such a strategy might substantially alleviate the detrimental effects on cell metabolism of the deficiency in 18:l
desaturation (Miquel et al., 1993). However, any significant
activity of the 18:l desaturase would raise the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the seed oil and potentially reduce
the oil's value.
Notwithstanding these caveats, the data presented here
indicate that any complete inhibition of the expression of the
FAD2 gene in oil-accumulating cells may adversely affect the

temperatures may curtail seed development and reduce subsequent germination. Even at normal temperatu~es,it is possible that the lipid content of the seeds will be reduced, and
this effect could be reflected in lowered oil yitilds. Finally,
even fully viable seeds might suffer a significimt delay in
germination at temperatures below 10°C. Any reduction in
the rate of germination is a potential problem 1 1 field crops
because it provides an extended opportunity fclr insect and
pathogen attack.
There are many genes of lipid metabolism that may be
used to successfully alter the fatty acid composiions of seed
oils (Ohlrogge, 1994). However, in the case of the FAD2 gene
studied here, production of the commercially desirable oil,
one with the highest possible oleate content, may not be
possible.
