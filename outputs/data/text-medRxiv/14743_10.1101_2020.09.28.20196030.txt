INTRODUCTION

44

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered

45

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). Within three months of its

46

emergence in China in December 2019, COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic by the

47

World Health Organisation (WHO). As of October 29, 2020, nearly 45 million COVID-19 cases

48

and 1.2 million deaths have been reported worldwide (3–5). Accurate diagnosis is essential in

49

managing the pandemic, not only to identify, isolate and treat affected patients, but also to

50

characterize the epidemiology of virus transmission and develop national and international

51

surveillance programs. WHO recommends molecular testing of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids for

52

acute-phase diagnosis of suspected cases (6–8). Several nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs),

53

mostly based on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), have

54

received the Conformité Européenne (CE) mark and have been approved by the United States

55

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under emergency use authorization (EUA) (9–11). On the

56

other hand, serological testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, especially immunoglobulin M

diagnosis of acute cases. It plays however an essential role in the diagnosis of past SARS-CoV-2

59

infection and in ongoing immunological and epidemiological surveillance. Serological testing

might also complement molecular testing to confirm suspected cases not detected by molecular

65

specificity should be well defined for the target population and validated at different post-

66

infection time windows. Specificity is particularly critical in the current pandemic phase, as

67

seroprevalence in the population is still low. In such low-incidence settings, a specificity > 99%

68

and a narrow 95% confidence interval (95% CI) are required to ensure a high positive predictive

69

value (PPV) (11, 19, 20). Accordingly, the antigens used to design serology tests should be

70

properly selected and cross-reactivity with antibodies directed against other antigens, including

71

from other coronaviruses, should be verified. A huge number of serology assays have been

72

developed and marketed in the last few months, of which 56 received FDA’s EUA (as of October

73

29, 2020) (21, 22). Clinical performance data of commercial tests are still scant, and examples of

74

poorly performing tests have even been reported (9). Therefore, there is an urgent need for well

75

validated and performant serology tests, notably demonstrating very high specificity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

83

Patients and samples.

84

SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were collected after approval by the Ethics Committee RCB 2020-

85

A00932-37.

86

pandemic samples (from healthy subjects and from donors with other medical conditions) were

87

collected in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013. Collected sera and

88

plasma were stored frozen (< -20°C) until further testing.

89

Serum from up to 989 healthy pre-pandemic adult donors collected before September 2019 at

90

two geographical sites (Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS), France; Clinilabs, Inc., United

91

States) were used to determine the assay specificity of the VIDAS® SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and

92

combined IgM/IgG test (defined as negative if both VIDAS® SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG assays are

93

negative).

94

For the evaluation of the positive percent agreement (PPA), 405 serum or plasma samples from

95

142 symptomatic patients (60 hospitalized, 61 non-hospitalized, 21 of unknown hospitalization

96

status) diagnosed with COVID-19 and confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by molecular testing

Briefly, a solid-phase receptacle coated with the antigen (recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor-

125

binding domain [RBD] of the viral Spike protein) serves as both solid phase and pipetting device.

126

After the sample dilution step, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG are captured on the coated

127

antigen and unbound components are washed out. In a second step, human IgM (VIDAS® SARS-

128

CoV-2 IgM) or IgG (VIDAS® SARS-CoV-2 IgG) are specifically detected by mouse monoclonal

129

antibodies

130

respectively. Unbound components are eliminated by washing and detection is performed by

131

incubation with the substrate (4-Methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate) followed by measurement of

132

the fluorescent product (4-Methyl-umbelliferone) at 450 nm. A relative fluorescence value (RFV)

is generated (background reading subtracted from the final fluorescence reading). The assay is

139

values for the IgM and IgG tests were determined from a healthy pre-pandemic cohort (259

Analytical performance of VIDAS

176

Within-run and within-laboratory precisions of the ELFA-based tests were determined using

177

three samples (one negative and two positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG). Samples were run in

178

triplicate on one VIDAS® instrument, twice a day over 10 days (with an instrument calibration

179

every second day), using one assay lot, thus generating 60 measurement values per sample. The

180

coefficient of variation (%CV) for repeatability (within-run precision) did not exceed 9.3% and

181

5.9% for the VIDAS

182

precision was also low, reaching a maximum of 10.7% and 6.9% for the VIDAS

262

on hospitalized patients (Table 2).

263

Based on the specificity and the PPA determined on paired IgM and IgG testing (N=308 for

264

specificity; N=105 for PPA), the negative predictive value (NPV) and the positive predictive value

265

(PPV) were calculated at 5% prevalence (22), according to the time after symptom onset (Table

266

alone or in combination; NPV was ≥ 96.5% (lower 95% confidence limits ≥ 95.4%) at 0-7 days

268

post symptom onset and NPV increased from 99.1% to 100.0% (lower 95% confidence limits ≥

269

98.0%) from day 8 onwards following symptom onset. The PPV of the VIDAS

assay was 100% at all time frames considered. Of note, the PPV calculated using the full data set

272

from 94.3% at 0-7 days to 98.1% at ≥ 32 days (Table S7). The PPV of the VIDAS

assay was lower, ranging from 72.1% at 0-7 days to 89.0% from day 16 onwards following

274

symptom onset (Table 5). The combination of IgM and IgG test results slightly improved the PPV

DISCUSSION

305
®

306

We describe here the analytical and clinical performance of the VIDAS

307

assays. We demonstrate that both assays show high precision, and excellent analytical and

308

clinical performances.

309

The rate of cross-reactivity with non-specific antibodies, including those of patients infected

310

with other coronaviruses, was very low in both VIDAS

311

weak cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses antibodies is likely due, at least in part, to the

312

choice of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike protein as SARS-CoV-2-specific

313

antigen. The RBD shows a high sensitivity in ELISA, higher than that of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1

314

or nucleocapsid

315

structural divergences with the RBD of other coronaviruses (34–36). Another advantage of using

316

the RBD is that the viral antigen generates neutralizing antibodies likely to provide protective

317

immunity (35–42), as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV (43, 44). That the VIDAS

321

Beside its strong immunogenicity and antigenicity, the RBD of SARS-CoV has been shown to

322

elicit

323

possibility that it might also be the case for the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies in COVID-19

memory lymphocytes (48), as well as the stability of the IgG response detected with the VIDAS

327

SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay up to 74 days post-symptom onset in the present study, strongly support

328

this proposition. Hence, a serology test such as the VIDAS

329

suitable for the detection of protective immunity and the evaluation of the efficacy of future

330

vaccines, which are mainly based on the RBD-containing Spike protein (49, 50).

331

The low cross-reactivity rate with non-specific sera probably explains the very high specificity (≥

332

99%) and narrow 95% CI of both VIDAS

IgM/IgG tests early after symptom onset might also be useful for the diagnosis of suspected

COVID-19 cases with negative PCR (13–15, 17, 18).

In conclusion, VIDAS® SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG are highly sensitive and specific assays for the

377

when available). Moreover, the VIDAS® SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay fulfils the specificity requirement

378

for its use in seroepidemiology studies and is well suited for the detection of past SARS-CoV-2

infections. Further studies are necessary to confirm its suitability for the detection of SARS-CoV-
