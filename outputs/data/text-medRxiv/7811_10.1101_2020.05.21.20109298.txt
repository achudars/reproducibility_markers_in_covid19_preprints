The current COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on the world. As

have been infected, and over 250,000 of them have died. This is the first
pandemic in human history that has been tracked on a daily basis across the
world. Currently, progress is being tracked by a series of metrics, including new
cases, deaths, and the effective reproduction number over time (R(t)), which
epidemiologists have emphasized.
While it is an important measure, R(t) is not observable and is dependent on
the absolute number of active cases; therefore, two geographies could have a
similar R(t) but be having very different experiences. Here, we propose a metric
to monitor progress on addressing the COVID pandemic that we name “progress
to zero” or P0. P0 corresponds to the percentage decline from a previously
recorded peak level. The metric ranges from 0% (representing a geography that
has not yet peaked) to 100% (representing a geography wherein 0 cases have
been recorded for at least seven days). Our metric helps leaders focus on progress
to a desired goal, easily can be tracked over time, can quickly identify retreat
from progress, and is comparable across geographies regardless of their size.

Introduction
Objectively evaluating progress on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic will require
multiple metrics, including cases, deaths, testing capacity, and hospitalizations over
time. [1]. One metric that epidemiologists focus on is the change in effective reproductive number over time (R(t)) [2].
Epidemiologists argue that tracking R(t) is a way to manage the COVID-19
crisis [3–6]. R(t) conveys whether the number of cases is growing (R(t)>1), has
plateaued (R(t)~1), or is declining (R(t)<1).

However, R(t) is a blunt metric that misses nuance. R(t) is interpretable, but
it is not observable: it must be estimated from the available data on confirmed
cases over time. Further, because different geographies have different individual,
biological, and environmental factors, R(t) may not be comparable across different
geographic settings.
For example, on May 5th 2020, the R(t) for the United States (US), the United
Kingdom (UK), and Australia were all near 1, suggesting that the number of cases
had plateaued. [1] Nevertheless, the lived experience of the three countries on May
8th was very different [7] (Figure 1). While US and UK cases had plateaued near
the peak number of cases but continued with large absolute numbers of new cases,
Australia, had fewer than 20 new cases per day and had several 0 death days [8].
Similarly, while R(t) was similar in Hungary and Argentina on May 8th, the trajectory of new cases was very different (Figure 2).
Clearly, the relevance of an R>1 depends on the absolute number of active cases.
In the absence of knowing the absolute numbers of cases, it is difficult to derive
conclusions from an R(t) graphic.

Methods
Here, we propose an additional metric for leaders to measure success in addressing
the COVID-19 crisis: progress to zero (P0). This is defined as the percentage decline
from a previously recorded peak level.
P0 at time i is defined one minus the ratio of A(i) to B(i), where A is the 7-day
moving average of new cases ending at day i and B is the 7-day moving average of
new cases corresponding to the historic peak. While the measure could be defined
using a shorter moving average interval or using a weighted moving average, we use
a simple 7-day moving average to illustrate its calculation and use.
Because the measure would not be stable with small numbers of cases, we recommend limiting measure application to geographies with at least 100 COVID-19
cases confirmed within a region.
Defining a 7-day moving average of cases and i as the current day, the calculations
are provided below:

[1]ma(j) =

j
1 X
newcases[k]
7
k=j−6

[2]P 0(i) = 1 −

ma(i)
maxj (ma(7), . . .., ma(i))

Results
As an example, applying this metric on May 8th, 2020, demonstrates considerable
progress disparity across Australia, the US, the UK, Hungary, and Argentina (Table
1).
Effectively, the measure suggests that there is no progress if the number of cases
has not peaked, 100% progress if there are zero cases for at least one week, and
intermediate progress (which is comparable across geographies) if the number of
cases is declining. Particularly in anticipation of the ongoing growth of viral spread
and multiple potential waves, it is important to recognize that a country could peak
several times. With each new peak, the metric will reset, with the global peak being
the new baseline (Figure 3 gives an example).
The measure also captures the importance of controlling the growth of cases. As
of April 1, 2020, Australia had 200 new cases per day, similar to that of Argentina

Figure 3 Australia new COVID-19 [5] cases and progress to zero (P0)

had as of May 1st. However, progress for Australia was 50%, while Argentina’s
progress was zero. Independent of the number of new cases that a country has, as
long as the country cannot reduce them, cases will continue to grow, making future
control more challenging. On the other hand, if a country has learned how to reduce
the development of new cases, absent policy changes, control of case spread should
continue.

Measuring Deaths, cases, and hospitalizations
Using data from the European Center for Disease Control, [4] as of May 8, 2020,
only 5 countries had made at least 95% progress towards 0 cases using our metric
(China, South Korea, Thailand, Israel, and Switzerland) (Figure 5). Disconcertingly,
30 countries have made less than 5% progress and may not have reached their global
peak yet.
