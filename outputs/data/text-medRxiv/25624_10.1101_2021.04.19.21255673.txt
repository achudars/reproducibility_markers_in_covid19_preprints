policymakers with the aid of an interactive app. These discussions guided modelling of lockdown

interventions depended heavily on compliance. Assuming 80% compliance, symptoms-based
household quarantining alone could not prevent hospitalisations exceeding capacity, whilst maskwearing prevented overwhelming health services and was cost-effective given masks of high
filtration efficiency. Combining masks with quarantine increased their impact. Even at maximum
testing capacity, confirmed cases far underestimate total cases. Recalibration to surging cases in
2021 suggests potential for another wave later in 2021, dependent on uncertainties in case
reporting and immunity.

decision-making, with mask-wearing being mandated early, and community teams being deployed
to support quarantining across Dhaka. These measures likely contributed to averting the worst
public health impacts, but delivering an effective response at scale has been challenging. Messaging
to increase compliance with mask-wearing and quarantine is needed to reduce the risk and impacts
from another wave.

Human infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that
causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, were first observed in China in December 2019 (Li et al.,
2020). By the end of 2020, more than 80.3 million cases and 1.77 million associated deaths had
been reported worldwide (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2021). With limited
treatment options, countries turned to a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to limit
transmission. These measures include improved hygiene practices, social distancing, contact tracing,
travel restrictions, quarantines, shielding of the vulnerable, lockdowns of differing severity, and
facemasks. NPIs have been used by high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) alike, but for a variety of reasons some of these measures may be less effective or
more difficult to maintain in LMICs. Vaccines have come into play in 2021, but rollout has been
almost exclusively in HICs. With negligible vaccination coverage and only NPIs to mitigate impacts,
LMICs are now facing subsequent epidemic waves of faster-spreading variants and may have little
protective immunity from prior infections (Cele et al., 2021; Planas et al., 2021).

Lockdowns can control COVID-19 epidemics by reducing the effective reproduction number, Re , to
below one (Flaxman et al., 2020). However, where many people live precariously without social
support, lockdowns can exacerbate poverty (Amewu et al., 2020; Andam et al., 2020) and risk food
security, whilst poor adherence limits their effectiveness. Social distancing may be impractical in
densely populated areas (Anwar et al., 2020; Chowdhury et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020), hindered
by larger household sizes and/or cramped conditions (Davies et al., 2020a). Urban slums and
refugee camps, where rapid transmission and poor healthcare access co-occur, present a particular
concern (Ahmed et al., 2020; Truelove et al., 2020). Shielding the most vulnerable, primarily older
people and those with underlying health conditions (Clark et al., 2020), is also challenging in multigenerational households (Hodgins and Saad, 2020; Lloyd-Sherlock et al., 2020; United Nations,
Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019a). Contact tracing is limited by testing capabilities
(facilities, trained personnel, consumables, reagents and biosafety) (Anwar et al., 2020; Homaira et
al., 2020; Rahaman et al., 2020) and information management capacity. Moreover, in settings
where healthcare resources are already stretched, surge capacity is also low (Torres-Rueda et al.,
2020).

Some features of LMICs may mitigate the health costs of any lowered efficiency of NPIs. The
relatively younger populations in LMICs, with fewer underlying risk factors, means that a smaller
proportion of cases are likely to be severe relative to HICs (Clark et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020;
Hodgins and Saad, 2020). There has been speculation that the BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin)
vaccine, which is no longer routinely used in HICs, but is widely used in LMICs, may confer some
protection from severe COVID-19, but evidence from trials is needed to confirm any association
(Pereira et al., 2020). More generally, the wider social and economic consequences of NPIs may
trade off against their impact on controlling disease, and the structure and underlying health of
populations may impact the shape of this trade-off (Reidpath et al., 2020). Hence, there is an urgent
need for the development and implementation of contextually appropriate interventions that take
into account the population that they target and their needs (Hodgins and Saad, 2020).

During the pandemic, epidemiological models have received increased attention from governments
and the public alike, and have influenced policy decisions worldwide (McBryde et al., 2020).
However, a translational gap persists between policymakers and scientists working on models for
disease forecasting and assessment of interventions. Early in the pandemic, this gap was
exacerbated by uncertainties about the biology and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the limited
information about its spread, given local testing and reporting capacities, not to mention people’s
behaviour. As a consequence, there is often simultaneously both overconfidence in, and mistrust of,
models.

Ideally, policymakers, scientists and communities should work together to develop and implement
locally appropriate interventions. Models can play an important and overlooked role in facilitating
this process. By empowering decision-makers to better understand the mechanisms underpinning
the timescales and magnitude over which interventions lead to impact, as well as the uncertainties
and social and behavioural factors that affect their efficacy, co-created models can inform short- and
longer-term policies.

We investigate the potential impact of contextually appropriate NPI strategies to mitigate COVID-19
in Dhaka District, Bangladesh. High-density urban centres and refugee camps in Bangladesh led to
fears that strained health systems would be quickly overwhelmed (Anwar et al., 2020). Cases of
COVID-19 were first confirmed in Bangladesh on the 8th March 2020, and NPIs were subsequently
introduced, beginning with postponements to mass gatherings, followed by international travel
restrictions, and culminating in a national lockdown (announced as a ‘general holiday’) from 26th
March (Ahmed et al., 2020; Anwar et al., 2020). Rapid movement out of urban areas, particularly
from the capital city Dhaka, following the lockdown announcement led to virus spread across the
country (Anwar et al., 2020). The lockdown had swift economic repercussions: around 60% of
households lost their main income source, the majority of previously vulnerable non-poor
households slipped below the poverty line, and food security declined (Rahman et al., 2020). The
nationwide lockdown was quickly recognized as untenable long-term (ultimately ending on 1st June),
and considered only as a stop-gap measure.

With input from policymakers, we developed an SEIR model to compare the potential of NPIs
following the relaxation of lockdown. We designed an associated interactive app within which
policymakers could explore these scenarios to gain an understanding of how the model worked and
how uncertainties may influence outcomes. Here we compare scenarios based on projected 2020
COVID-19 deaths, and whether hospitalisations remain below capacity. We also explore associated
costs and the importance of having NPIs in place by the time lockdown ends. Finally, we examine
scenarios following resurgence of cases and a renewed lockdown in March 2021 and update our app
for ongoing policy use.

Model description

122
123
124
125
126

We developed a deterministic SEIR model comprising a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Dhaka District, the most densely populated district in
Bangladesh. Dhaka District includes rural areas in addition to the city area itself, but, as case data
were resolved to district level, we consider the full district population, rather than restricting
analyses to the city population.

127
128

The model includes three infectious states, with latently infected individuals either becoming presymptomatically infectious ( I p ) before progressing to symptomatic infection ( I s ), or becoming

129

asymptomatically infectious ( I a ) until their recovery (Fig. 1). Susceptible individuals are exposed to

130
131
132
133
134

SARS-CoV-2 according to transmission rates specific to each infectious state ( β a , β p and β s ).
These rates are based on: 1) asymptomatic individuals producing 65% of the secondary infections
produced by pre-symptomatic-to-symptomatic individuals (Yi et al., 2020); 2) 35% of secondary
infections from pre-symptomatic-to-symptomatic individuals happening in the pre-symptomatic
period (Liu et al., 2020); and 3) the value of R0 :

where d a = 7 , d p = 2 and d s = 7 are the mean durations (in days) of each infectious state (Byrne et
al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020), and f a is the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic
(supplementary Table S4). Recovered individuals are considered to be immune.

We track numbers of both general and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds required by COVID-19
patients, and deaths due to COVID-19 (Fig. 1). A proportion of individuals f H 1 − f ICU that leave

the pre-symptomatic state join a holding category prior to progressing to general hospital beds,
while a second proportion f H f ICU enters a holding category prior to entering ICU beds. Individuals
remain in these two holding categories from the first appearance of symptoms until the point at
which hospitalisation is required, on average 7 days (Liang et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020). A third
holding category retains a proportion of individuals f D from the first appearance of symptoms until
death, on average 20.2 days later (Linton et al., 2020; Verity et al., 2020). While we assume no
overlap between the groups in ICU versus general hospital beds, overlap between those that die and
the hospitalized groups is both permitted and expected. On leaving hospital, after a mean of 5 days
for general beds and 7 days for ICU (Rees et al., 2020), recovered individuals recuperate for an
average of 3 weeks before resuming work, if employed (Halpin et al., 2020). The number of
individuals in the seven health outcome states has no impact on transmission dynamics, and it is
assumed that there is no impact of a lack of hospital beds on the COVID-19 death rate. This
approach to modelling health outcomes is similar to that described in several other COVID-19
models (Davies et al., 2020b; Keeling et al., 2020).

We use data on the age structure of the Dhaka population (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics,
2011) (supplementary Table S1) to inform parameters describing the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Previously estimated age-specific risk of death due to COVID-19, of hospitalisation for symptomatic
cases (Davies et al., 2020b), and of developing symptoms (Davies et al., 2020a) (supplementary Table
S2), were combined with the age distribution in Dhaka District, to estimate the overall proportions of
1) asymptomatic infections, f a = 0.701 , 2) symptomatic infections that lead to death, f D = 0.009 ,

161

and 3) symptomatic infections requiring hospitalisation, f H = 0.073 . Of those hospitalised we

162
163

assume that the proportion requiring critical care in an ICU is f ICU = 0.31 (World Health
Organisation (WHO), 2020a). We assumed no age-structure in contacts within our model.

The model was initially developed as an interactive epidemiological teaching tool
(http://boydorr.gla.ac.uk/BGD_Covid-19/CEEDS/), to allow policymakers to explore the impact of
interventions on health outcomes and working days lost. For speed and efficiency, and given the
large population (Dhaka District population in 2020 is around 13.8 million (Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics, 2011; United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019b)), the decision
was made to make the model deterministic rather than stochastic. We minimise computational
complexity by modelling transmission at the population level rather than at the level of the
individual or household. However, to more accurately model household quarantining, we further
subdivide the six disease states (Fig. 1) to track within-household transmission and account for
household-level susceptible depletion (Supplement A).

We implemented three main NPIs – lockdown, household quarantining delivered through
Community Support Teams (CSTs), and mask wearing – that were considered to be feasible by
policymakers in Bangladesh. For each intervention we considered timing of implementation, scaling
up and levels of compliance. In real-time we explored these interventions with policymakers
including the lockdown duration, however here we model lockdown as implemented (26th March to
1st June 2020) and consider additional lockdown extensions, which, despite their impracticality,
allow comparison to more feasible scenarios.

We define a lockdown as a scenario where all except essential workplaces are closed,
including educational facilities, and people are asked to stay home where possible and practice
social distancing. For compliant individuals and those that are not essential workers, this
intervention is assumed to reduce contacts, and therefore transmission, outside of the household by
the proportion ε ld , while leaving within-household transmission unchanged. We achieve this by
breaking down the transmission rates for the three infectious states into within- and betweenhousehold components using estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate,
σ = 0.166 (Madewell et al., 2020), and the mean household size, η = 4 (Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics, 2016). We considered a scale-up period for the lockdown, during which compliance
increased linearly from zero to a maximum. Following scale-up, we assume compliance starts to
decline exponentially towards a minimum. Full details of implementation are given in Supplement A.

Under the household quarantine intervention, when a symptomatic individual occurs, that
individual’s entire household is required to quarantine for 14 days. Those who develop symptoms
can self-report to a national COVID-19 hotline or are identified by word-of-mouth, triggering a visit
by CST, a volunteer workforce of community-based support workers trained by BRAC/FAO. The CST
confirm that symptoms are syndromically consistent with COVID-19, provide information on how to
limit spread, facilitate access to healthcare, and offer support to aid quarantine compliance, with
additional follow-up during the quarantine period.

Modelling household quarantine requires us to both identify both those individuals that
trigger quarantining (the first symptomatic individuals within households), and other individuals in
their households who also undergo quarantine. We subdivide the disease states to identify those
not currently in an infected household, those in a non-quarantined infected household, and those in
a quarantined household. When a susceptible individual in an uninfected household becomes
latently infected (through between-household transmission), η − 1 other individuals also move from
uninfected household categories into categories that identify them as being in a non-quarantined
infected household, making them vulnerable to both within-household and between-household
transmission. We track the group of individuals who were the first infected within a household
separately to those who subsequently became infected, allowing us to observe when household
index cases become symptomatic. A proportion of these symptomatic index cases comply with
quarantine, taking η − 1 individuals from non-quarantined infected households with them. We also
trigger quarantines when within-household cases resulting from index asymptomatic cases become
symptomatic. The equations generating these dynamics are described in Supplement A. Infectious
individuals within quarantined households are assumed to not cause any between-household
transmission. As with lockdown, household quarantining with CST support has defined start and end
times, and the proportion of households that comply increases linearly through a scale-up period,
after which compliance remains at a constant maximum (see Supplement A).

228
229
230

Finally, we considered compulsory mask-wearing outside of the household. Within the
model, masks are assumed to block a proportion, ε m , of between-household transmission from
compliant individuals, while also blocking a proportion, ε m ρ m , of transmission to compliant

231
232
233
234

individuals, where 0 ≤ ρ m ≤ 1 , i.e. masks protect others from the wearer, and the wearer from
others, to different degrees, with protection provided to the wearer never greater than that
provided to others (Howard et al., 2020; Stutt et al., 2020). The full description of mask wearing
effects, in relation to timing and compliance is provided in the Supplement A.

We model working days lost due to both illness and interventions. Based on the 2011
census (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2011), we assume 52% of the population is formally
employed, working five days a week. We model symptomatic and recuperating individuals to be offsick, and assume that deaths result in loss of all subsequent working days through 2020. During
lockdown, those workers that are both compliant and not essential workers lose their working days.
Those in quarantined households do not work, and, since household quarantine is based on
symptoms, we assume that, in addition to those quarantined due to COVID-19, a proportion of
households affected by non-COVID-19 influenza-like illnesses also undergo quarantine. Based on the
2011 census, 23% of the population is unemployed, but works within the household, e.g. with caring
responsibilities (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2011). When these individuals are hospitalised or
die, we assume another (possibly formally employed) household member replaces them, leading to
further loss of working days. Finally we assume that, in response to each death, a number of
grieving individuals (taken to be η − 1 ) do not work for a week. Details of the working days lost

calculation are provided in equations S.16-17.

Scenario comparison

250
251

With input from policy-makers, we explored 15 combinatorial scenarios for 2020, including a
baseline with no interventions and unmitigated SARS-CoV-2 spread.

252
253
254
255
256
257

The first of four lockdown-only scenarios aimed to replicate the lockdown as implemented,
from 26th March until 1st June 2020. The other three lockdown-only scenarios involved extending
the lockdown by 1, 2 and 3 months. In all four scenarios we assume scale-up occurs over one week,
with peak compliance of 80%, declining towards 30% (supplementary Fig. S1D); considered to be
qualitatively similar to practice in Dhaka. The impact of lockdown on between-household
transmission of compliant individuals ε ld was estimated during model calibration (see below).

258
259

261
262
263
264

We also examined scenarios where lockdown, as implemented in Bangladesh, was followed
by either CST interventions, compulsory mask-wearing or both, beginning a week before lockdown
ended and continuing through 2020 with a 7-day scale-up period and 80% peak compliance with
each intervention. The ability of masks both to protect others from transmission from the wearer
and to protect the wearer from transmission from others depends on several variables, including the
material used, the construction (e.g. layers of material), and the quality of fit (Aydin et al., 2020;
Davies et al., 2013; Howard et al., 2020). Therefore, for mask-wearing we consider scenarios where
there is low, medium, and high protection of others from the wearer ( ε m = {0.2,0.5,0.8} ), and
where the protection provided to the wearer is zero, half that provided to others, or equal to that
provided to others ( ρ m = {0,0.5,1} ), giving nine mask-wearing scenarios.

For the 2020 time horizon we compared the total: 1) hospitalisations, 2) deaths, 3)
percentage of patient days exceeding hospital capacity (the sum of patients in excess of hospital
beds each day, divided by the summed total patients over all days), 4) working days lost, 5) cost of
implementing interventions and of healthcare for COVID-19 patients, 6) cost per death averted
(relative to no intervention), and 7) the percentage return (in terms of healthcare savings) on
investment (%ROI) in interventions. For estimating total cost we include healthcare provision for
hospitalised COVID-10 patients, media campaigns, training and deployment of CSTs, and mask
distribution, as detailed in Table 1. For each scenario, we used the total cost to estimate the cost per
death averted. This was calculated by subtracting the cost of the baseline scenario from that of the
focal scenario, then dividing by the reduction in deaths from the baseline. The %ROI for each
scenario was calculated by subtracting the total cost of each scenario from the baseline, and dividing
by the intervention implementation costs (i.e. the sum of all costs other than hospital care).

Given the heavy societal and economic costs of lockdowns, they are typically viewed as
temporary measures to buy time for implementation of other less restrictive measures (e.g. mask
wearing) or more targeted measures (e.g. household quarantines and contact tracing). To explore
the impact of preparedness prior to lockdown ending, we examined the sensitivity of model
outcomes (hospitalisations, deaths, working days lost, and exceeded hospital capacity) to the scaleup period and start date of post-lockdown interventions. Modelling lockdown as implemented in
Bangladesh, we looked at scenarios where lockdown was followed by household quarantining only,
mask-wearing only (assuming mask protectiveness parameters ε m = 0.5 and ρ m = 0.5 ), or both.
We varied the start date of the post-lockdown intervention(s) from 30 days pre- to 30 days postlockdown ending, while keeping the scale-up period constant at 7 days, and vice versa varying the
scale-up period (zero to 30 days), while keeping the start constant (7 days prior to the lockdown
end).

We calibrated two parameters, R0 and ε ld , the proportion by which lockdown reduces betweenhousehold transmission from compliant people, against daily COVID-19 death data in Bangladesh
(European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020). We chose to calibrate against reported
deaths rather than cases, since death data are less affected by testing and reporting capacity. To
obtain a time-series of deaths in Dhaka District, we extracted the proportion of district-resolved case
totals for Dhaka District from Bangladesh’s COVID-19 dashboard (“Coronavirus COVID-19 Dashboard,
2020,” 2020) and assumed this proportion remained constant. The first three cases in Bangladesh
were confirmed on 8th March 2020, but it is thought likely that infection began circulating
undetected prior to this, with genomic data indicating an introduction in mid-February and at least
eight introduced cases prior to the ban on international travel (Cowley et al., 2021). We therefore
initialise the model with eight infectious cases on 15th February 2020. The value of R0 was
optimised to minimise the absolute difference between modelled and reported cumulative deaths
on the date lockdown started (26th March). Following this optimisation of R0 , the value of ε ld was
similarly estimated by minimizing the difference between modelled deaths and data on the date
lockdown ended.

frequency to become the dominant virus variant (Saha et al., 2021). In March 2021, levels of maskwearing and compliance with household quarantine were low, and there was no lockdown in place.
As cases increased, a loose lockdown was introduced on 5th April, with stronger restrictions applied
on 14th April and maintained until end May, with some relaxing of restrictions over this period. We
modelled this with a lockdown from 5th April to 1st June, with a 9 day scale-up period, maximum
compliance of 80%, and the same rate of declining compliance as in 2020 (supplementary Fig.S1C).
We also assume that from 5th April to 1st June there is an increase in both mask-wearing (with
ε m = 0.5 and ρ m = 0.5 ) and household quarantine, with a scale-up period of 9 days to reach a
compliance of 30%. Given considerable uncertainty around the number of infectious and immune
individuals in the population, we calibrated the model under a range of initialisation scenarios in
terms of immunity levels (0%, 25% and 50%) and circulating cases on 1st March. We assumed that
reported daily new cases represented around 10% of true cases (supplementary Fig. S1C), and that
prevalent infectious individuals were about eight times incident daily cases given the infectious
period duration. Dividing by two, assuming that these individuals are on average halfway through
their infectious period, we get an effective number of 11,451 infectious individuals for initialization
and an equivalent number of incubating individuals, but we also considered numbers 50% higher
and lower than this. We took two approaches to optimisation of R0 , minimizing the difference: 1)
between modelled and reported cumulative deaths over the period from 1st March-5th April 2021,
and 2) in the timing of the peaks in reported cases and modelled symptomatic cases (with the
constraint that modelled cumulative deaths from 1st March until 20th May had to be at least as high
as reported deaths over the same period).

There is considerable uncertainty in the parameters governing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and health
impacts. We therefore undertook one-way sensitivity analyses across parameter value ranges for R0
, the duration of disease states and health outcome stages, the introduction date, the household
secondary attack rate, the ratios of asymptomatic to symptomatic transmission, and of pre- versus
symptomatic transmission identified as plausible from the literature (supplementary Table S4). The
impact of changes in each of these parameters on the main model outputs was assessed individually,
while keeping other parameter values fixed. We ran this analysis over scenarios of: 1) no
interventions; 2) lockdown as implemented; 3) lockdown plus household quarantining; and 4)
lockdown plus compulsory mask wearing (with ε m = 0.5 and ρ m = 0.5 ).

lockdown reduced between-household transmission ( ε ld ) by 97% for compliant individuals. The
match between modelled deaths and data during the early stages of the epidemic is illustrated in
supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Outputs from the calibrated model until the lockdown end indicate
that less than 10% of cases were recorded during this period (supplementary Fig. S1C). We further
explored how testing capacity might impact case detection within our interactive app, which
similarly indicated that the low, but increasing, testing capacity in Dhaka would fail to detect a high
proportion of cases given the high proportion of asymptomatic cases and distribution of tests to
individuals with other influenza-like illnesses.

Our estimates of R0 in 2021 varied based on the initialisation scenario, with values increasing with
lower initial circulating cases and higher levels of immunity in the population (supplementary Table
S5). The approach used to optimise R0 also impacted the estimates, with optimisation based on
matching to deaths in the early stages of the resurgence leading to lower values (range of 2.19-6.06)
compared to peak matching (range of 3.90-8.20). Our best guess initialisation scenario (11,451
initial infections and 25% prior immunity), led to an R0 estimate of 3.32 when matching to deaths
and 5.30 when matching to peak timing, and corresponding death detection estimates of 32-75%
(matching to deaths), or 8-22% (peak matching). The peak in symptomatic cases obtained by
matching to deaths was always slightly later than the peak in reported cases, though never by more
than four days. When calibrated to the trajectory of deaths, the model predicted that while NPIs
controlled the resurgence, another peak will occur in the coming months following their relaxation
(supplementary Fig. S2C). In contrast, calibration by matching peak timing leads to the prediction
that the resurgence sufficiently spread through the remaining susceptible population to prevent
further waves (supplementary Fig. S2D).

In the absence of interventions we predicted that COVID-19 patients would peak at 46,309 in late
May (Fig. 2A), greatly exceeding hospital bed capacity (estimated to be 10,947 in Dhaka District
(World Health Organisation (WHO), 2020b); supplementary Table S4). Under this scenario hospital
beds would have been unavailable for at least 55% of patient days (Fig. 3D) without accounting for
non-COVID-19 bed needs. Assuming unmitigated transmission, the epidemic would have likely led to
around 13.3 million cases (i.e. most of the Dhaka District population; supplementary Table S4) and
35,849 deaths (Figs. 3A, S2A & S3A). Although high relative to some of the mitigated scenarios,
these deaths represent 0.26% of the population, and would be expected to lead to a loss of <1% of
total working days (Fig. 3C).

We forecast that the lockdown as implemented in Bangladesh would delay the epidemic
(Figs 2A and S2A), with minor impacts on deaths and hospitalised cases (Fig. 3), while increasing
working days lost to 9.6%. Extensions were predicted to delay and widen the peak (Figs 2A and S2A,
extensions shown for up to three months, as further extensions had little impact on the epidemic
peak or total outcomes). Even with lockdown extensions, hospitalisations were still expected to
outstrip capacity (Fig.2A), with only modest reductions in deaths (Fig.3). Working days lost were
predicted to increase by 2.5-3.5% with each extra month of lockdown (Fig.3C).

We found that introducing household quarantining following lockdown led to the epidemic
peak being later, lower and wider than with lockdown alone (Figs 2A and S2A). Hospital capacity
was still exceeded, with deaths and hospitalisations reduced to levels similar to those achieved by a
three-month extension to lockdown. The additional working days lost by introducing and
maintaining household quarantines throughout 2020 were fewer than those lost by a one-month
lockdown extension (Fig. 3C).

The impact of introducing compulsory mask-wearing following lockdown varied based on
the effectiveness of the masks used (Figs 2B and 3). When ε m = 0.2 , i.e. low filtration efficiency,
only relatively small reductions to the epidemic peak were predicted, with the decline increasing
with mask effectiveness in terms of PPE (indicated by increasing ρ m ; Figs 2B and S2B). Masks with

high filtration efficiency ( ε m = 0.8 ), or medium filtration efficiency combined with high PPE

Combining mask-wearing with household quarantine led to greater predicted reductions in
the epidemic peak and in both deaths and hospitalisations than either intervention alone (Figs 2C
and 3A-B). Percentages of working days lost increase as mask quality decreases, ranging from 8.811.2%. A combined strategy of masks and quarantine following lockdown was strategized for
implementation in Dhaka District. In the end, mask provision was not directly funded despite
recommendations, but mask-wearing was promoted; by late 2020 mask use had largely declined to
normal levels. The data-based estimates of cumulative deaths in Dhaka District take a path similar to
those modelled by combining quarantining with either masks of high filtration effectiveness (
ε m = 0.8 ) and low to medium PPE abilities ( ρ m of 0 or 0.5), or with masks of medium filtration

439

Total costs of the scenarios explored ranged from $20.2.0-111.4 million (Fig. 4A). Despite requiring
no direct intervention costs, the baseline scenario is among the most expensive due to the
healthcare costs incurred by hospitalisations. Lockdown as implemented was predicted to be similar
in cost to the baseline (unmitigated transmission) with modest declines for lockdown extensions.
Incorporating household quarantine led to costs similar to extending lockdown for 2-3 months.
Combining lockdown with low effectiveness masks led to the highest costs due to the expense of
mask distribution, offset by only small reductions in healthcare costs. Masks of high effectiveness,
however, led to substantial cost reductions, which generally increased when masks and household
quarantine were modelled together.

440
441
442
443

Since most scenarios had a lower total cost than the baseline, the cost per death averted is
negative except in some of the lower effectiveness mask scenarios (Fig. 4B). Extended lockdowns,
and lockdowns combined with household quarantine and/or high effectiveness masks all provide
similar savings per death averted in the $1,500-$2,700 range.

451

The %ROI was generally positive, again with some exceptions where low effectiveness masks
were used (Fig. 4C). By far the highest %ROIs were given by extending lockdown by 2-3 months.
This is because, despite relatively small reductions in hospitalisations (Fig. 3B), the only costs to
lockdown extension are in advertising, and these costs are small relative to those of providing masks
to every household or maintaining CST (Table 1). Lockdown plus quarantining gave a %ROI of 127%.
The %ROI of all scenarios involving masks increased with the effectiveness of the masks in blocking
transmission. Interventions involving high effectiveness masks all had a higher %ROI than the
lockdown plus quarantine scenario.

decline in response to moving their start dates further before the end of lockdown. This difference
occurs because the combined early start date of the two interventions pushes the epidemic peak
later (into 2021) than when considering either individually. Continuing interventions and calculating
outcomes over both 2020 and 2021, removes this apparent improvement in outcomes with start
dates prior to lockdown’s end (supplementary Fig. S5A-D). As the start date of quarantining and
mask-wearing is delayed beyond the lockdown end date, their health benefits decline, with all
outcomes approaching those of the lockdown-only scenario. Similar consequences to delaying
intervention start dates result from lengthening the scale-up period (Fig. 5E-H).

We modelled interventions for controlling COVID-19 transmission in Dhaka District, Bangladesh,
comparing them based on their ability to prevent both deaths and overwhelming of the health
system, as well as on their societal and health provider costs. We found that under expected
compliance, lockdowns alone, regardless of duration, were both costly and unable to keep cases
below hospital capacity, while preventing only a small proportion of deaths, confirming that they are
not an appropriate long-term measure in this context (Amewu et al., 2020; Andam et al., 2020;
Rahman et al., 2020). Additional quarantining of households with symptomatic individuals similarly
was not predicted to prevent hospitalisations exceeding capacity. Modelling compulsory maskwearing after the lockdown produced outcomes that varied widely depending on the effectiveness
of masks in blocking transmission. Low-quality masks had limited impacts and were not costeffective, whereas high-quality masks substantially reduced deaths, protected the healthcare system
and were cost-effective. Combining mask-wearing and household quarantine led to further
reductions in deaths and excess hospitalisations, and was cost effective when masks were of high
quality. Simulations also suggest that early introductions of post-lockdown measures would have
had negligible additional impact over the full course of the epidemic (though they may improve
outcomes in the short-term), but gaps between lockdown ending and post-lockdown interventions
(or long periods of scale-up) quickly dilute their impacts.

507
508

The inability of symptomatic household quarantining alone to prevent hospitalisations
exceeding capacity is unsurprising. Even in HICs with greater healthcare capacity, lower R0

estimates, and a lower proportion of asymptomatic transmission, other modelling studies have
suggested that symptoms-based household quarantine would still overwhelm health systems (Aleta
et al., 2020; Ferguson et al., 2020). Additional tracing and quarantine of non-household contacts of
symptomatic individuals can improve the effectiveness of quarantine measures (Aleta et al., 2020).
However capacity for extensive contact tracing is likely to be limited in high-density resourceconstrained settings like Dhaka. The finding that combining symptomatic household quarantining
with mask mandates (using mid- to high-quality masks) leads to effective control was crucial at the
time, since both these NPIs were considered feasible. Given that household quarantining is
triggered by a symptomatic case, and we estimate that most cases in Bangladesh are asymptomatic,
a large proportion of infectious households are still likely missed by this measure, which will also
have only limited impact on pre-symptomatic transmission. Since masks reduce transmission for all
infections, irrespective of symptoms, masks work synergistically with household quarantine. While
we consider scenarios where masks block only 20% of transmission, we note that this is a worst case
scenario; experimental work suggests that our mid- to high-quality mask scenarios (blocking 50-80%
of transmission) are more likely (Aydin et al., 2020; Davies et al., 2013). Observational (Hong et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020) and other modelling (Stutt et al., 2020) studies provide further evidence
for the effectiveness of masks in blocking transmission.

In reality, achieving the modelled effectiveness of household quarantining and maskwearing depends on high compliance (we assumed 80% compliance in the main results presented
here). A survey in Israel suggested that quarantining compliance is likely to be highly dependent on
compensation for loss of work (Bodas and Peleg, 2020). However, such compensation may be
unachievable in many LMICs. Reducing insecurity experienced by households under quarantine in
other ways, for example by food provisioning and healthcare access, may help mitigate income loss

and boost compliance amongst poorer households. In Bangladesh, CSTs are already playing this role
in supporting quarantining households, and in LMICs more broadly, community health workers are
likely to prove invaluable in using the trust they have established to encourage compliance with NPIs
(Ballard et al., 2020).

Most of the NPIs we explored were very cost-effective, with savings per death averted and a
positive %ROI as a consequence of the high contribution of healthcare to overall costs. Note that
these returns occur despite the relatively young population in Bangladesh, which leads to a low
proportion of hospitalized cases (0.022). Furthermore, the societal costs (in terms of working days
lost) of the post-lockdown NPIs considered were small when compared with the initial lockdown
costs and potential extensions. These findings are in line with other work showing that the costs of
unmitigated transmission exceed those of implementing NPIs (Thunström et al., 2020; Torres-Rueda
et al., 2020). The costs we explore here are based on crude assumptions for mask purchase and
costs of training and rollout of CSTs in Dhaka where there is already a large community health
workforce that can be mobilized. However, we do not include food packages or additional support
for vulnerable communities that may increase NPI effectiveness but also costs.

Throughout the development of our model and interactive app, we incorporated
suggestions from policymakers on questions that most urgently needed answers, and on NPIs under
consideration and thought feasible to implement. This co-development allowed the investigation of
scenarios appropriate to the local context that addressed pressing policy concerns (McBryde et al.,
2020). The app, which allows a user-friendly exploration and visualisation of how scenarios impact
health outcomes and costs, proved to be an effective tool to support discussions with policymakers,
as the timing and combination of interventions, along with uncertainties in parameters, including
compliance, could be explored on the fly. This proved to be crucial in understanding the economic
and health trade-offs involved, as well as helping to demystify the model itself and the ensuing
epidemic.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, to ensure our model could run sufficiently
quickly within the interactive app, stochasticity and individual variation in transmission was not
incorporated. We expect only a minimal impact of these simplifications on disease trajectories and
key results due to the large population size considered and rapid epidemic growth observed.
However, they do limit the usefulness of the model for exploring elimination scenarios, since
stochasticity and superspreading, inherent to SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Adam et al., 2020), become
more influential under low levels of infection (Vespignani et al., 2020). Imported infections, which
may similarly become important near elimination, were also not considered. Age-structured models
have previously been proposed for studying COVID-19 (Davies et al., 2020b; Ferguson et al., 2020;
Keeling et al., 2020). We did not include age-structured transmission, which though not entirely
realistic, may be reasonable given the high degree of intergenerational mixing in Bangladesh
(United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2019a) and some other LMICs (Hodgins
and Saad, 2020). We also do not consider exacerbated mortality when hospital capacity is exceeded,
potentially underestimating mortality under some scenarios. Parameters used for case fatality, and
proportions of symptomatic and hospitalised infections, were based on age-dependent estimates
from HICs (Davies et al., 2020b, 2020a) and the age-distribution in Dhaka District. However, these
HIC-derived parameters may be less accurate when applied in this setting, as the incidence among
age classes of underlying conditions that increase COVID-19 risk likely differs in LMICs (Clark et al.,

2020). We also note that our estimates of working days lost make the assumption that employed
people cannot switch to working from home, possibly leading to overestimation.

577
578

More generally there remains considerable uncertainty around many of the model
parameters. Our sensitivity analyses indicated that R0 was, predictably, very influential in

579
580
581

determining health outcomes, but is sensitive to the introduction date and number of imported
cases which are uncertain. In addition, prior to the lockdown in 2020, only 5 deaths due to COVID19 had been recorded in Bangladesh, and given the inherent stochasticity in these events, tuning R0

582
583
584

to data in this time window is unlikely to be very accurate. Finally, prior to the 2020 lockdown, some
control measures, such as cancellations of large gatherings, had already been taken(Anwar et al.,
2020), potentially lowering our R0 estimate. Our estimates of R0 in 2021 similarly assumed no

585
586

interventions in the run-up to the 5 April lockdown, but low levels of mask-wearing and quarantine
may have led to underestimation. The 2020 R0 estimate for Dhaka lies within the 90% confidence

587
588
589

interval estimated from a meta-analysis of pre-March 2020 estimates (Davies et al., 2020b). Many of
our 2021 estimates exceed this confidence interval, but none are in excess of the confidence interval
reported by Sanche et al. (2020). A possibly higher R0 value for 2021 is also not unexpected, given

590
591

the dominant variant at the time (B.1.351) was known to be more transmissible than variants
prevalent in 2020. The effect of lockdown on between-household transmission rates was, like R0 ,

592
593
594
595
596
597

tuned to reported death data, and proved to be higher than was anticipated in this high density
population; reducing transmission by 97%, suggesting that lockdown was very effective as a shortterm control measure. This high impact on compliant individuals might have been compensating for
our conservative assumption of no reduction in transmission from essential workers under lockdown
(unless off sick with symptomatic COVID-19), or underestimated lockdown compliance. An
overestimated R0 (or indeed inaccuracies in other parameters) could also lead to overestimated

598

impacts of lockdown.

Our initial model assumed that recovered individuals remain immune through 2020.
Although immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is not permanent (Iwasaki, 2021), this assumption appeared
reasonable given effects of immunity loss were likely limited over this period. However, with
resurging cases in 2021 concomitant with relaxed NPIs and the emergence of the more transmissible
B.1.351 variant, the question of immunity became paramount (Saha et al., 2021). The level of
immunity in the population at the time of the resurgence was very uncertain, given only limited data
from which to infer case detection and laboratory evidence that prior COVID-19 infections elicit less
protection to the B1.351 variant (Planas et al., 2021). These uncertainties translated into our
estimates of R0 in 2021, which varied widely (2.19-8.2) under different assumptions, but with a best

608

guess of 3.32-5.30. The uncertainty in R0 in turn leads to uncertainty in predictions, with some

609

suggesting a possible further wave later in 2021, while others preclude this.

We demonstrated the sensitivity of outcomes to the timing and scale-up of interventions,
but human behavioural responses most dramatically impact outcomes. For these reasons, our model
was primarily developed as a means to understand the potentially synergistic impact of
interventions, rather than to accurately forecast dynamics subject to unpredictable changing human
behaviours. We therefore considered compliance to interventions to be a crucial interactive element
of our app to build understanding and guidance on policy. Within the app, we also modelled the
degree to which the limited (but greatly increased) testing capacity would still under-detect

circulating cases, given some degree of cognitive dissonance and the considerable uncertainty in
pre- and asymptomatic transmission during the early months of the pandemic. Overall we found the
interactive app to be effective for communicating epidemiological modelling outcomes to
policymakers together with their caveats, and we recommend the use of such tools that can be
tailored to other settings and interventions.

In summary, we found that two NPIs combined, masks and symptoms-based household
quarantining, were capable of averting an anticipated public health crisis in Dhaka, while also being
good value for money. These measures were to a large extent rolled out in Bangladesh in 2020, and
appear to have contributed to limiting transmission, but the ensuing epidemic stretched the health
system. In practice, compliance with these interventions and fidelity of their implementation was
highly heterogeneous, with measures relaxing over the year as activity returned to levels
approaching normalcy. The surge in cases in 2021, apparently driven by the B.1.35 variant, has now
largely subsided. However, predictions about the risk of a further wave depend on, as yet,
unqualified assumptions and vaccination coverage remains low. NPIs therefore still have an
important role to play, particularly mask wearing, which is both very cost-effective and feasible, and
vaccine rollout needs to be pursued at pace.
