Highlights
•

Higher baseline HDL levels were associated with reduced odds of testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2.

•

BMI, Type II diabetes and hemoglobin A1C levels were associated with elevated odds of
testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but this effect was abrogated when controlling for
HDL.

•

Red wine intake was associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2,
although this effect may in part be moderated by HDL.

•

Baseline LDL and Triglyceride levels were not associated with increased odds of testing
positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract
Background
SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading coronavirus with a high incidence of severe upper
respiratory infection that first presented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Many factors have
been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much attention being paid to body mass
index (BMI). Little investigation has been done to investigate dysregulation of lipid profiles and
diabetes, which are often comorbid in high BMI patients.
Objective
This study seeks to describe the impact of BMI, HDL, LDL, ApoA, ApoB, triglycerides,
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetes, alcohol and red wine intake on the odds of testing positive
for SARS-CoV-2 in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants.
Methods
We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the odds of testing
positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March
16 through July 14, 2020. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed using
logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and ancestry.
Results
Higher BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 odds (p
< 0.05) while HDL and ApoA were associated with decreased odds (p < 0.001). Though the

effect of BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were eliminated when HDL was controlled, the
effect of HDL remained significant when BMI was controlled for. Additionally, red wine intake
was associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.05). LDL, ApoB
and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased odds.
Conclusion
Elevated HDL and ApoA levels and alcohol intake, specifically red wine intake, were associated
with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while higher BMI, type II diabetes and
HbA1c were associated with increased odds. The effects of alcohol, BMI, type II diabetes and
HbA1c levels were no longer significant after controlling for HDL, suggesting that these effects
may be mediated in part through regulation of HDL levels. In summary, our study corroborates
the emerging picture that high HDL levels may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Since early December 2019, when the first cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or Covid-19) were identified in Wuhan, China, nearly 13 million
individuals have tested positive for the virus (1). Researchers have rapidly attempted to define
the clinical characteristics associated with increased risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV2 to improve our understanding and clinical management of this pandemic. Early data from
across the globe have identified pre-existing cardiovascular disease and obesity as risk factors
associated with acquiring SARS-CoV-2 (2-8). Curiously, early data from China also found that
hypolipidemia and declining HDL at the time of acute COVID19 illness was associated with
disease severity (9, 10). There remains limited research on how an individual’s baseline
cardiometabolic profile, specifically lipid levels, affect one’s risk for contracting the virus. This
has received particular attention as the known viral entry mechanism for SARS-CoV-1, a closely
related virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, has been shown, in preliminary
in-vitro studies, to be cholesterol-dependent (11). In this paper we analyze the association of a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test with an individual’s lipid profile in the UK Biobank resource.

Methods
The UK Biobank resource began releasing SARS-CoV-2 test results in April 2020 to
approved researchers. Full details on these test results are available online (12). Using test results
released on July 14, 2020, we classified subjects testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 as cases. If
multiple tests were performed, we classified a subject as a case if any test gave a positive result,
based on the rationale that false positives are less likely than false negatives. Those with only

negative test results were classified as controls. Tests were initially conducted in hospital settings
in individuals who presented with respiratory symptoms. From April 27th onward, testing was
expanded to include community clinics and all non-elective patients admitted overnight,
including those who were asymptomatic. 70.1% of the 9,005 subjects (cases and controls) were
inpatient when the sample was taken, 74.1% of 7,497 controls were inpatient when the sample
was taken and 50.3% of 1,508 cases were inpatient when the sample was taken. The vast
majority of samples for testing were obtained by nose/throat swabs and samples were analyzed
for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via PCR.
The association analysis was performed with Plink2 (13) using logistic regression. The
binary outcome variable of “SARS-CoV-2 test status” (cases tested positive, controls tested
negative) was run against a series of independent variables which included continuous,
categorical, and binary ICD10 data supplied by the UK Biobank. The data for continuous and
categorical traits were collected when subjects were enrolled into the UK Biobank (2006-2010).
Serum was collected for analysis of LDL, HDL, ApoA, ApoB and triglycerides. LDL was
analyzed by enzymatic selective protection, HDL was analyzed by enzyme immunoinhibition,
ApoA and ApoB were analyzed by immunoturbidimetric analysis and triglycerides were
measured by GPO-POD. All analyses were completed using the AU5800 by Beckman Coulter.
Height and weight were measured, and BMI was computed from these values. Impedance BMI
was measured by bioelectrical impedance using the Tanita BC418MA body composition
analyzer. Additional details on collection and analysis of biomarkers (e.g. LDL, HDL, ApoA) are
available from the UK Biobank website (14). ICD10 diagnostic codes are current for all
subjects through October 2019. We also grouped the ICD10 code data into Phecodes in order to
increase statistical power (15). The analysis included covariates of sex, age, and principal

components (PCs) 1 through 4 to adjust for ancestry. Principal component analysis, a standard
technique used in statistical genetics, generates a dataset of PCs (typically 10) that can be used as
covariates to correct for population stratification (i.e. differences in ancestry) (16). PCs provided
by the UK Biobank, which were computed from the cohort’s genotypes, were used. Our
preliminary analysis showed that only the first 4 PCs were significant at p < 0.05 and thus we
included only PC1-4 as covariates.
Our analysis yielded odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each trait
tested against the “SARS-CoV-2 test status”. An OR greater than 1.0 indicates increased odds of
a SARS-CoV-2 positive test compared to the controls. An OR less than 1.0 indicates decreased
odds. For continuous phenotypes, the OR indicates the increased odds (for OR > 1.0) or
decreased odds (for OR < 1.0) per standard deviation increase in the continuous phenotype.

This dataset includes 1,508 cases and 7,497 controls for a total of 9,005 subjects. Prior to
the association analysis we compared the cases and controls for differences in sex, ancestry and
age. Significant differences were found between the sex (p-value = 1.3x10-3; Table 1), ancestry
(p-value = 1.1x10-15; Table 1) and age (p-value = 3.4x10-8; Table 1) of cases and controls.

BMI
Body mass index (BMI) has been shown to increase SARS-CoV-2 risk across many
populations (3). Interestingly, we found that BMI was associated with an increased odds of
SARS-CoV-2 positive testing (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.06 – 1.18, p-value = 6.14x10-5; Table 2)
but when HDL was controlled for this effect was no longer significant (OR = 1.06, 95% CI =
0.995 – 1.13, p-value = 0.071; Table 2). These findings were consistent when BMI was measured
by electrical impedance (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.06 – 1.18, p-value = 8.54x10-5; Table 2) and the
significance was also lost when HDL was controlled for (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.994 – 1.13, pvalue = 0.077; Table 2).

After controlling for age, sex and 4pc, we found that plasma HDL levels were associated
with a reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.845, 95% CI = 0.788 – 0.907,
p-value = 2.45x10-6; Table 3), this effect was maintained even when controlling for BMI (OR =
0.863, 95% CI = 0.801 – 0.93, p-value = 1.17x10-4; Table 3). Moreover, we found that plasma
levels of Apolipoprotein A (ApoA), the major protein component of HDL particles in plasma,
were also associated with a reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.849, 95%
CI = 0.793 – 0.910, p-value = 2.90x10-6; Table 3). The effect of ApoA also remained significant
when controlling for BMI (OR = 0.865, 95% CI = 0.806 – 0.929, p-value = 6.97x10-5; Table 3).
Consistent with high collinearity between HDL and ApoA, the effect of either is negligible when
the opposite is controlled for suggesting that both describe the same effect (Table 3).

Hyperlipidemia/LDL/ApoB/Triglycerides
The diagnosis of hyperlipidemia (ICD10 codes E78.4 and E78.5) was modestly
associated with an elevated odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR=1.362, 95% CI=1.021
- 1.817, p-value 0.036; Table 4). However, when ApoA, HDL or BMI were controlled for, this

effect was no longer significant (Table 4). In contrast to prior studies, we did not find any
association between LDL levels and odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.995, 95%
CI = 0.939 – 1.055, p-value = 0.872; Table 4) (9). Consistent with this, apolipoprotein B, the
primary lipoprotein associated with plasma LDL, was not associated with any significant effect
on odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.003, 95% CI = 0.947 – 1.063, p-value =
0.910; Table 4). Additionally, no significant effect of triglyceride levels on odds of testing
positive for SARS-CoV-2 were found (OR = 1.026, 95% CI = 0.969 – 1.087, p-value = 0.375;

Alcohol/Red Wine Intake
Frequency of alcohol intake was associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARSCoV-2 (Figure 1). There appears to be a “dosage dependent effect” as the significant OR
reduction is found only above 3-4 alcohol drink consumption per week (OR = 0.716, 95% CI =
0.578 - 0.997), p-value = 2.28x10-3, Table 5), with maximal impact seen with daily alcohol
consumption (OR = 0.660, 95% CI = 0.530 – 0.821, p-value = 1.98 x 10-4; Table 5).

Interestingly, this effect is diminished slightly after controlling for HDL (3-4x/week: OR =
0.752, 95% CI = 0.593 – 0.953, p = 0.0183; daily: OR = 0.733, 95% CI = 0.574 - 0.936, p-value
= 0.0129; Table 5). Of the types of alcohol beverages recorded (Spirits, Fortified Wine, Red
Wine, White Wine and Beer), only increased red wine intake was associated with reduced odds
of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.883, 95% CI = 0.811 – 0.960, p-value = 3.75x10-3;
Table 6). Again, this effect is diminished slightly after controlling for HDL (OR = 0.904, 95% CI
= 0.825 – 0.991, p-value = 0.0314; Table 6), suggesting that HDL, at least in part, mediates the
effect of alcohol intake on the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Diabetes/HbA1c
The diagnosis of Type II diabetes (Phecode phe250.2) was associated with an elevated
odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR =1.213, 95% CI =1.028 - 1.432, p-value = 0.0225;
Table 7). Consistent with this, we found that HbA1c level was associated with a significant
increase in odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.061, 95% CI = 1.005 – 1.121, pvalue = 0.0332; Table 7). However, when ApoA, HDL or BMI were controlled for, the effects
of both the type II diabetes diagnosis and HgA1c level were no longer significant (Table 7).
Curiously, Type I diabetes (Phecode phe250.1) was not associated with an elevated odds of
testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 7).

Discussion
Early studies of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic identified pre-existing cardiovascular disease
and obesity as risk factors associated with acquiring SARS-CoV-2 (2-8). In addition prior studies
found that hypolipidemia and declining HDL in the setting of acute Covid-19 illness was
associated with disease severity (9, 10). Moreover, obesity was associated with higher

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 disease severity (3, 7, 8). Here, we sought
to validate these findings by examining the potential effects of baseline BMI, lipoproteins, their
respective apolipoproteins and diabetes on the odds of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort from
the UK Biobank dataset. We confirmed that baseline hyperlipidemia was associated with the
odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, but this association was driven primarily by
association of baseline lower HDL and ApoA levels with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, suggesting
specifically that HDL may play a role in predisposing patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Moreover, consistent with an earlier study (7), we confirmed the association of high BMI with
the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, this effect was no longer significant
when baseline HDL and ApoA levels were controlled for. We also found association of Type II
(but not Type I) Diabetes and HbA1c levels with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Again, when baseline
ApoA or HDL levels were controlled for, the effects of both the Type II diabetes diagnosis and
HbA1c level were no longer significant. Given that Type II diabetes is associated with reduced
HDL levels, we hypothesize that the elevated odds associated with Type II diabetes is mediated
in part through its effect on HDL levels. Taken together, our results suggest that HDL may be
mediating part of the well known effect of BMI on SARS-CoV-2 /Covid-19 risk and plays a
greater role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis than previously appreciated.
Interestingly, we found that intake of red wine, but not other alcoholic beverages, was
associated with reduced odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a “dose-dependent” manner
(at least 3 glasses per week). This is counterintuitive, given that prior research suggests there is a
dose dependent relationship between alcohol intake and viral infections (17). Nevertheless, red
wine, in particular, has been shown to have positive effects on endothelial function, glucose
metabolism and HDL upregulation when consumed in moderate quantities (18). We speculate

whether red wine intake and HDL may modulate inflammatory, endothelial and lipid
characteristics in such a way to confer some degree of protection to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Although the findings of this study persist when appropriate controls are applied, we
acknowledge the inherent limitations of this association study, which is subject to sampling bias.
Importantly, we do not know the context in which the SARS-CoV-2 testing was carried out, the
HDL status at the time of testing, and the disease severity of each case. Participants tested in this
study were primarily those who presented to a clinical care site with symptoms suggestive of
SARS-CoV-2. Although this has the potential to marginally increase SARS-CoV-2 positive
testing rate, it is unlikely to influence the association of HDL, BMI and alcohol consumption
with SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate. Additionally, while majority of those tested were inpatient at
the time of sampling, we acknowledge the potential confounding effects of subsequent expansion
of testing into the community and to asymptomatic patients; however, we believe that such
effects would tend to diminish any association with SARS-CoV-2 test positive rates.
Another limitation of an association study based on UK Biobank is that the baseline
cardiometabolic data was collected several years prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However,
we do not believe that this did not have a substantial impact on our findings. While mean BMI
has been reported to have increased around the world from 1976 to 2016, this increase has
plateaued in recent years in high-income English-speaking countries, including the UK (22).
Additionally, mean triglyceride, HDL and LDL levels tend to change only modestly or remain
relatively stable in the population over time (23, 24). We believe that these modest changes over
time would tend to diminish their associations with SARS-CoV-2 test positive rates, particularly
if abnormal baseline levels were treated in the interim with medications. With regard to alcohol

intake, the Institute of Alochol Studies based in the UK, reports that levels of drinking among
adults in 2018 was comparable to drinking in 2010 (25).
Despite these limitations, we believe that our exploration of SARS-CoV-2 corroborates
some of the earlier studies and provides valuable insight and guidance for future studies. One of
the most compelling finding of this study is the association of lower baseline HDL levels with
SARS-CoV-2 positivity, which corroborates an earlier study, which found association of
declining HDL levels with Covid-19 disease severity (10). While causal inferences are beyond
the scope of this study, given HDL’s established antioxidant, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory characteristics, it seems plausible that HDL may play a protective role in
preventing the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 infection (19). Alternatively, HDL is now known
to transport a wide range of cargo other than cholesterol, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) (20).
These non-canonical roles of HDL are consistent with the direct, nonselective antiviral effects of
HDL (21). Our analysis opens up several avenues for further study, for example, to determine
whether baseline HDL levels can identify high risk patients, to explore whether pharmacological
modulation of HDL levels may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, or even to
examine whether HDL particle confers direct protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
