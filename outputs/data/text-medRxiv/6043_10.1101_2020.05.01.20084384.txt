Abstract
Background:

In

this

work,

we

presented

a

Susceptible-Infected-Removed

(SIR)

epidemiological model of COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia post- and pre-Movement Control
Order (MCO). The proposed SIR model was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the
official press statements to closely reflect the observed epidemic trend in Malaysia. The
proposed model is aimed to provide an accurate predictive information for decision makers
in assessing the public health and social measures related to COVID-19 epidemic. Methods:
The SIR model was fitted to the data by minimizing a weighted loss function; the sum of the
residual sum of squares (RSS) of infected, removed and total cases. Optimized beta (β),),
gamma (γ) parameter values) parameter values and the starting value of susceptible individuals (N) were
obtained. Results: The SIR model post-MCO indicates the peak of infection on 10 April 2020,
less than 100 active cases by 8 July 2020, less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, and
close to zero daily new case by 22 July 2020, with a total of 6562 infected cases. In the
absence of MCO, the model predicts the peak of infection on 1 May 2020, less than 100 active
cases by 14 February 2021, less than 10 active cases by 26 April 2021 and close to zero daily
new case by 6 October 2020, with a total of 1.6 million infected cases. Conclusion: The
results suggest that the present MCO has significantly reduced the number of susceptible
population and the total number of infected cases. The method to fit the SIR model used in
this study was found to be accurate in reflecting the observed data. The method can be used
to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in other countries.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 was announced as a
pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, less than 3 months since the
epidemic started in Wuhan, China. As of 29 April 2020, the number of cases climbed above 3
million with a death toll of over 200,000 worldwide [1, 2]. In response to COVID-19, many
countries implemented a large scale public health and social measures (PHSM), including
movement restrictions, closure of schools and businesses, geographical area quarantine, and
international travel restrictions. These measures are sometimes referred to as “lockdown” or
“cordon sanitaire”.
Similarly, in Malaysia a large scale PHSM called Movement Control Order (MCO)
was announced to the whole country under the Prevention and Control of Infectious
Diseases Act 1988 (Act 342) on 16 Mac 2020. Following the MCO, all gatherings, whether for
religious, sports, recreational, social or cultural purposes are banned. All universities,
schools and non-essential sectors are closed. Journeys from one place to another within any
infected local area are not allowed except for the following purposes: to perform any official
duty; to make a journey to and from any premises providing essential services, non-essential
services or food supply; to purchase, supply or deliver food or daily necessities; to seek
healthcare or medical services; or any other special purposes as may be permitted by the
Director General of Health. Inter-state journeys from one infected local area to another
infected local area are not allowed unless prior written permission of a police officer in
charge of a police station is obtained [3].

The first MCO (MCO1) started on 18 March until 31 March 2020, for a duration of
two weeks. It was then continued every 2 weeks, second MCO (MCO2) till 14 April 2020,
third MCO (MCO3) till 28 April 2020 and fourth MCO (MCO4) till 12 May 2020. Malaysia is
still under MCO until the day of writing [2].
PHSM involving the whole country continuously for almost 8 weeks is not without a
burden. It has a major social consequences and economic costs. At the moment, the decision
to implement MCO was acceptable to many in view of disease casualties, but the question is
how long should the MCO be in place? There is a need for Malaysian authority to assess and
balance the benefits and potential harms of adjusting these MCO duration, so as not to
trigger a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and jeopardize the health of the population.
In this study, we presented a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological
model of the COVID-19 epidemic in Malaysia following the MCO and prior to the MCO. To
make sure the model closely reflects the observed epidemic trend, the proposed SIR model
was fitted to confirmed COVID-19 cases from the official press statements by the Director
General of Health, Malaysia by optimizing a chosen loss function. The proposed model is
aimed to provide an accurate predictive information in assessing the public health and social
measures for COVID-19 epidemic and in due course make timely future plans.

SIR Model
One of the mathematical models that describe the population level dynamics of infectious
diseases is the classical SIR compartmental disease model, which is based on the work of
Kermack and Kendrick in 1930s [4]. Conceptually, the SIR model is presented schematically
as shown in Figure 1 below:

Assuming zero birth and death rate, this SIR model can be defined by a set of
ordinary differential equations as follows [4, 5]:

is the transmission rate (contact rate x probability of transmission given contact).
The basic reproductive number, R0 is defined as the “average number of secondary
cases arising from a typical primary case in an entirely susceptible population” [4]. The R0 is
given as:

β
R0 = γ [4]

Finding Optimal Model Parameters
To fit the model to the data, the following weighted loss function was defined, taking the
sum of the residual sum of squares (RSS) for Y = I, R and total cases (I + R):

^ 2 +w 3 ∑ ((I +R) −( I^ + R))
^ 2 [5]
L (Y , Y^ )=w 1 ∑ (I − I^ )2+w 2 ∑ (R − R)

The model was fitted to the data using the methods described in [6, 7] in R software
environment [8], utilizing deSolve R package [9]. For optimization procedure, the

parameters value were set within clinically reasonable start, upper and lower limits: β), = {1/2,
1/100, 1} and γ) parameter values = {1/14, 1/42 (6 weeks [10]), 1/11 (2 weeks [10], minus 3 days to allow
parameter exploration)}.
Apart from finding the β), and γ) parameter values parameter values, in Malaysian context, experts were
divided about the initial number of susceptible individuals, S, which is N. Thus, we also
estimated the N of the model by iterating over a decreasing number of N, starting from N =
32.68 million of Malaysian population in 4 th quarter of 2019 [11]. The optimal N was the
number that fitted within the SIR model with the smallest value of the loss function. The
pseudo-code for the iteration procedure is given in Algorithm 1 below. In our experiment,
Step = MaxStep = 7 was found to be sufficient.

Once the optimal β),, γ) parameter values and N values that minimized the loss function were found,
projected data were obtained from the SIR model using the optimized parameters. Using the
data, the SIR model was plotted using ggplot2 R package [12]. The goodness of fit and error
rate measures of the fitted model were given in form of R 2 and mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE).

Results
For the analysis, we divided the analysis into two distinct periods: post-MCO (25 March
2020 until 29 April 2020) and pre-MCO (1 March 2020 to 24 March 2020). The post-MCO
period starts one-week following the MCO initiation (18 March 2020) to allow a one-week
grace period for the population to reach an optimal compliance of the MCO. We excluded
imported cases from the data points by 24 April 2020 onwards as the daily new cases
included a notable number of imported cases, which violated our assumption for the SIR
model of no addition to the starting population. The pre-MCO period includes the first week
of MCO1 as we assumed that the epidemiological pattern prior to MCO implementation is
similar to the first week of MCO1. The post-MCO period analysis reflects the SIR modeling
of COVID-19 epidemic trend in the presence of MCO, while the pre-MCO analysis reflects
the SIR modeling of the epidemic trend in the absence of MCO.
Figures 1 and 2 show the plots of the SIR model for the post-MCO period. Figure 2
includes additional curves, assuming 5% (Beijing) and 50% (Iceland) asymptomatic cases
[13].

includes additional curves, assuming 5% (Beijing) and 50% (Iceland) asymptomatic cases

Here, we limited the algorithm to search for the optimal parameters between 5% to 100% of
the initial susceptible population so as to reflect the absence of MCO. In addition, this was
also because whenever the data do not contain the peak of active cases, the algorithm is
unable to find the optimal N .

Discussion
The SIR model following the MCO indicates that the infection already peaked on 10 April
2020, after which the number of active cases started to decline. There will be less than 100
active cases by 8 July 2020 and less than 10 active cases by 29 August 2020, close to zero
daily new case (when the predicted new case < 0.5) by 22 July 2020. The total number of
infected cases was predicted to be between 6560 to 13895 cases. In contrast, if the MCO was
not implemented, the infection will peak on 1 May 2020, and there will be less than 100
active cases by 14 February 2021, less than 10 active cases by 26 April 2021 and close to zero

daily new case by 6 October 2020, with a larger number of total infected cases between 1.6
million to 3.3 million cases.
The fitted models for both periods maintained high goodness of fit, indicated by R 2
values of 85.2% to 98.7% for I and R respectively. The error rates by MAPE were low for
post-MCO period with MAPE (I) and MAPE (R) of 4.4% and 13.4% respectively. The error
rates were slightly higher for pre-MCO period, with MAPE (I) and MAPE (R) of 33.2% and
15.4% respectively. This is because the data pattern during that period was relatively less
well explained by the SIR model especially for I, and the number of data points was smaller
as compared to post-MCO period (24 vs 36). This could also be due to these reasons: a) the
Ministry of Health increased the test capacity, b) delay in receiving the test results due to
overwhelmed laboratory capacity and c) the number of tests fluctuates on daily basis [14,
15]. However, this high error rate was balanced by high R 2 for both I and R (87.9% and 87.8%
respectively).
The R0 for all presented figures were relatively high as compared to other studies [16,
17, 18]. For post-MCO period, the R 0 is close to 3, which is against the common assumption
that the R0 should be low once health intervention measures kicks in. This is also the case
with the pre-MCO R0, which is more than 8. However, these R 0s for both periods were the
ones that best explained the observed data. We propose that this observation might suggest
the real infectiveness in the susceptible population, which is the fuel of the epidemic.
Although the infectiveness of COVID-19 remains high following the MCO, the size of
susceptible population reduced significantly as a result of MCO implementation. At the

same time, it was found that MCO significantly reduced transmission rate by 44.3%, from β),
= 0.273 to β), = 0.152.

Limitations
The model was unable to consider imported cases because the size of susceptible population
was assumed fixed at the start of each prediction period. Hence, another approach must be
considered whenever imported cases are present. The performance measures provided in
form of R2 and MAPE can be viewed as the goodness of fit and error measures for the
training set, which may not be generalizable to future observations and there could be an
issue with model overfitting [19]. However, given the limited number of available data
points, all available data points were used for the model optimization. Given the urgency of
the present situation, it is not reasonable to wait for more data points to be used as the test
set to estimate the test goodness of fit and error measures. In our opinion, cross-validation
method is also not reasonable in this situation given the small number of data points.
Finally, our model used the available incidence data instead of the data based on date of
onset [20]. Despite this limitation, we feel that our SIR model, to some extent, reflects the
true COVID-19 epidemic trend.

Conclusion
The results showed that the implementation of the MCO from 18 March 2020 until today has
significantly reduced the COVID-19 transmission in Malaysia. The MCO effectively
restricted the number of susceptible population, resulting in a smaller number of infected

cases. Based on the model, the flattened epidemic curve is expected to be in July this year.
The method used in this study to fit the SIR model was shown to be accurate in reflecting the
observed data. This method can be used to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in other
countries.
