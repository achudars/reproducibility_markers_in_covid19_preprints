Abstract
The outbreak of COVID 19 has been provoking several problems to the health
system around the world. One of the concerning is the crash of the health
system due to the increasing demand suddenly. To avoid it, knowing the total
number and daily new cases is crucial. In this study, we fitted curves growth
models using a Bayesian approach. We extracted information obtained from
some countries to build the prior distribution of the model. The total number
of cases of the COVID 19 in the state of Goias was analyzed. Results from
analysis indicated that the date of the outbreak peak is between 51 and 68 days
after the beginning. Moreover, the total number of cases is around 3180 cases.
The analysis did not take into consideration possibles changes in government
control measures. We hope this study can provide some valuable information
to public health management.

19 outbreak as pandemic on March 11, 2020 ([19]; [20]). Brazil confirmed the
first case of COVID 19 on 26, February 2020 [1].
Since then, the outbreak has gotten attention from researchers, media, authorities, and society in general ([14];[19]).
During an infectious disease outbreak, one of the concerning is the crash
of the health system due to the increasing demand suddenly. In this context,
knowing the total number and daily new cases is crucial.
In the literature, there are many statistical and mathematical methods to
solve this problem. Compartment models ([17]; [22]), partially observed Markov
process [9], temporal network analysis [13], growth curves ([16]; [24]; [25]) and
others.
In this study, we fitted curves growth models to the dataset. Predict the
values of a time series, assuming a Gompertz or logistic trend, is not a new idea
[23]. [2] fitted the Gompertz curve to predict the total number of cases of the
COVID 19 in Iran.
Here we used Bayesian inference. The main advantage of this approach is
to include other sources of the information besides the dataset itself. For this
particular case, we extracted information obtained from some countries to build
the prior distribution of the model. We analyzed the data from the state of
Goias, Brazil, as an example.

Material and Methods

The data of the countries analyzed in this study can be found at [26] and the
total number and daily new cases of the COVID 19 in the state of Goias are
available at [8].
The main objective of the study is to make predictions of the total number
of cases of COVID 19 in the state of Goias, Brazil. For this purpose, we fit a
Gompertz and Logistic’s non-linear regression [25] to the data using the Bayesian
inference approach [11]. However, we are at the beginning of the outbreak and
therefore have a few data available. To figure out this problem, we included
prior information from results obtained of the fitting frequentist non-linear to
data of other countries.
Initially, we fitted a Gompertz and Logistic non-linear regression model to
data of total number of cases of the COVID 19 for some countries, such as
China, Germany, Italy, Philippines, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States of America. We have chosen these countries because all
of them are in the advanced stage of the COVID 19 outbreak, and there is
significant variability among them.
The Gompertz non linear regression model can be expressed as
yt = A exp(− exp(−Kg(t − T0 )))

(1)

where yt is the total number of cases of COVID 19 observed at t − th time, A is
the upper asymptote that represents the total case at the end of the outbreak,

Kg is the growth-rate coefficient and T0 represent time at inflection, or the time
when will occur the maximum daily new cases.
The Logistic non linear regression model can be described mathematically
by
yt =

L
1 + exp{−k(t − t0 )}

(2)

where yt is the total cases of COVID 19 observed at t − th time, L is the upper
asymptote, k is the growth-rate coefficient and t0 represent time at inflection.
For the data set of these countries, we use the maximum likelihood estimator
because we have a quantity enough of data. Non-linear regression was fitted
using nlsLM function of R package minpack.lm [10] of R statistical software
[21]. Model selection between Gompertz and Logistic was done via Akaike
Information Criterion [3].
From the results of the non-linear models fitted by maximum likelihood, we
build the prior distribution of the parameters of the Bayesian non-linear models
used to estimate the total number of cases of Goias state.
For each country, we have a correspondent model and their maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of Gompertz’s model (A, Kg , T0 ), and of
the logistic model(L, k, t0 ), respectively.
The idea is to use each maximum likelihood estimate as a hypothesis and use
them as to the prior distribution. In this step, we are inferring the resemblance
between the Goias state curve and curve of other countries.
For parameters A and L, we have to take into considerations that each
country has a different population and different than the Goiás state. Hence,
we estimate the prevalence of the disease for an i-th country from expression
Ai divided by Ni , where Ni is the population of that country. After that, we
multiplied the prevalence by the population of Goiás state. This number is
equivalent to the total number of cases that would occur in Goiás, whether the
hypothesis is true.
For example, let’s suppose we have (Âi , K̂gi , T̂0i ) to be a Gompertz’s model
maximum likelihood estimates for i-th country.
In this case, the prior can be expressed as

Kg

Âi
N, σA )
Ni
∼ N (K̂gi , σKg )

(4)

T0

∼ N (T̂0i , σT0 )

(5)

A ∼ N(

(3)

where σA , σKg , σT0 are standard deviation of prior distribution. We used the
standard error of maximum likelihood estimates as standard deviation of prior
distribution.
Parameters inference was done via Gibbs Sampling algorithm [11] We used
burn in equal to 5000 and number of iterations equal to 10000.

We did the sensibility analysis of prior distribution and comparison between
models the using Watanabe – Akaike information criterion (WAIC) [4]. All
Bayesian computations were done using the bmrs R package ([5]; [6]).
After sensibility analysis, we set an additional model building a prior distribution based on subjective evaluation of values of all maximum likelihood
estimates obtained for each country.
For the variable total number of cases of COVID 19, we chose the model
with the smallest WAIC, and then, we replaced the standard deviation of upper
asymptote and time inflection by a value much higher with the objective to give
freedom to parameters learn with data. We proceed that way because there is
much uncertainty about the total number of cases of COVID 19. In this stage of
the outbreak, we do not have any specific value of reference for upper asymptote
and time inflection.

Results

Figure 1 shows bar plots for the daily number of new cases and scatter plots for
the total number of cases of COVID 19 for some countries around the world.
Except for the United States of America, all countries analyzed possibly have
already crossed the inflection point of the curve. China is the most advanced
country in the pandemic. South Korea’s curve is singular. After the curve has
been reaching out of the plateau, the total number of cases of COVID 19 still
grows, indicating a possible ”second wave” of the pandemic.
Table 1 and 2 shows the maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters
of Gompertz and logistic model, respectively.
Gompertz’s model provided higher values of upper asymptote and their respective standard errors than the logistic model. On the other hand, the estimates of the time inflection are pretty much the same for both models.
We can explain the difference between estimates of the upper asymptote,
analyzing the shape of each curve and the dataset. Firstly, the abscissa of the
point of the inflection of the logistic model corresponds to the half between
two asymptotes, i. e. f (t0 ) = L2 . On the other hand, the abscissa of the
point of the inflection of the Gompertz’s model is slightly smaller, f (T0 ) = Ae
(references). Now, let’s suppose we have the same point of inflection for both
curve, i.e, f (t0 ) = f (T0 ) = f . Thus, we have A = ef and L = 2f , which implies
A > L. Furthermore, the COVID19 outbreaks is not in the plateau for most of
the countries. Therefore, there is much uncertainty about the upper asymptotes
of the curve, which explains the high values of standard errors.
China and South Korea reached out to the plateau faster than remainings
countries. Taiwan has the least total number of cases followed by Thailand. We
know that the outbreak is just the beginning. However, the COVID 19 outbreak
control in Taiwan can be considered as a success case. Possible explanations for
that can be effective containment and or extensive COVID-19 screening, effective
patient triage, and contact tracing ([19]; [12]).

In contrast, the United States of America, Spain, Italy, and Germany are the
top four countries in the total number of cases of COVID 19. We have to analyze
the results from the United States of America carefully, especially the estimates
of upper asymptotes. Once that the standard errors are quite high. However,
we can state that likely the USA will have the largest total number of cases of
COVID 19. Additionally, we have to be caution to compare Germany, Italy,
and Spain. Because our model did not take consideration the sub notification,
so the effects such as robust quarantine, early and complete identification and
investigation of all contacts, social isolation, good habits about hygiene etiquette

are confounded by sub notification and delay or mistakes in the recorded of the
cases [27].
Results from AIC values (tables 1 and 2) revealed that the logistic model was
the best only to data of China and Taiwan. [15] also analyzed data from China
using Gompertz and Logistic Model. They also concluded that Logistic was
the best model We already expected that Gompertz would be the best model
for the majority of the models because the logistic curve has radial symmetry
concerning the point of the inflection, which is rare for the spreading of diseases
[25].

have a fast growth of outbreak and low total cases at the end. Philippines’ prior
distribution means slow growth and moderate total cases. And for the United
States of America, slow growth and high total cases. The maximum likelihood
estimates for upper asymptote were not used directly. As described in the
method section, an equivalent total number was computed first. This step of
statistical analysis try to answer the following question: Which country the
Goias COVID 19 outbreak curve resembles?

maximum likelihood estimates from data of other countries
According to the WAIC criterion, the Goias COVID 19 outbreak curve is
closer to the USA curve. It does not mean that the Goias state will have
the total number of cases of COVID 19 approximately equal to the USA. Or
even the same prevalence rate. It means there is a resemblance between two
curves. Furthermore, the US dataset maximum likelihood estimates used as
prior provides the predicted values more accurate among all prior distributions
used so far.
The resemblances between the two curves allow us to make some comparisons. As much the USA as the Goias state did not do massive COVID 19
screening in their respective populations. There is no contact tracing of the
infected in both locations. It was not done any prevention on airports, bus
stations, and roads at the beginning of the outbreak.
Due to the high degree of uncertainty about upper asymptote, we decide
to carry out an extra model with flat priors from the USA data set maximum
likelihood estimates. Table 4 shows the results of the Bayesian inference for
Gompertz with priors defined by A ∼ N (23000, 500000), Kg ∼ N (0.08, 0.01),

The Gompertz model was the best using WAIC. The estimate of the data of
the outbreak peak is 60 days after the beginning. The 95 % credibility interval
indicates that the outbreak data can be ranges between 51 and 68 days after
the outbreak initial. The estimate of the plateau is around 3180 cases, which
corresponds to a prevalence rate of 4.53 per 10000 inhabitants. Figures 4 and 5
show the forecast for the total number and new daily cases.

Discussion

In this study, we presented a Bayesian method to predict the total number and
daily new cases of the COVID 19 in the Goias state, Brazil. In this section, we
are going to make comments about some technical aspects of statistical analysis
and use of the results.
Firstly, why do we adopt Bayesian analysis? What are the strength and
drawbacks of this sort of analysis? Researchers quite often use the compartment
models to make predictions about infectious disease outbreaks ([27]; [19];[18]
). This sort of model can be useful to make predictions before the outbreaks
begin. However, these models do not take into account real data because they
are mathematical models, frequently based on differential equations. There is
no consensus in the literature about some disease information, for example, the
infectious period of asymptomatic person, fatality rate. On the other hand,
the frequentist statistical analysis only takes into consideration the data itself,
and in our case, we have few data available for Goias state. We believe that
situation leads naturally to a Bayesian statistical analysis [7]. We prefer to use
information about other countries as priors, rather than only an expert opinion.
Because the disease still is new, and some aspects continue no revealed.
The priors distributions based on countries’ information revealed influential.
Hence, after sensibility analysis, we defined another one with higher variance,
allowing that parameters also learn from the data itself.
Results from Bayesian Analysis revealed reasonable. The expected prevalence rate for Goias state is around 4.53 per 10000 inhabitants. South Korea
recorded a prevalence rate equal to 2.06 until April 15, 2020. We already expect these results, considering the control measures made by both governments.

Figure 3: Total number of cases of COVID 19 in the State of Goias, Brazil, and

Goias is not the COVID 19 epicenter in Brazil. It is only the twelfth most
populous state. For example, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states are more
populous and have more international air traffic, which explains more cases
recorded. Probably this is a reason that Goias will have a prevalence rate much
less than the USA, which recorded 19.48 on April 15, 2020.

Limitations

Our model does not take into consideration changes in the disease notification
politics and or quarantine or social isolation measure. So any changes made in
this sense can alter the efficiency of this prediction. Also, the model ignores the
sub notification problem. The target population of this study is the potential
patients that can need public health facilities and resources in general. The
asymptomatic and mild symptomatic are not the target. Hence, we do not
recommend the use of the model to discuss the period of quarantine. However,

we believe that the results of this study are enough to help the authorities in
public health to make decisions.

Conclusion

We conclude that the method can be useful, and we hope this study can provide
some valuable information to public health management.
