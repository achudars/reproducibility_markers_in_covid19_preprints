Adverse patient safety events were associated with 110 thousand deaths in the U.S. alone in

2

2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has further challenged the ability of healthcare systems to

3

ensure medication safety, and its effects on patient safety remain unknown. Here, we inves-

4

tigate negative outcomes associated with medication use before and during the pandemic.

5

Using a dataset of 10,443,476 reports involving 3,624 drugs and 19,193 adverse events, we de-

6

velop an algorithmic approach to analyze the pandemic’s impact on incidence of drug safety

7

events by evaluating disproportional reporting relative to the pre-pandemic time, quantifying

8

unexpected trends in clinical outcomes, and adjusting for drug interference. Among 64 ad-

9

verse events identified by our analyses, we find 54 have increased incidence rates during the

10

pandemic, even though reporting of adverse events has decreased by 4.4% overall. We find

11

clinically relevant differences in drug safety outcomes between demographic groups. Com-

12

paring to male patients, women report 47.0% more distinct adverse events whose occurrence

13

significantly increased during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic levels. Out of 53 ad-

14

verse events with the pre-pandemic gender gap, 33 have increased gap during the pandemic

15

more than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. While musculoskeletal

16

and metabolic side effects are disproportionately enriched in women during the pandemic,

17

immune-related adverse events are enriched only in men. We also find the number of ad-

18

verse events with a higher reporting ratio during the pandemic in adults is higher (16.8%)

19

than in older patients (adjusted for population size). Our findings have implications for safe

20

medication use and public health policy and highlight the role of variation in adverse events

21

for improving patient safety during a public health emergency.

Introduction

23

Adverse events from medications [1–10] accounted for over 110,000 deaths in the U.S. alone in

24

2019. Despite urgent implications [11–13], it remains largely unknown how the COVID-19 pan-

25

demic [14–22] influenced patient safety and what inequalities in diverse patient populations are

26

exacerbated more than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. Actionable

27

strategies are needed that can reveal variation in outcomes between patient groups, underlying

28

disorders, and drug classes across the entire range of human diseases and approved drugs. How-

29

ever, intricate dependencies between the pandemic’s effects, safety profiles of drugs, and patient

30

characteristics [23–25] present challenges for extracting actionable insights about patient safety.

31

Prior studies on adverse events have focused on laboratory environments, molecular char-

32

acterization of drugs and target proteins, and limited clinical trial observations [26–29]. Studies

33

examining reports of adverse events in the context of the pandemic were limited to very restricted

34

pairs of drugs and adverse reactions, small numbers of reports, and narrow time ranges [30–32].

35

Further, such narrowly focused analyses can be confounded by historical biases in adverse event

36

reporting and by mixing population groups that differ in their relative risks for clinical events.

37

We systematically investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of adverse drug

38

reactions using a population-scale patient safety dataset. We analyze 10,443,476 adverse event re-

39

ports spanning 19,193 adverse events and 3,624 drugs to reveal previously unknown impacts of the

40

pandemic on drug safety and identify variation in adverse events across diverse patient populations.

41

Disentangling confounders (such as sampling variance and temporal biases in reporting of adverse

42

events), our algorithm identifies sex- and age-related variations in adverse events and demographic

43

groups who are at higher or lower risk for adverse events during the pandemic than in the pre-

44

pandemic time. The analyses enable insights into the inter-correlated adverse events, distill drug

45

safety signals, and yield hypotheses based on risk-altering interactions to inform drug prescription.

46

We also present a comprehensive catalog of adverse events that can serve as a valuable resource

47

to discover relationships between drugs and safety events, especially in cases of rare events and

48

effects within population subgroups that differ in their risks of specific clinical outcomes and are

49

disproportionately affected by preventable inequities.

53

from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)

54

dataset, collected from January 2013 to September 2020. To support safety surveillance of thera-

55

peutic products, the FAERS stores anonymized, manually reviewed adverse event reports received

56

by the FDA. We use the dataset to detect adverse events that are significantly associated with

57

the pandemic, pinpoint clinically relevant drugs strongly connected with adverse drug events, and

58

identify disparities in the distribution of adverse events across sex and age. To this end, we de-

59

velop an approach that identifies clinically meaningful adverse events that meet three criteria: i)

60

the reporting frequency of the adverse event changed significantly between 2019 and 2020, ii) the

61

change cannot be explained by its trend in previous years (2013 to 2019), and iii) the adverse drug

62

reaction is strongly associated with at least one drug and cannot be explained by drug interference.

63

Corresponding to these three criteria, our approach contains three key components (Fig-

64

ure 1a). First, we estimate the reporting odds ratio of adverse events to detect those whose inci-

65

dence has considerably shifted during the pandemic (Figure 1b; Eq. 2; Methods). Among those

66

adverse events we then focus on those whose change in reporting frequency can not be explained

67

by the expected upward or downward reporting trajectories had the pandemic not occurred. For

68

that, we define Pandemic-Adverse Event Association Index (PAEAI) to quantify the effects of

69

the pandemic on the incidence of adverse events (Eq. 3; Methods). We retain only adverse event

70

associations with positive PAEAI values (Figure 1c), meaning that the their incidence in 2020 is

71

significantly different than predicted on the basis of temporal trends. Third, our approach identifies

72

adverse events with considerable associations to specific medications (Figure 1d; Eq. 4; Methods),

73

omitting drugs withdrawn from the market in 2020. Resulting drug-adverse event pairs represent

74

co-occurring drugs and adverse events whose reporting frequency has considerably changed during

75

the pandemic (Eq. 5; Methods).

76

Taken together, these three components specify a model that can analyze any patient cohort

77

formed in a diverse population, extract associations between drugs and adverse events and relations

78

between adverse events and patients, and quantify differential reporting patterns to identify high-

79

risk demographics groups.

80

Variation in drug adverse events before and during the pandemic

81

We find the majority of adverse events identified by our approach have increased reporting fre-

82

quency during the pandemic, despite a 4.4% decrease in the total number of reports submitted by

83

healthcare professionals from 220,920 in 2019 to 211,152 reports in 2020. Confirming the validity

84

of our approach, the model detects a significant increase in incidence of five adverse events di3

85

rectly related to COVID-19, such as coronavirus infection, coronavirus test positive, COVID-19,

86

suspected COVID-19, and COVID-19 pneumonia (all p-value < 10−37 , Fisher’s exact test): we

87

exclude these from the rest of our analyses. The model detected 64 unique adverse events whose

88

incidence changed during the pandemic in the overall population: 54 of which have increased re-

89

porting frequency during the pandemic, while only 10 decreased in frequency (SI Figure S1). We

90

define adverse drug reactions whose reporting frequency has disproportionately increased with the

91

pandemic onset as enriched, and those with significantly decreased reporting frequency as purified.

92

Among the 54 enriched adverse events, delusion has the greatest association with the pandemic,

93

with the largest PAEAI score of 1.95 (statistics for more adverse events in SI Table S1). The vol-

94

ume of FAERS reports involving drug-related premature delivery increased 73.4%, despite studies

95

from the US and Europe finding a decrease in the overall incidence of preterm births during the

96

pandemic [33–35]. Similarly, the incidence of drug-related bladder cancers increased by 147%,

97

despite overall decrease in cancer diagnoses after the onset of the pandemic [15]. The frequency of

98

hallucination side effects increased 138% during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic,

99

which could be related to reports linking paranoia about COVID-19 to hallucinations, as well as

100

the neurological impacts of the disease itself [36, 37]. Our framework also detects large increases

101

for severe side effects, such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. The domination of adverse

102

events with increased frequency is consistently observed in most demographics across sex and age.

103

For instance, in patients over 65 years old, 18 out of 19 identified adverse events are enriched, and

104

only one is purified (SI Figure S1).

105

Women suffer from more drug adverse events than men relative to pre-pandemic levels

106

While our approach detected 38 adverse events that increased in frequency in women (SI Table S3),

107

only 16 enriched adverse events were detected in men (SI Table S2; Figure 2a). This finding is

108

consistent with that 62.0% of all reports in FAERS are from women and only 38.0% from men

109

(excluding reports with unknown sex). Even after normalizing to the greater number of female

110

patients in FAERS, there are still 48.5 enriched adverse events per million female patients, which

111

is 47.0% higher than 33.0 per million male patients. Moreover, 32 out of the 38 side effects are

112

enriched only in women, while only 10 out of 16 are enriched only in men (Figure 3a). The model

113

identifies 6 adverse events enriched in both women and men. For example, respiratory arrest has

114

similar PAEAI in males (0.80) and females (0.74), suggesting that pandemic has a comparable

115

influence on men and women regarding the incidence of respiratory arrest. In contrast, the con-

116

fusional state has a higher PAEAI in women (0.94) than in men (0.26), suggesting that changes

117

brought on by the pandemic exert greater influence on the incidence in female patients.

118

Proportion of female patients increased across most enriched adverse events

119

Next, we assess the proportion of female patients in each of 54 side effects that were enriched in

120

the overall population, comparing the proportion before and during the pandemic (Figure 2d). We

121

exclude premature delivery, for which all patients are female. We find the proportion of female

122

patients increased in 40 out of 53 adverse events during the pandemic. The two adverse events

123

with the largest increases are reduced visual acuity, where the proportion of women increased from

124

53.8% to 75.2%, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, where the proportion of women increased

125

from 18.4% to 39.0%. We find the proportion of women in drug-related anxiety reports increased

126

from 67.8% to 72.3%, confirming that women report anxiety at higher rates during the pandemic

127

than men [38]. We observe an increase in the proportion of reports for side effects associated with

128

anxiety disorders: insomnia, dysponoea (shortness of breath), and dizziness, but find a decrease in

129

side effects commonly associated with psychosis disorders: delusion, hallucinations, and dementia.

130

Our analyses identify 13 adverse events for which the proportion of female patients has de-

131

creased while the proportion of male patients increased (SI Figure S7). For example, the proportion

132

of hypogammaglobulinaemia reports with female patients dropped steeply from 70.6% to 41.2%

133

during the pandemic. As patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia are immunocompromised and at

134

higher risk for COVID-19, this finding warrants investigation into why the incidence of hypogam-

135

maglobulinaemia decreased in women and if there is an increase in undiagnosed cases.

136

Variation in drug adverse events across age groups

137

Stratification of patients by age groups (Figure 3b) reveals one enriched adverse event in young

138

patients (SI Table S4), 35 in adults (SI Table S5), and 18 in elderly patients (SI Table S6). Even

139

after accounting for the differences in the size of each patient cohort, there are still 68.8 side effects

140

per million adults with increased reporting frequency during the pandemic, which is greater than

141

the 27.8 side effects per million young patients and 58.9 adverse events per million elderly. The

142

one side effect enriched in young patients, pyrexia (PAEAI =1.08), is similarly enriched during the

143

pandemic in adults (PAEAI =1.22), but is not significantly impacted in the elderly.

144

Twenty-eight out of the 35 enriched adverse events in adults are unique to adults (not asso-

145

ciated with young or elderly patients). For example, drug-related jaw pain has increased incidence

146

in adult patients during the pandemic (PAEAI = 1.61) but not in young or elderly patients. Six

147

adverse drug reactions are enriched in both adult and elderly patients (cardiac arrest, rectal haem5

148

orrhage, neuropathy peripheral, acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, and neoplasm

149

progression). While most have similar PAEAI scores in both cohorts, acute kidney injury has a

150

PAEAI of 1.28 in adults in contrast to 0.81 in elderly patients, suggesting an age-related disparity

151

in the pandemic’s impact on this particular side effect. Twelve adverse events are uniquely enriched

152

in elderly, including five mental health-related events (hallucination, delusion, aggression, abnor-

153

mal behaviour, and dementia). This finding is in contrast with earlier surveys [39, 40] showing

154

lower rates of overall anxiety-, depression-, and stress-related disorders in the elderly compared to

155

younger age groups and suggests that drug-induced psychiatric effects may need to be addressed

156

differently by healthcare systems.

157

Variation in adverse events across organ systems

158

We divide 54 adverse events found to be enriched in the overall population into 19 categories based

159

on the System Organ Classification (SOC; [41]) (Figure 2a; SI Figure S2-S3). Nervous system

160

and vascular side effects are the most common, with nine and seven adverse events, respectively,

161

suggesting the incidence of these two adverse event classes are more susceptible to changes brought

162

on by the pandemic. This finding points to the evidence suggesting COVID-19 has a significant

163

impact on the vasculature and increases the risk of developing neurologic disorders [42, 43].

164

Ten adverse events have their reporting frequency disproportionately decreased during the

165

pandemic, four of which are urinary system disorders and two are blood-related adverse events

166

(SI Figure S3). Although the incidence proportion are decreased in reports submitted by pro-

167

fessional healthcare workers, we find five adverse events (infective pulmonary exacerbation of

168

cystic fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, osteonecrosis of jaw, renal injury, and nausea) have more

169

self-reported cases (submitted by customer themselves) during the pandemic in contrast to before

170

pandemic (SI Figure S8-S9). In particular, reports of kidney injury have dropped dramatically

171

among professionals, but have risen sharply among non-professionals, suggesting an unmet need

172

for pharmacovigilance in drug-related renal injury during the pandemic.

173

Next, we investigate the SOC classes of adverse events enriched in demographic groups.

174

(Figure 2a). Our approach identifies 38 adverse events that are enriched in female patients and

175

distributed across 14 SOC classes with most common being nervous system, musculoskeletal,

176

vascular, and respiratory disorders (SI Figure S2-S3). In male patients, 16 enriched adverse events

177

spread across seven SOC classes with most common being vascular and psychiatric disorders.

178

Blood and immune system disorders are enriched only in men but not women. In contrast, side

179

effects in nine SOC classes are only overrepresented in women, but not men, including metabolism,

180

musculoskeletal, skin, infections, and pregnancy-related disorders. Although psychiatric adverse

181

events are enriched in both men and women, there are four psychiatric side effects in men, and only

182

two in women: hallucination is enriched in both; the incidence of anxiety is increased in females

183

but not in males, while alcoholism, delusion, and dementia are only enriched in male patients.

184

Psychiatric adverse events are overrepresented in the elderly, with five enriched adverse

185

events, compared to only one in adults: lending further support to our finding that the elderly

186

may be differentially susceptible to psychiatric side effects of medications. In particular, halluci-

187

nation, delusion, abnormal behaviour, aggression, and dementia are enriched in the elderly but not

188

adults, while anxiety is only enriched in adults. Moreover, in the elderly, we observe one eye- and

189

one ear-related adverse events (vitreous floaters and hypoacusis, respectively), but do not detect ei-

190

ther in adults. Across sex and age cohorts as well as in the overall population, vascular-related side

191

effects are enriched, suggesting it is a class of adverse drug reactions whose incidence is widely

192

impacted by the pandemic.

193

Pre-pandemic gender differences are exaggerated during the pandemic

194

We further investigate gender disparities among the enriched adverse events, and whether any pre-

195

existing gender gaps changed during the pandemic. In the overall population, gender disparities

196

are observed in all of the 53 adverse events before the pandemic, and we find that these gender

197

disparities are exacerbated during the pandemic in 41 out of 53 adverse events (Figure 2c). For

198

example, before the pandemic there were 330 more female patients report drug-related pneumonia

199

than male patients: during the pandemic, the gap nearly tripled to 919 reports. The gender gaps

200

normalized by population size are shown in SI Figure S4-S6. Similarly, there are 877 more reports

201

from female patients of urinary tract infections (UTIs) than male, consistent with anatomical and

202

clinical evidence that women are more susceptible to UTIs [44]; the gender gap has increased to

203

1,223 reports during the pandemic. In contrast, hallucination showed almost no gender disparity

204

(15 cases) before the pandemic. Yet after the pandemic, male patients are overrepresented com-

205

pared to women with a large margin (243 cases). Among the 41 adverse events with an increasing

206

gender gap, 33 involve more female patients than male patients during the pandemic (Figure 2c),

207

which is consistent with the historical exclusion of women from clinical trials [3]. During the

208

pandemic, the largest gap is observed in dyspnoea, with 3,921 reports from female patients and

209

only 1,866 reports from male patients. The second-largest gap is observed in arthralgia with 2,424

210

reports involving women and only 983 reports for men.

211

Considering adults and elderly, we observe a similar increase in pre-existing gender dispari7

212

ties. Among 35 adverse events enriched in adults during the pandemic, 24 have gender inequality

213

(10 are only reported in unknown sex, excluding premature delivery). We find that 21 out of 24

214

adverse events have a larger gender gap after the onset of the pandemic. Among 21 drug reac-

215

tions with exacerbated gender difference, 18 involve more women than men during the pandemic

216

(Figure 3c; Figure S5 is adjusted for population size). In elderly patients (Figure 3d; Figure S6 is

217

adjusted for population size), gender disparities exist in 14 out of 18 enriched adverse events (four

218

are only observed in unknown sex). The gender disparities increased in 13 out of 14 drug reactions

219

during the pandemic; eight are female-related adverse events and five are male-related adverse

220

events. The gender disparity in UTIs increased during the pandemic in the elderly but not in adult

221

patients, concordant with evidence that postmenopausal women are most at risk for UTIs [44].

222

Gender differences across drug-associated adverse effects

223

To examine the landscape of gender differences in drug safety, we constructed a network of drug-

224

adverse event associations that are significantly enriched after the onset of the pandemic in women

225

(Figure 4a) and men (Figure 4b). We find that women have 169 enriched associations between

226

drugs and adverse reactions while men only have 51, lending further support to our findings that

227

the pandemic exerted a greater influence on the side effect landscape for women.

228

Several features of the enriched drug-adverse events networks are shared between men and

229

women, such as the cluster of haemotoxicity-associated drugs and the cluster of haemorrhage-

230

related side effects associated with Rivaroxaban. In both networks, cardiac and respiratory arrest

231

are associated with a similar cluster of nervous system-related drugs, including common Benzo-

232

diazapines and Opioids such as Fentanyl, Oxycodone, Methadone, and Diamorphine. Many of

233

these drugs are known to be highly addictive and sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic has

234

impacted the ongoing substance abuse epidemic [45, 46]. Moreover, Methadone is only enriched

235

in women, while Diamorphine is only enriched in men, suggesting a potential gender difference in

236

the use of addictive substances.

237

A major difference between the two networks is the large cluster found only in the female

238

network. This cluster includes anxiety and closely associated side effects (such as dizziness, in-

239

somnia, palpitations, and dysponea): consistent with numerous studies that women are more likely

240

to report a mental health disturbance during the pandemic [47–49]. Comparing drugs present

241

across the female and male networks is hindered by lacking information on total drug usage in

242

the FAERS dataset. However, both Sildenafil and Tadalafil are located within the center of the

243

female-specific cluster, two drugs whose on-label use is for erectile dysfunction. Despite majority

244

of usage being in men, both drugs are found only the female cluster. Both have off-label uses for

245

treating sexual dysfunction in women, highlighting our method’s ability to detect potential adverse

246

events of off-label drug usage, and to overcome the limitation of differences in drug usage. There

247

are 35 drug-adverse events associations enriched in only male patients. For instance, an associa-

248

tion between alcoholism and Naltrexone is enriched in men, but not women, indicating a gender

249

disparity in the previously documented rise in alcohol use during the pandemic [50].

250

We separately analyze associations with Remdesivir as the first treatment for COVID-19

251

to receive emergency approval [51]. Remdesivir presents in both male and female networks and

252

shows association with cardiac arrest. Analyzing differential rates of adverse events in patients re-

253

porting use of Remdesivir, we note that female patients are at increased risk for hypoxia, hypoten-

254

sion, and renal impairment, while in the male network, Remdesivir is connected to respiratory

255

failure. These adverse events have been reported in Remdesivir clinical trials [52, 53], but are very

256

rare (cardiac arrest, 1/155 patients; renal impairment, 4/53; hypotension, 4/53; respiratory failure

257

2/53) [54] and the trials fail to provide any differential drug effects for distinct patient subsets;

258

the literature does not reveal the association with hypoxia (ROR=7.05; p-value < 10−36 , Fisher’s

exact test). The detection of Remdesivir-associated adverse events highlights the importance of

260

population-scale patient safety datasets to detect rare adverse events and unexpectedly high-risk

261

demographic subgroups. As more clinical treatments and vaccines receive emergency use autho-

262

rization, rapidly detecting rare adverse events and stratifying at-risk populations will be critical to

263

patient safety.

Discussion

265

Here we demonstrate the effectiveness of population-scale patient safety data in revealing demo-

266

graphic variation of drug adverse events during a public health crisis. Using 10,443,476 reports

267

that span 3,624 approved drugs and 19,193 unique adverse events, our algorithmic approach quan-

268

tifies reporting patterns within and across diverse patient cohorts to flag at-risk demographics and

269

identifies relationships between adverse events and drugs.

270

Our analyses quantify associations between adverse events and the pandemic and discovers

271

inequalities across patient subpopulations, paving the way for future research to identify medi-

272

cal and non-medical factors driving the inequities. The approach detects population specific side

273

effects supported by the literature, such as increased susceptibility of women to anxiety related

274

effects and the age and gender disparity in urinary tract infections. It also detects side effects

275

that contradict the literature (e.g., increased susceptibility of the elderly to drug-related psychiatric

276

events, despite documented resilience to psychiatric disorders). The models detect novel, rare ad-

277

verse events, such as hypoxia as a side effect of Remdesivir, highlighting the role of algorithmic

278

models for pharmacosurveillance of treatments granted emergency approval.

279

The power to detect subtle patterns of drug safety depends on the algorithm’s ability to

280

exclude potential confounding factors. To account for well-recognized confounding factors, we

281

directly compare reports submitted in 2020 to those in 2019 and use temporal prediction between

282

2013 and 2020 to identify drug safety events whose reporting changed during the pandemic more

283

than expected had the pandemic not occurred. Further research is necessary to pinpoint driving

284

factors that made the landscape of patient safety so different with the pandemic onset, including

285

altered drug usage [55], limited access to healthcare resources [56], and changes to human behavior

286

(like less physical activity [57]). There is an important limitation to consider in interpreting our

287

findings. The patient safety dataset comprises voluntarily submitted reports that are not necessarily

288

representative of prevalence rates of adverse drug reactions [58]. Further, the pandemic has likely

289

affected reporting rates, which can vary across adverse events and time [9]. Interestingly, the total

290

number of adverse event reports decreased in 2020 relative to 2019. Nevertheless, we find that

291

adverse events whose reporting frequency has changed relative to pre-pandemic levels (Figure 1b)

292

tend to be reported considerably more often than expected based on historical data (Figure 1c).

293

This observation, together with abundant research on clinically relevant insights extracted from

294

patient safety datasets [59–64], further strengthen confidence in our key findings.

295

Our algorithmic approach can identify differential reporting patterns in patient cohorts formed

296

as a function of gender, age, adverse events, and drugs. With additional information on medical and

297

non-medical patient characteristics such as race and ethnicity, the approach is suitable for system-

298

atic safety surveillance to pinpoint individuals at high risk for safety events based on risk-altering

299

interactions. We also present a new resource of adverse drug effects and drug-event associations

300

for use in pharmacoepidemiology and public health policy to inform medication use in diverse

301

populations. We expect this algorithmic approach to enable comparison of COVID-19 pandemic

302

to other health emergencies (like nationwide opioid crisis in the U.S. and emergencies as the result

303

of hurricanes and wildfires) to unveil the disruptive nature of public health crises on patient safety.

Figure 1: Population-scale model of patient drug safety. (a) Our algorithmic approach detects drug safety signals that are significantly associated with the pandemic by leveraging large-scale adverse event (AE) reports’ information about drugs and associated
adverse reactions. The approach can be applied to any patient cohort; in the overall patient population, it identifies 64 among 19,193
adverse events. (b) Disproportionality estimation. Adverse events with p-value < 0.05 (Bonferroni-corrected) and whose 95% CI
of ROR does not cross one are retained. In the overall population, this yields 105 adverse events: 72 enriched (overrepresented)
and 33 purified (underrepresented). (c) AE reporting trajectories. We define PAEAI to characterize the temporal trend of adverse
events’ reporting frequency (Methods) and only keep those with positive PAEAI, indicating a large margin between expected and
observed reporting. Shown are trajectories of cardiac arrest (left; PAEAI =1.05; R2 =0.49; keep) and palpitations (right; PAEAI =
-0.54; R2 =0.81; drop). (d) Drug interference. We first examine the association between adverse events and drugs, if significant,
then measure the association between the formed drug-adverse event pair and the pandemic. We only retain adverse events that are
significantly associated with at least one drug that makes the established pair significantly related to the pandemic (scenario 3). (e)-(f)
Demographic information before and during the pandemic. The width of bars is proportional to the number of AE reports. Shown are
adverse drug reactions with PAEAI > 0.8 and are enriched in women. The total number of reports in women significantly increased
(p-value < 0.05, Student’s t-test) during the pandemic, but remained largely unchanged in men, implying an increased gender gap.
The difference between widths of input and output streams in women/men are due to reports with unknown age. ROR: reporting
odds ratio; CI: confidence interval; AR(2): second-order autoregressive model (see Methods).

Figure 2: Distribution of detected adverse events. (a) Distribution of adverse drug reactions across System Organ Classes (SOC).
Values listed indicate the number of averse events associated with each patient cohort and are divided into groups by etiology of
adverse events (Methods). In the overall population, nervous and vascular SOCs are most common, with nine and seven side effects,
respectively. The representation of enriched psychiatric adverse events varies: four out of 16 adverse events in men (25%) and five
out of 18 in the elderly (27.8%), compared to only two out of 38 in women (5.3%) and one out of 35 in adults (2.9%). There is one
overrepresented and one underrepresented drug side effect in young patients (SI Figure S2-S3). (b) The proportion of female patients
in the 53 side effects enriched in the overall population (omitting reports with unknown sex and excluding premature delivery which
only occurs in women). In the majority (75.5%) of side effects, female patients account for a higher proportion of reports during
the pandemic, compared to before the pandemic. (c) Changes to gender disparities in the 53 side effects enriched in the overall
population during the pandemic (same 53 as in panel b). The gap in the number of reports for men and women is exacerbated during
the pandemic in most (41/53) of the adverse drug events. We annotate the top five adverse events that have the largest increase
(bolded), with the first number indicating the absolute difference in number of reports, and the number in parentheses showing the
difference normalized by population size. For example, a normalized gap of 4.08 in dysponea indicates there are 4.08 more reports
per thousand women than per thousand men (negative numbers indicate the reporting frequency in women is smaller than in men,
even though the absolute number of reports may be higher in women). Considering incidence proportion (the number of reports per
thousand patients) of adverse events (SI Figure S4): we find that the gender disparity is enlarged in 33 out of 53 the adverse drug
reactions during the pandemic, consistent with the trend observed in the absolute number of reports.

Figure 3: Disparities across gender and age. (a) PAEAI values differ in men and women. Higher PAEAI indicates the incidence of
a drug-related side effect has undergone a greater change during pandemic than pre-pandemic and that change cannot be explained
by temporal trends. We find 10 adverse drug reactions show significant association with the pandemic only in men but not in women,
whereas 31 are associated with the pandemic only in women. (b) Age differences in PAEAI. We find that adults have more drug
adverse events whose reporting frequency was impacted by the pandemic, compared to the young and elderly cohorts. Pyrexia is
significantly associated with the pandemic in both young and adult cohorts. There are no side effects impacted by the pandemic in
both young and elderly individuals. The algorithmic approach detects six adverse drug reactions impacted in both adults and the
elderly. The majority (28/35, 80.0%) of adverse events observed in adult patients are not found in other age groups. In contrast,
there are 12 out of 18 drug reactions in elders are not found in adults. (c) Gender gap in adults (omitting reports with unknown sex).
We detected 35 enriched adverse events in adults, and omitted premature delivery and 10 that were only observed in reports with
unknown sex: leaving 24 with gender difference. Pre-pandemic gender disparities are increased in 21 out of 24 (87.5%) adverse
events, in response to the pandemic. Of these 21 adverse events, 18 have more reports involving women than men, suggesting a
disproportionate vulnerability in adult women for gender disparities. Regarding incidence proportion, we note that the gender gap is
magnified in 70.8% of the adverse events (SI Figure S5). (d) Gender gap in the elderly (omitting reports with unknown sex). In 13
out of 14 adverse drug events (18 adverse events significantly associated with the pandemic in elderly patients, 4 only observed in
unknown sex and omitted), a pre-existing gender gap is intensified during the pandemic. Five among these drug side effects (5/13,
38.5%) are reported in more males than females during the pandemic, while only 3 out of 24 side effects (3/24, 12.5%) in adults:
indicating the gender inequality is mitigated in aged people in contrast to adults. With the onset of pandemic, gender discrepancy (in
terms of incidence proportion) has worsened in 11 out of 14 adverse events where gender inequality previously existed (SI Figure S6;
adjusted for population size).

Figure 4: Gender differences in the drug-adverse event association network. Networks constructed from drug-adverse event
associations disproportionally enriched in women or men. Nodes represent adverse drug reactions (red circles) and drugs (squares).
Node color of drugs is determined by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) [65], dividing drugs into different
groups according to the organ on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. Only nodes with at
least one link are shown. Layout is determined by the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm and manually adjusted for clarity of display.
(a) Drug-adverse event associations enriched in women during the pandemic more than would have been expected had the pandemic
not occurred. (b) Drug-adverse event associations enriched in men during the pandemic more than would have been expected had
the pandemic not occurred. The network in women has more edges (169 associations) than in men (51 associations), suggesting
there are significant levels of drug safety inequities that disproportionately impacted women during the pandemic, compared to men.
Associations between cardiac arrest and nervous system drugs are found in both networks. A link between Remdesivir and respiratory
failure is found in male but not in female patients.

Methods

319

The Methods is structured as follows: 1) description of datasets used, 2) description of the algo-

320

rithmic approach for constructing population-specific models of patient safety.

321

Datasets

322

Population-scale patient safety dataset. The adverse events reports used in this work are from the

323

FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS; https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/

324

FPD-QDE-FAERS.html): a primary source of post-marketing pharmacovigilance. The reports in

325

FAERS mainly contain demographic information (such as age and sex, no personal identifiers),

326

drugs (drug substances) and adverse events (preferred terms in MedDRA; more details in the sec-

327

tion on adverse event identification). We investigate 10,443,476 reports, involving 19,193 adverse

328

events and 3,624 drugs, reported between January 2013 and September 2020. For reports with the

329

same case number, we keep only the latest report. We restrict our analysis to the adverse events

330

occurred in the USA (6,351,817 reports) to alleviate country-wise biases and avoid biases caused

331

by different national surveillance systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pan-

332

demic on March 11, 2020 (retrieved from WHO). The latest available safety reports were submitted

333

on September 30, 2020: thus, we focus on the reports submitted from March 11 to September 30

334

in 2020 and the same period in previous years (from 2013 to 2019), leading to 3,709,531 reports.

335

FDA reporter qualifications. FAERS submissions are voluntarily made by the reporters, who

336

send the reports to the FDA directly or through drug manufacturers. The reporters include health-

337

care professionals (physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dentists, etc.) and non-professionals (lawyers

338

and customers). We investigate the distribution of reporters: physicians (594,787, 16.0%), pharma-

339

cists (282,323, 7.6%), other healthcare professionals (548,261, 14.8%), lawyers (113,744, 3.1%),

340

customers (2,045,491, 55.1%), and unknown reporters (124,925, 3.37%). To increase the validity

341

of our analysis, we focus on the reports submitted by healthcare professionals (1,425,371 reports).

342

Demographic distribution. We further look into the distribution of diverse patient cohorts and

343

find that the proportion of men, women, and unknown sex are 484,649 (34.0%), 784,230 (55.0%),

344

and 156,492 (11.0%), respectively. Based on the aging criteria set by the WHO [66], we split

345

349

nore patients unknown sex when calculating the proportion of female patients in adverse event

350

reports (Figure 2b).

351

Adverse event identification. The drug reactions recorded in FAERS reports are characterized

352

by preferred terms (PT; text string) in MedDRA ontology ((https://www.meddra.org/how-to-use/

353

basics/hierarchy) [41]. We map the adverse events from their PT string in FAERS to the cor-

354

responding MedDRA PT identifier for downstream analysis. One of the major challenges faced

355

by the mapping is that the string names (e.g., ‘Phobia fear \\ Height’) shown in adverse event

356

reports may not match with the standard MedDRA PT names because of nonstandard annotations.

357

Addressing this issue, we propose a simple but efficient mapping strategy which contains three

358

steps. First, we convert all strings into lower case (e.g., ‘phobia fear \\ height’); second, split the

359

string by ‘\\’ if exist, and then separately map the split strings (e.g., ‘phobia fear’ and ‘height’)

360

to MedDRA; third, if none of them match with the standard PT names, we further split the string

361

by ‘ ’ if exist (e.g., ‘phobia’ and ‘fear’) and check the matching (e.g., ‘phobia’ match with Med-

362

DRA ID ‘10034912’). In this way, we can map 98.2% of all the adverse events strings appeared in

363

FAERS dataset, which is higher than most literature (such as [67]). We separately analyze reports

364

with explicit references to COVID-19. That included 6 adverse events (COVID-19 (1,674 reports),

365

COVID-19 pneumonia (135 reports), suspected COVID-19 (103 reports), asymptomatic COVID-

366

19 (14 reports), coronavirus infection (547 reports), and coronavirus test positive (103 reports)).

367

When analyzing gender inequality, we treat sex-specific adverse drug reactions separately. For

368

example, when measuring the impact of the pandemic on the gender gap, we manually excluded

369

premature delivery because it only occurs in female patients.

370

Mapping of adverse events to human organ systems. To explore the disparities among differ-

371

ent parts of human body, we categorize adverse events into higher level, from ‘Preferred Terms

372

(PTs)’ level to ‘System Organ Classes (SOCs)’ level, based on etiology (such as infections and

373

infestations) and manifestation sites (such as gastrointestinal disorders) following the MedDRA

374

hierarchy. We allow selective exclusion before feeding data into the proposed framework. We

375

manually remove the adverse events related to four SOCs (i.e., social circumstances, surgical and

376

medical procedures, product issues, and investigations) that are not related to medication therapies.

377

Furthermore, to increase the robustness and generalizability of the results, we focus on the adverse

378

events that are observed in at least 100 reports either before or during the pandemic.

Mapping of drugs, controlled drug vocabulary, and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical

380

(ATC) classification system. We first map the drugs in the AE reports to DrugBank IDs (https:

381

//go.drugbank.com) [68]. We implement the same mapping strategy as described in the section on

382

mapping of adverse events. We also group drugs into categories given by the Anatomical Ther-

383

apeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The ATC categorization is an internationally ac-

384

cepted classification system maintained by the WHO (https://www.whocc.no/atc ddd index) [65]

385

that classifies active ingredients of drugs according to the organ or system on which they act and

386

their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. For example, drug Ritonavir is anno-

387

tated with ATC codes J05AR10, J05AP53, J05AE03, J05AR23, J05AR26, and J05AP52, indicat-

388

ing that Ritonavir is an antiviral drug used for treatment of HIV and HCV infections.

389

Population-scale adverse event model of patient safety

390

Overview of the approach. The approach receives multimodal information including drugs, ad-

391

verse events, and demographic (e.g., gender and age) from adverse event reports in order to identify

392

the substantial drug side effects that are significantly associated with pandemic, and detect the in-

393

equality among demographic subpopulations. The approach has three components. (1) We first

394

employ disproportionality estimation to identify the adverse drug reactions that are significantly

395

associated with pandemic. (2) We then track the evolving trace of each adverse event between

396

2013 and 2019 and quantify its expected incidence proportion in 2020. We remove the adverse

397

events whose abnormal reporting frequency in the pandemic can be explained by their temporal

398

trend. (3) Finally, we remove drug confounders by considering two kinds of drug interference: we

399

only keep the adverse events that are significantly associated with at least one drug and the formed

400

drug-adverse event pairs are significantly associated with the pandemic.

401

Next, we take the overall population (SI Table S1) as an example to introduce the pipeline of

402

proposed framework. Our model can be flexibly generalized to any demographic subpopulations

403

(such as SI Table S2-S6) by adjusting the input reports. We start with the notation and mathematical

404

representation of the dataset, and then describe details of the three components.

405

Notation and representation of adverse event data. We denote the FAERS dataset as X where

406

each element xi represents a single patient safety report. We use D and S to denote the set of

407

all drugs and adverse events appeared in FAERS dataset, respectively. We regard each report as

408

a tuple including a set of drugs Di , a set of adverse events Si , patient’s age ai , sex gi , weight

18

409

wi , reporter’s qualification qi , severity vector bi , and reporting date ti ; in other words, we have

410

xi = (Di , Si , ai , gi , wi , qi , bi , ti ). The patient may take several medications at the same time and

411

have multiple adverse drug events. Thus, each report contains a drug set Di , which is a subset of D,

412

and each drug dj ∈ Di is represented by its DrugBank ID (string). Similarly, the adverse events set

413

Si ⊆ S contains one or more drug side effects and each sh ∈ Si is represented by its MedDRA ID

414

(string). The patient’s age (in year) ai is represented by an integer; the biological sex is denoted by

415

gi ∈ {1, 2} where 1 denotes male and 2 denotes female; the weight (in kilogram) wi is represented

416

by real number. The reporter’s healthcare qualification qi ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} falls in one of the five

417

categories of physicians, pharmacists, other professionals, lawyers and customers (denoted by one

418

to five). The severity vector bi is a binary vector with six elements, where 1 denotes severity and 0

419

denotes not, corresponding to six outcomes (death, life-threatening condition, hospitalization, dis-

420

ability, congenital anomaly, and other medical conditions) of patient. We represent the reporting

421

date ti by the number of days between the date when the report is submitted and a defined calibra-

422

tion date (January 1, 2000). All the introduced components are used for analysis. For instance, we

423

leverage all the available information (such as demographic data, severity, and submitting date) for

424

patient matching [69–71] in drug interference analysis.

425
426

We denote the set of reports submitted in year k as Xk where k ∈ {2013, . . . , 2020}. The
S
union of every year’s reports equals to the whole FAERS dataset: 2020
k=2013 Xk = X . In contrast

427

to most traditional post-marketing studies which only pay attention to specific or few medica-

428

tions/reactions [3, 72], our research is conducted in a more complex context, involving the time

429

dimension of patient safety data and investigating a large number of drugs/adverse events.

430

To better organize the complex multimodal information, we define logical conditions, which

431

allows us to form a cohort of reports as a function of drugs, adverse events and submitting time. A

432

logical predicate L consists of a sequence of atomic formulas: drug dj , adverse event sh , and year

433

k, which are connected with logical connectives: negation (“not” or ¬), logical conjunction (“and”

434

or ∧), logical disjunction (“or” or ∨), existential quantification (∃), and universal quantification (∀).

435

We use “·” to denote free/unbound variables. As an example, a logical predicate L = (¬dj , sh , ·)

436

denotes the following conjunctive connection: “Report describes a patient who does not take drug

437

dj and Report indicates occurrence of adverse event sh and Report is submitted anytime in 2013-

438

2020 time window.” We define f (L) as a function of L that selects all adverse event reports that

19

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.17.21249988; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

439

satisfy logical predicate L. We formulate the value of f as:
f (dj , sh , k) = f ({AE report | L(AE report(dj , sh , k))}) = N,

(1)

440

where N represents the number of AE reports that satisfy the atomic formulas of drug dj , adverse

441

event sh , and submission time k connected by logical conjunction. Let’s look at an example:

442

f (Pimavanserin, hallucination, 2020) = 1,145 selects a set of reports for which the following

443

holds: “A patient received Pimavanserin treatment and later experienced unwanted side effect

444

of hallucination, and this adverse drug reaction was submitted to the FDA in 2020 (Mar 11 –

445

September 30).” In this particular case, there are 1,145 patients in the FAERS who meet the above

446

requirements.

447

Our approach receives the adverse event data X and identifies adverse events S 0 (S 0 ⊆ S),

448

where each drug side effect s0h ∈ S 0 has a significantly different reporting pattern during the

449

pandemic than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. To that end, we define

450

three reporting odds ratios (RORs [73–75]): β(sh ) measures the association between adverse event

451

sh and the pandemic (SI Table S7); γ(dj , sh ) quantifies the connection between drug dj and adverse

452

event sh (SI Table S8); δ(dj , sh ) estimates the association between drug-adverse event pair (dj , sh )

453

and the pandemic (SI Table S9).

454

Step 1) Disproportionality estimation. We conduct the disproportionality estimation [67, 76] on

455

each adverse event to examine the association between the adverse event and pandemic (March

456

11–September 30, 2020) in contrast to before the pandemic (March 11–September 30, 2019).

457

While disproportionality analysis is an established approach for pharmacovigilance to generate

458

hypotheses on possible causal relations between drugs and adverse effects [72, 77], we here use

459

it in a novel way that quantifying the association between adverse events and their submission

460

periods. For each sh ∈ S, we define β(sh ) to measure the strength of association between sh and

461

pandemic by comparing the reporting frequency during the pandemic with it before the pandemic.

462

Taking sh as input, we calculate β(sh ) as:
β(sh ) =

f (·, sh , 2020)f (·, ¬sh , 2019)
,
f (·, sh , 2019)f (·, ¬sh , 2020)

(2)

463

where f (·, sh , 2020) and f (·, sh , 2019) represent the number of reports involving sh in March

464

11 to September 30 in 2020 and 2019, respectively; f (·, ¬sh , 2020) and f (·, ¬sh , 2019) de20

465

note the number of reports which not contain sh in March 11 to September 30 in 2020 and

467

2019, respectively. We quantify the upper/lower 95% confidence interval (CI) of β(sh ) by
√
ln(β(sh ))±1.96 1/f (·,sh ,2020)+1/f (·,¬sh ,2020)+1/f (·,sh ,2019)+1/f (·,¬sh ,2019)
(SI Table S7). This calculation
e

468

does not consider the constraint of medication.

466

469

We calculate the significance values using the Fisher’s exact test followed by the Bonferroni

470

correction for multiple hypothesis testing. We keep only the adverse events, which pass both the

471

significance test (adjusted p-value < 0.05) and the ROR criterion. Regarding β(sh ), the ROR-

472

based selection criterion is that the lower 95% CI is greater than 1 for adverse events that are

473

reported more frequently during the pandemic (enriched or overrepresented); or that the upper

474

95% CI is less than 1 for adverse events that are reported less often during the pandemic (purified

475

or underrepresented). Unlike previous studies that mainly focused on drug responses with higher

476

ROR (such as ROR > 1) [31], our model able to detect both overrepresnted (β(sh ) > 1) and

477

underrepresented (β(sh ) < 1) adverse events.

478

Step 2) AE reporting trajectories. The reporting trajectory of an adverse event refers to the

479

changing trend of adverse event incidence proportion, indicated by its temporal/historical data.

480

For example, if the reporting frequency of a certain adverse drug reaction has continually increased

481

from 2013 to 2019, it is not surprise that it also grows from 2019 to 2020, and we cannot assertively

482

attribute its overrepresentation to the pandemic. Addressing this issue, we propose a dedicated

483

indicator, pandemic-adverse event association index (PAEAI), to measure whether a medication’s

484

incidence conforms to its trajectory. We next report how to reduce the confounding factor of

485

temporal trend in single adverse event level.

486

We regard March 11–September 30 in 2020 as pandemic period and in previous years (2013

487

to 2019) as non-pandemic periods. For sh which pass the two-fold criterion in previous step, we

488

build its trajectory vector v(sh ) = [vh,2013 , vh,2014 , . . . , vh,2020 ]. Element vh,k represents the pro-

489

portion of reports related to sh in all reports submitted in year k. For example, of the 211,152

490

reports submitted during the pandemic period, 6,130 involve hallucination, which means the pro-

491

portion of hallucination during the pandemic is 2.9% = 6, 130/211, 152. Inspired by the pow-

492

erful temporal feature capture ability of autoregressive method [78], we train a second-order au-

493

toregressive regression (i.e., AR(2)) model for each adverse event by fitting its historical values

494

[vh,2013 , vh,2014 , . . . , vh,2019 ]. The regression models trained on different adverse events do not share

495

parameters. The optimized model is then used to predict the proportion of sh in each year. The

] is from 2015 to 2020 since 2-order AR model need the first

497

two numbers (in 2013 and 2014) as initial inputs. On top of the difference between observation

498

and prediction, we define PAEAI of sh as:
PAEAI(sh ) = log

qresidual
P2020
0
− vh,k denotes
calculated through rk (sh ) = ek (sh )/ (1/6) k=2015 e2k (sh ). The ek (sh ) = vh,k
the residual of sh in year k (from 2015 to 2020).

502

In summary, PAEAI measures the ratio of average standardized residual in the pandemic

503

relative to pre-pandemic. Positive PAEAI indicates the reporting frequency of sh has changed

504

during the pandemic more than would have been expected had the pandemic not occurred. It

505

suggest the adverse event sh is associated with the pandemic factors and cannot be explained by

506

temporal trends based on historic data. Negative PAEAI indicates the change during the pandemic

507

does not exceed expected normal fluctuations of the sh ’s trajectory. A higher value of PAEAI

508

indicates more substantial changes in the reporting frequency of sh . As PAEAI takes the logarithm,

509

a small difference in PAEAI reflects a rather large change during the pandemic relative to pre-

510

pandemic levels. In the next step of the approach we only consider sh with positive PAEAI.

511

Step 3) Drug interference. Next, we reduce the confounding effects of multiple drugs. Tra-

512

ditional pharmacosurveillance typically only concern how adverse events connected to specific

513

therapy [32], however, our approach able to discover multiple drugs that may explain the change

514

of reporting frequency during the pandemic, and control underlying variables in analysis. We

515

consider two types of medication interference:

516

• The first interference is that the adverse event co-occur with a certain drug in safety reports but

517

their association may not significant.

518

• The second interference is that the association between an adverse event and the pandemic can be

519

attributed to multiple drugs, however, none of the formed drug-adverse event pairs is significantly

520

associated with the pandemic.

521

Accordingly, we consider two aspects to prevent drug interference. First, the adverse event (such

522

as hallucination) should be significantly associated with the therapy of at least one drug (like Pi-

523

mavanserin). Second, the formed drug-adverse event pair (like Pimavanserin-hallucination) should

524

be significantly associated with the pandemic.

525

To eliminate the first interference, for a certain adverse event sh that has passed the selection

526

in previous two components, we go through all the drugs that co-occurred with it in adverse event

527

reports during the pandemic (i.e., X2020 ). We use Nsh to denote the set of found drugs for sh .

528

We only check association between sh and dj ∈ Nsh during the pandemic, for simplification, we

529

omit the subscript of year while analyzing the first medication interference. For a specific drug

530

dj ∈ Nsh , we regard the reports where the drug is involved as positive samples (Xdj ), while not

531

involved as negative samples (X¬dj ). All the positive samples are included in a test group Tdj . To

532

keep the comparison fair, we select a subset from negative samples as control group Cdj where the

533

patients have similarly situation with the ones from Tdj (i.e., Tdj = Xdj and Cdj ∈ X¬dj ) [67, 79].

534

The reports in Cdj are selected through a nearest neighbour propensity score matching model [79]

535

which measures the similarity between a report (a patient) from negative samples with a report from

536

positive samples as a function of the patient characteristics. Based on the available information,

537

we build a characteristic factor zi = [ai , gi , wi , qi , bi,1 , . . . , bi,6 , ti ] for each report, including the

538

patient’s age, sex, weight, the qualification of the reporter, severity vector (bi,1 to bi,6 are the six

539

elements in bi ) and the submission date. For each report in test group Cdj , we select 10 reports

540

that have the highest propensity scores into control group [67], which makes |Cdj | = 10|Tdj |. The

541

propensity scores are measured by the cosine similarity among characteristic factor. Afterwards,

542

based on Cdj and Tdj , we define γ(dj , sh ) for each sh and all it’s co-occurred drug dj ∈ Nsh by:
γ(dj , sh ) =

f (dj , sh , 2020)f (¬dj , ¬sh , 2020)
,
f (dj , ¬sh , 2020)f (¬dj , sh , 2020)

(4)

543

where f (dj , sh , 2020) represents the quantity of reports that exposed to a certain drug dj and mean-

544

while emerged the specific drug reaction sh , whereas f (dj , ¬sh , 2020) denotes the number of re-

545

ports that also exposed to dj but not emerged sh ; f (¬dj , sh , 2020) represents the number of re-

546

ports that not involves dj but generated sh , while f (¬dj , ¬sh , 2020) denotes the amount of reports

548

that not involves dj and not contain sh . We quantify the upper/lower 95% CI of γ(dj , sh ) by
√
eln(γ(dj ,sh ))±1.96 1/f (dj ,sh ,2020)+1/f (dj ,¬sh ,2020)+1/f (¬dj ,sh ,2020)+1/f (¬dj ,¬sh ,2020) (SI Table S8).

549

The passing requirements are the 95% CI of γ(dj , sh ) not cross one and the p-value corrected

550

by Bonferroni method smaller than 0.05. To this end, for each sh , we have a drug set Ns0h which is

551

a subset of Nsh , where each drug dj ∈ Ns0h is significantly associated with sh .

547

552

To alleviate the impact of the second interference, we further explore whether each drug-

553

adverse event pair is significantly related to the pandemic in contrast to before the pandemic. We

554

only consider sh that is significantly associated with at least one drug (i.e., Ns0h 6= ∅). We then

555

define δ(dj , sh ), denoting the odds ratio of pair (dj , sh ) (where dj ∈ Ns0h ) during the pandemic,
δ(dj , sh ) =

f (dj , sh , 2020)f (¬dj , ¬sh , 2019)
,
f (dj , sh , 2019)f (¬dj , ¬sh , 2020)

(5)

556

where f (dj , sh , 2020) and f (dj , sh , 2019) denote the number of reports that contains the

557

drug-adverse event pair of interest in 2020 and 2019, respectively; f (¬dj , ¬sh , 2020) and

558

f (¬dj , ¬sh , 2019) denote the volume of reports that not contains the (dj , sh ) pair in

559
560
561
562
563
564

2020 and 2019, respectively. We calculate the upper/lower 95% CI of δ(dj , sh ) through
√
eln(δ(dj ,sh ))±1.96 1/f (dj ,sh ,2020)+1/f (¬dj ,¬sh ,2020)+1/f (dj ,sh ,2019)+1/f (¬dj ,¬sh ,2019) (SI Table S9). The criterion of significance is the same as the previous stage (i.e., 95% CI of δ(dj , sh ) not cross one and
bs and
Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05). Thus, for sh , we have a set of drugs, denoted by N

its changed reporting frequency can be attributed to at least one medication, and the drug-adverse

566

event pair is significantly associated with the pandemic.

567

In summary, each adverse event s0h identified by our approach have multiple defined metrics

568

describing different aspects. The β (along with 95% CI and adjusted p-value) detects the report-

569

ing frequency during the pandemic, which is above (overrepresented) or under (underrepresented)

570

what we expected (see the section on disproportionality estimation). The PAEAI guarantees the

571

abnormal reporting frequency in 2020 can not be explained by its temporal trend from 2013 to

572

2019 (see section on AE reporting trajectories). Each s0h has one or more γ and δ (and corre-

573

sponding 95% CIs and adjusted p-values) to ensure that the changed reporting frequency during

574

the pandemic is not affected by drug interference (see the section on drug interference).
