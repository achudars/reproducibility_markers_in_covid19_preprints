Abstract

2

The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in diagnostic testing. At the

3

beginning of the epidemic, a confluence of factors resulted in delayed deployment of PCR-based

4

diagnostic tests, resulting in lack of testing of individuals with symptoms of the disease.

5

Although these tests are now more widely available, it is estimated that a three- to ten-fold

6

increase in testing capacity will be required to ensure adequate surveillance as communities

7

reopen1. In response to these challenges, we evaluated potential roles of host response-based

8

screening in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Previous work from our group showed that the

9

nasopharyngeal (NP) level of CXCL10, a protein produced as part of the host response to viral

10

infection, is a sensitive predictor of respiratory virus infection across a wide spectrum of

11

viruses2. Here, we show that NP CXCL10 is elevated during SARS-CoV-2 infection and use a

12

CXCL10-based screening strategy to identify four undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in

13

Connecticut in early March. In a second set of samples tested at the Yale New Haven Hospital,

14

we show that NP CXCL10 had excellent performance as a rule-out test (NPV 0.99, 95% C.I.

15

0.985-0.997). Our results demonstrate how biomarker-based screening could be used to leverage

16

existing PCR testing capacity to rapidly enable widespread testing for COVID-19.

The COVID19 pandemic has disrupted normal activity around the globe and has created

20

unprecedented challenges for diagnostic testing. At the start of the pandemic, establishing testing

21

to detect the virus was a challenge, and currently the challenge is capacity. Many experts

22

estimate a need to expand testing capacity up to ten-fold to ensure adequate surveillance as

businesses reopen1. While PCR-based detection of viral genomes is the current gold standard for

24

diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 and is highly specific, this method requires trained laboratory

25

personnel, has multiple steps, and uses costly reagents subject to supply chain disruption. Based

26

on previous work, we hypothesized that an elevated level of the interferon inducible protein

27

CXCL10 in the nasopharynx could serve as a sensitive screen for patients with an active

28

respiratory virus infection including SARS-CoV22. If so, this test could be used as a pre-screen

29

to direct PCR testing to patients most likely to be SARS-CoV2 positive, allowing accurate

30

diagnosis while preserving PCR testing capacity. Protein measurements lend themselves to

31

rapid, high throughput, and point-of care diagnostic methodologies3,4, so this combined strategy

32

offers the potential to have a first step which is sensitive and convenient (CXCL10 assay)

33

followed by a more specific test (PCR) for a subset of screen-positive patients.

34
35

First, we sought to use this strategy to screen for cases of COVID-19 in the Yale-New Haven

36

Healthcare System (YNNHS) beginning in early March of 2020, prior to the start of testing at

37

our institution on March 13 (Fig 1a). The first reported cases of COVID-19 in the region

38

occurred in New York state on March 2nd and in Connecticut on March 9th (Fig S1)5-7. We

39

focused on the time window from March 3rd to 14th, 2020. During this time frame, 642

40

nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were tested by the Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH)

41

clinical virology laboratory using a laboratory developed respiratory virus PCR panel (RVP) that

42

detects 15 common respiratory viruses (Table S1). Of 642 NP samples, 376 were negative for all

43

viruses on the panel, but the SARS-CoV-2 status was unknown.

45

Previously, we found that the CXCL10 level in the NP swab viral transport medium was a useful

46

indicator of infection with many common respiratory viruses2, suggesting that this measurement

47

could be used to indicate which of these 376 samples were most likely to contain a virus not

48

detected by the RVP. NP CXCL10 is expected to be undetectable in healthy subjects. First, to

49

assess whether CXCL10 could be used as a biomarker for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we measured

50

CXCL10 concentration in 39 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive NP swab specimens from the

51

third week of March and compared to levels in the RVP-negative samples from March 3rd to

52

14th. SARS-CoV-2 positive samples showed an average CXCL10 concentration of 681pg/ml

53

(Fig 1b). Notably, the two SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with lowest CXCL10 levels also had

54

very low virus RNA concentrations by RT-qPCR (Ct values for N1 were 36.4 and 34.9). In

55

contrast, the majority of RVP-negative samples had CXCL10 levels at or below the limit of

56

detection, with only 8.5% (32/376) of the samples having CXCL10 levels above a threshold

57

value of 100 pg/ml (Fig 1b). We hypothesized that some of these samples might be from patients

58

with undiagnosed COVID-19.

59
60

Next, we examined the medical records for patient clinical features associated with the RVP-

61

negative, CXCL10-positive samples (Fig 1c). The majority of samples (18/32) were from

62

patients 65 years of age or older. These patients displayed typical symptoms of COVID-19 and

63

other respiratory infections with the most common being fever, cough, and evidence of

64

pneumonia and/or hypoxemia. Most patients in this age group were admitted to the hospital.

65

Nine samples were from patients ages 18-64 and five were from children, who also typically

66

displayed fever and cough, and to a lesser extent other symptoms, and fewer were hospitalized.

67

Then we tested RNA extracted from CXCL10-positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using

68

RT-qPCR. Four of the 32 samples contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and this result was confirmed

69

by the YNHH clinical virology laboratory (Fig 1d). To evaluate the performance of CXCL10 as

70

a pre-screen for virus-positive samples, we also tested the 344 CXCL10-low samples for SARS-

71

CoV-2 RNA, and all were negative. For completeness, we also tested the 266 RVP-positive

72

samples from this time period for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and all were negative. Thus, the four

73

samples identified in the screen were the only SARS-CoV-2-positive among the 642 NP samples

74

tested by RVP in this time frame, and are among the first SARS-CoV-2-positive samples in our

75

health care system.

76
77

The identified SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were collected on March 10th-14th. Three of these

78

samples were from adults, two of whom were subsequently hospitalized for COVID-19.

79

Surprisingly, one sample was from a young child seen as an outpatient. Clinical features

80

associated with each patient presentation are indicated by the letters A-D on Figure 1c.

81
82

To gain further insight into the epidemiology of these early cases of SARS-CoV-2, we

83

performed whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2; data can be visualized

84

at: https://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper3). The full list of

85

genomes included in this analysis and details of genome coverage can be found in Table S2.

86

Interestingly, the four SARS-CoV-2 isolates were genetically distinct. Previous work by our

87

group described a cluster of early cases in Connecticut closely related to strains from

88

Washington State (lineage A1), including the SARS-CoV-2 sequenced from one of these patients

89

(genome Yale-009)8. The other newly sequenced positive cases from this screen (genomes Yale-

90

011, 040 and 151) belong to a distinct lineage (B1). Yale-040 groups within the sub-lineage

91

B1.11, which has Western Europe, likely the United Kingdom, as the most probable origin.

92

Finally, the genomes Yale-040 and 011 are closely related to isolates from New York state but

93

group in different clades (Fig. 2), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 entered Connecticut via multiple

94

independent lines of transmission by early March.

95
96

The fact that all four SARS-CoV-2-positive samples were among the CXCL10-high group (Fig

97

1d) suggested that a CXCL10-based screening strategy might be an efficient way to leverage

98

existing PCR tests to greatly expand testing capacity, due to the high negative predictive value of

99

a negative NP CXCL10 screen. In other words, we would have found all SARS-CoV-2-positive

100

samples even if we had not performed PCR testing on the >90% of samples that were below the

101

100pg/ml CXCL10 cutoff. To further evaluate the performance of this strategy (biomarker based

102

screen followed by PCR test), we next tested a second group of samples – all samples sent to the

103

YNHH laboratory for COVID-19 testing on a single day in March. We chose March 20th, 2020,

104

since we were able to obtain residual samples for all 144 NP swab samples for which SARS-

105

CoV-2 PCR testing was ordered on that date. Since these samples were not pre-filtered to

106

exclude patients with other viral infections, we expected to see a higher rate of CXCL10-positive

107

samples in this sample set than in the RVP-negative samples. We measured CXCL10

108

concentration in all samples. Using the cut-off of 100 pg/ml, 35/144 samples were CXCL10-

109

positive and these included 16/17 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples; conversely, 109/144 samples

110

were CXCL10-negative and these included one SARS-CoV-2-positive sample. Notably, this

111

sample had the lowest viral RNA level of all samples tested that day. Examining the relationship

112

between viral load and NP CXCL10 across all 17 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples revealed a

113

significant positive correlation (Fig 3c). Considering all 144 samples evaluated for suspected

114

COVID-19 on March 20, a negative test for CXCL10 had a very high negative predictive value

115

for SARS-CoV-2 infection (NPV=0.99, 95% C.I. 0.985-0.997), indicating its usefulness as a

116

rule-out test.

117
118

Finally, to better understand the possible uses of CXCL10 in the diagnosis of COVID-19, we

119

studied the correlation between NP CXCL10 level and biological variables using all 59 of the

120

SARS-CoV-2-positive samples in this study (4 from March 3rd to 14th, 17 diagnosed on March

121

20th, and 39 positive control from other dates during the third week of March) (Fig 4a, b).

122

CXCL10 is a chemokine involved in attracting T cells to sites of viral infection, and is a classic

123

interferon stimulated gene (ISG), a gene highly induced by interferon signaling or by activation

124

of intracellular sensors for viral RNA within infected cells9,10. Recent studies of innate immune

125

response to SARS-CoV-2 indicate that the virus triggers a robust antiviral interferon response in

126

the airway11-14. Therefore, we reasoned that NP CXCL10 level might reflect the level of active

127

viral replication, the stimulus for CXCL10 production. Consistently, across all SARS-CoV-2+

128

samples in the study, viral load was positively associated with NP CXCL10 (Fig 4c).

129
130

We also considered that NP CXCL10 level might indicate more robust antiviral responses in the

131

nasal mucosa and therefore might correlate with biological variables associated with lower

132

illness severity. Samples in this study were from patients of a wide age range (Fig 4a, b),

133

enabling analysis of the relationship between viral load and age. Pearson correlation analysis

134

showed a significant negative association between NP CXCL10 and age, with higher NP

135

CXCL10 associated with younger age (Fig 4d). One explanation for the trend towards higher

136

CXCL10 levels in younger patients might be that younger patients had higher NP viral loads;
7

137

however, this did not appear to be the case as there was no clear correlation between age and

138

viral RNA level in this sample set (Fig 4e). An alternate explanation could be that that the

139

antiviral response in the upper respiratory tract is more robust in young patients compared to

140

older patients during SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is also possible that high NP CXCL10 tracks

141

with lower severity of illness; however, since all older patients in this sample set had more

142

severe symptoms and were more likely to be hospitalized (Fig 4b) it was not possible to unlink

143

age from illness severity in this analysis. Further work will be needed to examine this more fully.

144
145

Taken together, the results reported here indicate the potential for host-response based screening

146

to help solve current challenges in diagnostic testing presented by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

147

One major challenge is the need to rapidly expand testing capacity to support surveillance as

148

social distancing measures ease. We show that NP CXCL10 level had a very high negative

149

predictive value for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with a range of symptoms, in which the

150

COVID-19 prevalence was 12% (17/144) (Fig 3). This indicates that, if used as a pre-screen in a

151

similar patient population, this test could potentially eliminate the need for ~80% of PCR tests by

152

screening out samples very likely to be negative for the virus. Although this strategy may not

153

capture every positive case, there also may be some cases in which biomarker based testing is

154

more sensitive than PCR. Based on longitudinal studies, the sensitivity of PCR-based testing can

155

vary considerably even on sequential days in the same patient15-17. It is possible that some of the

156

29 RVP-negative, CXCL10 positive patients in Figure 1 that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2

157

did indeed have COVID-19; however due to study design it is not possible to follow up with

158

patients to further assess. Future longitudinal studies will enable better assessment of the relative

159

sensitivity of CXCL10 and viral PCR for diagnosing COVID-19.

160

This study focused on symptomatic patients. In future studies, it will be important to assess

161

biomarker performance in other populations, particularly if the intention is to screen populations

162

who may have low NP viral loads (e.g. asymptomatic subjects.) Previous studies have shown

163

that induction of host interferon stimulated genes occurs in the nasal mucosa of asymptomatic

164

subjects with respiratory virus infection, but the level of induction may be lower2,18-21. For

165

evaluating such subjects, it will be important to use a CXCL10 assay with a lower limit of

166

detection than the one used here.

167
168

The link between viral replication level and biomarker expression suggests another potential use

169

of biomarkers: assessing transmission risk. Recent work has highlighted persistent NP PCR

170

positivity in patients up to 4 weeks post recovery from COVID-1922,23. This has raised questions

171

about whether these positive tests are detecting infectious virus and a transmission risk, or are

172

simply detecting persistent viral genome fragments or very low levels of virus which are not a

173

transmission risk. A recent report from South Korea found that no transmission occurred to 790

174

contacts of 285 COVID-19 patients who tested positive for viral RNA post recovery24. Since the

175

trigger for CXCL10 production is viral replication, it is possible that this biomarker could serve

176

as a correlate of infectivity, which could be assessed using viral culture. Finding a biomarker to

177

distinguish whether PCR-positivity signifies live/infectious virus will be particularly useful as

178

very sensitive but non-quantitative tests for viral genetic material gain more widespread use,

179

such as in-home point of care tests.

181

In conclusion, we provide evidence based on early cases of COVID-19 in our region that host

182

biomarker-based screening has tremendous potential to solve some of the current challenges

183

presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, including rapidly increasing testing capacity. While

184

diagnostics that detect viral RNA are highly specific, these tests are complex, relatively

185

expensive, and subject to supply chain interruption. In contrast, immunoassay can provide

186

inexpensive, high throughput testing and can be easily adapted to point of care testing. While we

187

previously identified several proteins highly induced during the antiviral interferon response, we

188

focused on NP CXCL10 for this study as it is a well-known molecule for which validated

189

detection antibodies and automated detection platforms already exist. While more study is

190

needed, the work presented here demonstrates the great potential for biomarker-based screening

191

to enable rapid expansion of testing capacity by directing existing testing to samples most likely

192

to be virus-positive.

Fig 1. Screen for undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2, March 3-14, 2020. (a) Number of positive
tests for SARS-CoV-2 by week, Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH). Bracket indicates time frame
chosen for study, March 3-March 14, during which 376 samples tested negative for viruses on the
YNHH 15 respiratory virus panel (RVP). (b) CXCL10 concentration was measured in viral
transport medium associated with 39 COVID-19+ positive cases from the third week of March
excluding March 20 (left) and 376 RVP negative NP swabs from March 3-14 (right). Bracket
indicates RVP- samples with CXCL10 concentrations equal to or above the cutoff of 100 pg/ml.
Limit of detection (L.O.D) of ELISA assay is shown. (c) Clinical presentation of 32 patients from
March 3-March 14 testing RVP-, CXCL10+, by age group. Bar indicates percentage of patients in
each age category displaying the clinical features listed on the y-axis. Letters A-D indicate clinical
features of individual patients who ultimately tested positive for SARS-COV-2 by RT-qPCR.
Clinical data was not available for patient B. (D) All 376 RVP- samples were screened for SARSCoV-2 using RT-qPCR as described in the material and methods. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was
detected in 4 out of 32 CXCL10 positive samples and none of the 344 CXCL10 negative samples,
as shown. Patient age, sample collection date, and site of patient care is indicated for each of the
four positive samples.
