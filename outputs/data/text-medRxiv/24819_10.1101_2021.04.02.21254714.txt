Abstract
Background: Early detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection to improve
disease management, becomes the greatest challenge. Despite high sensitivity of RT-PCR,
not only it was reported that 20-67% of infected patients have false negative results.
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used as a point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2
detection in both pharyngeal and blood specimens. To be less time-consuming, not seem
so costly, and requiring no special training make it more favorable, but the low sensitivity
is the main limitation. Several reports indicated rapid test of blood and pharyngeal
samples has the same sensitivity as the RT-PCR, but some reports have lower sensitivity
especial in asymptomatic patients. Methods: In the present survey, we investigate the
eligible studies for sensitivity and specificity of rapid tests and explore the factors that
influence the result to help better diagnose COVID-19 infection. 20 studies met the
inclusion criteria, which impose 33 different tests. Results: Our findings showed, type of
sample, type of assay, time of sampling, and load of virus influence on sensitivity of RDTs.
Conclusion: This research extends our knowledge of how to improve the sensitivity of
RDTs to better diagnose of infected patients to address the controlling COVID-19
pandemic.
Keywords: RDTs, rapid diagnostic test, RT-PCR, COVID-19, sensitivity, specificity.

Introduction
Early detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection to improve disease
management, becomes the greatest challenge. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was introduced
as a gold standard test in the laboratory. Despite high sensitivity of RT-PCR, not only it
was reported that 20-67% of infected patients have false negative results, but also RTPCR cannot differentiate between infectious and non-infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles
(1,2). Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used as a point-of-care test for SARS-CoV2 detection in both pharyngeal and blood specimens. To be less timeconsuming, not seem so costly, and requiring no special training make it more favorable,
but the low sensitivity is the main limitation. Additional to the rapid antigen (Ag) test, the
rapid antibody (Ab) test was considered as a timely point-of-care test to detect IgG and
IgM Abs in blood, plasma, and serum of patient with COVID-19 (3,4). In a recent study
Ricks et al. analyzed the health system cost and health impact of using RDTs among
hospitalization and mildly symptomatic patient with COVID-19, and report that despite
the low sensitivity of RDTs compare with RT-PCR, is accompanied with "Ag-RDTs have
the potential to be simultaneously more impactful with a lower cost per death and
infectious person-days averted" (5).
Several reports indicated rapid test of blood and pharyngeal samples has the same
sensitivity as the RT-PCR, but some reports have lower sensitivity especial in
asymptomatic patients (6–10). These controversial results may be due to the different
sample types or examined in different infection stages. In the present systematic review,
we attempt to assess the diagnostic utility of antigen detection rapid diagnostic tests for
covid- 19 versus RT-PCR in a different type of samples and different stages of infection
determine the usability of rapid tests in best time and sample.
Materials and Methods
This review was performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) and MOOSE (Meta-analyses Of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines (11,12).
Search Strategy
To evaluate the usability of rapid tests compare with RT-PCR, we systematically searched
the electronic database, including Scopus, Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of sciences

lists of selected articles were hand-searched for additional papers.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (ME and FR) independently screened titles and abstracts of all initially
found articles. Information was extracted from selected studies, including the name of the
author, country, sample size, mean age, rapid diagnostic kits, true positive, false positive,
false negative, true negative results, sensitivity, and specificity. A third reviewer was
consulted to resolve any disagreements between reviewers by discussion until consensus
was reached.
Eligible Criteria
In order to understand the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs, studies that evaluated these
parameters were selected. Inclusion criteria were considered as following: evaluation of
the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs compare to the RT-PCR. All types of studies,
including case/control, cohort, cross-sectional, and clinical trial studies, were included.
Additionally, letter to editors which reported comprehensive data was included. Studies
that evaluated seroprevalence, studies that investigated just cell culture assay, case
reports, reviews, and studies reporting cases with incomplete information were
excluded.
Statistical Analysis
Cochran Chi-square test and I2 were used to assessing heterogeneity among studies. A
fixed-effects model was used when I2 < 50%, while in the case of I2> 50%, a randomeffects model was selected. Fixed-model assumes that the population effect sizes are the
same for all studies (13). In contrast, the random-effects model attempted to generalize

findings beyond the included studies by assuming that the selected studies are random
samples from a larger population (14). To compare the sensitivity and specificity in RDTs
compared with the RT-PCR, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used. According to the
heterogeneity test results, either Der Simonian’s and Laird’s random‑effects method or
Mantel‑Haenszel’s fixed‑effects method were used to estimate the overall sensitivity and
specificity and 95% confidence intervals (15). Moreover, subgroup analysis was
implemented based on the type of specimen (nasopharyngeal swab, throat washing and
bronchoalveolar fluids, and Nasal sample), and symptomatic or asymptomatic patinates
as an important variable which may cause heterogeneity between different samples or
influence of onset of symptoms. The Egger’s test was used to investigate small study
effects due to potential publication bias (16,17). If there was statistical heterogeneity
among the results, a further sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the source
of heterogeneity. After the significant clinical heterogeneity was excluded, the
randomized effects model was used for meta-analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as
statistical significance (2-sided). All data were analyzed using STAT 16 (STATA
Corporation, College Station, Texas).
Result
Overall, 783 studies were initially collected. After removing duplicated studies, 580
studies have remained. During screening titles and abstracts, 165 studies were
considered potentially eligible. Subsequently, in full-text screening, 295 studies were
excluded (Figure 1). Finally, 20 studies met our inclusion criteria, which impose 33
different tests (including 26,056 patients, mea age range from 20.5 to 53.14 years).
Eleven studies (55%) evaluated nasopharyngeal swabs (5,6,8,12–20). Three of included
studies investigated various types of samples with just one assay (18,27,28), whereas
other two articles examined one type of sample with different assays to comparing
sensitivity and specificity (7,9). A single study performed a similar series of experiments
but for rapid Abs tests with finger-stick whole-blood (10), whereas other two studies
were used the same rapid Abs tests from patient’s serum (29,30). Characteristics of
diagnostic values of included studies are shown in Table 1. Forest plots illustrating
sensitivity and specificity for each analysis are seen in Figure 2. The results of Cochrane
Q and I2 statistics showed significant heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity, so
estimations of sensitivity and specificity were obtained using a random effect model. In

further analysis, data were analyzed based on the type of sample and symptomatic or
asymptomatic patients Table S1-S5 and Figure S1-S5. Summary ROC curves constructed
for all assays based on Monte Carlo simulations are shown in Figure 3. It did not apply to
assessing the false results, because 7 studies (35%) did not focus on false results
(7,9,18,22,28,30–32). Some of the current kinds of literature which focused on Ab rapid
tests were excluded due to reporting the results as the separate sensitivity for IgG and
IgM or analyzed data based on onset of symptoms (3,33).
Discussion
Following broad speared spectrum of COVID-19 infection, identified infected patients and
carriers as soon as possible help to better control pandemic. In this line, the RDTs and
rapid Abs test for detecting patients were introduced by WHO in a short time. A large and
growing body of literature has investigated these tests' usability based on their sensitivity
and specificity compared to the RT-PCR. Inconsistency in reported results has heightened
the need for a comprehensive search to achieving a reliable finding. In this regard, in the
present survey, we investigate the eligible studies for sensitivity and specificity of rapid
tests and explore the factors that influence the result to help better diagnose COVID-19
infection.
One important factor that influences the sensitivity of RDTs is a type of sample. Studies
that evaluated different types of samples revealed that nasal examination swabs and
saliva specimens for RDTs are associated with lower sensitivity (27). Our results showed
the most collected samples were nasopharyngeal swabs; in this line, it was shown
examine nasopharyngeal swab, the sensitivity of RDTs results increases (9,38). After
evaluating various specimens, Yamayoshi et al. found that soaking specimen directly to
the lysing buffer can improve RDTs sensitivity (38).
Our analysis has shown the higher sensitivity observes in infected patients with lower Ct
value by RT-PCR. In fact, in asymptomatic patients or patients with lower viral load, the
sensitivity of RDTs decreases (6,8,39). In the subsequent analysis, Cerutti et al. examine
the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ags (R-Ag) among infected patients; they demonstrated that
patients who were positive for R-Ag have higher viral load and lower Ct value are
symptomatic, and this can be an explanation higher RDTs sensitivity in symptomatic
subjects (19). In contrast, Pilarowski et al. reported asymptomatic subjects should not

rule out because regardless of symptoms, it can be possible asymptomatic patients have
a viral load (40). In this regard, to the assessment of RDTs sensitivity, Eshghifar et al. used
various concentration of heat-inactivated COVID-19 virus to assess a cut-off detection for
RDTs; their findings showed, they could not determine a cut-off and reported RDTs to be
positive just in patients with high viral load (28); whereas CK Mak et al. by using cell
culture, the limiting of detection for RDTs reported 18.57 (18).
Additional to the RDTs, some writers compared the sensitivity of cell culture with RTPCR for detecting COVID-19. Like the RDTs, the result showed that in cell culture with
lowing viral load, the sensitivity reduces (8). This can be explained by the fact that
specimens with low viral load or Ct value >30 do not cultured, suggesting low infectivity
of virus (41).
Conducting RDTs with various assays is a serious discussion that can cause emerging
different sensitivity. A study that set out to determine sensitivity of various assay for
RDTs found different results for positive controls in different assays; which could offer
the current methods detect different Ags and subsequently influence test accuracy (32).
The possible interference of time of testing cannot be ruled out. Some researchers
revealed that testing less than 5 days from the onset of symptoms increases sensitivity
(8,9,22,28). It is inconsistent with previous reports that a load of infectious virus
decreases after 7-10 days (9,42). In one recent well-known recent experiment, Albert et
al. with considering the age of participants found the sensitivity of RDTs is lower in
pediatrics than adults (8).
Some recent attention has focused on the benefits of rapid Abs COVID-19 detection as one
of the point-of-care tests. Our findings demonstrated that the rapid Ab detection has
lower sensitivity than RDTs; it is accompanied by high false positives. Pere et al., in their
investigation, showed a history of recent infection with cold Abs increase the false
positive Ab rapid test, especially for IgM, which reduce the validation of the test (10).
Fabre et al. performed a similar survey, but in pregnancy, surprisingly, their findings
showed, the false positive is higher in pregnant women (29). One reason for the low
accuracy of the rapid Ab test can be pointed out to the short-term immunity in such
patients (43).

Much of the current systematic and meta-analysis literature focused on the accuracy of
serological tests, and as the expected, their findings have shown lower accuracy of
serological tests (44–46).
Conclusion
The main goal of the current study was to determine the accuracy of RDTs. This study has
found that generally, as the expected, RDTs have lower sensitivity than RT-PCR; this issue
is affected by several factors such as type of specimen, the timing of sampling, type of
assay, and viral load. This research extends our knowledge of how to improve the
sensitivity of RDTs to better diagnose of infected patients to address the controlling
COVID-19 pandemic.
