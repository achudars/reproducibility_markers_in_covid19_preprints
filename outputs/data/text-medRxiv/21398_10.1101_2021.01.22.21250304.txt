Abstract
Background
Patients with COVID-19 are thought to be at higher risk of cardiometabolic and pulmonary
complications, but quantification of that risk is limited. We aimed to describe the overall burden
of these complications in survivors of severe COVID-19.

Methods
Working on behalf of NHS England, we used linked primary care records, death certificate and
hospital data from the OpenSAFELY platform. We constructed three cohorts: patients
discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19, patients discharged following
hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019, and a frequency-matched cohort from the general
population in 2019. We studied eight cardiometabolic and pulmonary outcomes. Absolute rates
were measured in each cohort and Cox regression models were fitted to estimate age/sex
adjusted hazard ratios comparing outcome rates between discharged COVID-19 patients and
the two comparator cohorts.

Results
Amongst the population of 31,716 patients discharged following hospitalisation with COVID-19,
rates for majority of outcomes peaked in the first month post-discharge, then declined over the
following four months. Patients in the COVID-19 population had markedly increased risk of all
outcomes compared to matched controls from the 2019 general population, especially for
pulmonary embolism (HR 12.86; 95% CI: 11.23 - 14.74). Outcome rates were more similar when
comparing patients discharged with COVID-19 to those discharged with pneumonia in 2019,
although COVID-19 patients had increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05 1.44).

Interpretation
Cardiometabolic and pulmonary adverse outcomes are markedly raised following hospitalisation
for COVID-19 compared to the general population. However, the excess risks were more
comparable to those seen following hospitalisation with pneumonia. Identifying patients at
particularly high risk of outcomes would inform targeted preventive measures.

Introduction
Cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications, especially thrombotic events, have been
described as a key feature of the severe acute phase of COVID-19. A recent systematic review
estimated the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) to be ~15% in hospitalised COVID-19
patients, with higher risks observed in people admitted to intensive care (~30%1–3). Underlying
reasons for this increased risk are likely to be multifactorial, including immobility following
illness/hospitalisation as well as the known association with infection in general, mediated
through interactions with general inflammatory and other immune pathways.4 The possibility that
SARS-CoV-2 may directly trigger pulmonary thrombi via vascular damage and inflammatory
effects in the lung has also been raised.5
As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it is increasingly reported that some patients who
recover from the acute disease phase go on to experience a range of post-recovery clinical
problems. This post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is currently not well described or understood,
with the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence stating that any body system
could be affected, for an undetermined period of time.6 Any such syndrome now needs to be
defined and quantified so that patients and health services can know what outcomes may be
expected, and plan accordingly.6,7 It is also unclear whether COVID-19 is exceptional in its
association with cardiometabolic events, or comparable to other respiratory pathogens, such as
influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which have well-described associations with acute
cardiovascular events.
Work to date on cardiometabolic outcomes with COVID-19 has largely focused on risks during
hospitalisation, with a lack of evidence on how these risks evolve in survivors of severe
COVID-19. We therefore measured the rates of cardiometabolic outcomes in people in England
with COVID-19, focusing on those who were discharged from hospital following the acute phase
of COVID-19. For context, we compared these rates with those seen prior to the pandemic in
both the general population and amongst people discharged following hospitalization for
non-COVID-19 pneumonia.

Methods
Study design and data sources
We conducted an observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from
primary care practices using TPP software linked to Office for National Statistics (ONS) death
registrations and Secondary Uses Service (SUS) data (containing hospital records) through
OpenSAFELY. This is a data analysis platform developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, on
behalf of NHS England, to allow near real-time analysis of pseudonymised primary care records
at scale, currently covering approximately 40% of the population in England, operating within
the EHR vendor’s highly secure data centre.8,9 Details on Information Governance for the
OpenSAFELY platform can be found in the Appendix.

Population
We included all adults aged ≥18 years registered with a general practice for ≥1 year on the
index date with information on age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation. From this source
population we selected three cohorts: all patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in 2020, a
comparison cohort containing all patients hospitalised with non-COVID pneumonia across the
equivalent period in 2019 and a general population frequency matched cohort in 2019. The
COVID-19 and pneumonia cohorts were selected as anyone hospitalised with an associated
diagnostic code for COVID-19 or pneumonia respectively (referred to as the “index
hospitalisation”). The general population cohort was formed by matching each patient in the
COVID-19 cohort to up to five patients eligible on 1st February 2019 in TPP on age (within 1
year), sex and region defined by Sustainability Transformation Partnership level (a more
granular form of England NHS region).

Outcomes and follow-up
We measured eight outcomes: deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE),
ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, acute kidney injury (AKI) and new
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis.
The study periods ran between 1st February and 1st November in either 2019 or 2020,
depending on the population (as defined above). The follow-up period began on the discharge
date of the index COVID-19 or pneumonia hospital stay or 1st February 2019 in the general
population matched cohort. For each analysis, follow-up ended on the earliest of: the first
recorded outcome event, the study end date, or the date of death of the patient. For the AKI
outcome, we excluded patients who were receiving dialysis before the index date (defined as
presence of a dialysis code or eGFR < 15ml/min). For diabetes, we excluded any patients who
had a previous diabetes event, to ensure only incident diagnoses were measured.
Outcomes were defined primarily as the presence of a diagnostic code for each of the
respective outcomes, either in the general practice record, in hospital, or as a cause of death on
a death certificate. For the primary analysis, we excluded use of a GP record if the patient had a

recent outcome recorded within three months before the index date (including if they had been
recorded during the index hospitalisation). This was to prevent double counting of the same
event, for example where a GP updates the record of a patient, recording an event that
occurred during a recent hospitalisation. Sensitivity analyses explored the effect of including
these events (see Statistical Methods).

Statistical Methods
We described the demographics of the three patient cohorts formed: patients discharged from
an admission with COVID-19, patients discharged from an admission with pneumonia and
patients from the general population matched on age, sex and region.
Rates were reported for each outcome, per 10,000 person months, initially for the whole
follow-up time, then stratified into time windows: 0-29 days, 30-59 days, 60-89 days, 90-120
days and 120+ days post discharge for the COVID-19 and pneumonia cohorts, to determine
how the rate of outcomes changed over time. Rates in all three patient cohorts were stratified by
age, sex and ethnicity.
We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) to compare the rates of each outcome between, 1) the discharged COVID-19 group and
the matched general population group, and 2) the discharged COVID-19 group and the
discharged pneumonia group. We investigated crude univariable and age and sex adjusted
models. The same patient can contribute person-time to all exposure groups, however these
periods are non-overlapping therefore we applied robust standard errors.
In sensitivity analyses we tested the effect of including 1) previously omitted outcomes recorded
in the primary care record when there was a recorded outcome within 3 months before the index
date, and 2) only events recorded in hospital or as a cause of death on a death certificate.

Results
We identified 31,716 patients discharged following an admission with COVID-19 in 2020 and
89,185 patients discharged with pneumonia in 2019. For each patient discharged following an
admission with COVID-19 we matched up to five patients from the general population eligible in
TPP on 1st February 2019 on age, sex and region. We successfully matched five patients for
over 99.9% of COVID-19 patients.
Demographics for the cohorts studied are summarised in Table 1. Compared to the COVID-19
cohort, the pneumonia cohort had a higher proportion aged over 80. The ethnic breakdown was
broadly similar between the three groups, although COVID-19 patients had a higher proportion
of patients who were Asian and Asian British.
Overall rates of each outcome per 10,000 person months for the whole follow-up are presented
in Table 2. For the majority of outcomes we observed higher rates of serious cardiometabolic
and pulmonary complications in discharged pneumonia patients compared to both discharged
COVID-19 patients and the matched general population group (Table 2, Figure 1). Across all
three cohorts, the largest absolute rates were for AKI and heart failure. Overall rates stratified by
age, sex and ethnicity are presented in the appendix (Tables A5-A12). For COVID-19 patients,
rates of stroke and T2DM were consistently higher amongst the over 80 compared to the other
comparison groups, although the pattern was not consistent across other ages groups. Similarly,
rates were not constant by ethnic group, for example, the rate of new T2DM diagnoses were
slightly higher amongst black patients discharged following an admission with COVID-19.
Stratified overall rates in 30-day time windows are shown in Figure 1. For discharged COVID-19
patients, we observed the highest rates for all outcomes in the first 30 days post-discharge, with
a gradual decline in subsequent periods, consistent with the pattern of rates observed for
patients discharged with pneumonia in 2019. For the discharged COVID-19 and pneumonia
groups, we observed pronounced rates of AKI and heart failure in the first 30 days
post-discharge (Figure 1).
After age and sex adjustment, the discharged COVID-19 group had markedly increased risk for
all outcomes compared to the matched general population group (Table 3, Figure 2). The largest
increase in risk was observed for PE (HR 12.86; 95% CI: 11.23 - 14.74) and AKI (HR 6.72; 95%
CI: 6.35 - 7.12). For the comparison with discharged pneumonia patients, discharged COVID-19
patients had similar risks for the majority of outcomes. We observed an increased risk of new
T2DM in patients discharged with COVID-19 compared to patients discharged with pneumonia
(HR 1.23; 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.44).
Results from a sensitivity analysis investigating robustness of absolute and relative rates to
outcome definition are presented in the Appendix. Change in outcome definitions did not
meaningfully alter conclusions.

Discussion
Key findings
In this descriptive study, we set out to report the overall rates of eight cardiometabolic and
pulmonary outcomes in three cohorts: 1) patients discharged following hospitalisation with
COVID-19, 2) patients discharged following hospitalisation with pneumonia in 2019 and 3) a
frequency-matched group of patients from the general population in 2019. We found that the
rate of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications following discharge from hospitalisation
with COVID-19 was notably higher compared to an age, sex and region matched general
population cohort, especially for PE and AKI. However patients discharged with COVID-19
followed a broadly similar pattern of elevated rates to those discharged from hospital after
pneumonia in 2019. The pattern of change in the rate of outcomes over time following discharge
from hospital was also broadly similar between the COVID-19 and pneumonia patients, with the
highest rate in the initial 30 days of follow-up, then a 2-3 fold drop in the next 30 days, followed
by a more gradual decline. In both discharge based cohorts, rates remained substantial even
after more than 120 days.

Strengths and limitations
We were able to source our cohorts from the OpenSAFELY platform, which contains data on
over 17m adults. This gave us a population who were discharged following hospitalisation with
COVID-19 of 31,716, allowing us to obtain precise estimates of the rate of each outcome. We
were also able to draw on multiple linked data sources, including primary care records,
hospitalisations and death certificates. This allows a more complete picture to be presented of
the clinical activity surrounding each outcome.
We believe that our use of both a general population and active control population of patients
hospitalised with pneumonia in 2019 provides useful context for the rates of these outcomes in
COVID-19 patients who survive hospitalisation. Presenting the rates in this context is more
informative than within a general population alone and offers an important comparison with a
cohort experiencing exposure to another acute respiratory illness event requiring hospitalisation.
Our study aimed to describe clinical events that occurred after discharge from hospital, and not
the total additional morbidity burden of COVID-19 hospitalisation: specifically we did not set out
to describe events that occurred during hospital admission with COVID-19 or pneumonia.
However, in our view reliable analysis of in-hospital events may only be achievable with
bespoke collections of detailed hospital data, due to shortcomings in routinely collected
administrative data that are widely used for such analyses. For example, SUS and HES data
contain a list of diagnostic codes associated with each hospitalisation, but they do not contain
sufficient information to determine the exact timing of all events within each hospitalisation
episode. This means that time-to event analyses are not possible. Similarly it is not possible to
reliably determine the sequence of events during hospitalisation: so a patient hospitalised with
COVID-19, who later had a stroke, may be coded in a similar way to a patient who was
hospitalised with a stroke, and then infected with SARS-CoV-2 while in hospital. In addition,
routine PCR testing on hospitalised patients during the pandemic may lead to very high

ascertainment of infection with SARS-CoV-2, which may not have occurred to the same extent
in the comparison population for pneumonia admissions.
We did not attempt to determine here whether any observed differences were due to a particular
feature of the pathophysiology associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or whether other factors
might have had a greater influence, such as competing risk of death, pre-existing patient
comorbidities, changes in healthcare provision during the pandemic or differing likelihood of
ascertainment of pre-existing conditions. In the context of the rapidly changing pandemic, we
aimed to provide an overview of the rates of outcomes after discharge from hospitalisation with
COVID-19, compared with pneumonia, to inform health services.
It has been reported that there was a marked reduction in GP and hospital activity during the
first wave of the pandemic, for example a 40% reduction in admissions for acute coronary
syndrome.10–12 This may be in part explained by a reluctance of patients to present at healthcare
services for fear of contracting the virus. As a result, we believe population-level rates of many
outcomes will be under-ascertained during 2020 compared with 2019. It is unknown whether
this applies in the same way to patients who have already had severe COVID-19; if
ascertainment is lower, then this would result in a possible under-estimate of outcome rates
associated with COVID-19 in our study.

Research in context
A recent observational study measured similar outcome events in a population of patients
discharged from hospital following COVID-19.13 They observed elevated rates in the COVID-19
population compared to a matched general population control group. Our findings are consistent
in showing similarly increased rates of outcomes in patients post-discharge with COVID-19.
However, importantly we further show that these increased rates of outcomes are broadly
comparable, if not slightly lower, when compared to people discharged from hospital following
pneumonia, selected as a major non-COVID respiratory infection.
The impact of the post COVID-19 hospitalisation events described in this study upon the NHS in
England is substantial. Future work should also investigate any association between
non-hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 infection and these outcomes, and quantify any likely population
level impact.

Summary
The rate of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events in COVID-19 survivors discharged from
hospitalisation was elevated in a similar manner to patients discharged from hospitalisation with
pre-pandemic pneumonia. Next steps include seeing whether patients at highest risk of
post-covid outcomes can be identified and determining whether higher risk groups could be
early targeted for possible preventative action.

Data Sharing
All data were linked, stored and analysed securely within the OpenSAFELY platform
(https://opensafely.org/). Detailed pseudonymized patient data are potentially re-identifiable and
therefore not shared. We rapidly delivered the OpenSAFELY data analysis platform without prior
funding to deliver timely analyses of urgent research questions in the context of the global
COVID-19 health emergency: now that the platform is established, we are developing a formal
process for external users to request access in collaboration with NHS England. Details of this
process will be published in due course on the OpenSAFELY website.

Information governance and ethics
NHS England is the data controller; TPP is the data processor; and the key researchers on
OpenSAFELY are acting on behalf of NHS England. OpenSAFELY is hosted within the TPP
environment which is accredited to the ISO 27001 information security standard and is NHS IG
Toolkit compliant;14,15 patient data are pseudonymised for analysis and linkage using industry
standard cryptographic hashing techniques; all pseudonymised datasets transmitted for linkage
onto OpenSAFELY are encrypted; access to the platform is via a virtual private network (VPN)
connection, restricted to a small group of researchers who hold contracts with NHS England and
only access the platform to initiate database queries and statistical models. Pseudonymised
structured data include demographics, medications prescribed from primary care, diagnoses,
and laboratory measures. No free text data are included. All database activity is logged; only
aggregate statistical outputs leave the platform environment following best practice for
anonymisation of results such as statistical disclosure control for low cell counts.16 The
OpenSAFELY research platform adheres to the obligations of the UK General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018. In March 2020, the Secretary of State for
Health and Social Care used powers under the UK Health Service (Control of Patient
Information) Regulations 2002 (COPI) to require organisations to process confidential patient
information for the purposes of protecting public health, providing healthcare services to the
public and monitoring and managing the COVID-19 outbreak and incidents of exposure; this
sets aside the requirement for patient consent.17 Taken together, these provide the legal bases
to link patient datasets on the OpenSAFELY platform. GP practices, from which the primary care
data are obtained, are required to share relevant health information to support the public health
response to the pandemic, and have been informed of the OpenSAFELY analytics platform.
This study was approved by the Health Research Authority (REC reference 20/LO/0651) and by
the LSHTM Ethics Board (ref 21863).
