To the Editor:

24

The use of antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 has increased

25

within the last months and has an important role in pandemic management. However, broader

26

use and scale up is limited due to complex sampling methods. In 2020, the World Health

27

Organization (WHO) recommended two lateral flow Ag-RDTs ((SD Biosensor, Inc.

28

Gyeonggi-do, Korea, distributed by Roche, Germany, henceforth called Standard Q; and

29

Abbott Panbio™ (Rapid Diagnostics, Jena, Germany; henceforth called PanBio)), both

30

initially with nasopharyngeal (NP) sample collection [1,2]. Since then, independent head-to-

31

head studies demonstrated that nasal sampling (including self-sampling) assessed against NP

32

sampling leads to comparable performance using the SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT SD STANDARD

33

Q [3-5]. For Panbio, only one study to date assessed professional nasal mid-turbinate (NMT)

34

sampling and showed 82.1% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity in comparison to reverse

35

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, a head-to-head comparison with

36

NP sampling has not been performed to date [6].

37

We conducted a manufacturer-independent prospective study directly comparing the

38

diagnostic accuracy of Panbio performed with a supervised, self-collected NMT swab versus

39

a professionally collected NP swab. For the two Ag-RDT sampling techniques positive and

40

negative percent agreements (PPA, NPA) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity were

41

assessed and compared against the reference standard RT-PCR.

42

The ethical review committee at Heidelberg University Hospital approved the study protocol

43

(registration number S-180/2020). Enrollment and testing took place in Heidelberg

44

(Germany) between December 15ths 2020 and January 19ths 2021 in a SARS-CoV-2 drive-in

45

testing centre, led by the local health authority. We included adults with symptoms suggestive

46

for a SARS-CoV-2 infection or a recent high-risk contact with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case.

47

After written informed consent, each participant was instructed to self-collect a NMT swab

48

for the Ag-RDT under supervision using a non-flocked swab (Jiangsu Changfeng Medical

49

Industry Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China), provided by Abbott in the research use only Panbio kit for

50

nasal swab testing. The instructions were verbal and picture-guided following the

51

manufacturer’s instructions for use. In a second step, a health worker collected a NP swab

52

(using IMPROSWAB®, Guangzhou Improve Medical Instruments Co., Ltd., Guangzhou,

53

China), for RT-PCR testing in one nostril. Finally, a second NP swab for Ag-RDT testing was

54

collected from the patient using a nylon-flocked specimen (NFS-SWAB Applicator™, Noble

55

Bioscienes

56

(nasopharyngeal) test kit. The PanBio was conducted on-site by trained study personnel

57

following the manufacturer’s instruction for use for each kit [7]. Two study staff read out the

58

Ag-RDT results, each of them blinded to the interpretation of the other.

59

For RT-PCR testing the Tib Molbiol® (Berlin, Germany) assay was used. Viral load (VL)

60

values were calculated based on a calibration curve and the assay specific cycle threshold

61

(Ct)-value [8]. Leftover samples of the NMT and NP swabs resuspended in Ag-RDT buffer

62

were stored at -20 degrees Celsius. Samples that were identified to be false-positive in

63

comparison to RT-PCR on one or both Ag-RDTs were retested with RT-PCR from the

64

remnant Ag-RDT buffer.

65

We screened a total of 369 eligible individuals of whom 292 (79.1%) gave written consent.

66

After exclusion of two participants (one with invalid RT-PCR result and one with lost written

67

informed consent), 290 participants were included in the analysis (study flow detailed in

68

Supplementary Material (B)). Our study population had an average age of 42.7 years

69

(standard deviation (SD) 14.6), 33.8% (98/290) had comorbidities and 52.4% (152/290) were

70

female. In total, 45.9% (133/290) were symptomatic on the day of testing with a mean

71

duration of symptoms of 3.8 days (SD 5.4). SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected by RT-PCR

72

in 15.5% (45/290) of the study population (Table 1), with eight infections being among

73

asymptomatic participants. One invalid Ag-RDT was registered on NP samples, which was

74

valid upon repeat.

75

The overall sensitivity of Panbio with NP sampling was 88.9% (40/45; 95% confidence

76

interval (CI) 76.5% - 95.5%) and 84.4% (38/45; CI 71.2% - 92.3%) with NMT sampling.

77

Four infections were identified by NP Ag-RDT sampling, which were negative in NMT

78

sampling of which two had a low VL (VL <4.9 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml) and two

79

were asymptomatic (Table 1). Two participants had a positive NMT result, not detected via

80

NP Ag-RDT, of which one had a low VL (VL <4.9 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml).

81

Specificity was 99.2% (243/245; CI 97.1% - 99.8%) for both, NP and NMT sampling.

82

Considering only RT-PCR positive participants with high VL (> 7 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA

83

copies/mL), the sensitivity of the Panbio test was 96.3% (CI 81.7% - 99.8%) for both NMT

84

and NP sampling. Excluding nine participants with oropharyngeal sampling instead of NP

85

(due to contraindications of NP sampling) increased sensitivity only marginally (40/44; 90.9%

86

(CI 78.8% – 96.4%)). Detailed results by symptoms and sub-group analyses are available in

87

the Supplement (C&D). The positive percent agreement of the Ag-RDT was 88.1% (37/42

88

PCR positives detected; CI 75.0% - 94.8%) including one false-positive by both NMT and

89

NP, and one false-positive by NP only. The negative percent agreement was 98.8% (245/248;

90

CI 96.5% - 99.6%). Inter-rater reliability for the interpretation of the Ag-RDTs was perfect

91

with a kappa of 1.0. Participants reported NMT sampling to be better tolerated than NP

92

sampling.

93

When performing RT-PCR from the remnant buffer/sample-mixture, SARS CoV-2 was

94

identified in both NMT and NP samples from the same participant with a false-positive Ag-

95

RDT result. This suggests the Ag-RDT result being in fact true-positive with a sampling error

96

likely having occurred for the RT-PCR from NP sample. For two other false-positives, one

97

each on NMT and NP, no virus was identified in the buffer solution. Among three false-

98

negative NMT samples one buffer was positive with low VL (4.38 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA

99

copies/ml; Supplementary Material (F), suggesting that the VL was below the limit of

100

detection of the Ag-RDT.

101

Our study has several strengths. Study methods were rigorous and included standardized

102

sampling and two independent blinded readers. The study population is representative,

103

judging from the similar sensitivity of the Panbio test with NP sampling observed in our study

104

in comparison to two large validation studies [9,10]. All samples for routine RT-PCR were

105

tested via the same RT-PCR assay (Table 1). The RT-PCR on the leftover buffer solution of

106

Ag-RDT allowed us to perform further discrepant analysis.

107

A limitation of the study is that it was performed in a single centre. The preselection of

108

participants invited to come for testing was done according to national guidelines. We did not

109

record deviations from the recommended NMT procedure, however as the sampling was done

110

under proactive supervision, no major deviations were observed. Readers were not blinded to

111

the sampling method while interpreting the test results, but weak positive results are rarely

112

observed with the Panbio test, thus this limitation is unlikely to result in a difference in result

113

interpretation. In the discrepant analysis, we did not perform RT-PCR of all Ag-RDT buffer

114

solutions thus introducing a possible bias.

115

Our study suggests that supervised NMT self-sampling leads to results comparable to NP

116

sampling for the PanBio Ag-RDT. A possible reduction in VL present in the nasal region

117

compared to the nasopharyngeal region may be counterbalanced by the ease-of-sampling.

118

Results of nasal sampling could potentially be further improved, if flocked swabs were used

119

[11]. Standardized easy self-sampling methods are highly desirable, as they could increase
