Abstract:
Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are the most susceptible group to get COVID-19 infection
and this group always need special attention as they are the key human resource to contain this
pandemic.
Objective: To track down the seroprevalence among a particular group of HCWs working in the
anaesthesia department in hospital settings.
Study design: Two rounds of serosurvey were done to track the dynamicity among the 128 and 164
HCWs participants in the first round and second round, respectively. 5 mL of blood was collected
and IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody was tested in Abbott Architect i1000SR.
Results: The seroprevalence found in the first and second round was 12.5% and 38.4%, respectively.
A significant number (n=61, 77.21%) of seropositivity came from the asymptomatic HCWs group as
found in both the survey. There was no significant association among different age, gender and RTPCR tested groups.
Conclusion: Routine diagnosis of COVID-19 should be referred among HCWs to identify and act upon
unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The first incidence of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was found in December 2019 from Wuhan
city of China (1). Since then, the cumulative new cases are being reported from each part of the
world which forced the world health organization (WHO) to declare the disease as a pandemic in
March 2020 (2). A total number of 81.5 million confirmed cases has been registered and the global
death count reached 1.8 million by the end of 2020. India, the second largest populated country has
seen a positive case above 10 million and mortality of 100,000 in a single year (3). The clinical
manifestation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection mainly
varied from very mild to severe pneumonia, respiratory distress and death. However, as most of the
patients develop no symptoms, the exact number of positive cases should be far more than the
registered data (4).
Health care workers (HCWs) from anaesthesia departments of a hospital are one of the most
vulnerable groups in the transmission of COVID-19 through patients, colleagues or from the
community. Although real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal swab sample
is the current gold standard for the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, screening of symptoms
for HWCs and then go for RT-PCR is a standard practice to control infection (5, 6). However, the high
proportion of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases often neglect the potential disease
transmitter which aggravates the infection among patients and other HCWs (7). The current study
was to determine the utility of a regular serological survey for the screening of asymptomatic
infected individual among HCWs related to patient’s anaesthesia in hospital settings.
Methods:
Study settings
A total of 128 HCWs participated in the first serological survey in September 2020 and 164 HCWs in
the second survey conducted in December 2020 from 12 hospitals in Bhubaneswar, India. All the
participants were working in the anaesthesia department and responsible to deliver care and
services to critical patients, either directly as physicians or nurses, or indirectly as technicians,
administrative staffs or other support staffs. Only the willing participants were included in this study
and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Clinical and other demographic
data was collected during sample collection. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Human Ethics Committee of the Indian Council of Medical Research-Regional Medical Research
Centre, Bhubaneswar.

Collection of blood
Sera samples were collected and tested to determine the presence of IgG antibodies against the
nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in an automated analyzer ARCHITECT i1000SR (Abbott
Laboratories, Chicago, USA) using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)
technology. The assay specificity in this platform was 99.63% (95% confidence of interval [CI]: 99.0599.90%) and sensitivity was 100% (95% CI: 95.89-100%) when tested after 14 days of symptom onset
as per the manufacturer. The cut-off value was 1.4 index.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistical analyses were performed by SPSS software (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,
version 24.0, Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism software version 7.0 for Windows (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, California, USA). p values < 0.05 was considered as significant.
Results
In the first round of the survey, 16 HCWs were found to have antibody which is only 12.5% of the
total participants. The seropositive number increased to 63 from a total of 164 HCWs in the second
serosurvey which is around 38.4% (Figure 1). We analyzed and correlated the antibody titre values
from all the 79 seropositive individuals against symptoms status, age groups and gender (Table 1).
A total of 35 HCWs (11.98%) developed symptoms out of 292 participants throughout two survey
phases with three HCWs requiring hospitalization. Among antibody-positive HCWs, only 18 persons
(22.78%) developed any COVID symptoms within 30 days of the survey which is statistically
significant with the asymptomatic antibody-positive group (77.22%). The mostly found symptoms
among this group were fever (83.33%) followed by cough (50%), malaise (27.7%), fatigue (27.7%),
throat pain (22.2%), loss of smell (22.2%), chest pain (16.7%). Nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal
samples from 90.63% (first survey) and 92.07% (second survey) of the HCWs had been tested in RTPCR but only 22 (8.24%) were tested positive in RT-PCR. In both the serosurvey, higher
seroprevalence was found in the male group compared to the female although it was statistically
non-significant. In this study, we categorised four different groups based on patients’ age viz. group
I (≤29 years), group II (30-45 years), group III (46-60 years) and group IV (>60 years). Contingency
chi-square test analysis couldn’t find any significant correlation among the different age groups
throughout both the survey. The highest percentage of seropositivity was found in the 45-59 years
age group in the first round (27.3%) whereas, in the second round, the maximum seropositive came

from 30-44 years (43.0%). In the first round of the survey, 116 HCWs were already tested in RT-PCR
and the second phase, the RT-PCR tested number was 151. A total of 5 and 17 HCWs were confirmed
RT-PCR positive in the first and second serosurvey, respectively. Among those 22 cases, 19
individuals (86.36%) developed antibody as found in this study (Table 1).
Discussion
Early diagnosis and understanding of immunological responses are essential to study the COVID-19
disease progression. Serological studies provide relevant information about the spread of infection
among the communities and the number of individuals who have infected in the recent past.
Conducting such studies among the health care workers regardless of the onset of the symptoms is
important to understand the level of exposure within the hospitals and this helps us to identify and
prevent the spread of infection. Similarly, the information about the recently infected HCWs could
be helpful for the hospital administration to skip the compulsory quarantine period and can be
useful for maximizing the use of an available resource or manpower (5, 8).
Seroprevalence found in both the survey among HCWs was higher than the 2nd and 3rd national
serosurvey conducted in India during August to September 2020 and December 2020 to January
2021 where the seropositivity found among the adults were 6.6% and 21.4%, respectively (9). The
total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Bhubaneswar was 10,425 at the end of August 2020
but it reached a peak of 30,751 by the end of November 2020 (10). The rapid increase in the total
confirmed cases can be easily correlated with the difference in the seroprevalence between the two
serosurveys among the HCWs. Our study also found that most of the seropositive HCWs were
asymptomatic and the ratio was 3.4:1 to the asymptomatic cases. Moreover, most of the HCWs
(n=277) were tested in RT-PCR but only 7.94% (n=22) were confirmed as positive. Seropositive
significance in chi-square test among symptomatic and asymptomatic suggests a need for routine
screening of COVID-19 is mostly needed as this group is the most vulnerable one in a hospital setting.
This study from the anaesthesia department HCWs can easily be correlated with some other findings
on overall hospital workers (11, 12).
Our study also has a few limitations. First, as our participants were from the anaesthesia department
of hospital settings, thus it may not speculate the exact association of immune response among the
whole HCW community. Second, underestimation during reporting of the symptoms might be

happened due to the immense workload of health workers which force them to neglect mild
symptoms and timely diagnosis.
In conclusion, health workers are the most susceptible group to get COVID infection. Conditions like
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic make the scenario complicated due to the non-occurrence of
routine diagnosis. Although our study has few limitations, there is no such study with health workers
only from the anaesthesia department of hospital settings to demonstrate the seroprevalence and
its association with symptoms, RT-PCR test, age and gender to our best knowledge. Our result
concludes that HCWs should routinely get tested for COVID-19 as most of them may be
asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic which indeed a much more concerning situation when it comes
to patients’ safety.
