ABSTRACT

27
28

Objectives: To investigate the COVID-19 infections among staff at our institution and

29

determine the interventions required to prevent subsequent staff infections.

30

Design: Retrospective cohort study

31

Participants and setting: Staff working at a single tertiary referral hospital who returned a

32

positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020.

33

Main outcome measures: Source of COVID-19 infection.

34

Results: Of 45 staff who returned a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 19 were determined

35

to be acquired at Austin Health. Fifteen (15/19; 79% [95% CI: 54–94%]) of these were

36

identified through contact tracing and testing following exposures to other infected staff and

37

were presumed to be staff-staff transmission, including 10 healthcare workers (HCWs) linked

38

to a single ward that cared for COVID-19 patients. Investigation of the outbreak identified

39

the staff tearoom as the likely location for transmission, with subsequent reduction in HCW

40

infections and resolution of the outbreak following implementation of enhanced control

41

measures in tearoom facilities. No HCW contacts (0/204; 0% [95% CI: 0–2%]) developed

42

COVID-19 infection following exposure to unrecognised patients with COVID-19.

43

Conclusions: Unrecognised infections among staff may be a significant driver of HCW

44

infections in healthcare settings. Control measures should be implemented to prevent

45

acquisition from other staff as well as patient-staff transmission.

INTRODUCTION

47
48

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced significant challenges to

49

the safe provision of healthcare. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are essential for the care of

50

patients infected with COVID-19 and thereby place themselves at risk of acquiring COVID-

51

19.1 In a recent report of HCW COVID-19 infections in Victoria, Australia, the state

52

Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) reported that 72.9% of COVID-19

53

infections in HCWs were acquired in a healthcare setting.2 High rates of HCW infections

54

have been attributed to several factors, including inadequate personal protective equipment

55

(PPE), exposure to large numbers or a high density of COVID-19 infected patients, poor

56

ventilation, worker fatigue and limited access to diagnostic tests.3-8 At our hospital, we

57

observed an increase in HCW COVID-19 infections over a two-week period in July and

58

August 2020 which predominantly involved staff working on a single ward. Here, we

59

describe the staff infections at our institution and the interventions introduced to prevent

60

subsequent transmission.

METHODS

63

Setting

64

Austin Health is a tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia that operates >900 beds and includes

65

state-wide transplantation and clinical specialty services. During the pandemic, several wards

66

were repurposed as dedicated areas to cohort patients with COVID-19 and were designated

67

“COVID wards”. Maximum patient occupancy for COVID wards was reduced from standard

68

capacity to minimise density quotients for shared rooms, while maintaining sufficient staffing

69

to accommodate the increased time requirements for changes of PPE and additional cleaning.

70

Use of PPE was in accordance with state (DHHS) guidelines9, 10 and included a “PPE spotter”

71

on COVID wards. Routine cleaning of COVID wards was performed in line with national

72

guidance11 and included daily cleaning and disinfection using Chloradet™ (Agar Cleaning

73

Systems, Preston, Australia) with additional cleaning of frequently touched surfaces. All

74

staff, visitors and patients were screened for symptoms of COVID-19 upon entry. Staff who

75

returned a positive test to SARS-CoV-2 were required to immediately notify the Infection

76

Prevention and Control team, the Occupational Health and Safety team, and their local

77

manager. Samples were taken according to state and national guidelines12, 13 using a

78

combined throat and deep nasal swab. Positive test samples or an aliquot of extracted nucleic

79

acid from positive samples were sent to the public health laboratory for genomic testing and

80

analysis using methods previously reported.14

81
82

Data Collection

83

All Austin Health staff who were notified to the organisation after returning a positive test by

84

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of symptoms, were

85

included in the analysis. Data from contact tracing interviews conducted at the time were

86

included in the study with additional details sought retrospectively.

87
88

Definitions

89

HCWs were defined as staff who had a clinical role in directly caring for patients i.e. those

90

who had physical contact or were in close proximity (<1.5 metres) to patients. Cases were

91

attributed to a particular source based on the criteria outlined in Supplementary Table 1.

92

Contact definitions were taken from DHHS guidelines available at the time12 and adapted for

93

local implementation to account for the routine use of PPE by staff (Supplementary Figure 1).

94

All staff who had unprotected exposure to confirmed cases of COVID-19 were required to be

tested for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline and day 11 after last exposure to an infected individual,

96

with additional testing performed if they became symptomatic.

97
98

Statistics

99

Statistical analysis was conducted in RStudio (R version 4.0.3). Confidence intervals for

100

sample proportions were calculated by exact binomial distribution. Incidence rates of HCW

101

infection for a specified group (e.g. ward or HCW type) were standardised to cases per 100

102

patient exposure days, where the number of patient exposure days was calculated by:

110

RESULTS

111

Between 25 January 2020 and 25 November 2020, a total of 49 staff recorded a positive PCR

112

result for SARS-CoV-2 among 8327 staff working at Austin Health (Figure 1). Of these, four

113

staff were excluded from the analyses after an initial indeterminate result and negative results

114

on subsequent testing. There were 45 staff infections included in the analysis, with 28/45

115

(62% [95% CI 47–76%]) presumed to be healthcare acquired (19 Austin Health; 9 other) on

116

the basis of the source attribution (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Of the 19 infections

117

likely to have been acquired at Austin Health, 10/19 (53%) involved staff working on a

118

dedicated COVID ward (“Ward A”), clustered in time around early August 2020 (Figure 2).

120

Outbreak among staff working on a dedicated COVID ward

121

Ward A is a 32-bed general hospital ward repurposed in March 2020 to provide care to

122

patients with confirmed COVID-19, including eight single occupancy rooms, and capacity

123

reduced from 4 to 1–2 patients per room in six shared patient rooms. The ward’s Heating,

124

Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system was modified to supply 100% fresh air

125

intake and exhaust return air from the ward outside the building to avoid recirculation. Air

126

flow was adjusted to achieve a net negative pressure differential of 3-4 Pa to establish inward

127

air movement to the ward from adjoining corridors. At the time of the detection of the first

128

staff case on Ward A, the PPE worn by staff entering Ward A included P2/N95 respirators (a

129

change made prior to the formal updates in state and national guidelines in response to

130

increasing HCW cases at other healthcare institutions and aligned with the decisions at those

131

institutions at the time1, 9), face shield, isolation gown, and gloves. Most nursing and cleaning

132

staff worked exclusively on Ward A and were experienced in caring for patients infected with

133

COVID. Ward A shared the same PPE donning room and staff bathroom with another

134

adjacent COVID ward (Ward B), but had separate doffing areas (located immediately prior to

135

exiting each ward) and dedicated staff tearooms outside the clinical areas.

136
137

The first case identified on Ward A returned a positive PCR test to SARS-CoV-2 in late July

138

2020 after developing mild respiratory symptoms (Figure 3 and Table 1). Testing of contacts

139

identified Case 2, who had tested negative on two occasions in the previous week after

140

exposure to a positive HCW on another ward in mid July. Case 2 acknowledged having

141

respiratory symptoms when interviewed with an interpreter, and had worked six shifts during

142

the infectious period. All staff who had worked on Ward A during the infectious period were

143

tested upon detection of Case 2, and again at day 7 and 11 after last exposure on the ward.

144

Additional upstream source contacts were also identified and tested. Due to the likelihood of

145

secondary and possibly tertiary transmissions, all staff that worked the same, preceding or

146

following shifts on Ward A as either Case 1 or Case 2 during the infectious period were

147

furloughed. The case load of Ward A was reduced to 8 patients to accommodate for

148

decreased staffing.

149
150

In total, 179 HCW contacts exposed to Cases 1 and 2 were interviewed as part of the

151

outbreak investigation, identifying 11 close contacts, 82 moderate contacts and 86 casual

152

contacts. 95 HCW contacts had worked on Ward A during the infectious period and provided

153

care to patients with COVID-19. Of these, close and moderate contacts predominantly

154

comprised staff who recalled sharing the Ward A staff tearoom with Case 2. 45/95 (47%) of

155

the Ward A HCW contacts did not use the staff tearoom at the same time as Case 2, and

156

included medical and allied health staff who worked the same hours on Ward A but who used

157

different break facilities, and night-shift nursing staff who did not work the same or

158

overlapping shift hours. None of these staff returned a positive test. Of the other 50 Ward A

159

HCW contacts, seven returned a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (7/50; 14% [95% CI: 6–27%];

160

vs 0/45, p = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test). The incidence of positive HCWs on Ward A was 1.2

161

per 100 patient days of exposure compared to 0.7 per 100 patient days of exposure among

162

HCWs on other COVID wards (incidence rate ratio = 1.76; [95% CI 0.64–4.84]). Genomic

163

analysis indicated all cases were derived from the same D.2 lineage (formerly B.1.1.25), as

164

were the majority of cases in Victoria at the time.15

165
166

Case 8 returned a positive result during the same period, but worked on a different ward and

167

was not initially linked through contact tracing. Although this HCW had cared for patients

168

with suspected COVID-19, the HCW did not have any contact with patients with confirmed

169

COVID-19. However, the HCW reported having meal breaks in the Ward A tearoom during

170

the exposure period with colleagues who worked on Ward A, and was subsequently linked to

171

the Ward A outbreak.

172
173

In response to the outbreak, staff break room policies were revised to apply stricter controls

174

to mitigate the potential risk of transmission (Table 2). Following the return to work of

175

HCWs after furlough, ward occupancy was increased again to capacity with patients with

176

COVID-19. One additional HCW (Case 10) returned a positive test 14 days after the last

177

positive case, but did not have any contact with any of the other Ward A staff cases during

178

their respective infectious periods. Routine testing of HCWs working on COVID wards was

179

introduced in early September in line with DHHS recommendations. The outbreak was

180

considered resolved in late September, 28 days (two incubation periods) after the last staff

181

member tested positive.

182
183

Other staff cases

184

Of the other nine staff cases presumed to be acquired at our institution, eight were HCWs.

185

The non-clinical staff member likely acquired COVID-19 when using the same office as a

186

HCW who had returned to work after completing a secondment assisting with the outbreak

187

response at a residential aged care facility. This HCW, who presumably acquired COVID-19

188

while on secondment, had used the office for non-clinical duties two days prior to developing

189

symptoms, and had vacated the office immediately prior to handing over to the non-clinical

190

staff member.

191
192

In addition to the last HCW case on Ward A, three other HCW cases did not have an

193

identified link and were presumed to be independent acquisitions from infected patients

194

(4/19; 21% [95% CI: 6–46%]), including one who reported a clear PPE breach. The

195

remaining five HCW cases outside of Ward A were identified from testing of contacts after

196

investigation of staff cases, and were presumably linked to these other staff.

197
198

Staff exposures to undiagnosed patients

199

From 25 January 2020 (first case identified in Victoria) until 24 November 2020 (last active

200

case in Victoria deemed non-infectious), 204 HCWs were identified as contacts of patients

201

who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 due to exposure during the infectious period, prior

202

to diagnosis and implementation of appropriate precautions (median exposure = 1 day; range

203

1–6 days; total 223 patient exposure days). Of these 70 close, 25 moderate, and 109 casual

204

contacts, none (0/204; 0% [95% CI 0–2%]) developed COVID-19 infection from their

205

exposure.

206
207

DISCUSSION

208

HCW have been disproportionately affected in the number of detected cases in Australia,

209

particularly in Victoria,2, 16 though the exact mechanisms for acquisition of infection remain

210

difficult to prove. While the majority of HCW infections are presumed to be acquired at work

211

while undertaking clinical activities, several aspects of our data suggest that these are not

212

necessarily all derived from exposure to infected patients, but may also be driven by exposure

213

to other infected staff working in the healthcare setting. Firstly, the incidence of infected

214

HCWs was clustered both in time and in geographic location. Of the 19 HCWs who possibly

215

or probably acquired infection at our institution, half of these were linked to a single ward.

216

Although this ward cared for patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, the rate of HCW

217

infections was greater than on other wards that also cared for patients with COVID-19, when

218

standardised for exposure to patients with COVID-19. Nine of the 10 HCW infections linked

219

to the ward occurred within a 2-week period (i.e. a 5% time window of the 9 months that

9

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.25.20248824; this version posted December 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

220

HCWs working on this ward had been caring for patients with COVID-19). Secondly, the

221

involvement of Case 8 in the cluster, who had no contact with patients infected with COVID-

222

19, but who used the Ward A staff tearoom, points towards transmission in this space. In

223

contrast, staff working on Ward A who did not use the tearoom did not test positive in the

224

outbreak investigation. Thirdly, the incidence of HCW infections significantly reduced after

225

changes were made to the protocols around use of staff tearooms, without any change in PPE,

226

ventilation or patient occupancy of the COVID ward.

227
228

In Australia, there has been considerable attention focussed on measures to prevent

229

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected patients to staff.17, 18 However, as others have

230

also identified internationally, transmission between staff in non-clinical areas can also be a

231

significant driver of HCW infections.19, 20 Measures to prevent transmission between staff are

232

critical, given that infected individuals may be infectious despite being asymptomatic or pre-

233

symptomatic,21 and staff are generally less suspicious of other staff working regularly in

234

close proximity to them than patients or members of the public. The presence of undetected

235

COVID-19 infection in HCWs was highlighted in a large seroprevalence survey of HCWs

236

who routinely cared for COVID-19 patients, where 6% had serological evidence of previous

237

infection, of whom 29% were asymptomatic in the preceding months and 69% had not

238

previously received a diagnosis.22

239
240

There are limitations to our retrospective observational data, with only a small number of

241

HCW infections at a single healthcare institution to draw inferences from that may not be

242

representative of the transmission occurring in other facilities. However, our experience

243

provides important local data in recognising the potential for transmission between staff, as

244

has occurred in other essential non-healthcare industries such as food production and

10

245

distribution. Staff tearooms or break rooms pose a particular challenge. In an environment

246

where transmission is unable to be mitigated by PPE, staff are vulnerable to acquisition from

247

other infected staff. In a study of 703 infected HCWs at a single institution, staying in the

248

same break room as a HCW without a mask for >15 minutes and consuming food within 1 m

249

of another HCW were identified as risk factors for infection.20 However, tearoom and break

250

facilities are essential to the wellbeing of HCWs, and provide an area to rest and replenish –

251

critical resources to reducing staff fatigue that can also contribute to HCW infections through

252

errors and breaches in otherwise routine practices such as hand hygiene and doffing of PPE.7,

253

8

254

restricting use of these facilities.

Space is often limited in HCW tearooms, with physical distancing requirements further

255
256

A greater understanding of HCW infections is essential to minimising the risk to frontline

257

staff caring for patients with COVID-19. As our data indicate, healthcare institutions must

258

consider risks to staff in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and ensure appropriate

259

measures are in place to mitigate these risks.

•

Limited time in tearoom to 15 minutes for consumption of food/drink
and encouraged remainder of break to be spent elsewhere while
wearing a face mask

•

Reinforced designation of break rooms to specific wards, with mixing
of staff working across different clinical areas discouraged

•

Removed excess furniture and placed markings/signs to reinforce
physical distancing

•

Signs placed on break room doors to indicate maximum occupancy

•

Improved record keeping and auditing of break room use to monitor
adherence to organisation policy

B. Staff-staff linkages among staff diagnosed with COVID-19. HCWs involved in the Ward
A outbreak are shown in black and numbered, with Case 2 presumed to be the primary case.
Linkages are coloured based on contact assignment through contact tracing following each
exposure. Case 10 was identified while the Ward A outbreak was still considered “active”,
but was not thought to be linked to the other staff. Two additional HCWs (shown in grey)
who also worked in aged care facilities with active outbreaks have been included as the initial
presumed source for subsequent staff infections.
