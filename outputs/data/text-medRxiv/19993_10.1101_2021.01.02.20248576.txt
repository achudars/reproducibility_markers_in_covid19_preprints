ABSTRACT
Background
Self-medication has become is a serious public health problem globally posing great risks,
especially with the increasing number of cases of COVID-19 disease in Uganda. This is may be
partly because of the absence of a recognized treatment for the disease, however, the prevalence
and nature differ from country to country which may influence human behavioural responses.
Aim
This study aimed to investigated the beharioural response of the community towards selfmedication practices during this COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.
Methods
A cross sectional household and online survey was conducted during the months of June-toAugust. The study was conducted among adult between age 18 above in communities of western
Uganda who consented to participate in the study. Study participants were selected using a
convenience sampling technique and sampling was done by sending a structured online
questionnaire via Google forms and a printed copies questionnaire made available to other
participants that did not use the online questionnaire
Results
The percentage of respondents that know about self-medication is (97%) and those that practice
self-medication are approximately (88%). 97% of respondents have heard about self-medication
either through health workers, media, family members, friends and/or school while 3% said they
have not heard about self-medication. The percentage of respondents who practiced selfmedication during COVID-19 pandemic is 57% while those that did not is 43%. There is
statistically difference in the number of those that practice self-medication and those that do not
p < 0.005 at 95% confidence interval. Also there was a statistically significant decrease in the
number of respondents that practice self-medication during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown
compare to the practice before the pandemic lockdown p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval.
Conclusion
Our investigation showed adequate knowledge of self-medication and high level of selfmedication practice with a decrease in self-medication practices during the COVID-19 pandemic
lockdown compared to the practice before the lockdown.

INTRODUCTION
The outbreak of coronavirus have prompted many countries around the world including Uganda
to introduce lockdown as advised by WHO because of growing cases. In most countries so far,
partial lockdowns as well as social distancing guidelines, frequent washing of hands and/or
sanitizing have been put in place to curb the spread of the virus. Some of these restrictions may
remain in place probably until a vaccine for the virus has been developed. In this regards many
human behavioural patterns to life have been seriously affected raging from education, economic,
health, social, religion etc.
In Uganda for example, total ban on people’s movement from one district to another, border
closure, curfew and others are measures that have been employed to prevent the spread of the
virus, however, many patients suffering from other diseases have little or no access to health care
service as a result of restrictions especially on movement. Some studies have revealed significant
changes in the way people live their lives during this lockdown which included avoiding crowded
public places, wearing a face mask, avoiding physical contact, improving personal hygiene (e.g.
frequent washing of hands and using hand sanitizer), changes in sleep and use of sleep substances,
diet and physical activities (Bruine de Bruin & Bennett, 2020, Arora & Grey, 2020 and WHO,
2018). Some of these may have some behaviours and mental health implications
In the period of this pandemic, the way individual behaves is important to note because a change
in the public behavior is an alternative to controlling outbreaks when there is no suitable
pharmacological interventions. Furthermore, the behavioural patterns of an individual can
influence their family, communities, society and social networks (Chen et al., 2017). Epidermics
had been reported in a study which used mathematical models to affect people’s fears, emotions
and ultimately their behavior (Bi et al., 2019). With respect to these behavioural changes resulting
from the lockdown and restrictions, we envisaged that self-medication practices may be
influenced by the way people try to cope with their health management at this crucial time.
Self-medication can be referred to as the intake of drugs, herbs or home remedies either on one’s
own initiative, or on the advice of another person for physical or psychological ailments
(Hernandez‑Juyol and Job‑Quesada, 2002). Common sources of self-medications include
previous prescribed drug, pharmacist, family, friends, neighbours, internet, and suggestions from
an advertisement etc. According to Osemene and Lamikanra, (2012), self-medication is a serious
public health problem globally posing risks such as drug resistance, organ damage and deaths
(2.9 – 3.7%) in the world because of drug-drug interaction.
The probability of drug abuse has been reported to be on the rise as a result of global increase in
self-medication (McCabe et al., 2005, WHO 1998). Signs and symptoms of underlying disease
conditions can be concealed by self-medication, therefore causing drug resistance, delay
diagnoses and making the problem complex or difficult to deal with (Bauchner and Wise 2000,
Calabresi and Cupini, 2005).
Although, several countries and cultures presents the nature and prevalence of self-medication
differently globally, nevertheless the practices are mostly based on certain advantage or
disadvantage obtained from past experiences with similar drugs (McCabe et al., 2005). The effects
of self-medication can be positive when practiced correctly; such as saving scarce medical
resources from being wasted on minor conditions, reducing the pressure on medical services
where health care personnel are insufficient, lowering the costs of community funded health care
program and reducing absenteeism from work due to minor symptoms (WHO, 2000). However
it also has potential risks at individual level such as incorrect self-diagnosis and choice of therapy,

incorrect route of administration, severe adverse effects, failure to recognize that the same active
substance is already being taken under a different name and failure to recognize contraindications,
interactions and precautions, incorrect route of administration, inadequate and excessive dosage
and more. Also, self-medication could lead to high drug induced disease and public expenditure
wastefulness.
Self-medication causes adverse reaction and prolonged suffering as well as other related problems
such as wastage of resources and high resistance of pathogens. It is important to note that a current
world-wide problem especially in developing countries where antibiotics are available without
any prescription is antimicrobial resistance (Bennadi, 2014). The overall self-medication rate in
sub-Sahara Africa varies from 11.9% to 75.7%. In Uganda, a high prevalence of self-medication
was previously reported in the northern and southwestern region (Mouankie et al., 2011, Ocan et
al., 2014, Lukyamuzi et al., 2020). Therefore, this research sought to investigated the beharioural
response of the community towards self-medication practices during this COVID-19 pandemic
and lockdown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design, site and population
A cross sectional household and online survey using traditional method (printed questionnaires)
and information technology (Google form) was conducted during the months of June-to-August
2020 in western Uganda. The study was conducted among adult between age 18 above in
communities of western Uganda.
Sample size determination
The population of the western region, one of the four regions of Uganda was 8,874,862 according
to 2014 census (Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2013, Citypopulation.de 2016). With about a
population growth rate of 3.32% (https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/ugandapopulation), the sample size of the study was calculated using the OpenEpi sample size calculator
(Open source statistics for public health. (2013). Accessed: March 9, 2020:
http://openepi.com/SampleSize/SSPropor.htm). The estimated sample size was 280, with a
confidence level of 90% using an anticipated frequency (p) of 50%.
Study participants were selected using a convenience sampling technique and sampling was done
by sending a structured online questionnaire via Google forms to some participants. Also a printed
hard copied self-administered questionnaires were made available to other participants that did
not use the online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 20 questions covering two parts.
The first part of the questionnaire included demographics data of the participants (e.g. age, gender,
education, occupation). While the second part of the questionnaire focused on the self-medication
practice before and during COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality, no
names or email addresses were asked. Those who participated willingly consent to take part in
the study and for quality control, strict parameters were set to ensure participants answer the
questionnaire once.
Data management
The researcher checked all filled data collection tools for validity and completeness. Any
discrepancies in the entries were corrected by referring to the source documents (questionnaires).
Statistical analysis
The data were entered into MS-Excel and OpenEpi version 3.01. Odd ratio and 95% Confidence
interval were calculated using MS-Excel, two-sample independent t test, ANOVA and Chi-square
were the tools used for data analysis with statistical significance level of 0.05.

Ethical Consideration
Expedited ethical clearance was sought from Kampala International University Ethical Review
Committee and registered as Nr.UG-REC-023/201914. Consent to participate was acquired
through online submission of questionnaires and traditional printed and filled questionnaires by
the participants.
RESULTS
Sociodemographic Characteristics of Participants
Our study showed the sociodemographic features of the respondents where most of them were
males 149, (54.8%) and females 124, (45.2%) between ages 25 -34 years (43.8%), Christian
(85.7.8%) and others as shown in Table 1. The percentage of respondents that know about selfmedication is (97%) and those that practice self-medication are approximately (88%). Previous
studies report that generally, people are aware of the effects, potential side effects, misuse and
abuse of OTC drugs.10-12. Our result showed that 97% of respondents have heard about selfmedication either through health workers, media, family members, friends and/or school while
3% said they have not heard about self-medication. There is a statistically significant difference
between those that have heard of self-medication and those that have not. The number of
respondents that knew about self-medication were 146 (98%) male and 119 (96%) female while
those that are not aware of self-medication were 3 (2%) male and 5 (4%) female (OR = 2.0,
95%CI = 0.49, 8.73)

Self-medication Practices Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic
Among the 272 respondents, those who had practice self-medication before COVID-19 pandemic
were 239, (88%) and those that have not were 33, (12%). Those that have practice self-medication
were statistically significantly more that those who have not (P < 0.005 at 95% Confidence
interval) (Figure 2). During COVID-19 pandemic, the respondents who practiced self-medication
were 156, (57%) while those that did not were 116, (43%). There is statistically significant
difference in the number of those that practice self-medication and those that do not p < 0.005 at
95% confidence interval (Figure 3). Also there was a statistically significant decrease in the
number of respondents that practice self-medication during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown
compare to the practice before the pandemic lockdown p < 0.05 at 95% confidence interval (OR
= 5.39, 95% CI = 3.48, 8.32).

Frequency of Self-medication Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic
Considering how often the respondents practice self-medication, our results showed that majority
of the respondents sometimes practice (68, 46% male and 64, 52.5% female) self-medication
before COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. 19 (12.8%) male and 13 (10.7%) female never practice
self-medication before the lockdown. The male respondents that always practice self-medication
were 12 (8.1%) and female (16) 13.1% while those that rarely practice self-medication are 49
(33.1%) male and (29) 23.8% female (OR = 1.0, 95%CI = 1.31, 5.65). A Chi-square test shows a
statistical significant difference between male and female p < 0.05 (Figure 4). During the COVID19 lockdown, the respondents who sometimes practice self-medication were 42 (28.4%) in male

and 35 (28.7%) in female. Those respondents who never engage in self-medication at all are 57
(38.5%) in male and 51 (41.8%) in female. 42 (28.4%) male and 35 (28.7%) female sometimes
practice self-medication while 42 (28.4%) male and 21 (17.2%) female rarely practice selfmedication during the pandemic (OR = 0.96, 95%CI = 1.6, 4.2). A Chi-square test shows a
statistical significant difference between male and female p < 0.05 (Figure 5).

Incidence of Sicknesses Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic
Among 272 respondents, those that never fall sick before COVID-19 pandemic lockdown is 17
(7.4%) in which increases to 81 (35.2%) during the lockdown. 7 (3%) never, 86 (37.2%)
sometimes, 121 (52.4%) rarely practice self-medication before COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,
however, 4 (1.7%) never, 58 (25.2%) sometimes, 87 (37.8%) rarely practice self-medication
during the lockdown (Figure 6). Our result revealed a statistical significant decrease (P < 0.05) in
the incidence of sickness before and during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

Reason for Self-medication Practice
The reasons people self-medicate are numerous, some of which were investigated in this study
and from our respondents 7% fear visiting health facility or hospital, 9% fear been diagnosed
COVID-19 positive, 15% lack the means to get to the health facility/hospital, 37% consider selfmedication affordable while 32% said it is convenience (Figure 7). Generally, most of the
respondents (41%) opined that self-medication should be discouraged, 21% said it should be
encourages, 18% said it is time saving and 23% said it is cheap (Figure 8).

DISCUSSION
Many factors have been reported to affect self-medication practice which includes availability of
drugs, education society and many more (Vizhi & Senapathi 2010; Montastruc et al., 1997;
Habeeb et al., 1993). Our investigation revealed that most of the respondents know about selfmedication and practice it (Figure 1). The rate of self-medication was high at 88% before COVID19 lockdown with more practice shown in the female, but was reduced to 57% during the
lockdown (Figure 2 & 3). The higher rate of self-medication found among females compare to
males in this study is consistent with previous studies (Figueiras et al., 2000 and Awad et al.,
2005)
The World Health Organization (WHO) has continue to promote self-medication as a means to
treat common diseases in the community considering it to be beneficial and helping in decreasing
the burden on health care services especially in developing countries (WHO, 1986). In this respect
self-medication when practiced correctly could be a great benefit to the community during the
COVID-19 lockdown as it allows patients to become responsible and build confidence to manage
their health. Nevertheless, previous studies has showed quite a number of negative effects from
substance use resulting from social isolation such as COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions, with
probable drug abuse associated more to socially isolated people (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010;
Dyal and Valente, 2015; Nino et al., 2016 ), and most likely diagnosed with substance use disorder
(Chou et al., 2011).
Our result shows a significant decrease in the percentage of people that practiced self-medication
before COVID-19 pandemic compared to the percentage of people that practiced self-medication
during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (Fig. 4 & 5). Also there was a decrease in the incidence
of sickness during COVID-19 lockdown as many of the respondents never fall sick during
lockdown (Figure 6). The decrease in the incidence of sickness may be due to the change in
behavior of people as a result of the measures put in place to combat the spread of the disease.
During the lockdown, there is a high propensity for people pay more attention to their health as
people were encouraged to practice more personal hygiene such as washing of hands regularly
and/or using sanitizers, wearing face masks and maintaining social distance which may have
resulted in the improvement of people’s health status in the community. This is consistent with
the report that the incidence of diseases such as infections, trachoma, diarrhea-related diseases,
pneumonia and many more can be decreased by maintaining good personal hygiene (WHO,
2018).
Major reason for self-medication were convenience, affordability, lack of means to the health
facility/hospital, fear of been diagnosed COVIC-19 positive and fear of visiting the health
facility/hospital, time saving (Figure 7). On perception of respondents to self-medication, most
of them (40.6%) opined that self-medication should be discouraged (Figure 8), however the
percentage of respondents practicing self-medication is still high. This may have emanated from
the fact that self-medication practice reduces the time spent waiting for a doctor, can save life in
emergency states and affordable cost of health care (Almasdy & Sherrif, 2011). Also, the World
Health Organization recommended that self-medication can assist in prevention and treatment of
sicknesses where consulting a doctor is not necessary, therefore making treatment of common
illness cheaper. Nevertheless, inappropriate use of medication could lead to a rise in diseases
triggered by abuse and cause waste of public funds (WHO, 2000).
CONCLUSION
Our investigation showed that majority of populace have adequate knowledge of self-medication
as evidenced by higher percentage of respondents in this category and there was a high level selfmedication practice prior to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. However, there was a decrease in

self-medication practices during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown compared to the practice
before the lockdown. This decrease correlates with reduction in the incidence of sickness during
the lockdown which could have resulted from practice of good personal hygiene as recommended
and campaigned by WHO in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. However, WHO has
recommended that self-medication should be taught with the right approach and also properly
regulated so as to prevent drug resistance problems associated with the wrong use of drugs
globally and particularly in developing countries where there is no control of the use antibiotics.
