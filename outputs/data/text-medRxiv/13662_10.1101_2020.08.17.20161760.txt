Abstract

42

Objective: To test whether pregnant and non-pregnant women differ in COVID-19 symptom

43

profile and severity. To extend previous investigations on hospitalized pregnant women to those

44

who did not require hospitalization.

45

Design: Observational study prospectively collecting longitudinal (smartphone application

46

interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data.

47

Setting: Community-based self-participatory citizen surveillance in the United Kingdom, Sweden

48

and the United States of America.

49

Population: Two female community-based cohorts aged 18-44 years. The discovery cohort was

50

drawn from 1,170,315 UK, Sweden and USA women (79 pregnant tested positive) who self-

51

reported status and symptoms longitudinally via smartphone. The replication cohort included

52

1,344,966 USA women (134 pregnant tested positive) who provided cross-sectional self-reports.

53

Methods: Pregnant and non-pregnant were compared for frequencies of symptoms and events,

54

including SARS-CoV-2 testing and hospitalization rates. Multivariable regression was used to

55

investigate symptoms severity and comorbidity effects.

56

Results: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were not different

57

in syndromic severity. Pregnant were more likely to have received testing than non-pregnant,

58

despite reporting fewer symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the

59

syndromic severity in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes

60

increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia

61

[63% pregnant, 92% non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms,

62

including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant

63

women who were hospitalized.

64

Conclusions: Symptom characteristics and severity were comparable among pregnant and non-

65

pregnant women, except for gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-

66

pregnant populations, lung disease and diabetes were associated with increased risk of more severe

67

SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.

Main text
1. Introduction

77

The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a newly identified enveloped RNA-β-

78

coronavirus 1,2. Early on, pregnant women were regarded as vulnerable group, at greater risk of

79

severe morbidity and mortality, based on previous studies of smaller coronavirus outbreaks, and the

80

theoretical risks associated with immunosuppression of pregnancy 3–5. However, substantial

81

literature has now documented that, among hospitalized pregnant women, antecedent symptoms and

82

risk factors for severe disease are similar to those outside pregnancy 6, and few hospitalized

83

pregnant women require admission to intensive care or intubation, although preterm birth,

84

Caesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be increased compared with women without COVID-19, and

85

vertical transmission possible (86 studies to 8 Jun 2020) 7–10. SARS-CoV-2 positive patients

86

develop dry cough, fever, dyspnea, fatigue and bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging in the severe

87

cases 11. Hospitalized pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 manifest similar symptoms 7,12,13.

88

However, little is known about pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the

89

community, many of whom recover without hospitalization 14.

90

Smartphone and web-based applications for population-based syndromic surveillance are citizen

91

science tools that can facilitate rapid acquisition of extensive epidemiological data as a pandemic

92

evolves 15. These data can inform public-health policies, enhance the speed of the healthcare

93

response, shape the community services, and alert the general population to urgent health threats 16.

94

Smartphone applications (apps) were used prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to remotely advise on

95

prenatal health, and maternal health behaviours, including gestational weight gain and smoking

96

cessation 17. Many eHealth initiatives were launched at the onset of the pandemic, with most using

97

single, cross-sectional reporting methods to inform SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology 18. We present

98

findings from a unique, longitudinal community-based symptom-tracking system that identified

99

both test positive and suspected (but untested) SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women, who were

100

followed prospectively to assess the need for hospitalization. Furthermore, we replicated key

101

findings, using an independent, cross-sectional symptom survey.

102

We present data from a cohort of women of childbearing age, including pregnant women who

103

report test-positive SARS-CoV-2. Despite presenting a wide spectrum of disease manifestations,

104

these pregnant women rarely required hospitalization.

105

In order to include non-tested subjects who developed symptoms during the onset of the pandemic,

106

when testing resources were still limited, we developed a model to predict positivity to SARS-CoV-

107

2 based on symptoms, specific to female population in childbearing age. We sought to characterize

108

the differences in the SARS-CoV-2 symptom profiles and severity between pregnant and non-

109

pregnant women who did and did not receive hospitalization. We identified demographic

110

characteristics and comorbidities that modified symptom severity of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy.

111
112

2. Materials and methods

113

2.1 Study Populations

114

We developed a symptom-based prediction method to identify suspected COVID-19 cases among

115

women 18-44 years of age from a discovery cohort. Results were replicated in an independent,

116

cross-sectional cohort with different survey methodology.

117

Discovery Cohort. The COVID Symptom Study smartphone-based application (app), developed by

118

Zoe Global Limited, and having almost four million users from the general population in UK,

119

280,000 from USA and around 175,000 from Sweden. Users self-report daily information about

120

their overall health status, as well as their symptoms (from a pre-defined list, to standardise input)

121

19, 20

122

years, who used the app between 24 March and 7 June 2020, and specified their pregnancy status at

. We included all pre-menopausal (if menopausal status was reported) women aged 18 to 44

123

baseline (pregnant or not pregnant) included symptom profiles, outcomes on testing positive for

124

SARS-CoV-2, and hospitalization (Supplementary Material 1).

125

Replication Cohort. The Facebook COVID-19 Symptom survey, launched in the USA and hosted

126

by the Carnegie Mellon Delphi Research Center. Surveys were conducted using sampling strategies

127

and survey weights to ensure respondents were representative of the USA source population 21

128

(Supplementary Material 1). Using data from launch (6 April 2020) through 7 June 2020, we

129

identified surveys from 1,344,966 female respondents who indicated their pregnancy status and age

130

18-44 years 22. Users specified if they had experienced specific symptoms over the last 24 hours, in

131

addition to answering demographic and infection-related questions.

132

2.2 Pregnancy groups, symptoms, syndromes and outcomes

133

Pregnancy status: Women were divided into pregnant and non-pregnant subgroups, based on self-

134

reported pregnancy status, ascertained once near the start of follow-up in the discovery cohort, and

135

at each survey for the replication cohort. Gestational age, at the time pregnancy was ascertained,

136

was available only for the discovery cohort.

137

COVID-19 Test and Suspected Positive: Self-reported COVID-19 testing was used to identify

138

women with SARS-CoV-2 infection (termed test positive). Test positives were considered

139

symptomatic positive if they reported at least one of the tracked symptoms. The type of test (e.g.

140

PCR, serology) was not ascertained, and those reporting a pending test were excluded.

141

Suspected positive cases were imputed, based on a previously published method for the

142

computation of a test-positive prediction score 20. The model was retrained for pregnancy age

143

distribution, based on a bootstrapped train-test scheme in the discovery cohort, and using a strict

144

mapping to equate symptoms ascertained in both the discovery and replication cohorts. We defined

145

the outcome of suspected COVID-19 (termed suspected positive) for anyone with a score-based

146

imputation probability above a computed threshold (Supplementary Material 2).

147

Hospitalization and Syndrome Severity: Individuals were considered to have been hospitalized

148

when they indicated being either admitted to or discharged from hospital in their daily reporting,

149

within one week before/after reporting at least one of the tracked symptoms. Symptoms, test results

150

and hospitalization can be reported anytime and with no interdependencies in the app, and symptom

151

reporting is not censored after input of test results. Symptom severity was thus defined as the

152

weighted sum of symptoms based on peak presentation when comparing individuals reporting

153

hospital visit with individuals who did not, in the training set of the discovery cohort

154

(Supplementary Material 3). Symptoms were equated in the two cohorts.

155

The weighting was then normalized so that the severity index ranges from 0 (no symptom) to 1 (all

156

symptoms).

157

2.4 Statistical analysis

158

A power analysis was conducted to assess the suitability of the samples size. To account for the

159

difference in age distributions between pregnant and non-pregnant groups, age-standardization was

160

performed, by calculating weights for the non-pregnant women, to standardize to the age-

161

distribution of the pregnant population (Supplementary materials 4 and 5).

162

Symptoms. To explore differences in the symptom profile between pregnant and non-pregnant

163

women who tested or were suspected positive for SARS-CoV-2 and who also required

164

hospitalization or sought care, we applied univariate unconditional age-weighted logistic regression

165

for each of 18 symptoms ascertained in either the discovery cohort, the replication or in both. We

166

then conducted multivariate analysis on symptoms grouped into clusters by body system, as shown

167

in Table 2, and normalized to range from 0 to 1.

168

Severity of syndrome. To assess symptom severity differences between pregnant and non-pregnant

169

women who tested or were suspected positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and were hospitalized,

170

univariate unconditional age-weighted regression was applied to the pregnant and non-pregnant

171

groups of the discovery cohort, with the severity index as a response variable. The analysis was

172

repeated for this cohort among those who reported to have been ‘seen at a hospital for their

173

symptoms’, conditional on those who predicted or tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

174

Hospitalization. To explore differences in the symptom profiles between hospitalized and non-

175

hospitalized pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2, the frequency and percentage of women

176

reporting each symptom were calculated for the discovery cohort. Symptoms were ranked from the

177

most to the least frequently reported.

178

Disease modifiers. To identify demographic characteristics, comorbidities and pre-conditions

179

associated with COVID-19 symptom severity in pregnancy, a multivariate unconditional regression

180

was applied to each dataset, with the severity index as a response variable and age, diabetes, heart,

181

lung (and asthma) and kidney diseases as factors. As the regression investigated within-group

182

factors, age-weighting was not applied. Bonferroni correction for multiple tests was applied.

183

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 16 (discovery cohort) and R 3.6.3

184

(replication cohort).

185
186

3. Results

187

Cohort Characteristics and COVID-19 Outcomes. The discovery cohort (N=400,750

188

participants) was obtained from women (aged 18-44) in the test subset only. It includes longitudinal

189

records from 14,049 pregnant and 386,701 non-pregnant women who had a median duration of

190

follow-up of 18 days (IQR [6-34]) and contributed to an average of 6.6 reports per woman. Among

191

the 45% of pregnant women who self-reported their gestation week at baseline, 14% were in the

192

first trimester, 43% were in the second trimester, and 43% were in the third trimester. The

193

replication cohort consisted of N= 1,344,966 cross-sectional surveys from women aged 18-44. One-

194

time surveys were administered over the 9 week period, at average rate of about 149 thousand

195

surveys per week, using survey methodology. There were 41,796 surveys from women who

196

indicated they were pregnant (3.1% of the source population). Demography was consistent with US

197

age-specific pregnancy rates and stable over the survey period 23.

198

Demographic details are shown in Table 1, together with testing rates. In the discovery cohort, we

199

identified 629 and 25,061 pregnant and non-pregnant women, respectively, who were suspected

200

positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the symptom-score-based imputation method. Of

201

these suspected positive, 21 (3.3%) pregnant and 591 (2.4%) non-pregnant were hospitalized,

202

respectively. In the replication cohort, the proportion of 1,076 (2.9%) suspected positive pregnant

203

was slightly lower compared to 44,772 (4.0%) suspected positive non-pregnant.

208

Symptomatic, Syndromic and Severity Predictors: Frequency of symptoms and body system

209

clusters is reported in Table 2, and graphically in Figure 2. In the discovery cohort, the most

210

frequent symptoms in the hospitalized pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 were persistent

211

cough, headache and anosmia (all 80.0%), chest pain (73.3%), sore throat and fatigue (66.7%). In

212

the replication cohort, among pregnant test positive women who were seen at the hospital for their

213

illness, the most frequent symptoms were fatigue (87.5%), cough (84.6%), nausea or vomiting

214

(78.2%), muscle pain (76.2) and anosmia (75.2%).

In the discovery cohort, univariate analysis on each symptom found significant effect of pregnancy

0.1 to 0.6) but not for the other symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression found lower frequency of

219

neurologic symptoms (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.6) for the positive hospitalized pregnant vs. non

220

pregnant women. Among test positives in the replication cohort, pregnancy status was most

221

strongly associated with increased odds of nausea or vomiting (OR 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5

222

to 3.5) and the oropharyngeal cluster (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.2), even among test positives

223

reporting being seen at a hospital for their illness (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 8.8 and OR 2.1, 95% CI

224

1.1 to 4.1, respectively), indicating how questions are asked can impact symptom profiles in this

225

population (all age-standardized and p<5e-05 Bonferroni corrected).

226

Insert Figure 2 about here

227

Univariate weighted regression also showed that pregnancy had no statistically significant effect on

228

the severity of manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, when expressed as ‘severity index’ in both

229

cohorts (p>0.001, uncorrected to test the null hypothesis). In the discovery cohort, overall duration

230

of disease was similar for pregnant and non-pregnant women. However, time to peak of symptom

231

manifestation was statistically longer in pregnant women (mean time = 2.8 days) than in non-

232

pregnant (2.2 days, p=5.5e-7), though clinically the difference may not be significant. In the

233

replication cohort, pregnant women who tested positive and reported being seen at the hospital

234

similarly reported a longer duration of illness.

235

As mentioned above, in the discovery cohort hospitalized positive pregnant women manifested

236

persistent cough, headache and anosmia (all 80%), chest pain (73.3%), sore throat and fatigue

237

(66.7%) as the most frequent symptoms. Non-hospitalised pregnant women positive for SARS-

238

CoV-2 reported headache (71.9%), anosmia (62.5%), persistent cough (57.8%) and skipped meals

239

(48.4%) most commonly (Figure 3). See Supplementary Material 6 for full list of symptoms and

240

their associated prevalence.

242

Comorbidities: Lung disease was the comorbidity that most impacted on the severity of symptoms

243

in pregnant positive women (t=4.1 for discovery cohort; t=14.1 for replication cohort, all p-

244

val<0.0001 Bonferroni corrected).

245

246

In the replication cohort heart disease (t=7.1) also impacted on the severity of symptoms, followed

by kidney disease (t=4.6) and diabetes (t=3.6, all significant after Bonferroni correction at p-

248

val<0.0001).

249

4. Discussion

250

Main Findings. We studied two large cohorts of women, tested and suspected SARS-CoV-2

251

positive, with self-reported pregnancy status, symptoms and outcomes through participative

252

surveillance. Pregnant women reported more frequent testing for SARS-CoV-2 than non-pregnant

253

women, but generally did not experience more severe disease. Disease trajectories were similar, and

254

the time from onset to peak of symptoms was only slightly longer in pregnant than non-pregnant

255

women (2.8 vs. 2.2 days).

256

Gastrointestinal symptoms were different in pregnant and non-pregnant women with poor

257

outcomes, with decreased skipped meals in the discovery cohort and increased nausea or vomiting

258

in the replication cohort. Neurologic symptoms (only surveyed in the discovery cohort) were

259

decreased in pregnant women.

260

The current epidemiologic literature is largely based on pregnant women admitted to the hospital,

261

which provides a narrow view of the spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection in all pregnant women.

262

Our data show the preponderance of tested positive and even suspected positive pregnant women

263

were not seen at or admitted to the hospital for their illness; most pregnant women reported they

264

recover in the community, as was observed by Lokken et al. 24. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were

265

more frequently reported by pregnant women who were hospitalised. Notably, pre-existing lung

266

disease was confirmed as the largest risk factor to develop more severe COVID-19 symptoms in

267

pregnancy, as it is outside of pregnancy. Heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes were also risk

268

factors.

269

Interpretation. Pregnant women are considered a high-risk group in UK and were considered high

270

risk in the USA early in the pandemic. This likely contributed to the higher testing proportion but

271

lower positives results among pregnant women vs. non-pregnant. Hospitalized pregnant women

presented lower frequency of neurologic symptoms, especially delirium, which were only measured

273

in the discovery cohort. The replication cohort showed higher frequency of gastrointestinal

274

symptoms among pregnant women with more severe outcomes, especially nausea or vomiting in

275

pregnancy, which may be a feature of pregnancy itself (e.g. hyperemesis gravidum). Diarrhoea in

276

positive pregnant women has been previously reported (rates between 8.8% and 14%) 25,26.

277

Syndrome severity did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women in both datasets. This

278

posits an equivalent manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant and non-pregnant, as

279

already reported by Chen and others 9,12.

280

Pre-existing lung disease is the comorbidity with strongest impact on the SARS-CoV-2 infection

281

severity in pregnant women in both cohorts. Lokken et al. 24 similarly reported asthma as a primary

282

risk factor for severe COVID-19 in pregnancy. Heart disease, kidney diseases and diabetes were

283

also associated with severity in the replication cohort which had high enough prevalence of these

284

conditions (related to survey-sampling to the general population) to detect an effect. These

285

comorbidities are consistent with risk factors in the general, non-pregnant population; Li et al.

286

observed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and

287

cerebrovascular diseases had the highest odd ratio for SARS-CoV-2 and admission to the intensive

288

care unit (ICU) 27, while Kumar et al. found diabetes increased SARS-CoV-2 severity and mortality

289

two-fold 28.

290

Cough, chest pain and dyspnea showed much higher incidence in the hospitalized pregnant women,

291

indicating that cardiopulmonary symptoms are the major discriminant for hospitalization. Similarly,

292

Ellington et al 29, found increased ICU admissions and need of mechanical ventilation in pregnant

293

women, although the cohort studied had higher frequency of underlying medical conditions, and

294

might be less representative of the general pregnant population.

295

Pregnant women with pre-existing lung disease or prominent cardiopulmonary symptoms may need

296

special attention during the COVID-19 pandemic; lung disease had strongest impact on syndrome

297

severity while cardiopulmonary symptoms were the main factor predicting hospitalization in

298

pregnancy. Indeed, in pregnancy, cardiopulmonary reserve is limited which increases morbidity and

299

complicates management when there are added physiologic stressors (e.g. asthma exacerbation) 30–

300

32 33

301

diabetes. We confirmed diabetes is associated to increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms 34.

302

This study leveraged two cohorts followed through remote, participatory epidemiology, enabling

303

rapid assessment of COVID-19 in pregnancy. The longitudinal nature of the discovery dataset

304

enabled the comparison of disease duration, time from onset to peak of symptoms, and

305

hospitalization between pregnant and non-pregnant women, prospectively. Broadly, pregnancy does

306

not substantially contribute to morbidity in our community-based cohorts. Clinicians should be

307

more vigilant with pregnant who have pre-existing health conditions, prominent respiratory

308

symptoms or a higher severity index -- as is the case in the general population. Further studies

309

specifically targeting high-risk pregnancies and outcomes across the three trimesters may be

310

warranted, to better define outcomes in this population. Also, we point out the need to interpret

311

hospitalization rates and severity results in light of the policy changes, which can be dependent on

312

the context or country.

. Diabetes was more common in the pregnant women in our cohorts, likely related to gestational

313

Strengths and limitations. Participatory surveillance tools are crucial to epidemiological research

314

and citizen science, as they increase population’s awareness of urgent public health risks, promote

315

public participation into science and enable inclusion in studies of large samples from the

316

community within short time periods. Real-time public health data has been crucial in decision-

317

making during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, user of smartphone applications and web-based

318

surveys may not be representative of the general population, potentially limiting generalizability.

319

Self-reported events may suffer from misclassification bias, which may be differential (e.g. ability

320

to log hospitalization may be higher in less severely affected participants, test results known at the

321

time of cross-sectional symptom reporting may differ). Median app usage was 18 days, which may

322

be insufficient follow-up to ascertain all outcomes. In the discovery cohort, pregnancy status was

323

only queried at the time of registration; women who became pregnant after registration may be

324

misclassified. In addition, gestational age during the infection could not be assessed, as well

325

as whether women were symptomatic at the time of delivery. The replication cohort was designed

326

to be representative of USA population through survey sampling for the active user base and

327

weights with raking to the USA census. Despite the different platforms and country of origin of

328

users, the cross-sectional surveys showed similar results to the detailed longitudinal discovery

329

cohort of technology-aware smartphone users. However, it was not possible to distinguish

330

difference in methodology from country-specific effects. Additionally, we applied age-

331

standardization to account for demographic structure inherent to pregnancy. Despite the differences

332

in the UK, USA and Sweden testing guidelines and healthcare systems, morbidity with COVID-19

333

in pregnancy were comparable. We were able to develop and validate a prediction score for

334

suspected positive, as well as a severity score for use in women of childbearing age, and these

335

performed similarly in the cross-sectional survey data despite development using longitudinal

336

symptom reports. This may be useful for obstetricians in the context of limited access to SARS-

337

CoV-2 testing during this pandemic.

338

Conclusions. Our findings from two large real-time syndromic surveillance technologies provide

339

evidence that most pregnant women in the community who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 are at

340

similar risk of developing either increased morbidity or complex symptomatology compared with

341

non-pregnant women. However, pre-existing lung or cardiac disease may exacerbate

342

cardiopulmonary stress of pregnancy. Pregnant women with comorbidities appear to be at increased

343

risk for severe disease, consistent with evidence from COVID-19 infection in the general

344

population. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions, similar to the general adult population,

345

require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
