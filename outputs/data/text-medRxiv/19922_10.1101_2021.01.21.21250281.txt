Abstract
Background: A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current Covid-19 epidemic. Reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for
clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. Under ideal conditions RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have
analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%. However, when the sample panel is enlarged
including asymptomatic individuals, the sensitivity decreases and false-negative are reported.
Moreover, RT-qPCR requires up to 3-6 hours with most of the time involved in RNA extraction
from swab samples.
Methods: We introduce CovidArray, a microarray-based assay, to detect SARS-CoV-2 markers N1
and N2 in the nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on solid phase hybridization of
fluorescently labelled amplicons upon RNA extraction and reverse transcription. This approach
combines the physical-optical properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to
coat the substrate to obtain a diagnostic tool of great sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an
innovative approach, RNAGEM, to extract and purify viral RNA in less than 15 minutes. To
validate the CovidArray results, we exploited the high sensitivity of the droplet digital PCR
(ddPCR) technique.
Results: We correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs, previously analyzed by RT-qPCR.
Thanks to the CovidArray sensitivity that matches that of the ddPCR, we were able to identify a
false-negative sample.
Conclusions: CovidArray is the first DNA microarray-based assay to detect viral genes in the
swabs. Its high sensitivity and the innovative viral RNA extraction by RNAGEM allows to reduce
both the amount of false negative results and the total analysis time to about 2 hours.

Introduction
In December 2019, an unexplained acute respiratory disease, Covid-19, emerged in Wuhan, China
(1). It was immediately determined that the disease's cause was a novel coronavirus named SARSCoV-2 (2). Since virus identification and sequencing in early January 2020 (3), the primary
approach for detecting viral RNA in respiratory specimens was the reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) (4,5). The RT-qPCR, initially used to confirm
symptomatic patients' diagnosis, was increasingly used to screen asymptomatic contacts and
subjects at risk. Several RT-qPCR assays have been developed and recommended by the World
Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as by private companies (6,7). In the absence of
specific therapeutic drugs for Covid-19, it is essential to detect the disease at early stage and
immediately isolate the infected person from a healthy population. RT-qPCR Covid-19 assays have
analytical sensitivity and specificity greater than 95% (8). However, this number refers to tests
validated under ideal conditions with hospital samples containing viral loads higher than those from
asymptomatic individuals. When the sample panel is enlarged to include asymptomatic individuals,
the sensitivity decreases and false-negative rates between 2% and 33% (8) are reported. In the
current emergency, individuals with Covid-19 that are not identified and quarantined represent a
transmission vector for a larger amount of the population given the highly contagious nature of the
virus. Failures in SARS-CoV-2 detection may be related to multiple preanalytical and analytical
factors, such as lack of standardization for specimen collection, poor storage conditions before
arrival in the laboratory and lack of specialized personnel for collection and analysis of the samples.
Furthermore, poorly validated assays, contamination during the procedure, insufficient viral
specimens or viral load contribute to results' uncertainty. The variable viral load along the disease'
incubation period, or the presence of mutations and PCR inhibitors (9,10) also impact the diagnosis.

In addition, shortage of reagents is also greatly contributing to spread the disease by delaying the
Covid-19 diagnostics and reducing the number of tests available. Many regions around the world
have experienced a shortage of laboratory-based molecular-assay tests. Executing a test requires
about 20 different reagents, consumables, and other pieces of equipment. Of those materials, major
shortages have been reported in RNA-extraction kits (11).
We propose an approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 endowed with high sensitivity, accuracy, and
multiplexing capability based on microarray technology, named CovidArray. The method is based
on solid phase hybridization of fluorescently labelled amplicons upon RNA extraction, and reverse
transcription. Essential features of this system, already successfully applied in liquid biopsy and
prenatal diagnosis (12-14), are: i) the use of crystalline silicon chips coated by a 100 nm thermally
grown silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer to enhance fluorescence signals (15), and ii) the efficient surface
chemistry used to bind to the substrate the oligonucleotide capture probes specific to the virus genes
(16). A three-dimensional coating made of copoly(DMA-NAS-MAPS), a copolymer known for its
high binding capacity and low non-specific adsorption, was used (17). To validate the microarraybased assay results, we exploited the high sensitivity of the droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) technique.
ddPCR, whose limit of detection (LOD) has been shown by several works to be significantly lower
than that of qPCR (18,19), is based on the principles of limited dilution, end-point PCR, and
Poisson statistics, with absolute quantification as its heart (20).
In this work, we followed the guidelines of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RT-qPCR Diagnostic Panel (21) for
the qualitative detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory specimens
(such as nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs). The oligonucleotide primers and probes were
selected from two virus nucleocapsid (N1 and N2) gene regions. An additional set of primers/probe
to detect the human Ribonuclease P gene (RPP30) as a control of nucleic acid extraction in clinical
specimens was also included in the panel. Many available commercial RT-qPCR kits employ
multiplex system capable of detecting 2 or 3 different SARS-CoV-2 targets as well as an internal

control. Similarly, the CovidArray assay is able to perform a multiplex detection of the markers N1,
N2 and RPP30, but, compared to the commercial RT-qPCR kits, our system has the additional
potential to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections
simply by adding new primers and capture probes to the same array.
Another key improvement introduced by CovidArray is the faster analysis time. An important
feature of a diagnostic assay during an outbreak is the overall execution time since a fast method
would allow expanding the analytical throughput. The standard methodology for SARS-CoV-2
detection requires from 3 to 6 hours to run a test (22) with most of the time involved in RNA
extraction from swab samples, with CovidArray the time required is reduced to about 2 hours.
Many commercial RNA extraction kits such as, for example, the Roche MagNA Pure 96 or the
QIAGEN QIAcube kits have been validated for viral RNA extraction purpose (21). Although the
RNA isolation kits are easy to use in automated instruments, it might be necessary to use alternative
approaches to extraction to expand the analytical capability in the case of an epidemic. In this work,
we used an innovative single-tube approach to extract the viral RNA, by employing RNAGEM, a
straightforward temperature-driven enzymatic method to extract RNA, commercially available by
MicroGEM (MicroGEM UK Ltd, Southampton). The main advantages of using this extraction
methodology are: i) minimal pipetting steps (manual or automated) leading to less contamination,
virtually no loss of RNA and reduced amount of plastic consumables (pipette tips, tubes, etc; also in
shortage during this pandemic), ii) no need of using a harsh chemical which eliminates the washing
steps, iii) no need for further purification of the RNA for accurate RT-qPCR and qPCR analysis and
iv) single-tube workflow that provides purified RNA in 10 minutes, v) extraction is conducted using
a common laboratory thermocycler allowing to extract up to 96 samples simultaneously, vi) the
manual steps can be automated easily by using any liquid handler.
Moreover, here we demonstrated that combination of single-tube extraction by RNAGEM with
highly sensitive multiplex microarray substrate with optimal properties allow to reduce the number

of PCR cycles from 40 to 25 and to lead to an overall increase in accuracy and a reduction in
analysis time.
Materials and methods
Materials and reagents
Copoly(DMA-NAS-MAPS) (MCP-4) was obtained by Lucidant Polymers Inc., Sunnyvale CA,
USA. Ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4), ethanolamine and 20X standard saline sodium citrate
(SSC) solution (3 M sodium chloride, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All the oligonucleotides were
synthesized by Metabion International AG (Steinkirchen, Germany). Their sequences are reported
in Supplemental Table1. Untreated silicon/silicon oxide chips with 100 nm thermal grown oxide
(15 x 15 mm) were supplied by SVM, Silicon Valley Microelectronics Inc. (Santa Clara, CA,
USA). Chips were pretreated using a HARRICK Plasma Cleaner, PDC-002 (Ithaca, NY, USA)
connected to an oxygen line.
Spotting is perfomed using a SciFLEXARRAYER S12 (Scienion, Berlin, Germany). InnoScan 710
(Innopsys, Carbonne, France) was used to scan the hybridized chips. Data intensities were extracted
with the Mapix software and the data analysis was performed for each experiment.
A detailed description of the samples collection, RT-qPCR, Reverse Transcription and ddPCR and
2019- CoV Plasmid Controls is provided in the Online Supplemental Data.
RNA extraction for CovidArray analysis
The viral RNA was extracted by mixing 89.5 µL of the inactivated UTM (70°C for 1 h) containing
a nasopharyngeal swab with 0.5 µL of RNAGEM enzyme (MicroGEM UK Ltd, Southampton) and
10 µL of 10X Blue Buffer. Subsequently, the extraction was conducted by incubating the reaction
mix in a thermocycler at 75°C for 5 min and 95°C for 5 min.

The N1, N2 and RPP30 sequences were amplified using the 5’-biotin forward and 5’-Cy3 labelled
reverse primers reported in Supplemental Table 1.
The PCRs were performed in 20 µL of reactions containing 9 µL of cDNA previously diluted 1:20,
200 µM deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1
U of DNA polymerase (FastStart Taq, Roche) and 10 pmoles of each primer.
Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 5 min; 25 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s,
72°C for 30 s and finally 72°C for 10 min.
In addition to the single amplification, we optimized a triplex PCR amplification in which the
primers used for the N1, N2 and RPP30 amplification were mixed in the same PCR mixture.
The triplex PCR was performed in 20 µL of reactions containing 9 µL of diluted cDNA, 10 pmoles
of each primer and 4 µL of 5X HOT FIREPol Blend Master Mix Ready to Load (Solis BioDyne).
Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 12 min; 25 cycles at 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s,
72°C for 30 s and finally 72°C for 7 min.
Microarray preparation
We selected three oligonucleotide sequences from the US CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) Real-Time RT-qPCR Diagnostic Panel corresponding to the two specific probes for the
regions N1 and N2 of the virus nucleocapsid gene and to the human RPP30 gene. In addition, an
oligonucleotide probe, not correlated to any viral or human sequences, was selected as negative
hybridization control. Capture and control probes (reported in Supplemental Table 1), amino
modified at the 5’ end, were dissolved in the printing buffer (150 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.5,
0.01% Sucrose monolaurate) to a concentration of 10 M and printed by a piezoelectric spotter,
SciFLEX ARRAYER S12 (Scienion, Berlin, Germany) on silicon/silicon oxide slides coated with
MCP-4 according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The spotting was performed at 20°
C in an atmosphere of 60% humidity. After the spotting step the chips were incubated overnight and
all residual reactive groups of the coating polymer were blocked as previously described (23).

Microarray hybridization and detection
The products of the PCR reactions were mixed with 2.5 L of 20X SSC hybridization buffer and
brought to the final volume (25 L) with H2O. The mixtures were heated at 95◦C for 5 min to
denature the DNA double strand. The solution was quickly centrifuged and chilled on ice for 1 min
then it was spread onto the microarray. A cover slip (large enough to cover the entire spotted
surface) was carefully placed on the microarray to avoid any bubble captured in. The slides were
incubated in a sealed humid hybridization chamber at room temperature for 15 min. The hybridized
silicon chips were then removed from the hybridization chamber and soaked briefly in 4X SSC
buffer to remove the cover slips. Finally, the chips were washed at room temperature with 0.2X
SSC for 1 min and 0.1X SSC for 1 min and then dried with a nitrogen flow. The hybridized silicon
chips were scanned with InnoScan 710 (Innopsys, Carbonne, France). A green laser (ex 532 nm)
for the Cy3 dye was applied. The photomultiplier (PMT) tube gain and the laser power changed
between different experiments. 16-bit TIFF images were analysed at 5 µm resolution. Data
intensities were extracted with the Mapix software and the data analysis was performed for each
experiment.
Results and discussion
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples with
CovidArray
An oligonucleotide microarray targeting two regions (N1 and N2) of the Sars-CoV-2 nucleocapsid,
and the human RPP30, was developed (Figure 1A). To interpret the results, the indications of the
US CDC qPCR test were followed. In this assay, the fluorescence of capture spots indicates
positivity. Briefly, a specimen is considered positive for SARS-CoV-2 if the two SARS-CoV-2
markers (N1, N2) produce a fluorescence signal that exceeds more than 3 times the standard
deviation the signal of the no-template control (NTC). On the contrary, a specimen is considered

negative if the SARS-CoV-2 markers (N1, N2) show a signal non discernible from that of the NTC.
The RPP30 gene, in a positive sample, may or may not be positive. It is possible that some samples
may fail to exhibit RPP30 fluorescence due to low cell numbers in the original clinical sample. A
negative RPP30 signal does not preclude the presence of Sars-CoV-2 virus RNA in a clinical
specimen. On the other hand, the absence of the RPP30 signal in a negative specimen makes the
result invalid because the presence of a RPP30 signal in a sample negative for N1 and N2 confirms
the correct extraction of RNA.
In this work, to speed up the test, the viral RNA was extracted from the nasopharyngeal swabs
(stored at -80°C) using RNAGEM kit. To optimize the assay and reduce the analysis time, the
transcripts were amplified at different number of cycles (data not show). The optimization showed
that the array is able to detect, after only 25 cycles, amplicons that are detectable at higher number
of cycles with standard RT-qPCR. A decrease of the number of cycles to 25 led to reduction of the
analysis time (1h of reaction).
Firstly, it was demonstrated the correct assignment of samples previously assayed in the laboratory
of Immunology at University of Milan (L. Sacco Hospital) with standard qPCR technology. In
particular, five nasopharyngeal swabs (S1-S5) were analysed, four of which positive for the target
N1 and N2 by RT-qPCR and one negative for both (S3). The four positive samples presented
different viral loads resulting in different threshold cycles (Ct) in qPCR. In particular, for N1, the
sample S1 crossed the threshold line at 20.00 cycles due to its high viral load; also sample S2 has a
high viral load (22.00 cycles) while S4 and S5 have lower viral load and are detected at 38 and 36
cycles respectively (Table 1).

fluorescence in the NTC subarrays is essential as it allows discriminating low-signal samples from
background signals. The same samples were also assayed by ddPCR. Indeed, one of our samples
(S3) from a patient negative according to the RT-qPCR assay, but with symptoms attributable to
Covid-19, was found to be positive by CovidArray in agreement with ddPCR (N1=34.5 copies/µL;
N2= 7.6 copies/µL). CovidArray matches the sensitivity of ddPCR (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Plots showing the relative fluorescence intensity (blue and green bars) of the images in
Figure 1B, and the copies number/L of the corresponding ddPCR (yellow and red bars), for the N1
(A) and N2 (B) markers.

The sensitivity increase of the proposed method reduces the number of false-negative results. It also
shortens the analysis time by reducing the number of PCR cycles required to detect a positivity. The
fluorescence signal intensity of the spots in CovidArray correlates well with the viral load of the
five samples with the higher fluorescence corresponding to the samples with the highest viral load.
The CovidArray was further validated with seven nasopharyngeal swabs from IRCCS Mondino
Foundation (Pavia), previously subjected to solid-phase extraction and RT-qPCR as reported in the
experimental/materials and methods section. A 100% agreement between the two methods was
found (Table 2). The fluorescence images for samples B243, N053 and NTC are shown in
Supplemental Figure 1.

Detection limit of CovidArray
Since the new SARS-CoV-2 emerged, researchers have struggled to develop highly sensitive
molecular techniques to diagnose positive Covid-19 subjects effectively. According to the WHO
and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the gold standard for the diagnosis is
qPCR. However, many studies have highlighted the presence of false negative results in RT-qPCR
(24,25). Therefore, it is worthy to build-up novel robust methodologies that ensure high sensitivity
useful not only for diagnostic purposes but also for the follow-up of patients and for monitoring of
the viral load. To evaluate our method’s sensitivity, serial dilutions of linear DNA standard 2019CoV Plasmid Control were tested using primer sets targeting N1 and N2 regions. The plasmid DNA
was diluted to 50, 25, 5, 2.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.05 copies/L prior to undergo 25 cycles of PCR. To build
the calibration curves for the two viral regions, the capture probes in 36 replicates (6X6 subarrays)
were spotted on different coated silicon chips (one chip for each plasmid concentration). Samples
with decreasing concentration of plasmid DNA were amplified, denatured, and finally hybridized
for 15 minutes at room temperature. The value of fluorescence intensity detected for each of the
seven plasmid concentrations together with the background fluorescence of the control sample with
no plasmid DNA were plotted versus the number of copies of the plasmid per L in the starting

solution. Figure 3A shows the calibration curves for the region N1 and N2, respectively. The LODs
(lowest concentration of detectable plasmid DNA) extrapolated for each marker are reported in
Figure 3B. The determination of LOD is based on the equation: 3.3 σ/s where s is the slope of
calibration curve and σ is the standard deviation of fluorescence background in the controlsample.
The LODs found with this system are 1.16 copies/L for the N1 and 0.81 copies/L for the N2,
respectively. These LODs are comparable with those declared by the various manufacturers of kits
for qPCR with the difference that the number of standard amplification cycles for those methods is
40 while, in our approach only 25 cycles are sufficient to detect the target genes.

One of the peculiar features of microarray technology is its multiplexing capability. Different genes
can be revealed in a single hybridization assay by spotting onto the microarray substrate different
capture probes specific to the target. In this work, we exploited the multiplexing capability of the
CovidArray to detect the presence of the N1, N2 markers of SARS-CoV-2 and the RPP30 control
gene on a single silicon chip in a single hybridization assay. We performed a triplex PCR,
amplifying simultaneously the genes N1, N2 and RPP30 using the cDNA produced by reverse
transcription of the RNA extracted from the same 5 nasopharyngeal swabs as reported in the
“Materials and Method” section. The triplex PCR was hybridized with the probes spotted on the
same substrate. The simultaneous appearance of fluorescence signals on the subarrays
corresponding to the N1 and N2 regions confirmed the positivity of the sample. The fluorescence
signal of the RPP30 subarray was also detectable. In Figure 4B five triplex PCR’ hybridization
results corresponding to the S1-S5 samples are shown. The NTC does not show significant
fluorescence. In Figure 4C the histogram of fluorescence intensity indicates that the samples S1 and
S2 have a higher fluorescence intensity confirming the higher viral load detected by the single-PCR
CovidArray. Sample S3 which was considered negative by the RT-qPCR technique shows a weaker
but detectable signal in agreement with ddPCR and single-PCR CovidArray.

Conclusion
In summary, we describe a novel microarray platform, CovidArray, for the specific and sensitive
detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. This approach combines the physical-optical
properties of the silicon substrate with the surface chemistry used to bind to the substrate the
oligonucleotide capture probes specific to the virus’ genes to obtain a diagnostic tool of great
sensitivity. In agreement with ddPCR, we correctly assigned 12 nasopharyngeal swabs of different
origins. Thanks to the lower limit of detection of CovidArray, we identified a false-negative sample.
Another feature of our system, also due to the high sensitivity of the CovidArray, is the decrease of
the number of PCR cycles required to detect the viral markers which, in turn, leads to a significant

reduction of the analysis time. A further contribution to speeding up the diagnostic assay is the use
of an alternative method for extracting the viral RNA from clinical samples. In this work, we used
an innovative approach, RNAGEM, commercially available by MicroGEM, to extract and purify
viral RNA in less than 15 minutes. The total time required for the molecular test can thus range
from about 3-6 hours of a standard process to about 2 hours with the CovidArray method.
Moreover, RNAGEM provides an alternative to commercial RNA extraction kits that may undergo
a shortage due to their massive use during the pandemic. Furthermore, in this work we have
exploited the multiplexing capability of the microarray technology, to detect the presence of viral
markers and the control sequence in a single assay. Finally, it is worth noticing the versatility of this
approach. In fact, CovidArray could potentially allow differentiating SARS-CoV-2 from other viral
and bacterial respiratory tract infections by merely adding new primers and capture probes to the
same array, becoming a promising diagnostic tool suitable for routine diagnosis of a wide range of
respiratory diseases.
