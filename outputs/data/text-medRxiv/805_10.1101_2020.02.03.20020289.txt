Summary
The outbreak of pneumonia caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was
reported in Wuhan City, China. However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports.
Based on results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea
differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2
as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls
intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used
the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was
highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides,
single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the
proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the
foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells
might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and
diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay
more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.

Introduction
In December 2019, the first pneumonia case caused by a previously unknown
coronavirus 2019-nCoV occurred in Wuhan City, China. Soon afterward, a series of
pneumonia cases caused by 2019-nCoV emerged in other provinces in mainland China.
Subsequently, individuals who were infected by 2019-nCoV traveled globally, and a series

of exported infection cases have been identified in Japan, Korea, the United States,
Canada, France, etc. On January 30, 2020, the WHO has confirmed 7,818 cases
worldwide, and 7,736 cases were reported in China.
According to clinical observation, the most common symptoms were fever, cough,
and myalgia or fatigue. Less common symptoms included sputum production, headache,
hemoptysis, and diarrhea. Based on three recent publications1-3, we compared the
incidence of these common symptoms and found that the incidence of diarrhea
significantly differed in these three reports. As some patients suffering from diarrhea will
first seek help from the gastroenterologist, incorrect estimation of diarrhea may increase
the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in the gastroenterology department. Therefore, a
comprehensive understanding of the clinical features of pneumonia patients will further
improve hospital infection control and reduce healthcare-associated infection.
By using the next-generation sequencing technology, scientists revealed that the
sequence and genome structure of 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV
4,5

. It has been reported that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a

receptor for SARS-CoV by interacting with the spike protein of SARS-CoV6. Because of
the high sequence homology, it is likely that the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shares the
same cell entry receptor ACE2 with that of SARS-CoV. Consistently, four independent
groups have recently provided evidence to support this hypothesis7-10.
In the current study, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed significantly in
three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV receptor ACE2 plays a role in intestinal inflammation
and diarrhea, we subsequently evaluated the expression profiles of ACE2 by analyzing
the RNA-sequencing and single-cell-sequencing data. We found that ACE2 was highly
expressed in the small intestine, especially in the proximal and distal enterocytes. To sum
up, we proposed that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be are more
vulnerable to attack by 2019-nCoV and clinicians should be careful when their patients
complain of diarrhea since the incidence of diarrhea may be underestimated.

Methods
Inter-group difference test
The original information of patients infected by 2019-nCoV infection was retrieved from
three recent publications1-3. The 2019-nCoV infection was laboratory-confirmed by
real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Categorical variables were expressed
as number with percentage in parenthesis. All the variables were compared by Fisher’s
exact test for the three studies as one study has a relatively small sample size1.

Continuous variables were expressed as median with inter-quartile range (IQR) in
parenthesis. A two-sided α of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using the R software, version 3.5.3.

ACE2 expression profile and
The expression profiles of ACE2 from normal human tissues were obtained from public
database NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The original expression data was
collected and then plotted by GraphPad Prism 5.

Single-cell sequencing analysis
The public single-cell RNA-seq sequencing data (GSE92332) was downloaded from the
GEO database. The 10X matrix file of GSE92332_atlas_UMIcounts.txt was used for
subsequent analysis based on R package Seurat (Version 3.1.2). In order to filter out
low-quality cells and low-quality genes, strict parameters, "min.featrue=1000" and
"min.cell=20", were used in the function CreateSeuratObject. The data was subsequently
log-normalized by the function NormalizeData with the default parameters. The genes
with highly variable expression were identified by the function FindVariableGenes. After
the data were processed by the function ScaleData, PCA dimensionality reduction was
performed utilizing the function RunPCA. Based on the analysis by the function of
JackStraw and ScoreJackStraw, the first 15 PCA components were selected for further
two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE). The setting of
k.param was 30 in the function FindNeighbors, and the setting of the resolution was 1.5 in
the function FindClusters. In the downloaded original gene-barcode matrix, Adam L.Haber
and his coworkers had annotated the cell identities of each barcode. In our analysis, the
cell types were identified by the expression of marker genes and the annotation by the
original gene-barcode matrix. Gene expression of different cell types was illustrated by the
functions of FeaturePlot and VlnPlot.

Results
Different incidence of diarrhea during clinical observation
Based on the recent publications, the most common symptoms in patients infected by
2019-nCoV were fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue. A few infected people have
symptoms like diarrhea and headache. However, the incidence of clinical features differs

in different reports. As the clinical symptoms may affect the preliminary diagnostic
accuracy, in order to establish accurate preliminary diagnostic criteria, we compared the
incidence of these common symptoms. We first collected the data from three recent
publications and compared the incidence1-3. Interestingly, we found that the incidence of
leucopenia, fever, and diarrhea in the three studies showed a statistically significant
difference (Table 1). Among these symptoms, diarrhea displayed the smallest p-value (p
value= 0.016), suggesting that the criteria for diagnosing diarrhea may differ in different
hospitals. Due to the different criteria, clinicians may underestimate the value of this
symptom in clinical practice, and it may affect the preliminary diagnostic accuracy.

The expression profiles of ACE2 in healthy people
By using the next-generation sequencing technology, scientists successfully
identified and characterized a novel RNA coronavirus with around 29.8 kilobases in
length5. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome indicates that the genome organization
of this novel coronavirus is most closely related to that of the bat SARS-CoV. Interestingly,
subsequent results showed that 2019-nCoV shared the same cellular entry receptor
ACE2 as SARS-CoV7.
In terms of the importance of ACE2 in modulating intestinal inflammation and
diarrhea11, we examined the expression profiles of ACE2 in various human tissues.
According to the RNA-sequencing data, we found that ACE2 was highly expressed in the
human small intestine (Figure 1). Intriguingly, the RNA level of ACE2 was quite low in lung
tissues.

Identification of ACE2-expressing cells in small intestine by single-cell sequencing
data
Given that the distribution of ACE2 receptor may determine the route of 2019-nCoV
infection and ACE2 is highly expressed in the small intestine, we next evaluated the
expression profiles of ACE2 in different cell populations of the small intestine. Currently,
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology is a powerful tool that enables us to
investigate the ACE2 expression in various cell types and provide quantitative information
at single-cell resolution. Based on the scRNA-Seq data (GSE92332)12, we utilized the
bioinformatics tools to re-analyze the data. In total, we analyzed 7,216 individual cells
derived from the small intestine of normal C57BL/6 mice. Using the unsupervised
graph-based clustering, we found that the small intestine tissues consisted of at least
eight distinct cell clusters according to their corresponding marker gene expression

profiles (Figure 2A&B). For instance, the LGR5 gene was highly expressed in the stem
cell cluster of the small intestine, and it was significantly reduced in other cell clusters
(Figure 2B).
We then focused on ACE2 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in proximal and
distal enterocytes (Figure 2C&D). Enterocytes, also called intestinal absorptive cells, are
simple columnar epithelial cells located in the inner surface of the small and large
intestines. Thus, enterocytes are directly exposed to food and foreign pathogens.
Interestingly, when we examined expression profiles of another two virus receptors
(ANPEP receptor for HCoV-229E virus and DPP4 receptor for MERS-CoV virus), we
found that the RNA levels of these two virus entry receptors were also highly expressed in
proximal or distal enterocytes (Figure 2E-H), consistent with the expression profile of
ACE2. As these three virus receptors (ACE2, ANPEP, and DPP4) displayed significantly
overlapped expression profiles, it is possible that the human intestinal tract may serve as
an alternative infection route for these viruses.

Discussion
Currently, the source and infection routes of 2019-nCoV remain unknown. The
distribution of 2019-nCoV entry receptor determines the path of infection, and the route of
infection is essential for understanding the pathogenesis, both of which are vital for
infection control in hospitals and society. Based on the current findings, we proposed that:
(1) The incidence of diarrhea may be underestimated in previous investigations, and it is
an easily neglected symptom at an early stage; (2) ACE2-expressing small intestinal
epithelium cells might be are more vulnerable to attack by 2019-nCoV.
In this study, we displayed that ACE2 was highly expressed in the small intestine,
especially in proximal and distal enterocytes. Interestingly, another group has recently
reported similar expression pattern in human small intestine one day before our
submission 13. It has been characterized that enterocytes are directly exposed to food and
foreign pathogens. Interestingly, other virus receptors like DPP4 displayed similar
expression patterns as ACE2 in the small intestine. DPP4 is a known receptor for
MERS-CoV through interacting with the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV spike protein.
According to the recent publication, Zhou et al. reported the DPP4-expressing human
intestine cells were highly susceptible to MERS-CoV and supported robust viral
replication14, suggesting that the human intestinal tract may serve as an alternative
infection route for MERS-CoV. In terms of the fact that most of the patients in the outbreak
reported a link to a wild animal market, this observation raises an important question
about whether this virus is transmitted via contaminated food when the food arrives at the

small intestine. Therefore, further investigations are needed to address whether
2019-nCoV targets the human intestinal tract through ACE2 as MERS-CoV does via
DPP4.
It has been reported that ACE2 controls intestinal inflammation and diarrhea.
Therefore, mutual interaction between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 might disrupt the function of
ACE2 and results in diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. According to the data
analysis of three recent reports, we compared the incidence of various symptoms from
infected patients and found that the incidence of diarrhea significantly differed in different
reports. As 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV, and it has been
reported that around 20-25% of SARS patients have diarrhea14, it is confusing to observe
the relatively low incidence (2-3%) of diarrhea in two cohorts from hospitals in Wuhan. If
the incidence of diarrhea is underestimated, the reasons may because it is sometimes
challenging to diagnose diarrhea since we still do not have a precise criterion for it. The
definition of diarrhea by the World Health Organization is having three or more loose or
liquid stools per day or having more stools than a person’s health condition. To a certain
extent, this criterion is subjective.
Taken together, the symptoms of diarrhea could be underestimated. The information
on discharge frequencies and the Bristol stool scale should be carefully collected. When
infected patients with diarrhea go to the gastroenterology department, it will increase the
risk of infection of healthcare workers. To reduce healthcare-associated infection,
clinicians should be careful when their patients complain of diarrhea.
