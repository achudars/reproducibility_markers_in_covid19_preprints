Abstract
Background
Delay in COVID-19 detection has led to a major pandemic. We report rapid early detection
of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), comparing it
to the serostatus of convalescent infection, at an Austrian National Sentinel Surveillance
Practice in an isolated ski-resort serving a population of 22,829 people.

Methods
Retrospective dataset of all 73 patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to
a sentinel practice in the ski-resort of Schladming-Dachstein, Austria, between 24 February
and 03 April, 2020. We split the outbreak in two halves, by dividing the period from the first

to the last case by two, to characterise the following three cohorts of patients with confirmed
infection: people with reactive RT-PCR presenting during the first half (early acute infection)
vs. those presenting in the second half (late acute), and people with non-reactive RT-PCR
(late convalescent). For each cohort we report the number of cases detected, the accuracy of
RT-PCR and the duration of symptoms. We also report multivariate regression of 15 clinical
symptoms as covariates, comparing all people with convalescent infection to those with acute
infection.

Findings
All 73 patients had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. 22 patients were diagnosed with COVID19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7 presenting late acute and 7 late
convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2 negative, and 7 were excluded.
RT-PCR sensitivity was high (100%) among acute presenters, but dropped to 50% in the
second half of the outbreak; specificity was 100%. The mean duration of symptoms was 2
days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, and 4.4 days (1-7) among late acute and 8
days (2-12) among late convalescent presenters respectively. Convalescent infection was only
associated with loss of taste (ORs=6.02;p=0.047). Acute infection was associated with loss of
taste (OR=571.72;p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11;p=0.018), breathlessness
(OR=134.46;p=0.049), and myalgia (OR=121.82;p=0.032); but not loss of smell, fever or
cough.

Interpretation
RT-PCR rapidly and reliably detects early COVID-19 among people presenting with viral
illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly during the early phase of an
outbreak. RT-PCR testing in primary care should be prioritised for effective COVID-19
prevention and control.

Research in Context

Evidence before this study
A comprehensive and effective test-trace-isolate (TTI) strategy is necessary to keep track of
current and future COVID-19 infection in the UK and avoid a secondary wave later this year,
as society reopens. As part of a wider TTI strategy, it is important to assess the feasibility
of COVID-19 testing in primary care. We searched PubMed for implementation of SARSCoV-2 testing in primary care using the following search terms: ("SARS-CoV-2" OR
"COVID-19") AND "testing" AND ("primary care" OR "general practice"). We did not find
any studies that met these criteria.

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, our study provides first evidence that extension of a National Influenza
Surveillance Programme to include SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing in primary care leads to
viral detection among patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like illness during a local
outbreak of COVID-19. We show that the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR), the technique to detect viral RNA, is high (100%) in the initial
phase of the outbreak and among patients who were acutely unwell. Acute infection was
associated with multiply symptoms: loss of taste, nausea and vomiting, breathlessness,
myalgia and sore throat; but not loss of smell, fever or cough. We also show high correlation
between reactive RT-PCR and seropositivity.

Implications of all available evidence
Our findings suggest that RT-PCR can rapidly and reliably detect early COVID-19 among
people presenting with viral illness and multiple symptoms in primary care, particularly
during the early phase of an outbreak. Furthermore RT-PCR testing in primary care can
effectively detect new COVID-19 clusters in the community and should be included in any
strategy for prevention and control of the disease.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, continues to
spread globally with more than 8.5 million cases, and over 450,000 deaths reported as of June
19, 2020. Undetected infection and delays in implementing an effective test-trace-isolate
(TTI) strategy have contributed to the spread of the virus becoming a pandemic. SARS-CoV2 virus has a wide spectrum of manifestations including no symptoms (asymptomatic
infection), mild to moderate to severe flu-like illness, pneumonia and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, multi-organ failure and death.1 As well as the symptoms
associated with flu-like illnesses such as cough, sore throat, fever, fatigue and headaches,
altered taste or smell have recently been accepted as markers of COVID-19 infection.2-4 In
studies to date, the reported time for the infection to become symptomatic (incubation period)
varies among different cohorts and settings, with a median incubation period around 5.1
days,5 infectivity starting 2.3 days before symptom onset, peaking 1-2 days before that,6,7 and
gradually declining over 7-10 days.8,9

SARS-CoV-2 has the potential for ‘superspreading’ events, resulting in clusters of disease
outbreaks among a large number of people.10 Although most infections remain isolated cases,
a small number of individuals (10%) may cause up to 80% of secondary transmissions.11
Undocumented infection may constitute the majority of cases (86%), causing more than half
(55%) of all documented infections.12 Superspreading events have been reported from across
the globe, and countries achieving early viral suppression took rapid and decisive action to
implement comprehensive case identification and testing, combined with contact tracing and
isolation.13,14 For epidemic control of COVID-19, the reproduction number R needs to be less
than 1, so that each newly infected person passes the infection on to less than one other
person, ensuring infections decline. The presence of undetected and persistent infection
within the population, even if very small, can increase R and induce a secondary peak of
infections. Therefore, rapid identification and containment of infection is a key factor for the
prevention of onward transmission and controlling the virus to protect the public.15

In Austria, the first two COVID-19 cases were reported among travelers from Italy from a
hotel in the city of Innsbruck on 25 February, 2020. Multiple superspreading events then
occurred among tourists visiting Austrian ski resorts, including the town of Ischgl, that are

believed to have led to further outbreaks in the tourists’ home countries, including Germany,
Denmark and Sweden.16 Austria was one of the first countries to adopt comprehensive
lockdown measures on March 16, 2020, including protection of vulnerable groups, penalty
fees for breaching self-isolation, and the National health hotline 1450 to facilitate testing at
acute care settings and via mobile units.17 The first death from COVID-19 associated
complications occurred on 12 March, 2020, and as of July 03, 17,959 cases and 705 COVID19 related deaths have been reported.

General practice is considered a key partner in case recording, managing high risk groups and
delivery of equitable care.18-21 The European Centre for Disease Prevent and Control (ECDC)
recommended integration of “COVID-19 surveillance with sentinel surveillance of influenza-like
illness or acute respiratory infection”.22 However, in some countries like the UK and the USA primary
care has been largely excluded from the National TTI strategy.23 From February 24, 2020, SARSCoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was offered to people
presenting with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms to any of the 92 sentinel sites (general practices
and paediatric practices) participating in the Austrian National Influenza Surveillance Network.24 The
new service supplemented the existing National health hotline 1450 for people at risk of COVID-19.25

The overall aim of this work is to explore whether rapid early RT-PCR testing in primary
care can accurately diagnose COVID-19 infection. To attest this we report the outcomes of
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing at a sentinel practice in the ski resort of SchladmingDachstein, Austria. RT-PCR is an established technique to detect viral RNA from
nasopharyngeal sampling used to diagnose COVID-19.26 Our study is the first to suggest RTPCR testing in primary care as an effective method to rapidly, early and accurately diagnose
COVID-19 and an important component of an effective TTI strategy. We report the accuracy
(via sensitivity and specificity) of rapidly deployed RT-PCR testing in patients presenting
with acute infection by comparing it to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody status during
convalescence in the same geographically defined study cohort. We also report the earliness
of viral RNA detection by comparing the duration and number of symptoms among patients
presenting during the first half (early presenters) and the second half (late presenters) of the
outbreak, measured by the number of days from the first to the last case detected and dividing
that period by two. We also identify the key clinical symptoms of acute and convalescent
disease and determine a correlation between these.

Methods
Setting
This study was set in a sentinel general practice participating in the National Influenza
Surveillance Network in the ski resort of Schladming-Dachstein, political subdistrict of
Groebming (population 22,829), Austria. The study was conducted during a local COVID-19
outbreak between March to April 2020, where 29 cases detected by RT-PCR were
documented. All patients presenting with mild to moderate flu-like illness were included.
Following the report of the first cases in Austria, people with flu-like symptoms were advised
to call the National health advice hotline 1450 instead of directly presenting to the hospital or
general practice. Patients were advised to phone the general practitioner or receive hometesting by mobile testing units, and home self-isolate and self-care.

Design
We conducted a longitudinal evaluation comprising a pragmatic cohort to examine the impact
of SARS-Cov-2 RT-PCR testing on COVID-19 case detection. Between 24 February and 03
April 2020, RT-PCR testing and seropositivity data were collected to compare two groups
within this cohort of patients:
• Patients testing RT-PCR reactive at presentation with acute disease
• Patients confirmed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive during the convalescence phase
(confirmed infection).
We define acute disease as the presence of flu-like symptoms combined with reactive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR and positive serostatus; and confirmed infection as the presence of
convalescent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody 3-6 weeks after the acute illness, irrespective of the
RT-PCR result.

Ethics approval
The study used secondary anonymised data for which approval was granted by the University
of Graz Research Ethics Committee, Austria (reference number: 32-429 ex 19/20).

Intervention
Since the winter season 2000/2001, the National Influenza Screening Network has conducted
influenza screening for patients attending sentinel general practices and paediatric practices.24
Between November and March, participating practices routinely collect nasopharyngeal

swabs from patients presenting with flu-like symptoms. Specimens are sent to the Center for
Virology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria, for virus isolation on tissue cultures and
PCR detection. This surveillance programme allows for near real-time recording of seasonal
influenza virus activity in the country. On February 24, 2020, one day before the first two
cases were reported, the National Influenza Screening Network was enhanced to include
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.

Patients with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms calling the study sentinel practice were
offered same day appointments for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. RT-PCR results were
available within 24 hours, and those patients with a reactive outcome were immediately
notified by a clinician and advised to self-isolate for a minimum of two weeks following
National policy at that time. Repeat follow-up RT-PCR was arranged by the local public
health authority (District Captaincy of Liezen, Austria), and people testing non-reactive on
repeat RT-PCR were released from self-isolation. After 3-6 weeks, venous blood was
obtained to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection using ELISA IgG and neutralizing antibody
assay. We defined the period of the outbreak as the number of days from the first patient to
the last patient testing RT-PCR reactive at the practice.

Outcome measures
We characterise the outbreak using the following testing and clinical outcomes: A) As first
outcome we report the diagnostic accuracy (using sensitivity and specificity) of SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR testing among patients with mild to moderate flu-like symptoms at presentation by
comparing it with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody during convalescence. We also report any
alternative diagnoses for patients testing COVID-19 negative; and hospital admission and
death B) As second outcome we report the earliness of RT-PCR testing by comparing the
duration and number of symptoms during the first half of the outbreak (early presenters) and
during the second half of the outbreak (late presenters) C) As third outcome, we identify the
key clinical symptoms associated with RT-PCR reactivity (acute infection) and convalescent
seropositivity (confirmed infection) and determine any potential correlation between these
stages of disease.

Clinical data
We obtained anonymous patient data held within the practice computer system. The practice
lead clinician (OL) generated a clinical master case report form before extracting
pseudonymised patient records into an Excel spreadsheet. EMH and CH verified the accuracy
of the data extraction for all patients. Data were stored on a secure server at the Institute of
General Practice and Evidence-based Health Services Research, University of Graz, Austria,
before sharing it with the study statistician (JPG) using encrypted email and secure storage at
the University of Oxford, UK.

continued for two to three days. NT titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the serum
dilution that protected against virus-induced cytopathic effects. NT titers ≥10 were
considered positive. The study has been reported in accordance with STARI reporting
guidelines for implementation studies.30

Statistical analysis
We present a descriptive statistics of patient demographics including age, gender and
ethnicity; and the following three outcomes:
Outcome 1: We explored the diagnostic accuracy of the RT-PCR, by determining its
sensitivity and specificity. To do this, we stratified RT-PCR results in four groups: true
reactive (RT-PCR reactive and confirmed antibody positive); false reactive (RT-PCR reactive
and antibody negative); true non-reactive (RT-PCR non-reactive, antibody negative); and
false non-reactive (RT-PCR non-reactive, antibody positive).
Outcome 2: We calculated the earliness of RT-PCR testing by projecting the mean duration
of symptoms, in days (range), and mean number of symptoms (range), across the three
cohorts of patients with confirmed infection: early acute, late acute and late convalescent.
The three cohorts were obtained by stratifying people with confirmed infection according to
the date of presentation to the practice during the outbreak as follows: people presenting with
acute infection (RT-PCR reactive, confirmed antibody positive) during the first half of the
outbreak (early acute disease) vs. those people presenting during the second half of the
outbreak (late acute); and those people presenting with convalescent disease (RT-PCR non-

reactive but confirmed antibody positive) in the second half of the outbreak (late
convalescent).
Outcome 3: Multivariate logistic regression explored the association of 15 clinical symptoms
with testing RT-PCR reactive at presentation and among all patients with confirmed
infection. We reported the odds ratios (ORs) and the significance value (p) of each covariate
on testing positive in either case. We quantified the association between patients with
reactive RT-PCR (and confirmed antibody positive) and all patients with confirmed infection,
projecting the correlation coefficient r, and the 95% CI.

Results
Overall testing results
Baseline characteristics for both subgroups were similar for sex, age, and ethnic origin.
Figure 1 shows the flow-chart for the patient cohorts of this study. 73 patients presented with
mild to moderate flu-like illness, all of whom received SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (and influenza
PCR) testing. Of those, 16 (21.9%) tested RT-PCR reactive vs. 57 (78.1%) who tested nonreactive including four that tested influenza PCR reactive. Due to lack of venous blood
sampling, antibody data was not available for 7 patients (1 RT-PCR reactive vs. 6 nonreactive) that were excluded from this analysis. Therefore, of the 66 patients included in this
analysis, 22 patients (33.3%) had Covid-19 infection confirmed by antibody testing and 44
(66.7%) patients were confirmed seronegative. Of all 22 patients with confirmed infection,
eight (early acute presenters) presented in the first half of the outbreak (12 days from March
11 to 22, 2020) and 14 patients presented in the second half (March 23 to April 03, 2020); of
the latter, seven patients were late acute and seven late convalescent. Alternative diagnoses of
the 44 patients who tested SARS-CoV-2 negative included: Influenza and infectious
mononucleosis (N=2, each); bacterial tonsillitis, bacterial pneumonia, bronchitis and
exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (N=1, each) (see flow-chart,
Figure 1). No hospital admissions or deaths were reported.

Specificity and sensitivity of RT-PCR
In the absence of a gold standard, we used a consensus statement on serostatus, irrespective
of RT-PCR outcomes, to establish whether an infection had occurred. We considered an
infection as confirmed in any patient who tested IgG ELISA positive on all five screening
platforms (concordant results) or in any patient with mismatch between ELISA test results

(discordant results) but positive neutralising antibody assay (see flow-chart, Figure 1). Of the
15 patients with reactive RT-PCR, sera from nine patients were concordant positive and six
were discordant; and of the 53 patients with non-reactive RT-PCR, sera from 41 patients
were concordant negative, 5 were concordant positive, and three were discordant. Sera from
two patients diagnosed with Influenza, who tested RT-PCR non-reactive, were concordant
negative and included in this analysis. For the nine patients with discordant results, we used
neutralising antibody assay to confirm infection status. All patients (N=6) with reactive RTPCR were neutralising antibody positive; and of the 3 patients with non-reactive RT-PCR,
two were neutralising antibody positive, and one was negative. Therefore, overall, when
combining ELISA and neutralising antibody assay, 22 patients had confirmed infection, of
whom 15 patients were RT-PCR reactive (true reactive) and 7 were non-reactive (false nonreactive). There were no false reactive RT-PCR results. Therefore, RT-PCR correctly
identified infection in 15/22 patients (overall sensitivity of 68.1%). RT-PCR among all acute
(early and late) presenters and during the first half of the outbreak was high (100%), but
dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak. RT-PCR correctly identified absence of
infection for all 44 patients testing antibody negative (true non-reactive) indicating specificity
of 100%.

Earliness of RT-PCR testing
The mean duration of symptoms was 2 days (range 1-4) among early acute presenters, 4.4
days (range 1-7) among late acute presenters, and 8 days (range 2-12) among people with late
convalescent infection; and 3.9 days (range 1-14) among non-Covid-19 controls (Figure 2C).
The mean number of symptoms was 6.75 (range 4-9) among early acute presenters, 6.86 (312) among late acute presenters and 6.3 (1-11) among people with convalescent infection;
and 5.23 (range 2-11) among non-Covid-19 controls (Figure 2C).

Regression analysis on confirmed infection
Multivariate regression on all 66 patients, including 22 (31.9%) with confirmed infection,
suggested that loss of taste, but not loss of smell, was the key covariate significantly
associated with positive serostatus (ORs=6.03; p=0.047). (Table 1) Breathlessness (OR=6.9,
p=0.054) and cough (OR=0.12, p=0.053) were also possible covariates of confirmed
infection.

Regression analysis on acute disease
All 15 patients with acute disease reported fatigue and therefore, this covariate was removed
from the analysis; and observations from two patients with non-reactive RT-PCR, who did
not report fatigue, were also removed (Table 1). The multivariate logistic regression on the
remaining 66 patients showed that the following covariates were associated with acute
disease: loss of taste (OR=571.72; p=0.029), nausea and vomiting (OR=370.11; p=0.018),
breathlessness (OR=134.46; p=0.049), myalgia (OR=121.82; p=0.032) and sore throat
(OR=0.002, p=0.039); and but not loss of smell (OR=0.37, p=0.607), fever (OR=1.44,
p=0.825) or cough (OR=0.01, p=0.069).

Correlation between acute and confirmed infection
Testing RT-PCR reactive was correlated with testing seropositive for COVID-19 infection
(r=0.77 (95%CI=(0.65,0.89)). Among early and acute presenters, the correlation between the
two tests was perfect (green and amber in Figure 2(a)), irrespective of the stage of the
outbreak; whereas in the second half of the outbreak, RT-PCR did not detect any case with
convalescent infection (red curve on Figure 2(a)).

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, when added to a National
influenza surveillance programme in primary care, can rapidly, early and accurately diagnose
COVID-19 infection. In a cohort of 73 patients tested in the course of the outbreak, 22
patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising: 8 patients presenting early acute, and 7
presenting late acute and 7 late convalescent respectively; 44 patients tested SARS-COV-2
negative, and 7 were excluded. Overall, RT-PCR was 100% specific; and sensitivity among
all acute presenters was 100%, but dropped to 50% in the second half of the outbreak.
Testing RT-PCR reactive showed perfect correlation with seropositivity during the first half
of the outbreak and among early acute and late acute presenters. RT-PCR did, however, not
detect any late convalescent presenters that were identified by antibody testing in the second
half of the outbreak. Strikingly, the mean duration of symptoms of early presenters (2 days)
was less than half of late acute presenters (4.4 days) and a quarter of late convalescent
presenters (8 days). These findings highlight the need to undertake RT-PCR testing rapidly
and early as soon as symptoms occur. The mean number of symptoms was higher among
people with COVID-19 compared to controls. While loss of taste, nausea and vomiting,
breathlessness, myalgia and sore throat were strongly associated with acute infection; loss of
smell, fever and cough were not. Surprisingly, loss of taste, but not any other clinical
symptom, was significantly associated with convalescent infection.

Our study highlights the importance of early RT-PCR testing in primary care among patients
presenting with multiple flu-like symptoms. Our results agree with the findings of the King’s
College group that loss of taste is an overall marker of COVID-19 infection.31 However, our
study suggests that the presence of multiple symptoms among patients presenting shortly
after symptom onset might indicate acute COVID-19. Furthermore, unlike the Kings’ College
study, where the suggestion is made that people use a mobile phone application to selfdiagnose and self-isolate, we suggest that people with acute COVID-19 can be accurately
diagnosed by RT-PCR in primary care. Given the high accuracy of RT-PCR during acute
SARS-CoV-2 infection, a paradigm shift in the management of flu-like illness in primary car
may be needed: active testing of patients presenting within the first 1-2 days of showing
multiple symptoms should be encouraged rather than self-isolation of symptomatic people.
This is aligned to the suggestions in a recent Lancet Editorial.

The outbreak we explored occurred after a three-day party (March 13-15) to celebrate the
premature termination of the skiing season due to the Austrian National lockdown measures
on March 16. The index case was diagnosed on March 11 and the first secondary cases were
reported two days after the celebrations. No other endemic cases were documented in the
region following the last case reported in this study. Superspreading events have been
associated with high intensity aerosol producing activities (shouting, singing) in confined
spaces and paradoxically, the lockdown celebrations might have triggered the local outbreak.
Considering the short incubation period of the virus and high infectiousness around onset of
disease,32 the bulk of cases observed during the first half of the outbreak likely suggests an
initial wave of infections among acutely unwell people following high density aerosol
exposure at the party. Cases identified in the second half of the outbreak might represent a
mix of secondary acute infections, likely occurred in people’s homes, given the strict
lockdown policies, and late presentation of people with convalescent disease. Diversity of
cases in the second half might explain the drop in sensitivity of RT-PCR from 100% initially
by a half later in the outbreak. Hence, our data suggest that nasopharyngeal sampling should
be conducted immediately after symptom onset to increase the likelihood of capturing
infection, particularly during early onset of an outbreak.

Our work is an important step towards primary care testing for COVID-19 infection. Firstly,
our study is the first one to show that early RT-PCR testing in primary care can accurately
detect COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the Austrian experience demonstrates that primary
care can be a reliable partner for the control and prevention of COVID-19. Notably, countries
with major epidemics, including the UK and the USA, have excluded primary care as an
important testing site. Primary care in the UK has highly sophisticated linked searchable
coded systems, meaning that prioritising testing in this setting rapidly creates exceptional
real-time epidemiological data critical to identify risk groups and is capable of evaluating
impacts of interventions such as social distancing and lockdown. Thirdly, evidence from
countries like South Korea,33 where large-scale TTI strategies have been able to control the
spread of COVID-19, and existing modelling studies in the UK34 highlight the need for
comprehensive and effective TTI strategies to prevent onwards transmission of COVID-19
and suppress the virus preventing a secondary epidemic peak. Our study adds to this evidence
and suggests that additional testing should be done in primary care and encouraged as early
as symptoms appear. To our knowledge, our study is the first to highlight the need for largescale and early primary care RT-PCR testing as part of an effective TTI strategy.

Our study has many strengths. Firstly, we included data from a well-established sentinel
practice, participating in the National Influenza Screening Programme, covering a political
subdistrict in Austria. Secondly, national SARS-CoV-2 screening was adopted early, starting
the day before the first two cases were reported in Austria; and 16 of 29 cases documented in
the Schladming-Dachstein region, including the first and the last case, were detected at the
sentinel practice. The National health hotline 1450 and local general practitioners
systematically referred people with mild to moderate symptoms to the sentinel practice, and
patient self-referral was encouraged in the local media and on the practice home page. RTPCR testing was rapidly deployed by offering same day GP appointments, and result
reporting and case notification within 24 hours. To protect patients and staff, an internal
safety protocol was developed to include physical separation of patients presenting with flulike symptoms from those people receiving routine care, use of full personal protective
equipment, and regular self-testing of staff. Rapid adoption of new commercial antibody
platforms (Lab Mustafa, Salzburg) and in-house neutralising antibody testing assay (Medical
University of Vienna) enabled accurate interpretation of RT-PCR results.

There are some limitations of our study. Firstly, we used a relatively small patient cohort
from a single sentinel practice, potentially limiting conclusions on causality and
generalisability of our finding to other areas and secondly, we excluded seven patients for
whom COVID-19 serostatus were not available. Lack of association with high fever and
cough in our COVID-19 cohort, may be due to the National health hotline 1450 directing
patients with more severe disease to attend emergency service. Therefore, people with these
symptoms might have preferred to attend acute services rather than general practice.
Although we collected data prospectively, recall bias cannot be excluded. This could be
suggested by the lack of association of symptoms of acute infection (nausea and vomiting,
breathless and myalgia) among all people confirmed with infection (when including those
with negative RT-PCR), compared to those people presenting early (reactive RT-PCR).
Specific recall bias of taste is less likely, as it featured in both groups and data collection was
completed prior to publication of the first systematic review of altered taste and smell in the
media.3

To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that primary care can contribute to early
case detection and termination of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the community. Our study has

important implications for patients, public health, and health systems; nationally and
internationally for outbreak epidemiology and control. Strict adherence to safety protocols
allows continuation of routine care, potentially reducing the chance of excess non-COVIDrelated and mortality among the practice population. As countries enter the viral suppression
phase, early detection will be crucial in the prevention and control of the disease. Early
testing at onset of disease, followed by timely contact tracing and case isolation of secondary
cases should prevent onward transmission and reduce the reproduction number R below 1.
Austria has increased the number of its sentinels sites from 91 to 231 due to COVID-19,
indicating that primary care has become an essential partner in a comprehensive surveillance
strategy for disease prevention and control. Key priorities for future research include
generalisability of the intervention in multi-ethnic inner-city settings, systematic quantitative
and qualitative evaluation of the Austrian National SARS-CoV-2 screening programme, and
comparative analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with the preceding seasonal influenza
season.
