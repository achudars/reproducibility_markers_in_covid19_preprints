Abstract
Introduction
Antibody response play a fundamental role in the natural history of infectious disease.

A better

understanding of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important for
identifying patients at greater risk of developing a more severe form of disease and with a worse prognosis.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional analysis to determine the presence and the levels of both anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgG and IgA in a cohort of hospitalized patients with confirmed infection at different times in the natural
history of the disease. Patients enrolled when admitted at the emergency department were prospectively
followed up during hospital stay.
Results
Overall, 131 patients were considered with a total of 237 samples processed. Cross-sectional analysis
showed that seroconversion for IgA seems to occur between days 5 and 15 while IgG response seems to
occur slightly later, peaking at day 20 after symptoms onset. Both IgA and IgG were maintained beyond two
months. Severe patients showed a higher IgA response compared with mild patients when analyzing optical
density (8.3 versus 5.6, p < 0.001). Prospective analysis conducted on 55 patients confirmed that IgA appear
slightly earlier than IgG. After stratifying for the severity of disease, both the IgA and IgG response was
more vigorous in severe cases. Moreover, while IgG tended to stabilize, there was a relevant decline after the
first month of IgA levels in mild cases.
Conclusion
IgA and IgG antibody response is closely related although seroconversion for IgA occurs earlier. Both IgA
and IgG are maintained beyond two months. Severe patients showed a more vigorous IgA and IgG response.
IgA levels seem to decline after one month since the onset of symptoms in mild cases.

Introduction
At the end of December 2019, a cluster of patients suffering from a new kind of pneumonia of unknown
etiology has been observed in Wuhan (China) [1]; subsequently, it was attributed to a new virus (SARSCoV-2), a beta-coronavirus phylogenetically similar to the causative agent of SARS, which determines the
respiratory disease then called COVID-19[2].
From December 2019 to today, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has taken on the size of a pandemic[3].
According to the latest WHO data, to date, more than 38 million cases and one million deaths from COVID19 have been confirmed worldwide [4], challenging the healthcare systems all over the world.
Moreover, although mortality from SARS-CoV-2 was found to be lower than that from SARS and MERS,
COVID-19 deaths are greater in absolute number due to the higher transmissibility of this new virus[5].
As a result, public health services around the world have implemented different strategies for rapid
identification of both infected and asymptomatic carriers in order to prevent virus transmission.
To date, direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA throughout real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerasechain-reaction (rtPCR) assay from specimen of upper or lower airways has become the standard method for
diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection in microbiology laboratories worldwide, although these tests have several
limitations and many false negatives have been reported[6].
Recently, detection of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 has also been recognized as deterministic
evidence for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection[6]. However, the role and the pattern of antibody response in
SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet fully understood and many gaps are still present[7].
Neutralizing antibodies play a fundamental role in the clearance of viruses and are used as a gold standard
for the evaluation of immunization in many viral infections.
Previous studies carried out during the SARS epidemic showed that the antibody titer and the rate of
seroconversion were associated with the severity of the disease. In particular, in the study conducted by Lee
et al.[8], seroconversion was observed around the sixteenth day and the peak of IgG was reached at 4 weeks;
moreover, the rapidity of seroconversion (<16 days) was associated with the need for hospitalization in
intensive care unit (ICU), while high IgG antibody titers were associated with the need for ventilation and

hospitalization in ICU. Other studies carried out during SARS epidemic, showed that patients with milder
forms of disease had lower antibody titers[9–12], suggesting that, as observed in other infectious diseases
(such as Dengue), an important humoral response may be associated with an exaggerated immune response
and generate a cytokine storm[13–16], which can contribute to disease progression.
Despite many similarities to SARS-CoV infection, little information is currently available on the role of the
antibody response in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 disease. Moreover, most of the studies available at the
moment explore the characteristic only of IgM and IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 infection[17–20], while
little information are available about all the other mechanisms involved in the immune response, such as, for
example, the role of IgA antibodies.
In the past, several studies have pointed out the crucial role of IgA antibodies as an effective defense against
respiratory infections[21] and previous studies on SARS-CoV have shown similar kinetics of IgA, IgM, and
IgG[13,22].
A better understanding of the immune response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection could be important
for the development of an effective vaccine and for identifying patients at greater risk of developing a more
severe form of disease and with a worse prognosis[17].
In our study we investigate the characteristics of IgA and IgG antibody response in a cohort of patients with
confirmed infection from SARS-COV-2 admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of a referral COVID
Hospital in Italy.

Methods
We conducted an observational, single-center study in a tertiary ED of a university hospital located in Rome,
Italy, currently serving as a referral center for COVID-19.

Aim the of the study
Aim of the study was to describe the pattern of IgG and IgA antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in
hospitalized individuals.
The study involved two kind of analysis:

1. A cross-sectional analysis which had the aim to evaluate the presence and levels of specific IgG and
IgA antibodies at different times in the natural history of the disease in patients referred to the ED or
hospitalized in our institution with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a considered time frame;
2. A prospective observational analysis with the aim to evaluate among patients referred to the ED
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the presence and level of IgA and IgG antibodies at the time
of diagnosis and at different time points after the onset of symptoms.
Furthermore, we assessed whether antibody levels are associated with the severity of infection.

Patient enrollment and study population
Enrollment procedures for both parts of the study are detailed below.
For the prospective analysis all patients presenting to our institution’s ED between May, 1st and May, 31st
who had a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 were evaluated for inclusion in the study; patients who fulfilled
the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study; for each patient, the day of symptoms onset, as recalled by
the patient, was registered and a blood sample for IgA and IgG measurement was drawn.
Subsequently, patients hospitalized in any of the COVID-19-dedicated wards of our institution (either in
COVID-19-dedicated general medical wards, in COVID-19-dedicated ICU or in our institution’s supervised
residential care) underwent blood draw during the course of their illness at 7, 14, 21 days, 1 and 2 months
since the admission.
Such data were analyzed independently from data obtained for the cross-sectional part of the study.
For the cross-sectional analysis, all patients who were hospitalized between May 1st and May 31st in any of
the COVID-19-dedicated wards of our institution (either in the ED, in COVID-19-dedicated general medical
wards, in COVID-19-dedicated ICU or in our institution’s supervised residential care) were evaluated for
inclusion in the present study; patients fulfilling enrollment criteria underwent a single blood draw for IgA
and IgG testing. For each patient, the date of symptoms onset was recorded.
All data point obtained for the prospective enrollment were pooled with those obtained for the crosssectional enrollment before data analysis.

Study Examinations
Blood specimen were collected via venipuncture in a 9ml dry test tube, after discarding the first 2ml of
blood. The variables collected for each patient were the following: age, sex, clinical symptoms, time of onset
of symptoms, radiological investigations (Chest X-ray, Chest CT scan), rt-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on oropharyngeal and naso-pharyngeal swab (and bronchoalveolar lavage if performed), laboratory tests (Hb,
MCV, WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, d-dimer, LDH), need for ICU
admission, outcome of the hospital stay (death or discharge), overall severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection
(asymptomatic, mild disease, interstitial pneumonia without respiratory failure, mild-moderate-severe
ARDS). ARDS and ARDS severity was defined according to generally used international guidelines[23,24].
This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of Helsinki declaration[25].

Assay of IgA and IgG antibodies
Serum was separated by centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min within 12 h of collection. The specimens were
analyzed with SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA kits (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany;www.euroimmun.com) on the
lab workstation platform. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2

Assay is an enzyme-linked

immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that provides semi-quantitative in vitro determination of human antibodies of
immunoglobulin classes IgA and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or EDTA plasma. Each kit contains
microplate strips with 8 break-off reagent wells coated with S1 domain of viral spike protein recombinant of
SARS-CoV-2. In the first reaction step, diluted patient samples are incubated in the wells. In the case of
positive samples, specific antibodies will bind to the antigens. To detect the bound antibodies, a second
incubation is carried out using an enzyme-labelled antihuman IgA or IgG (enzyme conjugate) catalyzing a
color reaction. Results are evaluated semi-quantitatively by calculation of a ratio of the extinction of the
control or patient sample over the extinction of the calibrator. This ratio is interpreted as follows: < 0.8
negative; ≥ 0.8 to < 1.0 borderline; ≥ 1.1 positive.

Statistical analysis
We planned to perform an exploratory data analysis on levels of circulating antibodies at different time
points and on the proportion of patients with positive serological assays at different time points.
First, we divided the same samples in 5-day time periods and we calculated the proportion of positive
patients for each time frame. To detect the most likely time of seroconversion for each antibody class, we
compared the proportion of positive patients for each time frame with the proportion of positive patients of
the subsequent time frame, adjusting significant p values for multiple comparison with the Holm method.
To assess the possible association between antibodies level or antibodies development and severity of
disease, we divided our blood samples according to the maximum severity of the disease. Patients who
developed a moderate or severe ARDS were classified as having severe disease, while other patients were
classified as having mild disease. We compared the rate of positive sample for each class of antibodies
between severe and mild patients both overall and after stratifying by time frame since the onset of
symptoms. For this analysis, the positive/negative result of the antibody detection assay was considered as a
dichotomous variable and each comparison was performed using the Pearson’s chi-square test or the Fisher

exact test, as appropriate. Multiple comparison correction was performed only when a statistically significant
result was found using the Holm procedure. Statistical significance was considered as an alpha level of 0,05,
two-sided.
The degree of antibody response was also compared between patients with severe or mild disease, using the
optical density of the sample as a surrogate for the antibody titer. For this analysis, severe and mild patients
were compared both overall and after stratifying for the above-defined time frames. Given that optical
density is a continuous variable, either the Student’s t-test or the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test were used, as
appropriate. Multiple comparison correction was performed only when statistically significant result was
found using the Holm procedure. Statistical significance was considered as an alpha level of 0,05, two-sided.
It should be noted that this is a descriptive study; thus, calculated p-values are only provided to identify most
pronounced differences and are not meant to quantify the risk of alpha error on hypothesis testing.
Data collection was performed using Microsoft Excel for Office 365 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,
WA, USA). Statistical analysis and plot design were performed with the R statistical language version
4.0.2[26] via the RStudio IDE (RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA, USA)[27], using the Tidyverse package[28].

Results
Patient population and serological samples
Initially, 218 patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 infection were considered for inclusion. Of those, 30
were excluded because they did not have a microbiological confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection; Among
188 patients with confirmed infection, 20 patients were excluded because they were asymptomatic and 37
patients were excluded because the onset of symptoms could not be clearly identified.
Overall, serological samples included in the analysis were obtained from 131 patients (see Table 1). 55
patients had multiple samples drawn during their hospital stay. The median age of our patients was 64 years
(IQR 51.5 – 75) (

). 34 patients developed a severe form of the disease (26%), while 97 were classified as having a mild form
(74%). The median time between symptoms onset and sample collection was 23 days (IQR 12-45, range 188).
Overall, there were a total of 237 samples processed. Each sample was processed both for IgA and for IgG
antibodies. Of those, 183 resulted positive for IgA (77.2%) and 174 for IgG (73.4%).

Cross-sectional analysis
Positivity rate per time frame: IgA
The rate of positive samples for IgA divided per time frame are shown in Table 2.
There were 18 samples drawn in the first 5 days from the onset of symptoms. Of those, 3 tested positive for
IgA (point estimate: 16,7%, 95% CI 4.4 – 42.3%). Similarly, there were 18 samples drawn between day 6
and day 10, and of those only 3 tested positive for IgA (16,7%, 95% CI 4.4 – 42.3%). Conversely, there were
17 samples drawn between day 11 and day 15 and, of those, 12 tested positive for IgA (70.6%, 95% CI 44.088.6%). The point estimate for the proportion of positive samples remained stable over 80% from day 21
onward. There were 26 samples drawn beyond 60 days after the onset of symptoms, all of which tested
positive for IgA (100%, 95% CI 82.2 – 100%).
The highest increase in rate of proportion of positive samples was observed between the second and the third
time frame, that is between the 6-10 days samples and the 11-15 days samples.
Difference between each time frame and the subsequent one showed a peak for samples drawn between days
11 and 15, suggesting that IgA response develop in the majority of patients between day 5 and 15 since the
beginning of symptoms (Figure 1).

Positive rate per time frame: IgG
The rate of positive samples for IgG divided per time frame are given in Table 2.
There were 18 samples drawn in the first 5 days since the onset of symptoms. Of those, 2 tested positive for
IgG (11.1%, 95% CI 1.9 – 36.1%). A similar result applies to the samples drawn between days 6 and 10. A
first increase for the rate of positive samples was observed for the samples drawn between 11 and 15 days

from the onset of symptoms. At this time frame, there were 18 samples and of those, 6 tested positive for IgG
(33.3%, 95% CI 14.4 – 58.8%). A second increase in the rate of positive samples was observed for samples
drawn between 16 and 20 days. At this time frame, there were 17 samples and, of these, 13 tested positive
for IgG (76.5%, 95% CI 49.8 – 92.2%). Of note, the difference between positive rates at time frame 11-15
and 16-20 was the only difference to reach statistical significance, although this significance was not
maintained after correction for multiple comparison with the Holm method. There were 26 samples drawn
beyond 60 days from the onset of symptoms, all of which tested positive for IgG (100%, 95% CI 82.2 –
100%).
Differences between consecutive time frames showed a more marked increase in the rate of positive values
for samples drawn between days 11 and 15 and for samples drawn between days 16 and 20, suggesting that
appearance of IgG may happen between days 6 and 20 (see Figure 1).

Optical density
Overall, there were 237 samples tested for IgA. The median optical density was 4.7 unit (IQR 1.5 – 8.3). The
same 237 samples were also tested for IgG, for which the median optical density was 5.5 (IQR 0.5 – 9.1).
Visual inspection of the dot-plot of optical density versus time showed a similar trend in time for both IgA
and IgG (Figure 2).

Serological response according to severity of disease
After stratifying per time frame and per severity of the disease, there was no statistically significant
difference between severe patients and mild patients in the rate of positive result.
Conversely, there was a statistically significant difference for the overall optical density of IgA between
severe patients and mild patients, with severe patients overall showing a higher optical density for IgA (8.3
versus 5.6, p < 0.001). A smaller difference was observed for IgG, with more severe patients showing an
overall higher optical density, although for IgG statistical significance was not reached (8.4 versus 7.0, p =
0.09) (Figure 3). Such a difference was not observed after stratifying the samples per time since the onset of
symptoms.

Prospective analysis
Fifty-five patients of our sample were prospectively enrolled; for those patients, 161 blood samples were
collected, with an average of 2.93 samples per patient. The average time between the onset of symptoms and
the Ig test was 27.3 days. The longest interval between symptoms onset and Ig test was 88 days. Overall, of
the 161 samples, 117 tested positive for IgA (72.7%, 95% CI 65.8 – 79.6%), while 107 tested positive for
IgG (66.5%, 95% CI 59.2 – 73.8%).
Of those 55 patients, 19 (34.5%) developed a severe form of the disease, while 36 (65.5%) developed a mild
form of the disease.
The trend of antibody response showed that both IgA and IgG became detectable between days 5 and 7 from
the symptoms onset, peaked between days 21 and 27 and remained stable thereafter, with both IgA and IgG
showing a similar trend before day 50. There seemed to be a declining trend for IgA past day 50, while IgG
maintained high levels (Figure 4a).
After dividing patients according to the severity of disease, peak antibody response appeared to be similar
among the two groups. However, there was a more vigorous antibody response both for IgG and IgA in
severe patients. Moreover, while IgG tended to stabilize in mild cases, severe cases showed a trend toward
more sustained antibody response in time. IgA levels peaked at about the same time in mild and severe
patients; however, in mild patients there was a relevant decline after the first month; such a trend was not
observable in severe cases (Figure 4b).

Discussion
Antibody response plays a vital role in viral infections, both for the clearing of the pathogen and for lasting
immunity. Serological assays are widely used for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, there is still
incomplete knowledge about the kinetic of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.
Preliminary data reported by Wu et al. out of 175 patients with mild form of disease who did not require
hospitalization in ICU highlighted the presence of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 10-15 days after
the beginning of the disease. In this paper, however, the authors highlight a rather heterogeneous humoral
response in the study population, identifying approximately 30% of patients analyzed with a low antibody

titer, therefore suggesting that other immune responses may play an important role. It is not yet known
whether these patients are at greater risk of reinfection[29].
Moreover, Zhao et al.[18]

in their study conducted among 173 confirmed patients, found out that

seroconversion rate was 93,1%, 82,7% and 64,7% for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG respectively, and
that median time to Ab, IgM and IgG seroconversion was 11, 12 and 14 days, separately. In this study the
seroconversion of Ab was significantly quicker than that of IgM (p = 0.012) and IgG (p<0.001). According
to the authors, this is maybe because all isotypes of viral specific antibodies, including not only IgM and IgG
but also IgA, can be detected by assay for Ab test.
This evidence supports the hypothesis that other responses to SARS-CoV-2 contribute to virus clearance, and
that, to date, we still do not fully know all the mechanisms involved in the immune response to SARS-CoV2, such as, for example, the role of IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A similar observation has also been
made by Di Giambenedetto et al[19].
Indeed, since the first identification of the SARS-CoV-2, several studies have been published about the
kinetic of IgG and IgM response, while little is still known about the IgA response. It is well known that
mucosal immunity plays a key role in limiting infections by respiratory pathogens[21], and preliminary data
hint that IgA may be an essential part of immune response against SARS-CoV-2 as highlighted from other
authors[30–32]. Thus a better understanding of IgA response is needed for SARS-CoV-2.
In our study, IgA response partially resembles IgG response. However, IgA seroconversion seem to happen
slightly earlier than IgG. Most patients developed IgA between day 11 and 15, with only small increases of
positivity rates thereafter. Conversely, IgG seroconversion seems to occur in a longer time frame, with
patients developing antibodies between day 11 and 20. Both for IgA and IgG, the positivity rate remained
stable over 80% after day 21 and reached 100% for samples drawn beyond day 60. A recent large-scale
seroprevalence study conducted by Gudbjartsson and colleagues showed a similar result, with more than
90% of samples testing positive after the second month since molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
and up to four months[33].
Our data show that there seems to be a difference in the degree of antibody response between mild and
severe patients. Specifically, when analyzing all the samples collected, regardless of the time point, there

seemed to be a more vigorous antibody response in severe cases compared to mild cases. This difference was
more evident for IgA than for IgG. However, we failed to find any difference when blood samples were
stratified for time since the onset of symptoms. The same evidence has been highlighted in the studies
conducted by Huang and collegues and Hasan Ali and collegues where a higher IgA response was observed
in critical and more sever patients[34,35].
Analysis of the prospectively enrolled patients confirmed the findings of the cross-sectional part of the study,
with both IgA and IgG showing a similar trend and with IgA appearing slightly earlier than IgG. Moreover,
IgA showed a slight decline after the first month. Interestingly, when stratifying for the severity of disease,
this decline was evident in mild cases, while no such a decline was observed in severe cases. Unlike IgA,
IgG seemed to remain stable in time. Additionally, in mild cases, both the IgA and IgG response seemed to
be slightly less vigorous than in severe cases. Also the study conducted by Gudbjartsson and colleagues
showed a decline in IgA concentration after the first month[33].
As observed in other infectious diseases, humoral response may be associated with an exaggerated immune
response, which, in turn, may be associated with disease progression and with worse prognosis. This
mechanism has been also hypothesized for COVID19[36–39]. Indeed, we observed an association between
humoral response and severity of disease and such a finding has been reported also by other groups[40].
Interestingly, also the above said-large scale study detected an association between disease severity and
strength of humoral response[33].
Based on these premises, it is also possible to speculate that either a higher initial viral load may both be
associated with a more vigorous antibody response and a more severe disease or that the lack of viral
clearance may be responsible for both sustained inflammation and sustained antibody response (and thus
progression of disease to a more severe form).

Limitations
Our study has several limitations and our results should be interpreted with caution. First, its stated goal is
exploratory in nature. Thus, the result of our study should be used only for hypothesis generation, and not to

be intended as confirmatory. Where statistical significance has been formally calculated, p values below 0,05
should be interpreted as a signal of a possible association, not as a confirmatory result.
Our study included only hospitalized patients or patients in supervised health care setting who were unable to
maintain home isolation, thus generalization to other patients’ populations, especially to asymptomatic
patients, should be done with caution. This is particularly true in the case of association between antibody
response and severity of the disease. While there seemed to be an association between intensity of IgA
response and the severity of the disease when the overall sample was evaluated, we could not find such an
association at the single evaluated time frames. This could be due to lack of association or to the fact that the
sample size for each time frame was too small to detect such an association. Furthermore, patients who were
enrolled in this study were either hospitalized for active disease or had positive swabs for SARS-CoV-2
infection. Thus, they had active antigen stimulation. Our study does not allow us to draw conclusions on
patients who have recovered from their disease or have achieved complete viral clearance.
Moreover, in the prospective part of the study, we only collected blood samples while the patients were
hospitalized. We were not able to collect blood samples at the prespecified time points after patient’s
discharge.
Finally, our institution is a large university hospital that is serving as referral center for the COVID-19
epidemics and our study has been conducted during the initial peak of incidence of COVID-19 in Italy; thus,
generalization of our results to other settings or to other time period should be made with caution.

Conclusion
In summary, IgA and IgG antibody response seem to be closely related. Seroconversion for IgA seems to
occur between days 5 and 15 in almost all symptomatic patients. IgG antibody response seems to occur
slightly later, peaking at day 20 after symptoms onset. Both IgA and IgG are maintained beyond two months
since the beginning of symptoms. There seems to be no correlation between time of antibody response and
severity of the disease while such an association is possible for intensity of antibody response. It is possible
that a more intense IgA and IgG response is developed in patients with more severe form of the disease. IgA
levels seem to decline after one month since the onset of symptoms.
