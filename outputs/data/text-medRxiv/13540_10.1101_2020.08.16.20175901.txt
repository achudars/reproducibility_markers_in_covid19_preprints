Abstract
Background:
As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, 692,000 (August 7, 2020) human lives and counting
have been lost worldwide to COVID-19. Understanding the relationship between short- and
long-term exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes is crucial for
developing solutions to this global crisis.
Objectives:
To conduct a scoping review of epidemiologic research on the link between short- and long-term
exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes.
Method:
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv for
preliminary epidemiological studies of the association between air pollution and COVID-19
health outcomes. 28 papers were finally selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria;
we categorized these studies as long-term studies, short-term time-series studies, or short-term
cross-sectional studies. One study included both short-term time-series and a cross-sectional
study design.
Results:
27 studies of the 28 reported evidence of statistically significant positive associations between
air pollutant exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes; 11 of 12 long-term studies and
all 16 short-term studies reported statistically significant positive associations. The 28 identified
studies included various confounders, spatial and temporal resolutions of pollution
concentrations, and COVID-19 health outcomes.
Discussion:
We discuss methodological challenges and highlight additional research areas based on our
findings. Challenges include data quality issues, ecological study design limitations, improved
adjustment for confounders, exposure errors related to spatial resolution, geographic variability

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is devastating human health in a manner unseen since the last
century. As the pandemic rages on, as of August 7, 2020, the world faces a total of 7.94M
confirmed cases and the loss of 692,000 human lives and counting (Wikipedia 2020). The death
toll in the United States continues to rise and has even surpassed the US death toll during
World War II (Johns Hopkins University and Medicine).

An enormous amount of scientific literature has provided strong evidence that short- and longterm exposure to air pollution leads to an increased risk of mortality and morbidity (US
Environmental Protection Agency 2020). Air pollution contributes to respiratory tract infections,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, and diabetes burden, in addition
to other chronic conditions (Jiang et al. 2016; Lelieveld and Munzel 2019; US Environmental
Protection Agency 2020). A review of evidence supports a relationship between high
concentrations of air pollution and the probability of respiratory viruses negatively impacting the
respiratory system and exacerbating disease severity (Domingo and Rovira 2020). These health
risks are compounded by recent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can exist on particulate matter,
suggesting that air pollution can contribute to viral spread (Setti et al. 2020).

Exposure to air pollutants has been shown to adversely impact respiratory health by inducing
oxidative stress, damaging macrophage cells, decreasing the expression of surfactant proteins,
and increasing the permeability of lung epithelial cells, all of which can reduce resistance to viral
infection (Ciencewicki and Jaspers 2007). In studying outbreaks of SARS, the first human
coronavirus, Cui et al. (2003) provided preliminary evidence of a positive association between
air pollution and case fatality, although their ecological study did not adjust for confounders.
Severe COVID-19 infection is characterized by a high inflammatory burden, and it can cause
viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications including

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Chen et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Mehta et al.
2020; Ruan et al. 2020; Wang D et al. 2020; Xu Z et al. 2020), which has a mortality rate
ranging from 27% to 45% (Diamond et al. 2020). A recent study by our group documented a
statistically significant association between long-term exposures to fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) and ozone and the risk of ARDS among older adults in the United States (Rhee et al.
2019).

To support the scientific community in their work to mitigate risk and develop solutions to
address the global COVID-19 crisis, it is crucial to evaluate the evidence to date on the potential
associations between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. Previous
reviews of this literature (Benmarhnia 2020; Copat et al. 2020) were limited in scope. This
review is unique in its inclusion of both short- and long-term exposure studies as well as a
specific focus on identifying unresolved methodological challenges to understanding the
association between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes. By chronicling
the use of relevant confounders, air pollution datasets, and statistical approaches, we also
highlight future opportunities for research on the intersection between air pollution exposure and
COVID-19 health outcomes.

Methods
Protocols: We conducted this state-of-the science review based on the 5-step process
(identification of the research question, identification of relevant studies, selection of studies to
include based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, charting of the data, summarization results)
outlined by Arksey and O’Malley (Arksey and O'Malley 2005).

Search strategy: We conducted a literature search of the National Library of Medicine’s
PubMed database (National Institutes of Health et al.), Elsevier’s Embase Database, Clarivate

Analytics Web of Science Database, Cochrane’s COVID-19 Study Register, Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory’s medRxiv, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s bioRxiv. The final search date was
June 9, 2020. “Air pollution” and “COVID-19” were used as the keywords for the searches,
along with their synonyms, including “PM2.5,” “PM10,” “particulate,” “NO2,” “ozone,” “O3,” etc.,
for air pollution, and “coronavirus,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “SARSCov19,” etc., for COVID-19. The full
search queries used for each database are provided in Supplemental Materials Table 1.

Study eligibility criteria and study selection: Inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed to
identify original research describing the effects of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes
(Figure 1). We included both published and preprint studies due to the quickly evolving nature of
the topic. Only studies published in English up until June 9, 2020 were included.

Two screeners (AB and JC) reviewed each identified paper from the database searches in the
Covidence online platform. Duplicate papers were removed. The studies were then put through
a coarse-grain selection process in which studies were excluded based on a review of the title
and abstract. Papers that did not discuss air pollution and COVID-19 health outcomes were
excluded. In the second round, full texts were reviewed. Studies that discussed the effects of
short- or long-term exposure to air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes were included.
Studies could report various COVID-19 health outcomes, including case incidence, case-fatality
rate, mortality rate, case hospitalizations, death rate, and secondary cases produced by an
initially infected individual. Studies were neither restricted based on the temporal and spatial
resolution of air pollution data or the COVID-19 health data nor on the basis of confounder
selections.

Any studies investigating the effects of COVID-19 and the lockdowns caused by COVID-19 on
air pollution were excluded as these studies are not the focus of this specific review. Many early

studies described the relationship between COVID-19 cases and air pollution without significant
quantitative or statistical analysis. These studies concluded that air pollution is related to
coronavirus spread because early cases in the pandemic were concentrated in the highly
polluted Po Valley and other highly polluted areas of China (Frontera et al. 2020; Martelletti and
Martelletti 2020). These studies, which provided only cursory analyses, were also excluded.

Data extraction: For each selected study, we extracted information about the title, author, and
which journal/preprint repository it was housed in, as well as geographical area of study,
research question, health outcome, exposure, statistical methods, results, covariates or possible
confounders, and code availability.

Study quality: One study did not describe the statistical methods used but still reported a
significant p-value (Baron et al. 2020) and another study used an unspecified air quality metric
(Bashir et al. 2020).

Results
Selected studies
The search yielded 825 articles across all of the databases (Figure 1). After excluding studies
that did not discuss both air pollution and COVID-19, 80 articles were eligible for full text review.
Of these, only 28 were full studies published in English that investigated the effects of air
pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes. Only 3 of the 28 articles included open access of their
code.

Tables 1-3 present a summary of the 28 selected articles. Table 1 summarizes cross-sectional
studies that focus on the long-term effects of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes (n=12

2020; Ogen 2020; Pansini and Fornacca 2020a, b; Tian H et al. 2020; Tian T et al. 2020;
Travaglio et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020). These studies examined the impact of air pollution
exposure over a long period of time prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The underlying
hypotheses of these studies is that exposure to air pollution over long periods of time negatively
impacts respiratory health, thereby increasing the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
more severe COVID-19 health outcomes. All of these studies relied on a cross-sectional study
design.

Table 2 summarizes time-series studies that focus on the short-term effects of air pollution on
COVID-19 health outcomes (n=9 studies) (Bashir et al. 2020; Han et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020;
Li et al. 2020; Wang B et al. 2020; Xu H et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020a, b; Zhu et al. 2020). These
studies compared day-to-day variations in air pollution with day-to-day variations in COVID-19
health outcomes. Table 3 summarizes cross-sectional studies that focus on the short-term
effects of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes (n=8 studies) (Baron 2020; Frontera et al.
2020; Fronza et al. 2020; Setti et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020a; Yao et al. 2020c; Zhang T et al.
2020; Zhou et al. 2020). These studies compared air pollution levels during the outbreak or
shortly before the outbreak with COVID-19 health outcomes. The underlying hypothesis of both
time-series and cross-sectional studies is that short-term air pollution exposure increases the
transmission of the virus or the severity of COVID-19.

Note that one of the 28 studies included both short-term time-series and short-term crosssectional study designs (Yao et al. 2020a); this study is included in both Tables 2 and 3.

Of the 12 long-term studies, 11 were published in MedRxiv and 1 was published in a peerreviewed journal. Of the 16 short-term studies, 10 were published in MedRxiv and 6 were
published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Location of the studies
The 28 studies examined the effects of air pollution on COVID-19 health outcomes across 9
different countries (China, Italy, USA, France, Iran, Spain, Germany, United Kingdom, and the
Netherlands). Many of the studies focused on cities and provinces in China, regions and
provinces in Italy, and counties in the United States, all regions where the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak occurred early and was prominent. Among the short-term studies, 12 were conducted
in China, 3 in Italy, 1 in the United States, 1 in France, 1 in Germany, and 1 in Spain. Among the
long-term studies, 6 were conducted in Italy, 5 in the United States, 3 in China, 2 in Spain, 2 in
France, 2 in Germany, 2 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Iran, and 1 in the Netherlands.

COVID-19 health outcomes and exposures
5 different COVID-19 health outcomes were included across the 12 long-term studies and 7
different COVID-19 health outcomes were included across the 16 short-term studies. Among the
12 long-term studies, 8 used number of cases, 7 used number of deaths, 1 used casehospitalizations, 1 used case-fatality rate, and 1 used percent of severe infection. Among the 16
short-term studies, 12 used number of cases, 3 used number of deaths, 2 used case-fatality
rate, 2 used basic reproduction number, 1 used ICU admissions, 1 used hospitalized cases, and
1 used a binary variable for epidemic escalation.

The 28 studies also used a variety of air pollution exposures. 11 of the 12 long-term studies
collected air pollution data over extended periods of time ranging from 1 to 16 years. These
studies used data after 1999 and prior to 2020. One study that self-classified as long-term

collected air pollution data from January and February 2020 (Ogen 2020). While this study
included air pollution data prior to the outbreak, it does not fully represent long-term exposure,
as the data were collected over a period of only 2 months. Ten of the long-term studies obtained
air pollution concentrations or air quality index values, and 3 studies used the number of daily
limit exceedances.

The short-term time series studies used daily air pollution data collected over relatively shorter
periods of time, ranging from 17 days to 80 days. These studies used daily air pollution data
during the outbreak with a short lag time to account for incubation period and/or time from
exposure to death. However, Bashir et al. (2020) did not discuss the use of a lag period in their
analyses, which should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results from that study.
Eight of the short-term time-series studies used air pollutant concentrations or air quality index
values, and one study used an unspecified air quality metric provided by the National Weather
Service (Bashir et al. 2020).

Short-term cross-sectional studies used aggregated air pollution data collected before or during
the outbreak. These studies collected air pollution data over periods of time ranging from 1 to 3
months. One of the short-term cross-sectional studies collected air pollution concentration data
based on the number of daily limit exceedances over a period of time (Setti et al. 2020). The
other 7 studies used air pollutant concentrations or air quality index values.

Overall, 21 studies examined PM2.5 (9 long-term, 12 short-term); 16 studied PM10 (7 long-term, 9
short-term); 14 studied NO2 (7 long-term, 7 short-term); 12 studied O3 (8 long-term, 4 shortterm); 7 studied CO (3 long-term, 4 short-term); and 7 studied SO2 (4 long-term, 3 short-term).
Two short-term studies examined Air Quality Index (AQI), 1 long-term study examined NO, 1
long-term study examined aerosols, 1 long-term study examined HCHO, 1 short-term study

looked at NH3, and 1 short-term study included an unspecified air quality metric provided by the
National Weather Service.

Covariates and Confounders
5 of the 12 long-term studies (Table 1) did not consider covariates and confounders in their
analyses. 3 of the 9 short-term time-series studies (Table 2) and 3 of the 8 short-term crosssectional studies (Table 3) did not consider covariates and confounders in their analyses.

Statistical models
There were 8 different statistical models used across the 12 long-term studies and 9 different
statistical models used across the 16 short-term studies. Among the 12 long-term studies, 3
used linear regression, 2 used negative binomial regression, 2 used negative binomial mixed
models, 2 used rank correlation, 1 used descriptive analyses, 1 used non-parametric penalized
linear regression, 1 used Poisson regression, and 1 used Partitioning Around the Medoids
Clustering Algorithm. Among the 16 short-term studies, 8 used linear regression, 2 used
Poisson regression, 2 used rank correlation, 1 used binomial regression, 1 used unspecified
analyses, 1 used artificial neural networks (ANN), 1 used negative binomial regression, 1 used a
generalized additive model with a Gaussian distribution, and 1 used a generalized additive
model with a quasi-Poisson distribution.

Statistically significant results
Of the 28 studies, 27 showed a statistically significant positive association between air pollution
and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes (Figure 2). The only long-term study that did not show
a statistically significant association conducted a descriptive analysis of NO2 and COVID-19
health deaths (Ogen 2020). All of the 16 short-term studies found statistically significant positive
associations between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 outcomes. While 27 of the 28 papers

found a statistically significant positive association between an air pollutant and adverse
COVID-19 health outcomes, not every air pollutant studied was found to be statistically
significant or positively associated with every adverse COVID-19 health outcome studied in
every location studied for every lag period analyzed.

Among the long-term studies, those that found a statistically significant positive association
between a specific air pollutant and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes are as follows: 8 of 9
studies of PM2.5; 5 of 8 studies of O3; 6 of 7 studies of NO2; 6 of 7 studies of PM10; 1 of 4 studies
of SO2; and 2 of 3 studies of CO. The only long-term studies that included HCHO and NO found
a statistically significant positive association. The only long-term study of aerosols did not find a
statistically significant positive association.

Among the short-term studies, those that found a statistically significant positive association
between a specific air pollutant and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes are as follows: all 12
studies of PM2.5; 8 of 9 studies of PM10; 5 of 7 studies of NO2; 3 of 4 studies of O3; and 3 of 4
studies of CO. Of the 3 short-term studies of SO2, none found a statistically significant positive
association with adverse COVID-19 health outcomes, whereas both of the 2 short-term papers
studying AQI found a statistically significant positive association. The only papers studying NH3
and an unspecified air quality metric provided by the National Weather Service also found
statistically significant positive associations with adverse COVID-19 health outcomes.

Discussion
We searched the literature from January 1, 2020 to June 9, 2020 to identify studies that
examined the relationship between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes. The
query yielded papers published in 2020, and 28 papers satisfied our exclusion/inclusion criteria.
These papers used different statistical models, different datasets, and different confounders.

Nonetheless, 27 of the 28 included studies reported some form of statistically significant
association between exposure to air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes.

While researchers want to disseminate their results rapidly to accelerate knowledge about this
pandemic as it unfolds, this practice presented us with many challenges when trying to
understand the results of the selected studies and their implications. Yet, even in pre-pandemic
times, research on the health effects of air pollution is challenging. It is well known that
assessing causality in air pollution epidemiology is complicated by the fact that most studies are
observational with a large number of confounding factors (Dominici and Zigler 2017). There is
also the consistent threat of unmeasured confounding bias. Exposure and outcome
misclassification present further challenges.

When the goal is to determine a clear association between air pollution and its effects on health
outcomes, such as adverse COVID-19 health outcomes, some well-known challenges become
even more serious, and a number of additional complications emerge. These additional
challenges are mostly related to the reality that the data on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are
constantly evolving, come from a variety of sources, and are primarily available only at the
aggregate level (e.g., county, regional, or country level). Indeed, the quality of the data and the
lack of available well-validated electronic health record data at the national level (particularly in
the United States) renders the general challenges in evaluating causality enumerated above
even more difficult to address. We summarize below the most important methodological
challenges, which in turn highlight critically important areas of research that will need to be
pursued.

Data quality: The validity of the health outcome data are questionable, as there is no uniform
case definition of a COVID-19 death and there are also diagnostic errors in COVID-19 cases

(Gandhi and Singh 2020). This could potentially contribute to a high degree of over- or underreporting. Many infected people may have died without ever having been tested for SARS-CoV2, while in other cases, SARS-CoV-2 might have been secondary to the cause of an individual’s
death. Moreover, in the early phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and even in the current
phase of the pandemic, testing was not universally available due to shortages in test kits and
the relatively late adoption of mass-scale testing. Additionally, only a subset of the population
has been tested, and we cannot account for those who are asymptomatic but carry the virus.

Ecological fallacy: 27 of the 28 studies included were ecological studies as opposed to
individual-level studies. The only study conducted at the individual level was conducted by a
group in England, where links between air pollution and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes
were studied by looking at patient health records (Travaglio et al. 2020). Ecological fallacy is a
formal fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data that occurs when inferences about the
nature of individuals are deduced from inferences about the group to which those individuals
belong (see for example (Jackson et al. 2008)). While ecological studies are often very useful at
generating preliminary evidence in data-scarce settings, increasing the scientific rigor of
research in this area requires access to nationally representative, individual-level data on
adverse COVID-19 health outcomes, including information about patients’ residential address,
demographics, and individual-level confounders. This is an enormous challenge that will require
many privacy, legal, and ethical trade-offs (Sittig and Singh 2020).

Other determinants of COVID-19: Ecological data typically do not allow for adjustment by
individual risk factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, or occupation. Age is one of the strongest
predictors of survival for most conditions, including COVID-19. Gender-based differences in
time-activity patterns contribute to different levels of air pollution exposure between men and
women, and women have been shown to be more susceptible to several environmental

exposures (Clougherty 2010). Occupation is also an important factor in this pandemic, as those
who provide medical care and other essential workers, such as those working in meat packing
plants, are at increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 infection (Mutambudzi et al. 2020).

Accounting for difference and socioeconomic status: It is also important to recognize that
disadvantaged people (e.g., those without health insurance, undernourished, and with poorly
managed underlying health conditions, such as cardiovascular conditions and/or diabetes) have
a greater susceptibility for both contracting SARS-CoV-2 and dying from COVID-19. Myriad
social and economic factors contribute to high rates of infection and put individuals at higher risk
from the sequelae of COVID-19, and disparities in COVID-19‒related outcomes may be due to
social deprivation rooted in long-standing racial and socio-economic inequities. This issue has
been raised by a number of authors (see for example (Chowkwanyun and Reed 2020; Yancy
2020)).

Exposure error: In most of the studies reviewed, both long-term and short-term, the same level
of air pollution exposure was assigned to everyone living in large geographical areas. Therefore,
spatial differences in exposure were not captured. Several statistical approaches have been
developed to propagate the different sources of uncertainty associated with exposure error into
the statistical model to estimate health effects (see for example (Dominici et al. 2000; Gryparis
et al. 2009; Szpiro et al. 2011)). These approaches have not yet been implemented in studies of
air pollution exposure and adverse COVID-19 health outcomes.

Physical distancing: The implementation of public health policies, which can vary widely by

flattening the epidemic curve. For example, in Georgia, areas that did not adopt physical
distancing practices experienced higher incidence and mortality from COVID-19 when

compared to other areas in the state that did. Cities in California that tend to have higher levels
of fine particulate matter adopted stay-at-home policies earlier than other regions. Because
these policies differ by regional air pollution levels, including rural and urban areas within the
same county, they can distort the observed associations between air pollution and adverse
COVID-19 health outcomes.

Timing on the epidemic curve: There will be temporal differences in the number of incident
COVID-19 cases, and by extension in COVID-19‒related deaths, by region. US counties were
at very different stages on the epidemic curves, especially in early April. Larger cities are more
populous and tend to have increased travel to and from international locations, providing
increased opportunity for the spread of COVID-19 early in the pandemic. These larger cities
also tend to have higher concentrations of air pollution. The practical implications are that there
will be a greater number of incident cases and deaths in those cities that are further along on
the epidemic curve, which further confounds analysis.

Clustering of cases and deaths: Unlike studies of long-term exposure to air pollution and
chronic diseases where deaths can reasonably be assumed to be independent, COVID-19
cases and deaths tend to occur in clusters. This has been widely reported, such as the now
famous choir practice where a large portion of attendees became ill or the tragic events in
congregant settings such as retirement homes and long-term care facilities. Although some of
the studies’ authors included random effects to account for clustering, without individual-level
data, it is simply not possible to account for this clustering.

Reproducibility: To discover crucial linkages between air pollution and adverse COVID-19
outcomes in a more definitive, causal manner, both the data used for the analyses as well as
the code should be made publicly available. Transparency and shared resources will assist in

the global push towards uncovering the solutions to the pandemic and instituting public policies
that will protect the health of people worldwide. Only two of the 28 selected papers included
publicly-available code. Many of the selected papers were in preprint format, and access to
code will be critical to validate results and build upon the conclusions. It is difficult to reproduce
results and continue work on these areas without code availability.

Conclusion
Assessing the short- and long-term effects of air pollution on adverse COVID-19 health
outcomes is a rapidly evolving area of research. Most of these studies are still in the preprint
stage and many more studies will likely be published in the next few weeks and months.
Therefore, our aim was to identify this topic as a critically important area of research, identify the
numerous methodological challenges, and inform future research. Despite the preliminary
nature of the evidence summarized in this scoping review, our findings underscore the need to
hold governments accountable for the installation of environmental protections that will
permanently maintain safe levels of air pollution to protect human health, rather than removing
those environmental protections at the behest of the industries that pollute our environment. In
the era of climate change, and now global pandemics, studies like these are among many
calling for action to protect the earth systems that are so deeply intertwined with human
systems, particularly systems of human health.

A primary goal of this scoping review was to begin paving the way toward overcoming the many
methodological challenges that are inherent in studies of environmental health epidemiology.
Some of these challenges are common to all epidemiological studies of air pollution and health
outcomes (e.g., exposure error, measured and unmeasured bias), while others are exacerbated
in the study of adverse COVID-19 health outcomes (e.g., outcome misclassification, evolving

number of new cases and deaths) and global pandemics (e.g., accounting for different testing
practices, different stages of the pandemic).

With respect to these new challenges, it is just as important to highlight new opportunities. For
example, the extreme measures implemented during the lockdown are providing new research
opportunities to investigate important questions regarding achievable reductions in air pollution
exposure and health effects. Indeed, in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and to
protect lives, countries across the globe instituted temporary, and in many cases, continued
closures of all but essential businesses and services, instituting lockdowns to encourage people
to stay at home and prevent the spread of disease. This has resulted in significantly lower levels
of vehicular, train, aircraft, and industry related emissions (Le Quéré et al. 2020; Shilling and
Waetjen 2020; Zhang R et al. 2020). These lockdown measures provide a unique opportunity to
exploit the features of a quasi-experimental design to assess the extent to which different
pollutants have declined and estimate the potential “beneficial” effects of these declines on
health outcomes.
