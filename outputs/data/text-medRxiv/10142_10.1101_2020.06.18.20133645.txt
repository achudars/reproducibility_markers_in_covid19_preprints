ABSTRACT
Background
The impact of inflammatory rheumatic diseases on COVID-19 severity is poorly known.
Here we compare the outcomes of a cohort of rheumatic patients with a matched
control cohort to identify potential risk factors for severe illness.
Methods
In this comparative cohort study, we identified hospital PCR+ COVID-19 rheumatic
patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis (IA) or autoimmune/immunomediated
diseases (AI/IMID). Non-rheumatic controls were randomly sampled 1:1, and matched
by age, sex, and PCR date. The main outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as
death, invasive ventilation, ICU admission, or serious complications. We assessed the
association between the outcome and potential prognostic variables, adjusted by
COVID treatment, using logistic regression.
Results
The cohorts were composed of 456 rheumatic and non-rheumatic patients, in equal
numbers. Mean age was 63 [IQR 53-78] and male sex 41% in both cohorts. Rheumatic
diseases were IA (60%) and AI/IMID (40%). Most patients (74%) had been
hospitalised, and the risk of severe COVID was 31·6% in the rheumatic and 28·1% in
the non-rheumatic cohort. Ageing, male sex and previous comorbidity (obesity,
diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular, or lung disease) increased the risk in the
rheumatic cohort by bivariate analysis. In logistic regression analysis, independent
factors associated with severe COVID were increased age (OR 5·31; CI 3·14-8·95),
male sex (2·13; CI 1·35-3·36) and having an AI/IMID (OR 1·98; CI 1·15-3·41).
Conclusion
In patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases aging, sex and having an
AI/IMID but not IA nor previous immunosuppressive therapies were associated with
severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection is quite broad, ranging from
asymptomatic to life-threatening or fatal disease. Different factors have been
associated to poor prognosis, including older age, gender, and pre-existing
comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and lung and cardiovascular disease The
risk for severe COVID-19 has been associated with older age, gender, and pre-existing
morbidities such as diabetes, lung and cardiovascular disease including hypertension
[1-3]. Immune-mediated conditions and immunosuppressive therapies increase the
susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections and therefore, understanding how COVID19 impacts on these patients is an urgent need [4-6].
Since the severity of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory process, it is
also of particular interest to investigate how pre-existing immune disturbances or the
previous use of immunosuppressive agents influence COVID-19 expression [7]. We
have previously reported an increased prevalence of hospital attended COVID-19 in
patients with AI/IMID, and specifically in those on ts/dDMARD therapy, compared to a
reference population, reflecting either increased risk of infection or increased severity
[8]. In the larger COVID-19 series, neither AI/IMID nor immunosuppressive therapies
are represented, but incompleteness of information on these specific factors is possible
[1-3]. In recent report of a small cohort of hospitalized rheumatic patients, a higher
need for mechanical ventilation compared to non-rheumatic controls has been reported
[9]. A global registry of rheumatic patients found corticosteroids (CS) but not other
therapies to a higher risk for hospitalization [10]. In patients with inflammatory bowel
disease, CS but not anti-TNF-α drugs independently increase the risk of severe
disease [11]. Other immunosuppressed patients, as solid organ transplanted, have
more severe COVID-19, however the role of age or comorbidities, and the lack of
controls do not permit to draw definitive conclusions [12,13].

An additional concern among rheumatologists is that in most chronic inflammatory
rheumatic diseases, clinical and subclinical metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidity is
increased. which may also put these patients at higher risk of poor outcomes [14, 15]. It
is therefore necessary for contingency prevention plans, to identify vulnerable patients
and specific features at high risk requiring special vigilance or management.
We undertook a multicentric comparative cohort study to investigate the relationship
between underlying rheumatic disease and COVID-19 outcomes and to identify specific
risk factors associated to poor outcomes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
We performed a retrospective observational matched-cohort study from the databases
of five reference centres pertaining to a public research network for the investigation of
inflammation and rheumatic diseases (RIER, https://red-rier.org/). Each of the included
centres have accessibility to updated medical records ID lists of adult patients under
follow-up in rheumatology departments, and were reference centres for microbiology,
where all SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic tests in the covered population were
performed. Patients’ medical record IDs were matched against central SARS-CoV-2+
PCR hospital registers up to April 17th, just after the incidence peak of SARS-CoV-2
infection had been reached in Spain [https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19]. Electronic
medical records were reviewed to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis and to obtain clinical
data. Since at that time, availability of CoV-2 PCR testing was limited due to shortages,
these registries only include patients attending referral hospitals, and exclude the less
severe community cases that did not require hospitalization nor referral to hospitals
emergency departments.
The rheumatology cohort included all adult patients diagnosed of chronic inflammatory
arthritis (IA), including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and spondyloarthritis

(SpA); AI/IMID, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome
(SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), vasculitides etc
(Supplementary Table S1) with a PCR+ COVID-19 diagnosis. The control cohort was
assembled from the Microbiology databases of the participating centres matched on a
1:1 basis with the rheumatic cohort on the date of COVID-19 diagnosis (“index date”),
sex, and age, and blinded to outcome or other variables. In this control cohort, patients
with IA/IMID were excluded.
Variables and measurements
We collected the following data from the electronic health record to descrive COVID-19
evolution: evidence of pneumonia by plain X-ray, respiratory insufficiency, oxygen
necessities (collected as ordinal variable ranging from 0 “no external oxygen required”,
to 1 “oxygen by nasal cannula”, 2 “reservoir”, 3 “non-invasive ventilation”, and 4
“tracheal intubation”), serious life threatening complications (myocarditis or heart
failure, encephalopathy, thrombosis, kidney failure or septic shock), duration of
admission, and exitus. Laboratory data were also collected at baseline and at peak
levels for the following variables: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6),
lymphocyte counts, D-Dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ferritin.
The primary outcome was a composite outcome, ‘severe COVID’, including death, ICU
admission, intratracheal intubation, or serious COVID-19 complications. Factors
studied in relation to the outcome were those common to all COVID patients, such as
age (with a cut-off at 60 years), male sex, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes,
hypertension, and lung disease. Specific factors for rheumatic diseases included
diagnostic group, disease duration, treatments—such as glucocorticoids (GC),
conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs csDMARD, other
immunosuppressants (including azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mofetil
mycophenolate, and calcineurin inhibitors), or ts/bDMARD, including jakinibs (tofacitinib
or baricitinib), or any biological agent (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 or IL23/17 antagonists,

abatacept or rituximab). COVID-19 treatment was also collected and treated as
potentially confounding covariate. The most commonly used treatments were
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir), GC and anticytokines. We used summary statistics to describe the cohorts, and t tests, chi-square,
Fisher’s exact, and log rank tests to refute hypothetical differences between them. For
time to variables we used May 15th as censor date.
We then estimated the risk to develop severe COVID in each cohort, in terms of point
estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI), risk difference, risk ratio, and attributable
fractions for the rheumatic and total population. The relative risk of prognostic factors
was estimated, and the hypothesis of an effect modification of having an AI/IMID
rheumatic disease tested with the Mantel-Haenszel method.
Subsequently we run bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models to assess
the association rheumatic diseases and severe COVID in detail, where the composite
outcome was the dependent variable. We used several approaches to building the
models: (1) using the allsets command, (2) automatic backward stepwise starting with
a full model with all variables with a p-value < 0·25 in the bivariable, and (3) a manual
stepwise method, keeping cohort and confounding variables in the model. The best
model was selected on the basis of the AIC and BIC criteria, and the area under the
ROC curve and predictive capacity of the best model estimated. All analyses were
done in Stata 12 (College Station, Texas, USA).
All data were anonymised, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Hospital 12 de Octubre Hospital in April 3th , with ref Nº CEIm: 20/160.

RESULTS
The total sample was 456, evenly distributed into 228 patients per cohort. The
diagnoses of rheumatic patients were IA (n=136, 60%): RA (n=65, 29%), SpA (n=35,
16%), PsA (n=36, 15%), and AI/IMID (92, 40%) as detailed in Table S1. The mean
duration of the rheumatic disease was 10 years (SD 8·3) with no differences across
diseases.
Table 1 shows a description of both cohorts. These were matched in terms of age and
sex, and well balanced regarding most other variables. However, clinician reported
obesity, and cardiovascular disease were more frequent among rheumatic patients
versus controls.

The risk of a severe COVID was 28·1% in the non-rheumatic cohort and of 31·6% in
the rheumatic cohort, i.e., a risk difference of 3·5% (95% CI: -4·9% to 11·9%), a risk
ratio of 1·13 (95% CI 0·84 to 1·49), an attributable fraction of the exposed of 11·1%,
and in the population of 5·9% (p = 0·413).
Table 4 shows the relative risk of variables common to both cohorts, by cohort. Age
≥60 and all comorbid variables were associated with outcome in the rheumatic cohort,
but only age, hypertension and lung disease not in the non-rheumatic cohort. No clear
effect modification of the cohort on the associations was present, as by the results of
the homogeneity test.

An independent association between AI/IMID (OR 1·98; CI 1·15-3·41), age (OR 5·31;
CI 3·14 - 8·95), and male sex (OR 2·13; OR 1·35 - 3·36) with higher risks for the
composite severe COVID-19 outcome was found, whereas all other factors IA,
comorbidities and active anti-rheumatic therapies were not confirmed in the
multivariable adjusted analysis. A higher use of antivirals also remained associated to
severity.

DISCUSSION

In this matched-cohort study, we show that among hospital patients with chronic
inflammatory rheumatic diseases, having a systemic AI/IMID but not an IA is an
independent risk factor for poor COVID outcomes including death, invasive ventilation,
ICU admission or serious complications. Comorbidities known to associate with severe
COVID-19 in the general population, are also associated with greater risk to these

patients by bivariable analyses [1-3, 14]. This observation is of particular interest,
because some of them as cardiovascular disease, obesity and metabolic syndrome,
are also associated with inflammatory disease as also shown in our cohort [15,16].
However, there was no statistically significant association between these morbidities
and severity by multivariable analysis, suggesting collinearity with ageing and
inflammatory disease.
Our data are in agreement with a previous study in a smaller COVID-19 hospitalized
cohort, which also identified a higher odds of intensive care admission/mechanical
ventilation among hospitalised patients with rheumatic disease versus matched
controls [9]. In contrast with ours, this study combined IA and AI/IMID patients. Our
data illustrate how these groups may carry a different risk for severe COVID-19. In the
present study, only AI/IMID patients show a higher risk whereas IA patients do not.
Whether specific diagnostics among these groups may have a different risk cannot be
ruled-out due to statistical power limitation. In our previous prevalence analysis,
hospital cases were more prevalent among SpA but not RA or PSA groups, and in
AI/IMID groups but not SLE patients compared to the reference population [8]. Further
analyses would be needed to evaluate the severity of specific rheumatic diseases.
Concerning previous use of therapies by rheumatic patients, the use of glucocorticoids
was associated with poorer outcome by bivariable analysis, whereas no substantial risk
was detected neither for traditional immunosuppressants nor csDMARDS
(methothrexate and leflunomide), nor for bDMARD (mostly anti-TNF-α). Interestingly,
the use of ts/bDMARD was associated in the bivariable with lower odds of
complications. They did not make it into the final models probably because of the
collinearity with other variables and not being the full rheumatic sample included, thus
encountering problems of statistical power.
The potential therapeutic effect of anti-cytokine biologicals and Jakinibs on COVID-19
is being tested through numerous observational and randomised trials [17]. Since most

of these drugs have long-lived pharmacological or immunological effects, a protective
effect could hypothetically exist after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our previous analysis of
the prevalence of hospital PCR+ cases in rheumatic patients and the general
population, a higher prevalence was observed in ts/bDMARD but not csDMARD
treated patients [8]. Therefore, our observations regarding ts/bDMARD should be
considered with caution because we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding by
indication of the therapies in the different included diseases i.e. the preferential use of
ts/bDMARD in IA. Larger cohorts of patients treated with these drugs or meta-analysis
are warranted to clarify the real impact of ts/bDMARD on COVID-19 susceptibility or
severity in rheumatic patients.
Our study has additional limitations. In the time frame where the study was performed
in Spain, due to testing shortages, PCR testing selected a population with a certain
level of severity since testing of mild cases in the community was not performed.
Therefore, we could not introduce the analysis of the full spectrum of the disease,
excluding a large proportion of rheumatic patients with a less severe COVID-19.
Since each matched control was also selected in the same date of each case, this was
not expected to introduce differences in patients’ profiles. As rheumatic patients and
matched controls were selected on the same date, we do not expect to have selection
bias. However, fewer patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and a
numerical trend towards less respiratory insufficiency and oxygen need were observed
in rheumatic patients. This might indicate either a milder expression of lung
inflammation in these patients, despite the worse outcome of some groups, or a bias
towards more frequent hospital admission and PCR testing due to a higher perception
of risk of rheumatic patients.
Since ageing and having an AI/IIMID disease are the most relevant risk factors for
severe COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease, shared immune-pathogenetic
factors that might modify defensive and inflammatory responses need to be identified.

Exhaustion of adaptive T-cell responses and increased effector inflammatory
responses associated to accumulation of senescent cells, termed inflammaging, have
been identified in both situations [18-20]. In experimental models of murine coronavirus
infection, biological aging induced by telomeric disfunction, is associated with lethality
and higher cytokine responses [21]. In our cohorts, additional differences between
rheumatic, including AI/IMID group, and control patients in the expression of COVID-19
disease were not detected. Despite the pro-inflammatory background of AI/IMID
patients, the biological response to the infection was similar to that of controls. This
suggests that the severity is not necessarily related to quantitative differences in the
cytokine (i.e. IL6/CRP) response and additional factors should be searched for.
In conclusion, we found that, among patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases,
having an AI/IMID, aging, and male sex pose a significantly greater risk for poor
outcomes, whereas active immunosuppressor therapies do not. This observation
should help to tailor prevention measures in specific diagnostic and therapeutic groups
of rheumatic patients during this or future coronavirus pandemics.
