Abstract

19

In COVID-19, transfer of respiratory materials transmits disease but the interplay of droplet and aerosol

20

physics, physiology and environment is not fully understood. To advance understanding of disease

21

transmission mechanisms and to find novel exposure minimization strategies, we studied cough-driven

22

material transport modes and the efficacy of control strategies.

23

Design and methods:

24

Computer simulations and real-world experiments were used for integrating an intensive care setting, multi-

25

physics, and physiology. Patient-focused airflow management and air purification strategies were examined

26

computationally and validated by submicron particle exhalation imaging in volunteers.

27

Results

28

Respiratory materials ejected by cough exhibited four transport modes: long-distance ballistic, short-

29

distance ballistic, “jet rider”, and aerosol modes. Interaction with air conditioning driven flow contaminated

30

a hospital room rapidly. Different than large droplets or aerosols, “jet rider” droplets travelled with the

31

turbulent air jet initially, but fell out at a distance, were not well eliminated by air conditioning and exposed

32

bystanders at larger distance and longer time; their size predisposes them to preferential capture in the

33

nasal mucosa, the primordial COVID-19 infection site. “Cough shields” captured large droplets but induced

34

lateral dispersion of aerosols and jet riders. An air purification device alone had limited efficacy. A “Shield

35

and Sink” approach combining “cough shields” with “virus sinks” miminized exposure to all secretions in

36

modeling and real-life experiments.

37

Conclusions

38

“Jet riders” have characteristics of highly efficient respiratory infection vectors and may play a role in Covid-

39

19 transmission. Exposure to all droplet types can be minimized through an easily implemented “Shield and

40

Sink” strategy.

Introduction

62

Role of droplets and aerosols in Coronavirus transmission

63

Droplet transmission from coughing or sneezing is considered the dominant mode in COVID-19 but current

64

evidence also suggests a role of aerosol-mediated virus transmission1,2 rendering understanding and control

65

of emitted respiratory materials of all sizes desirable. Arguments for a role of aerosols include transmission

66

by asymptomatic persons3,4,5, epidemiologic observations in SARS-CoV-26,7,8, air sample analysis9,10 in SARS-

67

SARS-COV-211 and SARS-COV-112, and general observations in virus and bacterial aerosol transmission13,14,15.

68

Controling aerosol transmission may be an adjunct to avoiding droplet transmission for COVID control16,17, as

69

recently emphasized by many experts18.

70

Expiratory droplets, aerosols and submicron particles: Physiological origin, physical aspects, room

71

distribution and persistence

72

Droplets of various sizes are produced when air moves across wet respiratory surfaces during respiring,

73

coughing, sneezing, talking or singing. Droplet number and size mix depend on activity and will influence

74

weight and infectious agent content; also, droplet motion19 is size-dependent, ranging from ballistic transfer

75

to slip flow to free molecular flow. The multiphase air jets in coughing or sneezing contain various droplet

76

sizes; in small droplets termed aerosols, aerodynamic drag dominates gravity, such that they tend to travel

77

with the air rather than to falling to the ground; in contrast, larger droplets move ballistically due to larger

78

mass and stronger gravitational impact and may transition to aerosols upon water evaporation.

79

Understanding droplet and aerosol mediated disease transmission therefore needs consideration of

80

production, initial acceleration, droplet/aerosol characteristics and behavior of the environment like air

81

motion.

82

Real-life imaging of droplets and aerosols produced by coughing and respiration is possible20,21,22,23, but

83

methods have practical limitations. E-cigarette smoke has submicron particle size comparable to respiratory

84

aerosol subpopulations24,25 and is accessible to imaging, so that E-cigarette smoke tracking might enhance

85

understanding aerosol clouds and allow validating theoretical predictions.

86

Source control and personal protective equipment

87

The current emphasis in Covid-19 transmission control is on social distancing, testing, isolation of affected

88

individuals and their contacts, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE like masks and gowns

89

confer significant protection, but the relevance asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission and the

90

phenomenon of super spreaders calls would call for broad use of PPEs, and if not worn to the full extent,

91

may lead to partial protection only. Improved source control might contribute to transmission risk reduction

92

particularly in settings where widespread use of full PPE is not feasible.

93

Aim of the study

94

We aimed at in-depth understanding of transmission of potentially infectious secretions from coughing

95

persons to their environment in a hospital context, based on cough physiology, real-life room architecture

96

and air conditioning. Using computational and real-life experiments, we further aimed at developing

97

effective source control measures that minimize transfer of such materials and may thus minimize indoor

98

COVID-19 transmission risk.

99

Methods

100

Methods include modeling of room architecture, air flow and cough physiology combined with real-world

101

experiments in a hospital setting.

102

Hospital rooms involved in COVID-19 patient care in the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, were

103

recreated as volumetric digital models, equipped with patient beds, monitors, desks, air conditioning

104

system, cough shields and air sinks.

105

Air flow modeling

106

A computational multi-physics model was based on room geometry and standard fluid dynamics modeling of

107

air flow, based on the hydrodynamic principles described by Bernoulli at our university in 173826, formalized

108

as Navier-Stokes equations and implemented as an open source computer library, as described in the

109

supplemental material. Modeling included pressure, flow, aerosol content, temperature and buoyancy.

110

Room ventilation was parameterized according to the existing air conditioning system, with settings ranging

111

from minimum regulatory recommendations for ICU rooms [> 40 m3/h/person + 100 m3/h/patient27,28] up to

112

10 room air exchanges per hour for a given room. Patient airflow was modeled as air emanating from the

113

mouth of a patient in a semi-recumbent bed position (i.e., cough jet direction upwards with 30° forward tilt)

114

and optional lateral head rotation. Normal respiration and biphasic flow patterns29 for cough were modeled,

115

with ”exhalation”, “weak cough” and “strong cough” modeled as peak airflow velocities of 1.5m/s, 10m/s

116

and 20m/s, respectively. A “breathable zone” (typical caregiver head location), was defined from 1/3 to 2/3

117

of room height, with particle density in this zone as surrogate for caregiver exposure, while particles sticking

118

to surfaces or floating near the floor or the ceiling were considered “not breathable”.

119

Droplet and aerosol modeling

120

Modeling of droplet and aerosol distribution and dynamics was done in two complementary ways: particle

121

modeling and diffusion modeling.

122

In particle modeling, individual droplets and aerosols were modeled as spheres moving in the air flow that

123

was modeled by fluid dynamics. Physical particle modeling included starting point, ejection velocity at mouth

124

level, ejection angle, aerodynamic drag exerted by the surrounding moving air, including gravitation, random

125

effects and Brownian motion. Droplets were generated in numbers proportional to orifice velocity, in size

126

clusters with mean diameters of 1mm, 100µm, 10µm, 1µm and 0.1µm +/- 20%, corresponding to observed

127

droplet sizes in cough30 and sneezes, down the size of a single virus particle. Terminal velocity for each

128

droplet due to gravity was determined as a function of the Reynolds number. Dynamics for each droplet

129

within the fluid dynamics field were modeled, using both, separate runs for each size cluster as well as

130

combined runs to understand differential distribution and fate of droplets. Droplet impact on surfaces led to

131

sticking of the particle to said surface. Droplets sticking to a surface or exiting the room through exhaust

132

pipes or door were counted.

133

In a convection/diffusion model, complementary to the particle analysis, air contamination by aerosols was

134

modeled as continuous diffusion model, with origin of the solute at the mouth, using particle size to

135

compute the diffusion coefficient. Modeling details are given in the supplement.

136

“Virus Shield and Sink”

137

Virus shields consisted of bed-mountable transparent polycarbonate plates of size 45cm*35cm to

138

60cm*60cm, with their corresponding digital model, positioned in front of the patient’s head and angulated

139

such that the dominant cough direction hits the shield approximately in right angle. A ”Virus sink” consisted

140

of a commercial air purifier device (Toom Model 30W, REWE Zentral AG, Köln, Germany) having an air inlet

141

diameter of 32cm, a HEPA filter, was capable of purifying up to 350m3/h, and its corresponding digital

142

model, having H13 Hepa filter characteristics, positioned at the cranial bed end, with the air inlet near the

143

patient head.

144

Real-life imaging of submicron particle distribution on coughing

145

Two habitual E-cigarette smokers were positioned in an ICU bed in the modeled room, instructed to inhale

146

the smoke of their E-cigarette and then to voluntarily cough with moderate strength, and were filmed for

147

digital submicron particle imaging without and with the “Shield and Sink” equipment in different

148

combinations.

149

Patient and public involvement

150

The study was triggered by discussions between physicians and ICU nurses on strategies to minimize in-

151

hospital virus transmission during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

152

Ethics

153

The responsible Ethics Commission Northwest and Central Switzerland EKNZ (Req-2020-01362) ruled that

154

the study is a not clinical study and does not require Ethical Committee permission. The persons visualized in

155

figures and supplements gave written informed consent for participation and consented to their images and

156

videos being published for scientific purposes.

Results

162

Modeling: Room geometry and ventilation (Figure 1)

163

Room geometry, room installation and air flow due to the air conditioning system (A/C) using standard A/C

164

settings are shown in figure 1. A downdraft near the patient’s leg location from the A/C inflow to the outlet

165

vents near the door drives a horizontal air motion component even in stationary flow conditions. Flow was

166

almost stationary (compatible with the Reynolds number ~2000) in standard A/C settings but changed to an

167

oscillating pattern with increased turbulence (Reynolds number ~5000) at 10 air exchanges per hour.

168

Distribution of ejected droplets and aerosols in modeling (Figure 2)

169

Four characteristic dynamic behaviors were documented: In the first seconds of a cough, ballistic ejection of

170

1mm droplets up to 4 and 6 m distance during moderate and strong coughs was observed in the particle

171

model, capable to reach the contralateral wall, nurse workplaces and adjacent beds, depending on head

172

rotation. Notably, the upward/forward direction of the cough jet due to the semi-recumbent position

173

essentially doubled the reach of ballistic droplets compared to a horizontal jet direction. Droplets in the

174

0.1mm size range started ballistically but were quickly slowed down by aerodynamic drag and, attracted by

175

gravity, fell down within 1 m around the patient head, such that after the first 3 seconds, most droplets from

176

1 to 0.1mm had hit a surface and were no longer in the air. Droplets in the 10µm size range behaved

177

differently: due to the small size and a high drag/gravity force ratio, they travelled with the air jet for several

178

meters before falling out due to gravity from the slowed down air convection; distance traveled by these

179

droplets even surpassed most large ballistic droplets; they were the main population sprayed on a neighbor

180

bed in a specific setting. A fourth population, the droplets of size 1µm down to 0.1µm showed classical

181

aerosol behavior and travelled throughout with the air convection, not falling out at the studied range of

182

ventilation settings. Such aerosols followed complex trajectories within the room determined by A/C

183

induced air flow patterns, and depending on cough direction and ventilation settings, reached most room

184

locations within a few minutes, before being removed by exiting through the ventilation exhaust, sticking to

185

a wall, or, with the door opened, by leaving through the door to central ICU workplaces.

186

The convection-diffusion model yielded complementary results consistent with the aerosol particle modeling

187

and showed that within minutes, in most locations of the room (except downstream of the air conditioning

188

inlet), concentration of aerosols build up and are only slowly cleared (10-20min) by air conditioning, implying

189

that a higher cough frequency leads to accumulation of aerosols.

190

Exposition to various droplet fractions at “breathable locations” over time (Figure 3)

191

The time course of particles in the “breathable zone” of the room is shown in figure 3. Larger droplets were

192

quickly sprayed across space but hat all but disappeared from the air at 3 seconds, either sticking at walls,

193

floor or beds. Aerosols in the 0.1 to 1 micrometer range persisted for 20 minutes in significant proportion in

194

the breathable zone and showed recirculation, but due to their propensity to rise towards the ceiling

195

through the buoyancy of the warm exhaled air (where the air conditioning exhaust is located), exposition in

196

the breathable zone was lower than for “jet riders” (droplets in the 5-40 micrometer size range) that

197

dominated the breathable zone air up to 300 seconds and resulted in large exposition-time integrals, a

198

surrogate for exposure intensity.

199

Droplet and aerosol capture strategies in model: (Figure 4)

200

Virus shields positioned in front of the patient could captured all large droplets with trajectories suited to

201

reach distant locations. However, air jet splitting and redirection was observed with such shield, leading to

202

lateral aerosol plumes moving in direction of nurse workplaces and the adjacent patient bed.

203

A virus sink/air filtration device positioned near the patient’s head and driven at maximum performance was

204

neither capable to capture the larger droplets nor the majority of the aerosol produced, because the jet

205

emanating from the mouth was sufficiently fast and strong to overcome the small flow velocity field

206

produced by the device.

207

In the novel Shield & Sink strategy, a shield and a sink were combined based on parameters identified in

208

modeling. Modeling showed that at sufficient sink air flows, the shield bends the streamlines of the cough air

209

flow such to keep the aerosol plume in proximity to the sink device, so that it can be quantitatively captured

210

and filtered by the device. Stepping up from a H13 to a higher performant H14 Hepa filter had a negligible

211

additional effect on the results, but higher cough jet velocities increased the proportion of “escaping”

212

aerosol while higher air sink velocity decreased it (data not shown). The added value of air disinfection

213

strategies, e.g. by ultraviolet light was not examined but the results suggest that its potential for incremental

214

benefit to “Shield & Sink” is small.

215

Droplet and aerosol capture strategies in real-life scenario (Figure 5)

216

Assessing the behavior of exhaled sub-micrometer particles by digital submicron particle imaging of ejected

217

E-cigarette smoke confirmed computational predictions: Coughing rapidly produced a large particle plume,

218

discernibly by eye up to 2 meters in the first seconds, followed by slow further movement. Installing a shield

219

in front of the face led to jet splitting and redirection. Using an air filtration device near the patient’s head

220

was incapable to quantitatively remove the aerosol. However, in the “Shield and Sink” strategy, the shield

221

slowed the aerosol jet such that the plume was aspirated and filtered to a visually full degree by the sink

222

device. The video clips in the supporting material show the performance of droplet and aerosol capture

223

strategies in modelled and real-life scenarios.

224

Discussion

225

In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this study analyses the spread of potentially infectious

226

materials produced by respiratory events like coughing and examines the value of source-control measures

227

for avoiding droplet- and aerosol transmission of respiratory materials to bystanders during hospital care of

228

patients. It quantitatively analyzes distribution, recirculation and out-of-room transfer of droplets and

229

aerosol produced by coughing and breathing through computational modeling of patient activity, room

230

architecture and air conditioning and validates the findings by exhaled particle cloud imaging. Extending

231

prior knowledge, it describes four different and potentially medically relevant modes of droplet transport: 1)

232

dominant ballistic (long distance fallout) 2) ballistic-drag (short distance fallout), 3) floating-gravity

233

dominated (longest distance fallout), and 4) fully floating (no fallout) .

234

The novel “Shield and Sink” approach introduced here is a patient-centered strategy to transmission

235

avoidance by creating per-patient aerodynamic settings, an approach that proves highly effective and

236

achieves near-complete elimination of droplets and aerosol of all classes near the patient head in modeling

237

and real-world experiments, suggesting a potential for strongly reducing exposure of care persons and

238

nearby patients.

239

The quest for source control measures to stop infection propagation

240

In view of the persistence31 of SARS-CoV2 in aerosols with an estimated half-life of 60min, personal

241

protective equipment (PPE) for minimizing droplet and aerosol inhalation is widely used in direct COVID

242

patient care. However, the occurrence of asymptomatic carriers and super-spreaders renders each untested

243

patient entering a hospital a potential source of infection. Rapid testing of each patient and use of full PPE

244

for each untested individual may not be realistic and economically feasible in all settings at a global scale,

245

raising the question if, and to what degree, suited source-control measures could prevent transmission of

246

infectious material to caregivers, other patients and other bystanders.

247

Determinants of droplet and aerosol propagation

248

We found that the spread of potentially infectious material from the airways to the environment is highly

249

variable and determined by patient characteristics (coughing strength, head position), droplet size, room

250

geometry and ventilation conditions. Even in ventilation conditions fulfilling current hospital architecture

251

norms, droplet spread reached neighbor patients and nurse workplaces; prolonged aerosol circulation was

252

observed, but increasing ventilation settings was found to potentially increasing room air turbulence, i.e.

253

undesired air mixing.

254

For droplets in the 1 millimeter range, we observed ballistic transfer up to 5-6 meters in strong and 4 m in

255

moderate strength cough jets. The longer reach of droplets compared to the historical 1-2 m rule for droplet

256

transmission has several reasons: First, in ICU and hospital room patients, the frequently used semi-

257

recumbent position32 with head elevation ≥30° directs the cough jet obliquely upwards and thereby

258

maximizes a ballistic trajectory; also, such droplets initially travel with the air jet (i.e., less drag), benefit from

upward buoyancy of the warm expired air, and dry up slower due to the expired air humidity, enabling them

260

to reach farther than an isolated water droplet horizontally emitted into non-moving dry air. Droplets in the

261

0.1 mm diameter range also behaved ballistically, but their smaller kinetic energy led to quick slowdown by

262

drag as soon as they left the cough air jet, and being pulled down by gravity, their reach was limited to

263

approximately 1m around the head. Typical aerosol behavior (traveling with the surrounding air, flowing

264

around obstacles) was observed for droplets starting at the 1 µm down to the 0.1 µm ranges, consistent with

265

literature; the negligible impact of gravity on such very small droplet combined with the higher temperature

266

of the exhaled air explained their tendency to rise towards the ceiling and being eliminated through the air

267

conditioning exhaust. “Jet rider” droplets, smaller than ballistic droplets but larger than classical aerosols,

268

appeared to have particular importance:

269
270

“Jet Riders” with distant fallout

271

Notably, the size fraction of droplets in the 10-20 (or 5-40) µm range displayed a behavior that does neither

272

fit in the “ballistic” nor in the “aerosol-type” patterns: While it travels in the early, fast, warm, turbulent and

273

buoyant air jet like an aerosol, the gravitational pull becomes dominant in the slower moving air with less

274

turbulence, leading to gravitational fallout at a distance, thereby spraying objects like a neighbor patient bed

275

or nurse workplaces, reaching on average even further than the large ballistic droplets, a finding that may be

276

highly relevant because smaller droplets carry a significant amount of infectiosity33,34. Unfortunately, this is

277

also the particle size range where the nose, the primordial location of SARS-CoV-2 infection, catches particles

278

highly effectively35.

279

While classical fluid dynamics, aerodynamics and droplet physics are well established scientific fields, it

280

appears thus that in the complexities encountered in the interaction of human pathophysiology, viral

281

spread, droplet physics and room air conditioning, some important and interesting phenomena are not yet

282

fully explored, appear relevant for human health and thus merit further in-depth study that may contribute

283

to solving urgent societal problems.

284

Hospital air conditioning

285

Air flow induced by A/C was an important driver of aerosol transmission to adjacent patients and nurse

286

working locations and recirculation of contaminated air. Doors also played a role: typically, only a small

287

minority of hospital rooms is equipped for negative pressure settings but default ventilation in our

288

institution in patient rooms, builds up a slight positive pressure; when patient room doors remain open or

289

are opened as needed for patient care, transfer of aerosols to the central nurse workplace occurred (data

290

not shown). Increasing air flow rate from rates on one side led to more aerosols leaving the room per time

291

interval, but on the other side induced more turbulent room air flow at the given geometry, favoring air

292

mixing and thus potentially transporting aerosol-loaded air from non-breathing zones towards breathing

293

zones; therefore, the benefit of just increasing ventilation thus has limitations that depend on the specific

294

characteristics of a room and A/C system.

295

Cough shields

296

Cough “shields” were partly effective in stopping forward-directed cough droplets but led to a redirection of

297

the air stream carrying aerosols, including in the direction of adjacent beds and nurse workplaces at the side

298

of the patient bed, an effect which is not desired. Also, air flow around obstacles is a well-known physical

299

phenomenon36 that limits the effectiveness of such shields for aerosol plumes.

300

Air filtering

301

Air purification by filtering with a high flow, HEPA filter equipped commercially available air filtering device,

302

was examined. We found in modeling as well as in real-world experiments (E-cigarette smoke distribution)

303

that such an air filtering device alone, even when positioned near the patient head, only has a limited

304

capabililty for directly and quantitatively removing droplets/aerosols from the cough jet because the jet

305

velocities away from the device were sufficiently high to overcome the modest pressure/velocity gradient

306

produced by the device. Non patient centered air filtering has been shown to contribute to reduction of

307

overall aerosol load in recirculating contaminated room air37, but in such that setting, an aerosol

308

concentration half-time in the range of 6-12 minutes was found, similar to the aerosol removal in our

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20233056; this version posted December 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this

309

context by standard A/C. In such devices, quantitative aerosol removal is dominated by air flow, directing

310

flow towards the filter, rather than Hepa filter class (H13: 99.95%; H14: 99.995% particle removal efficacy).

311

“Virus shield and sink” – a novel, effective, per-patient airflow handling approach

312

To achieve near-complete elimination of droplets and aerosols of all sizes from 1mm down to 0.1micrometer

313

from the cough jet and expired air, a novel per-patient airflow handling approach was designed, inspired by

314

the findings above, and was validated in a real-life scenario.

315

Such a per-patient airflow management includes capturing large, ballistic, forward directed droplets by a

316

shield that at the same time works as a jet redirector, limiting the forward velocity of the air jet and

317

redirecting the aerosol plume in a way that it is amenable to being captured by a “virus sink”, a strategically

318

placed aur filtering device behind the patient’s head driven at velocities tailored to bend the streamlines of

319

the aerosol jet towards the device and quantitatively filter the aerosol. This setup was capable to capture

320

cough-related respiratory materials from millimeter-sized droplets down to submicron particles in a

321

quantitative fashion.

322

E-cigarette smoke test as simple surrogate test for source control measures

323

The efficacy a specific “Shield and Sink” setup tailored to a specific location and filter device that may differ

324

in geometry and air flow capacity from the one described here is a amenable to simple qualitative function

325

testing by the E-cigarette smoke test described here, thus representing a real-world quality control and

326

training tool.

327

Limitations

328

Clinical proof of infection reduction by preventive measures will require large-scale clinical trials that cannot

329

easily be blinded. In the ongoing COVID pandemic, time available for such trials is limited, and clinical trial

330

evidence for most prevention activities will remain sparse. As the approach proposed here is non-invasive, is

331

associated with limited expense, and the current study focuses on a plausible surrogate marker, namely

332

spread of various-sized materials produced by coughing, such a strategy may be clinically introduced with

333

little delay, yielding a safe time window to further in-depth study of the still controversial role of aerosols in

336

Importance

337

The novel “Virus Shield and Sink” approach for source control of droplets, “jet riders” and aerosols emitted

338

by coughing patients permits significant reduction of the transfer of such potentially infectious materials in a

339

hospital setting. As a rapidly and inexpensively implementable infrastructural measure, it has the potential

340

of contributing to mitigation and control of the COVID pandemic.

Supplemental material
Architectural Modeling
Architecture modeling was done within a multiphysics environment (“A2” Framework, “Matrix” library
developed in a joint project of the University of Basel and ETH Zurich) by creating a 3D vector geometry
model using the software module “VolumeRaytracer”). Regular multiresolution finite difference grids from
size 512x256x256 down to 32x16x16 were then overlaid on the volume data for modeling.
Fluid dynamics modeling
The fluid dynamics model was based on the same multiphysics framework, module “VolumeNavierStokes”
and was typically run on the 256x128x128 grid, with a 16-fold oversampling for particle displays. Fluid
dynamics used a Backward Time Centered Space approach and modeled fluid advection, diffusion and
divergence using a standard operator splitting approach under the assumption of noncompressibility, also
incorporating solute injection at the mouth orifice, solute diffusion as well as heat transfer (orifice exit
temperature 37°C) and buoyancy. Aerosol production (modeled in this part as solute injection) was
proportional to orifice exit velocity. Diffusion coefficients for spheres of 10um, 1um and 0.1um were 3.0E-8,
3.0E-7 and 3.0E-6 , respectively. Adaptive time stepping was used to limit fluid advection within a step to at
most one grid element, resulting in time steps down to 2ms. Measurement probe volumes could be placed
within the model to monitor the changes of a local parameter over time. An overall Reynolds number as
predictor of turbulent flow conditions was estimated using the room extents and the overall flow, although
precise, local Reynolds number in such complicated geometries cannot easily be determined.
Particle modeling
Particle modeling was done using the same framework, with an object-oriented modeling of each particle in
a manner allowing overlay of the particles on the fluid dynamics framework. Specifically, individual droplets
and aerosols were considered as spheres with the density of water moving in the air flow that was modeled
by fluid dynamics. Physical effects in sphere modeling included ejection velocity at mouth air speed,
aerodynamic drag exerted by the surrounding air, gravitational force, and Brownian motion, each including
some random variation. Droplets originated at random positions within the orifice, were generated in
numbers proportional to the orifice velocity, in size clusters with mean diameters of 1mm, 100µm, 10µm,
1µm and 0.1µm +/- 20%, corresponding to observed droplet sizes in cough and sneezes down the size of a
single virus particle. Initial velocity corresponded to the fluid dynamics velocity field with added Gaussian
noise (sigma=25%) to velocity vector components. Drag and terminal velocity for each droplet was
determined based on the drag equation, switching to the terminal velocity creeping flow solution38 when
Reynolds number was <1. Dynamics for each droplet were modeled, in separate runs for each size cluster
and in combined runs to understand differential distribution and fate of droplets. Droplet impact on surfaces
led to sticking of the particle to said surface. Droplets sticking to a surface or exiting the room through
exhaust pipes or door were counted as inhalable in the exposure statistics.
Cough physiology modeling
The airflow model was similar to the one described in PLOS. In short, on coughing an air jet exited from an
orifice (area 5cm2), with a temporal cough flow profile modeled as two-phase event with a first, stronger but
short (peak at 0.25 sec) air emission, overlapping with a somewhat longer (peak at 0.5 sec) but less strong
air emission, whereby each component was modeled as a cropped (zero to pi) sinus wave, parameterized
such that for “strong cough”, “moderate cough” and “normal exhalation” mouth orifice peak velocities
approximated 20m/s, 10m/s, and 2.5m/s, respectively.

Video clips were produced that show the time course of material dispersion after a cough: in modelled video
clips the first three seconds in first 3 seconds in realtime, followed by or a 5-minute time window by in timelapse. In real-life video clips, the first few seconds after a cough are shown.
Submicron particle exhalation imaging
Submicron particle exhalation imaging was achieved by first filming a particle exhaust plume originating
from exhaled E-cigarette smoke with a stationary iPhone 6s camera under strong back-lighting illumination
conditions in a darkened room, followed by digital subtraction image processing whereby the initial frame is
subtracted digitally from subsequent frames (custom software setup, including ImageJ software39).
