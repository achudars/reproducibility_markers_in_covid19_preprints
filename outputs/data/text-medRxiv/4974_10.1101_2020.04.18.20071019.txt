ABATRACT
IMPORTANCE
In the epidemic, surgeons cannot distinguish infectious acute abdomen
patients suspected COVID-19 quickly and effectively.
OBJECTIVE
To develop and validate a predication model, presented as nomogram and
scale, to distinguish infectious acute abdomen patients suspected coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).
DESIGN
Diagnostic model based on retrospective case series.
SETTING
Two hospitals in Wuhan and Beijing, China.
PTRTICIPANTS
584 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from
2 Jan 2020 to15 Feb 2020 and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients
receiving emergency operation from 28 Feb 2019 to 3 Apr 2020.

LASSO regression and multivariable logistic regression analysis were
conducted to develop the prediction model in training cohort. The performance
of the nomogram was evaluated by calibration curves, receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact
curves in training and validation cohort. A simplified screening scale and
managing algorithm was generated according to the nomogram.
RESULTS
Six potential COVID-19 prediction variables were selected and the variable
abdominal pain was excluded for overmuch weight. The five potential
predictors, including fever, chest computed tomography (CT), leukocytes
(white blood cells, WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT),
were all independent predictors in multivariable logistic regression analysis
(p≤0.001) and the nomogram, named COVID-19 Infectious Acute Abdomen
Distinguishment (CIAAD) nomogram, was generated. The CIAAD nomogram
showed good discrimination and calibration (C-index of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.963
to 0.999) and AUC of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982)), which was validated in
the validation cohort (C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972) and AUC of
0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.975)). Decision curve analysis revealed that the
CIAAD nomogram was clinically useful. The nomogram was further simplified
into the CIAAD scale.
CONCLUSIONS
We established an easy and effective screening model and scale for surgeons

Introduction
Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China,
which has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization on Mar 11, 2020, the cunning virus has drastically spread all over
the world1, 2. Millions of people have been infected, resulting in tens of
thousands died3. The still ongoing pandemic is not only a huge threat to the
public physical health but also an acid test for the medical system regardless
of developed counties or developing countries4. In addition to prevention, quick
and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is one of the most important tasks
currently.
The medical management of other diseases has been critically disturbed,
especially for some with fever, the typical symptom of COVID-195. There are
numerous high-risk people in close contact with the confirmed patients. As we
all know, interdicting transmission is the most effective way to control the
epidemic of COVID-19. Under current situation for surgeons, infectious acute
abdomen is still one of the most common surgery emergencies, the patients of
which often have fever, diarrhea and other atypical symptom, and also have
similar change of blood routine and other biochemistry items with COVID-19
for infectious or chemical peritonitis6. Hence, when surgeons managing
patients of infectious acute abdomen, the typical symptoms and blood test
indicators of COVID-19 are easy to be covered up. Currently, diagnosis of
COVID-19 mainly depends on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection7. However, the approach has defects of
time-consuming and false-negative results8, which go against the urgency of
emergency operation and the aim to avoid cross infection in the hospital, and
therefore, there is a pressing need of an easier and more feasible method to
distinguish the genuine COVID-19 patients among the infectious acute
abdomen patients with mimical symptoms.
Based on the clinical data of 822 patients, 584 of COVID-19 and 238 of
infectious acute abdomen, we compared the demographic, clinical, imaging
and laboratory characteristics to obtain significant predictors of COVID-19.
Further, a prediction model to distinguish the two diseases was generated
based on machine learning and presented in form of nomogram, which has a
good discrimination performance in both training and validation cohort.
Ultimately, we offered a practical screening scale, named CIAAD scale, and an
algorithm, including precaution advice for surgeons, in infectious acute
abdomen patients encounters.

Methods
Patients
Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committees of Peking Union
Medical College Hospital and the Central Hospital of Wuhan for this
retrospective stud. We brought 584 COVID-19 patients adopted into the
Central Hospital of Wuhan between Jan 2, 2020 and Feb 15, 2020 into our

study, the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 were positive RT-PCR results for
SARS-CoV-2 or highly homologous viral gene sequencing results with
SARS-CoV-2 of respiratory or blood samples7. Since the routine medical order
of other diseases in Wuhan were severely disturbed by the epidemic, the
clinical data of infectious acute abdomen patients were collected from 283
patients receiving emergency operation in Peking Union Medical College
Hospital between Feb 28, 2019 and Apr 3, 2020. The inclusion criteria were: (1)
fever; or (2) abnormal blood routine results or other infection indicators; or (3)
signs of pneumonia. The patients with infectious acute abdomen adopted after
Jan 20, 2020 were all tested for SARS-CoV-2 and none of them was positive.
Data Collection and definitions
Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data of the
COVID-19 and infectious acute abdomen patients were extracted from
electronic medical system of the Central Hospital of Wuhan and Peking Union
Medical College Hospital respectively.
Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37.3℃. The chest CT
scores were graded retrospectively by two radiologists back to back. Each
lung is divided into the upper, middle and lower parts and the scoring criterion
is ＜1/3 lung infected, 0 point; 1/3-2/3 lung infected, 1 point; ＞2/3 lung
infected, 2 points. The definition of COVID-19 severity was based on the
Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 7.0) published by the
National Health Commission of China7.

Potential predictors selection
The primary cohort of the whole 822 patients was divided into a training cohort
and a validation cohort randomly by ratio of 2:1. The least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator (LASSO) method, one of the most effective ones in
regularized regression with great advantage when managing multicolinearity
data, was used to select the most useful predictive variables for COVID-19 in
the training cohort9.
Development and validation of a prediction model
We conduct multivariate logistic regression involving the potential predictors to
further verify their predictive efficacy and build a nomogram to distinguish
COVID-19 patients from infectious acute abdomen patients on the basis of
multivariable logistic analysis in the training cohort. We named the nomogram
as COVID-19 and Infectious Acute Abdomen Distinguishment (CIAAD)
nomogram. Calibration curves were plotted to assess the calibration of the
CIAAD nomogram and C-index was measured to quantify its discrimination
performance. Then, CIAAD nomogram the training cohort was applied to the
patients in the validation cohort and the calibration curve and C-index were
derived on the basis of the regression analysis. The distinguishment capacity
of CIAAD nomogram in both training and validation cohorts were also
accessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC).
Clinical Usefulness Assessment

Decision curve analysis and clinical impact curves was conducted to evaluate
the clinical practicability of CIAAD nomogram by quantifying the net benefits at
different threshold probabilities in both training and validation dataset.
Development of Screening Scale
The corresponding score of each item in CIAAD nomogram was divided by 25
and rounded to obtain a simplified score. The simplified score are verified to
have the same efficacy comparing the original nomogram. We subdivide the
risk of COVID-19 into low (＜0.3), moderate (0.3-0.7) and high (＞0.7) risk.
The CIAAD Scale was formed on basis of the simplified scoring criterion and
risk classification.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentage.
Continuous variables were expressed as medians with interquartile ranges.
Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to evaluate categorical
and continuous data respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted with R
software (version 3.6.1; http:// www.Rproject.org) and SPSS statistical
software package (version 25.0). P＜0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics
A total of 822 patients, 584 COVID-19 patients without infectious acute

abdomen and 238 infectious acute abdomen patients without COVID-19, were
included in this study (Table 1). Nearly 16% of the COVID-19 patients were
severe or critical (Figure 1). The disease spectrum of the infectious acute
abdomen patients was principally acute appendicitis (60.5%), perforation
(17.6%) and obstruction (13.4%). The infectious acute abdomen patients are
younger (P=.001) and combined with less chronic diseases, such as diabetes
(P=.005), cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (P=.011). Fever, as
reported before, was the most common symptom in the COVID-19 patients
(80.1%), which ranked second (32.4%) in the infectious acute abdomen
patients inferior to abdominal pain (99.2%). COVID-19 resulted in larger
infected occupancy of lung (P＜.001). Nevertheless, abdominal infection
caused by infectious acute abdomen rendered the laboratory testing results of
these patients, such as CRP, PCT, WBC, neutrophils and fibrinogen, more
abnormal (P＜.001).
Potential predictors selection
All collected 40 variables were reduced to 6 potential predictors (abdominal
pain, fever, chest CT, CRP, PCT and WBC) with nonzero coefficients in
LASSO regression on the basis of 547 patients in the training cohort (Figure 2).
It should be noted that 99.2% of the infectious acute abdomen patients had the
symptom of abdominal pain, the proportion of which in COVID-19 patients was
merely 0.2%, making it very likely to have overmuch weight in the model and
go against the distinguish efficacy (Table 1). Concerned above, abdominal

pain was excluded from the potential predictors. AUC of the left five variables,
fever, chest CT, CRP, PCT and WBC, was yielded respectively in the training
cohort and validation cohort (Figure S1 and S2).
Development of a prediction model
To simplify the model, the concrete values of CRP, PCT and WBC were
transformed into categorical variables (CRP and PCT: 1 for normal, 2 for high;
WBC: 1 for low, 2 for normal and 3 for high) and the symptom fever was also
defined as 0 for "no" and 1 for "yes". Multivariate logistic regression analysis
was performed among the five variables and all of these potential predictors
have great value in distinguishing COVID-19 from infectious acute abdomen
(Table 2). A risk score formula was preliminarily built to predict COVID-19
probability as follows: Logit (P = COVID-19) = 10.104 + 1.915×fever +
1.753×chest CT + (-2.508)×CRP + (-0.8)×PCT + (-1.836)×WBC. The CIAAD
nomogram was generated on basis of the above result (Figure 3A).
Performance of the nomogram in training and validation cohort
The calibration curve of CIAAD nomogram for the risk of COVID-19
demonstrated good agreement between prediction and reality in the training
cohort (Figure 3B). The C-index for the prediction nomogram was 0.981 (95%
CI, 0.963 to 0.999) for the training cohort. Good calibration was also observed
in the validation cohort with a C-index of 0.966 (95% CI, 0.960 to 0.972)
(Figure 3C). The ROC analysis for the training and validation cohort yielded
AUC values of 0.970 (95% CI, 0.961 to 0.982) and 0.966 (95% CI, 0.957 to

0.975), which implied the prediction performance was favorable (Figure 3D
and 2E).
Clinical Use and development of a simplified scale
Decision curve analysis and clinical impact curves was conducted for the
CIAAD nomogram in both training and validation cohort (Figure 4),
demonstrating high clinical net benefit nearly over the entire threshold
probability.
With the purpose of making our prediction model more concise and practical in
surgery emergency, we simplified the scoring criterion of the CIAAD
nomogram and create a brand new scale, named CIAAD scale (Figure 5). In
CIAAD scale, the lowest and highest score of this scale is 3.5 and 14.5. The
item with a higher corresponding score is more common in COVID-19 patients,
such as fever, abnormal chest CT, normal level of CRP and WBC. If the total
score of a patient is less than 5, he/she gets low risk (＜30%) of confirmed
COVID-19, and the risk rises to more than 70% as the total score reaches 7.

Discussion
With the global outbreak of COVID-19, the latest sum of infected patients has
exceeded 1.8 million, and humankind will face the threat all through the near
future2. Vast medical resource has been put into rolling back the virus resulting
in the treatment for many other diseases postponed. However, for surgeons
confronted with patients of infectious acute abdomen urgent for emergency

operation, it is necessary to accurately distinguish COVID-19 patients from the
ones with similar and misguiding symptoms in the shortest time. To prevent
cross-infection of medical staff, doctors , nurses and other patients in
outpatient clinic, wards and operating rooms should take high-level precaution
when managing COVID-19 highly suspected patients. Excessive precaution
would cause huge waste of precious medical resource. On the contrary,
negligence of necessary screening would fling medical staff into great risk of
infection. The current screening procedures, such as nucleicacid detection and
CT, have the defects of unsatisfactory accuracy and time-consuming.
Consequently, a more convenient, efficient, economical and effective
COVID-19 screening method is surgeons' desideratum. To our knowledge, this
study provided the first screening model and scale for surgeons to distinguish
infectious acute abdomen patients from suspected and high risk of COVID-19
patients in emergency department by retrospectively comparing demographic,
clinical and laboratory characteristics of the two groups of patients. The CIAAD
nomogram and scale has satisfying performance in prediction and great
potential to help medical institutions to resume routine medical work during the
epidemic.
Challenges and opportunities
Current reports of the COVID-19 cohorts show that respiratory symptoms,
such as fever, cough and dyspnea, are the main clinical manifestations10.
Nevertheless, the digestive symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.18.20071019; this version posted April 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

abdominal pain are gradually reported to be an early onset, which deserves
more attention11, 12. A meta-analysis revealed that nearly half of the patients
had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 in stool and another bioinformatics
analysis had provided probable theoretical basis for the digestive symptoms,
that angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was highly expressed in
esophagus, ileum and colon13, 14. The mixture of fever and some digestive
symptoms mimics the symptoms of infectious acute abdomen to a great extent.
Similarly, if the patient is elder or the abdominal infection develops into
systemic infection, signs of pneumonia will emerge in infectious acute
abdomen patients as well. For infectious acute abdomen, increased morbidity
and mortality associated with a delay in the treatment of many of the surgical
causes argue for an aggressive and expeditious surgical approach15. In the
epidemic, quick and accurate screening in infectious acute abdomen patients
suspected of COVID-19 is vitally important.
The definite diagnosis of COVID-19 is still mainly depends on a positive
RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-216, which has the shortage of possibility of
false-negative caused by various reasons, such as disease stage, virus load
and sample quality. In our COVID-19 cohort, the positive rate at the first time of
nucleicacid detection is merely 43.7% (255/584). Meanwhile, chest CT was
also considered as a good tool to screen. However, mild patients without
pneumonia, atypical imaging findings and great dependence on physicians'
experience limit the screening value of chest CT. A study enrolled in 1014

COVID-19 cases from Wuhan showed that the positive rate for chest CT was
88%, comparing the 59% of RT-PCR8. Several prediction models based on the
integration of demographic, clinical, imaging and laboratory variables have
been developed to evaluate the disease risk or prognosis17. Unfortunately, the
target population of published diagnostic models was patients presenting at
fever clinic or ordinary patients suspected COVID-1917. It is not suitable for
surgeons to borrow these models directly to screen infectious acute abdomen
patients and our CIAAD nomogram and scale make up the pity.
Strengths and limitations of this study
The set of our model has the superiority of strong pertinence. The
recommended user of CIAAD scale is surgeon in the emergency department
and the recommended assessed population is infectious acute abdomen
patients suspected COVID-19. To this end, we collected firsthand and
high-quality data of COVID-19 patients and enrolled infectious acute abdomen
patients strictly. In addition, by virtue of LASSO regression analysis, five
quantifiable indicators were successfully selected. Though many variables like
diabetes, cough and D-dimer varied considerably between COVID-19 and
infectious acute abdomen patients, they were ruled out by LASSO regression
analysis as overmuch weight or causing the prediction model cumbersome.
The selected indictors were all included in previous prediction models, which
verified the prediction capacity of these variables from the side17.

Whereas, there is some inadequacy in our study as well. Firstly, the
disturbance for routine medical work by the epidemic resulted in the
appropriate lack of patients with both COVID-19 and acute abdomen. As the
number of emergency operations of acute abdomen decreased sharply in
Wuhan, the data of acute abdomen patients was from Peking Union Medical
College Hospital, a renowned and leader hospital in China.
Implications for practice and future
An algorithm helpful for allowing both a focused workup and expeditious
therapy was given, including necessary prevention advice for medical staff
with the guidelines published by World Health Organization for reference18
(Figure 6). What needs to be pointed out is that standard precautions are
needed for all patients. For an infectious acute abdomen patient suspected
COVID-19, the first step is to evaluate his/her surgical status and screen the
patient by CIAAD scale. The urgency degree of surgical status determines
whether the medical staff wait for the results of nucleicacid detection or take
precautions according to our algorithm. Level of precautions adopted should
be instructed by the risk degree of COVID-19 from CIAAD scale.
As the scale is harmless and the has net benefit nearly over the entire
threshold probability according to the decision analysis curves, strong
recommendation of our CIAAD scale and the algorithm was made to all
surgeons in countries severely affected by the epidemic. With the wide use in
lager population, efficacy of CIAAD scale will be further tested in a prospective

way.

Conclusion
With the aim of distinguishing COVID-19 patients from infectious acute
abdomen patients, we established an easy and effective screening model and
scale for surgeons in emergency department. The algorithm based on CIAAD
scale is promising to help surgeons manage infectious acute abdomen
patients suspected COVID-19 more efficiently avoiding cross infection as well
as guard health of medical staff.

Figure 3. The CIAAD nomogram and its discrimination performance in training
and validation cohort. (A). The CIAAD nomogram was developed in the
training cohort based on fever, chest CT, CRP, PCT and WBC. (B). Calibration
curve of CIAAD nomogram in the training cohort. Calibration curves depict the
calibration of each model in terms of the agreement between the predicted
risks of COVID-19 and observed outcomes of confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19. The Y-axis represents the actual COVID-19 rate. The X-axis
represents the predicted COVID-19 risk. The diagonal dotted line represents a
perfect prediction by an ideal model. The black solid line represents the
performance of CIAAD nomogram, of which a closer fit to the diagonal dotted
line represents a better prediction. (C). Calibration curve of CIAAD nomogram
in the validation cohort. (D). ROC curve of CIAAD nomogram in the training
cohort. (E). ROC curve of CIAAD nomogram in the validation cohort.
