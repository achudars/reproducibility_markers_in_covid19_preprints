Abstract
The novel Coronavirus pathogen Covid-19 is a cause of concern across the world as the
human-to-human infection caused by it is spreading at a fast pace. The virus that f irs t
manif ested in W u h a n , China has travelled across continents. The increase in number of
deaths in Italy, Iran, USA, and other countries has alarmed both the developed and
developing countries. Scientists are working hard to develop a vaccine against the virus, but
until now no breakthrough has been achieved. India, the second most populated country in
the world, is working hard in all dimensions to stop the spread of community infection.
Health care facilities are being updated; medical and paramedical staffs are getting trained,
and many agencies are raising awareness on the issues related to this virus and its
transmission. The administration is leaving no stone unturned to prepare the country to
mitigate the adverse effects. However, as the number of infected patients, and those
getting cured is changing differently in different states everyday it is difficult to
predict the spread of the virus and its fate in Indian context. Different states have adopted
measures to stop the community spread. Considering the vast size of the country, the population
size and other socio-economic conditions of the states, a single uniform policy may not work to
contain the disease. In this paper, we discuss a predictive mathematical model that can give us
some idea of the fate of the virus, an indicative data and future projections to understand the
further course this pandemic can take. The data can be used by the health care agencies, the
Government Organizations and the Planning Commission to make suitable arrangements to

manage the health care system in the present scenario. The recommendations can be made,
and advisories prepared based on the predictive results that can be implemented at regional
levels.

Introduction
Viruses have been considered as inconsequential pathogens in humans for long in
comparison to plants. The mortality caused by viruses in humans has been very low
in comparison to other diseases such as Cancer, Cardio-vascular diseases and
Tuberculosis (CGHR Report, 2017). However, viruses have been reported to
exacerbate the symptoms and have more serious implications on human health
if a person is suffering from some auto-immune disorder, infectious disease and
has compromised immune system.
In India, for diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV and Cancer, the related mortality rate
is so high that researchers and funding agencies have under-estimated the implications
viral diseases can have on public health and socio-economic security. Funding agencies and
data scientists have overlooked flu and other human viral pathogens; and in the past years,
not much research is funded to work on drug designing or medical research in the field.
It is also clear from the recent trends that viral diseases are going to spread at fast pace and
many novel viruses will be unearthed in near future. Climate change and deforestation is
also causing surge in outbreak of viral epidemics. The changing climate is also responsible
for increase in number of vectors that accelerate the spread of pathogens (Khan et al., 2019).
In the last few years, WHO (World Health Organization) has been continuously
emphasizing that the fast-developing nations such as India should triple their expenditure on
health care to meet the SDG goals. The outbreak of the SARS-CoV- 2 has raised the
concerns for the Government of India, public policy makers and administration as the
pandemic has implication on almost all sectors and strata of the society. It is therefore
important to understand how the virus will fare in India and how efficiently the country can

handle it without causing severe damage to human population.
COVID Pandemic
The recent outbreak of the global pandemic Covid-19 has changed the perspective of
everyone in the country regarding the viral disease outbreaks as it is affecting and infecting
humans around in an exponential manner. This viral disease as well as the causative agent is
novel entry to the viral world and hence is posing unforeseen challenges. SARS-Cov-2,
commonly known as N o v e l Coronavirus, is a single, positive-stranded, RNA virus
belonging to order Nidovirales (Cascella, 2020), responsible for the Current Global Pandemic
Covid-19 (Huang et al, 2020). Corona viruses show enormous diversity and are evolving
fast. Some of the other viruses related to this family of Coronavirus are SARS-CoV,
responsible for SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) and
MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) (Peeri, et al., 2020). Both these viruses
emerged from animal reservoirs to cause global epidemics with alarming morbidity and
mortality (Chavang, 2007). The reservoirs of the Novel Coronavirus are mostly animals
found in the wild. Scientists also believe that peri-domestic mammals may also serve as
intermediate hosts (Malik et al, 2020; Mudrich et al., 2020). Besides, many spontaneous
mutations that keep on happening in nature are facilitating expansion of genetic diversity
(He et al., 2020). There is strong e v i d e n c e that human-animal contact at live game
markets plays a role and thus there is zoonotic transmission of the virus (Li et al., 2020).
For long, human viruses have not been considered severe pathogens as infected people
develop flu like symptoms and then get cured on their own as innate immune system
triggers antibody formation that provides resistance against the diseases (Chiu, 2013;
Kistler et al., 2007; Wrammert et al., 2008). In both developed and developing countries the
signs of common flu have not been a cause of concern though some vaccines have been
developed recently and elderly are advised to take shots yearly as they have compromised
immune systems (Voordouw et al., 2004). However, the spread of Novel Covid-19 has
alarmed people all over the world. It is important to understand how the virus will fare
in the alien environments. Therefore, interdisciplinary research involving biologists, data
scientists, mathematicians, clinicians is required in order to work towards stopping the
spread of these diseases and design appropriate methods, drugs to contain it before the
situation gets out of hand.

The present virus that first manifested in Wuhan is different from other Corona
viruses known to humankind, and that is the reason for being cautious. Basic symptoms
resemble the normal flu-like symptoms that can result in cough, cold, headache and body
ache. The more severe consequences include acute respiratory tract infections that culminate
into pneumonia (WHO report, 2020). In more severe cases, especially old people also
develop secondary infections that start affecting other vital organs and in worst cases leading
to death of any individuals which can be cured for most infected individuals (Xu et al.,
2020). The fast pace at which it is spreading from human to human contact is the current
major reason of worry, and this what we show through a concise mathematical model in this
paper. The infections can spread through air (if the infected individual is less than one meter
apart from uninfected individuals), mostly through the droplets of infected people since the
virus stays alive in droplets on the surfaces for many days. As soon as it gets into the host, it
replicates in the body, and the body becomes a reservoir (Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020).
However, in some cases, the virus can stay latent inside the body and may not cause any
disease symptoms, but if this person is a carrier, then he/she can spread the disease to others
who come in contact with the droplets of the person that are released during coughing or
sneezing. The symptoms resemble people who catch seasonal flu like symptoms ranging
from cough, cold, fever to shortness of breath (WHO, 2020; Wu, 2020). As the symptoms
shown by the person infected with Novel Covid-19 are similar and over lapping with other
common flu, it is not easy to identify the carriers and therefore, the transmission cannot be
easily contained.
First few reported cases of Covid-19 infected people had shared a history of
human- animal contact at live game markets. The World Health Organization has
declared it a pandemic after more than 200,500 confirmed cases of infection and more
than 9,000 deaths across 115 countries (https://www.who.int/). The virus epidemiology
has been understood in China where research teams, institutes and scientists and various
cross sectors worked in coordination and today China has been able to control it in the worst
affected areas (Zhau et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). This shows the importance of
coordinated, well-funded research, especially in fields crucial to humankind‚Äôs survival.

India tops the list of countries with highest population and has been trying hard to negotiate

the problems and challenges thrown by this overwhelming population (Ministry of Health,
GOI, 2020). The rise in population has already created crisis for health sector, education and
has caused poverty elevation. With the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Covid-19, the
country must gear up to confront it. It is important for Indian Scientists to come together and
study the pathogenicity in the Indian context. In India, the first case was reported in the end of
January this year, and the number has grown to touch 800 as on March 28, 2020. But India is a
peninsula and the temperature, humidity and topography is variable, hence the factoring of
variables will also have an implication on mortality and morbidity. Also, education, awareness
and understanding of people, socio-economic status is variable, so the infection percentage, the
magnitude of impact will also be different. This calls for regional data assessment and
modelling. Besides, mathematical and ecological modelling can help in predicting the disease
course. The data generator through these models can consider various variables that are
specific to the country and give some predictions. This can help in a fair assessment and put all
the fake and unscientific assumptions on hold. This data can also help in giving
recommendations to the health care agencies.
The present article aims to throw light on the present situation in India and support the action
plan of physical distancing as stressed upon by GoI through a mathematical model capturing the
spread of the disease. The emergence of yet another outbreak of human disease caused by a
pathogen from a viral family formerly thought to be relatively benign underscores the perpetual
challenge of emerging infectious diseases and the importance of sustained preparedness. Major
gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, virus
evolution, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfillment by future studies. Research teams
including biologists, biotechnologists and medical practitioners all over the world are trying to
understand biology, etiology and epidemiology of the diseases (Novel, C. P. E. R. E., 2020;
Lipsitch et al, 2020; Rothan and Byrareddy, 2020). Mathematicians, data scientists and
statisticians have proposed various models to decipher and predict the behavior of the epidemic
in various environments (Mandal et al, 2020; Nesteruk, 2020; Ming et al, 2020; Maier and
Brockmann, 2020). Scientists have also been using dynamic bipartite graphs to model the
physical contact patterns that result from movements of individuals between specific locations
based on the trends available each day (Zhao, 2020)

We used the software Mathematica to do predictive modelling based on the data that is
presently available on the mortality due to the Pandemic Spread by Covid-19.
In the present context, population of India can be classified into three broad classes; namely
I(t): the number of infectives
S(t): the number of susceptible
R(t): the number recovered (recovered, died, or naturally immune to the disease)
Clearly, I(t)+S(t)+R(t) = N where *N is the total population of India (*N is itself a
variable, but treated as a constant in this model consistent with the fact that the course
of this epidemic is short compared with the lifetime of an individual).
This can be seen as a three-compartment model (Figures 1 and 2) and what is our
interest is to have the minima of the I(t) compartment under the prevailing
circumstances.

Figure 2

From what is known about corona viruses, it is evident that the per capita rate of increase in the
number of infectives is directly proportional to the number of susceptible in the vicinity of an
infective and hence, the total intake in the first compartment looks like (kS)I ; where k signifies
the rate of transmission indicated by the average number of people who will catch the virus from
one infected person.

where r is the rate at which infectives recover or die; and clearly, these individuals can no longer
remain infective. Looking at the statistics worldwide (https://www.who.int/) the value of k is
somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5. For the sake of visualization let us take the total world
population to be 100 and a single infective to begin with. A plot code in Mathematica for k=2
(which is much lower than the actual k for many countries at present) gives a striking sketch
(Figure 3).

Figure 3
Starting with just a single infective, the infection peaks up to almost the total population size
before starting to fall down. The situation in India is summarized in the
https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ website.

At present, community transmission has not been validated and the k value is significantly less
than 1 in India. The infection will still continue growing initially before attaining a peak lower
than the total susceptible population this time, as indicated by Figure 4.

Figure 4

To contain the transmission of this virus, it is extremely important to contain the value of k. This
k value is supposedly dependent on many factors that involve both natural (temperature,
humidity) and non-natural factors or personal provisioning measures such as physical distancing,
infectives wearing masks, good hygiene practices such as washing hands with soap for 20
seconds, and so on.
If k is greater than 1, then the disease will grow exponentially after a critical stage and become
an epidemic. The exponential growth occurs because every infected individual replaces himself
or herself by more than one new infected person on an average.
Scientists classify this value as R0 or basic reproduction number. The R0 for measles is around
12, the R0 for COVID19 is around 2.6, and for seasonal flu it is around 1.3. Figure 5 shows how
the number of new cases (per transmission) for seasonal flu is negligible as compared to
COVID19.

Figure 5

However, the exponential growth process can only continue 1) if there are sufficiently many
susceptible individuals available. Once a larger fraction of the population has gone through the
infection and has become immune, the probability of an infected person transmitting the
infection decreases. But as shown in the previous figures, in every transmission from person to
person, the numbers increase exponentially, and we would not have enough hospitals beds,
medical staff and equipment to treat all infected individuals if exponentially increasing number
of people have to be admitted in hospitals every day! We cannot risk such a situation because
any healthcare system (of even the richest and most developed country) will breakdown and we
would have unnecessary deaths. As humans, we have the knowledge to overcome such
situations. We have the knowledge of science, and we should use this to avoid unnecessary
deaths. This is where the second option becomes important to practice, that is 2) physical
distancing to ensure we do not spread (or receive) the virus to (or from) other people. This way,
the virus surviving within the bodies of already infected individuals can no longer survive by
jumping to other persons. The viruses would stop surviving in the infected persons‚Äô bodies after
its 14-day incubation period in that host. This way, we can reduce the number of deaths, and also
reduce the number of infected by blocking the virus from spreading.
All this standard epidemiology is going to work in the Covid-19 case only if this new strain of
virus behaves in a decent way, i.e. within our current grasp of understanding. What if the virus
mutation occurs causing re-infection (Figure 2) or what if there comes a second wave of
infection affecting large numbers? All these apprehensions need a more detailed analysis.
Scientists are working on getting a full picture of the evolution of the virus, but it might take
some time. We need to give scientists this time; we all need to give medical and healthcare

workers the time to deal with new patients every day. We can deal with both these situations
only by lockdown, physical distancing and personal hygiene methods. The cooperation of every
citizen is required.

The above table shows the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra. Maharashtra is
densely populated with Mumbai being an overcrowded city that has a population size of more
than 20 million people to which this highest number is being attributed to. This has happened in
Maharashtra even when the state has not been the first one to get the infection in India. The same
can be paralleled with the Influenza epidemic a century ago which took a toll of estimated 10-20
million people in India alone and warns us of what lies ahead of us, if the present situation goes
uncontrolled, unattended or casually attended.

Also, from the above plots (Figures 3 and 4) , though the transmission rate is very low in
India now, the number of infectives is bound to increase with time. The only way to get the
graph of infectives as a decreasing function of time as per the proposed model is that the
interaction term kSI in the equation (1) tends to zero. That can only happen when infectives
are totally isolated from the susceptible population. The variables will keep on changing
with each passing day as the virus has just reached stage 2 of its disease cycle where there
are no mass causalities and things are under control.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Data suggests that the country is going to see a surge in the cases. However, we have to
understand that variables such as hygiene, physical distancing, staying indoors, and boosting
immune system can flatten the curve. Raising awareness through various platforms including
the social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter is one way of containing the disease.
Each household must be reached and that can be done through vernacular language since large
section of the population is still not conversant in English and Hindi. Government has already
taken measures such as setting testing centres and has designated isolation blocks in hospitals.
This would ease the burden on the existing ones. New makeshift health centers can also be
created as they did in China, which helped them win over the battle despite the high cases there.
Also, the country-lockdown announced by the government is surely going to act as infection
controller and hopefully help India attend to this new challenge in the desired form. Strict
measures have been announced for people who are not following Government Advisory. It is
important to boost the morale of front-line workers (such as medical practitioners and paramedical staff, nursing staff, cleaning staff and house-keeping departments of the hospitals and
health care centres) who are interacting directly with the patients. People who are showing
anxiety symptoms due to restrictions and lock downs need constant counselling. Psychologists,
self-help groups need to offer counselling through electronic media. Indians also need to fight
the menace of superstitions and myths that are being propagated regarding the cure of Corona
related illness. Scientists need to gear up for the task and come forward to do collaborative
research work to understand the spread, containment and eventualities of the pandemic
outbreak. For this, interdisciplinary teams must work together to come out with some concrete
strategy. Research teams have to develop vaccines for which funding, infrastructure, and
adequate facilities are required. So, Covid-19 is a reminder that science cannot take a back seat
and health care, education and research should always hold a top priority. Faith in science and
scientists, and optimism is important at this juncture so that India comes out as a winner in the
battle.
