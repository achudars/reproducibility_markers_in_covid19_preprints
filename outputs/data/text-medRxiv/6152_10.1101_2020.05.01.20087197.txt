National and state wise estimate of time varying reproduction number for COVID-19 in
India during the nationwide lockdown.

Abstract:
To understand the effect of nationwide lockdown on transmissibilty of SARS-CoV-2 in India,
time varying reproduction number during the first weeks of April, 2020 was estimated. The time
varying reproduction number was estimated using EpiEstim package in R programming
language. The reproduction number has come down significantly during the lockdown period
both at national level and in most states but it wasn’t reduced to less than 1. This calls for urgent
need for more effective control measures in addition to lockdown to stop the epidemic spread of
the virus.
Introduction:
Central government of India implemented a nationwide lockdown from midnight of March 24,
2020 as a response to growing threat of COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel corona virus
(SARS-CoV-2 virus) (1). Despite implementing one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the
reported number of COVID-19 cases in India continue to increase even after more than 5 weeks
of lockdown (2). This has led to questions on the effectiveness of the lockdown in controlling the
spread of the virus (3). Further, there are inter-state differences in spread of the virus with some
states reporting lower number of cases than before and others reporting surge in incidence of
COVID-19 cases.
In this study, to understand the transmissibilty of the virus during the lockdown period in India
and in individual states, we measured time varying reproduction number for the first 4 weeks of
April, 2020.
Method:
We estimated time varying reproduction number for India and individual states by implementing
the package “EpiEStim” in R programming language (4). The method used in the package was
described by Cori. et.al. (5). Total and state wise incidence of COVID-19 cases during 1st April
to 28th April was retrieved from the crowdsourced web platform covid19india.org (2). Mean
genertion time of 5.2 days and SD of 2.8 days as reported from China was used to estimate the
reproduction number (6).
Results:
Table 1 shows the estimated reproduction number for the first(2nd to 8th) and fourth week(22nd to
28th ) of April, 2020 for each state and India. Overall for India, the reproduction number came

down from 2.39 during first week to 1.19 during last week of April.Due to the time between
infection and symtopm onset and delay between symptomp onset and testing and reporting of
results, the reproduction number during first week of April might reflect the reproduction
number during pre-lockdown days. Also the reproduction number estimate for initial weeks
might be a more of an underestimate than later weeks because of comparatively much lower
testing rate during the earlier days. Eventhough the reprodution number has decreased
significantly which would result in ‘flattening’ of the epidemic curve, it is still not less than 1 to
effectively stop the curve. Among the states, Bihar and Jharkhand continue to have high
reproduction number. Major states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and West
Bengal have higher reproduction number than national average. Karnataka, Rajasthan, UP and
Telangana show less than 1 reproduction number but it could be result of poor testing rate for
SARS CoV-2 in some of these states. In particular, Telangana have
reduced the number of tests done per day even when number of cases reported was increasing
during the previous days (7,8). This resulted in a sudden decrease in number of new reported
cases and thus a very low reproduction number of 0.35 during the last week of April.
Figure 1 to 6 show the change in weekly reproduction number of major states and India. The
reproduction number against a particular date is for a week with the last day of the week ending
on the particular date.
Conclusion:
There is singificant decrease in the reproduction number during the lockdown but it is not
reduced to less than 1 to stop the epidemic. This underlies the fact that lockdown alone is not
enough to stop the epidemic in India and other measures such as extensive testing, contact
tracing and isolation of COVID-19 positve subjects is essential. Limitations of the estimation
include poor testing rate and variations in testing rate between states. Since enough data is not
publicly available to estimate generation time for COVID-19, the generation time reported by a
study from China was used and this could limit the accuracy of the estimates for the reprodcution
number.
