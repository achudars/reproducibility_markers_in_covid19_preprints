Abstract
Background: Differential exposure to public activities and non-household contacts may
contribute to stark deprivation-related inequalities in SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes,
but has not been directly investigated. We set out to investigate whether participants in Virus
Watch – a large community cohort study based in England and Wales – reported different
levels of exposure to public activities and non-household contacts during the Autumn-Winter
phase of the COVID-19 pandemic according to postcode-level socioeconomic deprivation.
Methods: Participants (n=20120-25228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during
three weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020, and mid-February 2021.
Deprivation was quantified based on participants’ postcode of residence using English or
Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed effect models with
robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure
to public activities during each survey period.
Results: Relative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most
deprived areas persistently exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (aRR
range across time points 1.73-8.52), public transport (aRR 3.13-5.73), work or education
outside of the household (aRR 1.09-1.21), essential shops (aRR 1.09-1.13) and nonhousehold contacts (aRR 1.15-1.19) across multiple survey periods.
Conclusion: Differential exposure to essential public activities in deprived communities is
likely to contribute to inequalities in infection risk and outcomes during the COVID-19
pandemic. Public health interventions to reduce exposure during essential activities and
financial and practical support to enable low-paid workers to stay at home during periods of
intense transmission may reduce COVID-related inequalities.

Introduction:
Socioeconomically deprived communities have been disproportionately impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing higher rates of infection and mortality than less deprived
communities as well as greater social and economic disruption1-4.

Public activities - such as working outside the home, visiting shops, or using public transport
- may promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through contact with potentially infectious
individuals and through aerosol transmission5,6. Consequently, ‘lockdown’ restrictions including closure of or access limitations to non-essential shops and services, and
recommendations to stay at home - have been a key pandemic response strategy
worldwide7,8. However, socioeconomic deprivation influences individuals’ ability to stay at
home - e.g. as a result of lower ability to work from home and greater reliance on public
transport - as well as the level of contact with other people in the workplace. Consequently,
differential exposure to public activities may contribute to higher rates of infections, and
consequently hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19, in deprived communities2,4.

Empirical investigation into the relationship between daily activities and risk of respiratory
infection is limited. Public activities involving potentially poorly-ventilated, high-footfall
settings and/or close contact with others - e.g. public transport, visiting cafes or restaurants,
shops and supermarkets, venues such as cinemas, theatres and concerts, and social events
such as parties - are associated with risk of seasonal respiratory infection9. While emerging
findings from the COVID-19 pandemic show that measures limiting public mixing are
associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level10-12, data on the
nature of individuals’ day-to-day activities are currently limited. Although differential exposure
to public activities may influence socioeconomic inequalities in infection and mortality risk,
data are lacking regarding how exposure to such activities varies in relation to sociodemographic characteristics including deprivation.

Understanding how deprivation is associated with exposure to public activities is
consequently important to ensure that public health and policy responses to COVID-19 and
related inequalities are grounded in evidence. We set out to address this gap using data on
public activities and non-household contacts collected through the Virus Watch cohort
study13.

Methods:
Survey Procedure
We used data from three consecutive survey waves of the Virus Watch household cohort
study13. Households were recruited via post, social media, SMS messages, and
personalised letters disseminated by General Practices. Eligibility criteria were: residence in
England or Wales, informed consent or assent provided by all household members, internet
access and an email address, at least one household member able to complete surveys in
English, and household size between 0-6 household members (due to survey infrastructure
limitations). Virus Watch study procedures are described in detail in the study protocol13 and
include completion of monthly questionnaires into pandemic-relevant demographic,
psychosocial/behavioral and health-related factors from which the current data were drawn.
Participants were prompted on 01 December 2020, 04 January 2021, and 17 February 2021
to complete an online questionnaire regarding their social activities and contacts during the
preceding week. These survey weeks corresponded to key timepoints in terms of epidemic
waves and/or government legislation regarding public activities in England and Wales. The
first survey (covering 24 Nov 2020 - 01 Dec 2020) corresponded to the final week of the
second English national lockdown14, and the early stages of a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases
and the emergence of the Lineage B.1.1.7 variant. The second survey week (23 Dec 2020 27 Dec 2020) corresponded to the December holiday period, during which there was notable
variation in rules around social mixing across regions that was altered in the run-up to the
holiday period due to sharp increases in COVID-19 cases in some regions. Indoor mixing
with non-household members was not allowed in London, the South East or East of
England, while indoor mixing on the 25th December was allowed with a maximum of three
other households across other English regions15 and with two other households in Wales16.
The third survey week (09 Feb 2021 - 16 Feb 2021) occurred during the third national
lockdown for both England and Wales16,17 – a period of deceleration in reported cases
nationally.
Survey respondents reported the days they undertook a range of activities during each
period (see Outcomes below) and their number of non-household/support bubble close
contacts (‘face-to-face contact with someone less than a metre away, even if a face-covering
or mask was worn, or within 2 metres for 15 minutes or more’18). The wording of questions in
the second and third surveys was edited to specifically refer to contact with non-household
or support bubble members (vs non-household members) for clarity. Survey data were
extracted on the 25 Feb 2021.

Exposure
The exposure of interest, deprivation, was measured at small local area-level based on the
Ministry for Housing and Local Government (in England) and Welsh Government (in Wales)
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintiles (1=most deprived, 5= least deprived).
Participants provided household postcodes on study registration, which were used to derive
IMD quintiles based on linkage with the May 2020 ONS Postcode Lookup file. Consequently,
only survey respondents who provided a valid postcode at baseline were included in these
analyses.
Outcome
The following activities were classified as binary outcomes of interest (yes/no during given
period): driving or riding in a car/taxi with a non-household member, taking public transport
(underground trains, overground trains, buses, or trams), going to work or education outside
the household, social/entertainment activities (defined as any of: attending the theatre,
cinema, concert or sports event; eating in a restaurant, café or canteen; going to a bar, pub
or club; going to a party), going to essential shops, going to non-essential shops or personal
care services, and close contact with one or more non-household/support bubble members.
In the first and second surveys, exposure to car/taxis was asked as a single item; in the third
survey, this item was disaggregated into separate car and taxi exposures.
Covariates
Age, sex, and geographic region were considered relevant a-priori potential confounders due
to plausible relationships with both IMD and activities. Age and sex were derived from
participants’ responses to demographic questions at study baseline. Age was classified as
child (0-15), adult (16-64), and older adult (65+). Region was derived from linking
participants’ postcode to ONS national region using the May 2020 National Statistics
Postcode Lookup file. For the current analyses, regions were classified into the following
three categories based on differing activity-related legislation and rates of SARS-CoV-2:
London/South-East/ East of England (initial Tier 4 regions), Wales, and other regions.
Statistical Analyses
To assess the age-, sex-, and region-adjusted risk of reporting each activity by IMD quintile,
we used Poisson mixed-effect models with robust standard errors19 using the mepoisson
command in Stata version 16. All available data were entered into the models; data were
complete for IMD and region and missing data were limited across time points for age group
(range across time 0.29%-0.35%, n=59-84) and sex (range 1.06%-1.48%, n=217-310). The

least deprived quintile (IMD 5) was used as the reference category. We included a random
term to account for household-level clustering. We applied the Benjamini-Hochberg
Procedure (false discovery rate = 0.05) to correct for multiple testing.
We performed a sensitivity analysis stratifying the relationship between IMD and attending
work/education settings by age (child <16 years vs adult ≥16 years) to account for potential
effect modification, as the impact of legislation around school openings may have had a
more consistent effect on children across IMD quintiles than legislation around work/higher
education for adults. As attendance of work/education settings is likely to influence nonhousehold contacts, we also stratified the relationship between IMD and non-household
contacts by age. For adults, we also performed a further sensitivity analysis for these
outcomes controlling for presence of children (<16) in the household. This was considered a
potential confounder due to the negative association between maternal education (likely
associated with small area-level deprivation) and likelihood of having children20, along with
the likely influence of COVID-related school closures on the working patterns of parents and
carers.
Ethics and Consent
The Virus Watch study was approved by the Hampstead NHS Health Research Authority
Ethics Committee: 20/HRA/2320, and conformed to the ethical standards set out in the
Declaration of Helsinki. All members of participating households provided informed consent
for themselves and, where relevant, for dependent children.
Results:
Table 1 reports the characteristics of the full Virus Watch cohort as of 25 Feb 2021 (n=46539
individuals from 22556 households) and of respondents to each activity survey who provided
a valid postcode at baseline (n=20120-25228).

Poisson mixed models for the first survey period (24 Nov 2020 - 01 Dec 2020) (Table 2 and
Supplementary Figure 1a/b) indicated that – compared to the least deprived group –
participants in all other IMD quintiles had elevated risk following multiple comparison
correction for vehicle-sharing (aRR range: 1.22 [1.08-1.38] – 1.73 [1.50-1.99]) and for
attending work or education outside the home (aRR range: 1.07 [1.01-1.12] – 1.12 [1.031.18]). When stratified by age, adults - but not children - in IMD quintiles 1 and 2
demonstrated elevated risk of exposure to work or education settings (Supplementary Table
4), and adults in IMD 1-3 demonstrated elevated risk after controlling for presence of
children in the household (Supplementary Table 6). Participants in IMD quintiles 1-3 also
had an elevated risk of exposure to public transport (aRR range: 1.41 [1.21-1.65] – 3.13
[2.63-3.70]). Confidence intervals indicated that the two most deprived quintiles had elevated
risk of exposure to public transport compared to all other quintiles. Relative to the least
deprived IMD quintile, the second most deprived quintile had greater risk of visiting essential
shops (aRR: 1.07 [1.04-1.10]). No differences emerged by IMD for social and entertainment
activities, visiting non-essential shops, or healthcare settings. While no difference emerged
in the main analyses for exposure to non-household contacts, age-stratified analysis
(Supplementary Table 5) indicated elevated risk for adults in IMD 1 and 2 (aRR respectively:
1.11 [1.06-1.18] and 1.07 [1.02-1.12]), which persisted after controlling for the presence of
children in the household (Supplementary Table 6).
In the second survey period (23 Dec 2020 - 27 Dec 2020) (Table 2 and Supplementary
Figure 2a/b) all investigated IMD groups had elevated risk of vehicle-sharing (aRR range:
1.24 [1.07-1.45] – 1.97 [1.65-2.35]) and public transport use (aRR range: 1.80 [1.44-2.45] –
5.53 [4.37-7.00]) compared to the least deprived group. As above, confidence intervals for
IMD 1-2 indicated elevated risk for public transport compared to all other quintiles. IMD
quintiles 1-3 also had an elevated risk of attending work or education outside the home (aRR
range: 1.14 [1.04-1.25] – 1.20 [1.09-1.33]); when stratified by age, this finding was consistent
for adults only (Supplementary Table 4) and remained following adjustment for presence of
children in the household (Supplementary Table 6). IMD quintiles 1 and 2 reported elevated
risk of visiting an essential shop (aRR respectively: 1.09 [1.04-1.14] and 1.07 [1.04-1.11]).
These groups also demonstrated elevated risk of exposure to non-household contacts (aRR
respectively: 1.19 [1.09-1.29] and 1.11 [1.03-1.20]), which was present only for adults after
age-stratification (Supplementary Table 5) and remained following adjustment for children in
the household (Supplementary Table 6). Again, no differences were identified for social and
entertainment activities, visiting non-essential shops, or healthcare settings.

Consistent with previous timepoints, all investigated IMD groups had elevated risk of
reporting public transport use during the third survey period (09 Feb 2021- 16 Feb 2021)
(Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3a/b) compared to the least deprived group (aRR range:
1.59 [1.29-1.95] – 5.73 [4.65-7.05]). Confidence intervals for IMD 1 and 2 again indicated
elevated risk of exposure to public transport compared to all other IMD quintiles. Car-sharing
versus taxi use were disaggregated in this survey, and IMD 1-3 had elevated risk of taxi use
compared to the least deprived group (aRR range 2.49 [1.75-3.53] - 8.52 [4.65-7.05]). No
difference was found by IMD for car sharing, which was less-commonly reported overall
(supplementary Table 2). Similar to previous timepoints, IMD 1-2 had elevated risk of
exposure to essential shops (aRR respectively 1.13 [1.08-1.17] and 1.08 [1.04-1.12]) and to
workplace or education settings outside the home (aRR respectively 1.21 [1.10-1.34] and
1.20 [1.11-1.31]). Again, age-stratification (Supplementary Table 4) indicated no difference in
risk of exposure to work/education settings for children, while adults in IMD 1 and 2
demonstrated elevated risk. Adults in IMD 1-3 demonstrated excess risk of exposure to
these settings following adjustment for children in the household. IMD 1 also had elevated
risk of exposure to non-household contacts (aRR: 1.15 [1.06-1.24]); excess risk was
demonstrated by adults in IMD 1 and 2 following age stratification (Supplementary Table 5),
and IMD 1-3 following adjustment for presence of children in the household (Supplementary
Table 6). For the first time across measured timepoints, participants in IMD 1 also
demonstrated excess risk of reporting social and entertainment activities (aRR: 2.64 [1.414.93]). No differences were found by IMD for visiting non-essential shops or healthcare
settings.

Discussion:
Our findings suggest that differences in essential daily activities – such as using public
transport, attending work/education settings outside the home, and visiting essential shops –
likely contribute to elevated risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality in deprived
communities. Patterns of differential exposure to essential activities were consistent across
the three survey periods. Adults - but not children - consistently demonstrated differential
exposure to workplace/education settings and non-household contacts, likely reflecting the
effects of legislation around school openings for children. We found limited evidence of
deprivation-related differences for activities more reflective of individual choice, with no
differences in visiting non-essential shops or services and elevated risk of social and
entertainment activities in the most deprived group at one time-point only (February 2021).

This is the first study to investigate the relationship between deprivation and exposure to
specific daily activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Virus Watch cohort comprises
households from across England and Wales with considerable diversity in age, ethnicity, and
area-level deprivation. However, survey respondents were not demographically
representative of the population. Self-reported activities may have been affected by recall
and social desirability biases, though the latter may have been minimised by online survey
delivery. A further limitation was the inability to quantify infection risk associated with each
activity due to insufficient data. This will be the focus of future work when additional
virological and serological outcome data are available. Quantifying the number and intensity
of contacts per setting and any risk mitigation strategies were also beyond the scope of
these surveys. Despite relevant age-stratified analysis, we were not able to directly
distinguish between workplace and education settings in the current study. IMD is also an
area-level measure and may not always reflect individuals’ socioeconomic position. Further
investigation into the influence of individual-level indicators of socio-economic position
including occupation and education is warranted, as is investigation into the interrelationship
between deprivation, ethnicity, and infection risk. Investigating workplace attendance by
occupation is also an important area for further investigation given differential exposure to
workplace/education settings for adults.

In the UK, lockdown and social distancing measures appear to have reduced contacts and
mobility in public locations compared to pre-pandemic levels21-23; however, the current
findings suggest that deprivation-related differences in exposure to essential public activities
are consistently present during periods of stringent regulations. These findings are

consistent with a USA-based study24 that constructed granular spatio-temporal mobility
networks based on mobile phone data for 98 million people across ~57,000 neighbourhoods.
Integrating these networks within a metapopulation susceptible-exposed-infectiousrecovered model allowed an accurate fit to observed case trajectories and predicted
ethnicity- and deprivation-related risk gradients. This study found that disadvantaged groups’
mobility did not reduce as sharply as people living in majority-white and higher-income
areas, and that the locations that they visited were typically smaller and more crowded.
Interpretation of activity and contact patterns reported in the current study should take into
account changes in the wider context at these times. The lockdown restrictions that were in
place during the November and February surveys were similar in England; key differences
being the closure of primary and secondary schools and increased fines in January and
February14,17. The English policy context surrounding the December survey differed
substantially: different 'tier'-based restrictions were in place across England, and rules for
contact on December 25 (Christmas Day) were relaxed only in some regions. No indoor
mixing with non-household members was allowed in London, the South East or East of
England; other English regions were allowed meeting a maximum of three households15. In
Wales, the late November survey fell two weeks after the 17-day national 'firebreak'
lockdown ended, and a further Welsh lockdown started on December 2016, with rules relaxed
to allow mixing with up to two other households on December 25 only16. In February, Wales
was again under lockdown. Differential exposure to essential activities and non-household
contacts was consistently observed across survey periods. Consequently, deprivationrelated inequalities in infection and mortality risk driven by essential public activities may
persist or become exacerbated during periods of stringent lockdown restrictions. Measuring
differential activities during periods of less intensive or no restrictions on social mixing is
consequently warranted.
The current findings suggest that interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 exposure on public
transport, in essential shops, and in workplace and education settings where in-person
attendance is required may reduce inequalities in infection risk. Deprivation-related
differences in exposure to these essential activities are likely to reflect structural factors that
constrain individual choice, such as car ownership, ability to work from home and disposable
income. Providing greater financial and practical support to facilitate increased uptake of
testing and adherence to isolation when required may also prevent mortality and reduce
inequalities25. Interventions and public health communications targeting activities that do not
consistently differ between social groups over time, such as fines for attending social
activities, conversely appear unlikely to reduce COVID-related inequalities.
