Abstract
The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel pandemic disease that spreads very fast
and causes severe respiratory problem to its carrier and thereby results to death in some cases. In
this research, we studied the trend, model Nigeria daily COVID-19 cases and forecast for the
future occurrences in the country at large. We adopt the Box and Jenkins approach. The time plot
showed that the cases of COVID-19 rises rapidly in recent time. KPSS test confirms the nonstationarity of the process (p < 0.05) before differencing. The test also confirmed the stationarity
of the process (p > 0.05) after differencing. Various ARIMA (p,d,q) were examined with their
respective AICs and Log-likelihood. ARIMA (1, 2, 1) was selected as the best model due to its
least AIC (559.74) and highest log likelihood (-276.87). Both Shapiro-Wilk test and Box test
performed confirm the fitness of the model (p > 0.05) for the series. Forecast for 30 days was
then made for COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Conclusively, the model obtained in this research can
be used to model, monitor and forecast the daily occurrence of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.
Keywords: COVID-19, Model, Forecast, AIC, Log –likelihood.

Introduction:

Covid-19 as it is popularly abbreviated means coronavirus disease 2019. This virus surface on
the media in December 2019 in a city known as Wuhan is china. It was confirmed to be
pandemic according to world health organization WHO (2020a), since the spread of the disease
is not only limited to china but to the entire world. The first case of this pandemic outbreak was
recorded by the national center for disease control (NCDC, 2020) in Nigeria on 27 February
2020. According to WHO (2020a), The virus was found not to be a living thing but a protein
molecule, which makes it difficult to die. The survival of the virus depends on the surface and
the environment which determines how they inoculate and incubate. Studies from the literatures
show that, the virus which causes severe respiratory problem to its carrier can only disintegrate
and decay after it is subjected to high temperature and humidity. Covid-19 can survive in a cold
atmosphere because of its adaptation to low temperature, that’s why it spreads faster in countries
with lower temperature, and study reveals that countries with higher temperature have lower risk
for its spread (WHO, 2020a). Covid-19 needs material medium for its propagation, when it get in
contact with the nose , targeted the cells, degraded it and multiply to other part of the respiratory

organ including the lungs. When the virus gets contacted with the cells, the body immune system
fights back and reduces the efficiency and spread the virus to the entire cell. Due to this, there is
high mortality rate in the older people since they have low immune system to fight the virus and
this makes the number of recovered cases in the youths to be higher because they have stronger
immune system.
According to the world health organization (WHO 2020a), only 2% of the reported cases were
below the age of 18 years, and the virus molecule can survive for about 8 hours on paper and
fabric while it can survive for more hours on metals, plastic and glass. When an individual has
contact with any of these materials which has been contaminated and still in its inoculation
period, the virus will temporarily settle on the host, if the host eventually gets to mouth, the eyes
or inner part of nose, which are medium to the nasal area, such individual is at high risk on being
infected. The initial symptoms include sneezing, itchy eye, dry cough and so on. Recent study
shows that, if an individual have closed relationship with a patient with any of the
aforementioned symptoms, such individual will be in isolation for at least two weeks, before
undergoing a test, if tested positive, will immediately be quarantine for immediate medical care
and treatment. In this research, we focus on the study of the trend of the pandemic virus,
investigate the causes, develop a suitable model to determine its trend and also use the model to
predict future expected developed cases.

Literature Review:
Though the COVID-19 is a novel pandemic outbreak, but several authors have made immense
contribution towards investigating the outbreak and proffer immediate solution to curb the spread
of the disease. Ying et al. (2020) published an up to date review of the literatures on the novel
pandemic disease. This shall be discussed in details in this section. According to WHO (2020),
the average reproductive number is 1.95, that is, it ranges from 1.4 to 2.5. Joseph et al. (2020)
was among recent authors to write about the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, the authors
applied the use of the Stochastic Markov chain Monte-Carlo methods with sampling prior using
the posterior distribution. The authors discovered that the average reproductive number (R0) for
the pandemic outbreak is 2.68. i.e. (R0=2.68). Shen et al. (2020) developed a model with
population divided into five compartments, the authors introduced the non-linear least squares
method to get the point estimate with R 0=6.49, which far greater than the WHO projection. Also,
Lin et al (2020) introduce statistical exponential growth with the use of SARS by fitting the
exponential growth using poisson regression, the R 0 was found to be 2.90, which is not too wide
than the WHO value. Read et al. (2020) also developed a mathematical transmission model by
using the Poisson distribution to assume the daily time increment. The reproductive number was
found to be 3.11. The mathematical incidence decay and exponential adjustment model was
introduced by Majumder et al. (2020). The authors adopted mean serial interval lengths in fitting
the model. Their R0 was recorded 2.55, which is very close to the WHO standard.
Recent articles have published in modelling the occurrence and studying the trend of the novel
COVID-19 pandemic, such articles include Cori et al (2020), Dung et al (2020), Yuan et al
(2020) and WHO (2020b). In this article, instead of using the basic reproductive number in

determining the spread of the pandemic outbreak, we intend to adopt a suitable ARIMA model
that will assist in forecasting the occurrence of the spread in Nigeria.

3.0 Methodology
The Box-Jenkins approach will be adopted in this research and the autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) will be discussed in this section.
3.1 Box - Jenkins Approach
The Box-Jenkins refers to a systematic method of identifying, fitting, checking, and using
integrated autoregressive, moving average (ARIMA) time series models. The method is
appropriate for time series of medium to long length (at least 50 observations). In this research
we will adopt the Box-Jenkins method, concentrating on the Arima model. One of the steps in
the Box - Jenkins method is to transform a non-stationary series into a stationary one.
3.2 Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Process (ARIMA)
ARIMA models are, in theory, the most general type of models for forecasting a time series
which when not stationary can made to be “stationary” by differencing if necessary, probably in
conjunction with nonlinear transformations such as logging or deflating. A random variable that
is a time series is stationary if its statistical properties are all constant over time. A stationary
series has no trend, its variations around its mean have a constant value, and it changes in a
consistent way, i.e., its short-term random time patterns always look the same in a statistical
sense. The latter condition means that its autocorrelations (correlations with its own prior
deviations from the mean) remain constant over time.
There autoregressive moving average (p,q) is of the form
X t 1 X t  1  2 X t  2  ...   p X t  p  1 t  1   2 t  2  ...  q  t  q

(1)

The white noise of the process is expressed as{εt}. In lag form, equation (1)
becomes;
X t  1 X t  1  2 X t  2  ...   p X t  p  t  1 t  1   2 t  2  ...   q  t  q

φ (B) X t=θ( B)ε t
Xt = θ( B) ε t φ−1 (B).
ε t = φ (B) X t θ−1 (B)
Xt = ϑ (B) ε t

Where
ϑ ( B )=θ (B)ε t φ−1 ( B),
ϑ ( B ) is the phi-weight.
ε t = π ( B) Xt

Where,
π ( B) = θ( B) ε t φ−1 (B),
π ( B )represent the pi-weight.
An ARIMA process of order (p, d, q) with ARMA (p, q) process can be defined
by:
φ ( β ) ∇ d X t =θ ( β ) ε t
Where p, d, q are non-negative integers.
Note: When d =0, the ARIMA (p, d, q) becomes ARMA(p, q).
In this research the ARIMA model would be applied to the data on Covid-19 to model total daily
new cases of the virus from inception February 27 2020 and to further forecast for Total daily
occurrence of the virus in the country for a period of time.
3.3 Diagnostic checking
The most useful and informative diagnostic checks deal with determining whether the
assumptions conditioning the innovation series are satisfied by the residuals of the autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Diagnostic checks only have meaning if the
parameters of the model are efficiently estimated using the maximum likelihood approach at the
estimation stage. For all of the diagnostic checks presented in this paper, it is assumed that a
maximum likelihood estimator is used to estimate the model parameters. The paper discusses
Shapiro and box test, whiteness tests, portmanteau tests, normality tests, constant variance tests,
and so on.
4.0 Analysis and Result:
The result of the analysis obtained from daily cases of total Covid-19 in Nigeria between
February 27, 2020 and May 1, 2020 is presented in this section. The exploratory analysis, Auto
Correlation Function (ACF),Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF), Augmented DickeyFuller (ADF) test, Kwitatkowski Philips Schmidt Shin (KPSS) test, Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) test were carried out, and
the result were presented in section 4. More so, the discussion of the analysis is presented in the
next section.

Discussion

Table 1 and Figure 1 show the summary of statistics of Covid-19 daily cases in Nigeria from
February 27 to May 1 and the histogram of the distribution of the cases. The exploratory data
analysis was done to determine the average case for the time frame used in this research, it was
recorded that average daily number of thirty-four (34) cases were reported, with the initial case
reported to be 1, this was at the initial stage of the outbreak, and the maximum daily case
recorded so far is 238 as at May 1. Both the standard error and variance are very high indicating
a high difference among the daily cases. Figures 2 and 3 also show the time plots of total daily
Covid-19 cases before and after differencing. The result shows that the process is not stable over
time. High and persistence rise is greatly noticed from the plot. Table 2 contains KPSS test

statistics. The test was used to confirm the non-stationarity of the process before differencing and
stationarity of the process after first differencing.
Figures 4 and 5 show the ACF and PACF of the series. The ACF decays slowly while the PACF
only exceeds the significant bound at lag 1 and 5 only. Table 3 show the summary of ARIMA
(p,d,q) models examined with their AICs and Log-likelihoods. The result showed that ARIMA
(1,2,1) has the least AIC (559.74) and the highest Log-likelihood (-276.87). Hence, ARIMA
(1,2,1) is selected for the process. The model selected is written as:
Yt =−0.4978 Y t −1 + ɛ t −0.8874 ɛ t −1
Also, Figure 6 shows the diagnostic plot for the selected model. The results shows that the model
fits the process (p-values > 0.5), thereby we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
the model fit the daily occurrence of Covid-19. Table 4 shows Shapiro-Wilk and Box test and the
two tests attest to the goodness of fit of the fitted model. Conclusively, forecast for thirty days
(May 8, 2020 to June 6, 2020) was then made for the daily cases of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria
(see Appendix II) to show how crucial and paramount the need for quick and proactive measure
and intervention to curb high and persistence increase in the occurrence of Covid-19 cases.

6.0

Conclusion

Succinctly put, the rate of daily occurrence of the novel pandemic Covid-19 outbreak in Nigeria
continue to increase every day. Thereby resulting into high loss of lives which may lead to
extinction and paralysis of the economy and so its control must be of high concern. Hence, the
model obtained from this research can be used to model, monitor and forecast the future case of
Covid-19 in Nigeria as a whole so as to put a stop to the high mortality rate caused by the
pandemic disease. The fear for the coronavirus is really high among people due to the high rate
of its spread and lack of adequate knowledge about the cause(s) and how it spread. Hence, more
articles and publications about sensitizing people on the coronavirus need to be made available.
Also, preventive measure highlighted by WHO such as sanitization of hand regularly, avoiding
direct contact with eyes, mouth and nose with unclean hands, keeping distance of at least one
meter, avoiding handshake, not travelling while one is sick and seeking medical attention when
symptoms of the Covid-19 such as high fever and so on are observed are hereby recommended
as solutions to avoid quick spread of the diseases. It is expected that effective implementation of
the above recommendations will guide and help in preventing the spread of the disease and
thereby reduces its daily occurrences.
