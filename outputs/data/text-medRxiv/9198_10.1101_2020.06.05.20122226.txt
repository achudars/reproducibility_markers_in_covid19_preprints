Abstract
We examined the link between BMI and risk of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 and risk of
COVID-19-related death among UK Biobank participants. Among 4855 participants tested
for SARS-CoV-2 in hospital, 839 were positive and of these 189 died from COVID-19.
Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of interest to test
positivity and case-fatality, adjusting for confounding factors. BMI was associated strongly
with positive test, and risk of death related to COVID-19. The gradient of risk in relation to
BMI was steeper in those under 70, compared with those aged 70 years or older for COVID19 related death (Pinteraction=0.03). BMI was more strongly related to test positivity
(Pinteraction=0.010) and death (Pinteraction=0.002) in non-whites, compared with whites. These
data add support for adiposity being more strongly linked to COVID-19-related deaths in
younger people and non-white ethnicities. If future studies confirm causality, lifestyle
interventions to improve adiposity status may be important to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in
all, but perhaps particularly, non-white communities.

We recently proposed multiple mechanisms by which obesity/ectopic fat might enhance risk
for severe COVID-19.1 Our work was stimulated by observations in hospital intensive care
units which showed that body mass indices (BMI) above 35 or 40 were associated with
poorer prognosis.2,3 However, whether BMI is linearly associated with COVID-19-related
risk in both sexes, in non-white ethnicities, and across ages, is not known. Whether adiposity
might mediate higher COVID-19-related risks, including death, in Black and other ethnic
minority groups in the UK is important to understand. To address these issues, we used UK
Biobank data to examine the association between BMI and test positivity for SARS-CoV-2
infection in hospital, as well as COVID-19-related deaths.
Over 500,000 participants (aged 50-81 on 16th March 2020) from the UK general population
were recruited between 2006-2010, with details described elsewhere. For this study, only
participants from English assessment centres who were alive on 1st March 2020 were
included. Participants with complete data for baseline anthropometric variables and
covariates were included (n=374,922). The exposure of interest was BMI. Public Health
England (PHE) provided data on SARS-CoV-2 tests, including the specimen date, location,
and result. Data were available for the period 16th March 2020 to 31st May 2020. Tests were
conducted on 5,274 participants in the available cohort. Of these, 419 were excluded because
the tests were conducted outside the hospital setting. Overall, 839 participants tested positive
in hospital and 189 of these individuals died from COVID-19 out of 374,503 participants.
Deaths were defined as COVID-19 related if there was an ICD-10 code U07.1 or U07.2 on
the death certificate.
Robust Poisson models with penalised thin plate splines were run relating exposures of
interest to positive tests in hospital. Models were adjusted for age, socioeconomic status
(Townsend Index), ethnicity, smoking (current, former, never), alcohol intake (unit/week),
and baseline cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Interactions between adiposity measures
and three moderators (sex, current age [<70 vs â‰¥70], and ethnicity [white vs non-white], were
tested.
BMI was strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 test positivity, in a broadly linear fashion
(Figure 1a), despite the model allowing for non-linear associations. There was a hint of a
stronger gradient of risk across BMI (Pinteraction=0.09) in men compared with women for a
positive SAR-SCoV-2 test, although no clear evidence for such interaction for COVID-19related death (Figure 1b). There was a stronger gradient (Pinteraction=0.03) of risk across BMI
for COVID-19-related deaths but not SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in those under 70 versus 70
years or above (Figure 1c, d). BMI was more strongly related to risk for SARS-CoV-2 test
positivity (Pinteraction=0.010) and COVID-19- related death (Pinteraction=0.002) in non-whites
versus whites (Figures 1e, f).
Our findings have some limitations. Only a small proportion of overall UK Biobank
participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 but consistent findings for test positivity and
COVID-19-related death provide confidence that observations are likely real. Total numbers
of deaths were also modest at 189. Those untested, as well as those tested negative, were
grouped together in the analysis on the assumption that those tested in hospital were more
likely to have severe disease. Baseline anthropometric measures were collected a median of
10.9 (IQR 9.7-12.4) years before SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted. BMI levels, however,
track well over time; the rank correlation for BMI was r=0.90 in 34, 917 repeat measurements
taken 8.5 years post baseline, suggesting baseline BMI values reliably estimate BMI
variance. We had modest numbers of deaths in subgroups in our analysis, requiring us to

categorise race crudely as white and non-white. Associations with deaths are therefore less
reliable. Whilst we adjusted for deprivation, individuals with higher weights may have had
greater exposure to the virus. However, as excess fat can impair lung and metabolic function,
stresses inflammatory pathways and cardiorenal systems, and promotes thrombotic
responses,1 our findings likely reflect some causal elements. Although not formally tested,
the current data suggest that BMI may be more strongly related to COVID-19 deaths than
SARS-CoV-2 test positivity (Figures 1a-f).
Currently the UK government advises people with BMI>40 to be more stringent at adhering
to non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. physical distancing, hand hygiene etc). Our results
suggest that there is no evidence of a threshold effect at BMI=40, and that risk associations
are linear. Moreover, our findings suggest excess fat may be a stronger risk factor for
susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and severity of resultant COVID-19, including
death related to COVID-19, in non-whites compared to whites. Indeed, the gradients relating
BMI to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity/COVID-19-related death in non-whites are reminiscent
of the much stronger associations between BMI and diabetes associations in non-white
people.4 This suggests, but does not fully prove, metabolic factors may be pertinent to excess
COVID-19 severity in non-white populations, an observation in line with our suggested role
for excess (ectopic) fat in COVID-19 severity.1 The stronger association of BMI with
COVID-19-related death in younger individuals also makes sense given BMI is less precise
measure of excess fat in elderly people due to changes in muscle mass linked to unintentional
weight loss.
When taken in context with other emerging data,2,3,5 our results support the need for public
health campaigns to help and support individuals across different ethnic groups who are
overweight or obese to lose weight to lessen their chances of severe COVID-19. Such advice
may be particularly pertinent to non-white communities. Whilst we lack trial evidence to
prove weight loss lowers risks, there are many additional benefits of weight loss, including
improved cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life. We recognise that not all individuals
are able to lose weight through lifestyle changes; some may require drug therapies, if even
temporarily, to help reduce weight and maybe lower risk.
