Abstract:

30

Introduction

31

Evidence that supports the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for treatment of

32

COVID-19 is increasingly emerging. However, very few African countries have undertaken

33

the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of

34

collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for

35

treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda.

36

Methods

37

In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in

38

Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found

39

eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent.

40

Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was

41

tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers.

42

SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors.

43

Results

44

192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179

45

eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time

46

7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma

47

in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack

48

of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%). The median age was 30 years and

49

females accounted for 3.7% of the donors. A total of 30 (18.5%) donors tested positive for

50

different TTIs. Antibody titer testing demonstrated titers of more than 1:320 for all the 72

51

samples tested. Age greater than 46 years and female gender were associated with higher

52

titers though not statistically significant.

53

Conclusion

54

CCP collection and processing is possible in Uganda. However, concerns about stigma and

55

lack of time, interest or transport need to be addressed in order to maximize donations.

Introduction

58

There have been over 41 million cases of COVID-19 reported, and more than one million

59

deaths recorded (1). In Uganda, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported on 21st

60

March 2020 (2). Up till mid-May, the local COVID-19 epidemic spread at a slow pace and

61

mainly comprised of imported cases, majority of whom were asymptomatic. There were limited

62

foci of transmission with no evidence of community transmission (2). From mid-May to early

63

August, the local epidemic progressed to more foci and clusters of transmission. However,

64

starting from mid-August, there has been a rapid rise in the number of cases detected daily

65

and rapid progression to community transmission and increasing mortality. As of 5th October

66

2020, up to 8,808 cases have been recorded with 81 deaths reported (3).

67
68

Control of COVID-19 in Uganda has been mainly through the non-pharmacologic measures

69

adopted from the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). These

70

measures include use of face masks, social distancing and hand washing or sanitization using

71

alcohol containing sanitizers (4). With no vaccines for COVID-19 available, several

72

repurposed and new drugs have been reported in compassionate use and small trials with

73

mixed benefit (5).

74
75

Evidence is emerging to support the use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) for

76

treatment of COVID-19 especially among patients with severe and critical forms of disease

77

(6–10). Administration of CCP has been found to be safe and associated with clinical,

78

radiological and laboratory improvements as well as reduction in mortality (6,11–14).

79

However, some studies found no benefit of CCP with regard to reducing mortality and or length

80

of hospital stay, improving the day 15 disease free severity or shortening the time to clinical

81

improvement(15,16). One study by Li et al was terminated early due to inability to reach the

82

targeted sample size. Given the mixed and inconsistent nature of findings of CCP use , there

83

is need for more rigorous studies to assess the efficacy of CCP in treatment of COVID 19.

85

To-date, there are few African countries that have undertaken the collection and processing

86

of CCP (17). According to the international society of blood transfusion (ISBT) document

87

library, only South Africa is conducting a CCP trial while Ghana has posted guidelines for

88

collecting, processing, storage and distribution of CCP (18). The slow embracement of CCP

89

is probably due to pre-COVID-19 pandemic challenges to blood transfusion services such as

90

reliance on whole blood transfusions, widespread unavailability of blood component

91

production technology, erratic power supply, inadequate storage capacity, transportation

92

challenges, clinicians’ inexperience in the appropriate use of blood components, and limited

93

financial resources (17).

94
95

With more than 4700 individuals recovering from COVID in Uganda (3), the increasing spread

96

of the virus in the community and occurrence of severe and critical cases, we undertook a

97

study to assess the feasibility of collecting, processing and storing CCP, in preparation for a

98

randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda.

99
100

Methods

101

Design and study site

102

We undertook a cross sectional study of individuals that had been diagnosed with COVID-19

103

and treated in Uganda, and had evidence of recovery (defined as two negative PCR tests

104

performed at least 24 hours apart). The work was undertaken at Mulago National Specialized

105

Hospital, where donor assessment and blood collection were performed. Mulago National

106

Specialized hospital, located in the capital Kampala is the biggest referral hospital in Uganda

107

and offers super specialized services. Whole blood processing to obtain plasma was

108

conducted at the Uganda Blood Transfusion Service (UBTS) blood bank situated 2.5 kms

109

away from the donation centre. UBTS is mandated to provide blood services in the country

110

through donation, processing, storage and distribution of processed blood to all health facilities

111

in the country. As an extra layer of safety for the donated plasma, the plasma was tested for

112

presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus using the RT PCR assay at the Department of Immunology

116

Participants

117

We targeted all individuals with documented recovery from COVID-19 infection who had been

118

managed and discharged at a designated COVID-19 treatment hospital in Uganda. To be

119

eligible, the donor had to provide written informed consent, have documented evidence of

120

SAR-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and

121

recovery defined as two negative RT-PCR tests performed at least 24 hours apart, be at least

122

18 years old and meet all criteria for blood donation as set by Uganda Blood Transfusion

123

Services (UBTS). The UBTS criteria include: age between 17-60 years, weight ³50Kgs, pulse

124

rate of 60-100 beats/minute, temperature of 37±0.4oC, hemoglobin level of 12.5-16g/dl for

125

females and 13.5-17g/dl for males, and last blood donation not less than 3 months and 4

126

months for males and females respectively. We excluded females with previous history of

127

blood transfusion and/or pregnancy as well as participants who had documented evidence of

128

a HIV positive status.

Study Procedures

131

Donor screening and donation

132

Administrative clearance was obtained from the Ministry of Health to access a list of recovered

133

individuals from the COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Uganda. Initial screening for blood

134

donation eligibility was performed by telephone. Screening covered questions on recovery

135

from COVID, age, weight, pregnancy history for females, days since diagnosis, comorbid

136

history and whether the individual would be willing to donate. Eligible and willing donors were

137

invited to the donation centre to complete further assessment for eligibility using the study

138

eligibility criteria and the Uganda blood transfusion screening criteria for community donations.

139

Weight was measured using a bathroom scale (SECA) and blood hemoglobin measured using

140

a hemochromax machine. Up to 450mls of whole blood was collected in a quadruple bag using

141

an automated bio mixer and transported to the blood bank in a cool box at 2-10oC within 8 hrs

142

of collection. Donors were requested to return to the donation centre for their blood grouping

143

results. At this visit, those that had TTIs were counselled and linked to care.

144
145

Plasma separation and storage

146

The LUXOmatic V2 blood separation device(19) was used for automatic extraction of the

147

convalescent plasma. The separator uses a colormatic sensor system for best differentiation

148

between red cells, platelets and plasma. Blood component separation of 2 blood bags could

149

be done simultaneously with high quality of plasma component due to the sensitive sensor

150

system. Up to 200mls of CCP was obtained from each 450mls unit of whole blood, labeled

151

and immediately placed on flat in the freezer at –18oC, in a designated CCP shelf for 30

152

minutes, then stored in a deep freezer at –80oC. All processed CCP units were clearly labelled

153

with an Investigation New product (IND) label. Three 2mls aliquots of plasma were obtained

154

in cryo-vials and stored to permit retrospective determination of the characteristics of an

155

effective product and future investigations.

157
158

Blood grouping and pretesting

159

The Immucor blood grouping Galileo system was used to perform ABO and Rh blood grouping

160

while screening for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) was done using the Abbott

161

Architect i2000 technology. Positive units for TTIs were repeated on Fortress ELISA as per

162

the blood bank testing algorithm. We tested plasma for presence of SARS CoV-2 RNA using

163

the ALTONA RealStar SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (20).

SAR-CoV2 Antibody titer testing

170

Antibody titers were determined using the Acro Biosystems Anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody IgG

171

titer Serological ELISA Assay kit (Spike protein RBD)(21) following the manufacturer’s

172

instructions. The resultant IgG titers (nanograms/milliliter) was converted to arbitrary units by

173

dividing with the concentration (nanograms/milliliter) that corresponded with three times the

174

average optical density (OD) of the negative control samples.

175

Statistical analysis

176

Participants’ characteristics were described using proportions, means (standard deviation-

177

SD), and medians (inter-quartile range-IQR) to describe the. Comparisons of characteristics

178

were done using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables, and t-tests for

179

continuous ones. All analyses were done using STATA® version 15.

180
181

Ethical procedures

182

The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and

183

in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as laid down by the ICH

184

topic E6 (Note for Guidance on GCP). Before initiating the study, ethical approval was

185

obtained from the Mulago Hospital Research and Ethics Committee (MHREC 1872), as well

186

as the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (HS684ES). All participants gave

187

informed written consent, and confidentiality of participants was through use of patient

188

identification numbers instead of names on all study documents and samples. All patient

189

information was kept secure and was only available to the study staff, regulators, and ethics

190

committees.

194

The outcome of donor screening is summarized in figure 1. Up to 192 participants were

195

approached (8 females, 184 males) and of these, 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. The

196

reasons for ineligibility for the 13 (6.8%) participants included: hypertension (23.1%), diabetes

197

(15.4%), hypertension and diabetes (7.7%), HIV (7.7%), HIV and diabetes (7.7%), age below

198

18 years (7.7%), underweight (7.7%) and female with a history of pregnancy (23.1%). Of the

199

179 eligible to donate, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate. Reasons given for their

200

unwillingness to donate included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the

201

COVID-19 treatment center 10(43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1(4.3%), phobia for

202

donating blood 1(4.3%), religious issues 1(4.4%), lack of interest 2(8.7%) and transport

203

challenges 1(4.3%). All eligible individuals were invited to the donation centre for further

204

screening and donation, of whom 123 (78.8%) presented for additional screening. A further

205

63 recovered COVID-19 individuals were self-referred, increasing the total number of

206

participants screened to 186. Of the 186 who came to the donation center, 24(12.9%) were

207

ineligible at time of enrollment due to: high blood pressure (54.2%), HIV positive status (8.3%),

208

HIV positive status and hypertension (4.2%), high temperature (4.2%), previous donation

209

within one month (4.2%), underweight (8.3%), heart disease (4.2%), donation phobia (4.2%),

210

on treatment for peptic ulcer disease (4.2%) and work pressures (4.2%).

Discussion

245

We aimed to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing CCP, in preparation for a

246

randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. We have demonstrated

247

that collection and processing of CCP is feasible and that all the donors have adequate

248

antibody levels.

249
250

More than three quarters (93.2%) of the recovered individuals were found eligible to donate,

251

with up to 87.2% willing to donate. The proportion eligible to donate in our study is higher than

252

was found by Li et al in a pilot program (22). The difference could be attributed to their small

253

sample size and level of screening where the 93.2% in our study was due to telephonic

254

prescreening. The numbers would be expected to drop after following onsite/physical

255

screening as individuals initially cleared as eligible may fail eligibility while at the donation site.

256

It may additionally be due to younger demographics in the present study.

257
258

Donor eligibility and recruitment are an integral part of a successful CCP collection program.

259

We instituted an eligibility criteria as has been recommended previously (23). The eligibility

260

included evidence of a COVID 19 positive test and subsequent proof of recovery as evidenced

261

by a discharge certificate at presentation to the donation centre. Donors for CCP need to

262

satisfy other eligibility for routine donations (24), and thus to ensure deferrals to a minimum,

263

a trained psychologist administered a pre-screening questionnaire by telephone, asking for

264

obvious morbid conditions like HIV, Hepatitis, Hypertension, Diabetes, Syphilis among others.

265
266

In this study, 12.8% of the recovered individuals screened and found eligible to donate opted

267

out for various reasons including stigma. Stigma has previously been identified to affect

268

treatment seeking and also affect the recovered individuals (25–27).

269
270

Transfusion transmissible infections including COVID-19 have been highlighted as a potential

271

challenge to CCP administration especially in low and medium income countries (18). There

272

is no evidence for transmission of COVID-19 through blood donation (28); however, we

273

ensured the donors were clinically and virally free of SARS-CoV-2. We did SARS-CoV-2

274

testing on the nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the donors and further did SARS-CoV-2

275

testing on the plasma and found no RNA in plasma or swabs of the donors. The UBTS did

276

further screening for transfusion transmissible infections (HIV, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B and

277

Syphilis). It has been previously found out that the prevalence of TTIs tends to be lower among

278

repeat donors as repeat donations select healthier individuals (24).

279
280

This study will inform an ongoing clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of CCP. To be

281

able to execute this, antibody titer levels will be key. Analysis on 72 donors revealed they all

282

had sufficient antibody titers in excess of 1:320, consistent with findings from a pilot program

283

in Wuhan China where all the donors had sufficient antibody titers (22). The high levels of

284

antibodies could explain why majority of the Ugandan patients had mild forms of disease and

285

thus were able to mount a good humoral immune response. The high antibody titers could

286

also be explained by the fact that most of the donors were included 28 days post diagnosis.

287

The 28 day period of convalescence has been associated with a high antibody level (29).

288
289

Specimen biobanking is critical in pandemic response, and biospecimen issues have long

290

been appreciated in emergency infectious disease control (30). In this feasibility study, we

have been able to collect, process and store samples from recovered COVID 19 individuals

292

for future research. We shall be able to link this to clinical data and answer any other emerging

293

biomedical questions including monoclonal antibody manufacture.

294
295

Limitations

296

Despite demonstrable feasibility of the collection and processing of CCP, the study had

297

limitations including inability to do apheresis as had originally been planned. This would have

298

allowed us to do more frequent donations from the same donors. We were unable to collect

299

all the needed data from the participants who didn’t donate plasma. This would have given us

300

an opportunity to compare the successful donors and the those that were screened out. We

301

were also unable to do pathogen inactivation as is usually recommended for CCP.

302
303

Conclusion

304

In our experience, CCP collection, processing and storage is possible in Uganda and should

305

be possible in most low and middle income countries (LMICs) with functional national blood

306

transfusion services. However, concerns about stigma and lack of time, interest or transport

307

need to be addressed in order to maximize donations.
