Abstract:

Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) represent the primary mitigation strategy for

pandemic COVID-19. Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general
public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs
regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and explore associations between
NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a crosssectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005
respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI
0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would

not reduce their personal risk of illness.

Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with
30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On
univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs
would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and
with a belief that the NPIs were

not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31],

p<0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged
NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face
touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently.
NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are
effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings
have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility,
as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.

Introduction
Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have emerged as a first line of protection and
mitigation in the face of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly given evidence suggesting

1,2

the efficacy of such interventions in previous pandemics.

Since modern NPIs were adopted

over a century ago during the 1918-1919 flu pandemic, much of the public debate has
remained unchanged, centering on the efficacy and burdensomeness of NPIs, and their

3,4

potential for broader effects on morale and economic stability.

5,6

Few studies have evaluated public perceptions of NPIs in the context of influenza pandemics,
and none have addressed this issue in the context of the present COVID-19 pandemic.

Pandemic responsiveness is contingent on individuals eschewing their normal daily behaviors;
thus a small number of refusers may drive—and social media may further exacerbate—such
behaviors. Some have suggested that NPI adherence is improved with improved

7

communication; that is, NPI non-adherence is a function of a knowledge gap.

Yet data from

behavioral research suggests that non-compliance with expert recommendations is generally

not a function of a lack of knowledge per se.8-10

Understanding whether outcome expectations (a perception of

efficacy) affects NPI adherence

is critical; if there is a knowledge gap in appreciating that NPIs are effective, it could be
addressed through outreach efforts. Conversely, if NPI non-adherence is a function of process
expectations (concerns that performing NPIs is too

onerous), then outreach efforts could be

focused on mitigating these perceptions rather than highlighting the potential to reduce
disease spread.

We therefore sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and selfreported adoption of NPIs, and explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline
characteristics of respondents. These data may help inform public health efforts, as better
understanding the drivers of refusal to engage in NPIs will help tailor messaging appropriately
and ideally increase the chances of encouraging behavioral changes that may ultimately result
in reduced disease transmission.

Methods
We developed a cross-sectional online survey of the general US population after iterative pilot
testing. This study was deemed exempt by the Ascension Health institutional review board. The
survey was prepared on the Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics Corp, Provo, Utah) and distributed to
a representative US sample stratified by age, sex, and race, through Prolific Academic (Oxford,

11

United Kingdom), a platform for academic survey research.

Respondents were rewarded with

a small payment (<US$1). Subjects provided consent and were allowed to terminate the survey
at any time, and all responses were confidential.

Baseline responses to survey questions were recorded (Supplemental file), and demographic
information was self-reported by respondents. Responses to a range of questions regarding
attitudes to the COVID-19 pandemic, fears, worry, and NPI beliefs and actions were collected
using Likert scales.

T-tests and chi-squared tests were used as appropriate for baseline continuous and categorical
variables. Subgroup comparisons of non-normally distributed data were performed using the
Kruskal Wallis test. Univariate logistic regression odds ratios of association were assessed
between the dependent variable of NPI adherence, defined as those who engaged, on average,
in each NPI always or most of the time, and baseline characteristics and attitudes. Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata 13 for Mac (College Station, Texas).

Results
Of the 1,020 subjects who were recruited, 1,005 finished the survey, yielding a completion rate
of 98.5%. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 45 (16), and 494 (48.8%) of the respondents
were male; baseline respondent characteristics are outlined in Table 1.

More than 90% of subjects reported using several common NPIs all or most of the time (Table
2). Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use,
with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread.
Overall, 37% (34.0, 39.9) of respondents felt that NPIs in general were inconvenient, while only
0.9% (0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs in general would

not reduce their personal

risk of illness.

On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs
would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and
with a belief that the NPIs were

not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31],

p<0.0001). Adherence was also associated with self-described religiosity (OR 1.85, 95% CI
[1.42, 2.39], p<0.0001); full-time employment (OR 1.35, 95% CI [1.02, 1.78], p=0.035); worry
regarding a family member contracting COVID-19 (OR 1.47, 95% CI [1.11, 1.93], p=0.007); and
belief that the media was

not exaggerating the severity of the pandemic (OR 1.44, 95% CI [1.09,

1.91], p=0.012).

Discussion
Most respondents stated that they are performing key NPIs, such as hand washing and social
distancing, on a consistent basis, and the majority of respondents agreed that NPIs are effective
in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Mask wearing and eye protection adherence and perceived
efficacy lag behind other NPIs; this may be due to messaging, since at the time the survey was
performed no recommendations were in place to encourage mask or face protection by the

12

general public in the US. While some have questioned the effectiveness of school closures,

it

is important to maintain consistent messaging for the general public, particularly since the
scientific consensus is that NPIs are effective overall.

2,5,6

This is particularly important since

beyond belief in efficacy, emotional appeals may be important in encouraging appropriate

13

behaviors.

Not surprisingly, those who believe that NPI use is not at all inconvenient are more

likely to engage in NPI use, as are those that believe in the efficacy of NPIs in reducing personal
risk of COVID-19 infection. Our single study incudes approximately the same number of subjects
as all 16 studies included in a recent systematic review of influenza pandemic beliefs.

Limitations of this survey-based study include generalizability, mitigated in part by the stratified
sampling and large survey panel design; response and social desirability biases, the latter
reduced by the anonymous nature of the survey; and the inability to draw causal inferences
from a cross-sectional investigation.

These data highlight potential targets for public health efforts: respondents were compliant
with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as handwashing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and
wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. These findings are consistent with
previous research on NPIs for pandemic influenza.

Changes in CDC recommendations for

mask/ face coverings may impact these behaviors in the future.

An improved understanding of the drivers of refusal to engage in NPIs may help tailor
messaging and increase the chances of eliciting behavioral change. NPI non-adherence is
