Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disproportionately results in hospitalization
and death in older patients and those with underlying comorbidities. Sotrovimab is a pansarbecovirus monoclonal antibody designed to treat such high-risk patients early in the course of
disease, thereby preventing Covid-19 progression.
Methods: In this ongoing, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, nonhospitalized patients with
symptomatic Covid-19 and at least one risk factor for disease progression were randomized (1:1)
to an intravenous infusion of sotrovimab 500 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was
the proportion of patients with Covid-19 progression, defined as hospitalization longer than 24
hours or death, through day 29.
Results: In this preplanned interim analysis, which included an intent-to-treat population of 583
patients (sotrovimab, 291; placebo, 292), the primary efficacy endpoint was met. The risk of
Covid-19 progression was significantly reduced by 85% (97.24% confidence interval, 44% to
96%; P = 0.002) with a total of three (1%) patients progressing to the primary endpoint in the
sotrovimab group versus 21 (7%) patients in the placebo group. All five patients admitted to
intensive care, including one who died by day 29, received placebo. Safety was assessed in 868
patients (sotrovimab, 430; placebo, 438). Adverse events were reported by 17% and 19% of
patients receiving sotrovimab and placebo, respectively; serious adverse events were less
common with sotrovimab (2%) versus placebo (6%).
Conclusion: Sotrovimab reduced progression of Covid-19 in patients with mild/moderate
disease, was well tolerated, and no safety signals were identified.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) global pandemic is estimated to have killed over 3
million individuals worldwide.1 In the United States alone, there were an estimated 960,000 to
2.4 million hospitalizations through Fall 2020 and, at the peak of the pandemic in January 2021,
79% of intensive care hospital beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients.1-3 Older patients and
those with certain comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary diseases,
and chronic kidney disease, have been identified as those at highest risk of hospitalization or
death.4-8

Highly effective therapeutics directed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes Covid-19, are urgently needed for these high-risk
individuals. Recent data suggest that one option is monoclonal antibody therapy, which can
reduce the risk of hospitalization9,10; however, the emergence and proliferation of SARS-CoV-2
variants conferring resistance to some antibodies is deeply concerning.11,12 Furthermore, as
additional variants of concern will likely continue to emerge, there is a high unmet medical need
for therapeutics that, alone or in combination, can remain effective as the virus evolves. A
monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by targeting an evolutionarily conserved
epitope that lies outside the rapidly evolving receptor-binding motif is one possible solution—it
would have an intrinsically higher barrier to resistance and, due to its nonoverlapping resistance
profile, could be combined with receptor-binding motif–targeted antibodies when necessary to
further heighten the barrier to resistance.

Sotrovimab, formerly known as VIR-7831, is an engineered human monoclonal antibody that
neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and multiple other sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV, the virus
responsible for the SARS outbreak two decades ago.13 In fact, the parental form of sotrovimab,
S309, was isolated from a SARS survivor.13 We hypothesized that a monoclonal antibody that
neutralizes all sarbecoviruses would target a highly conserved epitope that would be functionally
retained as SARS-CoV-2 evolves (Fig. 1). Consistent with this hypothesis, we subsequently
demonstrated that, in vitro, sotrovimab retains activity against now widespread SARS-CoV-2
variants that were first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351),
Brazil (P.1), and California (B.1.427/B.1.429).11,14,15 In contrast, many of the other monoclonal
antibodies being developed for Covid-19 bind to the receptor-binding motif that engages the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is one of the most mutable and
immunogenic regions of the virus; in some cases, these antibodies do not retain activity against
the variants.16-19

Sotrovimab contains a two–amino acid Fc modification (termed LS) to increase half-life and
potentially improve bioavailability in the respiratory mucosa through enhanced engagement with
the neonatal Fc receptor.20-22 This modification potentially allows therapeutic concentrations for
longer durations.20-22 Sotrovimab has demonstrated potent effector functions in vitro, which have
the potential to result in immune-mediated viral clearance.13,14

Here, we report the results from a preplanned interim analysis of the COvid-19 Monoclonal
antibody Efficacy Trial-Intent to Care Early (COMET-ICE) study evaluating the efficacy and
safety of treatment with sotrovimab in high-risk, ambulatory patients with mild/moderate Covid19. The trial is currently closed for enrollment; data collection is ongoing. Additional efficacy,
safety, and laboratory data, as well as initial immunogenicity data, will be reported subsequently.

Methods
Trial Objectives and Oversight
This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study is evaluating a
single intravenous infusion of sotrovimab 500 mg for the prevention of progression of
mild/moderate Covid-19 in high-risk, nonhospitalized patients. For this preplanned interim
analysis, patients were recruited beginning on August 27, 2020 and followed through March 4,
2021 at 37 study sites in four countries (United States, Canada, Brazil, and Spain). Changes
made to the protocol and statistical analysis plan after the trial started are summarized in the
Supplementary Appendix.

This study is sponsored by Vir Biotechnology, Inc., in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. It is
being conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for
International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, applicable
International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable laws
and regulations. All patients provided written informed consent. The Sponsors designed the trial,

and the Sponsors and trial investigators participated in data collection, analysis, and
interpretation.

Patients and Procedures
Adult patients 18 years of age or older with a positive reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chainreaction or antigen SARS-CoV-2 test result and onset of symptoms within the prior 5 days were
screened for eligibility; screening was performed within 24 hours before study drug
administration. Patients were required to be at high risk for Covid-19 progression, defined as
older adults (age ≥55 years) or adults with at least one of the following risk factors: diabetes
requiring medication, obesity (body-mass index >30 kg/m2), chronic kidney disease (estimated
glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2),23 congestive heart failure (New York Heart
Association class II or higher), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and moderate to severe
asthma.24 Patients with already severe Covid-19, defined by shortness of breath at rest,
respiratory distress, or requiring supplemental oxygen, were excluded. Full inclusion and
exclusion criteria are described in the Supplementary Appendix.

Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 using an interactive web response system to receive either
a single 500-mg, 1-hour infusion of sotrovimab or equal volume saline placebo on day 1 (Fig. 2).

Efficacy Assessments
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with hospitalization for more than 24 hours
or death, due to any cause, through day 29. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the proportion
of patients with an emergency room visit, hospitalization, or death; mortality; patient-reported
outcomes; changes in viral load; and the proportion of patients who progressed to require
supplemental oxygen.

Safety Assessments
Safety endpoints included adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events of special
interest, defined as infusion-related reactions (including hypersensitivity reactions),
immunogenicity testing for anti-drug antibodies, and evaluation of antibody-dependent
enhancement. All hospitalizations, including those due to Covid-19, were counted as serious
adverse events.

Statistical Analyses
A preplanned interim analysis for safety, futility, and profound efficacy was triggered when
approximately 41% of the required number of study patients reached day 29. Sample size
calculations were based on a group sequential design with two interim analyses to assess both
futility due to lack of efficacy or profound efficacy. A Lan-DeMets alpha spending function to
control type I error was used, employing a Pocock analog rule for futility and a Hwang-ShihDeCani (with parameter γ = 1) analog for efficacy.25 The overall sample size of 1360 would have

provided approximately 90% power to detect a 37.5% relative efficacy in reducing progression
of Covid-19 through day 29 at the overall two-sided 5% significance level, with an assumed
progression rate of 16% in the placebo group.

The interim analysis intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients through
the prespecified interim analysis cutoff date of January 19, 2021, irrespective of whether they
received study drug. The interim analysis safety analysis population included all patients who
received study medication and were randomized through February 17, 2021; patients were
grouped according to the actual treatment received. The primary endpoint was analyzed in the
ITT population using a Poisson regression model with robust sandwich estimators adjusting for
treatment, duration of symptoms, age, and gender. Missing progression status was imputed under
a missing at random assumption, using multiple imputation. Based on this analysis model, the
statistical significance testing, the relative risk of progression, and its appropriate confidence
interval (CI) are provided using the adjusted significance level for this interim analysis.

As a result of profound efficacy, an independent data monitoring committee recommended that
enrollment in the study be stopped on March 10, 2021, at which time 1057 patients had been
randomized. Analyses of all secondary and exploratory endpoints will be conducted when all
patients have completed day 29.

Results
Patients
Of 795 patients screened, 583 were randomized through January 19, 2021 to sotrovimab (291
patients) or placebo (292 patients); these patients comprise the interim analysis ITT population
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In this ITT population, similar disposition was
observed across treatment groups. Overall, four patients each in the sotrovimab and placebo
groups withdrew from the study. Three patients in the sotrovimab group withdrew prior to
dosing, with a fourth patient withdrawing consent on day 5 for personal reasons. One patient in
the placebo group withdrew consent prior to dosing, and three patients withdrew after dosing for
personal reasons (days 16, 25, and 85). The median duration of follow-up in the ITT population
was 72 days (range, 5 to 190) for the sotrovimab group and 72 days (range, 16 to 190) for the
placebo group.

Overall, 868 patients (sotrovimab, 430 patients; placebo, 438 patients) were randomized and
received study drug through February 17, 2021; these patients comprise the interim analysis
safety analysis population. The median duration of follow-up in this population was 56 days
(range, 5 to 190) for the sotrovimab group and 55 days (range, 2 to 190) for the placebo group.

Treatment groups in the ITT population were well balanced for baseline demographic and
disease characteristics (Table 1). Overall, 22% of patients were greater than 65 years of age, 7%
were Black or African American, 63% were Hispanic or Latino, and 42% had two or more

conditions considered to be risk factors for Covid-19 progression. The most common risk factors
were obesity, age 55 years or older, and diabetes requiring medication. The most common
presenting symptoms (>60% of all patients) were cough, muscle aches/myalgia, headache, and
fatigue (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Baseline demographic and disease
characteristics in the safety analysis population were similar across treatment groups and are
reported in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.

Efficacy Outcomes
Treatment with sotrovimab resulted in an 85% reduction in the need for hospitalization over 24
hours or death, due to any cause, compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.15 [97.24% CI, 0.04 to
0.56]). Three (1%) patients progressed to the primary endpoint in the sotrovimab group versus 21
(7%) patients in the placebo group (P = 0.002) (Table 2). The primary reasons for the 24
hospitalizations of more than 24 hours were consistent with progressive Covid-19 (Table S3 in
the Supplementary Appendix), with one likely exception: a patient in the sotrovimab group, with
a notable past medical history of small intestinal obstruction, presented 22 days after infusion
with a small intestinal obstruction. Regarding the severity of these hospitalizations, all five
patients who required admission to intensive care were in the placebo group; two of these five
patients required invasive mechanical ventilation and a third declined intubation and
subsequently died by day 29. Emergency room visits or hospitalizations for less than 24 hours
were observed in fewer patients in the sotrovimab group compared with the placebo group
(Table 2).

Safety
The proportion of patients in the safety analysis population who reported an adverse event was
17% (73 of 430 patients) in the sotrovimab group and 19% (85 of 438 patients) in the placebo
group (Table 3). A lower proportion of patients reported grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the
sotrovimab group (2%) compared with the placebo group (6%). Overall, the only adverse event
occurring in at least 1% of patients receiving sotrovimab was diarrhea, which occurred
infrequently—six (1%) patients in the sotrovimab group versus three (<1%) patients in the
placebo group. Among patients in the sotrovimab group, all cases of diarrhea were mild (five
patients) or moderate (one patient) in severity.

Infusion-related reactions were observed in a similar proportion of patients receiving sotrovimab
(1%) compared with placebo (1%). One patient receiving sotrovimab had an infusion-related
reaction that was considered related to study treatment: moderate (grade 2) dyspnea.

Serious adverse events occurred in 2% of patients receiving sotrovimab and 6% of patients
receiving placebo. Most of these events were hospitalizations due to Covid-19–related causes.
No serious adverse events were considered related to sotrovimab. One patient in the placebo
group died after day 29; this patient died due to Covid-19 pneumonia on day 37.

No trends were observed in hematologic, liver, or chemistry laboratory data. Overall, laboratory
results were similar in the sotrovimab and placebo groups.

Discussion
In this preplanned interim analysis of the COMET-ICE study, a single 500-mg dose of
sotrovimab profoundly reduced the risk of hospitalization (>24 hours) or death in high-risk
adults with symptomatic Covid-19 by 85% compared with placebo (P = 0.002). For every 17
high-risk patients with symptomatic Covid-19, sotrovimab prevented one hospitalization.
Importantly, among those who were hospitalized, no patient who received sotrovimab required
admission to intensive care compared with five patients who received placebo, suggesting that
sotrovimab may also prevent more severe complications of Covid-19 in addition to preventing
the need for hospitalization itself. Furthermore, as a result of investigator site selection, over
60% of the study population consisted of patients self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino; thus,
this trial is one of the first to demonstrate efficacy in a population that has been largely
underrepresented in Covid-19 clinical trials, despite the disproportionately negative impact the
pandemic has had in this ethnic group. Overall, sotrovimab was well tolerated, and no safety
signals were identified in this study. There was also no evidence of antibody-dependent
enhancement with sotrovimab, which would have manifested as worsening of disease compared
with placebo.26

Sotrovimab is thus a potentially critical therapeutic in the fight against Covid-19, for which there
remains a high unmet medical need despite the recent success of preventative measures, such as
vaccines. Challenges with access to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, medical contraindications to
vaccines, immunocompromised individuals who may not respond to a vaccine, and most
importantly, the potential emergence of variant viruses that escape vaccine-derived immunity,
will all contribute to what is likely to be an unfortunately large and enduring number of Covid-19
cases in need of treatment.

Importantly, treatments for Covid-19 will need to retain activity even in the face of a rapidly
evolving virus. To that end, sotrovimab was selected to have an intrinsically high barrier to
resistance as a result of targeting a pan-sarbecovirus epitope.14 In one analysis, among more than
584,000 sequences in the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System database (Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data), amino acid positions comprising the sotrovimab
epitope were at least 99.96% conserved in naturally occurring viruses.14 Moreover, when
necessary to further enhance breadth and barrier to resistance, sotrovimab can likely be
combined with currently authorized receptor-binding motif–targeted antibodies due to its
nonoverlapping resistance profile.

This interim report has three major limitations. First, with only three hospitalizations in the
sotrovimab group, it is not possible to determine which patient or disease characteristics might
be associated with sotrovimab treatment failure. Second, the safety dataset was moderate in size

(430 patients) and thus a rare (much less than 1%) adverse event may not have been observed,
though one would not be expected as sotrovimab was derived from an antibody isolated from a
recovered SARS-CoV patient, has minimal engineering, and targets a viral epitope (not a host
epitope). Third, secondary and exploratory endpoint analyses are excluded from this interim
report since the study is ongoing; such analyses are needed to further determine the potential
additional benefits of sotrovimab.

This study has two key scientific and medical ramifications, beyond demonstrating the
therapeutic value of sotrovimab. First, the results indicate that a non–receptor-binding motif
binding antibody, which does not directly block the ACE2 receptor interaction, can be clinically
therapeutic, and suggests a role for other receptors.27 Second, as sotrovimab has potent effector
function, the absence of safety signals and profound efficacy strongly suggest that effector
function is neither detrimental nor associated with antibody-dependent enhancement.26 In fact,
preclinical models of Covid-19 suggest that its potent effector function may be beneficial.13,14

In conclusion, results from this interim analysis of the COMET-ICE trial strongly support that
sotrovimab can be an important therapeutic for the outpatient treatment of Covid-19. Notably, a
500-mg dose may also enable intramuscular administration, increasing the convenience of and
access to antibody therapeutics for patients with Covid-19. Studies are currently underway to
evaluate this route of administration. Importantly, as a component of a comprehensive pandemic

*Relatedness was determined by individual study investigators while blinded to study treatment.
†A patient was permanently discontinued from the completion of drug infusion if they
experienced life-threatening infusion-related reactions, including severe allergic or
hypersensitivity reactions during the intravenous infusion.
‡For both patients, the adverse event was infusion extravasation; both infusions were completed.
§Infusion-related reactions were defined as adverse events with preferred terms of pyrexia,
chills, dizziness, dyspnea, pruritus, rash, and infusion-related reaction within 24 hours of study
drug administration.
¶In addition to the patient in the placebo group who died by day 29, another patient in the
placebo group died due to Covid-19 pneumonia on day 37; this patient was admitted to the
hospital prior to day 29 and was thus considered to have met the primary endpoint definition of
Covid-19 progression.
