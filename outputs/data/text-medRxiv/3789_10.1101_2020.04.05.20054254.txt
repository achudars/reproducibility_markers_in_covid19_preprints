ABSTRACT
Background
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly around
the globe during the past 3 months. As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing
exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along
with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent
requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods and findings
We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate
clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols
regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited
time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning
(ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using
ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naïve
Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of
COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among
all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID – DB01072) would probably be one of the most
effective drugs based on the selected criterions.
Conclusions
Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing
strategy for community applications.

Introduction
The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now considered to be a pandemic threat to the global
population[1–3]. Coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses mainly found in animals but with the recent outbreak, they
have transmitted to humans. The new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV is termed as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2[4–9] which has now affected more than 200 countries with over 17,83,941 cases confirmed
and 1,09,312 deaths reported all over the world [as on 12 April 2020]. This could potentially bring major challenges to
global healthcare and disastrous effect on the global economy if the virus is not contained within a few months[10]. The
common symptoms include cough, fever, shortness of breath, fatigue etc which makes it confusing for the patients to
differentiate the symptoms with that of the typical cold and flu[10–13]. Reports suggest that the virus is transmitted
through body fluids of the infected patients, especially when in contact and while sneezing even though exact reasons
are not known. Unfortunately, no drugs have been approved by regulatory agencies to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection until
now. Efforts are ongoing on war footing to find the effective drug and vaccine to treat this pandemic.
Coronaviruses are classified into four classes designated as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta[14]. The betacoronavirus
class includes severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERSCoV), and the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses are found to be considerably large viruses with a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome encapsulated inside a membrane envelope having proteins apprearing like spikes
protruding from their surface. These spikes adheres onto human cells, through certain receptors on target cells, after
which undergoes a structural change that lets the viral membrane fuse with the cell membrane. The viral genes then
enter the host cell, producing more viruses. Recent studies show that, like the virus responsible for 2002 SARS outbreak,
SARS-CoV-2 spikes also bind to receptors on the human cell surface called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)[15]. Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also attacks the lower respiratory system causing viral
pneumonia. However, there are also reports that it could affect the gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and
central nervous system resulting in multiple organ failure[16]. Compiling the medical reports and data available from
the patients, SARSCoV-2 is found to be more transmissible/contagious than SARS-CoV[17].
Rapid development of computer aided technology like ML based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help accelerate the
drug development process for different diseases[18–20]. The advantage of AI approaches like ML is that they can be
applied to learn from examples and build predictive models even when our understanding of the underlying biological
processes is limited, or when computational simulations based on fundamental physical models are too expensive to be
carried away. Another advantage of ML is to automatically learn to identify complex patterns that categorize sets from

input data and thereby make intelligent decisions based on independent datasets[21]. ML can accurately predict drugtarget interactions as an enormous amount of complex information by studying hydrophobic interactions, ionic
interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, etc. between molecules. Bioactivity datasets which are available
from the numerous high throughput screens deliver useful means for machine learning classifiers as they contain binary
information (active/inactive) as well as numerical values to classify different compounds under consideration[22,23].
Such a huge number of datasets available on biological activities of molecules, derived from high throughput screens
now allows to create predictive computational models.
In this study, we have applied a machine learning approach to predict several new potential drugs for the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 and validated the predicted drugs. Initially, we have trained our model with the inhibitors of the SARS
Coronavirus 3C-like Protease. The FDA approved drugs are only taken from the Drug bank as a test model to predict
the new drugs. These new drugs are again validated using a docking method to ensure that the drugs match with the
same active site on the protein. A ranked list of drugs based on energy value is given that can be tested experimentally.
Our study hypothesizes that the commercial FDA approved antiretroviral drug Atazanavir may be a potential candidate
requiring to limit viral recognition of host cells or disrupt host-virus interactions thus requiring further clinical trial.

Methods
Preparation of Dataset
In the present study, the compounds of the dataset are tested in the cell based system using plate readers and then their
results are stored as Bioassay Dataset in the Pub chem. This dataset of PubChem Bioassay assigned AID 1706 contains
around 290893 compounds as one activity set and they are the inhibitors of SARS coronavirus 3C-like Protease in the
cells. This dataset is stored in the section Bioassay of PubChem database of National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI), and they have the identification AID number as AID 1706[23]. This corresponding bioassay
belongs to the Scripps Research Institute Molecular Screening Center of replication in SARS coronavirus 3C-like
Protease in the cells. The compounds are classified under three distinct categories as actives, inactives and inconclusive.
Compounds that inhibit luminescence activity may kill SARS coronavirus, inhibit SARS coronavirus invasion or inhibit
development of the parasite within the host cell and hence these are classified under the active section and the
compounds which do not show effectiveness are classified under inactive section. These complete datasets were
downloaded in the form of SDF (Structure Data File) from the PubChem Database.
The Drug Bank is an online database which contains detailed data about various medications[25]. Today, it is being
widely used to facilitate in silico drug target discovery, drug design, drug docking or screening, drug metabolism

prediction, drug interaction prediction and for general pharmaceutical education. This database of more than 4900 Drugs
is categorized into many different types as Trial stages Drugs, Approved Drugs and Withdrawn Drugs. In this database,
more than 45% of drugs are approved for various medication purposes[25]. In this research, we have focused only on
the FDA approved drugs for repurposing purpose which are around 2388 with the intention that it will minimize clinical
trial in the present situation. These drugs were downloaded in the form of SDFs and after processing, the descriptions
generated were taken as the test model for developing the train model which was made on the basis of a database
containing the inhibitors of the SARS coronavirus. The developed model has predicted few of the potential drugs.
The NCBI Protein Database was used in the process of getting the FASTA sequence of the desired protein (SARS
coronavirus). Further, the FASTA sequence is used for the modeling of the three-dimensional protein structure and on
the basis of this structure the docking of the known and predicted drugs have been carried out[26].
Processing Dataset
Since the datasets are present in the form of SDFs, we have generated the attributes present in the SDFs. First, the
information present in the SDFs are generated as CSV files which are used as the training dataset and test dataset for
preparing the ML models. These CSV files containing both the actives and inactive points are split into 80% as training
dataset and 20% as test dataset. This entire splitting process was random. This process is done by self-written python
code to split as per the conditions.

Classification Algorithm

We have used Machine learning (ML) model to the selected dataset from the PubChem which was considered as
inhibitors and tested against the drugs from the Drug Bank to find more suitable drugs for the CoronaVirus-19[27].
Using ML, we have implemented the classification algorithms as described below.

The classification is a type of supervised learning in which the computer system can learn from the dataset which
contains the detail and practical results. The algorithmic procedure of the classification is to assign an input value
according to the description in the datasets[28] . So, for this, it requires a mathematical classifier that can assign specific
class (active and inactive) labels to instances defined by the attributes. In this process, the training model is made to
learn using dataset where the classification is already assigned and on the basis of which it is able to run on different
datasets to classify them according to the present instances. In this study, we have compared the results from the
classifier that is Naïve Bayes classification algorithm.
Naive Bayesian classification algorithm is a simple and elegant approach by assuming that its classification attributes
are independent and they don't have any correlation with each other[29]. It is a type of classifier that depends on Bayes'

hypothesis. Naive Bayes does work best in two cases: complete independent feature (as expected) and functionally
dependent features (as expected) and is a widely tested method for probabilistic induction. This classifier functions well
and has advantages over many other induction algorithms. It has no entangled iterative parameter that makes it work for
vast data sets.
This algorithm is more useful than any other induction algorithms because of its computation speed and reliability. It
can be useful for both the binary classification as well as multi-classification 29.

Training Model
The training model is prepared by 80% of the original dataset. The dataset is completely classified from where the
computer learns and finds the relations among various attributes. The cross-validation is used along with the algorithm
to train the model. In this case, the cross-validation is n set with n-folds dataset. Then it is supposed to divide the training
dataset into n parts, and the n-1 parts will be used as training data and the other one will be used to validate the rest.
This process of iteration goes on for n iteration times. Here, we have used 10-fold and it is chosen as per the size of the
dataset[30,31].
Generally, the datasets containing binary classification based on several attributes are imbalanced. We observe the
similar tred here. These imbalanced datasets are not possible to be handled by the normal classifiers since they give
importance to each of the attributes equally which could lead to misclassification errors. This can decrease the accuracy
of the dataset for the trained model[32,33]. Therefore, we have used the misclassification cost where the trained model
becomes cost sensitive and able to find the lowest expected cost. This approach is actually much randomized because it
neither depends upon the number of attributes nor on the minority class ration; rather it depends on the base
classifier[34,35].
Here, we had two methods to introduce the misclassification cost with the imbalance dataset. The first method is to
classify the algorithm into the cost-sensitive one and proceed with the rest settings[36]. The other is the use of a wrapper,
which helps in the base classifiers into cost sensitive ones.
We have used Naïve Bayes classifier which uses the cost insensitive algorithm to predict the probability estimations of
the test instances and then using this it predicts class labels for the examples of the test dataset. In our report, we have
classified our datasets into two classes i.e. active and inactive. So, we used the 2X2 matrix which is generally used for
the binary classification. In the matrix sections are True Positives (active classified as active), False Positives (Inactive
classified as active), False Negatives (active classified as inactive) and True Negatives (inactive classified as inactive).
In this case, the percent of False Negatives are more important than the percent of False Positives and the upper limit

for False Positives were set to 20%[32,36]. In this process, we increase the misclassification up to the set percent which
also helps in the increasing of the True Positives.
Since, the actives are very less in number, we have replicated them to around 100-110 times to match it with the inactives
and make the model less biased.

Independent Validation
There are various methods for the validation of the binary classifiers. The True Positive Rate is the ratio of the actual
actives to the predicted positives and this can be obtained as (TP/TP+FN). The False Positive Rate is the ratio of the
predicted false actives to actual inactives and this can be obtained as (FP/TN+FP). Accuracy shows the model’s
performance relative to the real values and this can be calculated as (TN+TP/TN+TP+FP+FN). The Sensitivity shows
the model’s ability to identify the positive results and this is calculated as (TP/FN+TP) and the Specificity shows the
model’s ability to identify the negative results and this is calculated as (TN/TN+FP). A model with high specificity and
sensitivity has a low error rate. The Balanced Classification Rate (BCR) is the mean of the sensitivity and specificity,
which provides the accuracy of the model applied on the imbalanced dataset. This BCR can be calculated as
0.5*(specificity+sensitivity).
Apart from the BCR, the Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is also used whose range varies from -1 to 1. The
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is the visualization of the ratio of FPR to TPR. In this case, the FPR and
TPR are placed on the x- and y-axis respectivel. The Area under curve shows the probability prediction of the classifier
and its ability to classify the randomly chosen instance into the correct class.

Docking of the Predicted Drugs
Around 178 drugs were predicted by our ML model which can be effective for the treatment of diseases caused by
SARS-Cov-2. There are no available drugs as of now, since the epidemic has just recently accelerated to over 12,18,991
cases [As of 5th April, 2020].
The predicted compounds with above 95% of confidence were docked using patchdock web server.

Results
Here, we have at first taken the inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2, which doesn’t allow them to replicate in the host. These are
screened and collected in the bioassay AID 1706 which were used as the main component for the modeling of the
training model using ML. The 914 attributes were taken under consideration for more than 200,000 compounds. We
have not used unsupervised learning to filter out the dataset, because it would have made the dataset much weaker. As
mentioned in the method section, we have used a classifying algorithm to train the model and the best among them was

further used for the testing and predicting the drugs from the Drug Bank. The schematic of the process is shown in
Figure 1.
We have used the Naïve Bayes against the dataset. It has shown accuracy of approximately 72.999%. With this model,
we have used the drugs from the Drug Bank to get predicted for the identification of the potential drugs which can be
used for the treatment of disease caused by SARS coronavirus. Along with that the model has predicted 34754 True
Positives and 3904 True Negatives.

Figure 1: Flowchart of the process

The Naive Bayes has 0.194 MCC and BCR i.e., 76.69%. As per the independent validation, the algorithm with the
lowest possible False Positives and highest possible True Positives can be considered to be the most effective model for
the prediction of the drugs from the Drug Bank. In all the cases, the compounds for the False Positives were set to 23%.
The comparison of the False Positive Rate and True Positive Rate for all algorithms used in the case of preparation of
ML models are shown in Figure 2. When these results are compared with the rest of the dataset, it is found to be way

better because it has satisfied both criteria and the rest of the algorithms has not reached the mark that has been achieved
by Naive Bayes.
The model created with Naive Bayes algorithm predicted around 471 drugs out of all the 2388 approved drugs. These
471 drugs contain all the drugs which may be for the treatment of disease caused by SARS coronavirus-19. Here, we
have predicted several drugs and out of which, we have docked and suggested the top 10 of them keeping align both the
ML accuracy and the docking result. The docking results have been used for binding energy prediction and its
effectiveness to bind with the compound. The results are shown in Table 1.

Figure 3: (a) Solution model showing Protein-ligand docking, (b) ligplot analysis showing possible bonds between
protein and ligand.

The PDB structure of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was retrieved from Protein data bank (PDB ID: 3VB7). Intitially,
the strcute was optimized by removing water moplecules and other ligand. All the ligands structrure were retrived
from pubchem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The docking experiment was done with the patchdock server (
https://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/). The results refinement and energy calculation was performed as per the
algorithm used in the Firedock server. In server, the final ranking was performed to identify the near-native refined
solution. The ranking was based on various binding energy function that includes a variety of energy terms: van der
Waals interactions, partial electrostatics, desolvation energy (atomic contact energy, ACE), hydrogen and disulfide
bonds, p-stacking and aliphatic interactions and rotamer’s probabilities[24]. The result having minimum global energy
was taken into consideration. Out of all 10 drugs predicted, Atazanavir (DrugBank ID – DB01072) (Figure 3a) has
shown the minimum global energy. To acess the ligplots and detailed protein interactions, the solution were further
analysed with PDBsum (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgibin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=index.html) Figure 3b shows the ligplot analysis having conventional H-bonding
between ligand and protein and 158 various non-bonded contacts and interctions. One H-bond was observed between
Lys (12) A of the protein & O22 of the ligand. Similarly, the second one was between Lys(97)B & O7. These H-bonds
favoured a strong bonding betwwen the two moieties. The bond lengths of the above two H-bonds are 3.07Å and
2.18Å respectively.

Discussion:
In our study, we have taken those drugs for docking purpose which show protease inhibition activity. The docking of
SARS protein with the approved drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID – DB01072), has a global energy of around -59.90
Kcal/mol which confirms that it had numerous steric clashes with the adjoining strands and thus highlight its potential
to inhibit novel SARS coronavirus. Atazanavir is a small molecule antiretroviral drug (Figure 2b), usually sold under
the brand names Invirase and Fortovase, used together with other medications to treat or prevent HIV/AIDS. It is an
HIV protease inhibitor which acts as an analog of an HIV protease cleavage site. It is a highly specific inhibitor of HIV1 and HIV-2 proteases.

protease inhibition [Supplementary Information Figure S1-S9]. With reference to that, we have found that the other
drugs predicted by the model with the inclusion of all the parameters taken under consideration can also be quite
effective.
The rapid identification of active therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 is a major challenge. Analyzing the available
knowledge on their safety profiles, and in some cases, efficacy against other coronaviruses and repurposing existing
antiviral drugs is a potentially crucial short-term strategy to tackle COVID-19.
Under the current scenario, it takes more than 15 years to bring a drug from the investigational stages to market
availability. It is because of the trial and error process or the so-called Edisonian Approach, where one keeps on
analyzing several compounds to find the best possible one. These days with the inclusion of digital medicine, this time
span has been reduced to a great extent and people are able to approach in a rational manner for the drug discovery
process. Here, we have targeted for the repurpssed drugs towards the development of effective treatment of COVID-19
to speed up clinical trial. We have found that ML model created on the basis of the Naive Bayes algorithm is the most
effective one with the accuracy of almost equal to 73%. The drugs predicted by this model is further verified by the
docking process. We speculate that our predicted drugs show immense potential for treatment of the COVID-19.
Considering the ongoing efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 all over the world, we are optimistic that the
outbreak may subside in a few months like SARS and MERS. However, the outbreak has stressed the urgent need for
renewed efforts towards the development of braod-spectrum therapeutic agents to combat coronaviruses which are
repeatedly found to be a realistic threat of this century till now. Our this findinging will provide a base for further
enhanced drug discovery programs.
