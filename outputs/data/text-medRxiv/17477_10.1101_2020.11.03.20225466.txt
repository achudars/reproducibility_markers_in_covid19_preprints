Abstract
Delirium is a serious and common complication among critically ill patients with COVID19. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical course of delirium for
COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit, including post-discharge cognitive
outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted for patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 (n=148) admitted to an intensive care unit at Michigan Medicine between
3/1/2020 and 5/31/2020. Delirium was identified in 107/148 (72%) patients in the study
cohort, with median (interquartile range) duration lasting 10 (4 – 17) days. Sedative
regimens, inflammation, deviation from delirium prevention protocols, and hypoxicischemic injury were likely contributing factors, and the most common disposition for
delirious patients was a skilled care facility (41/148, 38%). Among patients who were
delirious during hospitalization, 4/17 (24%) later tested positive for delirium at home
based on caretaker assessment, 5/22 (23%) demonstrated signs of questionable
cognitive impairment or cognitive impairment consistent with dementia, and 3/25 (12%)
screened positive for depression within two months after discharge. Overall, patients
with COVID-19 commonly experience a prolonged course of delirium in the intensive
care unit, likely with multiple contributing factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological
impairment may persist after discharge.

Introduction:
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the
virus that causes Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), emerged as a public health threat
in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization in
March 2020. Several studies have reported the serious nature of complications
associated with this disease. Major neurological complications, such as
encephalopathy, delirium, strokes, seizures, and ataxia, have all been observed.1-5
Delirium appears to be a common complication, with previous investigations
demonstrating an incidence of approximately 65-80% in the intensive care unit (ICU).1,4
Delirium may occur due to direct coronavirus invasion into central nervous system, 6
and systemic inflammatory responses may further exacerbate neurocognitive
impairment. In the ICU, synergistic factors such as sedation regimen, social isolation,
and deviation from standard care protocols may further increase risk. Delirium is also
associated with prolonged hospitalization, long-term cognitive and functional
impairment, and increased mortality.7-9 As such, there is a critical need to advance
understanding of this syndrome in patients with COVID-19.

While a high incidence of delirium has been previously reported in COVID-19 patients,
fundamental questions persist. The clinical course of delirium, including average
duration and post-discharge cognitive trajectory, remains unknown. Pathophysiologic
drivers of delirium (e.g., polypharmacy, inflammation, cerebrovascular events) are
incompletely understood, and the extent to which standard prevention protocols are
implemented is unclear. Such detailed understanding will contribute to delirium

phenotyping of COVID-19 patients and provide insight into the clinical and
neurocognitive burden associated with COVID-19. In this context, the objective of this
study was to determine granular details associated with delirium in ICU patients with
COVID-19. Specifically, the clinical course of delirium, presence of exacerbating factors,
nature of prevention strategy implementation, and post-discharge cognitive outcomes
were all characterized.

Results
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. The majority of patients were AfricanAmerican and non-Hispanic, and the most common comorbidities were hypertension,
Diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Overall, age, demographics, and comorbidity profiles
were similar between patients with delirium and those who did not experience delirium
during hospitalization.

Delirium and Neuropsychological Outcomes
Delirium incidence was high in the cohort (107/148, 72%), and median (interquartile
range) duration was 10 (4 – 17) days (Table 2). The most common delirium prevention
measure, based on the ABCDEF ICU liberation bundle,10,11 was assessment and
treatment for pain; bringing familiar objects from home and spontaneous awakening
trials were the least common (Table 2). Overall, the total number ICU liberation bundle
activities charted was fewer than expected for the median duration of ICU admission
(see Table 2 legend for description of prevention protocol activity schedule). New
antidepressant use was more common for those with delirium (26/107, 24%) compared
to those without delirium (4/41, 9.8%; p=0.049). Similarly, a psychiatry consult was
obtained for 21/107 (20%) delirious patients compared to 0/41 (0%) in the non-delirium
group (p=0.002). Lastly, no evidence of reversal or improvement was reported for nearly
30% of patients during index hospitalization.

Hospitalization and Post-Discharge Outcomes

In terms of hospitalization (Table 3), median length of hospitalization was 25 (13 – 48)
days, and median length of ICU stay 15 (7 – 31). Length of hospitalization, ICU length of
stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation were all significantly prolonged in patients
experiencing delirium (Table 3). Correspondingly, sedative-hypnotic use was higher in
patients with delirium. Delirious patients demonstrated higher white blood cell counts
and higher levels of c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and d-dimer compared
to non-delirious patients. Less than half of patients were ultimately discharged home,
and the most common disposition for those with delirium was a skilled care facility
(41/107, 38%) after discharge (Table 3).

Neuropsychological outcomes after discharge are reported in Table 4. Among patients
who were still alive and available to complete survey materials, nearly 25% of patients
(4/17) scored positive for delirium based on family assessment (FAM-CAM), and all of
these patients were delirious during hospitalization. Similarly, approximately 23% of
patients (5/22) demonstrated either questionable impairment or impairment consistent
with dementia based on the Short Blessed Test, and these patients were also delirious
during hospitalization. Lastly, 12% of patients (3/25) screened positive for depression
after discharge. The three patients who screened positive were also in the delirium
group.

Neuroradiological Findings
In total, 47 patients underwent neuroimaging during hospitalization. The majority of
imaging results were unremarkable or demonstrated incidental findings unrelated to

COVID-19. However, some notable findings were present. A brain MRI was ordered for
a 59-year-old female with COVID-19 pneumonia and recent ECMO decannulation due
to severe encephalopathy (i.e., no response to commands or noxious stimulus) with
preservation of brainstem reflexes. Imaging revealed abnormal fluid attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity affecting the occipital and temporal lobes
(Figures 1A, 1B), microhemorrhage in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Figures 1B,
1C) and posterior leptomeningeal enhancement Figures 1C, 1D), suggestive of
encephalitis. A 29-year-old female with history of ovarian malignancy presented with
new-onset seizures, which for an MRI was ordered. Results revealed diffuse dural
thickening and enhancement (Figure 2A) one day prior to positive COVID testing. The
differential diagnosis included intracranial hypotension (recent lumbar puncture),
inflammation, infection, and neoplastic processes. No definitive diagnosis was reached,
though this enhancement resolved approximately one month later (Figure 2B). Lastly,
one patient demonstrated diffuse parenchymal abnormalities on MRI suggestive of
bilateral hypoxic-ischemic injury (Figure 3). This patient experienced two separate
arrests (pulseless electrical activity) within the preceding three weeks. A non-contrast
head CT two weeks later demonstrated poor sulcation bilaterally, suggesting global
hypoxic-ischemic injury (Figure 4).

Discussion
In a cohort of ICU patients with COVID-19, delirium was a common complication,
affecting more than 70% of patients. Furthermore, delirium was associated with
prolonged hospitalization, increased length of ICU stay, discharge to skilled care
facilities, and positive screens for neuropsychological impairment up to two months after
discharge. Delirium occurred in the setting of multiple sedative-hypnotic agents, acute
inflammatory responses, deviation from delirium prevention protocols, and
cerebrovascular events, which are all factors that could have further catalyzed delirium
precipitation. While ICU liberation activities were conducted, many of the interventions
were infrequently implemented, particularly those that reduce delirium risk (e.g.,
spontaneous awakening trials). Overall, the burden of cognitive impairment was high in
patients with COVID-19, as was the risk of related complications.

These results align with previous data demonstrating a high incidence of delirium in
critically ill patients with COVID-19.1-4 Cognitive dysfunction may occur as a result of
direct coronavirus invasion of the central nervous system6 or other indirect mechanisms,
such as polypharmacy, systemic inflammatory responses, or cerebrovascular events.
Indeed, benzodiazepine sedation was common in this patient cohort, with nearly 60% of
patients receiving midazolam sedation at one point during ICU admission. Lorazepam
was a common sedation agent as well, and benzodiazepine use is associated with
delirium in critically ill patients.12-14 Inflammation may have also contributed to delirium
risk. Inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein, ferritin, interleukin-6, lactate
dehydrogenase) were considerably elevated in this patient cohort. In fact, serum levels

observed in this study aligned with – or exceeded – previously reported values in
patients with severe COVID-19,2,5 and there was MRI evidence of neuroinflammation for
at least two patients in this series. Specific inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive
protein, lactate dehydrogenase) were elevated in delirium patients and may reflect a
specific in neuroinflammatory process. Indeed, c-reactive protein increases blood-brain
barrier permeability in basic science models,15 and lactate dehydrogenase has been
associated with neurocognitive disorders.16,17 However, these were unadjusted,
bivariable analyses, and further covariate adjustment may have revealed a reduced – or
absent – association.5 Lastly, cerebral ischemia may also contribute to delirium risk in
patients with COVID-19. Severe hypoxic-ischemic injury occurred in a patient who
experienced multiple cardiopulmonary arrests during the course of illness. Stroke has
previously been reported in patients with COVID-19,18 as thromboembolic phenomena
and cerebral malperfusion may both occur during the clinical course of COVID-19. As
such, multiple processes likely contribute to delirium in patients with COVID-19.
Targeted case-control studies can address some of these potential risk factors, such
sedative-hypnotic regimens and inflammatory profiles.

Delirium prevention and management are inherently challenging for COVID-19 patients
in the ICU. While delirium prevention bundles have been consistently demonstrated to
reduce risk,19,20 unique challenges posed by COVID-19 hinder the implementation of
standard prevention practices. Spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, for
example, were often not possible due to illness severity and associated ventilator
requirements. Indeed, the median number of total spontaneous awakening trials charted

was two across the entire cohort. Clinicians may have also been limited in terms of
sedation regimen. Agitation was commonly observed, and nearly one-third of patients
required antipsychotics. Agitation and hyperactive delirium likely prompted additional
sedation and prolonged use of physical restraints. Early mobility was limited given
illness severity, and family engagement was often not possible due to visitor policy
restrictions. In-person interactions with clinicians were also limited given the intent of
reducing virus transmission. As such, the culmination of disease severity, limited faceto-face time spent with patients, and visitor restriction policies likely hindered ICU
liberation bundle implementation. Indeed, given that the median length of ICU stay was
15 days across the cohort, most interventions were charted less than once daily (Table
2). Limited implementation of delirium prevention bundles could have increased risk for
delirium incidence, duration, and severity. Interestingly, prevention bundle activities
were charted more commonly in delirious patients. This may have reflected clinician
awareness of delirium and attempts to reduce risk. Novel strategies for implementing
delirium prevention bundles in this patient population may help to further mitigate risk
and should be tested in prospective trials.

Neuropsychological impairment after discharge was also present for some patients
based on subjective reporting, caretaker assessment, and objective testing for
depression and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, all patients that screened positive
for possible impairment also experienced delirium in the hospital. These estimates may
have been even higher, given that approximately 70% patients that were called for postdischarge cognitive assessment were still admitted to skilled care facilities, refused

participation, or were unable to be reached. Whether post-discharge cognitive
impairment was related specifically to COVID-19 or critical illness more broadly is
unclear. Indeed, cognitive impairment is common at discharge for patients who
experienced delirium while in the ICU, and delirium is present for nearly 20% of patients
newly admitted to acute care facilities.7,21 Moreover, cognitive impairment can be
present for months-to-years after acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis,22-24
and symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder are commonly reported
among ICU survivors.25 Neuropsychological impairment after discharge may, in part,
reflect critical illness, rather than pathophysiologic insults specific to COVID-19.
Nonetheless, ICU patients with COVID-19 experience considerable neuropsychological
burden, and related complications, both during and after hospitalization.

The strengths of this study include granular data with respect to delirium, potential risk
factors, nature and frequency of prevention strategies, related complications, and postdischarge outcomes. Data were representative of an academic tertiary care center with
nearly 150 patients. A validated chart review method was used to identify delirium,26
and the study measures used to characterize cognitive function, such as the FAM-CAM,
Short Blessed Test, and PROMIS assessments, are validated measures that increase
confidence in the results. In terms of limitations, this is a this was a single center
analysis, and the results are restricted to the institution studied. The study was not
conducted with a matched control cohort, as the nature of this study was descriptive.
Lastly, data were limited for post-discharge cognitive outcomes, as more than half of
patients called were unavailable to complete assessments.

In summary, delirium is common complication of COVID-19 with multiple contributing
factors. Furthermore, neuropsychological impairment may persist in some patients after
discharge. Further research should aim to identify independent risk factors in this
population and novel, effective prevention strategies.

Methods:
Study design and overview
This was a single-center, institutional case series from Michigan Medicine. Detailed
chart review data were collected from critically ill patients with COVID-19 (3/1/2020 –
5/31/2020), and post-discharge telephone surveys were conducted to determine if
cognitive impairment persisted after discharge. All study operations were conducted at
Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor MI USA, and approval was obtained from the University
of Michigan Medical School Institutional Review Board (HUM00182646).

Eligibility criteria
All patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis admitted to a Michigan Medicine ICU between
03/01/2020 – 05/31/2020 were eligible for study inclusion. ICU patients admitted during
this time, without a diagnosis of COVID-19, were not eligible for study inclusion.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was delirium presence (yes/no, %) at any point during admission.
Delirium was evaluated via chart review method (described below). Several secondary
outcomes were also collected in relation to delirium and overall clinical trajectory. These
outcomes included the following: duration of delirium (days), antipsychotic
administration, length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, number of days requiring
ventilator support, inflammatory laboratory values (white blood cell count, c-reactive
protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, and interleukin-6), new psychiatry
consults, new antidepressant use, and final disposition (e.g., home, long-term care

facility, death). Delirium prevention strategies, based on the ABCDEF ICU liberation
bundle,10,11 were also recorded. These included the following: assess and treat for pain,
discontinue physical restraints, structured mobility exercises, removal of temporary
medical lines or devices, place familiar objects from home at the bedside, family
education and reassurance, promote use of visual and hearing aids, sleep promotion
protocols (e.g., lights off at night, melatonin tablets), and spontaneous awakening trials.
The total number of times a prevention strategy was charted was recorded for each
patient. The median of these total values was then reported for each prevention
strategy. Neuroimaging data were also collected and reviewed.

Lastly, a telephone survey was conducted between 30-60 days post-discharge to
determine whether subjective or objective signs of cognitive impairment were present.
During telephone interviews, the following tests were conducted: the Patient-Reported
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)27 Cognitive Function Abilities
4a, Short Blessed Test (score 0-4 = normal cognition, score 5-9 = questionable
impairment, score ≥10 = impairment consistent with dementia),28 Family Confusion
Assessment Method for delirium,29 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (scores ≥10
were considered positive screens for depression).30,31

Data collection
Screening for eligible patients was first performed for via DataDirect, a self-serve
software tool from the University of Michigan Office of Research that enables research

teams to retrospectively search for patient cohorts. Charts that screened positive were
then manually reviewed by study team members to confirm study eligibility.

Charts were then reviewed in further detail for outcome abstraction. Delirium was
assessed via a validated chart review method.26 Briefly, any instance of an acute
confusional state was recorded in the instrument. The source of information was
recorded, along with the date and time. The total number of days with acute confusion
was also included in the instrument, along with any evidence of reversibility or
improvement of the confusion state. Other clinical outcomes, along with laboratory
values, were collected directly from the charts. Neuroimaging studies were manually
reviewed by a board certified radiologist with a Certificate of Added Qualification in
neuroradiology (R.L.).

Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 27 (Armonk, NY USA).
Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to assess the distribution of dependent
measures for determining the appropriate analytical strategy. The Shapiro-Wilk test was
used to assess the distribution of continuous outcomes, and Independent t-tests or
Mann-Whitney U tests were used as appropriate. Mean (standard deviation) or median
(interquartile range) was reported for parametric and non-parametric data, respectively.
For binary outcomes and proportions, The Chi-Square Test or Fisher’s Exact Test were
used, as appropriate. The threshold for significance was set to p<0.05 across all tests.
For post-discharge cognitive outcomes, descriptive statistics were reported.

Figure 1. Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) (a, b) images at the level of the basal ganglia
show abnormal FLAIR hyperintense signal (arrows) affecting the bilateral occipital, temporal lobes. This
appears almost sulcal suggesting a higher protein component within the cerebrospinal fluid. Note the
elevated FLAIR signal in the splenium of the corpus callosum (arrow) suggesting parenchymal insult.
Axial susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) (c) at the level of the splenium of the corpus callosum shows
small areas of susceptibility (arrow) in the splenium, likely related to microhemorrhage. Axial T1 (d) postcontrast with fat suppression at the level of the basal ganglia shows subtle, though true, enhancement
(arrows) in the posterior sulci, arachnoid pial (leptomeningeal) pattern suggesting a degree of
encephalitis.

Figure 2. Axial T1 post-contrast with fat suppression images at the level of the mid lateral ventricles
demonstrate smooth dural enhancement (a) (arrows) along the bilateral cerebral convexities. This feature
resolves one month later (b) (arrows). The overall pattern of dura-arachnoid/pachymeningeal
enhancement is non-specific, can be seen with intracranial hypotension, in the procedural setting (e.g.,
lumbar puncture), and other scenarios (e.g., infection, inflammation).

Figure 3. After initial non-contrast head CT (which was unremarkable), the patient had diffuse
parenchymal abnormalities on MRI examination. Axial diffusion-weighted imaging (a) shows hyperintense
signal (arrows) at the bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, and posterior cortices, regions are hypointense
(arrows) on corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient map (b). These same locations are hyperintense
on T2 (c) and FLAIR (d), especially at the basal ganglia and thalami.

Figure 4. Non-contrast head CT performed approximately two weeks after cardiopulmonary arrest shows
poor sulcation (arrows) bilaterally, suggesting global insult, most likely hypoxic-ischemic in etiology.

Delirium prevention measures are based on the standard ICU liberation bundle protocols (see text for
details). Per institutional protocol, clinicians conduct pain assessments every two hours (and more
frequently as needed for procedures), range of motion exercises are scheduled three times daily,
spontaneous awakening/breathing trials occur daily (if medically appropriate), and family updates are
scheduled once daily. Given this schedule, these prevention measures were charted less frequently than
expected based on a median ICU course of 15 (7 – 31) days. IQR interquartile range.
