Abstract
We estimated risk of death in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated COVID-19 cases. Cases
vaccinated with 1 dose of BNT162b2 had 44% reduced risk of death, 55% with 1 dose of ChAdOx1,
and 69% with 2 doses of BNT162b2. This is on top of the protection provided against becoming a
case.

Introduction
Real world effectiveness data has begun to emerge for COVID-19 vaccines, showing high levels of
protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, supporting the findings of the
phase III clinical trials.(1-6) Nevertheless, evidence on effectiveness against mortality, the most
severe outcome, is currently limited and has not yet been reported for most vaccines.(2)
The UK was the first country to implement a COVID-19 vaccination programme, starting with the
Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in December and followed soon afterwards with the
Oxford-Astrazeneca ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector vaccine. Vaccination was offered to older adults,
care home residents and health and social care workers first, delivery was subsequently rolled out to
increasingly younger age cohorts and to clinical risk groups. A policy decision was made early on in
the programme to use an extended dosing interval of 12 weeks, in order to maximise the number of
vulnerable people offered the first dose.
Early data suggested that a single dose of BNT162b2 was 80-85% effective at preventing mortality in
individuals aged over 80 years.(2) However, effectiveness of ChAdOx1 against mortality has not yet
been reported.

Methods
This study estimates the risk of death among confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to their
vaccination status.
In England a community COVID-19 testing programme is available to individuals reporting symptoms
(high temperature, new continuous cough, loss or change in sense of smell or taste), care home
residents and staff, and individuals taking part in local or national mass asymptomatic testing. We
linked all new symptomatic PCR positive cases to mortality data from NHS records.(7) Testing and
deaths data between 8th December (when the vaccination programme started) and 17th April were
initially extracted. This was subsequently restricted to deaths to April 6th as lags in deaths
registrations could affect the most recent days.
Survival analysis was conducted to estimate the hazard ratios for death within 28 days of a positive
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test by vaccination status: unvaccinated, vaccinated with one dose (where the first
dose was received at least 21 days before the test date), vaccinated with 2 doses (where the second
dose was received at least 7 days before). We also estimated effects among those who received first
doses 0-20 days prior to testing positive (earlier than an effect would be anticipated) as a control
analysis. Adjustments were made for sex, clinical risk factors for severe disease (including
immunosuppressive disease or therapy, severe respiratory disease, rare diseases and inborn errors
of metabolism that significantly increase the risk of infections, pregnancy with significant congenital
heart disease),(8) age in 5 year bands, and whether they had been identified as a care home
resident. Estimates were stratified by age group (70-79 and 80+ years) and whether they were a care
home resident.

Results
48,096 cases aged 70 years and above were included in the analysis, of which 79.1% were
unvaccinated; 12.7% had been vaccinated with BNT162b2 (3,910 received their first dose within 20
days of their test date, 2,007 received their first dose >=21 days before their test date and 191
received their 2nd dose >=7 days before their test date); and 8.2% had been vaccinated with
ChAdOx1 (2,686 received their first dose within 20 days of their test date, 1,258 received their first
dose >=21 days before their test date and 6 received their 2nd dose >=7 days before their test date).
Kaplan Meier curves showing the proportion who died by days after the positive test for the first
dose and unvaccinated are shown in figure 1. Among 80+ year olds with at least 28 days of follow-up
data 16.1% (1462/9105) of unvaccinated cases died, 9.2% (99/1,072) of cases vaccinated with 1 dose
of BNT162b2 died, 11.3% (33/293) of cases vaccinated with 1 dose of ChAdOx1, and 4.7% (6/128) of
cases vaccinated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 died. Among 70-79 year olds with at least 28 days of
follow-up data 4.0% (1,147/28,875) of unvaccinated cases died, 2.7% (15/549) of cases vaccinated
with 1 dose of BNT162b2 died, 2.1% (10/484) of cases vaccinated with 1 dose of ChAdOx1, and 0%
(0/7) of cases vaccinated with 2 doses of BNT162b2 died. There were no individuals with 28 days of
follow-up after 2 doses of ChAdOx1.

In the fully adjusted model, hazard ratios compared to unvaccinated cases were 0.56 (95%CI 0.470.68) for 1 dose of BNT162b2, 0.45 (95%CI 0.34-0.59) for 1 dose of ChAdOx1 and 0.31 (95%CI 0.140.69) for 2 doses of BNT162b2. This indicates an additional 44% protection against death after the
first dose of BNT162b2, 55% after the first dose of ChAdOx1, and 69% after the second dose of
BNT162b2, on top of the protection against become a case. There was little difference by age group;
the hazard ratios after the first BNT162b2 dose were 0.49 (95% CI 0.31-0.78) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.460.69) for age 70-79 and 80+, respectively, whilst for ChAdOx1 they were 0.46 (95%CI 0.28-0.75) and
0.45 (95% CI 0.32-0.63) respectively. Note that in age 80+ care home adjustment was important and
led to a lower hazard ratio for ChAdOx1 despite the crude Kaplan-Meier showing lower mortality for
BNT162b2.
In the control analysis among those vaccinated with first doses 0-20 days prior to testing positive,
the hazard ratio with BNT162b2 was 0.81 (95% 0.73-0.91) and with ChAdOx1 0.99 (95%CI 0.87-1.12).
There were notable differences by care home resident status. Among care home residents, hazard
ratios were 0.87 (95%CI 0.60-1.25) for 1 dose of BNT162b2 and 0.37 (95%CI 0.23-0.60) for 1 dose of
ChAdOx1 (numbers were too small for estimating 2 dose effects with either vaccine). Among noncare home residents, hazard ratios compared to unvaccinated cases were 0.48 (95%CI 0.38-0.59) for
1 dose of BNT162b2 and 0.52 (95%CI 0.37-0.73) for 1 dose of ChAdOx1.

Discussion
We found that confirmed cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated with either a single dose of
BNT162b2 or a single dose of ChAdOx1 had significantly reduced risk of dying compared to
unvaccinated cases. The point estimates showed greater protection with ChAdOx1, though
confidence intervals overlapped suggesting little difference between the two vaccines. Combined
with recent estimates of protection against symptomatic disease in the same age group, these
findings suggest that a single dose of either vaccine is approximately 80% effective at preventing
mortality, and two doses of BNT162b2 is approximately 97% effective at preventing mortality in
older adults.(2, 9)
The phase three clinical trials have been unable to report on efficacy against mortality due to smaller
numbers. Our findings with BNT162b2 were similar to real world findings previously reported in the
UK and Israel, both in the context of B.1.1.7 variant as the dominant strain.(2, 10) Our study is the

first to estimate for the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 against mortality and suggests that a single dose
offers similar levels of protection to BNT162b2.
We found that although both vaccines provided additional protection against mortality overall,
among care home residents who received a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the effect was small
and non-significant suggesting that there was no clear evidence additional protection (beyond the
protection against becoming a case). Though this could be due to residual confounding and lacking
statistical power in this group.
Our study is observational and as such we are unable to exclude unmeasured or residual
confounding. For example, healthy vaccinee effects, whereby healthier individuals are more likely to
present for vaccination and also more likely to survive, could be an issue. We see some evidence of a
possible healthy vaccinee effect with the BNT162b2 because we see a small effect in days 0-20 after
the first dose, before a vaccine effect might be anticipated, whereas we don’t see this effect with
ChAdOx1. However, we have previously found that vaccine effects occur more rapidly with
BNT162b2, so this could represent early vaccine effects.(2) A further limitation is that some of the
deaths within 28 days of a positive test may be unrelated to COVID and therefore not preventable by
vaccination. All of the individuals included in this analysis had reported symptoms of COVID-19,
therefore the proportion of deaths unrelated to COVID is likely to be small, however, this could
cause us to underestimate the effects on mortality.
In conclusion, we find strong evidence that both vaccines offer high levels of protection against
mortality after a single dose which supports prioritising the first dose in at risk groups in the context
of high disease incidence and vaccine supply or delivery constraints. Nevertheless, a second dose of
BNT162b2 offers yet further protection against mortality, highlighting the importance of completing
the course. We are not yet able to estimate two dose effects with ChAdOx1 due to the later rollout
of this vaccine.
