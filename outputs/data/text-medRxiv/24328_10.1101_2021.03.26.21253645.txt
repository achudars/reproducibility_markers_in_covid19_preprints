Running Title: “Low T-cell response in recurrent COVID19”.

Key points: Immune parameters leading to COVID-19 recurrence/reinfection are
incompletely understood. A COVID-19 recurrence case in a monozygotic twin pair is
described with an intact antibody and innate type I/III Interferon response and drastically
reduced number of recognized SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes.

ABSTRACT
Background. Clinical recurrence of COVID-19 in convalescent patients has been reported,
which immune mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Presence of neutralizing
antibodies suggests other types of immune response are involved. Methods. We assessed the
innate type I/III IFN response, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 with IFNγ ELISPOT,
binding and neutralizing antibody assays, in two monozygotic twin pairs with one COVID-19
recurrence case. Results. In pair 1, four months after a first mild episode of infection for both
siblings, one displayed severe clinical recurrence of COVID-19. Twin pair 2 of siblings
underwent non-recurring asymptomatic infection. All fours individuals presented similar
overall responses, except for remarkably difference found in specific cellular responses.
Recurring sibling presented a reduced number of recognized T cell epitopes as compared to
the other three including her non-recurring sibling. Conclusions. Our results suggest that an
effective SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune response is key for complete viral control and
avoidance of clinical recurrence of COVID-19. Besides, adaptive immunity can be distinct in
MZ twins. Given the rising concern about SARS-CoV-2 variants that evade neutralizing
antibodies elicited by vaccination or infection, our study stresses the importance of T cell
responses in protection against recurrence/reinfection.

BACKGROUND
Coronavirus SARS-Cov2, the causative agent of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory
syndrome, has caused the most critical public health crisis in the last 100 years (1). Clinical
recurrence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in persons with previous COVID-19 infection has
been increasingly reported. This has been attributed to a viral relapse in a host that failed to
completely eradicate the virus or to reinfection with a different viral genome (2, 3). The
involvement of innate/Type I/III interferon (IFN) response as well as the specific antibody
and T cell responses is well established in the protection against SARS-CoV-2 (4). However,
the immune mechanisms underlying reinfection/virus relapse are still mostly unexplored.
Investigation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity in clinical recurrence/reinfection cases have
been only directed to the humoral response. COVID-19 reinfection can occur both in the
presence or absence of binding (5) or neutralizing antibodies (3, 6-9). This suggests that
additional immune responses apart from neutralizing antibodies may be involved in control of
reinfection and recurrence. Investigation of COVID-19 reinfection/recurrence can thus
provide key information regarding immune protection mechanisms and guide vaccine studies
(5).
We present a case of monozygotic twins who acquired mild COVID-19 early in 2020
and only one of them–who is a health care worker- presented recurrence four months after
initial infection. In order to investigate the underlying immune mechanisms, we performed a
comprehensive assessment of innate and adaptive immunity. In addition to binding and
neutralizing antibody assays, we assessed the innate type I/III IFN response kinetics after
TLR3 stimulation and the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 synthetic peptides with the IFN-

gamma ELISPOT assay. A second pair of monozygotic twins with concordant asymptomatic
infection after exposure to COVID-19 symptomatic parents was also studied as a control.

METHODS
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research of the Institute of
Biosciences at the University of São Paulo (CAAE 34786620.2.0000.5464) and all
participants (or their parents) provided a written consent.

Human Samples and processing
Participants were selected based on their clinical history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Clinical data were collected in an interview and are detailed in the Supplementary Material.
Participants were followed up for 6-10 months after COVID clinical symptoms and blood
samples were collected on July 2020 and January 2021 for Twin pair 1 and 2, respectively.
PBMCs were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation using Ficoll–Paque and stored in
liquid nitrogen until use. Sera were processed and kept frozen at -80oC until use.

TLR3 stimulus and type I/III IFN innate immune response
Cryopreserved cells were thawn and stimulated with 1µg/ml of Poly I:C HMW
(Invivogen) for 1, 4 and 8h. Negative controls were incubated with R10 medium alone. Total
RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) and cDNA was prepared
using the Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermofisher, USA), according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Real‐time PCR was performed using the Power SYBR Green
Master Mix (Thermofisher, USA) on a QuantStudio 12K flex (Applied Biosystems, USA).

The cycling program was used as follows: 95°C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 and
60 °C for 1 min. Primers used are listed in the Supplementary Table 1.

Antibody assays
SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM were initially detected by the clinical laboratory using the
chemoluminescence immunoassay MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgM/IgG assay (Shenzhen New
Industries Biomedical Engineering Co., Ltd, China). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
ELISA was performed using 96-well high-binding half-area polystyrene plates coated
overnight at 4oC with 4 μg/mL of Spike protein, 2 μg/mL Nucleocapsid protein (NP) (Kindly
provided by Dr Ricardo Gazzinelli, UFMG) or 0.8μg/mL of the RBD domain from human
endemic coronaviruses HKU-1, OC43, NL63, and 229E, all expressed in HEK293T cells.
Plasmids encoding endemic coronavirus RBD domains described in (10). Patients’ serum
samples were incubated at 56°C for 30 min, diluted 1:100 and run in triplicates. In short, 50
µL of diluted sera were incubated at 37°C for 45 min. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human
IgG (BD Pharmingen,USA), anti-human IgA (KPL, USA) or anti-human IgM (Sigma, USA)
Secondary antibody conjugates were diluted 1:10,000, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
Values were determined as optical density (OD) minus blank and cutoff was determined as
blank+ 3x standard deviation.

Pseudovirus Neutralizing Antibody assays
The pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed exactly as described previously (11).
HT1080 expressing ACE2 cells (HT1080/ACE2) and plasmids HIV-1NLΔEnv-NanoLuc and
pSARS-CoV-2-SΔ19 were kindly provided by Dr. Paul D. Bieniasz (The Rockefeller
University). Briefly, 104 HT1080/ACE2 were plated in 96-well plates and maintained at
37°C, 5% CO2 for 24hs. The pseudovirus was incubated in duplicate with serial dilutions of

the samples for 1h at 37°C. After 48 hours of incubation at 5% CO2 at 37°C, wells were
washed, and cells were lysed with Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase substrate (Promega)
was added to each well, and the plate read at a GlowMax luminometer (Promega). 50%
inhibitory dilution (IC50) was calculated using Prism software (v7.0, GraphPad) after
subtraction of the background RLUs in the control wells (cells only).

Interferon gamma (IFNγ) ELISPOT assay
SARS-CoV2 specific T cell responses were assessed using human ex vivo IFNγ
ELISPOT against a set of 20 CD4+ and 26 CD8+ T cell epitopes from 13 distinct SARSCoV-2 proteins with high HLA allelic population coverage. We identified and synthesized
the CD4+ T cell epitopes by scanning the whole proteome in SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome (RefSeq: NC_045512.2) using the promiscuous HLA-DR binding peptide approach
(12). The chosen CD8+ T cell epitopes were known to bind stably (www.immunitrack.com)
or to be directly recognized (13) in the context of the 10 most frequent HLA class I alleles.
The world population coverage of HLAs predicted to bind to the 20 CD4+ T cell epitopes
and 26 CD8+ T cell epitopes was 99.6%, and 94%, respectively, according to the IEDB
epitope database (14). Peptide sequences are listed in

Supplementary Table 2.

Cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and rested overnight in R10 medium (RPMI
supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% v/v vitamin solution, 1
mM sodium pyruvate, 1% v/v non-essential amino acids, 50 U/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin
and 5x105 M of 2-mercaptoethanol; Thermofisher, USA) containing 30 U/ml of recombinant
human IL-2 (ProleukinTM, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, Germany). Cells were seeded at
105 cells/well in MultiScreen MAIPS Filter Plates (Merck) using coating and secondary antiIFNγ antibodies (BD Biosciences). Incubation was performed for 18 hours with synthetic
peptides (5 ug/mL; Genscript), medium alone or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) plus

ionomycin (50 ng/mL and 1 ug/mL, respectively) and developed with AEC substrate. Spots
were counted using an AID ELISpot Reader System (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH). The
number of IFNγ producing cells/106 PBMC for each peptide was calculated after subtracting
the values of control wells (R10 medium alone) for each subject. The cutoff value (105 IFNγ
producing cells/106 PBMC) was established as the average + 3 standard deviations of test
results of the 46 peptides on cryopreserved PBMC from 19 pre-pandemic Brazilian healthy
control subjects (data not shown).

HLA typing
Whole-exome sequencing was performed on peripheral blood DNA in Illumina NovaSeq
platform at HUG-CELL facilities. Sequencing data was analyzed following bwa-mem and
GATK Best Practices workflow, quality control and annotation was performed as previously
described (15). HLA genes were realigned and called using HLA-mapper, which reduces
mapping and calling errors (16).

RESULTS
Immunological assays in monozygotic twin pair 1 discordant for severe clinical
recurrence of COVID-19
Demographical data and HLA, A, B, C and DR alleles of each of the twin pairs are
compiled in Table 1. Clinical symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory results and dates of
specific immunological tests for both twin pairs are summarized in timelines (Figure 1). The
volunteers of the present study were identified as V01, V02 (siblings of twin pair 1), V03 and
V04 (siblings of twin pair 2). For twin pair 1, initial COVID-19 symptoms were mild in both
siblings (V01 in February and V02 in April). Both tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
in mid-May 2020. Four months after her first COVID-19-episode, V01 displayed a severe

COVID-19 recurrence, with pulmonary alterations and sPO2<90% on room air, warranting
intensive care unit admission for 24h. Her IgG titer on admission was 2-fold higher than in
the first serology, in mid-May. Innate and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and cellular
immune responses were further investigated in samples collected on August 2020 and January
2021 (Figure 1).
Anti-Spike and anti-NP IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies were measured with ELISA
(Figure 2A). Both twins displayed IgG against the Spike protein, with higher levels for V01
than V02 while the twin pair 2 presented anti-Spike and anti-NP IgG. Likewise, neutralizing
antibodies (nAb) titers were around 1:500 for V01 and just below negative control for V02.
For twin pair 2, nAb levels were similar to those of V01 (Figure 2B). IgG antibodies against
the RBD of the four main circulating endemic coronaviruses, NL63, 229E, HKU1, OC43
were similar for all 4 cases, displaying antibodies for 3 out of 4 tested coronaviruses. The
antibody profiles to human endemic coronaviruses were virtually identical in both twins V01
and V02 (Figure 2C).
To investigate the kinetics of innate type I/III IFN responses, we stimulated PBMC with
TLR stimulus (double-stranded RNA Poly I:C). We observed early (1h) and high (FC>10)
mRNA expression of at least one of the four IFNs tested in all four cases. In twin siblings
from pair 1, V01 expressed high IFNB1, and V02 expressed high IFNA2 and IFNL3 (Figure
3A). In twin pair 2, V03 expressed high IFNA2 and INFL2, while V04 expressed high IFNB1
(Figure 3B). Kinetics of Type I/type III IFNs was variable in later time points. Expression of
ISGs was nearly identical within each twin pair, presenting an identical pattern of IFIT3,
IFITM1 and IRF7 in twin pair 1 while a lower, concordant response was observed for pair 2
(Figures 3E-H).
To assess the T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes, we performed IFNγ
ELISPOT assays on PBMC samples (see timelines in Figure 1). The recurrent case V01

recognized only 3 out of 20 CD4+ T cell epitopes (15%) while her sibling recognized 17
CD4+ T cell epitopes (85%; P<0.0001, Fisher Exact Test) (Figure 4A). Furthermore, V01
recognized only 4 CD8+ T cell epitopes (15%), while her sibling recognized 19 out of the 26
CD8+ T cell epitopes (73%; P<0.0001, Fisher Exact Test) (Figure 4B). Both twin siblings
V03 and V04 recognized >70% of CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes (20 and 14 out of 20 CD4+ T
cell epitopes and 26 and 21 out of 26 CD8+ T cell epitopes, respectively) (Figures 4A and
4B). These results indicate that the twin with COVID-19 recurrence showed a drastically
reduced breadth (number of recognized epitopes) of both CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2 T
cell epitopes as compared with her non-recurrent sibling and also the second MZ twin pair.

DISCUSSION
Here we describe a comprehensive assessment of innate and adaptive immune response
against SARS-CoV-2 in two pairs of monozygotic twins, including a case of severe COVID19 recurrence in one of two twin, a health care worker. We found that the only immune
parameter that was substantially lower in the COVID-19 recurrence case as compared to her
twin sibling and a second pair of MZ twins was the breadth (number of recognized epitopes)
of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of innate
and T cell immune responses in the context of COVID-19 recurrence and reinfection. Of note,
there were also fluctuations in some other immune parameters within each MZ twin pair.
Innate Type I/III IFN responses are the first line of cellular defense against RNA viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 induces lower Type I/III IFN responses as compared to other respiratory
viruses due to viral-encoded proteins that dampen such responses (4). An immune response
characterized by a weak, delayed production of Type I/III interferons contributes to severe
forms of the disease (17). The finding that all four tested patients including the COVID-19

recurrence case presented an early, strong type I/III IFN response indicates that recurrence
was not associated with failure in the innate IFN response.
Protection against reinfection by viruses is mainly mediated by adaptative immune
responses. Memory responses to secondary exposure to pathogen limit or prevent reinfection
(5). Immunological investigation of COVID-19 recurrence and reinfection has been so far
limited to antibody reactivity profiles. In a recent review of 16 reinfection cases ocurring 19142 days after the first infection episode, 10 reported anti-SARS-CoV-2IgG testing, 6 of
which displayed positive serology at the time of second infection; reinfections occurred in
patients with all degrees of severity in the primary infection, but 75% of the reinfections were
asymptomatic or mild (5). Neutralizing antibodies (nAb) were detected at the time of
reinfection in three case reports (3, 6, 7), while only one case reported reinfection in the
absence of detectable nAb (8) suggesting that responses beyond neutralizing antibodies are
important to control reinfection. In our study, reinfected case V01 presented nAb 6 weeks
after COVID-19 recurrence. Although we cannot ensure that neutralizing antibodies were
present earlier when recurrence occurred, increased levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were
detectable at hospital admission indicating that COVID-19 recurrence boosted IgG levels,
which is in line with literature reports (5).
Our finding that the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses of the COVID-19 recurrence case
had a drastically reduced breadth 4 months after hospital discharge is indicative of a low
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response. This is in contrast with the finding that hospitalized
patients display a larger breadth of CD4+ T cell responses than outpatients (18). Given the
importance of T cell responses associated with COVID-19 infection (19), a dampened CD4+
T cell response can have important consequences for many aspects of anti-SARS-COV-2
immunity. Asymptomatic and mild cases of CoVID-19 are correlated with specific CD4+ and
CD8+ T cell responses, but not with IgG or neutralizing antibody, suggesting that T cells are

the primary effectors controlling a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (4, 20, 21). The dominant
cytokine produced by virus-specific CD4+ T cells is IFNγ with a Th1 profile, associated with
antiviral activity. CD4+ T cells protect mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection (22), and Th1
CD4+ T cells are important to provide help for the cytotoxic CD8+ T responses crucial for
clearance of viral infections. CD4+ T follicular helper cells contribute for B cell responses,
and IL-22-producing T cells observed in COVID-19 are key for maintenance of mucosal
repair, particularly gut and lung epithelial cells (4).
It is unlikely that the reduced T cell responses observed in V01 are due the absence of
HLA presentation to T cells, since her MZ twin V02 carrying the same HLA alleles displayed
a broad recognition profile. Also, it is not likely that the contrasting T cell responses observed
between the two siblings is a result of previous exposure to cross-reacting viruses (23), since
their IgG profile against human endemic coronaviruses’ RBD was nearly identical.
Our study has limitations. We report observations for only one case of COVID-19
recurrence and cannot ensure that our findings are common in COVID-19 recurrence. We
cannot conclude whether this recurrence event is a bona fide reinfection or a viral relapse in a
chronic carrier since we did not genotype the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most reinfection episodes
were reported to be asymptomatic or mild (5). However, the 4-month interval between the
two events in an exposed health care worker with a more severe clinical presentation is more
suggestive of reinfection due to re-exposure than of a viral relapse.
In short, our results suggest that the failure in inducing a broad T cell response might
have enhanced susceptibility to COVID-19 recurrence in the reported case. Our data may
support a prime role for T cells in protection against reinfection. Given the increased concern
that SARS-CoV-2 variants escaping antibody neutralization could give rise to a massive raise
in reinfection (24, 25), our case stresses the importance of T cell immune responses in
protection against reinfection. This is in line with the reported lack of deleterious effect of

virus variants in the cellular immune response (26). Further investigation in a larger cohort
can shed light on whether T cell dysfunction is a common mechanism for recurrence of
COVID-19.
