ABSTRACT
Introduction: Despite limitations on the use of cycle threshold (CT) values for individual
patient care, population distributions of CT values may be useful indicators of local outbreaks.
Methods: Specimens from the greater El Paso area were processed in the Dascena COVID-19
Laboratory. Daily median CT value, daily transmission rate R(t), daily count of COVID-19
hospitalizations, daily change in percent positivity, and rolling averages of these features were
plotted over time. Two-way scatterplots and linear regression evaluated possible associations
between daily median CT and outbreak measures. Cross-correlation plots determined whether a
time delay existed between changes in the daily median CT value and measure of community
disease dynamics.
Results: Daily median CT was negatively correlated with the daily R(t), the daily COVID-19
hospitalization count (with a time delay), and the daily change in percent positivity among
testing samples. Despite visual trends suggesting time delays in the plots for median CT and
outbreak measures, a statistically significant delay was only detected between changes in median
CT and COVID-19 hospitalization count.
Conclusions: This study adds to the literature by analyzing samples collected from an entire
geographical area, and contextualizing the results with other research investigating population
CT values.

INTRODUCTION
As of February 16, 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than 109 million
people around the world, and has been implicated in 2.41 million deaths (1). In the United States
(US) alone, more than 486,500 deaths have been attributed to coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) (1). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests have become
the predominant method for COVID-19 surveillance and diagnostic testing due to their high
sensitivity, high specificity and rapid turn-around time compared to viral culture (2,3). RT-PCR
tests detect viral genetic material in biological samples (4). The cycle threshold (CT) value
represents the number of PCR cycles required in order to detect a positive signal (5). The CT
value is inversely related to the viral load, such that a 3.3 increase in CT value indicates an
approximately 10-fold decrease in the amount of viral genetic material present in a sample (5).
COVID-19 RT-PCR tests are generally considered positive only if they generate a result with a
CT value lower than the recommended cut-off; in the US, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has approved emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for tests for which CT values < 37
can be considered positive (6).
CT values are lowest, indicating a larger amount of viral genetic material, early in the
disease course. Indeed, numerous studies have reported that CT values tend to be highest prior to
or in the earliest days following the onset of symptoms, and decline as disease progresses (7–11).
Lower CT values have been directly linked with higher infectivity, as shown by the ability to
cultivate live SARS-CoV-2 from samples (7,11–14) and the number of individuals infected by an
index case (15). In one study, SARS-CoV-2 could be cultivated from over 70% of samples with
a CT value < 25, but from less than 3% of samples with CT value ≥ 35 (16). CT values have also
been directly correlated with disease severity and mortality, such that the CT values tend to be
lower in patients with more severe disease presentations (13,17–19) and in hospitalized patients
who ultimately die from COVID-19 (13,20).
However, there are significant limitations to the use of CT values for prognostication and
treatment planning at the level of the individual patient. Critics have noted that there may be
significant variability in CT values based on the quantity of biological material collected on a
testing swab, as well differences in RT-PCR reagents, equipment and standards between
laboratories (21). CT values may also vary based on the gene target selected for RT-PCR, or
even on the assay used to detect the same gene target (22). In addition, RT-PCR only detects the
presence of viral material, and is unable to distinguish between live virus and viral debris, which
may linger for an extended period once an individual is no longer infectious (17). CT values, as a
semi-quantitative measure of how much viral nucleic acid is present, are similarly limited. As a
result of these constraints, clinicians and researchers continue to debate the utility of CT values
for informing healthcare choices for individuals (e.g. (5,21,22)).
Despite the limitations on the use of individual-level CT values, measures of CT values
across a population may provide a useful measure of COVID-19 dynamics in the community. As
CT values have been correlated with disease stage and infectivity, a higher proportion of low CT
values in testing samples from the population may reflect epidemic growth in the community

(23). Preliminary analyses of simulation and surveillance testing data suggest that decreases in
the distribution of CT values in a population, as measured by the median CT value, may precede
a local outbreak, such that the median CT value may be a useful tool in predicting a surge
(23,24). The present study describes an exploratory analysis of potential correlations between
median CT values and COVID-19 disease dynamics, operationalized as percent positivity,
transmission rate and COVID-19 hospitalizations.

METHODS
Sample Selection
The samples in this study were collected between September 15th, 2020 and January
11th, 2021 as part of the ongoing diagnostic evaluation services provided by Dascena, Inc to
residents in the state of Texas. In the greater El Paso area, a contractor for the El Paso
Department of Public Health sends over 90% of collected samples to the Dascena COVID-19
Laboratory in Houston, Texas. The Pearl Independent Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approved this study (IRB Protocol 21-DASC-127).
This study included nasopharyngeal swabs, salivary samples, an anterior nares swabs
sample, and samples for which the type of biological specimen was not specified. The
overwhelming majority of samples were nasopharyngeal swabs. All biological samples were sent
to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified Dascena Laboratory. All
samples were analyzed with TaqPath COVID-19 Combi Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, Massachusetts), with extraction performed with a MagMAX RNA Isolation Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Three gene targets are used by these
assays, and may be the source of a positive result: the nucleocapsid (N) gene, the spike (S) gene
and the open reading frames (ORF1ab) gene (25). RT-PCR was only run once on any unique
sample. For each RT-PCR test, the CT value was recorded. Only samples that produced a valid
CT value for a positive COVID-19 test (i.e., at least 2 genes generating a positive signal with a
CT value ≤ 37) were used to determine the daily median CT value and in subsequent correlation
analyses.
Data Processing and Measures
The following demographic data were available for testing samples: age, sex, race,
ethnicity, and zip code of residence. Testing samples from the greater El Paso area were selected
based on the zip codes listed as part of the El Paso metropolitan statistical area (MSA) by the US
Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Program (26). Daily percent positivity
rate was calculated among all samples tested by Dascena from the greater El Paso area.
The effective reproduction number or transmission rate R(t), was derived using the opensource algorithm from COVID-19 tracking website rt.live (27). The algorithm is a Python script
based on a Bayesian Estimation Model developed by Bettencourt & Ribeiro (28), with slight
modification to introduce gaussian noise to the prediction. Daily new COVID-19 case data from
individual counties were obtained from the COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems

Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (1), grouped by MSA, and fed into
rt.live’s algorithm to generate a time series for R(t). The daily number of individuals hospitalized
with COVID-19 in the El Paso area was derived from publicly available data produced by the
Texas Department of State Health Services that are grouped by trauma service area (29).
Comparative Analysis of Population-level CT Values
In order to contextualize the results, a focused literature search was performed for peerreviewed publications and pre-print manuscripts on the use of CT values measurements across a
population as a means of predicting or monitoring COVID-19 outbreaks. Three pre-prints were
identified (23,24,30). The datasets from the present study and the pre-prints were then compared
in terms of: source population; type of testing; sample size; biological sample types include;
duration of study period; gene target(s) of RT-PCR tests; CT-based value(s) measured; metrics
used to measure COVID-19 outbreaks; and the outcomes of study.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted in Python (31) using the following packages: pandas,
matplotlib, plotly, scipy and statsmodels. The daily median CT value among Dascena test
samples, the daily R(t) in the El Paso MSA, and the daily count of hospitalized individuals with
COVID-19 in El Paso were plotted over time. Rolling 7-day averages of the daily median CT
value (with a minimum 5 days of data present in the window), the daily R(t), the daily number of
COVID-19 hospitalizations, and the daily percent positivity among samples from El Paso sent to
the Dascena Laboratory were also plotted over time. To better capture the dynamic change in
percent positivity among Dascena test samples, the daily change in percent positivity was
calculated from the 7-day rolling average for days with more than 200 total tests performed by
the Dascena Laboratory. If fewer than 200 tests were performed on a particular day (e.g., due to
holiday shut down of collection sites), the percent positivity from the previous day was carried
forward. The daily change in percent positivity was then plotted over time.
Scatterplots and linear regression were used to evaluate possible associations between the
daily median CT value (N gene) and daily R(t), between the daily median CT value (N gene) and
the daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, and between the daily median CT value (N gene)
and the daily change in percent positivity among samples processed by Dascena. Since a
significant time delay was observed between changes in the daily median CT value (N gene) and
the daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations, a time lag of 33 days was applied to the
hospitalization data prior to creating the scatterplot and conducting linear regression. The median
CT value based on the N gene was selected because it has previously been cited in research on
population CT values (24,30).
In order to evaluate whether a time delay existed between changes in the daily median
CT value (N gene) and community outbreaks, cross correlation plots were constructed between
daily median CT value and daily R(t), between daily median CT value and the daily count of
patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and between daily median CT value and the daily change

in percent positivity. In brief, a cross-correlation coefficient was obtained by dividing the
correlation between two signals to the product of auto-correlation of each of the two signals. The
argmax of the cross-correlation coefficient is the dominant lag time between the two signals. As
the purpose of the present analysis was to investigate how the trough of daily median CT
correlated with the peak of the other signals, to aid visualization the following modifications
were made: (1) for each signal, the z-score was used instead of the absolute value; (2) the
negative value of the z-score of daily median CT value was used to ensure a positive peak in the
cross correlation plots; (3) 20% of positive samples were randomly sampled five times each day
to estimate the variation in the cross-correlation between daily median CT value and
epidemiological signals. A 1-sample t-test was used to determine if the mean lag differed
statistically significantly from the zero.
Pairwise comparisons were performed with Pearson’s correlation (significance P < 0.05)
to determine if any demographic factors associated with testing samples were significantly
associated with R(t), COVID-19 hospitalization count, or percent positivity. The following
demographic factors were investigated: daily number of tests; daily median age; daily percent
samples from men; daily percent samples from individuals indicating White race; daily percent
sample from individuals indicating Hispanic ethnicity.
RESULTS
In the greater El Paso area, 148,410 COVID-19 tests were sent to the Dascena Laboratory
for processing, and 36,306 tests were positive. 147,720 (99.54%) of samples were
nasopharyngeal swabs, 28 (0.02%) were salivary samples, 1 sample (0%) was an anterior nares
swab, and 661 samples were biological specimens (0.45%) for which the type of specimen was
not recorded. The median CT value (N gene) for nasopharyngeal samples was 23.14, which
differed significantly from the median CT value (N gene) observed for all other sample types of
25.58 (p < 0.05, Mood’s median test). The demographic characteristics of the entire population
tested for COVID-19 are presented in Table 1.

Variability over time was observed in the median CT values and measures of COVID-19
disease dynamics in El Paso (Figure 1). As predicted based on the a priori hypothesis, the daily
median CT was negatively correlated with the daily R(t), daily count of COVID-19
hospitalization (with a time delay), and the daily change in percent positivity among testing
samples in the greater El Paso area (Figure 2).

R(t) and percent positivity plots over time (Figure 1) suggested that peaks in R(t) and percent

between median CT and change in percent positivity or R(t).

The dataset in this study was substantially larger than those used in comparator studies,
but differed in that it was not a surveillance sample. Instead, this study used samples from
individuals who required testing due to the presence of COVID-19 symptoms, or who required
testing in the absence of symptoms (e.g. for work or travel clearance). Median CT value was the
most common measure of population distribution of CT values across research studies to date,
and R(t) and percent positivity were the most common outbreak measures (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
At present, surges are largely predicted based on observed local case and mortality rates,
which may lag by several weeks behind changes in transmission rates or be obscured by changes
in testing capacity (23). Given the ubiquitous availability of CT data and the pressing nature of
the pandemic, interest has risen in exploring the possibility that the population distributions of
CT values can be used as indicators for local outbreaks. The current study adds to the growing
literature on this topic by providing an analysis of median CT values from samples collected
from an entire geographical area, and contextualizing the results with a comparison to other
research investigating the application of population CT values.
In the greater El Paso area, daily median CT values were found to be negatively
correlated with the daily percent positivity among samples, the daily R(t) extracted from
community case rates and the daily count of COVID-19 hospitalizations (with a delay). Of note,
these associations were not observed in supplementary analyses (Supplementary Figure 1;
Supplementary Figure 2; Supplementary Figure 3) conducted for different Texas MSAs for
which substantially fewer tests, covering a smaller proportion of the population (Supplementary
Table 1), were processed. There appeared to be greater day-to-day variability in the median CT
values over time rather than consistent trends in the MSAs evaluated in supplementary analyses,
potentially reflecting differences in the strength of the signal that could be detected. In addition,
substantial differences in the study populations may have contributed to variable significance of
the relationship between median CT value and outbreak measures between study sites. This
hypothesis is supported by the observation of significant demographic differences between El
Paso MSA and the Texas MSAs evaluated in the supplementary analyses (Supplementary
Table 2). This observation indicates that certain qualities of datasets used to measure population
CT values may be important to their utility to approximate local COVID-19 surges.
Changes in the population distribution of CT values significantly preceded a rise in
COVID-19 hospitalizations in El Paso. However, contrary to the a priori hypothesis that changes
in CT values would precede surges, the cross-correlation plots of median CT value, percent
positivity and R(t) did not strongly demonstrate such a relationship. It therefore remains unclear
from the data whether changes in the population distribution of CT preceded changes in
community transmission, or vice versa. Other studies evaluating population CT values in
surveillance samples have reported that changes in CT values may precede traditional signs of an
outbreak (23,24). The inclusion of symptomatically indicated tests in the sample population may
have influenced this association, such that a decline in CT values may be more closely linked to
current case rates.
Strengths
Strengths of this study include that all RT-PCR analyses were conducted at a single
laboratory using standardized testing protocols, and that large samples of positive COVID-19
tests were acquired for the study site. The vast majority (>99%) of samples were nasopharyngeal
swabs, such that differences in median CT values based on sample type likely did not impact

results. This study was not limited to a single medical center, but included samples collected
from an entire geographical area. This research compared median CT values to R(t) and
hospitalization count, traditional public health used benchmarks to define surges, providing
greater validity than would be possible with only an internal comparison of different metrics of
testing sample data. In addition, this study provided a novel examination of the features of RTPCR testing data which may contribute to and affect the usability of population-level metrics of
CT values for predicting disease dynamics in the community.
Limitations
While the study sample was large, other variables and forms of bias (e.g., sampling bias),
may have influenced the results. Indeed, differences in the comprehensiveness of the El Paso
dataset versus the supplementary site datasets-or in, other words, the relative proportion of tests
conducted by the Dascena laboratory versus other testing providers-may have contributed to
skew in the supplementary samples. Future directions for research on population CT values may
therefore include analyzing whether significant differences in results can be detected in different
sub-samples of tested populations, and evaluating methods to collate CT data across testing
providers in a given geographic area.
No data on symptomatology was associated with samples at the time of collection, such
that these data do not enable a distinction between samples collected as part of clinical
evaluation of symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or for other reasons (e.g., clearance for work
or travel). Prior research assessing population distribution of CT values in relation to community
outbreaks has explicitly used surveillance samples (23,24). The variability in the observed
correlations between median CT and outbreak measures in El Paso versus other testing locations
may reflect, in part, variability in the proportion of symptomatically indicated versus nonsymptomatically indicated tests in a given location. However, other differences between the
testing site populations may also have contributed to the observed variability in the relationship
between median CT value and outbreak measures, such as differences in the demographics of the
tested population. The research question of whether median CT values derived from all testing
data, versus only surveillance testing data, may be reliably used to predict disease outbreaks
remains unresolved, and can only be addressed using datasets in which symptomatology at the
time of testing or reason for testing may be linked to test results.
The samples used in this study were not collected expressly for the purposes of public
health surveillance or research, and so the demographic composition of the sampled population
varied day to day. As indicated by Table 2, some aspects of the daily demographic composition
of the tested population were found to correlate with epidemiological outcomes. Daily variability
in the sampled population may therefore translate to variability in the strength of the associations
between median CT and measures of disease dynamics. However, these associations may also
reflect underlying epidemiological trends, such as the disproportionately high rates of COVID-19
infection among Hispanic individuals (32), including during outbreaks. Additional research with

real-world samples may build on this work by further exploring the relevance of demographic
factors to the accuracy and utility of population CT measures.
CONCLUSIONS
As national, state and local authorities continue to refine public health programs to track
and contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is imperative to optimize methods for predicting
surges in community transmission. Greater lookahead time would enable local and state officials
to enact public health policies to mitigate an anticipated surge, and would provide health systems
with the opportunity to initiate changes to their standard operating procedures, including
activating reserve clinical personnel, procuring additional resources to the extent possible, and
converting facilities to support additional patient flow. The population distribution of CT values,
as measured by the median CT value, is a potential indicator for local outbreaks, which merits
further investigation.
