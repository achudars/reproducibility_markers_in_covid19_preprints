ABSTRACT
Background
China reported the Novel Coronavirus at the end of the year 2019 which was, later on, declared a Pandemic
by the WHO. Proper hand hygiene was identified as one of the simplest most cost-effective Covid-19
control and prevention measures. It is therefore very important to understand the compliance of the
community to hand hygiene.
Method
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of Makerere
University and residents of Katanga slum from 17th to 22nd of March, 2020. An interviewer guided
questionnaire with questions on knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers to hand hygiene was used in
data collection. The collected data was analyzed using Microsoft office excel 2016 and STATA 15
software. A 95% confidence interval was used and statistical significance was P<0.05.
Results
Only 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene. 11.7% of the university students had
good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude
while 50.1% had a moderate attitude to hand hygiene. University students were 6.3 times (OR: 6.3,
95%C1: (2.1 – 18.5), P=0.001) more likely to have good knowledge while Katanga residents were 3.6
times (OR: 3.6, 95%C1: (1.5 – 8.4), P=0.003) more likely to have good attitude to hand hygiene. Only
19.6% accomplished all the seven steps of handwashing. 38.4% of the participants still greeted by
handshaking and 60.1% noted lack of soap as a barrier to hand hygiene and 62.9% reported having more
than three barriers to hand hygiene. Participants that had been taught handwashing were more likely to
have better hand hygiene knowledge and practice.
Conclusion
Despite a fair attitude, deficiency of knowledge coupled with many barriers such as Lack of soap hindered
the Practice of proper hand hygiene. Public health involvement to promote hand hygiene must be
promoted.

BACKGROUND
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness that ranges from the common
cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) (1,2). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that had not been
previously identified in humans until the end of 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (3,4). The 2019nCoV can transmit among humans (5,6) and as of 29th May 2020, there were 5,701,337 cases and 357,688
deaths globally (7). Among other forms of spread, a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
object that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes (8,9).
Handwashing with soap can reduce the risk of acute respiratory infections by 16% to 23% (10). WHO and
the Uganda Ministry of Health recommend Hand hygiene as one of the essential means to prevent the
spread of all infections and in particular COVID 19. Other measures recommended include maintaining
social distance, avoiding crowds, practicing respiratory hygiene, avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth,
keeping up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, self-quarantine, cleaning frequently
touched surfaces, and seeking medical care in case of symptoms (11,12). The promotion of safe hygiene
is the single most cost-effective means of preventing infectious disease (13). During a global pandemic,
one of the cheapest, easiest, and most important ways to prevent the spread of a virus is to wash your
hands frequently with soap and water (14–16).
The promotion of hand hygiene behavior is a complex issue (17,18). Reasons for non-compliance with
recommendations occur at individual, group, and institutional levels (19). Individual factors such as social
cognitive and psychological determinants (i.e. knowledge, attitude, intentions, beliefs, and perceptions)
provide additional insight into hand hygiene behavior (20). Perceived barriers to adherence to hand
hygiene practice recommendations include inaccessible hand hygiene supplies, forgetfulness, lack of
knowledge of guidelines, insufficient time for hand hygiene (21). Despite considerable efforts, compliance
with hand hygiene as a simple infection-control measure remains low (22) and hygiene is suboptimal in
both community and healthcare settings in African countries (23).
Several studies have compared different hand hygiene methods in hospital settings (21). In contrast, few
studies have been published on the effect of hand hygiene on bacterial contamination of hands in the
community(24,25). Makerere University, the largest university in Uganda is one of the high-risk areas of
COVID-19 transmission due to factors like a large student and staff community (26). The university is
surrounded by several communities including Katanga slum which is located between the main campus
and the Medical school. These are high concentration areas with a high risk of community transmission
of COVID 19. This research served to identify gaps in the knowledge, attitude, and practices and barriers
regarding hand-hygiene among the Makerere University students and Katanga slum residents. The results
from this study are very useful in paving a way for comprehensive intervention for successful behavior
change programs on measures for the implementation of proper hand hygiene.

METHOD
Study design and setting
We employed a descriptive cross-sectional study design among the Makerere University medical students
and non-medical students residing in halls of residence. Data was also collected from the residents of
Katanga slum, a settlement located in the valley between Mulago Hospital and Makerere University and
its map can be accessed on https://goo.gl/maps/fqMmkk6cR1k4pNVbA. The study included only
undergraduate students and Katanga slum residents aged 18 years and above who were able to understand
English or Luganda languages.

Data collection
Data were collected from 17th to 22 March 2020 using an interviewer-administered structured
questionnaire. The original English questionnaire was also translated into Luganda, the local language
spoken by residents of the Katanga community. Before using the tool, the Luganda tool was translated
back to English to check for consistency. Data were collected on sociodemographic characteristics,
knowledge, attitude, and practice of hand hygiene, and barriers to proper hand hygiene.

Data analysis
Data was entered using epicollect5 software. This was after a thorough check for completion. The data
were exported and analyzed using Microsoft office excel 2016 and STATA 15 software. Frequency
distribution and percentages were used to analyze data in univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
9 parameters were used to assess the knowledge of patients on hand hygiene. Participants who got 8 to 9,
6 to 7, and below 6 correct answers were taken to have good, moderate, and poor knowledge respectively.
To measure attitude to hand hygiene, a 5 point Likert scale analysis was used to strongly agree with 5,
Agree with a 4, Neutral with a 3, Disagree with a 2, and strongly disagree with a 1. 4 parameters were
used to assess the attitude to hand hygiene (total score of 20). Bloom’s cut-off of 80% was used to
determine the attitude of the participants >=80% (16) and above, 60%>= X<80% (12 to 15) and <60%
(11 and below) were taken to have good, moderate and poor attitudes respectively. The practice of
participants on hand hygiene was assessed based on how they greet in the era of COVID 19 and their
ability to demonstrate the 7 steps of handwashing. The barriers of participants to hand hygiene were
assessed on 6 parameters
Association between participants’ knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers was represented in odds ratio
with a 95% confidence interval using multivariate analysis. For all tests conducted in this study, a
statistically significant Level was accepted at p<0.05. Spearman’s coefficient correlation was used to
assess the relationship between knowledge and attitude to hand hygiene. The data set can be accessed via
a link provided in the Supplementary Materials section.

Ethical Considerations
Ethical approval to conduct the study was obtained from the Mulago Hospital Research and Ethics
Committee. The approval to conduct the study within Katanga Slum was obtained from the Chairpersons
of both Busia and Kimwanyi Zones. The enrolment of participants into the study was voluntary and only
after written informed consent is sought from the participant. The participants had the right to withdraw
from the study at any time. Identification numbers instead of names of the respondents were used during
the research and the data collected were treated with the utmost confidentiality

KNOWLEDGE
Only 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene. All these were young adults (18 to
35 years). All participants above 35 years of age had poor Knowledge of hand hygiene. 11.7% of the
university students had good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 22.2% of year five
students had good knowledge compared to 3.2% of the year students (Table 2). On multivariate analysis,
University students were 6.3 times (OR: 6.3, 95%C1: (2.1 – 18.5), P=0.001) more likely to have good
hand hygiene knowledge than Katanga residents. There was no significant difference in knowledge on
hand hygiene between medical and no medical students. The Spearman’s correlation coefficient between
the year of study for university students and the knowledge on hand hygiene was 0.1720, showing a poor
positive relationship. The religion, age, and sex of participants did not affect the level of knowledge on
hand hygiene.
227(63%) of the participants had received prior teaching on hand hygiene and 49% of them had been
taught by a health worker. The highest percentage of those trained, 48% had received this training more
than 3 months ago. 23.8% of those with teaching on hand hygiene had moderate to good knowledge
compared to 9.8 of those that have no training on hand hygiene

Receiving teaching on hand hygiene increased knowledge by 2.9 times (OR: 2.9, 95%CI: (1.5 – 5.5),
P=0.002). How long ago the teaching was delivered did not affect the level of knowledge and neither did
the person who delivered the teaching. University students were 3.1 times (OR: 3.1, 95%C1: (2.0 – 5.0),
P=0.000) more likely to have had a teaching on hand hygiene than Katanga residents.
Social media was the most common source of information about hand hygiene as a prevention measure
for COVID 19 followed by television, 38.7%, and 28.1% respectively. The commonest source of
information among Katanga residents was television (51.8%) followed by radio (25.9%) while among
university students, the commonest source of information was social media (52.6%). However, the source
of information did not affect the level of knowledge of hand hygiene.

ATTITUDE
Overall 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude to hand hygiene. The biggest percentage, 50.1% had
a moderate attitude to hand hygiene (Table 3). Multivariate analysis showed that Katanga residents were
3.6 times (OR: 3.6, 95%CI: (1.5 – 8.4), P=0.003) more likely to have a good attitude to hand hygiene than
Makerere University students. The college of students and the study year did not affect their attitude to
hand hygiene. Although bivariate analysis showed that participants that had been taught hand hygiene
prior were 1.8 times (OR: 1.8, 95%C1: (1.1 – 3.0), P=0.024) more likely to have good attitude to hand
hygiene, there was a poor positive relationship between knowledge of the participants and their attitude
to hand hygiene due to a spearman’s correlation coefficient of 0.0734.

PRACTICE
138 (38.4%) of the participants were still greeting by handshaking while 149 (41.5%) of the participants
greeted with only facial expressions. Only 70 (19.6%) were able to demonstrate all the seven steps of
handwashing while 144 (40.2%) demonstrated less than three handwashing steps. Knowledge and attitude
of participants on hand hygiene did not affect the way they were greeting in the era of COVID 19 at the
time of the study. Participants who demonstrated all the seven steps of handwashing were 9.2 times (OR:
9.2, 95%C1: (4.3 – 20.0), P=0.000) likely to have been taught handwashing than those who demonstrated
less than three steps or demonstrated handwashing without soap use of soap. This had a Spearman’s
correlation was 0.3630 showing a fair positive relationship.

BARRIERS
The biggest barrier to hand hygiene was lack of soap, detergents, alcohol-based hand rub, or antiseptic,
reported by 211 (60.1%) of the participants. The most common barrier among university students was
lack of soap and or antiseptics, 66.4% while negligence was the most common barrier in Katanga
residents, 59.6%. The largest percentage of the participants 62.9% reported having more than three barriers
to hand hygiene, (Table 4). University students were 5.3 times (OR: 5.3, 95%C1: (1.6 – 17.6), P=0.006)
more likely to have many barriers to hand hygiene than Katanga residents

DISCUSSION
COVID 19, is a global pandemic with a high transmission rate (27). One of the best measures to address
the spread of COVID 19 is adherence to proper hand hygiene practice (14). It is therefore important to
understand the knowledge, attitude, and practice of high-risk areas to hand hygiene. Together with
establishing the existing barrier to hand hygiene, solutions can be formulated on proper infection
prevention to limit the spread of COVID 19 in the communities.
Overall, only 8.4% of the participants had good knowledge of hand hygiene, a finding that is similar to a
study in India and among medical students at Kampala International University (28,29). 11.7% of the
university students had good knowledge compared to 0.9% of the Katanga residents. 63% of the
participants had ever received teaching on hand hygiene, this left 37% of the participants without prior
teaching on hand hygiene. This demonstrated the need for health education on hand hygiene to address
this gap. 23.8% of those with teaching on hand hygiene had moderate to good knowledge compared to
9.8% of those that had no training on hand hygiene This knowledge was not affected by who delivered
the teaching and or when it was delivered. This concluded that any person with hand hygiene knowledge,
is positioned to deliver information to another individual and this should be promoted. The commonest
sources of information on hand hygiene as a control measure for the spread of COVID 19 were Social
media (38.7%), Television (28.1%), radio (11.4%), etc., in descending order. This shows the importance
of these forms of communication in connecting with communities (30,31) and this should be used to
promote hand hygiene in this pandemic.
The study found that 29.0% of the participants had a good attitude and 50.1% had moderate attitudes to
hand hygiene which is similar to a study among Kampala International University medical students who
were found to have a positive attitude to hand hygiene (29). A high number of Makerere University
students 25.9% were found to have a poor attitude to hand hygiene compared to Katanga slum residents
9.8%. This can be explained by the poor positive relationship between attitude and hand hygiene
knowledge.
All the social demographic characteristics did not affect the knowledge and attitude of participants to hand
hygiene except their location, a finding that is similar to a study among Chinese adults (32). Amidst the
growing worldwide incidence and the fact that Uganda had already registered the index case of COVID
19 (33). Our study established that 38.4 % of the participants were still greeting by handshaking and/or
hugging. This showed a poor hand hygiene practice among these participants and subsequent high risk of
community transmission of COVID 19. Only 19.6% of the participants were able to demonstrate the 7
steps of handwashing. Participants who had been taught had hygiene were 9.2 times more likely to
demonstrate all the seven steps than their counterparts, showing the importance of hand hygiene education
and promotion as a means of improving its proper practice (21).
The commonest barriers to hand hygiene were lack of soap, lack of soaps, antiseptics, detergents and
alcohol sanitizers (, lack of running water and negligence findings that are no different from a study by
Muiru (29) and a study by Al-Naggar which showed that laziness was the main barrier (34). The majority
of the patients had more than three barriers to hand hygiene. This is a very big public health problem that
limits proper hand hygiene and which is the single most effective protective measure against COVID 19
(11–13), and it needs to be addressed.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The majority of the participants had poor knowledge of hand hygiene. However, many of the participants
had a moderate attitude to hand hygiene. The practice of hand hygiene was found to be low and the
majority of the participants faced more than three barriers to hand hygiene with the most common barrier
being lack of soap, detergent, or antiseptic. The knowledge and attitude to handwashing were found to be
influenced by the location of the participants. The study also established that 37% of the participants had
never received teaching on hand hygiene. These findings show that a lot has to be done if had hygiene is
to be effective as a measure to prevent the community spread of COVID 19.
Based on this study, more public health involvement is needed to promote hand hygiene. This can involve
health education campaigns on social media, television, and radio stations since they are the safe ways of
communication in times of such a pandemic like COVID 19. The hand hygiene health education can
further be scaled to community campaigns when the pandemic is over. We recommend that equipped hand
washing facilities are set up in communities and institutions, this should be done to address the several
physical barriers that affect proper hand hygiene. Studies should do be carried out to find solutions to the
solutions.
