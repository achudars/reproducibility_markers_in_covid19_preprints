Abstract
Objective: There is growing evidence of, and biological plausibility for, elevated levels of
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), being related to lower rates of severe
infection. Accordingly, we tested whether pre-pandemic HDL-C within the normal range is
associated with subsequent COVID-19 hospitalisations and death.
Approach: We analysed data on 317,306 participants from UK Biobank, a prospective
cohort study, baseline data for which were collected between 2006 and 2010. Follow-up
for COVID-19 was via hospitalisation records and a national mortality registry.
Results: After controlling for a series of confounding factors which included health
behaviours, inflammatory markers, and socio-economic status, higher levels of HDL-C
were related to a lower risk of later hospitalisation for COVID-19. The effect was linear (pvalue for trend 0.001) such that a 0.2 mmol/L increase in HDL-C was associated with a
corresponding 9% reduction in risk (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.91; 0.86, 0.96).
A very similar pattern of association was apparent when COVID-19 mortality was the
outcome of interest (odds ratio per 0.2 mmol/l increase in HDL-C: 0.90; 0.81, 1.00); again,
a stepwise effect was evident (p-value for trend 0.03).
Conclusions: These novel results for HDL-C and COVID-19 events warrant testing in
other studies.

Introduction
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has traditionally been linked with coronary
heart disease and stroke.1 While conventional epidemiological studies consistently
demonstrate that elevated levels of this cholesterol fraction confer protection against
vascular events,2 support for such a gradient has been lacking in people genetically
predisposed to low concentrations of HDL-C,3 Mendelian randomisation studies,4 and
randomized clinical trials utilising HDL-C–elevating medication.5

More recently, HDL-C has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other health endpoints,
including infectious disease. While most investigators testing the link between HDL-C and
infection have done so in prognostic studies of patients groups,8 in one of the few cohort
analyses of apparently healthy individuals, people with lower levels of baseline HDL-C
experienced a greater subsequent risk of hospitalisation for gastroenteritis, urinary tract
infection, and bacterial pneumonia.9 Plausible mechanisms include the HDL-C–mediated
sequestration of pathogen-associated lipids, and regulation of immune cells proliferation,
maturation, and function which results in neutralization or clearance of pro-inflammatory
endotoxins.7

This evidence base raises the possibility of a link between HDL-C and COVID-19, the
disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Using UK Biobank,
a prospective cohort study, we have recently shown that an unfavourable pre-pandemic
vascular risk factor profile – low HDL-C included – is associated with a higher risk of
hospitalization for COVID-19.10 Whether HDL-C across the normal range offers predictive
capacity for COVID-19 hospitalisations is, however, untested, and this is the purpose of
the present study. Further, as the present pandemic has unfolded, this cohort has

accumulated sufficient deaths from this disease to facilitate analyses with the aim of
corroborating any associations with hospitalisations.

Methods
Study population
We used data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study,11 baseline data collection
for which took place between 2006 and 2010 across centres in the UK, yielding a sample
of 502,655 people (448,919 from England) aged 40-69 years. Ethical approval was
provided by the North-West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0382;
16/NW/0274).

Baseline data collection
At baseline, non-fasting venous blood samples were drawn and assayed for total
cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides using a Beckman Coulter AU5800 analytical
platform. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol values were calculated using the
Friedewald equation.12 Total blood count (leukocyte, platelet, haemoglobin) as markers of
immune function were analysed using an automated Coulter LH 750. Physiciandiagnosed cardiovascular disease (heart attack, angina, stroke), diabetes, cholesterollowering drugs use, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, highest educational attainment,
ethnicity,13 number of people living in the household, and physical activity in the prior
month were self-reported using standard enquiries.14 Body mass index was computed
using direct measurements of height and weight using the usual formulae.15 Hypertension
was defined as elevated measured blood pressure (≥140/90 mmHg) and/or use of antihypertensive medication. Townsend index of neighbourhood deprivation was based on
postcode linkage.14 Provided by Public Health England, data on COVID-19 status in

hospitalised patients in England covered the period 16th March until 31st May 2020. Tests
were performed in accredited laboratories on samples from combined nose/throat swabs
using real time polymerase chain reaction. Participants were also linked to long-standing
national mortality records from which death from COVID-19, our outcome of interest, for
the period 1st March to 30th September 2020, was denoted by the emergency International
Classification of Disease (version 10) code U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified).

Statistical analyses
We used logistic regression analyses to compute odds ratios with accompanying 95%
confidence intervals to summarise the relation between HDL-C and later COVID-19
hospitalisation or death. In a first analytical approach, we created an HDL-C variable with
eight categories which was designed to examine the shape of the HDL-C–COVID-19
relationship (<1.0 [referent], 1.0 to <1.2, 1.2 to <1.4, 1.4 to <1.6, 1.6 to <1.8, 1.8 to <2.0,
2.0 to <2.2, ≥2.2 mmol/L); in the analyses of COVID-19 deaths, the latter two categories
were collapsed owing to a lower number of events. With preliminary analyses suggesting
a linear gradient, we were then able to summarise the relationship for a unit change in
HDL-C (0.2 mmol/L increase). In taking both approaches, we first adjusted for age and
sex (comparator model) and then, in the multivariable model, a series of covariates which
included inflammatory markers, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic circumstances.

Results
In 317,306 (171,466 women) participants with complete data on baseline covariates, there
were 869 hospitalisations for COVID-19 (427 in women) during the surveillance period. As
illustrated in figure 1, in age- and sex-adjusted analyses, relative to the group with the
lowest concentration of HDL-C, those in the highest experienced around one third of the

risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.31; 0.19,
0.52). There was also evidence of a stepwise relationship (p-value linear trend <0.001)
such that lower disease risk was apparent in people with higher level of this cholesterol
fraction. Summarising this trend, a 0.2 mmol/L increase in HDL-C was associated with a
15% lower risk of subsequent hospitalisation (0.85; 0.82, 0.89). Adjusting for an array of
confounding factors – health behaviours, inflammatory markers, and socio-economic
status – resulted in a shallower HDL-C–COVID-19 gradient but the linear association
remained (p for linear trend 0.001) with 0.2 mmol/L increase in the cholesterol fraction now
corresponding to a 9% lower risk of the disease (0.91; 0.86, 0.96).

Next, we tested the results for HDL-C and COVID-19 mortality in 317,827 participants
(171,675 women) in whom there were 232 COVID-19 deaths (79 in women) during the
surveillance period. As apparent in figure 2, the HDL-C relation with mortality was similar
to that seen in the prior analyses for hospitalisations. Thus, after controlling for age and
sex, relative to the group with the lowest concentration of HDL-C, those individuals in the
group with the highest HDL-C concentration (≥2.0 mmol/L) had less than half of the risk of
death ascribed to COVID-19 (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.40; 0.21, 0.76).
Again, there was evidence of a dose-response effect across the full range of HDL-C
values (p-value for trend 0.0003) whereby an increase in HDL-C of 0.2 mmol/L produced a
15% lower risk of mortality (0.85; 0.78, 0.92). As apparent from the breadth of the
confidence intervals for several point estimates, however, some of these analyses had
lower precision owing to the lower number of deaths. Although multiple adjustment for
covariates led to attenuation of the magnitude of the HDL-C–death relation, the shape
apparent in the minimally-adjusted analyses was retained (p-value for trend 0.03); an
increase of 0.2 mmol/L was associated with a 10% lower risk (0.90; 0.81, 1.00).

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the shape of the
relationship between pre-pandemic HDL-C levels and risk of later COVID-19 events. Our
salient finding was that, net of an array of confounding factors, higher concentrations of
HDL-C were associated with protection against hospitalisation for, and death from, the
disease. That COVID-19 events ascertained using different approaches revealed very
similar effects increasing confidence in our novel results. In other analyses from the
present dataset we have reported what are now regarded as established associations of
classic vascular risk factors such as raised levels of glycosylated haemoglobin,16 body
weight,15 and blood pressure10 with COVID-19, as apparent in studies based in the US,17
Italy,18 China,19, 20 and Brazil.21 We have also shown higher rates of hospitalisation for the
disease in people of increased age, male sex, socioeconomic disadvantage,14 and ethnic
minority groups.13

Comparison with existing studies
Levels of HDL-C appear to change in the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), such that, relative to healthy controls, patients with COVID-19 have lower levels of
HDL-C concentrations in conjunction with acute elevation in systemic inflammatory
markers.22, 23 While a lowering of HDL-C levels appears to be a consequence of COVID19, the reverse, whereby pre-pandemic HDL-C levels may offer some predictive capacity
for this disease, has been little examined. Taking a Mendelian Randomisation approach,
investigators using UK Biobank data have shown an inverse association between baseline
HDL-C and hospitalisations for any infectious disease up to 10 years later.24 In contrast,
using a conventional epidemiological study design, analyses based on two Danish

community-based, prospective cohort studies with up to 20 years of follow-up revealed a
‘U’-shaped relationship whereby the greatest risk of hospitalisation for any infection was
apparent at opposing ends of the HDL-C continuum.9 There was no clear evidence of
such a quadratic effect in the present study. Studies linking with respiratory disease and
earlier measurement of HDL-C are scarce and we are unaware of any other analyses with
COVID-19 as the endpoint.

Mechanisms of effect
Potential mechanisms for the HDL-C–COVID-19 gradient include the anti-inflammatory
properties of the lipoprotein which are related to lower risk of cardiovascular disease in
humans,25 particularly relevant in COVID-19 complications. Further, HDL-C can act as a
direct modulator of immunity by inhibiting haematopoietic stem cells proliferation and
affecting the activity and function of immune cells by changing the cholesterol content of
the lipid rafts in immune cell membranes.7 A direct binding and neutralization of viral
particles by HDL-C may also underpin the observed association.26

Study strengths and weaknesses
The strengths of this study include the measurement of biomarkers that preceded the
onset of COVID-19, so ruling out reverse causality. While large, the study sample is also
well-characterised. That UK Biobank participants represent only 6% of the target
population, however, means that the present data cannot be used to estimate prevalence
or incidence in the general population, although established risk factor associations
appear generalisable.27 HDL-C levels were measured up to 14 years before COVID-19
case assessment and this raises concerns about their utility for current values, however, in
a reassessment a mean of 4.4 years after baseline examination they showed high test-

retest stability (correlation coefficient 0.85, p<0.001) in a subsample (N=13,430). While
the HDL-C–COVID-19 gradient was robust to the adjustment of various covariates, it is
plausible that unmeasured confounding factors might explain the association. To this
extent, because the data are observational, we cannot be dogmatic about causality.
Further scrutiny of our results, including the application of the Mendelian Randomisation
approach where a genetic proxy for HDL-C is used as the exposure of interest, is required.

In conclusion, the novel association between higher levels of HDL-C and lower risk of
hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 warrant testing in using other study designs.
