Summary
The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), identified in China at the end of the December 2019 is
causing a potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19), has meanwhile led to outbreak
all over the globe. India has now become the third worst hit country globally with 16,38,870
confirmed cases and 35,747 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 as of 31 July 2020. In this
paper we have used mathematical modelling approach to study the effects of lockdowns and
un-lockdowns on the pandemic evolution in India. This, study is based on SIDHARTHE
model, which is an extension of classical SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. The
SIDHARTHE model distinguish between the diagnosed and undiagnosed cases, which is very
important because undiagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the virus than diagnosed
individuals. We have stratified the lockdowns and un-lockdowns into seven phases and have
computed the basic reproduction number R0 for each phase. We have calibrated our model
results with real data from 20 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. Our results demonstrate that
different strategies implemented by GoI, have delayed the peak of pandemic by approximately
100 days. But due to underdiagnosis of the infected asymptomatic subpopulation, a sudden
outbreak of cases can be observed in India.
Keywords: COVID-19 pandemic, Mathematical modelling, lockdowns and un-lockdowns,
reproduction number, India.
Introduction
Throughout the human history, infectious deceases have been causing morbidity and mortality.
In the last week of December 2019, an infectious disease, causing potential fatal respiratory
syndrome, was identified as the novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, the capital of
Hubei, China. COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2

(SARS-CoV-2) [1-2]. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11
March 2020[3].
India reported its first case of COVID-19 on 30 January 2020, followed by two cases in the
month of February, with travel history to COVID-19 affected countries [4]. In March, the
transmission grew after several native people and tourists with travel histories to affected
countries, and their contacts, tested positive. As the pandemic progressed through the world,
Indian government responded with thermal screening of passengers arriving from COVID-19
affected countries. In March, the Indian government issued recommendations regarding social
distancing and imposed travel restrictions. On 22nd March, the Government of India (GoI)
announced complete lockdown in 82 districts of 22 states of the country where confirmed cases
were reported. On 24th March, the Prime Minister of India announced a complete 21-day
national lockdown 1 to contain the pandemic. Lockdown 2 was announced on 14th April for 18
days, with conditional relaxations in areas with lower spread from 20th April. On 29th April,
the Government issued guidelines for the states to allow inter-state movement of the stranded
people. On 1st May, GoI extended lockdown till 17th May, with some more conditional
relaxations on the basis of red, orange and green zones. On 17th May, GoI announced another
lockdown from 18th to 31st May, with some additional relaxations. The red zones were further
divided into containment and buffer zones. GoI issued guidelines on 30th May to reopen the
country in various (three) phases from 1June onward. The first phase of reopening was termed
as "Unlock 1.0" and permitted shopping malls, religious places, hotels and restaurants to reopen
from 8 June. Phase II of Unlock began on 1st July with night curfews. The lockdown measures
were only imposed on containment zones [5].
The first human coronavirus outbreak was recorded in 1965 - HCoV-229E, followed by two
outbreaks of similar capacity - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in 2003 and 2012, respectively
[6]. The SARS-CoV-2 is identified as beta-coronavirus belonging to the family of
Coronaviridae. Unlike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 shows peculiar
epidemiological traits [7]. The COVID-19 transmission depends upon the susceptible
population and its infectious agent. Its transmission dynamics can be studied with the help of
mathematical models to quantify the possible disease control and mitigation strategies. Several
mathematical models have been developed to predict the dynamics of infectious diseases [813]. SIR is a widely used deterministic model that describes human to human transmission in
three stages: Susceptible(S), Infected(I) and Recovered(R)[14]. Lin et al. exploited
SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) to capture the course of COVID-19 in
Wuhan, China [15]. For Covid-19 transmission in India, Mandal et al. developed an extended
SEIR model for optimistic and pessimistic scenario [16]. For optimistic scenario the basic
reproduction number (R0) was 1.5 and in pessimistic scenario, R0 was 4. Various mathematical
models have been used to predict the COVID-19 pandemic in India [17-21]. Giordano et al.
extended classical SIR to SIDARTHE model [22] to predict the course of epidemic in Italy.
Their model incorporates the population wide interventions and their effects on infection
spread.
In the present study, we generalized the SIDARTHE model to the Indian scenario of COVID19 that incorporates four phases of lockdown and two phases of un-lockdown. The main
novelty of this model lies in including both detected and undetected cases. We have considered
both, diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the community. Variability in the
transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic population has been taken into account
for every lockdown and un-lockdown period. Basic reproduction number has been computed
using next generation matrices. We also estimate the basic reproduction number R0 for different
phases of lockdown and un-lockdown. Effects of different strategies on the pandemic dynamics
have been analyzed by varying the corresponding parameters. Model results have been
calibrated with data (from 20 March to 31 July 2020) for cumulative infected cases, cumulative
recovered and cumulative deaths.

Material and Methods
The data
We have collected the data for diagnosed infected cases, diagnosed recovered and total deaths
due to COVID-19 in India for the period of 20 March to 31 July 2020. The real time data for
cumulative infected cases and deaths is obtained from WHO website [27]. Data for recovered
cases is obtained from relevant sources [28]. Model results have been compared with the real
data for total infected cases, recovered cases and total deaths.
Mathematical formulation of COVID-19 pandemic
We have exploited the SIDARTHE model [22] to see the effects of different lockdowns and
un-lockdowns on the number of cases of COVID-19 in India. The total population is
subdivided into eight epidemiological classes: S, Susceptible (not infected class); I, Infected
(Asymptomatic not detected class); A, Asymptomatic (infected detected class); Su,
Symptomatic (infected not detected class); D, Detected (infected detected class); C, Critically
ill (infected detected class); M, Mortal (detected infected dead class); R, Recovered (detected
and undetected infected class). There are very few peculiar cases getting reinfected, but the
rate of reinfection is negligible [23], so we haven’t considered the case of recovered people
becoming susceptible again. A flowchart of interaction among different classes is shown in
figure1.
Time evolution of the population in each class is described by the system of eight ordinary
differential equations:

Qualitative analysis of the Mathematical Model:
The basic reproduction number, R0 is the most important measure which quantifies the disease
invasion or extinction in a population [24]. In this section we obtain the basic reproduction
number for our model using Next Generation Matrix (NGM). The NGM is the natural basis for
the definition and calculation of R0 where finitely many different categories of individual are
recognised.
The basic Reproduction number (R0):
The basic reproduction number R0 is arguably the most significant quantity in infectious
disease epidemiology. It is the average number of secondary infections produced by a typical
case of infection in a population where everyone is susceptible. R0 provides insight when
designing control intervention for established infection.
The above system of differential equations (1-8) is compartmental system and has the mass
conservation property [25] i.e.,

hence, the sum of the states (total population) is constant.
Since the variables denote population fraction, we can assume:
S(𝑡) + 𝐼(𝑡) + 𝐴(𝑡) + 𝑆0 (𝑡) + 𝐷(𝑡) + 𝐶(𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡) + 𝑀(𝑡) = 1

where 1 denotes the total population.
This system (1-8) has five infected states, I(t), A(t), Su(t), D(t) and C(t) and three uninfected
states, S(t), R(t) and E(t). At the infection free steady state, I(t)= A(t)= Su(t)= D(t)= C(t)=0 with
S(t)+ R(t)+E(t)=1. Hence linearization of equations corresponds to infected states, lead to the
linear system

Results
The outbreak of COVID-19 in India has been considered for the numerical simulations. The
model parameters have been estimated based on data about the evolution of the pandemic in
India in the period from 20 March 2020 to 31 July 2020. The impact of different
countermeasures to prevent the spread has been discussed, based on the model calibration.
Numerical simulations have been performed to compare the predictions of mathematical
models with the real data. MATLAB 2019b has been used to simulate and analyse the results.
For the study, the timeline of the various steps implemented by the GoI has been divided into
seven parts i.e. phases. The first phase comprises of the time from March 20th, to March 24th,
i.e. right before the implementation of the first nationwide lockdown announced by the GoI for
21 days from March 24th. This is taken as the Second Phase. This in turn is followed by the
next, third phase, viz. the lockdown implemented from April 15th to May 3rd, with certain
relaxations from April 20th. The lockdown was extended yet again on May 1st, by the order of
GoI, and the Fourth phase of our study shall comprise of the time duration from May 4th to
May 17th. May 18th to May 31st, marks the final phase of lockdown which shall be considered
as the Fifth phase. Following these, the process of un-lockdown started in the country, from
June 1st to June 30th, which shall comprise the sixth phase of our study. And the final phase i.e.
Un-lockdown 2, began on July 2nd till July 31st with night curfews and lockdowns limited to
containment zones only. This shall be our Seventh Phase [5].
The initial point of our simulation is 20 March 2020 (day 0), when India had already 195
confirmed cases reported. The initial conditions for the fraction of population in each stage is
fixed as: I =11000/population, A =419/population, Su =10/population, D =50/population, C =0,
R =0, M =0, S =1 –I –A –Su –D –C –R –M. The parameters are set as: z =0.30, h =0.189,
µ =0.0181, n =0.0284, t =0.0035, l =0.03, r =0.03, k =0.0160, V =0.0120, s =0.0160. Values
of the parameters for different phases are given in Table 2.
The basic reproduction number for Phase1 is R0 =1.9730, which leads to a significant growth
in the number of infected individuals.
In Phase 2, (after day 4), due to strict nationwide lockdown, basic social distancing and GoI
recommendations (washing hands often, not touching one’s face, avoiding local gathering and
keeping distance) the transmission of the disease was significantly reduced. The basic
reproduction number is R1 =0.9003 for Phase 2.
In Phase 3, (after day 25), GoI announced another nationwide lockdown with some relaxations
from 20 April, which increased the disease transmission. Testing capacity of the country was
also increased. Resulting basic reproduction number is R2 =0.9958 for this phase.
In Phase 4, (after day 43), GoI extended the lockdown with some additional relaxations. The
country has been split into three zones: red, orange and green zones. Various activities were
allowed depending on the zone. GoI allowed stranded people to return their hometowns, which
increased the transmission significantly. Testing capacity was also increased in this phase. The
basic reproduction number for this phase is R3 =1.0834.
In Phase 5, (after day 57), there was another lockdown announced by GoI with some more
relaxations. In this phase red zones were further divided into containment and buffer zones.
Depending upon zones, various activities were allowed. Due to plasma therapy and other

therapeutic medicine, recovery rate was also improved. Basic reproduction number for phase5
is R4 = 1.0727.
In Phase 6, (after day 71), GoI announced reopening of the country in a phased manner with
economic focus. Lockdown restrictions were only imposed in containment zones, while
activities were allowed in other zones in limited mode, with night curfews (shopping malls,
religious places and hotels were allowed to reopen from June 8). Basic reproduction number
for phase5 is R5 = 1.1340.
In Phase 7, (after day 101), the second phase of the reopening began in the country. Lockdown
measures were only imposed in containment zones. In all other areas most of the activities were
allowed with night curfews. Basic reproduction number for phase 7 is R6 = 1.1431 [5].
Figure 2A, depicts the pandemic evolution predicted by the model with the estimated
parameters up to 140 days. Solid lines represent the actual evolution of the pandemic (all cases
of infection, both diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases, although the non-diagnosed cases are
not counted in the data) and dashed lines represent the diagnosed pandemic evolution (all the
cases that have been diagnosed and thus are reported in data). Figure 2A shows that in the
earliest pandemic phase, the number of infected cases was underestimated. In the seventh
phase, approximately 20 percent of the total cases were undetected. Figure 2B predicts the
infected cases categorized into: non-diagnosed asymptomatic (ND AS), diagnosed
asymptomatic (D AS), non-diagnosed symptomatic (ND S), diagnosed symptomatic (D S) and
diagnosed with terminally ill (D IC). Figure 2C shows the long-term pandemic evolution over
a 350-day horizon. This figure predicts that 23 percent of the population will contract the virus
till 350th day. The number of infected people will peak around 325th day, while the peak of
diagnosed cases will occur around 340th day. Figure 2D represents long-term evolution of the
infected subpopulation reaching its peak value. The comparison between the data and the
prediction from the mathematical model is reported in Figures 3. The model predictions have
been fitted on the data from 20 March 2020 to 31 July 2020 (till phase 7). Figure 3A shows
the comparison for model results and official data for cumulative infected cases. There is some
difference in model curve (blue line) and official data, due to the inconsistent reporting of cases
in the official data. Figures 3B and 3C represent the comparison between official data and
model predictions for recovered cases and for mortal cases respectively.
If there were only social distancing countermeasures taken without any nationwide lockdowns,
the model predicts that 50 percent of the population could have contracted the virus till 150th
day. Figure 4 represents the evolution of pandemic without any lockdown with social
distancing measures only. Figures 4A and 4C show the short term and long-term pandemic
evolution with social distancing measures only, respectively. Figure 4B and 4D predicts the
short term and long-term evolution of pandemic for infected subpopulations with social
distancing measures only, respectively.
Discussion:
In the present study, we have considered a generalized SIDHARTHE model to quantify the
effects of different lockdowns and un-lockdowns on the time evolution of COVID-19
pandemic in India. This model incorporates both diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases. The
parameters were estimated by fitting the model predictions to the official data.
For the phase1, the transmission of the diseases was very high in the absence of lockdown and
social distancing measures. But in the phase2, there was strict nationwide lockdown, to curb
the spread of COVID-19 and reproduction number (R1) significantly decreased from 1.9370 to
0.9003. Figure 2A shows that until 25th day there was very moderate increase in the curve of
cumulative infected cases. From phase3 to phase5 reproduction number gradually increased
from 0.9958 to 1.0727. Figure 2A shows that infected cases also increased gradually from 25th
day to 71st day. In this timeline the recovery rate of the country also improved and curve
representing recovery rate also started rising. With the reopening of country in phase6 and
phase7, number of infected cases increased rapidly. Figure 2A shows that curve of cumulative

infected cases increased sharply in this time. Figure 2B and 2D are delineating the short-term
and long-term evolution of infected subpopulations respectively with their peaks.
The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases allows us to reckon the deviation
between actual and reported diseases statistics (i.e. total infected individuals, total recovered
cases, total mortality and the transmission rate). The discrepancy between actual infected
(diagnosed and non-diagnosed) and official data of infected (diagnosed only) can be quantified
based on this model, There were some misperceptions in the early phase of pandemic due to
lack of information (many asymptomatic cases were not diagnosed), which leads to the
underestimation of infected cases. Modelling results quantify the approximate error in
estimating the actual number of infected cases due to inadequate number of tests being
performed. The model predictions help us to explain the long-term effects of insufficient
number of diagnostic tests, with sudden outbreak after a long silent period. Figure 2C shows
the exact similar scenario of insufficient number of diagnostic tests, after the 200th day there is
a sudden outbreak in cases in India.
Once the parameters were estimated by fitting the model results to the clinical data, long-term
pandemic evolution can be reproduced. The modelling results help us to assess and predict the
effects of implementation of different strategies and protocols (i.e. first four nationwide
lockdowns, extensive screening of disease, un-lockdowns). Social distancing measures are
modelled by reducing the infection coefficients. Our simulated results show that different
strategies implemented by GoI, have significantly delayed the peak of infected individual
subpopulations. In Figure 4C, the peak of cumulative infected cases occurs very early in
comparison to the Figure 2C. Figure 2D shows that nationwide lockdowns have also delayed
the peak of critically ill infected people.
Conclusion
In this paper, we have used SIDHARTHE model to discuss the potential effects of different
strategies implemented by GoI on the pandemic evolution. Both, detected and un-detected
cases are taken into the account. Main outcomes of the of the performed study are as follows:
The basic reproduction number R0 decreased significantly for the second phase due to strict
lockdown, but started increasing in the upcoming phases due to the various relaxations. The
peaks for different infected subpopulations are considerably delayed. Underdiagnosis of the
infected asymptomatic subpopulation will lead to sudden outbreak of cases in India. Without
lockdown the peak of cumulative infected cases could have occurred very soon with drastic
mortality rate. Our modelling results can be used for constructing efficient strategies to prevent
the further spread of coronavirus in India. Our study also points out that policies such as social
distancing and quarantine of the exposed population alone are not sufficient enough to end the
COVID-19 pandemic in India and its states. Other stringent policies like complete lockdown
as well as more testing of susceptible populations should be considered and must be
incorporated systematically in mathematical models.

Figure2: The pandemic evolution predicted by the mathematical model for the COVID-19
outbreak in India. A: the short-term pandemic evolution obtained by estimating the parameters
based on the comparison of real time data with the model results for diagnosed cases. B: the
different infected subpopulations for short-term horizon C: the long-term predicted evolution
of the pandemic. D: the curves distinguish between different infected subpopulations for longterm horizon. The solid lines represent the actual evolution of the pandemic (this refers to all
cases, both detected and undetected) and dashed lines represent the diagnosed pandemic
evolution (this refers to all cases that have been detected and reported in the data).
