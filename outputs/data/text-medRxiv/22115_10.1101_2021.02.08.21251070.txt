ABSTRACT

Introduction: Statins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible
mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic
review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin
usage.

Methods: Literatures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies
that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality,
ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the
subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies
reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately.

Results: Thirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis.
Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of
mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62,
95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis
were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75).
The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR
0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality
relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88).

INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, the first outbreak of a novel human coronavirus infection named severe acute
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China1. The
SARS-CoV-2 then rapidly spread across the globe, manifesting a high incidence of COVID-19
disease; on March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic2.

The pathophysiology that underlies the severe COVID-19 pneumonia is an overproduction of
early response proinflammatory cytokines, namely tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6 and IL1β3. If left unattended, this cytokine storm could place COVID-19 patients at a higher risk of
vascular hyperpermeability, multiorgan failure, and death3. Moreover, cholesterol has been
implicated to have a possible role in an increased risk of infection in the elderly patients, wherein
higher tissue cholesterol has been shown to increase the endocytic entry of SARS-CoV-2.
Statins, with its mechanism of inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA)
reductase inside cells, may reduce such a cytokine storm, as it stabilizes the protein myeloid
differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) at normal levels, and also up-regulates
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is reported to be downregulated by SARSCoV-2 and decrease infiltration of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells4-6.

Several studies have reported on the use of statins amongst COVID-19 patients with differing
conclusions. Zhang et al7 reported that the use of statin was associated with reduced mortality,
while Cariou et al8 reported an opposite association with an increased mortality. Other studies
such as De Spiegeleer et al9and Song et al10 reported no difference in mortality between statin

and non-statin users. Further studies, or meta-analyses are sorely needed to pool study results and
increase statistical power, to achieve a better understanding of the potential effect of statins.

Meta-analyses by Hariyanto et al11 and Kow et al12 have studied the association between statin
use and mortality among COVID-19 patients. However, while they analyzed several studies on
the association between statins and adverse outcomes on COVID-19 patients, neither metaanalyses comprehensively reported on all studies conducted to-date of their publication. Further,
neither paper distinguished studies on the circumstances around statin use; specifically, whether
included studies in their meta-analysis reported on patients who used statin prior to
hospitalization and statins after hospitalization.

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse
outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage.

METHODS
Search Strategy
Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched
from January 2019 to December 2020, for English-language publications. The search strategy is
presented in Appendix 1.

Study Screening
Studies underwent level 1 title and abstract screening to identify articles that reported on the use
of statins among COVID-19 patients. Relevant articles from level 1 screening subsequently

underwent level 2 full-text screening. This step identified studies that reported on a clinical
database for which adverse outcomes were reported. Reference lists of articles undergoing level
2 full-text screening were also assessed (i.e. backward reference searching), to identify other
potentially relevant studies.

All screening was done independently by two reviewers (RC, JI). Where there were
disagreements, a discussion occurred and consensus was achieved to determine whether to
include or exclude an article. Where consensus could not be achieved, a third author (NC) was
consulted for their input and final decision.

Quantitative Synthesis
Articles identified for inclusion after level 2 full-text screening were assessed for quantitative
synthesis. Articles were included if they reported an adjusted relative risk measure on mortality,
ICU admissions or mechanical ventilation of patients who were statin users compared to those
who were not statin users (comparison group).

For studies included at this stage, demographics such as sample size, study design, patient
population, central measures of tendency for age, percentage male, and percentage of statin users
were noted. We noted whether studies reported exclusively on ICU patients at the time of
enrollment. Additionally, we assessed if statin use was defined as prior to or after hospitalization.

In corollary to study screening, quantitative synthesis was conducted independently by two
reviewers (RC, JI), and a third reviewer (NC) was consulted if consensus was not achieved.

Statistical Analyses
Meta-analysis was conducted for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status (ICU Patients, and
Non-ICU Patients) and statin usage (Statin Use Before and After COVID-19 Hospitalization).
Studies employing similar relative risk ratios were analyzed together to generate a summary risk
estimate. That is, studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) were aggregated to produce a summary
odds ratio and studies reporting a hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed together. Corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CI) for an OR or a HR are reported as well. When there was heterogeneity
of I2 of equal to or greater than 50%, a random-effects DerSimonian-Laird analysis model was
applied; otherwise, a fixed-effects inverse-variance analysis model was used. A p-value of less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

A funnel plot and Egger’s test were used to assess the publication bias for the endpoint of
mortality. A p-value of greater than 0.05 indicated a lack of asymmetry of the funnel plot, and
thereby no significant concern for publication bias. All analyses were conducted using Stata 16.

RESULTS
A total of 482 records underwent level 1 screening, of which 474 were identified through
database search and 8 identified from backward reference searching. After removing duplicates,
346 records underwent level 1 screening; 49 articles subsequently underwent level 2 screening.
Twenty-one studies were assessed for quantitative synthesis, of which 13 studies7-10,13-22,
presenting on 14 cohorts, reported relative risk ratios adjusted for potential confounders and were
included in this systematic review and meta-analysis (Appendix 2).

Study demographics are presented in Table 1. All studies were observational in design, with
either a retrospective cohort study design or a case-control study design. Israel et al16 split their
database into two cohorts and reported two relative risk ratios for the outcome of mortality. Two
studies, Grasselli et al14 and Rodriguez-Nava et al20, reported on ICU patients; the other 11710,13,15-19,21,22

reported on non-ICU patients. Six studies7,10,17,18,20,21 defined a statin user as one

who used statins after a COVID-19 hospitalization; seven studies8,9,13-16,19,22 defined a statin user
as one who used statins before a COVID-19 hospitalization.

Visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger’s test (p = 0.086) suggests no significant concern
for publication bias (Appendix 3).

Mortality
Twelve studies compared mortality between statin users and non-users. Individuals who had
used statins prior to COVID-19 hospitalization had a similar risk of mortality to those who did
not use statins – HR of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.28) and OR of 0.62 (95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). COVID19 patients who had statins administered after their COVID-19 hospitalization had a lower risk
of mortality compared to those who did not receive statins – HR of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.61) and
OR of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.75) (Figure 1a).

COVID-19 patients who were using statins and admitted to the ICU did not show a lower risk of
mortality, compared to non-statin users – OR of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU

patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users – HR of 0.53
(95% CI: 0.46, 0.62) and OR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.88) (Figure 1b).

ICU Admissions
Two studies reported on ICU admissions by patients who did and did not use statins. The risk of
ICU admissions was similar between patients who used statins before COVID-19 hospitalization
and who did not use statins, according to Yan et al – OR of 1.78 (95% CI: 0.54, 5.13). It was
also similar between patients who used and did not use statins after COVID-19 hospitalization,
according to Song et al – OR of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.67).

Mechanical Ventilation
Cariou et al reported the odds of mechanical ventilation to be 0.99 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.41), when
comparing statin to non-statin users.

DISCUSSION
This is the first rigorously conducted systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the
association between statin use and adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients, meeting the
methodological guidance for a high quality systematic review and meta-analysis as
recommended by the MOOSE group23. With thirteen cohorts reporting on 110,078 patients in
total, this meta-analysis has much greater statistical power than the meta-analyses of Hariyanto et
al11 and Kow et al12. The analysis by Hariyanto et al11 reported on 9 studies and an amalgamated
sample size of 3,263 while Kow et al12 reported on 4 studies and a total sample size of 67,333.

Furthermore, this review employs different statistical methodologies than the prior reviews.
While Kow et al12 jointly meta-analyzed study outcomes of mortality and severity together, we
separately analysed the outcomes of mortality and ICU admissions. This review also differs from
the Hariyanto et al11 paper in that we meta-analyzed adjusted relative risk ratios, while they
meta-analyzed unadjusted event data. As all the studies employ an observational study design,
covariate distributions of statin user and non-user groups may not necessarily be similar as one
would expect in a randomized controlled trial. A meta-analysis of adjusted relative risk ratios
excluding unadjusted results is necessary.

The results suggest that individuals with and without history of statin use before their COVID-19
hospitalization experience a similar risk of mortality, ICU admissions, and use of mechanical
ventilation. However, we urge caution around this simple dichotomy of studies and the
corresponding interpretation. Depending on the time sequence of events, we hypothesize there
are four possible scenarios of statin use within these included studies (Figure 2):
(1) Patients who used statins prior to COVID-19 hospitalization and who continue to use
statins after hospitalization
(2) Patients who used statins prior to COVID-19 hospitalizations and who cease to use of
statins after hospitalization
(3) Patients who have no history of statin use prior to COVID-19 hospitalization and start
using statins after hospitalization
(4) Patients who have no history of statin use prior to COVID-19 hospitalization and do not
receive statins after hospitalization

As statins are not currently a recommended medication for COVID-19 treatment and there is no
randomized controlled trial in this setting, one could assume that Scenario 3 is unlikely to happen
given its intent to solely treat COVID-19 with statin.

In the event that Scenario 3 did occur, patients in Scenario 3 who only used statins after COVID19 hospitalization may have acute cardiovascular indications for statin use after hospitalization,
such as those who may develop acute myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome or stroke. Our
analysis by statin use before COVID-19 hospitalization therefore compares patients who used
statins prior to COVID-19 hospitalization who may or may not continue using statins (Scenarios
1 and 2) after hospitalization, to patients who did not use statins prior to COVID-19
hospitalization who may or may not start statins after hospitalization (Scenarios 3 and 4). The
data reporting on non-statin users prior to COVID-19 hospitalization would therefore include
more patients with poorer outcomes (Scenario 3), and result in an overestimation of the possible
protective association between statin use before hospitalization and adverse outcomes.

Along a similar vein, the possible protective association of statins prior to COVID-19
hospitalization and adverse outcomes may also be underestimated. Masana et al18 reported
further on Scenario 2, in which 42.2% of enrolled patients who used statins before COVID-19
hospitalization but discontinued statins during hospitalization. While the pre-hospitalization
analysis would not be affected, the hidden assumption of pre-hospitalization statin use reflecting,
or being used as proxy for, post-hospitalization statin use would be violated; the association
between statin use before COVID-19 hospitalization and adverse outcomes will underestimate
the association between statin after COVID-19 hospitalization and adverse outcomes. Hence, by

comparing studies based on whether they use statins before COVID-19 hospitalization as a proxy
for statin use after COVID-19 may result in a significant misclassification.

This review also reports that patients who used statins after their COVID-19 hospitalization were
at a lower risk of mortality and this protective association between statins use and mortality may
be underestimated. Of the four aforementioned scenarios, our comparison of statin use after
COVID-19 hospitalization may be summarized as a comparison of patients who used statins
after COVID-19 hospitalization regardless of prior usage (Scenarios 1 and 3), relative to patients
who did not use statins after COVID-19 hospitalization regardless of prior usage (Scenarios 2
and 4). Again, in the event that Scenario 3 manifested and thereby the arm of patients who used
statins after COVID-19 hospitalization experience poorer outcomes, the protective association
between statins use after COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality may be underestimated.

Masana et al also reported that patients who continued on statins had significantly better
outcomes, compare to patients who were not on statins before COVID-19 (p=0.045). In fact, our
results suggest that statin usage after COVID-19 hospitalization may have a protective
association for mortality, and our analysis supports the recommendation by UpToDate® for
“continuing statins in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who are already taking them”24.
However, prospective randomized controlled trials should further investigate whether statins
may be an effective therapy for COVID-19 patients.

Our analysis also suggests that the risk of mortality among statin users compared to non-statin
users differs, when focusing on subsets of ICU and non-ICU patients. Non-ICU patients seemed

to experience benefit from statin use, while this beneficial association was not seen among
patients admitted to the ICU. It is possible that statin has a more beneficial effect to decrease
inflammation, early in the stage of illness and among less sick patients with COVID-19.
However, there is a paucity of data with respect to ICU patients. Further investigation is required
among ICU patients, given this limited statistical power to find association between statin and
mortality, among ICU patients.

This study was not without limitations. Intrinsic to meta-analysis study designs, the strength of
meta-analysis conclusions is limited to the strength of the input studies and underlying data. As
all included studies are observational studies, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm
whether statin can be beneficial in patients with COVID-19 as COVID-19-specific treatment
agent. Additionally, there is a general paucity of literature. While there are thirteen studies
reporting on mortality, only two studied ICU patients. Only two studies reported on ICU
admissions; only one study reported on mechanical ventilation. We need further research to
address whether statin is beneficial in terms of preventing ICU admission or mechanical
ventilation, which are surrogate markers of severe COVID-19 infection.

In conclusion, patients administered statins after COVID-19 diagnosis were at lower risk of
mortality. Ultimately, all included studies in this analysis were observational and predominantly
retrospective in nature. Further prospective investigation is needed to assess whether statins may
be an effective therapy in COVID-19 patients. Continued investigation is required to assess statin
use among COVID-19 patients with respect to other outcomes, such as ICU admissions and
mechanical ventilation.
