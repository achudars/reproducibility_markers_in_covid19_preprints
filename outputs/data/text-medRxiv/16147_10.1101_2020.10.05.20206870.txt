Abstract
Background: While COVID-19 remains largely unclear and mortality continues to raise,
early effective approaches prior to complications lack, as well as researches for
characterization and therapeutical potential options in actual early COVID-19. Although
females seem to be less affected than females, hyperandrogenic (HA) phenotype, like
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia
(CAH) female androgenetic alopecia (AGA), or idiopathic HA may be at higher risk due
to its inherent enhanced androgenic activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the
effects of any early pharmacological approach to females diagnosed with COVID-19

before seven days of symptoms, as well as investigate whether HA is an additional risk
factor in this population.
Materials and methods: Females with symptoms for less than seven days confirmed for
COVID-19 through positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2)
were classified and divided as non-HA, HA, and HA using spironolactone (HA-spiro)
groups. Patients were questioned for baseline characteristics, 23 different diseases, 44
drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, and eight different parameters to
measure COVID-19 related clinical outcomes. Treatment was then provided, including
azithromycin 500mg/day for five days in all cases, associated with hydroxychloroquine
400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice a day for six days, or ivermectin
0.2mg/kg/day por three days, and optionally spironolactone 100mg twice a day until cure.
Patients were assessed for COVID-19 clinical course, clinical and viral duration, and
disease progression.
Results: In total, 270 females were enrolled, including 195, 67, and eight in non-HA, HA,
and HA-spiro groups, respectively. Prevailing symptoms were anosmia (71.1%), ageusia
(67.0%), headache (48.1%), myalgia (37.4%), dry cough (36.3%), nasal congestion or
rhinorrhea (34.1%), fatigue (33.3%), weakness (29.5%), hyporexia (27.8%), thoracic pain
(24.8%), diarrhea (24.1%) and dizziness (21.5%). Earliest symptoms (days) were
dizziness (1.0 ± 0.2 day), abdominal pain (1.1 ± 0.3); conjunctival hyperemia (1.1 ± 0.5),
nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (1.2 ± 0.5), headache (1.2 ± 0.5), dry cough (1.2 ± 0.5),
myalgia (1.2 ± 0.4), nauseas (1.3 ± 0.5) and weakness (1.3 ± 0.5). Time-to-treat, positive
rtPCR, and duration of symptoms with and without anosmia and ageusia were
significantly lower in HA-spiro than non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. Time-to-treat
was similar while all duration of symptoms and positive rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 were
significantly shorter in non-HA than HA. Spironolactone users were more likely to be
asymptomatic than non-users during COVID-19. Fewer non-HA than HA females were
affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and hyporexia. Ageusia,
weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA. None of the patients needed
hospitalization or any other COVID-19 complication.
Conclusions: A sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical
approach with different drug combinations yielded irrefutable differences compared to
sex-, age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and disease-matched non-treated controls in terms
of clinical outcomes, ethically disallowing placebo-control randomized clinical trials in

the early stage of COVID-19 due to the marked improvements. HA females presented
more severe and prolonged clinical manifestations, although none progressed to worse
outcomes. Spironolactone mitigated the additional risks due to HA.

Background

COVID-19 is a multi-systemic and multi-factorial syndrome caused by the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its exact mechanisms of
action are still largely unclear, and despite the massive number of infections and deaths,
effective approaches before it becomes severe lack (1-4).
One of the most likely reasons to explain why we have failed to detect effective
approaches is that while we are searching for molecules with antiviral activity, we are
detecting COVID-19 too late, when viral infectivity no longer plays a key role in the
pathophysiology at that stage, which will naturally lead to lack of efficacy from these
antiviral approaches.
While we have focused the vast majority of the researches on patients after they
acute lung injury and hospitalized patients, a relative shortage of researches in actual
earlier stages of COVID-19, in comparison to the relevance of trying to discover effective
approaches for secondary prevention, i.e., preventions of COVID-19 complications after
its detection. Meanwhile. number of researches that allege to have researched in mild
patients actually included hospitalized patients only, which is inherently contradictory
(5).
Because of the large pre-symptomatic period, asymptomatic infected subjects,
prolonged incubation and viral shedding period, and unrevealed means of transmission,
viral spreading remains, despite all unprecedented public policies.
Yet the most characteristic and specific symptoms have been extensively
described, unspecific clinical manifestations, particularly in the first days of the disease

(since anosmia and ageusia tend to appear after three a five days only), highly
heterogeneous clinical presentation, and lack of good predictors of those who will further
develop acute lung injury are still challenges to detect COVID-19 during the period when
therapies focusing on antiviral activity may still be effective (6-9).
An additional challenge to be overcome it the persistence of policies focusing on
the sine-quo-non presence of fever or shortness of breath to perform the diagnostic realtime Polymerase Chain Reaction (rtPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (10,11). While these two
symptoms should not be considered as signs for the presence of COVID-19, but for severe
COVID-19 instead, we will fail to diagnose COVID-19 when complications are
potentially avoidable. The reports on the literature claiming that fever is present in the
majority of patients with COVID-19 are based on data collected from registers that
require fever to diagnose COVID-19, which is per se a limitation for a more accurate
description of COVID-19 manifestations. Reports based on diagnostic tools for COVID19 that do not require fever show that fever may be present in as low as 10% of infected
patients only (12-14).
Several different molecules demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity against SARSCoV-2 and have been proposed as promising therapies for COVID-19 (13), among which
the most attempted drug combinations included azithromycin in the majority of the cases,
in association with hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin or nitazoxanide (13,14). However,
since detection of COVID-19 is predominantly delayed due the mandatory presence of
fever for its suspect, antiviral approaches will be less effective, since at this stage of the
disease viral infectivity becomes less central. Accordingly, randomized clinical trials
(RCT) on alleged early COVID-19 yielded conflicting results, although the majority have
been exclusively performed in hospitalized patients (10-14).
We have concluded that pharmacological therapies for truly early and mild
COVID-19 has not been investigated thoroughly, which precludes from conclusive
findings regarding the efficacy of antiviral approaches at this stage. To evaluate potential
antiviral therapies, it is critical to detect COVID-19 during the first days after its
appearance, which is only feasible with more sensitive approaches its diagnosis.

Although underreported, risks for acute lung injury, thrombosis and other clinical
complications in COVID-19 are also related to increased exposure, enhanced activity,
and/or hypersensitivity to androgens (15-23). Overrepresentation of males in terms of
complications related to COVID-19 are not fully justified by differences in age, body
mass index (BMI), prevalence of comorbidities, i.e., there is an inherent risk related to
male sex (15-18). This is likely explained, at least partially, by the transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS-2), a critical protein for the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells, that
are largely and solely regulated by androgens. Among males, androgenetic alopecia
(AGA) as an independent predictor of complications related to COVID-19, possibly due
to a resultant of overexpression of androgen receptors (AR), due to enhanced
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, activity, response, or a combination between these
factors, that discloses AGA as a clinical phenotype expression.
While females are underrepresented among severe COVID-19 patients, risk
factors including menopause, aging, uncompensated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
hypertension and obesity seem to enhance the risk of severe COVID-19 in females more
than in males. In addition, in an analogically similar manner than AGA males, females
with any expression of hyperandrogenism (HA), including polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS), idiopathic hirsutism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21alphahydroxylase or 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency, female AGA, or idiopathic HA, have
sufficient mechanistical plausibility to support the hypothesis that this population may be
at higher risk compared to non-HA females.
In this regard, the use of antiandrogens has demonstrated promising results, as
already observed for both males and females, at least when used chronically (19-22). This
reinforces the role of the role of antiandrogen approaches as an additional path to improve
outcomes in COVID-19. Nonetheless, similarly to the use of antiviral therapies,
antiandrogens should be tested during the first stage, as it affects viral infectivity.

effective. At this point, it is uncertain whether this approach would be affective, which is
our objective.
Together, the evaluation of sex differences, as well as differences between
phenotypes within each sex, would also disclose additional information for promising
approaches for specific populations.
The objectives of the present study are to perform a thorough and comprehensive
clinical characterization of patients with COVID-19 detected through a highly sensitive
case-detection basis, and to explore the clinical responses and outcomes to a variety of
drug combinations. In addition, we aimed to detect sex-specific and androgenic
phenotype-specific clinical manifestations and outcomes. This is an open-label

Materials and methods
Subject selection
This specific study is an open label prospective observational study of the
characterization and clinical outcomes of females with COVID-19 in response to specific
therapeutic combinations. In order to detect cases during the earliest stages of COVID19, we employed a highly sensitive case-detection criteria for suspect for COVID-19. We
changed from the mandatory presence of severity or specific signs (shortness of breath,
fever, anosmia, ageusia) to the occurrence of absolutely any atypical symptom or changes
in patters of chronic symptoms, even when not supposedly related to COVID-19.
Suspected females underwent rtPCR-SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2

Assay, Abbott, USA; or Cobas SARS-CoV-2, Roche, Switzerland), and those confirmed
for SARS-CoV-2 were included.
Inclusion criteria included: 1. Confirmed COVID-19 through positive rtPCRSARS-CoV-2; 2. 18 years old and above; 3. Less than seven days of beginning of
symptoms; 4. Less than 72 hours of COVID-19 confirmation (in case COVID-19 had
already been confirmed); 4. Non use or use for less than 24 hours of any potential antiviral
drug; and 5. No previous use of glucocorticoid in the past seven days.
Design and methods
Parameters evaluated by the present study are depicted in Table 1. Females
included in the study were actively questioned for baseline and medical characteristics,
including 23 different diseases, 44 drug classes and vaccines, 28 different symptoms, in
addition to the search for HA, which includes: 1. PCOS confirmed by two of three
Rotterdam Criteria; 2. Previously diagnosed CAH; 3. Known hyperandrogenism, clinicalor biochemically; 4. Hirsutism; and 5. Female AGA. Females were then divided
according to the presence or absence of HA (non-HA group), and in case of
hyperandrogenism, use of spironolactone 100mg/day or above (HA-Spiro group) or not
(HA group).
Clinical presentations were clustered into one of the following 1. AnosmiaAgeusia dominance; 2. Dengue-like symptomatology / clinical presentation; 3. Upper
respiratory tract infection (URTI) URTI-like symptomatology / clinical presentation; 4.
Gastrointestinal (GI) infection-like symptomatology / clinical presentation; 5. Mixed
between clusters; 6. Unspecific presentation; or 7. Asymptomatic.
To fill criteria for each cluster, it has been required for:
1. Anosmia-Ageusia dominance: at least two of nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, dry
cough, self-reported perception of “sinusitis”, or self-reported perception of “sore throat”;
2. Dengue-like clinical presentation: at least three of myalgia, arthralgia, upper back pain,
conjunctival hyperemia or pre-orbital pain;
3. URTI-like clinical presentation: at least two of nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, dry
cough, self-reported perception of “sinusitis”, or self-reported perception of “sore throat”;

4. GI infection-like clinical presentation: at least two of diarrhea, nauseas, vomiting, or
abdominal pain;
5. Mixed between clusters: when there are symptoms to fill criteria for at least two clusters
6. Unspecific presentation: when there are only unspecific or insufficient symptoms to
fill criteria for any cluster; or
7. Asymptomatic.
After characterization, drug combination including azithromycin 500mg/day for
five days, with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day for five days, nitazoxanide 500mg twice
a day for six days, or ivermectin 0.2mg/kg/day for three days was then provided. The
choice between hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, and/or ivermectin was based on an
almost-random manner, i.e., randomly, except when clinical judgement considered
otherwise.

In addition, spironolactone, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, apibaxan,

rivaroxaban, enoxaparin, and glucocorticoids could have been prescribed, also according
to medical judgement.
Patients were then evaluated for: 1. Time-to-appearance and duration of each
symptom (number of days); 2. Time until full remission of symptoms, not including
anosmia and ageusia (number of days); 3. Time until full remission of symptoms,
including anosmia and ageusia (number of days); 4. Duration of positive rtPCR-SARSCoV-2 (in number of days, where rtPCR was performed every seven days); 5. Level of
clinical improvement in Days -7 to -4, -3 to -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 days, where
0 corresponds to the worst day of symptoms (scored according to the number and severity
of symptoms) and 100 means asymptomatic or entirely recovered; 6. Ability to perform
everyday activities in Days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 30 (0 = no loss of capacity and 100 = complete
inability to perform any self-care or everyday activity); 7. WHO COVID Ordinal
Outcomes Scale; 8. Brescia COVID-19 score; 9. Disease progression outcomes, including
hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death. Full raw data is available at a data
repository (https://osf.io/cm4f8/).

arthralgia (3.0 ± 2.4), diarrhea (3.2 ± 1.5), myalgia (3.3 ± 1.4), lower back pain (3.3 ±
1.5), nasal congestion or rhinorrhea (3.6 ± 1.8), upper back pain (4.3 ± 2.1), thoracic pain
(4.7 ± 2.5), hyporexia (4.8 ± 2.8), and conjunctival hyperemia (4.9 ± 2.6); and those with
prolonged duration (> 5 days), including dry cough (5.4 ± 3.5) “sore throat” (5.5 ± 1.9),
headache (5.7 ± 3.5), “sinusitis” (6.0 ± 2.6), dry eyes (6.2 ± 2.1), ageusia (7.0 ± 5.7), dry
mouth (7.0 ± 0.0), fatigue (7.2 ± 4.9) and anosmia (7.9 ± 6.2).
Similar time-to-appearance and duration: fever, “feverish”, nasal congestion or
rhinorrhea, headache, shortness of breath, “sinusitis”, “sore throat”, dizziness, thoracic
pain, lower back pain, diarrhea, nauseas, abdominal pain, pre-orbital pain, and dry eyes
and mouth. Although conjunctival hyperemia was almost five times more present in HA
than non-HA females (in terms of percentage), it did not reach statistical significance.

Anosmia and ageusia were almost absent in spironolactone users. Fewer non-HA
than HA females were affected by anosmia, ageusia, dry cough, fatigue, weakness and
hyporexia. Ageusia, weakness and myalgia lasted shorter in non-HA than HA.
Time-to-appearance was shorter in non-HA for upper back pain.

As shown in Table 8, among proposed therapeutical options for COVID-19,
besides azithromycin, which was given to all patients, nitazoxanide, hydroxychloroquine
and ivermectin were prescribed in statistically equal proportions. There were also no
differences between the percentage of additional drugs prescribed between groups (Table
9).

COVID-19 course and outcomes
Table 10 shows the average time-to-treat and the clinical and biochemical duration
of COVID-19 manifestations. Time-to-treat, positive rtPCR, and duration of symptoms
with and without anosmia and ageusia were all significantly lower in HA-spiro when
compared to non-HA, HA, and overall non-users, even when only HA-spiro females with
symptoms were included for the analysis. Conversely, while time-to-treat was similar, all
other three outcomes were significantly shorter in non-HA compared to HA.
Table 11 details the clinical course of COVID-19. Although the peak of symptoms
is apparently higher in the HA group, it did not reach statistical significance when
compared to non-HA due to the wide variability. Conversely, the recovery process seems
to be slower in this group, as evidenced by the largest differences between HA and nonHA, and between HA and HA-spiro in Days 2 to 7, which coincides with the early
response to proposed pharmacological treatments. HA-spiro group had fewer symptoms
than non-spironolactone users in Days -3 to -1 and Day 7, as well as than HA females in
Days -3 to -1 and Days 2 to 7.

As in Table 12, which depicts the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID
Ordinal Outcomes in the present population, HA females had significantly higher scores
than non-HA and HA-spiro groups in Days 0 and 7, and became similar after Day 14.
None of the patients presents as Scores 3 to 5 throughout the disease.
The loss of capacity to perform everyday activities is described in Table 13. None
of the spironolactone users had any level of loss of everyday activities. Conversely, HA
were significantly more compromised when compared to non-HA and HA-spiro females
(p = 0.004 and 0.028, respectively), by the time that proposed treatments started (Day 0).
This was mitigated in the following days (Days 3, 7, 14 and 30). Except for spiro-HA
(not affected at any time), Day 3 had significant improvement compared to Day 0.

Discussion
The importance of an early diagnosis of COVID-19
The present prospective observational study aimed to characterize patients upon
the diagnosis of COVID-19. Oppositely to the prevailing recommendations to suspect for
COVID-19 only in the presence of fever of shortness of breath, we detected COVID-19
guided by any symptom, related or supposedly unrelated to the disease. Another key
modification was the active questions, since patients tend to avoid reporting symptoms

that they do not believe to be due to COVID-19. The majority of patients had at least one
complain that would not be reported if not actively questioned.
Researches have largely focused approaches for stages two and three, while
assumed that none of proposed therapies for earlier stages would be effective (‘wait and
see’). Culturally, unlike bacterial infections, specific antiviral treatments tend to be
avoided. Except for chronic and relapsing viruses, antivirals have been studied at an
irregular basis, and their clinical use have long been avoided. Moreover, drugs for other
diseases that might disclose direct or indirect antiviral activity have been underestimated.
More important than the culture of non-viral treatment that surrounds the medical
field, is that the lack of specific symptoms and the usual presence of uncommon clinical
presentations, that likely precluded the majority of the patients from an actual early
diagnosis.
The change in the paradigm for detection of COVID-19 towards more sensitive
and active search for COVID-19 may have driven the better outcomes observed in the
present study. We consider imperative that policies for COVID-19 diagnosis change
The patient with COVID-19: characterization of the patients and the disease
Baseline characteristics were significantly different between non-HA and HA
probably because HA females tend to be shorter and present higher BMI. The differences
between age is understandable when one considers that the phenotypical expression of
HA tends to occur earlier in lifetime. Furthermore, recognition of female HA (except for
dramatic cases, as beard females) has only occurred in the last decades, and was
underdiagnosed until short time ago.
Differences in BMI between HA and non-HA was relatively lower than
differences in age, and obesity was similarly present between groups. Conversely, even
being significantly younger, HA females presented more severe manifestations of
COVID-19 than non-HA

While none of the prevailing chronic diseases presented any difference between
groups, metformin and oral contraceptives were more used in HA than non-HA females,
possibly due to the fact the PCOS is the most common underlying condition that leads to
HA.
In a similar manner of what has been observed in males, symptoms in females
could be easily clustered (23-26). At least two symptoms of each cluster were together
within a same patient in more than 80% of patients. The clusters of anosmia-ageusia
predominance, dengue fever-like, URTI-like, and GI infection-like clinical presentation
have been detected, in addition to those with unspecific symptoms, or with more than one
cluster. The remarkable URTI-like clinical symptoms among HA females may be due to
enhanced infectivity that has been shown to occur under hyperandrogenic states.
The similar number of patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and
ivermectin and the lack of major differences at least in terms of COVID-19 complications
shows that the choice for a specific medication to be added to azithromycin is not
imperative. Also, although preliminary hypotheses and data demonstrating the important
role of azithromycin as an adjuvant therapy against SARS-CoV-2, whether this drug plays
an add-on benefit effect is uncertain, and remains unanswered, since we did not compare
with versus without its use.
Correspondingly, additional drugs and supplements were given according to an
individualized clinical evaluation, and were used in similar percentages between groups.
The use of anticoagulant, specially Xa factor inhibitors and enoxaparin, were based on
the risk for thrombosis and development of other complications, since COVID-19 is a
pro-thrombotic state per se. Vitamin D, and at slightly lesser extent, zinc and vitamin C,
were prescribed to the majority of treated patients. Hence, whether these additional
prescriptions helped to improve outcomes cannot be concluded from the present study.

COVID-19 outcomes
All early COVID-19 related outcomes, including duration of positive rtPCRSAR-CoV-2 and symptoms with or without anosmia and ageusia were markedly lower
in HA-spiro when compared to non-HA, HA, and overall non-users. However, time-to-

treatment was equally lower in HA-spiro females. Hence, whether the shorter and milder
clinical presentation in COVID-19 among spironolactone users is due to earlier beginning
of treatment is unknown, although COVID-19 disease course remained better in the HAspiro group after adjustments for non-asymptomatic patients only.
Unlike HA-spiro, since time-to-treat and treatment options were similar between
non-HA and HA females, obesity prevalence was similar, and HA were younger than
non-HA, prolonged clinical and viral duration among HA females may only be explained
by the hyperandrogenism.
Although spironolactone users had more asymptomatic presentation than other
groups, when HA-spiro patients presented symptoms, these symptoms presented similar
time-to-appearance and duration than non-HA females. The great majority of the
symptoms occurred in similar percentages and presented similar durations for all groups.
Increased fatigue, dry cough and anosmia, and increased and prolonged weakness,
myalgia and ageusia found in HA females should also be explained by hyperandrogenism,
in an analogical manner than male AGA (5,6,14,16,17), due to enhanced expression of
TMPRSS-2.
Differences in disease course were more evident between Days 0 and 7 in HA
females, as this population presented slower speed of improvement compared to other
groups, as evidenced by three methods to quantify this speed (Tables 11 to 13), which
means that HA females were shown to improve, but took longer than other groups.
Despite the slower symptom regression in HA, all groups showed increased recovery rate
after initiation of any of the proposed therapies.
The importance of measuring loss of capacity to perform everyday activities lays
on the fact that infected patients remain isolated for approximately 14 days, and needs to
be able to perform the basic hygiene and self-care activities during this period. Although
HA females were more compromised than non-HA and HA-spiro females, even this
group was only slightly affected, and lasted for less than three days.
Unlike rapid clinical recovery, radiology did not show any improvement during
the first 30 days after treatment initiation. However, there is a major bias that those that

underwent more than one chest CT were those that persisted with complains or were
already compromised. Hence, radiological improvement may be less prolonged that what
has been shown in the present study.
Criteria employed to measure COVID-19 severity, ilike WHO COVID Scale and
Brescia Respiratory Scale, revealed to be inaccurate in the present analysis, since none of
the patients progressed to respiratory complications, hospitalization, and other outcomes.
Instead, more sensitive scales were better to detect differences.
Oppositely to non-spironolactone HA females, HA that use spironolactone had
markedly better clinical outcomes related to COVID-19. Additionally, the small number
of patients with COVID-19 taking spironolactone may reflect its potential preventive
effect, despite the lack of any other data to support this hypothesis. Spironolactone has
been proposed to exert multiple beneficial roles in COVID-19, including increase of
circulating-to-attached angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) ratio, increased
angiotensin receptor (AT) 2-to-AT1 ratio, decreased TMPRSS2 activity, as well as
antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities (20-22), and its promising roles have been
reinforced by the present analysis.
Post-COVID syndrome?
The importance of unveiling potential effective treatments for COVID-19 not only
lays on preventing hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, but also preventing
long-term, post-cure persisting symptoms, termed as “post-COVID syndrome”, that has
shown to be present in at least 20 to 30% of patients, and includes autoimmune, mental,
psychiatric, muscular, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, and persisted fatigue,
resembling chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), unrelated to any specific biochemical
marker to date (27,28).

Hence, whenever a pharmacological intervention study is

conducted, researchers should not only consider acute, but also chronic complications as
targets to evaluate efficacy.

The effect of specific treatments on COVID-19: comparison with existing
literature

When duration and severity of clinical symptoms, disease duration, and related
complications are compared with the extensive reports on the literature, differences are
undisputable, particularly for clinical outcomes (10-12). At least in the present population
of females, differences were sufficiently overwhelming to justify the lack of need for
placebo-control trials, from an ethical perspective. However, open label RCTs and other
prospective observational studies are mandatory to confirm the clear findings of the
present study, when compared to the expected outcomes for COVID-19 in females.
Limitations
As a prospective observational study conducted prior to a double-blind placebocontrol RCT, aiming to better determine the selection process and parameters to be
evaluated, as well as define the most plausible pharmacological approach between
hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide, ivermectin, or none. As per the study deisgn, the lack
of a placebo group initially hampers from conclusive findings. However, this has been
overcome by the evident differences when compared to the well-established COVID-19
course and outcomes, which disallows us from performing the RCT as a full placebocontrol.
The replication of a highly sensitive case-detection guidance that include the
occurrence of absolutely any symptom as being suspected for COVID-19 may find
barriers that may preclude from a successful approach, including: 1. Lack of general and
medical education regarding the unspecific pattern of COVID-19 clinical presentation; 2.
Self-judgement of not being affected by COVID-19; 3. Inability to correlate non-obvious
symptoms with COVID-19, losing the window of opportunity; and 4. Cultural focus on
the severe patient, neglecting those are possibly preventable from COVID-19
complication. Although this may not necessarily occur with all patients, the larger number
of patients treated early, the better clinical outcomes should be.

Final discussion

Since COVID-19 is an extensive, diffuse, and largely unclarified disease, a
thorough medical evaluation that encompasses questions for all organs and systems
should be performed at a regular basis, in clinical practice, not only restricted to
researching purposes.
The early detection associated with any drug combination among azithromycin,
hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide and ivermectin yielded notable improvements in terms
of course of COVID-19, when compared to literature.
Among females, presenting HA may be an additional risk for COVID-19 severity,
as they presented to be slightly more affected and had a prolonged recovery process when
compared to non-HA and spironolactone users. The chronic use of spironolactone in a
daily dose 100mg or more in HA females not only seemed to mitigate, but also reduce
risks to below those found in non-HA. This has shown to have similar relative risks when
compared to the presence of AGA and use of dutasteride among males, respectively.

Conclusion

A sensitive, early detection of COVID-19 followed by a pharmaceutical approach
with a drug combination between azithromycin in all cases, associated with
hydroxychloroquine, nitazoxanide or ivermectin demonstrated unequivocal differences
when compared to the extensively described natural disease course when
pharmacological treatments potentially effective for COVID-19 is not provided,
particularly if detected until three days after the beginning of symptoms.
When compared to non-hyperandrogenic (non-HA), HA females had a more severe and
prolonged clinical presentation, even though risk of development of COVID-19 related
complications remained unmeaningful among all groups. Spironolactone mitigated any
additional risk due to HA.
