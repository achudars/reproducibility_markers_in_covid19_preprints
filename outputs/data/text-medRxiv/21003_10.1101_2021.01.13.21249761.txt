Background

36

Invasive mould disease (IMD) – most commonly pulmonary aspergillosis - is reported to affect up to a

37

third of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Most reported cases are diagnosed with probable/putative

38

COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) based on a combination of non-specific clinical,

39

radiographic, and mycological findings, but the clinical significance – and whether these cases represent

40

true invasive disease – is unresolved.

41

Methods

42

We performed a systematic review of autopsy series of decedents with COVID-19 for evidence of IMD.

43

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, OVID (Embase) and MedRxiv for English- or French-language

44

case series published between January 1, 2019 to September 26, 2020. We included series describing lung

45

histology of ≥3 decedents, and authors were contacted for missing information as necessary.

46

Findings

47

We identified 51 case series describing autopsies of 702 decedents. Individual-level data was available for

48

430 decedents. The median age was 72 (IQR 61 to 80) years. Diabetes mellitus, pre-existing lung disease,

49

and immunocompromising conditions were reported for 129 (32%), 95 (22%), and 25 (6%) decedents,

50

respectively. The median hospitalization length was 10 (IQR 5-22) days. 51.6% of decedents had received

51

mechanical ventilation for a median of nine (IQR 5-20) days. Treatment included immunomodulation in

52

60 (most often steroids or tocilizumab) and antifungals in 41 decedents. Eleven decedents (1·6%) had

53

autopsy-confirmed IMD (6 with CAPA, 4 with invasive pulmonary mycosis not specified and 1 with

54

disseminated mucormycosis). Among 173 decedents who received mechanical ventilation, 5 had IMD

55

(2·9%).

56

Interpretation

57

Autopsy-proven IMD, including CAPA, is uncommon in fatal COVID-19.

Background

60

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome

61

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), is responsible for a devastating pandemic causing high incidences of

62

critical illness and death among infected persons around the world. In addition to direct viral invasion and

63

downstream immune dysregulation, severe disease can be complicated by secondary infections. Early

64

autopsy studies demonstrated several dominant pathological processes of the lungs including diffuse

65

alveolar damage and thromboembolism.1 Secondary infections complicating COVID-19 are reported, but

66

the prevalence of autopsy-proven secondary infections is poorly described.

67

Secondary fungal infections complicating critical COVID-19 have garnered much attention.2-5 Pulmonary

68

aspergillosis, an invasive mould disease (IMD), occurs with increased frequency following other

69

respiratory viral infections such as severe influenza, a complication that has been associated with excess

70

mortality.6,7 Similarly, COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA)8 has been reported to affect

71

up to 35% of patients with critical COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care;4,8-10 in some cohort

72

studies, CAPA has been associated with increased mortality.11,12 Risk factors for CAPA appear to include

73

prolonged ICU admission, lymphopenia, and immunosuppression including corticosteroid use.11,13,14

74

Diagnosing IMD in critically ill patients with COVID-19 can be challenging.15,16 In practice, given the

75

inherent difficulty in obtaining tissue in critically ill patients, IMD is infrequently histologically proven.

76

Host factors, required for meeting European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and

77

Mycosis Study Group Education and Research Consortium (EORTC/MSGERC) research definitions for

78

probable IMD,17 are frequently absent in ICU patients with IPA,18 including following severe influenza or

79

COVID-19. Other research definitions for diagnosing CAPA in ICU patients have been proposed and

80

include a combination of non-specific clinical, radiographic, and mycologic criteria.5,12,15 Although several

81

ICU cohort studies have suggested high rates of probable or putative CAPA, it is unclear whether these

82

cases represent true tissue-invasive disease. If they do, then IMD would be expected to be a common

83

finding in post-mortem examinations of decedents with fatal COVID-19.

84

Here we present a systematic review of autopsy studies performed in persons with fatal COVID-19 to

85

determine the prevalence of autopsy-proven tissue-invasive IMD and analyze patient-level data to assess

86

potential risk factors.

87

Methods

88

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria

89

This systematic review follows PRISMA reporting guidelines19 and the protocol was published as part of

90

a two-study review on PROSPERO (CRD42020204123). We identified possible studies by searching

91

PubMed, Web of Science, OVID (Embase) and MedRxiv for articles published from January 1, 2019 to

92

September 26, 2020. We used the terms “sars cov2” OR “covid” OR “2019 ncov” OR “novel

93

coronavirus” AND “autopsy” OR “post-mortem”. We also reviewed reference lists of eligible

94

publications for additional articles of interest as well as personal databases maintained by the authors. We

95

contacted authors of reports to obtain missing details when required or if the outcome of interest (fungal

96

infections) was not described. We only included articles written in English or French.

97

Studies met inclusion criteria if they were retrospective or prospective case series of autopsy or post-

98

mortem reports of decedents with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to minimize reporting bias

99

from case reports (either of IMD or competing diagnoses), we only included series with at least three

100

decedents. At minimum, the examination must have included histopathologic investigation of the lungs

101

either through standard or minimally invasive sampling. Studies were excluded if decedents were

102

included or excluded based on diagnoses other than COVID-19, or the presence or absence of

103

complications; or if they were not written in English or French.

104

All identified titles and abstracts were independently reviewed for potential inclusion criteria by two

105

authors (BEK and ISS) and full texts were obtained for all those aside those deemed ineligible. Full text

106

review was then performed independently by the same two authors (BEK, ISS) for final inclusion. A

107

consensus was reached for all disputes. COVIDENCE was used for abstract management (Veritas Health

108

Innovation, Melbourne, Australia available at www.covidence.org).

109

In the instance of decedents being included in more than one report, we included the study with the most

110

patient-related variables unless that which contained less individual data had a case of CAPA. If there

111

were more decedents included in the less detailed study, we still extracted data for these remaining

112

patients to add to the total cohort but did not extract any additional patient-level details. When a pre-print

113

went on to be published, we preferentially included publications and excluded the pre-prints as these were

114

not picked up as duplicate studies by our abstract manager.

115

Outcomes

116

The main outcome of interest was the number of decedents with autopsy-proven invasive mould disease

117

(IMD) determined by histopathology showing hyphae invading tissue. When available, we recorded the

118

type of mould as identified in the reports. We recorded the types of autopsies performed as either standard

119

or minimally invasive. Minimally invasive included any autopsy in which multiple lung tissue samples

120

from each lobe were obtained either blindly or through ultrasound guidance; this practice has been

121

applied frequently in COVID-19 to limit occupational exposures at the time of autopsy. We also recorded

122

study country of origin and place of death (hospitalization or community). When possible, individual

123

patient data were also extracted. We collected patient age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, duration

124

of symptoms, days of mechanical ventilation, and immunomodulatory COVID-19-specific treatment

125

prescribed (i.e. cytokine inhibitors or steroids). We used EORTC/MSGERC definitions of host factors to

126

classify whether decedents were immunocompromised.17

127

Risk of Bias Assessment

128

We did not judge the study quality given these are small case series without a target intervention. We

129

attempted to guard against selective reporting by contacting corresponding authors for any manuscript in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249761; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

130

which the outcome of interest (fungal infection) was not described. We also attempted to mitigate small-

131

study effect by including only those series with three or more cases described.

132

Role of the Funding Source

133

There was no funding source for this study.

134

Results

135

We identified 1,070 references from the database searches and 4 from alternative sources; 454 were

136

duplicates, 526 were excluded from title and abstract review and an additional 39 from full text review

137

leaving 51 studies meeting criteria for data extraction (Figure 1). Of these, six were pre-prints and the

138

remainder were published in peer-reviewed journals. All studies were published in 2020.

139

A total of 702 decedents were described across the 51 studies (Table 1).

140

Studies were included from 15 countries, most commonly from the USA (including 224 decedents), Italy

141

(146) and Germany (84) (Figure 2). Most autopsies were performed on decedents who were hospitalized

142

(n=694 [99%]) with very few from community (1%). Standard autopsy was the most commonly

143

employed technique and was used in 36 (70·6%) studies. Minimally invasive was used in 10 (19·6%)

144

studies and a combination of the two was used in five (9·8%) studies. Invasive mechanical ventilation and

145

ECMO status was missing for 155 (22%) decedents. Of the total cohort, 314 (44·7%) required invasive

146

mechanical ventilation and 15 (2·1%) were on ECMO.

147

Enough information was provided for individual-level data extraction for 32 studies describing 430

148

decedents (Supplementary Table 1). The median age was 72 years (IQR 61 to 80 years). Most decedents

149

had pre-existing comorbidities. Diabetes mellitus, pre-existing lung disease, and cancer, were reported for

150

129 (30%), 95 (22·1%), and 56 decedents (13%), respectively. Immunocompromised status was reported

151

for 25 decedents (5.8%), including solid organ transplantation in nine (2·1%), hematologic malignancy in

152

seven (1·6%), and chronic immunosuppressant use in nine (2·1%). The median duration of hospitalization

153

before death was 10 days (IQR 5-22 days). Data on mechanical ventilation status was available for 335

154

decedents: 173 decedents (51·6%) had received mechanical ventilation for a median of nine days (IQR 5-

155

20), whereas 162 (48·4%) died without mechanical ventilation. Treatment included immunomodulation

156

for 60 decedents (seven received interleukin [IL]-6 inhibitors; two received IL-1 inhibitors; one received

157

both of these drug classes; 48 received steroids; and details of immunomodulatory therapy missing for

158

one). Forty-one decedents (9·5%) were recorded to have received antifungals.

159

Among the total cohort of 702 decedents, 11 (1·6%) had autopsy evidence of IMD, including six (0·9%)

160

described as pulmonary aspergillosis, four (0·6%) with invasive mycoses not specified, and one (0·1%)

161

with mucormycosis (Table 2). Among decedents with CAPA, disease was limited to the airways in one,

162

involved only the lungs in four, and both airways and lung in one case. Of the decedents with unidentified

163

IMD, disease was confined to the airways in one, and was found in the lungs in three. In the patient with

164

mucormycosis, fungal invasion was demonstrated in lungs, hilar lymph nodes, brain, and kidney. Of 430

165

decedents with individual-level data, nine (2·1%) had autopsy-proven IMD including five (1·2%) with

166

CAPA, three with unidentified invasive moulds (0·7%) and one with mucormycosis. Decedents with and

167

without IMD that had patient-level data available are compared in Table 3.

168

Two decedents with IMD (22·2%) had pre-existing immunocompromising conditions vs 23 (5·3%)

169

without CAPA. In one immunocompromised decedent in the IMD group, the diagnosis of aspergillosis

170

pre-dated COVID-1962 (Sanjat Kanjilal Brigham and Women’s Hospital, personal communication). Only

171

one decedent (11·1%) with IMD received immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19 compared to 59

172

(13·7%) without IMD. One decedent with IMD (11·1%) was recorded to have received antifungals.

173

Discussion

174

In this systematic review of autopsy studies, we describe the prevalence of autopsy-proven IMD including

175

CAPA among persons with fatal COVID-19 infections. IMD was autopsy-proven in just 1·6% of all

176

decedents with COVID-19 and 2·9% among those reported to have received mechanical ventilation.

177

While we cannot definitively conclude that the unidentified moulds seen on autopsy studies were

178

Aspergillus, given that this is the most common cause of IMD, it is likely that most – if not all – were

179

CAPA.

180

The rates of autopsy-proven IMD are considerably lower than rates of CAPA reported from ICU cohort

181

studies. In a systematic review of ICU cohort studies, the median prevalence of CAPA was 21.1% (IQR

182

15.2-27.5%) (unpublished data). Given that post-mortem examinations are the most reliable way to

183

confirm IMD, this review provides a more robust appraisal of the true prevalence of IMD complicating

184

critical COVID-19 and suggests that the high CAPA rates published from cohort studies may be due to

185

over-diagnosis. Indeed, previous autopsy studies have shown that pneumonias, in general, were over-

186

called antemortem, and that discrepancy rates between clinical and necropsy findings were higher for

187

respiratory tract infections than for other types of infection.71

188

CAPA may be over-diagnosed in ICU studies because of a lack of specificity in the classification of

189

probable/putative and possible CAPA (which characterize the vast majority of cases reported to date).

190

Indeed, there are several challenges that ICU studies face in determining the true prevalence of CAPA.

191

Firstly, the clinical and radiographic signs of CAPA are difficult to distinguish from severe COVID-19

192

alone. Secondly, lower respiratory tract samples for diagnosing IPA are infrequently obtained in patients

193

with COVID-19 because bronchoscopy is considered an aerosol generating procedure. Thirdly, the

194

clinical definitions for CAPA are imperfect. Proven IPA – which relies on histological evidence of tissue

195

invasion - is rarely diagnosed, and given the tenuous clinical status of most affected patients, biopsies are

196

rarely performed. Established research criteria for the diagnosis of IPA, such as the updated definitions

197

from the EORTC/MSGERC17 are of limited utility for diagnosing IPA in ICU patients because host

198

factors are frequently absent.18 Moreover, classic radiographic findings seen in immunocompromised

199

hosts are uncommon in patients without host factors. Alternative diagnostic criteria have been proposed

200

and adapted for the study of influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.7,72 Several definitions have

201

been proposed for CAPA.5,12,15 However, in critically ill patients with COVID-19, radiographic findings of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.13.21249761; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

202

IMD are non-specific, serum galactomannan lacks sensitivity, and the presence of moulds in respiratory

203

samples (detected by culture, PCR, or galactomannan) can represent airway colonization. That some

204

patients with CAPA improve without antifungals argues against true invasive disease.9 Moreover,

205

Flikweert et al reported that histological evidence of IPA was absent on post-mortem examination of six

206

patients diagnosed with probable CAPA on the basis of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan (median

207

optical density index, 4·35, IQR 3·63-4·40) and, in two, respiratory culture growing A. fumigatus.37 Taken

208

together with our findings that IMD is uncommon on autopsy studies of decedents with COVID-19, these

209

data suggest that most cases of probable/putative or possible CAPA may not represent true invasive

210

disease.

211

Alternatively, CAPA has been associated with excess mortality.11 The clinical importance of Aspergillus

212

in the airways of patients with critical COVID-19 is unclear, but the low prevalence of autopsy-proven

213

IMD in such patients suggests that this finding may be a marker of COVID-19 severity and not a

214

mediator of death. Nonetheless, clinical trials are underway to assess the effect of anti-mould fungal

215

prophylaxis in critically ill COVID-19 patients.

216

CAPA has primarily been reported among critically ill COVID-19 patients, especially those requiring

217

mechanical ventilation, but it unclear whether this reflects sampling bias (enhanced surveillance and

218

access to lower respiratory samples in this patient population); confounding (Aspergillus in the airways

219

and critical illness/ventilation are both associated with COVID-19 severity); or whether critical illness

220

and mechanical ventilation truly confer increased risk of CAPA. In our study, all cases of COVID-19

221

were severe by definition, given that they resulted in death. However, only 45% of decedents had

222

received mechanical ventilation. Five of eight decedents with autopsy-proven IMD (62·5%) for whom

223

this data was available had received mechanical ventilation (compared to 168/327 without IMD [39·9%]).

224

These data suggest that IMD (including CAPA) is not confined to mechanically ventilated patients and

225

that higher rates in these patients may reflect a combination of disease severity and convenience of

226

testing.

227

Immune dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, and immunomodulatory

228

therapies like corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors (IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors) have been widely used.

229

Corticosteroid therapy is a known risk factor for IPA17 and IL-6 inhibitors could plausibly provoke IMD

230

given impaired immune response to other pathogens.73 Only one (11·1%) of the nine decedents with IMD

231

for whom treatment data was available had received these drugs, comparable to 14% in the non-IMD

232

group. Importantly, most autopsies were conducted prior to the publication of the RECOVERY trial

233

which showed dexamethasone improved mortality in patients with severe and critical COVID-19,74 and so

234

corticosteroid prescribing may have increased since then. Further study will be needed to determine

235

whether use of immunomodulatory therapy will be associated with tissue-proven IMD.

236

Post-mortem examination is the most definitive means available to detect IMD and is a particular strength

237

of this study. The presence of hyphae on histopathologic investigation is simple to detect and it is

238

therefore highly likely that the majority of these cases would have been identified. We also made every

239

effort to contact authors when histopathologic findings were not specifically described to confirm that

240

IMD had not been encountered in each case. Another strength is the inclusive nature of our review, which

241

included pre-prints, given the rapidly expanding literature in COVID-19.

242

Despite these strengths, there are several limitations of this study that should be considered. First, we only

243

included studies published in English or French, and it is possible that excluded studies could have

244

contributed further data. Second, we were confronted with limited patient information from most reports.

245

Use of antifungals was not commonly reported, and we cannot be sure whether this reflects incomplete

246

data or low rates of prescribing. Antifungal use could have reduced the sensitivity of IMD detection on

247

autopsy. The use of immunomodulators was also incompletely reported. While this would be unlikely to

248

affect the main findings, this data could be helpful in the understanding of risk of tissue-proven IMD

249

associated with these therapies. Third, although our review was exhaustive, the sample size is very small

250

compared the total number of COVID-19 deaths internationally; most decedents were included from just

251

three countries (US, Germany, Italy) and geographic variation in incidence of IMD following COVID-19

252

may occur (as it does following influenza).75 Fourth, while the use of minimally invasive autopsy

253

strategies for COVID-19 have been validated,25,33,76 random sampling rather than whole lung examination

254

may have led to under-diagnosis of IMD; it is re-assuring, however, that the majority of our included

255

cases were performed with standard technique.

256

In conclusion, autopsy-proven IMD is uncommonly reported among decedents with COVID-19. In order

257

to further our understanding of the prevalence of IMD, future autopsy studies should include patients with

258

ante-mortem diagnoses of CAPA to validate clinical definitions for this disease. Future autopsy studies

259

should specifically consider co-infections and make note of clinical diagnoses and antemortem use of

260

antimicrobials, including antifungals, and of immunomodulatory treatments.

261

Panel – Research in Context

262

Evidence before this study

263

We searched 4 databases dated from January 1, 2019 to September 26, 2020 for studies written in English

264

or French describing lung histopathology in autopsy specimens from decedents with COVID-19, with the

265

view of outlining the prevalence of tissue-invasive mould infection. Estimating the prevalence of CAPA

266

in clinical studies has been limited by scarcity of biopsies in critically ill patients, and reliance on various

267

proposed definitions that combine non-specific clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings to

268

make diagnoses of probable (putative) or possible CAPA. There are currently no published systematic

269

reviews focusing on COVID-19 autopsy cases for secondary IMD, including CAPA, which would be

270

needed to meet definitive criteria.

271

Added value of the study

272

We did a systematic review of autopsy series including ≥3 decedents diagnosed pre- or post-mortem with

273

277

potential risk factors including immunocompromised status, invasive mechanical ventilation, and

278

exposure to immunomodulatory therapy.

279

Implications of all the available evidence

280

Our findings suggest that tissue-invasive IMD including CAPA and complicating COVID-19 is rare. The

281

presence of aspergillosis on culture is not diagnostic of clinical infection and may represent colonization.

282

Further autopsy studies specifically directed at fungal super-infections would be optimal to further

283

delineate the true frequency of infection.
