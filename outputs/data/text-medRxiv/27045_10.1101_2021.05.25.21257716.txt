Abstract
Purpose
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented circumstances and changes in
behaviour. This research sought to better understand the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, and lockdown, on smoking behaviour in the UK from the perspectives of
consumers (current and former smokers) and some of their smoking-related behaviourinfluencers.

Design/methodology/approach
This research project encompassed two surveys, one for current and former smokers
(Consumers) and one for those individuals in professions with the potential to influence
smoking behaviours (Influencers). Both surveys were conducted online and were infield for
approximately two weeks during UK’s first COVID-19 lockdown. Because of the
unprecedented times the society was experiencing, several questions relating directly to
COVID-19 were added to the survey and this paper is based only on findings only from those
questions and not the whole project. The results were analysed descriptively.

Findings
A total of 954 consumers and 1027 influencers participated in the surveys. Increased
smoking was reported by 67% of the consumers mainly due to stress and boredom arising
out of COVID-19 lockdown. Consumers under 45 years of age, those in professional and
managerial occupations, and among dual users reported increased smoking in lockdown.
The COVID-19 situation changed the plans to quit smoking in 36% of consumers, with only
6% deciding to quit. Only 40% of healthcare professionals (HCPs) documented patient
smoking status in over half their interactions.

Originality/ value
This research among current and former smokers and their influencers highlights important
changes in behaviour during the COVID-19 times and underscores urgent measures to be
taken by HCPs and policymakers for staying on course of achieving smokefree goals despite
challenges posed by COVID-19.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has been high on the public agenda for much of 2020 and into
2021. Early evidence from China suggested that smokers were 14 times more likely to
develop severe complications from COVID-19 (1), a message that was promoted by Public
Health England (2). Initiatives such as ‘Quit for COVID’ from Smokefree Action were
launched during this time, attempting to use this pivotal time to encourage positive change
(3). According to research by Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and University College
London, over one million smokers in the UK quit smoking and a further 440,000 attempted
to do so, since the beginning of the pandemic (4). However, this conclusion was based on a
survey done by YouGov on a small sample population. Concerns around increased risk of
relapse and an increase in smoking rates as a result of COVID-19 measures were voiced by
smoking cessation practitioners (5, 6).
Over the last decade, the UK has made good progress in reducing the prevalence of smoking
in adults, with Public Health England (PHE) reporting a fall from 19.8% in 2011 to 14.1% in
2019 (7, 8). However, there is some way to go to achieve the stated goal of a ‘smokefree’
England (<5% prevalence) by 2030 (9, 10). At present, smoking remains the leading cause of
preventable death and disease in the UK, with approximately 1 in 6 deaths being
attributable to smoking (11).
Office for National Statistics (ONS) data suggests that the majority (62.5%) of smokers in the
UK who have ever smoked had quit in 2019, while of those who currently smoke 52.7%
intended to quit with 21.1% intending to quit in the next three months (8). Knowing that the
UK already has some of the strictest tobacco control measures in the world, it is crucial to
understand the barriers that the remaining smokers in the UK are facing to quit smoking
sustainably. To understand these barriers, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative
research study on a convenience sample of the UK’s remaining smokers and their
influencers, i.e. professionals who might have a positive influence on smokers’ quitting
journey. The overarching aim was that these findings will help to design targeted
interventions that, if implemented, could accelerate the UK’s journey to becoming
‘smokefree’.
The qualitative phase of our research helped us better understand the various stakeholder
groups and their role in the influencer ecosystem. The quantitative phase originally
encompassed two surveys, one for current and former smokers (referred to as ‘consumers’
throughout) and one for individuals in some of the professions with the potential to
influence smoking (referred to as ‘influencers’ throughout). In addition, beauticians, social
workers and barbers/hairdressers were included in the influencer group. While not
traditional influencers in this space, in times when national healthcare resources are limited,
we wanted to explore if these professions, where there are often repeated encounters with
the same individuals, could have a potential to convey healthy lifestyle messages.

Both surveys were conducted online and were infield for approximately two weeks from the
15th of May 2020 – a time when the UK was in its first lockdown.
Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peoples’ lives, the scope of the planned
survey was expanded to incorporate this. Within these surveys, several questions relating
directly to COVID-19 were included which form the basis of this paper. The overall
qualitative research and remaining quantitative survey findings will be reported elsewhere
(manuscripts in various stages of preparation).
The purpose of this paper is to better understand and communicate the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and lockdown, on current and former smokers in the UK.

Data collection
An online survey was conducted by Atomik Research among 954 consenting adults aged 18+
from the UK. The research fieldwork took place on 19-27 May 2020. Separately, an online
survey was conducted by Atomik Research among 1,027 consenting healthcare specialists
and other professionals.
During this time, the UK was under lockdown due to COVID-19 and had been since late
March, although specific rules varied between nations. However, throughout the UK,
lockdown at this time meant that citizens were advised to work from home wherever
possible and non-essential businesses were closed. These ‘non-essential’ businesses
included dental surgeries and brick and mortar vape shops.
Atomik Research is an independent creative market research agency that employs MRScertified researchers and abides by the MRS code. Respondents’ participation in this study
was anonymous, voluntary and incentivised. For both surveys, respondents were directed to
questions based on their previous answers and categorisation, therefore the number of
respondents varied per question and is often less than the total number of participants.

Data analysis
As this study was largely descriptive, no power analysis was conducted. The purpose of this
study was to better understand the perceptions and experiences of smoking cessation from
multiple perspectives as opposed to testing specific hypotheses. Results are largely
presented as averages and percentages. For qualitative results, the software programme
NVivo was used to record and structure key themes.

Results
The following section summarises the results under the following sub-sections:
- Influencer perceptions of the impact of stressful situations (such as COVID-19) on
increased smoking and relapse
- The extent of documentation of smoking status during COVID-19 by HCPs (excluding
SSAs)
- HCP perception of changes to smoking behaviours due to COVID-19
- Self-reported changes in consumer smoking behaviours due to COVID-19
- Impact of COVID-19 on consumer quit intentions
- Impact of COVID-19 on the temptation to relapse
- Self-reported changes in consumer vaping behaviours due to COVID-19
- Other self-reported challenges faced by smokers during COVID-19

Influencer perceptions of the impact of stressful situations (such as COVID-19) on
increased smoking and relapse
Overall, the majority of both HCPs (85%) and non-HCPs (82%) agreed or strongly agreed that
smokers were more likely to increase their smoking and ex-smokers were more likely to
relapse during COVID-19 (Figure 1).

The extent of documentation of smoking status during COVID-19 by HCPs
(excluding SSAs)
HCPs, excluding SSAs, were asked in what proportion of interactions (in-person, or distant)
with patients they proactively asked and documented their smoking status: 60% of HCPs
reported doing so in half or less than half of their interactions (Figure 2).

HCP perception of changes to smoking behaviours due to COVID-19
A total of 39% of HCPs were unsure as to whether their patients had increased their
smoking due to less patient contact or because they didn’t ask all patients (Figure 3), despite
their recognition of the increased risk to smokers and ex-smokers during the pandemic, as
reported previously.

Self-reported changes in consumer smoking behaviours due to COVID-19
The following results pertain to the question ‘have there been any changes to your smoking
behaviour as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown?’. 546 dual users and current smokers were
asked this question; however, 57 respondents were excluded due to contradictory
selections which prevented meaningful analysis (no change + more/less frequent, no change
+ more/fewer cigarettes, more frequent + less frequent, more cigarettes + less cigarettes,
‘other’). Multiple responses to the question were permitted, and results have been analysed
in two different ways – Table 4 treats key response combinations as separate variables,
while Figures 5-9 count the total number of responses.
Most consumers (67%) reported some kind of change to their smoking behaviour during the
lockdown, however, there is not a clear trend as to whether more increased or decreased
their smoking behaviours (Table 4). However, while 27% reported a decrease in their
smoking, only 4% of respondents decided to quit smoking during the lockdown.

When comparing the frequency of individual responses between social grades, respondents
in Grades A-C1 had higher proportions of respondents (27%-30%) who reported smoking
more cigarettes overall than those in lower grades (10%-25%; Figure 4). The majority of
respondents in Grades D & E reported no change in their smoking behaviour (52% and 59%,
respectively) (Figure 4).
A greater proportion of dual users reported an increase in the number of cigarettes smoked
during lockdown (27%) than current smokers (22%) (Figure 5). However, 34% of dual users
reported smoking less frequently during the lockdown, compared to just 16% of current
smokers (Figure 5).

A greater proportion of consumers aged 25-44 (36%-43%) reported smoking more cigarettes
in lockdown than other age groups (14%-20%; Figure 6). Total 47% of consumers aged 45-74
reported no change in their smoking habits in lockdown compared to just 18% of 18-44 year
olds (Figure 6).
Consumers who reported smoking more frequently, and/or smoking more cigarettes overall
during lockdown were asked to share the reason for this increase. The most commonly cited
reason overall was boredom (66%), followed by stress (56%) (Figure 7). However, a greater
proportion of dual users cited opportunity/freedom to smoke than current smokers (44%
compared to 27%).
Greater proportions of respondents in social grades C2 (67%), D (75%), and E (79%) selected
stress as the reason for their increase in smoking than those in higher social grades (grades
A [61%], B [43%], and C1 [52%]; Figure 8).

Impact of COVID-19 on consumer quit intentions
Overall, 36% of consumers stated that the COVID-19 crisis changed their plans on whether
to quit smoking (a sample of 546 consumers comprised of dual users and current smokers).
However, only 11 (6%) of consumers who changed their plans as a result of the COVID-19
crisis (n=195) also decided to quit during the pandemic.

Impact of COVID-19 on the temptation to relapse
Of the 408 ex-smokers including ex-smokers who now vape, 15% said that they had been
more tempted to start smoking cigarettes again during the pandemic. 55% of those in Grade
A (n=20) reported being more tempted to start smoking again during the pandemic, the
highest proportion of any social grade, followed by Grade B (n=73) at 27%. Of Grades C1
(n=114), C2 (n=57), D (n=39) and E (n=105), 15%, 9%, 5% and 8%, respectively agreed. 31%
of 18-44 year olds (n=150) agreed that they had been more tempted to start smoking
cigarettes again since the pandemic compared to just 6% of 45-74 year olds (n=258).

Self-reported changes in consumer vaping behaviours due to COVID-19
The following results pertain to the question ‘Have there been any changes to your vaping
behaviour as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown?’. Multiple responses to the question were
permitted. Thus, the total number of responses counted in Figure 9 is higher than the
number of respondents. In total 445 respondents were asked this question, however, 39
respondents were omitted from analysis due to contradictory responses (such as vaping
more + less frequently)
Higher proportions of dual users were vaping more frequently than ex-smokers who now
vape (27% vs 17%) (Figure 9). Total of 62% of ex-smokers who vape reported no change to
their vaping behaviours during the lockdown, compared to just 30% of dual users (Figure 9).
A greater proportion of dual users decided to quit vaping during lockdown (13%) than exsmokers who now vape (3%) (Figure 9).
Of the dual users who decided to quit vaping during lockdown (n=39), only 13% (n=5) also
decided to quit smoking during this period.

Despite the closure of brick and mortar vape shops, the majority of vapers were able to
access their preferred e-cigarettes and e-liquids during the pandemic (81%, n=445).

Discussion
The UK’s journey to becoming smokefree (defined as <5% smoking prevalence) can be
considered in its final laps, with a current smoking prevalence of 14%. However, it must not
be forgotten that there are specific sub-populations and socio-economic groups that
continue to have a higher-than-average smoking prevalence. This includes people in manual
occupations, adults who are unemployed and those with a diagnosed mental health
condition (8).
Our findings suggest that the government and the society’s response to COVID-19 , resulting
in changed workplace dynamics and healthcare delivery, may be having an unintentional
but substantial impact on the behaviours of consumers and the support provided by their
influencers. How this may affect long term smoking rates in the UK depends on how
consumers and influencers are able to adapt to the “new normal”, as it begins to take
shape.
Here we discuss key COVID-19 related observations from the survey and recommend
interventions to address these.
While the vast majority of HCPs believed stressful situations, such as the COVID-19
pandemic, are likely to increase smoking and relapse, they do not appear to be consistently
taking steps to address this risk. This suggests an obvious awareness-action gap. HCPs
(excluding SSAs) proactively asked and documented patient smoking status during less than
half of their interactions during the pandemic. Furthermore, a significant proportion of HCPs
were unsure of whether they had seen an increase in smoking from their patients since the
UK’s lockdown. With the exception of dentists and those shielding/unable to work, the HCP
professions surveyed were largely expected to continue practising throughout lockdown,
albeit with a shift to include significant proportion of virtual/telephone consultations.
However, the scale and speed at which HCPs needed to adapt to remote consultations was
unprecedented and may have been a totally new experience for many. Our findings suggest
that HCPs, and their patients, are facing significant barriers to addressing smoking cessation
during the lockdown. This may be due to HCPs focussing their energy on the primary reason
for a consultation and on reducing Covid-19 related direct risks, as opposed to discussing
smoking cessation as part of providing holistic care.
HCPs may benefit from training and support on how to effectively and efficiently address
and prioritise smoking cessation during remote consultations. In identifying suitable
support, learnings from practice nurses may prove valuable as they documented smoking
status most frequently. It is important that with health on the top of the public agenda with
the pandemic, established issues such as smoking are not forgotten, and instead are
addressed as vital. It should be ensured that HCPs have the knowledge and means to enable
them to document smoking status, as well as provide appropriate smoking cessation
support as per their professional role, in all appropriate patient interactions.

Two-thirds of consumers reported a change in their smoking behaviour as a result of the
COVID-19 lockdown. This is clearly a pivotal time, where new smoking habits can take hold
and the impact of lockdown on smokers cannot be underestimated. In particular, adult
smokers under 45 appear to be more at risk of changing their smoking habits and increasing
the number of cigarettes smoked than those 45 and over. This age group, as a generally
healthier age group, might not contact HCPs that often and hence might not get
opportunistic advice from them. Furthermore, an increase in smoking among younger
smokers can have a significant and long-term impact on the UK’s public health.
There is a need to take action to ensure that smokers receive appropriate support and that
this time of change is used to address smoking and prevent it from undoing years of hard
work from policymakers, HCPs and smokers themselves. Tailored interventions for different
age groups may be beneficial. We also recommend that HCPs are made aware of this issue
so they can support these people proactively, for example, by sending information on selfhelp smoking cessation tools and offering direct support via smoking cessation services.
Stress and boredom were consistently the top reasons given for an increase in smoking
behaviour during the pandemic, and the strain it inflicts should not be underestimated. This
was also recently documented in a clinical study from the United States (6). The uncertainty
of the situation, resulting in changes to daily life, job security concerns, fear of the health
impacts of COVID-19, and much more may have played a role. Healthier activities, that are
safe to do in the circumstances, including music and sports, could be explored and
promoted if suitable to help manage stress and boredom as well as directing smokers to
appropriate counselling and support. Developing and increasing access to innovative
smokefree apps that can address the behavioural component of smoking may play an
important role here. Peer support groups, while face to face meetings are difficult, can be
available on social media and the information of these on should be promoted more on
reliable national smoking cessation websites like NHS smokefree.
Greater proportions of respondents in social grades A and B (managerial and professional
occupations) reported changes in their smoking and vaping behaviours. Ex-smokers in social
grades A, B and C1 also reported being more tempted to start smoking again during the
pandemic, compared to those in grades C2, D and E. These differences between social
grades may reflect the fact that those in social grades A, B and C1 are more likely to have
experienced a transition to working from home during the pandemic, which may provide
more opportunity to smoke than in the workplace while also exposing them to different
social influences, along with stress and boredom. Furthermore, this has been a significant
change in routine which is commonly associated with behavioural habits forming. This
resurgence of smoking among the under-45 year old professionals is concerning. They are
otherwise healthy, rarely seek general practice appointments or other health advice, and if
not proactively given support to quit smoking now, could directly present with a tobacco
related disease in the near future.
The impact of such significant changes to daily life as seen during the pandemic should not
be underestimated and it is important to ensure that smokers and ex-smokers alike who
have experienced significant changes have appropriate support. Beyond policymakers and

HCPs, employers could play an important role in supporting employees who have
experienced a change in work circumstances (whether that be working from home, furlough
or redundancy) to direct them to appropriate smoking cessation support such as apps and
local services.
Around two-fifths of respondents (36%) reported that they had changed their plans to quit
smoking as a result of COVID-19. However, of those who changed their quit plans, only 6%
decided to quit during the lockdown. This is very concerning as it suggests many smokers
may have cancelled or postponed their quit plans during the pandemic. This may be due to
multiple reasons including the wrong assumption that stop smoking services might not be
functioning in lockdown, and not having enough knowledge about smoking cessation tools
to access those on their own. There could also have been concerns around accessing quit
smoking aids as COVID-19 fears and government advice may have made them reluctant or
unable to visit shops. Another potential reason is the challenge of resisting smoking when
spending so much time at home, as well as increased boredom and stress making quitting
particularly difficult and smoking particularly tempting (as seen previously). However, as this
is such an unusual but extended time there is a real risk that smokers may postpone their
quit plans indefinitely as their behaviours during the pandemic become more entrenched.
More needs to be done to support smokers who intended to quit to follow through during
the pandemic. A wider range of smoking cessation products and services should be available
for consumers to choose from. In the case of the UK, this could include apps, regulated
nicotine replacement products such as nicotine gums and e-cigarettes and in-person as well
as online support from Stop Smoking Services. Influencers can play an important role here in
being better informed about the cessation products and then advising consumers
opportunistically on quitting smoking and on preventing relapse.
Overall, 4% of smokers surveyed decided to quit smoking during the lockdown, however,
27% reported a decrease in their smoking behaviours suggesting that some smokers have
decreased their smoking during lockdown without having decided to quit. There are several
potential reasons for this including:
- Smokers may have previously decided to quit, and are progressing along with their quit
plan throughout the lockdown
- Smokers may have decided to reduce their smoking, instead of quitting fully during the
pandemic, potentially due to concerns for their health and perhaps a view that
reduction will offer certain protective benefits
- Smokers may no longer be in the environments and situations where they typically
smoked, for example, they will not have been able to visit bars and nightclubs for the
duration
- Smokers spending more time at home may be encouraged or pressured by other
members of the household not to smoke as frequently
This reduction in consumption may be a valuable step towards stopping smoking long term.
Interventions that assist people with quitting during and after the pandemic are required,
especially to support those who may be decreasing their smoking but not quitting.
Circumstances are so different and are clearly impacting people’s quit decisions, therefore it

should not be assumed that pre-COVID-19 practices are still as appropriate and effective in
these circumstances. Interventions that are adapted to the uncertainty and changed
behaviours of the pandemic are required urgently to avoid good progress from being lost
and encourage smokers to use this time of change to quit. These interventions need to take
into consideration multiple possible constraints such as another lockdown, reduced access
to HCPs and vape shops, economic uncertainty, and the emotional toll of the pandemic.
Greater proportions of dual users reported increasing their cigarette consumption during
lockdown than current smokers. Dual users were also more likely to state that the reason
for this increase was due to more freedom/opportunity to smoke at home than at work,
than current smokers. However, while almost double the proportion of dual users (34%)
reported smoking less frequently during lockdown (compared to just 16% of current
smokers), the same proportion of both groups decided to quit smoking during the
lockdown.
Dual users also appear to have changed their vaping habits during lockdown more than exsmokers who vape. Of the dual users who decided to quit vaping during lockdown only 13%
also decided to quit smoking. While the sample is too small to draw a meaningful
conclusion, this may imply that some dual users are ‘giving up’ on vaping when they no
longer have restricted use of cigarettes during lockdown at home.
These initial findings may suggest that vaping is a far more consistent habit in ex-smokers
who vape than in dual users, and that for dual users the role of vaping may be to enable
them to access nicotine in locations where smoking is prohibited - a barrier reduced for
many when they spend more time at home. While the majority of vapers were able to
access their preferred vaping materials during the lockdown, 19% faced challenges, which
may also have contributed to these changes in consumption.
Further research is warranted to understand what proportion of dual users have started
vaping with the intention of quitting smoking permanently, and what proportion would
prefer to revert to smoking exclusively if their environment permitted it. Such research may
have broader implications on how e-cigarettes are sold, regulated and marketed in the UK.
However, during COVID-19 dual users appear to be a group that would benefit from specific
interventions that encourage them to continue with vaping as a means of avoiding cigarette
consumption, and not to revert to smoking.
15% (around one in six) ex-smokers and ex-smokers who now vape reported being more
tempted to start smoking cigarettes again since the pandemic. While this is not necessarily a
representative sample, when we consider that there are an estimated 11.8 million exsmokers in England alone (Public Health England, 2018) this could mean 1.8 million exsmokers are at risk of returning to smoking. Relapse appeared to be more of a risk for exsmokers who are younger (31% of 18-44 year olds were more tempted) and/or in higher
social grades (55% of Grade A and 27% of Grade B were more tempted) highlighting the
need for specific interventions to identify and support those groups most at risk.
What is also concerning is that when this group was asked what they were doing to resist
relapse, none mentioned using typical stop smoking aids, or seeking professional help.

While only 26 responses were gathered, this could suggest that either ex-smokers are
unaware of the support available, don’t believe they are ‘eligible’ for support as they are no
longer smokers, or are facing other barriers. It is vital that the hard work is not lost and that
ex-smokers continue to be supported – work needs to be done to clearly highlight the
availability and accessibility of stop smoking aids during the pandemic. Furthermore, the
language used in quitting may suggest a certain finality when people have quit, which while
giving a sense of achievement may act as a barrier to seeking help again in the future.
If ex-smokers at risk of relapse can be supported early, this will likely be far more efficient
and effective than waiting for them to regaining their status as smokers before seeking and
offering help. There is a need for effective ways of proactively identifying ex-smokers at risk
of relapse, and interventions that can support them before they start again, not once they
relapse.
This research needs to be put into context of available smoking cessation tools and services.
It will be crucial for innovators of behavioural tools for cessation (e.g. smartphone apps) and
manufacturers of suitably regulated safer nicotine products to provide the necessary
breadth of choice and sustainable way out of smoking. (12, 13)

Strengths and limitations
This survey benefits from gaining perspectives from both HCPs and SSAs as well as a diverse
range of smokers, vapers and dual users, giving a more comprehensive view of the topic
than any one group alone.
A limitation of the study is the sample size and the sampling technique. The sample size in
this study was not representative of the population. The analyses were descriptive and the
study was not powered for statistical analysis.
Another limitation of the study is the fact that behaviours were self-reported, and
respondents were asked to explain certain behaviours. Therefore, their responses may not
reflect subconscious factors which may drive certain behaviours. Respondents may also
show some social desirability bias and demand characteristics, although the fact that the
surveys were taken individually online may have helped to mitigate these issues.
The surveys were also unable to take into consideration the emotional state of participants
as they were responding, such as the time of day and whether influencers were pre or postshift, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 crisis itself. Depending on their responses, some
respondents will have completed surveys that are longer than is typically recommended,
and therefore may have begun to experience fatigue, however, influencers in particular,
were well remunerated due to being a specialist sample. The order of the questions in each
survey attempted to follow a logical flow in order to make the surveys less mentally taxing
to complete, however, this adds the risk that respondents may have been influenced by
previous questions.
The classification of the social grade was entirely based on occupation and did not take into
consideration other factors such as household income, or educational attainment and
should be viewed critically. Furthermore, consumer and influencer groups were categorised

by self-defined responses, and it cannot be guaranteed that the most appropriate options
were selected by respondents in each instance.

Conclusions
This research among current and former smokers and their influencers highlights the
change in their behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unintended consequences of
COVID-19 related responses by the government, employers and the public may derail the
UK’s progress towards becoming smokefree. COVID-19 and its related social and health
impact may linger for the foreseeable future. The recent report by Royal College of
Physicians ‘Smoking and health 2021 A: coming of age for tobacco control?’ stated that in
2020, 80,000 people died of COVID-19 while 94,000 died of smoking related diseases in the
UK. (10) This reiterates the scale of the negative impact smoking has on people’s mortality.’
This research underscores the need to keep smoking cessation and relapse prevention top
on the healthcare agenda, with adjustments made to reflect the “new normal” reality of
health-seeking behaviour and remote clinical practice. It is crucial to continue to understand
the evolving challenges for the remaining smokers in the UK to quit smoking long term and
address those challenges head-on. This includes (i) identifying the most reliable and
trustworthy sources of guidance among the influencer networks and (ii) equipping these
influencers with accurate information and necessary tools to help smokers on their quitting
journey.
