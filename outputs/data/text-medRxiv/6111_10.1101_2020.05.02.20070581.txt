To The Editor
Since the onset of the COVID-19 infection, many patients reported sudden loss of smell
(SLS). However, due to the lack of psychophysical testings, it remains difficult to know if
these patients really have hyposmia or anosmia. Our group investigated the prevalence of
anosmia and hyposmia in 28 COVID-19 patients and the potential association with nasal
complaints.

Methods:
Adults with SLS and mild-to-moderate COVID-19 manifestation were recruited after a public
call of the University of Mons (Belgium). The disease was confirmed through nasopharyngeal
swab (RT-PCR). Patients with neurological disorder, chronic rhinosinusitis or history of nasal
surgery were excluded. The patient epidemiological characteristics and the otolaryngological
symptoms were electronically collected through an online questionnaire (Professional Survey
Monkey®, San Mateo, California, USA). The nasosinusal symptoms were electronically
evaluated through the French sino-nasal outcome test-22 (SNOT-22).2
The olfactory and gustatory questions were based on the smell and taste component of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.3 The questions were chosen to
characterize the variation, timing and associated-symptoms of olfactory and gustatory
dysfunctions. The impact of olfactory dysfunction on quality of life of patients was evaluated
with the short version of Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQODNS).3
Patients benefited from psychophysical olfactory evaluation through sniffin stick tests
(Medisense, Groningen, Netherlands): 16 pens were presented to patients every 30 seconds.
The patient has to choose the adequate term describing the smell between 4 given options.

The test was scored on a total of 16 points and allowed categorization into in 3 groups:
normosmia (score between 12-16), hyposmia (score between 9-11) and anosmia (score <9).
The relationship between clinical and olfactory outcomes was analyzed through multiple
linear regression (SPSS, v22,0; IBM-Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).

Results:
28 patients completed the study (19 females). At the time of the evaluation, the mean duration
of olfactory disorders was 10.8±3.8 days (Table 1). The most common otolaryngological
symptoms were rhinorrhea, postnasal drip and nasal obstruction. Aroma disorder and
dysgeusia, which was defined as the impairment of the following taste modalities: salty,
sweet, bitter and sour, accounted for 85.7% and 60.1% of cases. Cacosmia and phantosmia
occurred in 46.4% and 25% of patients, respectively.
The psychophysical olfactory evaluations reported that 53.6% and 21.4% of SLS patients
were anosmic and hyposmic, respectively; 28.6% being normosmic (N=8). Among the 15
anosmic patients, 7 (46.7%) did not report nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea or postnasal drip
during the disease clinical course. Among the 6 hyposmic patients, only one did not report
these complaints. There were no significant differences between groups about the SLS mean
duration.
Patients with stronger sniffin test results had stronger sQOD-NS score (p=0.036). Anosmic
patients more frequently reported dyspnea, gustatory disorder and face pain (p<0.020). There
was no significant association between the results of the sniffin tests, the SNOT-22 items/total
score and the following complaints: nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip.

Discussion:

The olfactory disorder seems to be a key symptom of mild-to-moderate European and
American COVID-19 patients, accounting for more than 70% of patients.1,4 However, our
preliminary results suggested that only 53.6% of patients who claimed that they have SLS
really have anosmia regarding psychophysical tests. Regarding to this mismatch, the
prevalence of olfactory dysfunction related to COVID-19 would be overestimated in the
epidemiological studies based on patient-reported outcome questionnaires.
The majority of anosmic had no nasal complaints, which are usually associated with viral
infection, nasal mucosa inflammation and related-SLS. These data may support the
complexity of the mechanisms underlying the development of SLS in COVID-19. As
supported by basic science researches, SLS would be related to neural spread of the virus
through the olfactory cleft mucosa, affecting the olfactory neurons or glial cells.5 The
neurotropism of some coronavirus strains had previously been demonstated.6 Future studies
are needed to confirm the data of the current paper.
