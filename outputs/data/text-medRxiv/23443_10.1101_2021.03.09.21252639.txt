weaker health systems and underdeveloped economy. The risk of viral transmission in
HD center is elevated because of the densely-populated and high mobility in an

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an evolving
public health crisis and challenged the medical system globally, especially in
poverty-stricken region (1). The susceptibility of COVID-19 infection in hemodialysis
(HD) patients is increased because that they are of older age and have other health
issues including decreased immune function, diabetes, hypertension lung diseases and
so on. As the COVID-19 is insidious and highly infectious, it is prone to cause cluster
transmission. There is increased risk of viral transmission in HD center as a
densely-populated, high mobility and enclosed environment. There was a COVID-19
outbreak occurred in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University (2).
This study demonstrated the experiences and strategies of preventing secondary
COVID-19 transmission in a HD center from a poverty-stricken rural region in China.
Methods
Data of subjects including 17 medical workers and 249 patients were collected
from the HD center in Huangchuan County People's Hospital from February to April
2020. The study was approved by the local institutional review board, and informed
consents were obtained from all participants.
All subjects underwent chest computed tomographic (CT) scans and
hematological examination for screening. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SAR-CoV-2 detection were performed using
nasopharyngeal swabs for suspected cases.

The HD center had actively screened all patients for potential exposure to
confirmed/suspected COVID-19 case daily according to the information from local
Center for Disease Control and Prevention. On day 1, patient 1 was found that lives in
the same village with the new confirmed case on that day and closely contacted with
the people who was exposed to the confirmed case. Patient 1 had mild cough, no
elevated temperature, no sore throat or gastrointestinal symptom, and was informed
for chest CT and hematological examination. On day 2, patient 1 was diagnosed as a
suspected case according to the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline
(modified 5th version) (3) and admitted to the isolation ward. This patient had RT-PCR
test result positive for COVID-19 within 1 day. Patient 1 had negative RT-PCR test
results and relieved symptoms after treatment, and then was observed and received
HD in isolation ward for another 14 days.
Patient 2 through 4 were suspected cases and admitted to the isolation ward for
HD for 14 days. The RT-PCR tests were negative. On day 2, patients in adjacent beds
of patient 1 within the past 14 days were actively screened. On day 3, patients 2 and 3
were diagnosed as suspected cases. From day 4 to day 7, all of the HD patients,
medical workers, accompanying family members and cleaners were then screened,
and patient 4 was diagnosed as suspected case.
On day 2, all of the staff in the HD center were screened and isolated from their
families in a hotel for 2 weeks. Their daily work continues normally.
The characteristics of the study cohort were summarized in Table 1.The main
preventive experience and strategies of HD center during the COVID-19 epidemic are

shown in table 2. It has been reported that there was no secondary COVID-19
transmission in HD center.
Discussion
As a poverty-stricken rural region, the per capita disposable income in the
reported area was 1,962 USD (4). The described HD center is the only HD center in
this area. Even though the education level in medical workers and HD patients is low,
the active screening in HD center from this hospital prevented the secondary
COVID-19 transmission. Similarly, during the 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in Korea,
although 116 patients were exposed to MERS-CoV in HD units, but strict patient
surveillance and appropriate isolation measures prevented secondary transmissions (5).
In poverty-stricken rural region, the lack of protective awareness in asymptomatic
carriers or patients with mild symptoms due to the low education level might lead to
the further spread of coronavirus which can cause overwhelmed local medical system.
Therefore, the implementation of active screening and identification of COVID-19
confirmed/suspected case in HD center is important in poverty-stricken rural regions.
This study was limited as a single-centered study with small sample size. Future
multi-centered studies are needed for establish strategies for preventing secondary
transmission in HD center from poverty-stricken rural region.
