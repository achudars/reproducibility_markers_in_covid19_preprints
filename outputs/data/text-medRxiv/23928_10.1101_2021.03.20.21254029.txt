Abstract
2

With the aim of analyzing the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 pandemic on society in
general and health care workers in particular, we developed a 74-question survey

4

questionnaire which was shared through social media. After analyzing 56,656 responses
obtained during the first pandemic peak, the results showed an early and important

6

negative impact on family finances, fear of working with Covid-19 patients and ethical
issues related to Covid-19 care among healthcare workers (HCW). We have identified 7

8

target groups at higher risk of impaired mental health and susceptible to benefiting from
an intervention: women, under 42 years of age, people with care burden, socio-

10

economically deprived groups, people with unskilled or unqualified jobs, Covid-19
patients, and HCW working with Covid-19 patients. These results should encourage the

12

active implementation of specific strategies to increase resilience in these groups and to
prepare an adequate organizational response.

1. Introduction
2

On 30 March 2020, 78,797 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, 6,528 deaths and 14,709
patients who had recovered were reported in Spain [1]; 16,157 cases and 1,410 deaths

4

were recorded in Catalonia [2]. Case fatality (8%) was calculated for the registered cases,
although the mortality rate was uncertain and the total number of cases (including those

6

undiagnosed and with mild symptoms) were unknown. At that time, there was local
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Everyone with a compatible respiratory

8

condition was considered likely to be a case of SARS-CoV-2 although the etiological
diagnosis could not be made for all suspected cases in the context of a health emergency

10

because of the lack of kits and the saturation of the health system [3,4].
Other major outbreaks of infectious diseases such as Ebola have demonstrated that there

12

is an important impact on individuals and communities. The psychological effects of the
disease itself as well as the traumatic experiences of loved ones are seen at individual

14

level. At community level, health services, social systems and economic productivity are
severely affected [5].

16

Two months after the first case reported in Spain and 2.5 weeks into the quarantine
and self-isolation of the region of Catalonia, the emotional burden of the general

18

community had increased. An important impact on mental health and emotional burden
by SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and mass quarantines which have been implemented in other

20

epidemics context has been reported [6–9]. Moreover, because a certain level of anxiety
is necessary for the adoption of recommended precautionary measures against infection

22

outbreaks [10], and for the successful implementation of public health interventions, a
better understanding of people’s attitudes and the assessment of psychological impact on

24

them should be mandatory.

On the other hand, 2,600 (16%) of the confirmed cases in our setting by March 30th 2020
2

affected healthcare workers (HCW). Besides their obvious increased risk of being
infected, the HCW facing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics on the frontline (emergency

4

rooms, ICUs, and other depts.) were put under high levels of stress and anxiety. This
worsened as the tension in the Health Systems increased, requiring them to face important

6

ethical dilemmas including triage of patients. Additionally, the SARS epidemic proved
that frontline healthcare workers not only suffered from chronic stress at the time, but that

8

this lasted for at least one year after the epidemic wave was over [11].
In the face of all this, we decided to evaluate the impact of the first wave of the Covid-19

10

pandemic on both the general population and HCW, specifically on their socio-economic
status and their psychological distress.

2. M&M
2.1.Ethics

14

The study was reviewed and approved by the corresponding Ethics Committee, the
Comitè Ètic de l’Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol; and conformed to the

16

principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethical clearance was obtained
before starting the project. The survey was created and shared complying with the

18

European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and all data was processed
anonymously. The project is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier

20

NCT04378452.
2.2.Study procedures

22

An anonymous online survey was created with the Typeform software (Typeform SL,
Barcelona, Spain). It included 74 questions on demographic data (12 questions), socio-

24

economic sphere (8 questions), habits and health status related to Covid-19 during
confinement (13 questions) and mental health dimension (through questions related to

depression, anxiety, stress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder [PTSD] symptoms [41
2

questions]) (Supplementary Table 1). The survey was shared in 5 different languages
(Catalan, Spanish, English, Italian, and French) through social media using snowball

4

sampling. The data were downloaded as a spreadsheet file (Excel Microsoft Office) after
collection and deleted from the Typeform software.

6

2.3.Analysis and Statistics
Since there were no specific criteria for age stratification or the population density

8

(inhabitants / km2) of the municipality where the respondents lived that was significant
for all questions, it was decided to divide these categories in the cohort into groups

10

containing a similar sample size. Thus, and taking into account the volume of responses
obtained, age ranges have been determined statistically so that they are homogeneous in

12

terms of number of surveys completed by group.
The questions were grouped into indexes (socioeconomic precariousness index,

14

depression index, anxiety index, stress index, or PTSD). The scores of the socio-economic
precariousness index and population density by the respondents were segmented into 4

16

groups each. The criteria for segmentation were established in order to obtain balanced
groups in terms of the number of respondents in each category.

18

We determined 4 ranges of age: <42 years old, 42-52, 52-61 and >61 y.o. The 4 score
ranges of the 0-19 scale of socio-economic precariousness established were: low

20

precariousness ≤7 points, mid-low=7-8.5, mid-high=8.5-10 and high >10 points.
All results were obtained taking into account the fact that the respondents were part of

22

the totality of the cohort of respondents. Responses were also analyzed in total by
category and broken down into percentages according to conditional distributions taking

24

into account; on the one hand the gender of the respondents, and on the other their age
group.

We took the non-binary gender and those who preferred not to say which gender they
2

identify as into account when analyzing the results, as this enriches the conclusions.
However, statistical analysis, often does not take into account the minimum volumes of

4

responses and therefore only the groups of women and men were compared.
Response percentages were calculated based on the number of respondents for each

6

answer out of the total number of responses to each question. To assess whether the
categorical variables were significantly related or not, we applied the Chi-Square test

8

independently in the observed counts. We conducted a bivariate analysis between scores
and sociodemographic variables. Differences in score distribution between different

10

groups were assessed by comparing probability distributions using a two-band Wilcoxonsigned rank test and collecting the p-value using Matlab's 'signrank' function [12,13].

12

All tests were applied bilaterally using a significance of 5% (p <0.05).

3.1. Characteristics of the cohort
We analyzed 56,656 questionnaires. The characteristics of the cohort are described in

18

Table 1. Differences between categories by gender and age are described in
Supplementary Table 2. The majority of respondents were females (70.4%), and from

20

Catalonia. Those living most precariously were under 42 years old, with 18.43% sharing
an apartment/house. (p<0.01). Most respondents had a degree (42.62%), and a qualified

22

job (36.13%). 9% of total respondents worked in the healthcare sector. Most unemployed
people were in the younger age range (7.6%) and in the non-binary/those who preferred

24

not to say groups (approximately 12% each).

Up to 60% of the total declared that they were taking care of someone: 24.81% caring for
2

children of <16 years and 15.11% caring for parents. Women were caregivers more
frequently than men (p<0.01). The burden of care was also higher for women and people

4

of 42-61 years old (p<0.01) and concerningly high for 4.79% of total respondents.
3.2. Impact of the pandemic on the General population

6

The impact on general population according to the responses obtained to the questionnaire
is described in Table 2. Categories of responses by gender and group are described in

8

Supplementary Table 2. 85.32% of the cohort declared they were remaining at home.
Those working in essential services were mostly women or of non-binary gender, and the

10

percentage of women was also higher amongst those who were obliged to go to work onsite (p<0.01).

12

Only 2 weeks after starting the lock-down, 25% of the cohort had already lost their job
or work. People under 52, as opposed to people over 52, and men, as opposed to women,

14

were the most affected (p<0.01). 20.67% of the respondents declared that they had no
savings at all (Table 1). After the start of measures announced by the authorities to cope

16

with the pandemic, 82.75% of respondents declared that they were being careful or had
decreased their expenses. Up to 8.78% of respondents declared that they had used social

18

services help or that would need to use it soon. Those under 52 and people identifying as
non-binary gender or preferring not to say were the most affected (p<0.01 and p<0.05,

20

respectively). Those under 42 years, followed by people over 61 and people identifying
as non-binary gender were the ones who showed higher precariousness index values

22

(p<0.01).
The 19.84% of respondents declared that they had had contact with someone infected by

24

SARS-CoV-2, half of them with a confirmed or probable case and this was more frequent
for women under 52 (p<0.01). 35.75% declared that during the previous 14 days they had

used at least one existing healthcare resource or one put in place by the authorities in the
2

context of the pandemic, and 64.25%, had used none. 73.82% declared to have had one
or more symptoms compatible with Covid-19. The most frequent symptoms were

4

headache (16.01%), sore throat and nasal congestion (9.85% and 9.17% respectively).
Only 1.76% of people with one symptom or more had received a PCR test and only 1.81%

6

of those declaring three symptoms or more. Women and under 42 said that they felt worse
at the moment they answered the survey than people in other groups (p<0.01).

8

The 42.05% of respondents said they had increased their consumption habits: in most
cases of food. Women under 42 showed the largest increase in consumption, except for

10

illegal drugs, compared with other groups (p<0.01).
Most people said TV was their source of information on the pandemic (36.77%), followed

12

by social media (29.23%). 30% of people only used one source, 37.84% 2 sources and
23.05% used 3. There was no difference across gender or age groups. 26.82% declared

14

that the information given did not accurately reflect reality (more frequent in women and
people over 52 (p<0.01), and another 20.92% said that it was too negative or too

16

sensationalist (more frequent in men and people under 42 (p<0.01). 73.13% declared that
they were afraid or worried, these including more women, but a lower percentage of

18

people over 61 (p<0.01).
The 78.56% of the cohort declared that the pandemic had changed them, most of them

20

(50,41%) in the way that they see society/how we used to live. Those most affected were
women (more than men) and those under 42 vs the >61 (p<0.01 in both cases).

22

3.3. Impact of pandemic on HCW
A total of 5,104 people (9.05% of the total) identified themselves as workers in the

24

healthcare sector, most of them women. While the proportion women/men in the total
cohort is 70/30 in this subgroup the proportion is 85/15. The impact on this population is

detailed in Table 3. 41.65% of healthcare personnel declared that they had worked
2

directly with Covid-19 patients, 32% of them while on duty. The majority of healthcare
workers said that they were afraid to work with Covid-19 patients (75.87%). As it was a

4

multiple-choice question, we know that around the 42.90% were afraid of transmitting
the infection to their relatives/friends, 17.07% feared getting infected or transmitting it to

6

other patients, and 4.28% were afraid of dying. Surprisingly, fear of dying decreased with
age. In all cases it was higher percentages of younger HCW who said they were afraid

8

(p<0.01).
More than 6 percent of healthcare workers (6.27%) were worried of taking medical

10

decisions that represented an ethical problem for them. In fact, nearly 18.60% of them
said that they had ethical problems/dilemmas/issues while working. Of these, the younger

12

the respondents, the higher the percentage, especially with the patient triage and
obligatory protocols (p<0.01). As many as 437 of 5,104 healthcare workers decided to

14

explain to us which ethical problems they had had. We have grouped the problems and
issues that the professionals listed, and the results are found in Table 3.

16

3.4. Impact of the pandemic on mental health status
Table 4 summarizes the conditions found statistically significantly associated (p<0.05)

18

with the mental health symptoms evaluated. According to this table, we have identified 7
target groups susceptible to benefitting from an intervention, and which should be taken

20

into account when designing new contention measures to cope with the pandemic: 1)
women; 2) people under 42; 3) caregivers ; 4) people working in essential services or

22

non-qualified jobs; 5) people with a higher precariousness index; 6) Covid-19 patients
and 7) healthcare personnel, especially those working with Covid-19 patients.

4. Discussion
2

Researchers have already sounded the alarm about how the Covid-19 pandemic may
affect the mental health of the general population, and more specifically patients with

4

previous physical or mental conditions (including previous mental disorders) [14,15] and
people at risk due to their socio-economic conditions. The current study aimed to identify

6

the impacts of the covid-19 pandemia at several levels using a questionnaire.
Our survey was disseminated through social media, thus the sample of population studied

8

could not be controlled. However, this was a successful strategy to rapidly reach a large
number of people in different settings and different regions, without exposing

10

interviewers to infection. Even though this does not ensure representability, there is no
other study that has reached such a huge number of subjects, as more than 50,000

12

completed questionnaires were obtained from geographical regions hit by the pandemic
in different ways.

14

The criteria used to establish the age ranges, the population density and the
socioeconomic precariousness index were statistical, in order to obtain balanced groups

16

in terms of number of responses. This provides rigor but can be confusing because this
segmentation is unusual and can lead to a certain bias.

18

As for the impact on the socioeconomic sphere, the highest level of precariousness, which
according to what the results seem to reflect occurs in those under 42 years of age, is

20

striking. Of particular concern is the fact that 25% of the people who responded to the
survey in our study had decreased their workload due to the epidemic situation. According

22

to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the reduction in employment is greater
among women and younger and older people, who have all been particularly affected by

24

the Covid-19 crisis. In our study, men are the ones who had lost more jobs or assignments
previously contracted or hired, and we saw that higher percentages of those under 52

years old had been dismissed or submitted to a temporary labour force adjustment.
2

Overall, global labour incomes have been estimated to have fallen by 10.7% during the
first three quarters of 2020 (compared to the same period in 2019) [16], but we believe

4

this could be much worse given our results. In addition, in our study, a quarter of
respondents had no savings to deal with contingencies, and up to 8.78% stated that they

6

had applied for social benefits or that they would do so soon. All of this is important
because as we have demonstrated in our results, socioeconomic precariousness was

8

revealed to be one of the factors associated with higher scores on mental health indices,
and this is even more worrying given that the incidence of the epidemic was also more

10

pronounced in the poorest neighborhoods, at least in Barcelona [17]. We would also like
to mention that more studies should be carried out to analyze the socio-economic

12

precariousness of the group of non-binary people, as we have seen trends that have not
been statistically evident but would be worth confirming.

14

According to the literature, approximately 20% of the population affected seems
consistent [7,18,19], even if in some cases higher percentages have been found [20,21].

16

According to our results, we have identified up to 7 target groups at higher risk of
impaired mental health status and susceptible to benefitting from an intervention, and

18

which should be taken into account when designing new contention measures against the
pandemic. In our study we did found an association of worse symptoms scoring with the

20

presence of symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or having used all the healthcare
resources put in place. However, as a real intervention based on these assumptions would

22

be very costly and logistically difficult, we do consider instead that the target group for
an intervention should be confirmed Covid-19 patients.

24

Other studies have also shown that being female, young, and having unstable work or
income to be significant correlators of psychological negative impact [20–23]. Women

are especially vulnerable as they bear the heavier burden of childcare and care of the
2

elderly, suffer gender violence and have more precarious jobs. This effect, which is
generalized in society, is even more obvious if the female sex is combined with

4

characteristics of vulnerable groups [24]. Sex and gender biases have been identified as
linked to Covid-19 outbreaks. In many settings, women appear to be slightly more likely

6

to be diagnosed with Covid-19, which may in part be due to the fact that women account
for the majority of health care workers around the world. Moreover, several studies have

8

highlighted that fact that health staff who are women, younger or parents of dependent
children are more vulnerable to psychological distress [25]. We also know that crises

10

exacerbate gender inequalities: gender-based violence increased during confinement
[26]; women were doing 3-10 times more care work than men; women faced significant

12

barriers to healthcare due to lack of autonomy over their own sexual and reproductive
health, inadequate access to health services, and insufficient financial resources [27]. In

14

this sense, it is anticipated that the Covid-19 crisis will trigger an economic recession
which will disproportionately impact the income and employment of the most vulnerable,

16

particularly women [28]. In our setting it was mostly women who were responsible for
caring for others. Caregiver adults with higher perception of the difficulty of quarantine

18

for children and the whole family suffered more psychological distress than the other
groups. This was previously identified in a cohort of parents in Italy, showing that their

20

individual perception was associated with their stress levels and a negative behavioural
and emotional impact on their children. As this study points out, some of the causes for

22

this could be the impact of the situation itself both on the adults and the children, plus the
effects of the school closure together with the need for working from home with a lot of

24

new inputs. It not only has a negative effect on the adults, but on the children both
indirectly [29] and directly [30]. Schools provide not only education, but also counselling

and promote and imply healthy habits (healthy diet, physical exercise, social interaction),
2

that might not be continued at home [30].
On the other hand, people over 60 years old were the vast majority of the total number of

4

deaths all over the world [31]. While their frailty and an increased risk of suffering Covid19 if living in nursing homes or similar facilities is true/undeniable, the elderly are key in

6

Mediterranean countries, such as ours, as they take care of grandchildren when their
parents go to work, so to quarantine and isolate them can be very disturbing for the whole

8

of society. Moreover, Covid-19 and the consequences of isolating the elderly can be
devastating, not only for their mental health but also as it contributes to a greater risk of

10

morbidity, and this can be even worse in the more disadvantaged populations [32,33]. In
this perspective, older people had more difficulties than younger people in adjusting to

12

lockdown and social distancing rules. On the other hand, older people have proved that
they have more resilience than younger people in other outbreaks and major hazards [34],

14

something that our results also support by showing that older people were less afraid of
dying than younger ones. All seniors showed anxiety and depression issues in China, and

16

results were worse for females [35]. A Spanish study reported that up to 25.6% of a
sample of adults with a mean age of 65 had symptoms of depression and 32.1% symptoms

18

of avoidant coping style, and that having a current or past history of mental disorders
highly influenced this, while the main protective factor was the ability to enjoy free time

20

[36]. However, we found that younger people coped worse than older people with the
mental burden due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the measures dictated to combat it.

22

Differences between younger and older adults in emotional responses and recovery have
been previously described, and several reasons for it have been hypothesized, including

24

the fact that the elderly have a higher sense of meaning of life and that for them perceiving
time as finite determines their priorities in terms of goals and behaviours [37]. In the

context of the Covid-19 outbreak’s first wave, others have reported an increased negative
2

impact on younger people compared with the elderly. A study in France after 2 weeks of
confinement reported sleep problems and increased consumption of sleeping pills, with

4

both more frequent in people under 35 compared to older people[38]. Young adults
already face life changes which are stressful and the pandemic has worsened this, even if

6

one out of five young adults might have been better off because of being removed from
external pressures such as work and education and/or to having more time for close

8

relationships [39]. A nice study in Switzerland concluded that for this specific population
the distress related to lifestyle disruptions and hopelessness was higher than the perceived

10

virus-related health risk [39], which others have already shown to be was relatively low
[40]. Shanahan et al also showed that a good group to be selected for intervention could

12

be females, migrants and young adults with higher pre-pandemic emotional distress
including social exclusion [39]. Another factor which has been related to distress is the

14

decrease of physical and social activity due to lockdown and other restriction measures
decreed by Governments, which had a negative impact on psychological wellbeing of

16

individuals including the elderly [41], but especially on the group of adolescents and
young adults [40,42].

18

A non-negligible proportion of our respondents were HCW, who in Europe are mostly
women [43]. Besides their obvious increased risk of being infected [44], facing the

20

SARS-CoV-2 epidemics at the frontline may have put them under a lot of pressure,
increasing levels of anxiety and chronic stress (as they faced tremendous overwork and

22

suboptimal working conditions), which can last to up to a year afterwards [11,45,46].
A study carried out in a cohort of 9,138 HCW showed that 45.7% were at risk of suffering

24

from a mental disorder [47], and another, which included 5,450, showed that 8.4% had
suicidal ideation and behaviour [48]. In our study, being a HCW has been revealed as a

15

positive factor for impaired mental health, especially for those working with Covid-19
2

patients and afraid of infecting others, which has proved to have an impact on outcomes
[49].

4

This becomes worse as the tension in health systems increases, as front-line professionals
work in a complex environment given the ethical challenges of the Covid-19, eliciting

6

different dimensions of ethical dilemmas related to the situation itself and the measures
dictated by the Government [50]. The shortage of hospital beds — and especially ICU

8

beds — was also an important problem, contributing to the case fatality rate and implying
a triage of patients in order to preserve the beds for those with an increased potential to

10

survive [51–53]. The management of end-of-life situations was particularly worrying, as
banning the support of relatives at the bedside had a very disturbing impact on patients

12

and their families, but also on HCW mental health, workload, challenges and professional
outcomes [54]. According to our results, nearly 8 out of 10 HCW declared that they were

14

afraid of working with COVID patients, especially because of infecting others. Being
obliged to work with lack of appropriate or sufficient personal protective equipment was

16

one of the most frequent complaints of HCW who shared their narratives on the ethical
concerns they suffered. This low sense of security had been previously pointed out in a

18

small HCW cohort in Spain [55], in nurses in Poland [56] and in Latin America [57]. We
found differences between women and men in terms of the fear of transmitting the

20

infection to others, and this could be related to women’s jobs implying more exposure (as
is the case for nurses, that in our cohort were mostly women). In our study those working

22

in essential services also had higher psychological distress and this could be for the same
reason, the low sense of security, plus the fear of being at higher risk of contracting the

24

infection.

The 6.27% declared that that their fear was of making medical decisions that represented
2

an ethical problem for them (patient selection or application of protocols), and this
percentage was higher in younger people.

4

In fact, in our sample, one in five of the HCW declared that they had had ethical problems
during those first weeks of the peak of the first wave, which is in line with other studies

6

[54,58]; and approximately half of these had to do with patient selection or patient triage
protocols/therapeutic indications. In our opinion, this fact should also be explored more

8

thoroughly and actively followed up to prevent health professionals from being put into
similar situations in the future.

5. Conclusion
12

Our study represents a photograph of the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the general
wellbeing of the population and HCW, which should open the door for the elaboration of

14

strategy proposals with the full participation of institutional leaders who are in a position
to adapt policy to the real needs of the people. Previous work in smaller, selected cohorts

16

(seniors, youth, etc.) has described the significant impact of the pandemic in a number of
areas, including mental health problems in 20% of the population. In this project we have

18

studied 56,656 completed surveys and analyzed the effects of Covid-19 on family
finances, habits and attitudes, general health and mental health, and the day to day of

20

health professionals. We were able to confirm the results noted by other smaller studies
and to identify up to seven populations likely to benefit from an intervention: women;

22

those under 42 years old; caregivers; people in a situation of socio-economic
precariousness; essential workers or those with unskilled jobs; Covid-19 patients, and

24

HCW, especially those working with COVID-patients. This data should be used to design
and implement interventions to increase the resilience of these identified groups, as well

as to prepare an appropriate organizational response. In this sense, some authors have
2

published specific strategies that could be used to alleviate this suffering, especially in
terms of increasing the adaptability of caregivers by providing tools for recognizing risk

4

factors for emotional distress and managing mental health hygiene, but also response
actions by public and private organizations aimed at identifying the employees most at-

6

risk and establishing active mitigating and corrective measures [52,54,59–62]. We think
it would be worthwhile studying how to actively implement and adapt these measures to

8

our environment, not only in the health field but also by extending them to the groups we
have identified. The results obtained could help local and national Governments and

10

Public Health Services to design or adjust coping measures in the face of potential future
outbreaks or other major hazards that might be difficult for society.
