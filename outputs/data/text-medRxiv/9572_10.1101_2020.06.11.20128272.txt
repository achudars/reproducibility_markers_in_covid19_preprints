Abstract
Evidence that face masks provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the
community is scarce. However, face masks are widely used by health workers as part of
droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would therefore
be reasonable to suggest that consistent widespread use of face masks in the community
could prevent further spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2). In this study we examine public face mask wearing in Uganda where a proportion
wears masks to protect against acquiring, and the other to prevent from transmitting SARSCoV-2. The objective of this study was to determine what percentage of the population would
have to wear face masks to reduce susceptibility to and infectivity of SARS-COV-2 in Uganda,
keeping the basic reproduction number below unity and/or flattening the curve. We used an
SEIAQRD model for the analysis. Results show that implementation of facemasks has a
relatively large impact on the size of the coronavirus epidemic in Uganda. We find that the
critical mask adherence is 5 per 100 when 80% wear face masks. A cost-effective analysis
shows that utilizing funds to provide 1 public mask to the population has a per capita
compounded cost of USD 1.34. If provision of face masks is done simultaneously with
supportive care, the per capita compounded cost is USD 1.965, while for the case of only
treatment and no provision of face masks costs each Ugandan USD 4.0579. We conclude that
since it is hard to achieve a 100% adherence to face masks, government might consider
provision of face masks in conjunction with provision of care.

On 30 January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern. The WHO officially named this infectious disease coronavirus disease 2019 (SARSCOV-2) on 12 February 2020. Later, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) officially designated the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice. As of June, 06 2020,
6,612,301 confirmed cases had been reported with 391,161 deaths across 213 countries and
territories (WHO, Rolling updates on coronavirus disease (SARS-COV-2)).
SARS-CoV-2 is a new disease and the world is still learning about how it spreads. In general,
respiratory virus infection can occur through contact (direct or indirect), droplet spray in short
range transmission, or aerosol in long-range transmission (airborne transmission). With no
supply of antivirals and vaccines (WHO, Coronavirus disease (SARS-COV-2) pandemic),
countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic SARSCoV-2, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. One of
the preventions and controls for further spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the use of facemask, within
the context of other public health interventions such as regular handwashing/sanitization,
and social distancing (Chu et. al., 2020; Crowling et. al., 2020; Barasheed et. al., 2020; Lau et.
al., 2020; Suess et. al., 2020; Ngonghala et. al., 2020). More recent studies have since added
additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks (Wang et. al., 2020), and that
their use would serve as an adjunctive preventive method regarding the SARS-COV-2
outbreak (Liang, Mingming et al., 2020). Masks were previously not generally recommended
for the public because they can be contaminated by other people's coughs and sneezes, or
when putting them on or removing them (Kwon 2017). They may also offer a false sense of
security, although they are beneficial as covers of the mouths of people already infected
(WHO, Advice on the use of masks in the context of SARS-COV-2). The WHO currently
recommends medical-grade mask for people over 60 years when they are out and cannot
socially distance, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask (WHO - Coronavirus
disease, 2020: Advice for the public: Myth busters). People without symptoms transmit the
coronavirus without knowing they are infected (Byambasuren et. al., 2020; Wei et. al., 2020;
Cheng et. al., 2020). As in prior respiratory infections (Sim, Moey, and Tan, 2014), absence of
any documented community cases in Uganda appears to have led some people to perceive
themselves to not be susceptible and the absence of any SARS-COV-2 related death may be
perceived as a less severe infection. Recent research has shown that people are willing to
wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection and further transmission for those
already infected (Chu et. al., 2020). There is therefore need to quantify the effect and cost
effectiveness of using facemasks in reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Uganda has adopted the use of face masks among the key interventions for prevention of the
spread of SARS-COV-2, and the Government has supported expansion of local manufacturing
of masks with a plan to distribute at least one free mask to all Ugandans aged 6 years and
older. However, there were mixed reactions from the public with concerns about the
mandatory use as well as cost of the masks. Adhering to public mask use might feel as a
forfeiture of one’s freedom due to the discomfort (Scottie Andrew, CNN), while others view
it as a sign of fear, weakness or vulnerability. On the other hand, initial public health
recommendations did not encourage use of masks in public except for the infected individuals
(WHO, 2020). These mixed messages and uncertainty of the effectiveness of masks in public,
may affect compliance with use of masks. Masks are not physically comfortable (Jefferson et.

al., 2020; Matusiak et. al, 2020), and this may be enough to steer some people away from
them. The aim of this study is to therefore determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of
facemasks in reducing susceptibility to and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We also seek to
determine what percentage of the population would have to wear this gear in order to reduce
the number of coronavirus infections within the community.

Methodology
To estimate/forecast the population level impact and cost-effectiveness of public face masks,
we design an SEIAQRD mathematical model for a population where a proportion of the
general population wears face masks for primary protection against acquiring SARS-CoV-2,
while the other wears masks to prevent against transmitting disease. As in other infectious
diseases, we model SARS-CoV-2 using a conceptual model indicating how individuals move
from the Susceptible state (at risk state) S, to the pre-symptomatic (those who have been
exposed E), the Infectious (those who display symptoms after the incubation period I), the
Asymptomatic (infected but not displaying symptoms A), the institutional Quarantined Q(
traced contacts of the confirmed positives), the recovered (R) and the Dead (D). The SEIAQRD
is parameterized using SARS-CoV-2 data from Uganda to estimate the parameters for its
transmission. We assumed 30 initial exposures where 20 are from boarder points and 10
health workers. The transmission rate is obtained by considering the probability of infection
multiplied by the estimated number of contacts. To move from one state to another, we
estimate the probability of transition using the duration an individual spends in a particular
compartment until they are either recovered or dead.
The model attempts to determine, if facemasks are effective in reducing susceptibility to and
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the percentage of the population that would have to wear this gear
to reduce the number of coronavirus infections within the community. The analysis and
figures are generated using WHO guidelines of 3.7% exposure, 10% development of
symptoms, and the 80:8:8:3:1 ratio of asymptomaticity, mild, moderate, severe and critical.
Initial population used is 100,000 and the number of contacts for each confirmed individual
is 20. It is assumed that quarantining of contacts ends after 14 days, while isolation or viral
clearance takes an average of 21 days for the asymptomatic, mild and moderate, 28 days for
severe, and 35 for critical. We explored the effect of adherence to use of masks on viral
reproduction, and the effect of early detection to community spread. The model was rerun
with varying detection rates, when facemask adherence in both cases is 60%.
We also hypothesize that masks can reduce exposure and perform a cost-utility analysis to
examine whether they are cost effective as compared to quarantining and/or treatment of
symptoms. Two scenarios were considered: first, assuming that the entire population
received and wore masks, we determine how much it would cost the country in comparison
to the cases averted. Secondly, how many cases would be averted if the funds were invested
in other mitigation measures, or in treatment? We explore this using an initial number of 30
exposed individuals in the community, 20 at boarder points and 10 health workers.
A simple model with the transit states and relative costs for each transition was used. We
compare the costs for one mask to the unit costs for detection, contact tracing, quarantine,
treatment including beds and ventilators. We also compare the cases averted for each
intervention, and the quality adjusted life years. The stages of an infected individual are

modeled with a low mask coverage, the implementation of facemasks still has a relatively
large impact on the size of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. However, the greatest reduction is
observed when a high percentage wears facemask. In this case, the replication number is
reduced to below unity and the virus is suppressed.

In this case, face masking is
effective in lowering the
replication number to below
unity, thereby delaying the
spread of the virus in the
short run. When face masks
are worn to protect against
acquiring the virus, the
replication number reduces
but not below 1 and the curve
is not flattened (Figure 5). In

and

We further observe a reduced number of

For example, when face mask
coverage is between 80-100%, there
is a 91% reduction in SARS-CoV-2
exposure and the curve is flattened
after 220 days. In both scenarios,
compliance and adherence must be
ensured. We explored the effect of
adherence to use of masks on viral
reproduction.
We find that
adherence to public facemasks as a
mitigation measure reduces the
replacement number to below unity,
thereby controlling further spread of SARS-CoV2 (Figure 7). We observe that when individuals
adhere to face masking, it provides a faster
reduction in replacement number.

We also point out that the mask used should
comply with the WHO guidelines of medicalgrade masks (WHO, Information on

Although public face masking has been shown to be effective in controlling further spread of
SARS-CoV-2, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy in Uganda is unknown. Next we determine
the cost-effectiveness of facemasks in Uganda using the transit states model in Figure 9, with
inputs from the Ministry of Health.

In this case we assume 30% adherence to facemasks. The total population used is 40 million,
and of this, only 12,000,000 wear masks. Thus, 28,000,000 are at risk of exposure. Therefore,
the number of individuals who are at risk of exposure is 3.7% of 28 million which is 1,036,000.
As per WHO, only of 10% of exposures result in successful infection. Therefore, The total
number of individuals who eventually get SARS-COV-2 infection is 103,600. The third

Discussion
In this study, we look at the efficacy of face masks as a mitigation measure against SARSCoV-2. A mathematical model was used to determine the impact and cost effectiveness of
face masks to reduce susceptibility or as a source control and prevention of transmission. Our
results show that when a proper mask is used correctly, there is reduction in exposure, and a
delay in the spread of the virus within the community. It also flattens the curve and provides
time to expand the healthcare capacity. We caution here that these results are achievable
when a proper mask is used efficiently. Any mask is only as efficient as the way it is used,
fitted, worn and discarded. The reason it can cause more spreading of the virus is because

people don’t fit their masks properly and continue touching the outer contaminated surface
to adjust it, without hand washing or sanitizing thereafter. Therefore, our results are
obtainable with continued public adherence to correct use of proper face masks. We also
note that other primary interventions, such as handwashing, sanitizing and social distance
“combination intervention”, are essential as public health approaches. Model simulations,
using data relevant to SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in Uganda suggest that broad adoption of face
masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease peak
hospitalizations and deaths. With these results, we caution that masks are efficient when
worn to protect against catching the virus, and for source control/protection against further
transmission.
Comparing the implementation costs of face masking, we find that simultaneous provision of
face masks and treatment is a more efficient and perhaps sustainable approach than
provision of face masks only, or provision of only treatment.
These results reinforce the current Uganda policy which integrates masks to suppress and
contain SARS-CoV-2. The scenario with dual purpose to protect and prevent further
transmission is more efficient and people should be made aware of this and encouraged to
wear masks.

Recommendations

This report provides an insight into the potential community-wide impact of widespread face
mask use by the general population. The mathematical model parameterized using Ugandan
data relevant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission suggests strong benefits of the general use of face
masks in public. From the study we recommend that facemasks
i.
should be nearly universal if supplies permit to ensure nation-wide compliance
ii.
should be adopted as early as possible for the best population-level benefit
iii.
be used concurrently with other interventions and viewed as a complement to
other public health non-pharmaceutical interventions and not as an alternative
use even when SARS-CoV-2 burden is low will pay dividends
iv.
are most efficient for source control, but valuable as both source control and
primary prevention
These are theoretical results and must be interpreted with caution, owing to a combination
of potentially high rates of noncompliance with mask use in the community, uncertainty with
respect to the intrinsic effectiveness of (especially homemade) masks at blocking respiratory
droplets and/or aerosols, and uncertainty regarding the basic mechanisms for respiratory
infection transmission. However, these results suggest a significant value even to low quality
masks when used widely in the community. Despite the uncertainty, the potential for benefit,
the lack of obvious harm, and
the precautionary principle, we strongly recommend facemask use nationwide, especially if
there is no diversion for healthcare supply.
