Abstract
Background. Knowing the true infected and symptomatic case fatality ratios (IFR and CFR) for
COVID-19 is of high importance for epidemiological model projections. A large correction
factor is usually applied for missed cases. For the United State reported CFR of 5.96%, the
estimated IFR values are 10-50-fold lower, justified by early reported CFR values of 0.1% to
0.5% in countries with more extensive testing. However, since then these values have risen 5 to
10-fold. We analyzed their age dependent CFR time courses to explain this increase and to
determine whether a common factor can explain their CFRs.
Methods. Age dependent time to fatality corrected CFR was calculated using two independent
methods. A linear model was developed that predicts CFR based on age dependent CFR
coefficients and the age distribution of cases. The model was tested by a linear regression of each
country’s CFR against case percentage of 70 years and over. The model was further tested by
calculating the percent of the population in New York City who have been infected.
Results. Corrected CFR values ranged from 0.58% to 5.0%. The large majority of CFR variation
was explained by case age distribution above 70 years old. Using the CFR derived from the
linear model we predicted between 14.7% and 22% of the adult population in NYC had been
infected by COVID-19, in agreement with random testing studies (15.3% - 21%).
Conclusions. The large rise in the reported CFR is due to the delay time between
infection/diagnosis and fatality with COVID-19. The linear model based on their age specific
CFR values provides an alternative method for calculating the true CFR in other regions. Most of
the variation in CFR between countries was dependent on case age distribution, which must be
considered in measures for mitigating the extensive impacts of the pandemic.

Introduction
Knowing the fraction of individuals infected with COVID-19 who will likely die or require
hospitalization is critical for epidemiological modeling and public health policy. Obtaining an
accurate estimate of the fatality ratio for all symptomatic cases (referred to as the case fatality
ratio, CFR) and infected cases (IFR) is complicated by mild and asymptomatic cases not being
detected, and by the time lag between diagnosis and fatality.(1) For COVID-19, the World
Health Organization (WHO) reported a non-corrected CFR (often referred to naïve CFR or
nCFR) of 3.5 +/- 0.2 % as of March 3, 2020.(2) Several reports have attempted to estimate the
true IFR and CFR from this data as well as from the data of other countries. As shown in Table
1, with one exception, the true CFR values for China were estimated to be between 0.85% and
1.4% which are all substantially lower than the reported Chinese nCFR value.(3–7) For the
United States and United Kingdom, even lower true CFR and IFR values have been reported
ranging from 0.125% to 0.9%.(3,5,8–11) Support for these lower values has been provided by
comparison with reported nCFR values of less than 1% early in the outbreak from countries that
were believed to have captured almost all of their symptomatic cases due to extensive testing and
tracing of contacts.(4,8,9,12) Another cited example is the Diamond Princess cruise ship, in
which all passengers were tested, for which early nCFR/IFR reports were in the 0.3% to 1.1%
range.(4,6,8,9)
To determine whether these countries continued to have a low nCFR later in their outbreaks, we
reexamined the reported number of fatalities and nCFR values outbreaks on May 7, 2020 for
Australia, Austria, Germany, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea. In all cases these
countries continued to have a high degree of testing and tracking and testing of contacts as
shown by their ratio of total tests to positive tests ranging from 16:1 to 127:1, versus 7:1 for the
United States and 8:1 for the United Kingdom, (Appendix 4). Therefore, their final reported
nCFR values, when all cases are complete, are potentially close to their true CFR value (if all
symptomatic cases were tested). To determine why there was a large increase in their reported
CFR over time we calculated for each country a CFR values corrected for the known time delay
between diagnosis (time of test) and fatality (corrected CFR) using two methods.(3) In the
standard approach, we used a probability distribution function (fD) for the estimated probability
of a fatality versus “days-after-diagnosis”.(1,3,6) We also independently estimated the corrected
CFR from the closed case CFR time course. The methods gave similar corrected CFR values for
each country (Table 2). Furthermore, our simulations showed that both methods provide accurate
CFR values even early in the outbreaks when the reported nCFR values were several fold lower.
As shown in Table 1, for the countries examined, despite early low reported nCFR values and
very high levels of testing (Appendix 4) we calculated a wide range of corrected CFR values from 0.6% to 5.0%. These values are well above the majority of CFR and IFR values estimated
for the United States and United Kingdom.(5,10,13,14) Despite this range, the large majority of
the variation between countries was explained by the fraction of each country’s cases in the age
ranges of 70 – 79 and 80 and above (Table 1, Figure 6). These age groups accounted on average
for over 80% of the reported fatalities. The finding of a strong correlation of the corrected CFR
with age also supports the hypothesis that the testing in each country was sufficient to capture the
majority of their symptomatic cases.

Using the corrected CFR for these groups and the population under 70, we developed a linear
model for predicting the CFR and IFR values for countries and regions with limited testing.
From this model we estimated the corrected CFR for China using the linear model from the case
age distribution data reported February 11, 2020 (WHO release) at 2.19% (95% CI of the mean:
1.54%-2.85%). As shown in Table 1, this value is higher than the majority of previous estimates
for China, but falls within their range when earlier values are multiplied by the 1.5 fold increase
in total number of fatalities recently reported by the Chinese government.(2)
Regarding US and UK populations, there is a much wider range of CFR and IFR estimates, with
the lowest values being almost 40 times below the highest CFR we calculated (Germany).(4,5,8–
11) We therefore tested our model by calculating the percent of the population who has been
infected with COVID-19 in New York City and comparing it to the results of recent random
testing studies. New York City was chosen because it is undergoing a large outbreak, and it is
likely, therefore, that the percentage of infected individuals is sufficiently high such that false
positives and negatives in antibody tests used would not have a large effect on the study’s
outcome.(15,16) We predicted as of April 22, 2020 the percentage of the adult population that
had been infected by COVID- was between 4.69% and 22.01%. These values are consistent with
the reported values of 15.3% and 21%.(16,17) In contrast, using previously reported IFR values
gave minimum estimates between 1.5 and 10-fold higher (see Figure 7).(5,8–11,15,16)

Calculations
Estimation of the corrected CFR based on correction of the reported nCFR(t) for the delay
between diagnosis and fatality and from the closed case CFR. We used two independent
methods to estimate the corrected CFR. In one method we corrected the reported nCFR(t) for the
time delay between diagnosis and fatality based on previously reported approaches.(3,5–
7,21,23,32,33) The second method was based on our observation that in all countries analyzed
the closed case CFR (see definitions) converged to a near constant value prior to the nCFR. A
closed case is defined as a case that has been designated as recovered or has died. Unlike the
nCFR, it is not impacted by changes in the percentage of the infected population that is tested
during the duration of the epidemic. As shown in Appendix 3, provided that the median times to

fatality and for recovery stay approximately constant during the outbreak, the closed case CFR
will converge to the final value prior to the nCFR.
We implemented a time-delay-to-fatality correction method using an fD derived from reported
log-normal fits of data obtained from China, between December and late January, of the
percentage of fatalities of COVID-19 patients per day after diagnosis.(1,3,5,6,33) Data was used
only from patients who were hospitalized outside of Hubei province to avoid the potential
problem that adequate medical care was likely not available within the province, and especially
in Wuhan, early in the outbreak.(3,7,21) For the cohort of cases diagnosed on day j, the fD at day
t is described by,
[1]

The calculated cumulative number of fatalities from the cohort diagnosed on day j on day t was
calculated from the cumulative distribution (FD) which is the integral of Eq. [1] from day j to day

We note that Eq. [2] is equivalent to a convolution integral of fD(t-j) with a delta function

The value of the corrected CFR was then calculated by adjusting the value of the corrected CFR

Optimization of the parameters of fD. The function fD was based on reports of the measured
onset (day of positive test) to fatality distributions for Chinese patients outside of Wuhan who
were infected in December and January by Linton et al. and Mizumoto et al.(3,33). These
investigators modeled the distributions as Log-normal functions that were corrected for right
censoring (fatalities missed due to the limited patient observation time). The best fitting

distributions from these sources were very similar, with Linton reporting a best fit median of
13.2 days with a 95% CI of 11.5 to 15.3 days, and Mizumoto et al. reporting a best fit median
(estimated from their reported log-mean value) of approximately 13 days.(33–35) Because two
other studies fitting to a different distribution function reported higher mean and extrapolated
median values, we decided to examine median values of 14, 17, and 21 days. The SD reported by
all studies, based on gamma fits, was very similar, and equivalent to a logSD of approximately
0.50 as reported by Mizumoto.(34,35)
For the least square fits, we first determined the corrected CFR from the data from Germany
using the time correction method described above for each of the distribution functions.
Germany was chosen because of the large number of cases compared to the other countries
analyzed; this minimizes statistical fluctuations in the early outbreak of the reported nCFR(t)
curve. Goodness of fit was then determined by calculating the least squares total residual by
squaring the differences between our calculated nCFR(t) (using the corrected CFR) and the
reported nCFR(t) values, and then summing those squares. The optimum parameter values were
determined based upon evaluating medians of 14, 17, and 21 days and for each value of the
median varying logSD from 0.25 to 0.75.
Model for calculating the corrected CFR based on the age distribution of positive cases in
the population and the age specific CFR values. Studies have reported that the nCFR for
COVID-19 strongly increases with age.(5–7,9–11,15,21,22,32–34) We determined for each
country the corrected CFR values for the fraction of a country’s populations of age 0-69, 70-79,
and 80 and above based on reports of the number of fatalities and number of cases in each age
range. The population below 70 years old was not further subdivided due to the relatively low
number of fatalities in this group in the countries with the least number of cases. The total
reported corrected CFR is then expressed by,
[5]

corrected CFR = cCFR (0-69)*p(0-69) + cCFR(70-79)*p(70-79) + cCFR(80+)*p(80+)

where p( ) is the proportion of the population in the relevant age group and the terms, cCFR( ),
are the corresponding corrected CFR for the population in that age-group. Table 3 gives the
values we calculated from the reported data of each country for cCFR(0-69), cCFR(70-79), and
cCFR (80+). Under the assumption that the age specific corrected CFR values for each country
analyzed was close to the true value, we used Eq. [5] to calculate the true corrected CFR for New
York City and China. To perform the calculation, we used the mean coefficients of all countries
analyzed for cCFR(0-60), cCFR(70-79), and cCFR(80+), and the reported values. The corrected
CFR for New York City and China were then determined based on their reported values of p(069), p(70-79), and p(80+). The IFR was calculated from the corrected CFR values based on the
assumption that the true CFR was achieved in the countries analyzed. A factor of 2 was then
used to convert the CFR to IFR based on reports of ½ of all COVID-19 cases being
asymptomatic and may have escaped detection.(2,31,36,37)
Calculation of the variation in each country’s corrected CFR values due to the case
population age distribution. We next tested how much of the variation in the corrected CFR
between countries was due to their age distribution. The corrected CFR was broken into two

old and below (CFR0-69).
[6]
corrected CFR = cCFR0-69 + cCFR70+
The terms in Eq. [6] were calculated for each country from the following expressions:
[7A]

cCFR70+ = cCFR(70+)*p(70+)

[7B]

cCFR0-69 = cCFR (0-69)*p(60-69)

To determine how much of the variation in cCFR70+ between countries that can be explained by
p(70+), we calculated the R2 of the least squares regression.
We further broke down cCFR70+ to understand how much of the variation could be explained by
the population in the 70-79 age group and 80+ age groups separately using Eq. [7C]:
[7C]

cCFR70+ = cCFR(70-79)*p(70-79) +cCFR(80+)*p(80+)

Simulation of the closed case CFR(t). To understand the basis for the apparent early
convergence of the closed case nCFR to the corrected CFR value, we calculated the cumulative
number of recoveries versus day after the outbreak using the above approach for calculating
cumulative fatalities (Appendix 5). Case per day data from South Korea and Germany were used
in the simulations. Based on recent reports (Verity, Bi) and earlier work by Ghani with SARS,
the distribution function for time to recovery fR is similar to that for fatality but with a median
shifted several days later and a less right skewed distribution.(1,5,32) Based on these reports, we
used a lognormal fR with a logSD of 0.25 and examined the effect of the median shift on the
convergence to the corrected CFR value of closed case CFR(t) curves.(5,32) The closed case
CFR(t) was calculated using the following formula,

Calculation of the percentage of the adult population of New York City that has been
infected with COVID-19 on April 22, 2020. We used our model to estimate the true corrected
CFR for New York City using the reported percentages of cases above 0-69, 70 – 79, and 80+
years old in Eq. [5] with the CFR() coefficients derived from the countries we analyzed.(31)
We then estimated the true IFR by dividing by 2, based on reports that up to half of the infected
cases in Iceland and the Diamond Princess cruise ship are asymptomatic.(6,13,34)
To estimate the total number of infected individuals in the population, we divided the time
corrected number of fatalities by the IFR.(31) The time correction factor (CFt) of 1.74 was
calculated from the new cases per day as described above. We assumed based upon a relatively
constant number of tests per day over this period that the captured cases would be proportional to
the total number of new cases per day in the population.(31,36,37)

For the total number of fatalities, we used the confirmed cases to attain a minimum estimate; we
then added probable fatalities for a maximum estimate. To determine the percent of the adult
population infected, we then divided the maximum and minimum number of infections by the
number of adults (over age 18) in New York City.(36) The adult population number was used
due to the random testing not including children, who are known to have a much lower
symptomatic and total infection rate than adults.(13,24–27) We also compared our calculations
with other models using their reported IFR values (Table 1) and Eq. [10].
Results
Increase in the reported nCFR(t) versus day after the start of the outbreak in five
countries. We found in all countries examined that the reported nCFR has risen throughout the
COVID-19 outbreak. As shown in Fig. 1, the value of the reported nCFR(t) for Germany rose
from a low value of 0.12% on March 10, 2020 to its present value of 4.36% on May 7, 2020. Our
estimate of the final CFR of 5.0% is shown as a dashed horizontal line. Figure 2 shows a similar
plot using the South Korean data, which rose from a low of 0.55% on March 8, 2020 to its value
on May 7, 2020 of 2.28%. The values shown are plotted from 10 days after the first 100 cases
were reported to avoid large fluctuations, these due to the low number of fatalities early in the
pandemic. In Appendix 3, we show that the nCFR versus day curves for Austria, Australia,
Iceland, Israel, and New Zealand exhibit the same trend.

Figure 1. Reported nCFR(t) increases with time after outbreak for Germany. The nCFR has
continuously increased with time after the outbreak, from a lowest value of 0.12% on March 10, 2020 to
its present value on May 7, 2020 of 4.36%. The dashed horizontal line at 5.0% is our estimate of the final
CFR from the closed case CFR value.

Figure 2. Reported nCFR(t) versus day after outbreak for South Korea. The nCFR for South
Korea is also seen to be continuously increasing from a minimum of 0.55% on March 8, 2020 to 2.28%
on May 7, 2020. Our estimate of the corrected CFR of 2.7% is shown as a dashed blue horizontal line.

al. (2020) analyzed the number of fatalities per day from Feb. 17, 2020 through March 3, 2020
and using a similar time correction approach to ours, we estimated that the final nCFR
(equivalent to corrected CFR since all cases were tested) would be 2.1% with 15 fatalities.(6)
Figure 3 plots the cumulative number of fatalities on each day after the ship docked. As of April
17, 2020, the number of fatalities is now 15 in agreement with this prediction.(6)

Figure 3. Total number of fatalities from February 17, 2020 to April 17, 2020 for the
Diamond Princess cruise ship. The solid horizontal line is the number of fatalities predicted if the
true CFR was 2.1% as predicted by Russell et al. using a similar time to fatality correction as (to) ours.(6)
The red dashed lines are the 95% CI for the estimate. As with the seven countries examined, the number
of fatalities continues to increase with time.

The reported closed case nCFR converges to a constant value before the nCFR. We found
that for the countries we examined, the closed case CFR appears to have converged to a constant
value prior to nCFR. In Figure 4, we plot the reported closed case nCFR(t) and nCFR(t) curves
from Germany as an example, showing clearly that the closed case nCFR has converged 48 days
prior to May 7, 2020, while the nCFR continues to increase. Appendix 2 shows that a similar
convergence has occurred for Australia, Austria, Iceland, Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea.

Figure 4. Closed case CFR(t) and nCFR(t) versus day for Germany. As shown by the top
curve, the closed case fatality ratio appears to be converging to a near constant value. In contrast the
nCFR continues to climb, and as of May 7, 2020, is still well below the closed case CFR.
Estimation of the corrected CFR from the closed case CFR and time to fatality correction
of the reported nCFR. As described in Calculations, we calculated the corrected CFR using two

Assessment of the accuracy of determining closed case CFR by time correction early in an
outbreak when the reported nCFR is several fold below the final value. In order to determine
ne
whether the nCFR(t) curve could be used throughout to predict an accurate corrected CFR value,
we performed simulations in which we generated predicted nCFR(t) curves for different CFR
values. Figure 5A and 5B show the simulated nCFR(t) and ND(t) curves for Germany using
corrected CFR values of 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, 5.0% (the final corrected CFR value
denoted by an asterisk), and 6.0%. It is seen that the simulated nCFR(t) curve using this value is
in sound agreement with the reported nCFR(t) data, even when the reported nCFR was well
%
below 1.0%. In contrast, the curves consistent with previous corrected CFR estimates in the 0.5%
to 1.0% range (Table 1) poorly fit the reported nCFR(t) data at all times. We found similar
results for the other countries analyzed (Appendix 2), although with more variation in countries
al
with low numbers of total cases (e.g. Australia, Iceland, New Zealand), possibly due to statistical
fluctuations in the number of fatalities at early times.

Figure 5A. Simulated and reported ND(t) versus day curves for the Germany. The black
curve is the reported data. The best match to the reported data throughout most of the outbreak is for the
final corrected CFR of approximately 5.0%, which is the same as the measured closed case CFR on May
7, 2020.

Figure 5B. Simulated and reported nCFR(t) versus day curves for Germany. The reported
nCFR(t) curve is plotted in black. Even though the reported nCFR(t) curve rises continuously, it is well
matched throughout the duration by the calculated nCFR(t) curve (blue), with the final corrected CFR of
5.0%. This corrected CFR is over 10-fold higher than the reported nCFR values early in the outbreak.

Determination of how much of the variation in the corrected CFR between countries can be
explained by the percentage of cases 70 years old and above. Several reports have indicated
that there is a sharp increase in the CFR from COVID-19 above approximately 70 years old and
these cases account for the majority of fatalities.(6,15) However, the reported values may be
biased due to countries prioritizing the testing of high risk individuals in older age ranges. In
le
order to assess these values under the conditions of minimum bias in testing we tabulated (Table
3) for each country the values of the corrected CFR for each age group (CFR(0-69), CFR(7079), CFR(80+), CFR(70+)), the percentage of the case population in each group (p(0-69), p(7079), p(80+), p(70+)) and the contribution of each group to the overall corrected CFR (CFR0-69,
CFR70-79, CFR80+, CFR70+).
Figure 6A plots the two components of the cCFR for each country comprising cases 0-69 years
old (cCFR0-69, green) and the cases 70 years old and above (cCFR70+, blue) versus p(70+). It is
seen that for all countries, cCFR70+ is the major component of the CFR with the ratio
cCFR70+/cCFR having a mean value of 81% with an SD of +/- 8% (Table 3, note that this is also
the ratio of total fatalities in the 70+ age range to total fatalities). To determine how much of the
variation in this component could be explained by the percentage of cases 70 and above, as
opposed to variations in testing, we performed a regression analysis against p(70+) giving:
[11]

cCFR70+ = 0.23*p(70+) – 0.639

R2 = 0.82

In order to assess whether additional variation could be explained by the relative percentage of
cases 80 years old and above (p(80+)) in the 70+ age group, we calculated using the measured
cCFR(80) values and adjusted cCFR70+ for each country (cCFR70+A) for a constant ratio of
p(80+)/p(70+) of 0.40. This ratio was chosen to be the mean value of the seven countries (Table

3). As shown in Figure 6B, linear regression of cCFR70+A against p(70+) showed a reduction in
variation relative to Eq. [11].
[12]

cCFR70+A = 0.195*p(70+) – 0.263

R2 = 0.89

In order to further test the importance of age in explaining the variation between countries we
calculated the slope for Eq. [12] using the values of CFR(70-79) and CFR(80+) from each
country and Eq. [8]. This method gave a mean slope of 0.167 with a 95% CI of the mean of
0.129- 0.204, which is within error the same as the slope determined by linear regression value.
Although the age group below 70 years old only accounted for on average 19.1% of the fatalities
(and the same percentage of the total cCFR as shown in Fig. 6A), we still found that this group
was a significant factor in overall mortality, with an average cCFR0-69 being 0.41% (Table 3).
There was also weak dependence of cCFR0-69 with p(70+) (slope = 0.05, R2 = 0.72).

Figure 6. Linear regression analysis of cCFR70+, cCFR70+A, and cCFR0-69 versus percent of
cases 70 years old and above (p(70+)).
Figure 6A shows a plot of cCFR70+ (blue) and cCFR0-69 (green) for each country versus the percent of
cases 70 years old and above ( p(70+) The total corrected CFR for each country is given by cCFR=
cCFR70+ + cCFR69. It is seen that for all countries the cCFR70 term explains the large majority of cCFR
(81% +/- 8%). The majority of the variance in cCFR70 is explained by cases 70 years old and above (R2 =
0.82). The contribution to cCFR from cases 69 years old and younger showed a weak dependence on
p(70+) (slope= 0.05, R2 = 0.72).
Figure 6B shows a plot of cCFR70+A (blue) for each country. The value of cCFR70+A for each country was
as
calculated by adjusting the fraction of cases in the 70 and over group who are 80 years old and above to
be 40% (p(80+)/p(70+) = 0.40), which is the mean of the countries examined (Table 3). The higher
fraction of the variance explained by age for cCFR70+A (R2 = 0.89) indicates that cases 80 years and over
are an important factor in the overall cCFR.

Estimation of the corrected CFR for China as of February 11, 2020 and New York City as
of April 22, 2020. We applied the linear model described in Eq. [5] to predict the corrected CFR
R
based on the age distribution of cases in China on February 11, 2020 (WHO).(2) Based on the
percentage of cases from 70 to 79 (9%) and 80 and above (3%), the model predicted a corrected
CFR of 2.19% with a 95% CI of the mean: 1.54%-2.85%. We performed a similar calculation
based on the age distribution of positive cases in New York City as of April 22, 2020 with 9% of
cases between 70 and 79 years old and 8% 80 years old and older.(31,36,37) Due to the greater
percentage of cases in both categories, the corrected CFR for New York City was predicted to be
3.60%, with a 95% CI of the mean: 2.73%-4.47%.
Estimation of the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in New York City.
As described in the Calculations, in order to validate the model, we calculated the percentage of

maximum and minimum value based on whether unconfirmed but probable fatalities were

agreement with two recent studies that randomly tested individuals in the NYC adult population
of 15.3% and 21%, respectively (blue bars).(15,16) Also plotted are the predictions from
previously reported true IFR calculations that have been applied to estimate fatalities in the
United States and United Kingdom (Table 1). For the other IFR values only confirmed COVID19 fatalities were included. As seen in the graph, other than Modi (2020) and the Imperial
College model, the estimated percentages of the population infected are several fold above the
reported values.(5,11)

Figure 7. Reported percentage of New York City adults infected with COVID-19 versus
calculated using our and other reported IFR values. As shown in the inset, the predicted
maximum and minimum percent of the population in New York City infected with COVID-19 is in
logical (good) agreement with recent reports based on random testing.(15,16) For comparison, we
calculated the percentage of the population infected, and then predicted using previous reported IFR
values for New York City, the United States, and the United Kingdom (see Table 1).

Discussion
To obtain an estimate of the true CFR for COVID-19, we focused on countries with extensive
testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (Appendix 4), and with access to modern
medical care. We assumed that the corrected CFR from these countries represents a conservativee
estimate of their true CFR, without the need to introduce potentially large corrections for missed
d
cases.(3–11,20–22,34) We found that in all cases there was a several fold increase in the reported
ed
n CFR, which could be accounted for by the same distribution function describing the delay
between diagnosis and fatality. Despite the high level of testing we found a wide range of
corrected CFR values for these countries (from 0.7% to 5.0%). However, on average 81% (95%
CI of mean: 72.39%- 89.26%) of the total CFR was due to the cases 70 years old and above.
When we examined the component of the CFR due to this population (cCFR70+) separately, we
found that 89% of its variance was explained by a linear model based upon the percentage of
cases 70-79 and 80 and above years old. The remaining component of the corrected CFR was
relatively stable between countries with a mean value of 0.41% and 95% CI of the mean of

0.21%-0.62%. We tested the model by using it to calculate the true CFR and IFR for New York
City where there is a large infected population that has recently undergone several studies
performing random testing. Our estimated corrected IFR value for New York City of 1.80% as of
April 22, 2020 was 2 to 16.5-fold higher than previous values that have been applied to the US
and UK (Table 1). However, its prediction that between 14.69% and 22.05% of the New York
City adult population has been exposed to COVID-19 gave the best agreement with the results of
random testing studies in New York City at or near April 22, 2020 (15.3% - 21%, Figure 7).(15–
17) In contrast, previous IFR values used in epidemiological models for forecasting fatalities in
the United States and United Kingdom predicted values between 1.5 and 10 fold higher. We
discuss below the potential sources of difference between our study and previous CFR and IFR
calculations, and the relative strengths and limitations of our approach.
Our calculated corrected CFR for China was 2.19% with a 95% CI of the mean: 1.54%-2.85%,
which was considerably lower than for New York City due to the lower fraction of cases
between 70 and 79 and 80 and over years old, but higher than the majority but not all of the
previously reported values (Table 1), which ranged from 0.9 to 5.6%. Almost all of the studies
that calculated an IFR/CFR using data from China performed a time correction similar to that
applied here, so that it is unlikely that the time delay to fatality significantly contributed to their
lower corrected CFR values.(3,5–7,20–23) A more likely factor explaining the differences
between values is the correction for missed cases, which ranged from 1.0 to approximately
4.(20,23) In addition to uncertainties in determining missed cases, a significant amount of the
difference can be accounted for when previous values are scaled up by 1.5 fold to match the
recent report of the Chinese government of undercounted fatalities.(2)
The reported nCFR(t) versus day data shows clearly that the nCFR(t) values have all risen at
least several fold from the early values used to justify low estimates of the IFR for COVID-19
(see Figures 5A, 5B, and Appendix 3).(12,14,24–27,30) We therefore calculated the corrected
CFR for each country using both the earlier convergence of the closed case CFR to a final value,
and a conventional time to fatality correction method.(5–7,23,32,33). In all cases the corrected
CFR calculated using both methods were similar (Table 2). As shown in Figure 2, the closed
case CFR for Germany converged to its final value 44 days before May 7, 2020, while the
reported nCFR is still rising, and similar early convergence was seen in all of the other countries
evaluated (Appendix 1). The simulations in Appendix 5 show that the convergence time to the
final corrected CFR value for the closed case CFR primarily depends on the separation of the
median days to fatality versus the median days to recovery with the fastest convergence when the
medians are the same. We also found that the time to fatality correction method for calculating
the corrected CFR worked well at early times when the reported nCFR values were several times
higher than the reported values on May 7, 2020. Therefore, both methods should be useful early
in an outbreak to provide a more accurate measure than the uncorrected nCFR.
We did not factor in preexisting conditions in our analysis which has been reported as
significantly affecting mortality.(15,17,26,31,36,37) The high R2 values we found for the
cCFR70+ component (0.82 and 0.89) suggests that other risk factors than age were similar
between the countries we analyzed. However, it is likely that the ability to extrapolate from our
findings to other countries would be improved if preexisting conditions and other risk factors that
may be differentially present were included in our model.

The corrected CFR between countries for the under 70 years old component (cCFR0-69), was
considerably lower than the cCFR70 in all cases, mean 0.41% with a 95% CI of the mean: 0.21%0.62%. It is likely based on other reports that the variation in cCFR0-69 could be explained by the
fraction of the case population in the 60 – 69 group which also has a highly elevated risk.(13,24–
27) However due to the low number of fatalities in several countries in the 0- 69 age groups we
did not perform a sub analysis.
To calculate the IFR for New York City, we divided the calculated corrected CFR by a factor of
2, based on reports from the Diamond Princess and Iceland, that half of COVID-19 cases are
asymptomatic. This value may be an overestimate, as shown by Mizumoto, because these reports
did not take into account the lag between infection and the onset of symptoms, which led him to
revise the true asymptomatic case number for the Diamond Princess to approximately 30%.(34)
A potential confound in our approach is that the time correction of the reported number of
fatalities is based upon the assumption that the percentage of missed cases was constant, since all
symptomatic cases were not captured. The validity of this assumption was supported by data
from the New York City Department of Health that the number of tests per day was close to
constant during the period up to April 22, 2020.(31,36,37) We note that in the extreme alternate
possibility in which none of the active cases as of April 22, 2020 subsequently died the percent
of infections calculated would range from 8.6% to 13.0%.
Our calculation of the minimum and maximum percentage of the adult population in New York
City that has been infected by COVID-19 agreed with the recent studies that performed random
testing of segments of the adult population (Figure 7).(15–17) In one study, 15.3% of women
entering two New York City hospitals to give birth were found by testing to be infected with
COVID-19 (33 out of 215 having the virus).(16) In the second study the New York City infected
population was estimated at 21%, this from 3000 serological antibody-based measurements of
passersby at testing stations near public areas in New York City and other regions in New York
State (with the results reported on April 22, 2020).(15) The New York City findings were
replicated from subsequent testing of 5500 cases reported April 28, 2020 (24% infected) and
15,500 cases reported on May 2, 2020 (19.9% infected). Due to the heterogeneity in COVID-19
fatalities and cases within even New York City, and due to the restricted age range of the groups
examined (18 – 75 for the New York State study), these percent infection values may be
overestimates.(31,36) However, given that the large majority of cases in New York City are
between ages 18 and 75, it is unlikely that this bias would have a large impact.
As shown in Figure 7, the predicted infection percentage for the adult New York City population
using the IFR values from previous models was between 1.5 and 10-fold higher than the actual
reports as well as our predictions. The closest IFR values to ours were reported by Modi et al.
and the Imperial College model.(11,19) The model of Modi estimated the New York City IRF
based upon the difference between reported fatalities during the outbreak versus a similar period
of time, and corrected for age distribution of positive cases.(11) No time correction was used to
correct the IFR due to the investigators wanting to report a most conservative value. To compare
with our predictions, we applied the same time to fatality correction to the Modi IFR that we
used in our model. This increased its IFR to 0.88%, similar to the value of 0.90% used in the
Imperial College model.(5)

Much lower estimates of the IFR have recently been reported based on serological antibody
testing in Santa Clara County in early April of 0.13% – 0.2%.(8) A potential explanation for the
difference from our estimates is that the actual percentage measuring positive in their study was
low, between 2.49% and 4.16%. A recent study that has evaluated available serological testing
platforms found that the fraction of false positives can exceed this range.(38) The impact of false
positives is likely to be less significant for the New York State study because of the much higher
true percentage of the New York City population that is infected. Additional validation of the
New York results is from their finding consistently of low infection percentages (~ 1.0%) in
several regions in New York State outside of the New York City metro area which supports a
relatively low false positive rate.(15,17,31)
Having an accurate value of the true CFR and IFR is vitally important for modeling the total
number of fatalities from COVID-19. As shown in Figure 7 the IFR values used in several
leading epidemiological models are not compatible with the number of infections in New York
City. It has been shown that an increase of IFR from 0.25% to 0.5%, approximately doubled
projected fatalities with other factors held constant.(28) Although our approach is less
sophisticated than missed case correction it explains the majority of the variation in the countries
examined and is consistent with the most reliable random population testing study available.
Therefore, it should be valuable for providing at conservative upper CFR and IFR bound for
epidemiological models of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table 3: Age specific fractions of cases, age specific corrected CFR, and contributions of each age group to the overall
corrected CFR for each country. Definitions: p( ) is the proportion of the population in the relevant age group; cCFR(80+) is the cCFR for
cases 80 years old and above; cCFR(70-79) is the cCFR for cases 70 – 79 years old; cCFR(70+) is the cCFR for cases 70 years old and above;
cCFR(0-69) is the cCFR for all cases 69 years old and below; cCFR70+ is the contribution to the overall cCFR from all cases 70 years old and
above; cCFR0-69 is the contribution to cCFR from all cases 69 years old and below. The subscript A refers to cCFR70+ values corrected to have a
fraction of 40% of cases 80 years old and above. The value was chosen to match the mean from all countries except New Zealand (which has not
reported this value and therefore it was assumed to be the same as the mean of the other countries). Data was obtained from the following
references.(1–8)
