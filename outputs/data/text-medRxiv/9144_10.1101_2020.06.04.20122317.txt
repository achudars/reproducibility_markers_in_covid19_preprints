The Covid-19 pandemic has been associated with a reduction in hospitalization for
acute cardiovascular conditions.1234 In a major health system in Massachusetts, there
was a 43% reduction in these types of hospitalizations in March 2020 compared with
March 2019.4 Whether mortality rates from heart disease have changed over this
period is unknown.
Accordingly, we assembled data on weekly heart disease deaths in Massachusetts
from the National Center for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) for 118,356,533 person-weeks from Week 1 (ending January 4) through
Week 17 (ending April 25) of 2020.5 A total of 4,085 heart disease deaths were
recorded during this period (incidence rate, 3.5 per 100,000 person-weeks; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 3.4 to 3.6), versus 4,209 heart disease deaths over the same
period in 2019 (incidence rate, 3.6 per 100,000 person-weeks; 95% CI, 3.5 to 3.7)
(incidence rate ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.01) (Figure 1). Covid-19 deaths and
overall deaths from all causes, for comparison, markedly rose over the study period.
There are several feasible explanations for these findings. It is possible that some
cardiovascular deaths could be incorrectly attributed and coded as Covid-19 deaths,
though there is not routine post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 testing of patients who died in
non-medical settings, nor instructions to medical officials to presume deaths of
unknown cause to be coded as Covid-19-related in Massachusetts. The observed
>40% decline in hospitalizations, while large, may not be associated with a decline in
cardiovascular deaths, owing to the relatively low number of related modifiable deaths
during the short time period of interest. There could be an actual decline in acute
cardiovascular emergencies as a result of changes in exposures and behaviors during
the Covid-19 shutdown. Finally, the reporting of cardiovascular deaths may not yet be
sufficiently complete for 2020. However, the CDC reports that the currently available
figures are estimated to be greater than 98.3% to 99.3% complete for the weeks
reported here, and the final 0.7% to 1.7% is unlikely to change the qualitative
conclusions (Supplementary Appendix, Table S1).6
These findings add more information to the pursuit of understanding the change in
cardiovascular healthcare utilization during the Covid-19 outbreak in the United
States but are unable to identify any definitive cause. For now, the information is at
least reassuring that there was not a marked increase in cardiovascular deaths in
Massachusetts during the early phase of the outbreak, despite a decrease in the
number of patients seeking acute care for related emergencies.

Shown are data from Massachusetts. The data shown in orange are the reported weekly incidence
rates of heart disease per 100,000 person-weeks during the period from Week 1 through Week
17, 2020. The data shown in blue are the reported weekly incidence rates of heart disease per
100,000 person-weeks during the period from Week 1 through Week 17, 2019.  bars indicate
95% confidence intervals. The data shown in gray are the rates for Covid-19 deaths per 100,000
person-weeks for the same period, with the first Massachusetts death reported March 26, 2020.
The data shown in yellow are the numbers of all-cause deaths per 100,000 person-weeks.
