Abstract
When the population risk factors and reporting systems are similar, the
assessment of the case-fatality (or lethality) rate (ratio of cases to deaths) represents
a perfect tool for analyzing, understanding and improving the overall efficiency of the
health system.
The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system
on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by
analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate between French
districts (i.e. French départements).
The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly
related to the level of morbidity, therefore to the overwhelming of the healthcare
systems during the acute phases of the epidemic. However, the magnitude of this
increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average casefatality rate and cannot explain the magnitude of the variations in case-fatality rate
reported per country by international organizations or information sites. These
differences can only be explained by the systems for reporting cases and deaths,
which, indeed, vary greatly from country to country, and not attributed to the care or
treatment of patients, even during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.

Introduction
Since the beginning of the epidemic, the lethality rate, or case-fatality rate (CFR)
of COVID-19 and the differences between countries have been the subject of many

an issue that has been addressed since the beginning of the epidemic [MOR 20] [RIN
20] [SPY 20] [BAU 20].
The case-fatality rate is the ratio between the number of closed cases (i.e.
recovered or dead) and the number of deaths due to the disease. It is estimated by the
healthcare system based on the reporting of these two values. The case-fatality rate
should not be confused with the mortality rate, which is the ratio of the number of
deaths to the total population, or also with the morbidity rate, which is the ratio of the
number of cases to the total population. Mortality and morbidity rates depend on the
extent of disease in a population, unlike case-fatality rates, which are normally
calculated independently of the number of infected persons [POR 08].
The case-fatality rate of a disease in a population is an index of severity of the
disease in that population, and of the capacity of the healthcare system to reduce
mortality. In principle, this allows to compare the effectiveness of healthcare systems
across regions or countries.
The aim of this article is to analyze the effectiveness of the healthcare system in
France in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Based on spatial differences in
lethality, this study ultimately shows that the case-fatality rates published by the
international agency by country (May 2020) do not allow to compare the country one
to the others.
Lethality depends on the intrinsic virulence of the virus but, unlike morbidity, it does
not depend on its contagiousness. Virulence comes from the reproductive capacity of
the virus in the cell, its capacity for cellular degradation, and its ability to induce or not
an innate or specific immune response. Virulence is of purely biological origin and once
the virus has entered the target cell where it will cause its pathogenic effect does no
longer depends on environmental conditions outside the host. Virulence is independent
of the host population, but may change over time and space if there is a risk of natural
mutation/selection of the pathogen. Contagiousness characterizes the biological
capacity of the virus to reach the target cell system of its host, and the ability to be
transmitted from one individual to another. The efficiency of transmission depends
largely on environmental conditions (e.g., climate, urbanization, population density,
mobility), which can vary greatly from one country to another.
In addition to the virulence of the virus, the case-fatality rate depends on biological
risk factors and on population vulnerability (age structure, genetic factors, prevalence
of co-morbidities, healthcare accessibility, etc.) as well as other factors related to the
health system (equipment, capacity, staff, management, care of patients, effectiveness
of therapies, patient management in a critical phase of the disease), and factors related
to the detection and registration system for cases and deaths (clinical cases definition,
detection, surveillance systems, case and death reporting). The evaluation of the casefatality rate normally requires the detection and counting of all infected persons,
irrespective of their level of symptoms (i.e. disease severity).
When the population risk factors and reporting systems are identical, case-fatality
rate evaluation represents an excellent tool for analyzing, understanding and improving
the overall performance of the health system, particularly at the level of hospital units.

Studying the magnitude of differences in case-fatality rates between units also makes
it possible to assess the impact of the quality of the health system on case-fatality.
There are large differences in the case-fatality rates of COVID-19 published by
country (Table 1) or calculated directly from WHO data. These rates vary considerably,
from less than 0.02 (Thailand, Australia, Chile) to more than 0.15 (France, Belgium,
UK), with a mean at 0.04 and a standard deviation of 0.045 (WHO, May 8, 2020, Figure

In Europe, the characteristics of populations (in terms of risk factor for COVID-19)
and health systems are comparable, but the definition, detection and reporting of cases
and causes of death can differ greatly from one country to another. Some countries
conducted significantly more detection tests and hospitalizations than others (Table 2),
resulting in differences in the protocols for patient management. The rate of testing
performed (policy) and mortality rates (reporting) vary mainly according to the
geographical extent of the epidemic within each country.

The virulence of the COVID-19 pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is assumed to be
identical in all countries. In order to compare case-fatality rates across regions or
countries (and thus analyze the effectiveness of healthcare systems), it is necessary,
when calculating rates, to standardize population-related risk factors and to use the
same definitions and enumeration methods to record cases and deaths. This is not the
case for the current pandemic and discrepancies exist among the country systems.
The objective of this article is not to estimate the actual lethality of COVID-19 in
France based on the rates published by the health authorities, but to estimate the
influence of the healthcare system on lethality by analyzing the spatial variability of the
hospital case-fatality rate (confirmed hospitalized cases and hospital deaths) in
metropolitan France between districts (i.e. French départements). This analysis,
limited to metropolitan France, is possible while it remains within the framework of the
same system for defining and counting cases and deaths. We thus assume that this
system of definition and enumeration was identical throughout France during the
period (19 March to 8 May) corresponding to the first wave (inception) of the COVID19 epidemic in France. Therefore the study focuses on the extent of spatial differences
in the case-fatality rate in metropolitan France, and enables to highlight the relative
differences between districts, as well as to analyze the causes independently of the
system of definition and enumeration of cases and deaths, and also independently of
the main biological risk factor of severity (age) after standardization on this factor.
Estimating the variability of the case-fatality rate attributable exclusively to hospital
care of patients will then allows us to compare the case-fatality rate observed in
metropolitan France with the one calculated for other countries. It will allow us to
estimate whether the variability of the case-fatality rate due to the management of

patients in the acute epidemic phase can exclusively explain the significant differences
in case-fatality rates observed between countries.

Data and Methods
Data
This study is based on daily hospitalization and death declaration data by district
in France and is accessible on the “Santé Publique France” website.
(www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-hospitalieres-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid19) from March 19 to May 8, 2020, corresponding to 50 days lockdown (i.e. quarantine)
and the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in France (Figure 2). We also obtain
demographic data by districts (source: population by age, INSEE, 2020), as well as
data on the distribution of hospitalized cases according to age group (10-year age
group) (Santé Publique France).

This analysis was carried out on the 96 districts of metropolitan France (Figure 3),
while the French overseas districts and territories were excluded from the analysis for
reasons of spatial analysis and mapping. The data were integrated into a geographic
information system (SavGIS, ww.savgis.org) for analysis and mapping.

Figure 3. The 96 Districts of Metropolitan France

Focusing only on confirmed hospitalized cases and deaths in hospital, the casefatality rates calculated in this article for France refer to the hospital case-fatality rates
and do not represent the absolute national case-fatality that should include all positive
cases and deaths related to COVID-19. Given the estimated high number of nonsevere and asymptomatic forms (which a fortiori do not cause deaths) - it is estimated
that only 2.6% of infected persons were hospitalized [SAL 20] - this overall lethality is
necessarily much lower than hospital lethality, but it will be accurately calculated only
at the end of the epidemic when the total number of positive cases (I.e. seroprevalence
survey) will be available and the total number of deaths outside hospital due to COVID19 will be accurately assessed.
All identified and hospitalized cases were tested positive (by rtPCR). All deaths
counted were COVID-19 associated. As of May 8, 2020, not all hospitalized cases are
closed since the epidemic is still ongoing: deaths counted at the beginning of the study
period correspond to cases hospitalized but were not included in the study, and cases
counted at the end of the period were not closed and no deaths from these cases were
included in the study.

Methods
Age standardization
Since age is a major risk factor for death, age standardization eliminates
differences in hospitalization rates, mortality rates, or case-fatality rates between
districts due to differences in the age structure of the population of the districts, We
performed an indirect standardization by calculating the rate (hospitalization rate and
hospital rate) per ten-year age group for the whole of France. Then also lethality rate
for the whole of France was calculated but excluding areas that have been under
hospital stress (Ile-de-France and Grand-Est). This was done in order to evaluate
hospital case-fatality rates per age group independently of possible excess mortality
due to the saturation of healthcare systems in certain districts. Classically, 𝐸𝑖 (number
of deaths expected in district 𝑖) is the sum over the different age groups of the district's
population in the age group multiplied by the hospital case-fatality rate of the age
group:
𝐸𝑖 =

∑

𝑃𝑎 × 𝑇𝑎

𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑎

where 𝑃𝑎 is the population of the age group “a” and 𝑇𝑎 is the hospital case-fatality
rate of the age group calculated over all districts.

Standardized case-fatality rate
The Standardized Lethality Ratio (SLR) is equal to the ratio between the observed
death toll 𝑂𝑖 and the expected death toll 𝐸𝑖. The standardized hospital case-fatality
rate 𝐿𝑆𝑖 for each district is equal to the average rate for France multiplied by the
district's SLR. The significance of the SLR (H0: SLR=1, no statistically significant over
- or under-fatality compared to the expected value) is evaluated for each district by a
Breslow & Day test [BRE 87] in order to account for the statistical significance of the
differences in these ratios between districts. In order to take into account the problem
of multiple testing [MIL 96] when the null hypothesis concerns the whole territory (“is
there a district for which the H0 hypothesis is rejected?”), the risk of error was set at
0.0005 in order to apply a Bonferonni correction (which is very conservative when data
is spatially autocorrelated). When the study is conducted for a single district (“Is the
SLR for this district different from 1?”), the risk of error is set at 0.05. All tests are
bilateral.

Cartography
The values of morbidity rates, mortality rates, non-standardized case-fatality rates,
SLRs and their significance were mapped by districts. In order to map case-fatality
rates independently of the rate calculation variability, due to differences in
hospitalization numbers between districts, rates adjusted with empirical Bayesian
estimator (EBE) were calculated [SOU 19]. All statistical and spatial analysis and
mapping were carried out using the SavGIS geographic information system.

Study of statistical correlations

In order to estimate whether possible congestion in the healthcare system
influenced hospital case-fatality rate, we studied the correlations between
hospitalization and hospital lethality in a global manner over the entire period. Inpatient
severity was estimated using the ICU rate (number of patients in intensive care/number
of inpatients).

Results
For the whole of France (data from 19 March to 8 May 2020), the hospital casefatality rate was 0.174. The average hospital case-fatality rates by age group, used in
indirect standardization, was calculated from French Public Health data by age class
published on 8 May 2020 (Table 3).

Table 3. Hospitalization, mortality and case-fatality rates by age group in metropolitan France
(2020). Region 11 is Ile-de-France, region 14 is Grand-Est.

The epidemic in France (data from 19 March to 8 May 2020) presents a very
uneven spatial distribution of hospitalizations. It has developed throughout the country
at low level, with a mean hospitalization rate of 1.27 per 1,000 (median at 0.88) and a
standard deviation of 1.03, except in some regions where transmission has been much
more active, such as the Ile-de-France region (mean hospitalization rate 3.01 per
1,000), or the Grand-Est region (mean hospitalization rate 3.2 per 1,000). The mean
hospitalization rate varies from 0.19 per 1,000 (Tarn-et-Garonne) to 4.75 (Territoire de
Belfort) (Figure 4).
The hospital mortality rate (not age-standardized) has the same spatial distribution.
It varies from 0.01 per 1,000 (Tarn-et-Garonne) to 1.13 per 1,000 (Territoire de Belfort),
with a mean of 0.21 (median 0.12) and a standard deviation of 0.21.

The observed gross hospital case-fatality rate calculated by district showed a
mean of 0.153 with a standard deviation of 0.045. It varies between 0.046 (Ariège) and
0.258 (Vosges). Without the Ile-de-France and Grand-Est regions, the mean gross

Case-fatality rates have evolved over the period studied. Here we represent nonstandardized rates calculated for three periods: March 19 to 31; April 1 to 12; April 13
to 25. Rates are calculated with a 12-day time lag between cases and deaths (Figure
7).

The standardized case-fatality rate per district is between 0.044 (Ariège,
SLR=0.25) and 0.255 (Vosges, SLR=1.48), with the mean at 0.151 and the median at
0.153. If the Ile-de-France and Grand-Est regions are excluded from the calculation of
age-specific case-fatality rates, the CFR is between 0.044 and 0.251, with the mean
at 0.144 and a median at 0.147 (SLR between 0.28 and 1.67, mean at 0.99 and median
at 1) (Figure 8). In the following, we will consider only the standardized case-fatality
rates calculated with age-specific case-fatality rates that do not take into account the
Ile-de-France and Grand-Est regions.

period March 19 to May 8, 2020.

The spatial distribution of standardized morbidity rate (hospitalized cases) shows
a significant spatial autocorrelation (Moran index: 1.54, p-value < 10-6), and this is
expected for an infectious disease. The case-fatality rate shows also significant spatial
autocorrelation (Moran index: 0.29, p-value < 0.000007), and this is no expected. The
analysis of the clusters clearly shows a clustering of high case-fatality rate values in
regions of high morbidity (particularly the Grand-Est), and shows some cases of
districts with high case-fatality rate values isolated in areas with low rates.
The Breslow & Day significance test shows districts where the SLR is statistically
significantly different from 1, corresponding to districts with abnormally high (SLR > 1,

There is a correlation between the standardized hospitalization rate and the
standardized case-fatality rate (Bravais-Pearson index=0.40) (Figure 10), a correlation
which increases (0.48) if we limit the calculation to districts whose SLR is significantly
different from 1 (p-value < 0.05).

districts with a low hospitalization rate (less than 0.5 per 1000) to 0.152 for all districts.
If only districts with high hospitalization rates (above 2 per 1000) are considered, the
average case-fatality rate is 0.183. For the eight districts with the highest
hospitalization rates (> 3 per 1,000), and considered as district under hospital stress,
the average case-fatality rate is 0.191 (Meuse, Moselle, Seine-St-Denis, Hauts-deSeine, Paris, Val-de-Marne, Haut-Rhin, Territoire de Belfort), while it is 0.149 for all
other districts.

A typology combining hospitalization rates and case-fatality rates is proposed: low
rates (values below the mean by less than one standard deviation), high rates (values
above the mean by more than one standard deviation), so as to represent five classes
(low-low, low-high, high-low, high-high, other) (Figure 12). The "high hospitalizationhigh case-fatality rate" class is spatially clustered. The "low hospitalization rate-high
lethality rate" class is dispersed, and the population density is significantly lower in that
class than in all the other districts (p-value < 0.02).

The ratio between the rate of patients in intensive care and the rate of
hospitalization gives in principle an indication of the severity of the patients in hospital.
This hospitalization rate and severity rate show a weak negative correlation (r=-0.22),
indicating a decrease in the intensive care rate when the hospitalization rate is high.
This trend may be due to the saturation of intensive care units. The relationship
between hospitalization and severity could also be interpreted as a decrease in less
severe hospitalizations in order to be able to manage more severe cases when the
healthcare system is overloaded, which would result in an increase in lethality.
Nevertheless, in both cases, there is no correlation between the severity rate and the
case-fatality rate (r=-0.1), indicating that globally, the intensity of reanimation does not
impact the case-fatality rate. Finally, the severity rate does not have a spatial

Discussion
The standardized case-fatality rates of the districts in France (0.04 for Tarn-etGaronne to 0.26 for the Vosges district) remain in a ratio of 0.3 to 1.6 compared with
the national average (mean 0.14, calculated by excluding districts under hospital stress
in order not to take account of possible overloading of the healthcare systems). The
relationships between morbidity rates and standardized case-fatality rates in France
show a correlation between these two indices, the average case-fatality rate for all
districts being about 15% higher than the average rate calculated in the 20% of districts
with the lowest hospitalization rates. It is therefore very likely that the increase in
hospital tension over the period under consideration has increased the hospital casefatality rate: for the 20 districts with the highest hospitalization rates (essentially located
in the Grand-Est and Ile-de-France regions), the average case-fatality rate is 20 per
cent higher than the average for all districts, and 25 per cent higher than the average
for all other districts alone. It is therefore likely that pressure on hospitals have
increased the national average case-fatality rate by district from 0.145 to 0.153. It can
thus be estimated that 2,425 deaths (out of the 16,732 deaths due to COVID-19 in
hospital in France from 19 March to 8 May 2020, i.e. 15% of the total number of deaths)

are due to the overload of the health system in the Grand-Est and Ile-de-France
regions.
There are clearly two risk profiles:
1/ the districts where a high rate of hospitalization is coupled with a high casefatality rate. These districts correspond to the epicenters of the epidemic, are clustered,
and include the densely populated areas of Ile-de-France.
2/ the districts where a low rate of hospitalization is coupled with a high case-fatality
rate. These districts are geographically dispersed, sparsely populated and mainly
located in rural areas.
The first profile accounts for 60% of the patients (59,878 over 99,970). The case-fatality
average for this profile is significantly higher (0.187) as compared with the other
districts case-fatality average (0.138). The profile displays a 33% excess mortality,
corresponding to 2,716 deaths (11,003 observed vs. 8,287 expected with the CFR
0.138). This excess mortality, corresponding to 16 % of all deaths, is likely to be the
result of increased lethality due to overloading of the healthcare system.
The second profile (more rural) accounts for only 12.5% of the patients (12,514 over
99,970), with an average case-fatality rate significantly high (0.178) corresponding to
a 25% excess mortality (2,170 observed vs. 1,731 expected deaths), but of low
magnitude. It is possible that this excess mortality is due to a lack of care (medical
desert, poor hospital response), which would have led to an increase in hospital
lethality.
Some districts in the south of France have both a very low rate of hospitalization
and a very low case-fatality rate (Gironde, Dordogne, Gers, Pyrénées Orientales), as
a result of the low circulation of the virus and the effective response of the health
system. Another particular case, is the one of the Bouches-du-Rhône, which appears
with a high hospitalization rate (1.96 per 1,000, for a national average of 1.27) and a
low case-fatality rate (0.11 for the Bouches-du-Rhône for a national average per district
of 0.15). This situation could be due to a medical policy of more active screening and
earlier hospitalization of the infected in the district, particularly in Marseille metropolitan
area. The high value of the hospitalization rate would then be more the result of a nonsevere treatment of the infected than of a more active circulation of the virus in the
region, as for the lower hospitalization rates in neighboring districts (0.9 for Var, 0.56
for Vaucluse, 0.52 for Gars, 0.86 for Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, 0.81 for AlpesMaritimes, 0.68 for Hérault). However, patient severity profile (expressed as the ratio
between the number of patients admitted to intensive care and the total number of
patients hospitalized) is not particularly low in the Bouches-Du-Rhône (0.163 for a
mean of 0.156 and a standard deviation of 0.06 for all the districts), and this
hospitalization policy is therefore not proven to be the primary factor in the low
observed case-fatality rate.
Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally
and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe
patients during the epidemic. This decrease stabilized rapidly and no longer evolved
in a steady manner. However, this result is limited by the difficulty of calculating a casefatality rate on aggregated data over a short period of time, with eventual death

occurring several days after hospitalization. We chose to delay the calculation of the
number of deaths by 12 days compared to the calculation of the number of
hospitalizations, since 85% of deaths occur on an average of 13 days after
hospitalization [SAL 20].
WHO data from 219 countries (WHO 20) show a mean case-fatality rate of 0.041
(median 0.029, standard deviation 0.045) with values between 0.31 (Nicaragua) and
0.00 (for countries that did not report deaths, like Vietnam). A T-test shows that the
French average is therefore very significantly higher than the world average (p-value
< 10-6). Even if we consider only the average case-fatality rate calculated only for the
French districts with the lowest hospitalization rates (thus not causing saturation of the
health care system), this average is still very significantly higher than the international
average (and the rates of most European countries, such as Spain, 11.73, Greece,
5.52, Germany, 4.28, etc.) (table 4). Taking into account the quality of the healthcare
system in France (table 1), it can be concluded that the difference between the casefatality rate calculated for France and the case-fatality rates presented using
international WHO data is highly probably the result of a difference in the registration
of cases and/or deaths and not due to the quality of health care. These differences in
the counting of cases and/or deaths may be due to the hospitalization and screening
policy specific to each country as well as the ability or willingness to hospitalize more
non-severe forms, to the differences in case definition, or to insufficient quality of the
system for detecting and reporting cases and deaths.

Conclusion
This study shows that the higher case-fatality rates observed in France in some
districts during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic (data from 19 March to 8 May
2020) are mostly linked to the level of morbidity in the district, and therefore likely to
the congestion of the healthcare systems during the acute phases of the epidemic.
When the hospitalization rate is low, high case-fatality rates concern rural districts with
low population density and could be linked to healthcare access in these districts.
However, the increase in the standardized case-fatality rate due to exceptional
situations during epidemic peaks represents less than 10% of the average case-fatality
rate per district in France, and the hospital case-fatality rate without these districts
would be reduced from 0.151 to 0.138. This increase cannot therefore explain the
extent of the difference observed between the average case-fatality rate in France and
the average of the rates reported for all countries by international organizations or
information sites (WHO, Wordometer, etc.). These differences probably stem from the
reporting of cases and deaths, which is uneven from one country to another, and not
from the care or treatment of patients during hospital stress due to epidemic peaks.
