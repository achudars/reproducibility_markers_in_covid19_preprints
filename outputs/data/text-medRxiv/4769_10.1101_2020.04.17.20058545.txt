Background
SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of an ongoing pandemic with a projected 100,000 to 240,000 U.S.

deaths. To date, documentation of histopathologic features in fatal cases of COVID-19 has been

limited due to small sample size and incomplete organ sampling.

Methods
Post-mortem examinations were performed on 12 fatal COVID-19 cases in Washington State

during February-March 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. Tissue examination of

all major organs was performed by light microscopy and electron microscopy. The presence of

viral RNA in sampled tissues was tested by RT-PCR.

Results
All 12 patients were older with significant preexisting comorbidities. The major pulmonary

finding was diffuse alveolar damage in the acute and/or organizing phases with virus identified

in type I and II pneumocytes by electron microscopy. The kidney demonstrated viral particles in

the tubular epithelium, endothelium, and podocytes without significant inflammation. Viral

particles were also observed in the trachea and large intestines. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected

in the cardiac tissue of a patient with lymphocytic myocarditis. RT-PCR also detected viral RNA

in the subcarinal lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and large intestines.

Conclusion

SARS-CoV-2 represents the third novel coronavirus to cause widespread human disease since

2002. Similar to SARS and MERS, the primary pathology was diffuse alveolar damage with virus

located in the pneumocytes. However, other major organs including the heart and kidneys may

be susceptible to viral replication and damage leading to increased mortality in those with

disseminated disease. Understanding the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 will be essential to design

effective therapies.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified in Wuhan, China from a

cluster of severe pneumonia cases.(1) The virus and the disease it causes (COVID-19) have now

spread globally and are responsible for the first pandemic since the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.

During the four months following its emergence, the community of healthcare workers and

researchers have acted quickly to sequence the virus, establish transmission chains, elucidate

the receptor, and test therapeutics.(2)(3)

These efforts have revealed similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and the related virus, SARS-CoV.

Both have similar clinical presentations with the highest viral load identified in lower respiratory

samples.(4) SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected from stool and blood samples prompting

concerns for multiorgan involvement which would mimic observations in SARS.(5) The viruses

also share a common cellular entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).(3) In

contrast, SARS-CoV was responsible for a limited disease outbreak with high mortality whereas

SARS-CoV-2 has caused a greater number of infections with relatively lower mortality.(6)

Despite early successes in characterizing the virus, reports on the histopathologic

manifestations and tissue tropism of fatal COVID-19 cases remain sparse.(7,8) This absence of

information reflects the acute and overwhelming number of cases straining medical systems

globally. Accurate documentation of the pathobiology in fatal COVID-19 infections may have

implications on patient management and antiviral development. Differences noted between

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may suggest novel mechanisms to target.

Available histopathologic studies have demonstrated pulmonary and gastrointestinal

involvement by SARS-CoV-2 but are limited by small case numbers or limited sampling

adequacy.(7–9) This study addresses those shortcomings by documenting a series of 12 fatal

COVID-19 cases which occurred in Washington State during February-March 2020. Systematic

histopathologic evaluation of all major organs was performed by a combination of light

microscopy, electron microscopy, and molecular detection.

Methods:
Patient Selection and Autopsy Procedure:
IRB approval for this study was waived by the University of Washington. Patients with a positive

antemortem or post-mortem SARS-CoV-2 result were considered eligible for enrollment.

Preliminary testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the Washington State Department of

Health (WSDOH) Public Health laboratory. Confirmatory testing was done by the Centers of

Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. Both locations used the CDC-designed 2019 nCoV

real time RT-PCR assay for viral detection.(10) Autopsies were performed at the King County

Medical Examiner’s Office and Snohomish County Medical Examiner’s Office in negative-

pressure isolation suites. Given safety concerns, an in-situ dissection was performed for seven

cases. The remaining five were examined by standard autopsy procedure. In one case fresh

tissue was collected for electron microscopy RT-PCR studies.

Histologic Examination:

Autopsy material was fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and submitted for standard

processing with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Evaluation of H&E sections was

performed by consensus agreement of four board-certified forensic pathologists (N.Y., T.W.,

J.M.L, D.M.) with expert guidance provided in cardiothoracic pathology (H.X.) and renal

pathology (B.N.).

Ultrastructural Examination
Samples were placed in 1/2 strength Karnovsky fixative. Tissue was then post fixed in 1%

osmium tetroxide, processed following standard transmission electron microscopy procedures

and embedded in PolyBed 812. Suitable sections were identified by toluidine blue staining.

Thin sections were examined using a Tecnai G2 Spirit Bio-Twin transmission electron

microscope and digital images and measurements were acquired using the AMT image capture

software.

Molecular Detection of Viral RNA in Tissue
RNA was extracted from 0.5 µg of tissue using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo

Research, Irvine, CA, USA). The CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus Real-time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel

assay was adapted to a two-step procedure using the 2019 nCoV N1 and N2 primer/probe sets

(IDT, Coralville, Iowa, USA).(10). Complementary DNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA

kit (Bio-Rad). Samples were tested twice in duplicate using iTAq Universal Probes Supermix

(BioRad). Ct values less than 40 were considered positive.

Results
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics
The average age of our cohort was 70.4 years (range 42 to 84 years old). Seven members of the

cohort were part of a single cluster from a long-term care facility.(11) All patients had

significant comorbidities, with the most common being hypertension, chronic kidney disease,

obstructive sleep apnea, and metabolic disease including diabetes and obesity (Tables 1 and

S1).

The most frequent presenting symptoms were respiratory distress (83.3%), fever (58.3%), and

cough (50%). Less commonly encountered initial symptoms included altered mental status and

gastrointestinal distress. During the course of hospital admission, five patients experienced

acute kidney injury demonstrated by elevated creatinine and two patients developed elevated

troponins. Clinically documented pulmonary co-infections were observed in two patients. One

case had Influenza A and methicillin-sensitive

cultures positive with

Staphylococcus aureus; the other had sputum

Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Excluding those who declined resuscitative

measures, all patients were intubated. The median time from symptom onset to intubation was

4.6 days with most intubations occurring at the time of admission. Mortality following

symptom onset varied from 1 to 14 days with a median time of 7 days. Demographics and

patient characteristics are described in Table 1.

Gross Autopsy Examination

All decedents examined by standard autopsy had heavy, edematous lungs which averaged 1049

grams for the right lung and 755 grams for the left lung. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage was

appreciated in one case. There was no evidence of pulmonary consolidation. The volume of

pleural fluid was highly variable and ranged from 0-450 mL per pleural space. Two cases had

evidence of sub-segmental pulmonary emboli.

One case demonstrated mild splenomegaly (350gm). Scattered punctate subarachnoid

hemorrhages were observed in one brain. Additional gross findings demonstrated non-specific

chronic changes including hepatic sinusoidal congestion (100%), hypertensive renal surface

changes (80%), and varying degrees of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (60%).

Histologic Examination
In all cases, sections of lung demonstrated enlarged, reactive type II pneumocytes with

nucleomegaly and prominent nucleoli. Changes of acute and/or organizing diffuse alveolar

damage (DAD) were present in 75% of cases as evidenced by the presence of intra-alveolar

fibrin, hyaline membranes, and loosely organizing connective tissue in the alveolar septal walls

(Figure 1). Half of the cases showed focal areas of acute bronchiolitis with an additional two

cases showing bronchopneumonia. Multinuclear cells were seen in a subset of cases. In at least

one case, small basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions and larger eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions

were identified (Figure 1 and S1). No microthrombi were identified in the pulmonary system.

Proximal and distal tracheal sections displayed mild to moderate edema; acute tracheitis was

rarely observed. (Figure S2) The majority of cardiac findings were associated with prior injury or

hypertensive changes; however, one case contained foci of lymphocytic inflammation

associated with acute myocyte necrosis, consistent with lymphocytic myocarditis. Three cases

showed evidence of splenic white pulp depletion. (Figure 1)

The kidneys showed chronic changes consistent with arterionephrosclerosis. One autopsy

showed prominent proximal tubular epithelial cell vacuolization consistent with acute tubular

injury. Autolysis precluded evaluation for acute tubular injury in other autopsies. Pathologic

findings in the liver demonstrated chronic changes associated with pre-existing comorbidities.

(Figure S2) Liver inflammation was not prominent, although some patients displayed mild

periportal lymphocytic inflammation. Samples of thyroid, pituitary, adrenals, and pancreas

were largely unremarkable. Post-mortem autolysis prevented a thorough investigation of the

gastrointestinal system. Table 2 provides an overview of relevant histopathologic observations.

Electron Microscopy Findings
Electron micrographs demonstrate uniform, round viral particles ranging in size from ~70-100

nm in the lung, trachea, kidney, and large intestines (Figure 2). Definitive viral particles were

not observed in the other organs examined. The particles were found both individually or in

aggregates in the cytoplasm or inside vesicles. In certain planes of section, the lipid membrane

and the peripheral spikes (~15 nm) were more clearly observed (Figure 2). Viral particles were

present in both type I and type II pneumocytes. Type II pneumocytes showed numerous

autophagosomes, characterized by double membranes and presence of organelles, in the

cytoplasm. Some of these autophagosomes contained viral aggregates. No conclusive

aggregates of nucleoprotein or viral inclusions were observed. Viral particles were also present

in tracheal epithelial cells and within the extracellular mucus in the tracheal lumen. Within the

kidney, viral particles localized to tubular epithelium, most prominently in the proximal tubules,

and endothelial cells. Rare vesicle bound viral aggregates were also observed in the podocytes.

Viral RNA Detection
Detectable levels of viral RNA were identified in multiple organs, most predominately the lungs

(Table 3). Ct values ranged from 21 to 30 in respiratory tissues. Less abundant viral RNA was

noted in the subcarinal lymph nodes (Ct=36). Other large organs including the kidney, heart,

liver, spleen, and large intestines had RNA signals at Ct values greater than > 37. Viral RNA was

not detected in the brain, bladder, esophagus, or stomach.

Discussion
Few reports have examined the histopathologic changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection

and none have performed complete evaluation of all major organs.(7–9) Here, we present the

largest summary of autopsy findings in patients who died following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our

results demonstrate the central role of lung damage in cases of terminal COVID-19 and we

propose a mechanism for the extra-pulmonary spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Our cohort of patients exhibited similar comorbidities to those found in hospitalized COVID-19

patients described in other studies.(12) The most common conditions were cardiac disease,

hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea. Patients with these conditions are often

treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II type-1 receptor

blockers. However, treatment with these therapies leads to upregulation of the ACE2 receptor

which also serves as the cellular receptor for viral entry.(13) This observation has led to the

hypothesis that upregulation of ACE2 may contribute to the high mortality rate in these

patients.(14) Only two patients in our cohort had documented prescriptions for ACEi. ACE2 is

expressed across a range of cell types and provides context to our observation of the virus in

multiple different organ systems.(15)

The majority of the decedents presented with cough, shortness of breath, and fever which is

similar to what has been described in other patients worldwide.(12) Upper respiratory

symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and congestion were not common and highlights the

predilection of SARS-CoV-2 for the lower respiratory tract as supported by our electron

microscopy and PCR findings.

The most significant pathological findings in our cohort of fatal COVID-19 cases involved the

pulmonary system. The majority of patients demonstrated pulmonary edema, pronounced

reactive type II pneumocytes, intraalveolar fibrin, and hyaline membranes consistent with DAD.

These findings are similar to those described during the 2002-2003 SARS (SARS-CoV) outbreak

and more recent COVID-19 autopsies.(8,16,17) In contrast to SARS, multinucleated giant cells

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20058545; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

were seen in a minority of our cases.(17) We observed one case with cytoplasmic inclusions in

the pneumocytes. The etiology of these inclusions in SARS-CoV-2 may be explained by in vitro

ultrastructural studies of SARS-CoV where nucleoprotein aggregates were identified in the

cytosol.(18)

Interestingly, the organizing phase of DAD was observed in patients with a brief symptom

onset-to-death interval, which is in contrast to SARS where it was predominantly observed in

those with longer hospitalizations.(19) As suggested by abnormal pulmonary CT scan findings in

asymptomatic patients, the early changes of DAD may occur during the sub-clinical phase with

symptom onset occurring in the organizing phase of damage.(20)

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, secondary bacterial pneumonia complicated approximately

25% of cases and was a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. (21) In our cohort, four

patients had clinically documented secondary bacterial infection or histologic evidence of

bronchopneumonia. This rate is much higher than what has been documented in other studies

of patients admitted to the ICU.(22) Secondary bacterial infections may serve as a negative

prognostic indicator for hospitalized patients.

Electron micrographic studies demonstrated infection of type I and type II pneumocytes by

virus, which recapitulates findings documented in SARS-CoV.(16) We did not observe definitive

involvement of alveolar macrophages, though this may be the result of limited sample size and

post-mortem degeneration.(23) We also observed the induction of double-membrane vesicles

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20058545; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

within infected pneumocytes, consistent with autophagosomes. Studies of the SARS-CoV

replication pathway raised the hypothesis that these double-membrane vesicles served to

shield the virus from host immune detection.(24)

Our RNA data and electron microscopy images suggest the infectious burden of SARS-CoV-2

centers in the lower respiratory tree, specifically the alveolar epithelium. Sites higher in the

respiratory tree had virus detected but at a lower relative concentration compared to alveolar

tissue. These findings could represent contamination by alveolar secretions or decreased

susceptibility of the upper airway to viral infection. We favor the latter interpretation as

ISH/IHC studies of SARS patients demonstrated reduced, but detectable SARS-CoV in the

bronchioles.(25) Moreover, it is likely that high expression of ACE2 in type II pneumocytes

makes these cells more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.(26,27)

Detection of moderate levels of viral RNA in the sub-carinal lymph node suggests leukocytes

may serve as a route for the virus to disseminate from the alveoli to other organs. While

fulminant infection of other organs may not occur, given the pre-existing comorbidities in our

patient population, we hypothesize that even a low level of virally-induced cytotoxicity could

prompt organ dysfunction. Infection of leukocytes also raises the question as to the degree

which SARS-CoV-2 infection modulates the immune response and contributes to cytokine

dysregulation. This hypothesis is in keeping with the pathologic mechanism postulated for

SARS.(28)

Our understanding of the cardiac effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection are rapidly evolving. In a study

documenting the clinical course of ICU patients in Kirkland, Washington, it was found that 33%

of patients experienced cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology.(29) Similarly, myocardial injury

with elevated troponins was identified in 22% of ICU patients.(12) While the majority of our

patient cohort had no clinical concern for cardiomyopathy, one case from a patient with

elevated troponins demonstrated lymphocytic myocarditis with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

The kidneys demonstrated variable chronic changes such as arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic

nephropathy in keeping with the poor renal function of our cohort. No specific viral cytopathic

changes or increased inflammation were identified by light microscopy. However, by electron

microscopy, we identified abundant viral particles in proximal tubules, relatively fewer in the

endothelial cells, and rare particles in the podocytes. High expression of ACE2 has recently been

confirmed in proximal tubular epithelial cells.(26,27) The lack of inflammation in the kidneys

contrasts with our pulmonary findings and raises the possibility of organ-specific viral responses

and patterns of damage. Our findings have implications for transplant surgeries, as a negative

nasopharyngeal swab may not exclude virus in other organs. These findings also highlight the

peculiarity that virus has not been identified in the urine.(5)

Hepatic findings in our case series are similar to prior reports, however it is unclear if these

changes are due to COVID-19 or a combination of background metabolic disease and general

shock physiology.(9) The spleens in our cohort were largely unremarkable with a subset

demonstrating white pulp depletion and one case of splenomegaly. Splenic white pulp

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20058545; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

depletion was also observed in SARS-CoV infections, but was associated with decreased spleen

weight.(16) Virus observed in the lumen of the bowel is in keeping with studies demonstrating

shedding in the stool.(30)

We acknowledge the inconsistency between our tissue PCR data and EM images for certain

organs. In particular, abundant viral particles were observed in the kidney, however, only a

weak RNA signal was detected. A potential explanation for this result may be due to sampling

bias if virus distribution is patchy. Another cause for the low PCR signal (Ct > 37) detected

across multiple organs could be related to post-mortem tissue autolysis and RNA degradation.

Application of more sensitive technologies such as high-throughput sequencing or in situ

hybridization will improve our ability to detect small fragments of RNA.

Our findings demonstrate the central role of the lower respiratory tree as the likely nidus from

which virus disseminates to other organs. We found broad tropism for SARS-CoV-2 with virus

identified in the kidneys, heart, large intestines, spleen, and liver. Accurate and comprehensive

studies of the histopathologic manifestations of COVID-19 will guide clinicians and researchers

towards reducing mortality with timely clinical and therapeutic interventions.
