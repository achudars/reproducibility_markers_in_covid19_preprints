Abstract
Remaining a major healthcare concern with nearly 29 million confirmed cases
worldwide at the time of writing, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 920 thousand deaths since its
outbreak in China, December 2019. First case of a person testing positive for SARSCoV-2 infection within the territory of the Republic of Latvia was registered on 2 nd of
March 2020, nine days prior to the pandemic declaration by WHO. Since then, more
than 277 000 tests were carried out confirming a total of 1464 cases of COVID-19 in
the country as of 12th of September 2020. Rapidly reacting to the spread of the
infection, an ongoing sequencing campaign was started mid-March in collaboration
with the local testing laboratories, with an ultimate goal in sequencing as much local
viral isolates as possible, resulting in first full-length SARS-CoV-2 isolate genome
sequences from the Baltics region being made publicly available in early April. With
133 viral isolates representing ~9.1% of the total COVID-19 cases in the country being
completely sequenced as of today, here we provide a first report on the genetic
diversity of Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

Introduction
Current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was formerly known as 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and is often referred to as Human coronavirus 2019
(hCoV-19), responsible for a sudden rise in pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, late
December 2019, was preventively deemed a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern by WHO as early as 30th January, 2020 with only as few as 7836 cases
confirmed worldwide back then. With rapidly growing number of confirmed positive
cases throughout the world, SARS-CoV-2 quickly became arguably the most
sequenced virus in history with more than 100 thousands (2020-09-14) viral isolate
near complete genome sequences of high quality available publicly at the time of
writing at GISAID repository thanks to the unprecedented rate of collaborations
between researchers and unpublished data sharing with the goal of effectively
tackling the novel disease [1,2].
Genome of SARS-CoV-2
First reported genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was deduced from a metagenomic
RNA of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen sampled from a patient who worked at
Wuhan seafood market, where the epidemiological onset of human-to-human
transmission of a novel zoonotic coronavirus is thought to have taken place [3],
although evidence of an earlier contraction of the disease that was not associated with
the seafood market has been documented, leading to the conclusion that the primary
spill-over event has taken place elsewhere[4,5]. The sequence of a 29903 base long
non-segmented positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule representing complete
genome of the aforementioned isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was deposited in GenBank [6] on
5th of January, 2020 and is now known as a SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence available
under accession numbers NC_045512.2 or MN908947.3.
While viral family Coronaviridae, that comprises α/β/Δ/γ coronavirus genera,
representatives are somewhat unique in comparison with most other RNA viruses in
regards to their large genome size of ~30 kb, genomic organization of individual
species does not differ much among other lower taxa within the family, while boasting
variable number of open reading frames. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 begins with a
265 base long 5’ UTR region starting with a leader sequence followed by a 21 290 base
long ORF1ab, comprising about 70% of the genome length, that translates into two
polyproteins via -1 ribosomal frameshift and encodes 16 non-structural proteins
(nsp1-nsp16). The remaining part of the genome comprises ORFs coding for structural
and accessory proteins of unknown function, sequentially: Spike glycoprotein (S),
ORF3a, envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b,
ORF8, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), ORF10, followed by 3’ UTR ending in poly(A)
tail. However, no evidence that would support the expression of SARS-CoV-2 ORF10
encoded protein of unknown function is yet found in the literature [7].
Possible origins of SARS-CoV-2
SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh zoonotic human coronavirus known up to date, and, along
with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, is considered to be highly pathogenic and more severe

compared to other, milder symptoms causing, community-acquired human
coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) [8].
Studies on the origin of novel coronavirus have revealed that complete genomic
sequence of SARS-CoV-2 suggests a more close, although not a direct parental,
ancestral relationship with bat (~96% overall nucleotide homology with RaTG13[9])
and pangolin coronaviruses (up to ~92% homology, with S protein ACE2 receptor
binding domain amino acid sequence being 97.4% identical to SARS-CoV-2 [10]), than
to those of humans(~79% and ~50% identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively
[11], and, while bats are already a long-time acknowledged reservoir of SARS-CoV-like
β-coronaviruses [12,13], the assumption that pangolins can serve as a natural host for
CoVs has been made only recently before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 [14,15].
Although the current risk of animal-human transmission of COVID-19 is considered
low, a number of felines[16], canines[17] and minks[18] worldwide have been
reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 isolate classification
With a steadily growing number of complete hCoV-19 genome sequences, early
efforts to classify novel isolates based on their genetic make-up have resulted in
numerous proposals of different SARS-CoV-2 isolate classification systems [19][20]
[21], some of which (e.g. PANGOLIN lineages) are complementary. However, with
more than 100 000 of hCoV-19 genome sequences being available publicly as of now,
ongoing efforts to aid in the classification of newly sequenced viral isolates have
resulted in the general acceptance of GISAID’s team developed SARS-CoV-2 major
clade and lineage nomenclature system based on the specific combinations of 9 hCoV19 genetic markers [1]. In accordance with this system, hCoV-19 isolates can be
classified in at least six distinct major clades, namely: S, L (containing reference
sequence Wuhan-Hu-1), V, G, GH, GR and O (other) isolate clades (Table 1).

Table 1. Major hCoV-19 clades defining genetic markers and their occurrence in Latvia, Europe and
Worldwide (as of 2020-09-14). X denotes any nucleotide.

Mid-September, 2020, the most represented clades Worldwide are GR, G and GH,
roughly corresponding to 34.92%, 22.59% and 22.14% of total hCoV-19 isolates,
respectively. All three of these clades are characterized by C241T base substitution in
5’ UTR region, C3037T silent mutation in ORF1a and missense A23403G mutation that
causes Aspartic acid at position 614 of spike glycoprotein (S) to change to Glycine (SD614G), that is associated with higher viral loads and, in turn, is hypothesized to
increase the infectivity of these genotypes, with isolates bearing this mutation quickly

becoming dominant ones in various regions throughout the world [22–24]. More
recent clades GR and GH are further distinguished from the ancestral G genotype by
G25563T mutation resulting in position 57 of ORF3a protein to change from glutamine
to histidine for clade GH, and G28882A that changes glycine at nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein (N) aa position 204 to arginine for clade GR. While the exact effect of
GH clade-defining G25563T change in apoptosis-inducing transmembrane ORF3a
protein (Q57R) remains unknown, it does not seem to affect any of the conserved
functional domains distinguishable within the protein [25,26]. Whereas, G28882A
mutation associated with GR genotype is almost always a trinucleotide mutation of
neighboring loci resulting in GGG to AAC change at positions 28881, 28882 and 28883,
respectively. This trinucleotide mutation results in two (R203K and G204R)
consecutive amino acid changes in N protein, which, in turn, might have potential
implications on nucleocapsid phosphoprotein structure and/or function via reduction
of conformational entropy and changes in inter-residue interactions in the proximity
of the mutated amino acid positions (elaborated on in [27]). The currently estimated
mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is around 9.86 x 10−4 to 1.85 x 10−4 substitutions per
position per year [28], and, based on the isolates sequenced worldwide up to date,
there is evidence that mutations in nearly every position in the genome of SARS-CoV2 have already been documented [29].
In this study, we are reporting the first results of an ongoing massive sequencing
campaign that allows us to elaborate on the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates
from Latvian patients.

Materials and Methods
Sample management and detection of SARS-CoV-2
For viral genome analysis either oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs obtained
from COVID-19 patients or already extracted RNA samples were provided to Latvian
Biomedical Research and Study Centre by the three accredited diagnostic laboratories
(E. Gulbis Laboratory, Central Laboratory and Latvian Centre of Infectious Diseases)
covering diagnostics of all officially reported cases of SARS-CoV-2. RNA extraction from
oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs and the following SARS-CoV-2 detection
was performed by multiple different methods according to standard procedures of
each laboratory. These included manual Trizol-based RNA extraction (TRI reagent,
Sigma) and automated purification methods with STARMag 96 X 4 Universal Cartridge
Kit (Seegene Inc.), NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMérieux), QIAamp 96 Virus QIAcube HT Kit
(QIAGEN). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the purified RNA samples was estimated by,
either commercial or in-house RT-QPCR (Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay, Seegene Inc)
methods. Samples showing amplification (ct < 40) of at least one viral gene (RdRp, E,
N) were considered as positive and directed to next-generation sequencing.
Next-generation sequencing
Metatranscriptome sequencing was the first-choice method for the SARS-CoV-2
genome analysis. Nevertheless, since the majority of samples showed an insufficient
number of sequencing reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome and could not be
reliably analyzed, targeted sequencing approaches were considered. A

methodological strategy plan was developed in order to apply the most effective nextgeneration sequencing method for each sample according to the quantity of SARSCoV-2 (Supplementary figure 1). At first, RT-QPCR was repeated for each sample in
order to evaluate the quantity of viral RNA with a common approach for all samples.
Three SARS-CoV-2 genome-specific primer pairs and probes targeting different
regions of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene implemented in the 2019-nCoV RUO Kit
(IDT), and SOLIScript® 1-step CoV Kit (Solis Biodyne) were used for the amplification.
Probes N1 and N2 specifically detected SARS-CoV-2, while the N3 probe universally
detected all currently recognized clade 2 and 3 viruses within the subgenus
Sarbecovirus [30]. To evaluate the RNA extraction and PCR efficiency, simultaneous
amplification of the human RNase P gene was performed and a control sample
containing a plasmid with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoplasmid protein gene (2019nCoV_N_Positive Control, IDT) was added to each reaction set. The potential
contamination was evaluated by a negative control (nuclease-free water instead of
RNA) added to each sample set. RT-QPCR was conducted on the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR
System (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and only the samples showing amplification (ct <
40) of all three SARS-CoV-2 nucleoplasmid protein genes were further directed to
metatranscriptome sequencing. Samples exhibiting poor amplification of viral genes
(ct > 40 for at least one target region) were considered for one of targeted sequencing
approaches: hybridization capture or amplification of SARS-CoV-2.
Metatranscriptome sequencing
In order to eliminate contaminating DNA, DNase I treatment (NEB) of RNA samples
was performed, followed by rRNA depletion with MGIEasy rRNA Depletion Kit (MGI
Tech Co. Ltd). Complementary DNA libraries were prepared using MGIEasy RNA
Library Prep Set (MGI Tech Co. Ltd). Quantity and quality of both RNA and cDNA were
evaluated using the Qubit 2.0 fluorometer and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system,
respectively. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was repeatedly tested in each
cDNA library by Q-PCR before sequencing, using the same primers and probes (2019nCoV_N_Positive Control, IDT) together with TaqMan™ Gene Expression Master Mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). After multiple experimental tests, a ct value threshold of
25 was chosen for N1 and N3 probes for cDNA libraries to be forwarded to
metatranscriptome sequencing (N2 probe appeared to be unstable and therefore
uninformative). Metatranscriptome cDNA libraries were sequenced on the DNBSEQG400RS sequencing platform with DNBSEQ-G400RS High-throughput Sequencing Set
(PE150) (MGI Tech Co. Ltd), obtaining at least 100 million 150-bp-paired-end
sequencing reads per each sample. Those libraries that failed to pass the ct threshold
(ct > 25 for N1 and N3) were directed to a targeted approach.
SARS-CoV-2 hybridization capture
One of the targeted sequencing strategies was based on the enrichment of the SARSCoV-2 genome by hybridization probes. For cDNA library preparation TruSeq Stranded
Total RNA Library Prep Gold kit and TruSeq RNA UD Indexes (Illumina) were used. The
indexed cDNA libraries were enriched for the SARS-CoV-2 genome using compatible
hybridization probes implemented in the myBaits Expert SARS-CoV-2 kit (Arbor
Biosciences) according to manufacturers instructions. The enriched libraries were

sequenced on Illumina MiSeq system with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (150-cycle), obtaining
at least 1 million of around 75-bp-paired-end reads per sample.
Amplification of SARS-CoV-2 genome
The second targeted approach involved multiplexed primers for amplification of the
whole SARS-CoV-2 genome. QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel (QIAGEN) [31] was used
together with QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (QIAGEN) for cDNA library preparation. Nextgeneration sequencing was performed on Illumina MiSeq system with MiSeq Reagent
Kit v2 (300-cycles), obtaining at least 1 million of around 150bp paired-end reads per
sample.
Sequencing data quality control, variant calling and data sharing
Adapter clipping was performed with cutadapt 1.16 [32]. Subsequent read trimming
was performed with fastp 0.20.0 [33] using 5 base sliding window trimming from both
ends with quality threshold 20. Reads with length less than 75 bp or an average quality
of less than 20 were removed. Quality controlled reads were then aligned against
SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (Accession number:
NC_045512.2) with bowtie2 2.3.5.1 [34]. Variant calling and consensus sequence
construction were implemented using bcftools 1.10.2 [35]. Average coverage for each
of the genomes was calculated using samtools and in-house awk [36] scripts. Less than
1% of the missing bases were allowed for a genome to be considered successfully
sequenced and missing bases were treated as reference bases from the Wuhan-Hu-1
genome. Consensus sequences of the successfully sequenced isolates were then
proceeded to the manual variant quality inspection by sequence alignment map
visualization in IGV [37], sequences that have passed the manual variant quality check
were immediately publicly shared by deposition to GISAID database [1]. Variant
annotations were performed using coronapp SARS-CoV-2 genome autoannotation
web server by comparisons to reference sequence [38] and the results were
summarized with the help of custom R scripts, ggplot2 R library was used for plot
visualizations [39][40].
Phylogenetic reconstructions
Sequences of the Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence
were aligned using Clustal-Omega v 1.2.4. [41]. Maximum likelihood phylogeny was
performed using IQTREE v 2.0.6 [42] with GTR+F+I as best fit model determined by
ModelFinder [43] according to Bayesian Information Criterion (ultrafast bootstrap
with 1000 replicates [44]) and assessment of temporal signal associated with the data
was performed by importing resulting ML tree into TempEst v1.5.3 [45], parsing
sampling dates of isolates and visualizing the root-to-tip divergence.
Bayesian phylogenetic trees were estimated using BEAST v1.10.4 [46], employing GTR
nucleotide substitution model with empirical base frequencies and invariant site
proportion assuming strict molecular clock. Coalescent exponential growth prior
(growth rate prior: Laplace with scale 100; population size prior: Lognormal with mu
1 and sigma 2) with growth rate parametrization [47,48] was selected and Markov

chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run for 50 million states sampling log parameters and
trees every 5 000 states. Tracer v 1.7.1 [49] was used for MCMC trace (log file)
inspection to evaluate sufficiency of sampling (all parameters had an ESS of more than
400) and infer substitution rate along with the date of the most recent common
ancestor estimate. To summarize Bayesian phylogenetic inference, maximum clade
credibility time-scaled tree was generated in TreeAnnotator v 1.10.4 (distributed with
BEAST package) using 10% of the states (5 million) as the burn-in and visualized using
FigTree v 1.4.4 [50].

Results and discussion
With 1464 cumulative positive cases as of 12th of September 2020 (1248 people
recovered, 181 active cases of the disease and 35 COVID-19 associated deaths), 133
hCoV-19 isolates representing ~9.1% of the total local COVID-19 cases have been
completely sequenced as of today, making Latvia one of the leading countries not only
in regards to the containment of the spread of COVID-19 disease, but in the number
of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates to the cumulative number of positive COVID-19
cases ratio as well (Figure 1).

Reacting to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 in Latvia, a high-throughput framework
for SARS-CoV-2 isolate sequencing and data analysis with capabilities of near real-time
tracking of the epidemiological situation in Latvia was built to aid the governmental
decision-making and study the molecular epidemiology of hCoV19.
One of the challenges to obtain good quality sequences for maximal number of
samples is the variable quality of input material that can be caused by highly variable
viral loads, different collection, storage and RNA isolation methods. Although for the
current study we did not have the information on the severity of COVID-19 symptoms
for particular cases, it should be noted that the absolute majority of cases in Latvia are
with low symptom severity expected to have lower concentration of virus in diagnostic
samples. We therefore developed an approach to verify sample quality and select
appropriate sequencing method to recover maximal available information from

existing samples ensuring cost efficacy of the process (Figure S1). According to this
strategy developed during the implementation of the study, complete SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence was successfully obtained by metatranscriptome approach for 37
viral isolates, 80 samples were analyzed by amplification of SARS-CoV-2 genome with
multiplexed primers, and for 16 isolates enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 genome was
performed by hybridization capture method prior the sequencing.
As of now it could be cautiously speculated that the obtained results on the SARS-CoV2 genotype distributions might be somewhat representative of a whole Baltics region,
taking the geographical proximity, travel habits and mild governmental travel
regulations between the Baltic states during the most of the pandemic into the
account. However, the extent of similarity between the isolates circulating in different
Baltic states currently cannot be reliably established due to SARS-CoV-2 isolate
undersequencing in neigboring Estonia and Lithuania, and the founder effect of
multiple independent (re-)introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, as well as
containment effectivity of respective COVID19 cases, in each of the countries should
not be overlooked.
Distribution of sequenced virus isolates by SARS-CoV-2 clades
Major isolate clade distributions across distinct geographical regions show clear
spatial differences of the epidemic (Figure 2) and a trend of “older” isolate clades L
and S losing their initial prevalence to the dominance of the more recently-emerged
G-associated clades (G, GH, GR) that seem to be accountable for the majority of the
cases worldwide since the middle of March 2020. GR, which is the most common
isolate clade in Latvia (48.12% of cases), is also a dominant clade in Europe and South
America. Currently, GH still seems to be the most common isolate clade circulating
throughout North America, but a rise in the number of GR isolates can be observed
since the middle of May 2020. The prevalence of GR and, in particular, G clade isolates
is also currently on the rise in Africa, and, to a very moderate amount in Oceania and
Asia. The relatively high number of isolates not corresponding to any of the currently
recognized major SARS-CoV-2 clades (dubbed “Other” or belonging to the “O” clade
as of now) in Asia and Oceania makes it possible to speculate about it being indicative
of either (but not mutually exclusive), poor quality of the sequences obtained or the
possibility of novel clade emergence originating from these regions in the future,
should their spread not be effectively contained.

Mutational landscape of Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates
After joining of the neighboring loci, among 133 local isolates, 247 different unique
mutational events (154 nonsynonymous, 84 synonymous, 7 substitutions in extragenic
regions, single deletion and a single stop codon introduction) that affected 244
positions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were registered from a total of 1355 variants that
were identified. 146 out of 247 distinct mutational events were registered only in one
of the 133 samples, while 101 were present in two or more samples (Supplementary
table 1 and supplementary figure 2). NSP3 was found to be the mature peptide most
frequently affected by non-synonymous substitutions (24 distinct variants resulting in
an amino acid change), followed by an N protein that had 15 non-synonymous SNVs
documented among Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Among the most frequently mutated
proteins, NSP2, S and NSP12b mature peptides harbored 13, 12 and 10 different amino
acid altering mutations, respectively.

Based on the current coronapp web-server [38] report updated at 2020-09-15
(n=89978), most frequent mutational events worldwide are: A23403G corresponding
to S:D614G, C3037T silent mutation, C14408T resulting in NSP12b:P314L, C241T
extragenic substitution and GGG28881ACC trinucleotide mutation of neighboring loci
resulting in N:RG203KR, G25563T – ORF3a:Q57H. All six of these mutations were also
among the most frequent mutational events registered in Latvian samples: 5’ UTR
C241T extragenic substitution that was present in 129 out of 133 sequenced genomes,
while C3037T silent (NSP3:F106F) mutation, A23403G (S:D614G) and C14408T
(NSP12b:P314L) were all present in 128/133 samples, GGG28881AAC trinucleotide
mutation (N:RG203KR) was observed almost in 59/133 of the samples, and 28881
position of the genome had two more variants detectable in the samples –
GGGG28881AACT (N:RG203KL) quadranucleotide mutation (32/133) and G28881A
(N:R203K) substitution being present in five of the samples, while G25563T –
ORF3a:Q57H was found in 41 of the isolates. (See figure 3 and supplementary table
1).

Figure 3. Ten most frequently mutated genome positions among Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates (n=133).
X axis is discrete and shows genome position corresponding to one of the ten most frequent mutated
positions (ordered in descending order). Y axis represents mutation occurrence among the samples
(same as numbers within the respective upper boundary of bars) at a given position. Labels in the
middle of bars represent the nucleotide change at a given position and its effect on the respective
protein amino acid sequence. Color coding is based on the variant class and bars are colored according
to the legend. Note: bars representing different mutations of the same locus are stacked (position
28881).

It was noted that five out of six aforementioned mutations (with the exclusion of
C14408T) are in the genome positions serving as markers for current SARS-CoV-2
isolate major clade definition and correspond to GR clade, that is the most

represented clade Worldwide and hosts almost half of the sequenced isolates in Latvia
(Figure 3 and able 1). The C14408T substitution resulting in NSP12b:P314L amino acid
change has been previously reported to co-occur with C241T, C3037T and A23403G
mutations [51], which is consistent with our data, where four of these SNPs were
simultaneously present 127/133 of the Latvian SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced up to
date. While no experimental evidence of C14408T substitution implications on the
NSP12b (RdRp) activity is yet present, isolates bearing this variant were previously
speculated to have more mutations, and elaborations about possible implications of
RdRp mutations on antiviral drug resistance were made [52]. The fitness of G and Gderived strains, as denoted by the recent rise of their prevalence throughout different
regions of the world, is hardly explainable only by the founder effect alone, thus
highlighting the fact that further evidence on molecular and clinical implications of the
most common substitutions in the genomes of currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 is
urgently needed to improve the measures of containment of COVID-19 and develop
effective antiviral therapies and vaccines, that would help to not only combat the
present virus of immediate concern, but also be of vital importance for other
coronaviruses to yet emerge.
Phylogenetic analyses
Root-to-tip regression analysis with the "best-fitting root" and "correlation" function
options resulted in a correlation coefficient of the analysis being estimated at 0.6754
and a determination coefficient (R2) equaling to 0.4562 (Supplementary Figure 3).
Although having some of the sequences that diverged more or less than expected at
their sampling date, the dataset had a moderate association between sequence
divergence and sampling date, implying suitability for phylogenetic molecular clock
analysis.
Following Bayesian phylogenetic inference, mean mutation rate derived from Latvian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates was found to be 7.5185 x 10-4 substitutions per site per year
(6.0256 x 10-4 - 9.1308 x 10-4, 95% highest posterior density interval), roughly
corresponding to an average of 22-23 mutational events in genome per year (95%
HPD: ~18 – ~27), and lies within mutation rate ranges predicted by other researchers.
Based on the analysis, the estimated most recent common ancestor of the isolates has
emerged on 16th of November, 2019 (4th October, 2019 – 27th December, 2019, 95%
interval). Our molecular clock analysis (Fig. 4) further supported the more recent
divergence of G and G-derived (GR and GH) clades with the most recent common
ancestor for three of the aforementioned major clades dating back to 6 th of January,
2020 (95% HPD: 27th November, 2019 – 5th February, 2020) and allowed us to date the
near-simultaneous emergence of TMRCAs for clades GR (8 th of February, 2020; 95%
HPD: 16th January, 2020 – 28th of February, 2020) and GH (10th of February, 2020; 95%
HPD: 17th January, 2020 – 1st March, 2020). The 95% HPD date ranges are consistent
with the collection dates of unambiguously dated genomes belonging to clades GH
and GR deposited at GISAID (accessed 2020-08-14). Earliest reported SARS-CoV-2
genome belonging to clade GH was collected on 2nd of February 2020 in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia (GISAID accession: EPI_ISL_489996), while earliest reported GR clade genome
was collected on 16th of February 2020 in London, England (GISAID accession:
EPI_ISL_466615), however first reported sequences with unambiguous collection date
belonging to GR and GH ancestral clade G were collected on 24 th of January, 2020 in

China, cities of Zhejiang and Chengdu (GISAID accessions: EPI_ISL_422425,
EPI_ISL_451345).
Our phylogenetic analysis of the local isolates suggests multiple unlinked initial
introductions of already divergent SARS-CoV-2 isolates to Latvia. Just two weeks after
the first positive case of COVID-19 was documented in Latvia on the 2nd of March,
isolates representing at least three major SARS-CoV-2 clades (L, GR and GH) were
already circulating within the country corresponding to at least four epidemiologically
unlinked introductions. No isolates belonging to clade L (most similar to the initial
Wuhan-Hu-1 reference) were sequenced after the end of March and local circulation
of clade G representatives was not detectable until the end of August, while clade GH
and, specifically, GR isolates seem to have taken hold of the epidemic without showing
any signs of ceasing their proliferation within the Latvian population, however, recent
reintroduction event possibility should not be ruled out due to cancelation of travel
restrictions and insufficient testing of those entering the country. With nearly half of
the sequenced isolates belonging to the widely represented GR clade, up to this date,
no isolates representing clades V or S were documented among the sequenced Latvian
COVID-19 cases (Figures 2 and 4).

Figure 4. Maximum clade credibility tree (mean node heights) estimated from the completely
sequenced Latvian isolates (n=133) and Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate. Node labels are colored according to the
GISAID major clade of particular isolate, green – GR, yellow – GH, red – G, blue – L, purple – O (other),
black – Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. The tree is timescaled and axis represents time in a decimal
year notation (one months is ~0.08333 of a year and one day is approximately 0.00274 of a year). Nodes
are colored according to their respective posterior probabilities in gradient from blue (lowest value) to
red (highest value). Dated node bars represent 95% highest posterior density intervals and are shown
for the selected nodes.

Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was built to more apparently infer genetic
distances between the samples (Figure 5). Although of satisfactory topology,
supporting major clade clustering, the tree evidently shows the possible discrepancies
between the reported sampling dates and expected sequence divergence (e.g. some
of the samples most divergent from the root are dated with the end of April, while
some of the most recently collected ones are notably less divergent), which is not
attributable to sequencing errors or the possibility of co-infection by two different

“strains”. Identical sequences sampled within a short date range (Figure 5.) might be
strongly indicative of epidemiologically linked transmission, given the relatively small
daily amount of positive COVID-19 cases in Latvia even during the peaks of the disease
spread.

Figure 5. Evolutionary relationships of 133 sequenced Latvian and Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 isolates.
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum-likelihood method allowing for polytomies.
The tree is rooted at Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. The tree is drawn to scale, branch lengths
correspond to nucleotide substitutions. The analysis involved 134 nucleotide sequences (133 Latvian
SARS-CoV-2 isolates and Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence). There were a total of 29903 positions in
the final dataset. Node labels are colored according to the GISAID major clade of particular isolate,
green – GR, yellow – GH, red – G, blue – L, purple – O (other), black – Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence.

While providing interesting insights on the COVID-19 situation in Latvia, which might
be representative of Baltics region to an extent, given the scarce amount of isolate
genomes available from neighboring countries, it, however, should be noted, that the
main drawback for each of the presented analyses is stemming from the available

dataset - discrete early sampling with some of the dates since first positive case not
being sampled at all (Figure 1). Another major drawback is the unavailability of
patient/isolate epidemiological data that could be linked to the respective cases
sequenced (e.g. sequence epidemiological linkage, patient travel history etc.) in the
frame of this study. Inclusion of additional data and retrospective sequencing of a
larger number of cases that would allow for a more in-depth analysis of
epidemiological situation will be performed and published elsewhere.
In conclusion, the high-throughput framework for SARS-CoV-2 isolate sequencing and
data analysis in Latvia has been built by Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre
early on during the start of the pandemic, tested with the help of both, governmental
and local private laboratory sample providers, and proposed as a pivotal tool to
monitor the local outbreaks and aid in decision making. This framework allowed us to
ensure the sequencing of viral isolates from the majority of the new cases starting
from the beginning of July, 2020 with fast date delivery to the Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control in Latvia allowing to link the epidemiological data to the
isolates being sequenced. We believe that this framework is of vital importance for
rapid implementation of the most suitable public health measures, possible
transmission history deduction and viral evolution monitoring for the prevention of
future epidemiological outbreaks.
