ABSTRACT
An outbreak of novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (formerly named 2019-

35

nCoV), began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the COVID-19 disease

36

associated with infection has since spread rapidly to multiple countries. Here we report

37

the development of SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR, a rapid (~30 min), low-cost, and accurate

38

CRISPR-Cas12 based lateral flow assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory

39

swab RNA extracts. We validated this method using contrived reference samples and

40

clinical samples from infected US patients and demonstrated comparable performance

41

to the US CDC SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay.

42
43

Over the past 40 years, there have been recurrent large-scale epidemics from

44

novel emerging viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS and

45

MERS coronaviruses, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, Ebola virus (EBOV), Zika

46

virus (ZIKV), and most recently SARS-CoV-21,2. All of these epidemics presumably

47

resulted from an initial zoonotic animal-to-human transmission event, with either

48

clinically apparent or occult spread into vulnerable human populations. Each time, a

49

lack of rapid, accessible, and accurate molecular diagnostic testing has hindered the

50

public health response to the emerging viral threat.

51

In early January 2020, a cluster of cases of pneumonia from a novel coronavirus,

52

SARS-CoV-2 (with the disease referred to as COVID-19), was reported in Wuhan,

53

China1,2. This outbreak has spread rapidly, with over 90,000 reported cases and 3,000

54

deaths as of March 4th, 20203. Person-to-person transmission from infected individuals

55

with no or mild symptoms has been reported4,5. Assays using quantitative reverse

56

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) approaches for detection of the

57

virus in 4-6 hours have been developed by several laboratories, including an

58

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved assay developed by the US CDC6.

59

However, the typical turnaround time for screening and diagnosing patients with

60

suspected SARS-CoV-2 has been >24 hours given the need to ship samples overnight

61

to reference laboratories. To accelerate clinical diagnostic testing for COVID-19 in the

62

United States, the FDA on February 28th, 2020 permitted individual clinically licensed

63

laboratories to report the results of in-house developed SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays

64

while awaiting results of an EUA submission for approval7.

65

Here we report the development and initial validation of a CRISPR (clustered

66

regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas12 based assay8-11 for detection of

67

SARS-CoV-2 from extracted patient sample RNA in ~30 min, called SARS-CoV-2

68

DETECTR. This assay performs simultaneous reverse transcription and isothermal

69

amplification using loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP)12 from RNA extracted from

70

nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs in universal transport media (UTM), followed

71

by Cas12 detection of predefined coronavirus sequences, after which cleavage of a

72

reporter molecule confirms detection of the virus. We first designed primers targeting

73

the E (envelope) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1a). The primers

74

amplify regions that overlap the WHO assay (E gene region) and US CDC assay (N2

75

region in the N gene)6,13, but are modified to meet design requirements for LAMP. We

76

did not target the N1 and N3 regions used by the US CDC assay, as these regions

77

lacked suitable protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites for the Cas12 guide RNAs

78

(gRNAs). Next, we designed Cas12 gRNAs to detect three SARS-like coronaviruses

79

(SARS-CoV-2 accession NC_045512, bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45,

80

accession MG772933), and SARS-CoV, accession NC_004718)) in the E gene and

81

specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 only in the N gene (Supplementary Fig. 1).

82

Using synthetic, in vitro transcribed (IVT) SARS-CoV-2 RNA gene targets in

83

nuclease-free water, we demonstrated that the CRISPR-Cas12 based detection can

84

distinguish SARS-CoV-2 with no cross-reactivity for related coronavirus strains (Fig. 1b,

85

Supplementary Fig. 2). We then optimized the conditions for the SARS-CoV-2

86

DETECTR assay on the E gene, N gene and the human RNase P gene as a control,

87

which consists of an RT-LAMP reaction at 62°C for 20 min and Cas12 detection

88

reaction at 37°C for 10 min. The DETECTR assay can be run in approximately 30 min

89

and visualized on a lateral flow strip (Fig. 1c, d). The SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR assay

90

requires detection of both the E and N genes to confirm a positive test (Fig. 1e), and

91

interpretation is consistent with that for the CDC assay N1 and N2 genes (the N3 gene

92

target region for the CDC assay is no longer being used due to concerns regarding

93

flaws in manufacturing reagents and potential decreased sensitivity)14.

94

We next compared the analytic limits of detection (LoD) of the RT-LAMP/Cas12

95

DETECTR assay relative to the US FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)-approved

96

CDC assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1; Fig. 2d). A standard curve for

97

quantitation was constructed using 7 dilutions of a control IVT viral nucleoprotein RNA

98

(“CDC VTC nCoV Transcript”)6, with 3 replicates at each dilution (Fig. 2d, left;

99

Extended Data 1). Ten two-fold serial dilutions of the same control nucleoprotein RNA

100

were then used to run the DETECTR assay, with 6 replicates at each dilution (Fig. 2d,

101

right; Supplementary Fig. 3). The estimated LoD for the CDC assay tested by

102

California Department of Public Health was 1 copy/µL reaction, consistent with the

103

analytic performance in the FDA package insert, versus 10 copies/µL reaction for the

104

DETECTR assay.

105

We then assessed the capability of the RT-LAMP assay to amplify SARS-CoV-2

106

nucleic acid directly from raw sample matrix consisting of nasopharyngeal swabs from

107

asymptomatic donors placed in universal transport medium (UTM) or phosphate

108

buffered saline (PBS) and spiked with SARS-CoV-2 IVT target RNA. Assay

109

performance was degraded at reaction concentration of ≥10% UTM and ≥20% PBS by

110

volume, with estimated limits of detection decreasing to 500 and 1,500 copies/µL,

111

respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4).

112

Finally, we tested extracted RNA from 11 respiratory swab samples collected

113

from 6 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients (COVID19-1A/B to COVID19-5A/B, where

114

A=nasopharyngeal swab and B=oropharyngeal swab and COVID19-6, a single

115

nasopharyngeal swab) and 12 nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with

116

influenza (n=4), common human seasonal coronavirus infections (n=3, representing

117

OC43, HKU1, NL63), and healthy donors (n=5) (Fig. 2e, f; Supplementary Fig. 5).

118

Relative to the CDC qRT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR was 90% sensitive and 100%

119

specific for detection of the coronavirus in respiratory swab samples, corresponding to

120

positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 91.7%, respectively (Fig. 2g).

121

Here we combined isothermal amplification with CRISPR-Cas12 DETECTR

122

technology to develop a rapid (~30 min) and low-cost test for detection of SARS-CoV-2

123

in clinical samples. The use of existing qRT-PCR based assays is hindered by the need

124

for expensive lab instrumentation, and availability is currently restricted to public health

125

laboratories. Importantly, the DETECTR assays developed here have comparable

126

accuracy to qRT-PCR and are broadly accessible, as they use routine protocols and

127

commercially available, “off-the-shelf” reagents. Key advantages of our approach over

128

existing methods such as qRT-PCR include (1) isothermal signal amplification for rapid

129

target detection obviating the need for thermocycling, (2) single nucleotide target

130

specificity (guide RNAs at the N2 site can distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV

131

and MERS-CoV), (3) integration with portable, low-cost reporting formats such as lateral

132

flow strips, and (4) quick development cycle to address emerging threats from novel

133

zoonotic viruses (<2 weeks for SARS-CoV-2, Supplementary Fig. 6).

134

Although most of the cases of COVID-19 infection during the first month of the

135

epidemic were traced to the city of Wuhan and Hubei province in China, the ongoing

136

rise in cases now appears to be driven to local community transmission15,16. For a

137

number of reasons, there is an urgent public health need for rapid diagnostic tests for

138

SARS-CoV-2 infection. The documented cases of asymptomatic infection and

139

transmission in COVID-19 patients4,5 greatly expand the pool of individuals who need to

140

be screened. Viral titers in hospitalized patients can fluctuate day-to-day with lack of

141

correlation to disease severity17-19, and thus a single negative qRT-PCR test for SARS-

142

CoV-2 does not exclude infection. The virus has also been shown to be shed in stool20,

143

raising the possibility of environmental contamination contributing to local disease

144

outbreaks. Low testing platforms such as the DETECTR CRISPR-Cas12 assay

145

developed here may be useful for periodic repeat testing of patient samples. Clinical

146

validation of this assay in response to recent draft guidance from the US FDA7 is

147

currently ongoing in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)-certified

148

microbiology laboratory.

149

The major pandemics and large-scale epidemics of the past half century have all

150

been caused by zoonotic viruses. Despite these recurrent outbreaks, we still do not

151

have a programmable point of care (POC) diagnostic platform that can be used to

152

promptly address any emerging viral threat. The CRISPR-based DETECTR technology

153

provides such a platform, which we have reconfigured within days to detect SARS-CoV-

154

2 (Supplementary Fig. 6). Here we developed a SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR assay,

155

described its performance characteristics and demonstrated compatibility with lateral

156

flow strips. The future development of portable microfluidic-based cartridges to run the

157

assay and use of lyophilized reagents will enable POC testing outside of the clinical

158

diagnostic laboratory, such as airports, local emergency departments and clinics, and

159

other decentralized locations.

METHODS

220

Nucleic acid preparation
SARS-CoV-2 target sequences were designed using all available genomes

221
222

available from GISAID21 as of January 27, 2020. Briefly, viral genomes were aligned

223

using Clustal Omega. Next, LbCas12a target sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome were

224

filtered against SARS-CoV, two bat-SARS-like-CoV genomes and common human

225

coronavirus genomes. Compatible target sites were finally compared to those used in

226

current protocols from the CDC and WHO. LAMP primers for SARS-CoV-2 were

227

designed against regions of the N-gene and E-gene using PrimerExplorer v5

228

(https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). RNase P POP7 primers were originally published by

229

Curtis, et al. (2018) and a compatible gRNA was designed to function with these primer

230

sets.

231

Target RNAs were generated from synthetic gene fragments of the viral genes of

232

interest. First a PCR step was performed on the synthetic gene fragment with a forward

233

primer that contained a T7 promoter. Next, the PCR product was used as the template

234

for an in-vitro transcription (IVT) reaction at 37°C for 2 hours. The IVT reaction was then

235

treated with TURBO DNase (Thermo) for 30 min at 37°C, followed by a heat-

236

denaturation step at 75°C for 15 min. RNA was purified using RNA Clean and

237

Concentrator 5 columns (Zymo Research). RNA was quantified by Nanodrop and Qubit

238

and diluted in nuclease-free water to working concentrations.

240
241

DETECTR assays
DETECTR assays were performed using RT-LAMP for pre-amplification of viral

242

or control RNA targets and LbCas12a for the trans-cleavage assay. RT-LAMP was

243

prepared as suggested by New England Biolabs

244

(https://www.neb.com/protocols/2014/10/09/typical-rt-lamp-protocol) with a MgSO4

245

concentration of 6.5 mM and a final volume of 10 µL. LAMP primers were added at a

246

final concentration of 0.2 µM for F3 and B3, 1.6 µM for FIP and BIP, and 0.8 µM for LF

247

and LB. Reactions were performed independently for N-gene, E-gene, and RNase P

248

using 2 µL of input RNA at 62°C for 20 min.

249

LbCas12a trans-cleavage assays were performed similar to those described in

250

Chen, et al. (2018). 50 nM LbCas12a (available from NEB) was pre-incubated with 62.5

251

nM gRNA in 1X NEBuffer 2.1 for 30 min at 37°C. After formation of the RNA-protein

252

complex, the lateral flow cleavage reporter (/56-FAM/TTATTATT/3Bio/, IDT) was added

253

to the reaction at a final concentration of 500 nM. RNA-protein complexes were used

254

immediately or stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours before use.

255
256
257

Lateral flow readout
After completion of the pre-amplification step, 2 µL of amplicon was combined

258

with 18 µL of LbCas12a-gRNA complex and 80 µL of 1X NEBuffer 2.1. The 100 µL

259

LbCas12a trans-cleavage assay was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37°C.

260

A lateral flow strip (Milenia HybriDetect 1, TwistDx) was then added to the reaction tube

261

and a result was visualized after approximately 2 min. A single band, close to the

263

top of the strip or two bands indicated a positive result.

Optimized DETECTR method for patient samples

266

The patient optimized DETECTR assays were performed using RT-LAMP

267

method as described above with the following modifications: A DNA binding dye,

268

SYTO9 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), was included in the reaction to monitor the

269

amplification reaction and the incubation time was extended to 30 min to capture data

270

from lower titre samples.

271

The fluorescence based patient optimized LbCas12a trans-cleavage assays

272

were performed as described above with modifications; 40nM LbCas12a was pre-

273

incubated with 40nM gRNA, after which 100nM of a fluorescent reporter molecule

274

compatible with detection in the presence of the SYTO9 dye

275

(/5Alex594N/TTATTATT/3IAbRQSp/) was added to the complex. 2 µL of amplicon was

276

combined with 18 µL of LbCas12a-gRNA complex in a black 384-well assay plate and

277

monitored for fluorescence using a Tecan plate reader.

IVT RNA products from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bast-SL-CoVZC45, and clinical

318

samples from common human coronaviruses. As expected, the N-gene is only detected

319

in SARS-CoV-2, whereas the E-gene is detected only in SARS-CoV-2 and bat-SL-

320

CoVZC45. SARS-CoV E-gene was not detected as the RT-LAMP primer set is not

321

capable of amplifying the SARS-CoV E-gene, even though the E-gene gRNA is capable

322

of detecting the SARS-CoV E-gene target site. RNase P is detected in common human

323

coronaviruses because these samples are RNA extracted from clinical samples. Result
