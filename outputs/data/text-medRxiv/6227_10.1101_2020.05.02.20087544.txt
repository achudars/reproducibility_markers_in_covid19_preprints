Abstract

2

COVID-19 the modern pandemic has spread across the world at a rapid pace. SARS-CoV

3

2 is highly transmissible and the rate of infection is exponential for heavily infected countries.

4

Asymptotic carriers and longer incubation period have been key towards such a large-scale

5

distribution of disease. Data released by official authorities on COVID-19 cases is significantly

6

affected by various factors such as size of sample, incubation period of disease and time taken to

7

test the sample. These factors mask the useful pattern (signal) of disease spread. Thus, an

8

ingenious method to group data into cycles of five and seven days, for studying pattern of

9

disease spread is undertaken. Occurrence of recurrent peaks as indicated by Adjusted Rate of

10

infection per day indicated the spread of disease has been non-uniform. Currently, India is yet to

11

reach the critical point (peak of epidemic) with adjusted daily cases more than 1000. Increasing

12

testing capacity along with random sampling and sample pooling can help in preventing

13

formation of these peaks in future. The proposed method helps in assessing the current state and

14

for predicting future scenarios epidemics.

1. Introduction

18

Novel coronavirus has swept the world at rapid pace with more than 3 million cases

19

across 185 countries since its first report on November, 2019 in Wuhan, China. The disease was

20

termed as Public Health Emergency by World Health Organization (WHO)on January 30, 2020

21

and further on 11 March was announced as pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in huge

22

economic cost, loss of jobs and resulting in largest global recession since The Great Depression

23

(Gopinath, 2020). The International Virus Classification Commission (ICTV) classified this

24

novel coronavirus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on

25

February 11, 2020 and on the same day WHO named the disease as COVID-19. Virus is

26

transmitted mainly through respiratory droplets and has high transmissibility rate but low

27

mortality unlike Middle Easter Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV 1 which have

28

high mortality rate. The mean incubation period of disease is6.6 with range of 2.1 to 11.1

29

days(Backer et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020). COVID-19 symptoms include aches and pains,

30

nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea and needs technical tests such as RT-PCR,

31

Anti body testing or CRISPAR (Liu et al., 2020) to detect the virus. Many cases are reported

32

were no symptoms are visible but the person is tested positive for the virus. These asymptotic

33

people have been key for such a large scale spread of virus.

34

India reported its first case on 30 January, 2020 from Southern state of Kerala, who was a

35

returning student from Wuhan, China. Only three cases were reported up till 1 March and since

36

then the cases have increased exponentially and as of April 23, 27000 cases have to identified

37

with Maharashtra recording highest positive cases. The virus has entered the country through

38

foreign travelers coming mainly from China, Europe US and Gulf countries. Foreign flights were

39

stopped on 22 March and nation-wide lockdown was announced on 24 March for 21 days i.e. up

40

till 14 April which was further extended to 3 May. But large population of migrant workers had

41

returned to their native place during initial days of lockdown. Currently, in India, asymptotic

42

people with international travel history and all contacts of laboratory confirmed positive cases

43

are being tested for the virus mainly through RT-PCR. As of now there have been no effective

44

drugs or vaccine against the disease, thus identifying positive cases and isolating/treating them is

45

effective option.

46

Compartmental models namely SIR (Susceptible, Infectious and Recovered) models and

47

their modification (Giordano et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020, Prem et al., 2020) are widely used in

48

analyzing the epidemiological data. Furthermore, statistical models such as ARIMA and neural

49

networks (Wei et al., 2016, Anne and Jeeva, 2020, Ceylan, 2020) are used in forecasting the

50

COVID-19 cases. These models become complex when a high number of parameters are

51

involved. Thus, here we formulate a simple statistical method to study the growth of epidemics

52

and predict future scenarios based on only the positive cases reported.

53

2. Methodology

54

Data of positive cases for COVID-19 epidemic was collected from Johns Hopkins

55

University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE, 2020) starting from 22

56

February up to 23 April.
Let the first day i.e. February 22 be d1, February 23d2 and so on with dn being nth day from

57
58

the first day.

59

cc1, cc2, cc3, ………ccn is number of cumulative cases (cc) for the d1, d2, d3, …………dn day and

60

dc1, dc2, dc3, ………dcn is number of daily cases (dc) for d1, d2, d3, …………dn day.

𝑑𝑐𝑛 is number of positive cases for nthday,

68

𝑑𝑐(𝑛−1) is number of positive cases for (n-1)thday

69

Cumulative cases (cc) or daily cases (dc) reported by official authorities is a mixture of

70

both useful signal and noise. A clear pattern of epidemic growth cannot be ascertained from the

71

raw data itself. Thus, in order to obtain a clear picture of epidemic growth and to minimize the

72

noise (sampling effect) in the data we group the data based on five day and seven day cycle to

73

estimate new coefficients 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 and 𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 as described below.

74

Let ‘c’ be the number of days in a given cycle, then number of possible combinations the

75

data can be grouped is equal to ‘m’ which are repeated over ‘i’ intervals where ‘m’ is equal to

76

‘c’. These combinations are referred to as Models from henceforth. In the current study we group

77

the data in cycle of five days (5D) and seven days (7D).

The unadjusted daily cases (𝑈𝑑𝑐𝑛 ) is defined as daily cases calculated from official record i.e.

111

dc1, dc2, dc3 …...

112

2.1 Outliers

113

If the magnitude of 𝑃𝐶𝐼𝑐𝑚(𝑖−1) is less than 10 it leads to greater 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 which effects the

114

𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 and masks pattern in the growth of epidemic. Thus, if 𝑃𝐶𝐼𝑐𝑚(𝑖−1) < 10, then respective

115

𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 are removed from analysis.

116

2.2 Critical Point

117

Critical point is defined as a stage where the 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 or adjusted daily cases (𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 ) are equal
100
,respectively. In other words, critical point refers to period past the peak of the
𝑐

118

to 100 and

119

epidemic curve. The 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 critical point for 5D and 7D cycle is 25 and 14.29, respectively.

120

2.3 Classifying the growth of epidemic period

121

Based on the critical point, the epidemic period can be classified into two phases,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087544; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

122

a. Growth phase: It is the initial phase were epidemic has not yet reached the critical point.

123

During this period of epidemic during which the number of daily cases is continuously

124

rising and epidemic is yet to reach its peak stage.

125
126
127

b. Safe phase: It is the phase after passing the critical point or peak of epidemic when the
daily cases are continuously decreasing.
2.4 Prediction of 𝑨𝑹𝒄𝒏 values

128

ARIMA is a statistical method to forecast time series data which was proposed by Box

129

and Jenkins in 1970. These models have been commonly used to forecast COVID-19 positive

130

cases (Benvenuto et. al., 2020, Ceylan, 2020, Anne and Jeeva, 2020). ARIMA model was used to

131

forecast the 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 value of 5D and 7D cycle. The three best fitting parameters of ARIMA model

132

p (order of autoregression), d (degree of difference) and q (order of moving average) were (2, 0,

133

0) and (3, 2, 1) for 5D and 7D cycle selected based on root mean square error (RMSE).

134

Furthermore, univariate Neural Network Models (NNM) were used in predicting the 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 of 5D

135

and 7D cycle by using forecast package in R.

136

3. Result and Discussion

137

COVID-19 pandemic has caused large scale disruption of normal life with nationwide

138

lockdown being imposed to control spread of virus. We have analyzed the data in a novel way to

139

understand growth of virus and anticipate future conditions. Unadjusted rate of infection per day

140

(𝑈𝑅𝑑 ) plot (Figure 1) estimated from raw data shows continuous fluctuation throughout the

141

epidemic period. No growth pattern of disease can be delineated from the plot. The reason for

142

such fluctuation is that raw data is a mixture of both useful signal which represents growth of

143

epidemic along with redundant noises which mask the signal. The noise in the data arises due to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087544; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

144

various reasons such as sampling size, time taken to test the sample, time taken to trace the

145

contacts and incubation period for the patient. Thus, making it impossible to assess present

146

situation and predict future conditions using 𝑈𝑅𝑑 plots.

147

3.1 Analyzing Adjusted Rate of Infection per day (𝑨𝑹𝒄𝒏 )

148

In order to reduce the noise embedded in raw data, we grouped raw data into 7D and 5D

149

cycle and estimated the adjusted rate of infection per day. 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 plot (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) for 7D

150

and 5D cycle reveals the pattern of spread of Epidemic. The Epidemic period can be classified

151

into four and three phases (Table 1) as per 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 of 5D and 7D cycle respectively. Phase 1 (5D)

152

was from5 March to 16 March, with peak on 14 March and Phase 2 (5D) from 17 March to 28

153

March with peak on 21 March. The first two phases of 5D combine to form Phase 1 of 7D cycle

154

which was from 5 March to 29 March with peak on 22 March. During these initial stages of

155

epidemic, the virus is difficult to detect due to high incubation period, asymptotic carriers and

156

technical tests to detect the virus. Thus, the virus spreads can spread unnoticed if proper

157

preventive measures are not undertaken. With increase in testing capacity a greater number of

158

COVID-19 cases are detected in short time leading to formation of peak on 22 April.

159

Phase 3 (5D) from 29 March to 8 April with peak on 2 April and Phase 2 (7D) 30 March

160

to 13 April with peak on 3 April can be attributed to Tablighi Jamaat congregation which was

161

held in New Delhi during mid-March. Many of the attendees have been tested positive. Finally,

162

we observe another peak on 13 April under Phase 4 (5D) starting from 10 April. In a 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 plot

163

the new peaks formed are more severe than that of early ones. Meaning peak of Phase 4 (5D) is

164

more severe than peak of Phase 3 (5D) and Phase 2 (7D) which is further more severe than peak

165

of Phase 1 (7D) or Phase 2 (5D). The 5D cycle detected a greater number of peaks than 7D cycle

166

as it is more sensitive to sudden increase in cases within short period of time. The recurrent

167

peaks which we observe in 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 plots may be attributed to limited coverage of testing facility

168

which allows the virus to spread through asymptotic carriers.

169

3.2 Impact of Nationwide lockdown

170

Nationwide shutdown started from 24 March and is scheduled to be lifted on May 3. As

171

seen from the 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 plot the rate of new infection starts to decrease after its peak on March 22.

172

The nationwide lockdown has significantly slowed the spread of virus, but it should be followed

173

by wide scale testing in order to identify the infected people. Delay in action or lack of testing

174

would lead to increase in 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 or under more severe conditions new peaks are formed.

175

3.3 Analyzing 𝑹𝒄𝒎𝒊 plots

176

𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 represents change in rate of infection for a given days of cycle. When the spread is

177

constant the𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 of all models for any days of cycle start converging and continue in same

178

direction. But when growth is non-uniform the models start bisecting each other.

179

For seven-day cycle 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 plot (Fig. 4) highest value is 521 of Model 7for interval March

180

20 to March 26 which coincides with peak of Phase 1 (7D). The models are continuously

181

bisecting each other indicating the spread or detection of virus has not been uniform. Similarly,

182

𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 plot of five-day cycle indicates same trend of bisecting models with highest value of

183

455.263 for interval March 20 to March 24 coinciding with peak of Phase 2 (5D). As seen from

184

the analysis of other countries (not shown) the Models tend to converge (or are close to each

185

other) before reaching the critical point.

186

3.4 Adjusted daily cases (𝑨𝒅𝒄𝒏 )

187

𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 accommodates the fluctuation in the original data to produce a smooth curve

188

representing increase in daily cases. India passed 𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 (Fig. 5) of 1,000 on 14 April and as of 18

189

April, with current 𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 being 1173 and 1164 as calculated from 5D and 7D cycle respectively.

190

𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 is continuously increasing during growth phase whereas starts decreasing once in safe

191

phase. Thus, delay in reaching the critical point enhances the severity of Epidemic.

192

3.5 Future course of Epidemic

193

ARIMA model forecasted (Fig. 6) formation of peak on 28 April for 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 of 5D cycle

194

whereas for 7D cycle it forecasted a gradual decrease. Similarly, neural network model (NNM)

195

forecasted (Fig. 7) towards formation of peak on 30 April for 5D cycle and gradual increase in

196

𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 for 7D cycle.

197

As seen from the 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 plot, though the rate of infection decreasing it the rate at which it

198

is decreasing is slowing down. The last 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 value for 7D cycleincreased from 128.22 (𝑅769 ) to

199

129.69 (𝑅779 ), similar trend was observed for 5D cycle which indicates a possible rise COVID-

200

19 positive cases. Presently India is in growth stage where 𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 is continuously rising. With

201

recurrent peaks occurring, India may not reach critical point within May 3, the scheduled date to

202

end the nationwide lockdown. Reducing 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 and 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 can be achieved through rigorous

203

contact tracing and alternate testing methods such as Rapid antibody testing, CRISPAR (Liu et

204

al., 2020) and sample pooling method (Hogan et al., 2020) can be useful for a large nation as

205

India.

206

3.6 Limitations of the method

207

As of other statistical methods there are few limitations for the present method. When the

208

spread of disease is slow the 𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 and 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 plot can’t depict the pattern of disease spread. Thus,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.02.20087544; this version posted May 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

209

the method is useful where local transmission or community spread of disease is prevalent.

210

Pattern of disease spread is delineated by the method is based on reported data and doesn’t

211

consider the underlaying unreported cases.

212

4. Conclusion

213

𝐴𝑅𝑐𝑛 and 𝑅𝑐𝑚𝑖 plots help us in understanding the pattern of Epidemic and predicting the

214

future scenario by minimizing the noise using in the raw data. The growth of epidemic in India

215

has been non-uniform and is currently growing in linear fashion with 𝐴𝑑𝑐𝑛 crossing 1,000.

216

Lockdown combined with greater testing capacity is crucial to contain the spread of novel

217

coronavirus. In the current study, we employed ingenious method to classify data into5D and 7D

218

cycle to assess spread of virus and predict the future progression of epidemic. The method is

219

simple and robust which uses publicly and most commonly available data.
