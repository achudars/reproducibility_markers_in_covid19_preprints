ABSTRACT

The pandemic cased by coronavirus COVID-19 is of great concern. A detailed scientific analysis of
this phenomenon is still to come, but now it is urgently needed to evaluate the disease dynamics in
order to organize the appropriate quarantine activities, to estimate the required number of places in
hospitals, the level of individual protection, the rate of isolation of infected persons, etc. South
Korea has achieved the stabilization of the number of cases at rather low level. The epidemic
dynamics there can be compared with its development in other countries to make some preliminary,
but very important conclusions. Here we provide a simple method of data comparison that can be
useful for both governmental organizations and anyone.

Introduction
Some previous efforts to compare the epidemic dynamics in Italy and mainland China has been
done in [1, 2]. Here we will try to compare the epidemics in Italy, Spain, Germany, France,
Switzerland, and USA with the situation in South Korea, where the number of cases is stabilizing at
rather low level and the mortality rate is not high. We improved the very simple method proposed in
[1] which now can by applied for every country. To illustrate its application, the epidemic dynamics
in Austria was estimated.

We will use official data about the accumulated number of confirmed cases in Italy, Spain,
France, Germany, Switzerland, USA, South Korea Vj from WHO daily situation reports [3], see

Table 2. The number of cases in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Switzerland and USA
used for comparisons and the results of calculations.
The information about the confirmed accumulated number of cases from [3]. The mortality
rate was calculated with the use of numbers for March 14, 2020 (the situation report dated March
16, 2020, [3]). The corresponding time moments tej are shown in the last column. The values
corresponding the beginning of the epidemic outbreak are shown in red. The values dt were
calculated with the use of formula (2).

Time synchronization procedure
We have to calculate the number of days from start of the epidemic outbreak (which is different
for every country, see red values in the last column of Table 2) to compare with the data set listed in
Table 1. To increase the accuracy, we let this number to be non-integer. To calculate the
corresponding time difference dt , we use the parabolic interpolation for the initial number of cases
V in South Korea. The first three points in Table 1 yield the corresponding equation:

V  at 2  bt  51 ;

a=16.5,

b=36.5

(1)

Then by putting into (1) the values V=Vb for the number of cases at the starting day of the epidemic
outbreak (shown in red in Table 2), the corresponding values dt were calculated for every country
with the use of formula

dt 

b  b2  4ac
;
2a

c=51-Vb

(2)

which yields a solution to the quadratic equation (1). The calculated values of dt are shown in the
last row of Table 2. Then the time moments for Italy have to be shifted by 0.549 days, for Germany
by 6+0.154 days and so on.

Results and discussion

in days from the beginning of the epidemic outbreaks.

The synchronized data sets are shown in the Fig. 1 by “stars” for countries in Europe and by
“squares” for USA. The data for South Korea are shown by red line with “circles”. Blue “stars”
represent the sum of cases for 5 countries in Europe. It can be seen that Italy, Spain and France have
no chance for rapid stabilization of the number of cases. But it is still possible in Germany,
Switzerland and USA. Very high mortality rate in Italy and Spain makes the situation really
dramatic. Blue “stars” in the Fig. 1 still follow the straight line. It means that the number of cases in
Europe still increases exponentially and is far from stabilization.
It seems that main reason for the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy and Spain is the
slow isolation of infected and contact persons. For example, in South Korea an infected person
spreads the infection approximately 4.3 hours (in average), [4]; the mortality rate is 0.92%. By
comparison, in mainland China this time is estimated as 2.5 days [5].

How to estimate the epidemic dynamics for other countries?
For example, let us illustrate the application of this simple procedure for Austria. The number
of cases in this country was Vb =66 on March 6, 2020. Let us suppose that epidemic in this country
started on this day. Corresponding value of tej = 13 (see Table 2) and dt =0.3542 (according to eq.
(2)). If we want to know how looks the situation on March 15, 2020 (ninth day of the epidemic), we
open the corresponding WHO report (number 56) and find their the number 959 for Austria. This
figure has to be compared with the number of cases from Table 1, corresponding to the time
moment 9+0.3542. To avoid any additional calculations, let us take the value 2337 for comparison.
Thus the situation in Austria does not look bad. This country is able to stabilize the number of cases
soon.

Conclusions
The situation with the coronavirus pandemic in Europe is very threatening. Italy and Spain are in
urgent need of assistance in speeding up the isolation of infected and contact persons.
