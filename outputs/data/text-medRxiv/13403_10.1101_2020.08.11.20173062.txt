Abstract

21

In the absence of an effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 it is important to be able to track

22

community infections to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread and therefore

23

reduce pressures on health-care units, improve health outcomes and reduce economic uncertainty.

24

Wastewater surveillance has rapidly emerged as a potential tool to effectively monitor community

25

infections for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through measuring trends

26

of viral RNA signal in wastewater systems. In this study SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA N1 and N2 genes are

27

quantified in solids collected from influent post grit solids (PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two

28

water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) serving Canada’s national capital region, i.e., the City of

29

Ottawa , ON (pop. ≈ 1.1M) and the City of Gatineau, QC (pop. ≈ 280K). PCS samples show signal

30

inhibition using RT-ddPCR compared to RT-qPCR, with PGS samples showing similar quantifiable

31

concentrations of RNA using both assays. RT-qPCR shows higher frequency of detection of N1 and N2

32

genes in PCS (92.7, 90.6%) as compared to PGS samples (79.2, 82.3%). Sampling of PCS may

33

therefore be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 viral quantification, especially during periods of

34

declining and low COVID-19 incidence in the community. The pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV) is

35

determined to have a less variable RNA signal in PCS over a three month period for two WRRFs,

36

regardless of environmental conditions, compared to Bacteroides 16S rRNA or human eukaryotic 18S

37

rRNA, making PMMV a potentially useful biomarker for normalization of SARS-CoV-2 signal. PMMV-

38

normalized PCS RNA signal from WRRFs of two cities correlated with the regional public health

39

epidemiological metrics, identifying PCS normalized to a fecal indicator (PMMV) as a potentially effective

40

tool for monitoring trends during decreasing and low-incidence of infection of SARS-Cov-2 in

41

communities.

1. Introduction

45

Since the onset of the novel coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), the rapid transmission and

46

global spread of the disease has placed significant strain on public health agencies around the world.

47

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens by reverse transcription

48

quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the standard diagnostic test to confirm COVID-19.

49

Accurately measuring the prevalence of COVID-19 in many countries has been complicated by limited

50

and/or biased NP testing (targeting symptomatic groups) and an asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic

51

infectious period in a significant proportion of cases (Long et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020). Additional

52

detection tools are thus desirable to mitigate these challenges and provide public health agencies and

53

governments new metrics to help guide their implementation of societal restrictions (Daughton, 2009; Hill

54

et al., 2020; Thompson et al., 2020).

55

Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the current peer-reviewed and preprint literature

56

confirm fecal SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection in roughly half of COVID-19 patients (Gupta et al., 2020;

57

Parasa et al., 2020). Moreover, a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA

58

detection profiles in several different types of COVID-19 patient specimens found that positive detection

59

rates were higher in rectal and sputum swabs than in the commonly used NP swab (Bwire et al., 2020).

60

These data provide a clear rationale to probe wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

61

Medema et al. (2020) first reported the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in wastewater from

62

WRRFs located in seven different cities in the Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA has subsequently

63

been identified and is being monitored at numerous WRRFs around the world (Ahmed et al., 2020a;

64

Alpaslan-Kocamemi et al., 2020; Bar Or et al., 2020; Haramoto et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020;

65

Medema et al., 2020; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020a; Randazzo et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al.,

66

2020; Wu et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) The successful monitoring of the viral

67

signal has led the Netherlands (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, 2020), Australia

68

(Dalzell, 2020), Germany (Pleitgen, 2020) and Finland (Yle, 2020) to plan and implement national

69

wastewater surveillance programs for SARS-CoV-2 as a viral tracking tool to complement existing public

70

health metrics. There are also early and promising indications from several research groups that

71

wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 might be predictive, providing earlier warning of community

72

outbreak than current NP-based PCR diagnostics.

73

Although studies reported some success in the detection and even quantitation of SARS-CoV-2

74

RNA by RT-qPCR in wastewaters over the course of community COVID-19 outbreaks, poor assay

75

sensitivity and systematic variation represent significant challenges, particularly in regions with low

76

COVID-19 prevalence (Bar-On et al., 2020; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020; Orive et al., 2020; Randazzo

77

et al., 2020). Specifically, monitoring in communities with low incidence has demonstrated high PCR Ct

78

values and hence variable or unquantifiable data being collected due to very low concentrations of the

79

viral fragments in wastewaters. In this regard, at least two groups have identified improved sensitivity in

80

solids-rich wastewater samples collected from WRRFs in communities with low incidence and prevalence

81

(<25 active cases/100,000 population) (Balboa et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020b, 2020a). However, it has

82

been observed that due to variations both in case numbers and influent wastewater sample data

83

(Medema et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), studies have so far reported high day to day variance and noise

84

(Balboa et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020a); which is a key challenge in establishing trends and extracting

85

meaningful information from SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sentinel surveillance programs to date.

86

This study investigates and optimizes the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater influent

87

solids (post-grit solids; PGS) and primary clarified sludge (PCS) in two municipal WRRFs serving Ottawa

88

and Gatineau beginning after the height of the epidemic with a period (April to May 2020) characterized

89

by decreasing COVID-19 incidence and a subsequent period (May to June 2020) of low COVID-19

90

prevalence. Using both RT-qPCR and RT-droplet digital (dd) PCR, rigorous quality control metrics are

91

applied to compare the detection sensitivity of viral N1 and N2 RNA in PGS compared to PCS using two

92

different established primer/probe sets. Furthermore, the study tests the human microbiome-specific

93

HF183 Bacteroides 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) the eukaryotic 18S rRNA and pepper mild mottle virus

94

(PMMV) RNA as reliable and robust nucleic acid normalization biomarkers that can be used to control

95

systematic noise associated with variances in WRRF daily operations, sampling, storage, processing and

96

analysis of the samples. Finally, the study compares and correlates biomarker normalized longitudinal

Post-grit chamber influent solids and primary clarified sludge samples were collected from the

103

City of Ottawa’s Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre, Ontario and the City of Gatineau, Quebec

104

water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). The two facilities are located across the Ottawa River from

105

each other in the national capital region of Canada (Figure 1). The two WRRFs service over 1.3 million

106

people, or approximately 3.7% of Canada’s total population. The sewershed of the City of Ottawa WRRF

107

services approximately 1.1M people and the sewershed of the city of Gatineau WRRF services

108

approximately 280K people.

Wastewater sampling and analysis

120

2.2.1. PGS samples

121

Fourteen and nine 24-hour composite PGS samples were analyzed from the Ottawa and

122

Gatineau WRRFs, respectively. Clean 250 mL HDPE sampling bottles were sanitized with a 10% bleach

123

solution and then washed with RNAse AWAY

124

water, and sealed. The PGS samples in this study are collected in the stream exiting the grit chambers.

125

These samples have large debris removed via screens as was the dense grit via the grit chamber. A bio-

126

banked wastewater influent sample from a nearby WRRF collected in August 2019 was utilized as a

127

SARS-COV-2 negative control (Supplemental Figure S1).

250 mL hourly composite samples were collected over a 24-hour period (for a total of 6 L) using

129

an ISCO autosampler (Hoskin Scientific, Burlington, Canada) that collects directly from the exit stream of

130

the grit chamber units at both facilities. The samples in the ISCO autosamplers were maintained at

131

approximately 4°C during sampling with the frequent addition of ice (with a maximum recorded

132

temperature of 7°C across the study). Starting in June, the ISCO autosamplers were linked to

133

refrigerators, allowing the samples to be kept at temperatures of approximately 2°C immediately upon

134

collection. The harvested samples were transported from the WRRFs to the laboratory in coolers packed

135

on ice and were immediately refrigerated at 4°C for a maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis.

136

2.2.2. PCS samples

137

For the first 55 days of the study, grab samples of PCS were collected every second week at the

138

Ottawa and Gatineau WRRFs. These sludge samples were harvested from the primary sludge streams in

139

the two facilities at the manifold where the primary clarified sludge that exits all primary clarifiers was

140

mixed into a single stream. From day 56 onward, with the stronger RNA signal detected in PCS samples

141

as compared to PGS samples, 24-hour composite PCS samples were collected by plant process

142

technicians every other day at the Ottawa facility. The 24-hour composite samples collected at the Ottawa

143

WRRF were comprised of four grab samples collected every 6 hours. Upon collection, samples were

144

stored on-site at the Ottawa facility at 4°C in a refrigerator until mixed to form daily 24-hour composite

145

samples and transported on ice to the laboratory the subsequent day. All samples were stored at 4°C at

146

the laboratory and processed within 6 hours of arrival. Samples which could not immediately be analyzed

147

were stored at 4°C for a maximum of 24 hours prior to analysis in the laboratory. Meanwhile, in Gatineau,

148

an ISCO autosampler was linked to a refrigerator and was connected to a PCS sampling port. The

149

autosampler collected hourly grab samples of 250 mL, which were subsequently mixed to form a 24-hour

150

composite sample. Due to the size differences of the two facilities in this study and the available

151

resources at the two facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the Gatineau facility sampling

152

frequency was limited to a maximum of once a week as opposed to every second day as was performed

153

at the larger Ottawa facility. The 24-hour composite samples were collected and transported on ice to the

154

laboratory as outlined for the Ottawa samples.

2.2.3. Wastewater quality characterization of samples

156

The following PGS and PCS sample wastewater quality constituents were analyzed upon

157

collection: biological oxygen demand (BOD) (5210 B) (APHA, WEF, 2012), chemical oxygen demand

158

(COD) (SM 5220 D) (APHA, WEF, 2012), total suspended solids, volatile suspended solids, total solids

159

and total volatile solids (TSS, VSS, TS & VS) (SM 2540 D, E & B) (APHA, WEF, 2012), total ammonia

160

nitrogen (TAN) (SM 4500-C) (APHA, 1989). Dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH values were measured on-

161

site during collection of samples with a YSI ProODO (Yellow Springs, FL) and HACH PHC201/HACH

162

HQ40d probe/meter combo (Loveland, CO).

163

2.3.

SARS-CoV-2 concentration

164

A preliminary study was first performed on partitioned 24-hour composite PGS samples to identify

165

fractions with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity (Figure 2). The 6 L, 24-hour composite PGS samples were first

166

settled at 4°C for an hour. The supernatant was subsequently decanted and serially filtered through a 1.5

167

µm glass fiber filter (GFF) followed by a 0.45 µm GF6 mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter (filtrate fraction).

168

An eluate fraction was then collected by passing 32 mL of elution buffer (0.05 M KH2PO4, 1.0 M NaCl, 0.1

169

% (v/v) Triton X-100, pH 9.2) through the spent filters. Each of the three fractions were subsequently

PEG-concentrated and extracted and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

171

To concentrate viral particles, nucleic acids, and proteins, 32 mL of PGS or PCS was precipitated

172

with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 at a final concentration of 80 g/L and 0.3M g/L NaCl, pH 7.3 and in a

173

final volume of 40 mL (Comelli et al., 2008; Petterson et al., 2015). Samples were then agitated at 4°C on

174

an orbital shaker set at 160 RPM for a period of 12 to 17 hours, then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 45

175

minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was decanted, being careful to preserve any pellet. Samples were then

176

centrifuged a second time at 10,000 x g for another 10 minutes and the remaining supernatant decanted.

177

The resulting PCS and PGS pellets were transferred to a new RNase-free centrifuge tube and frozen at -

178

80°C until RNA extraction.

179

2.4.

RNA extraction

180

Viral RNA was extracted from PGS and PCS samples using the RNeasy PowerMicrobiome Kit

181

(Qiagen, Germantown, MD), with the following deviations from the manufacturer’s recommended

182

protocol: i) 200 mg of sample pellet was added to the initial extraction step in place of 200 µL of liquid

183

sample, and ii) the optional phenol-chloroform mixture addition to the lysis buffer was substituted with

184

Trizol LS reagent (ThermoFisher, Ottawa, Canada) to maximize lysis of cells/virion encapsulated

185

fragments and protect RNA prior to vortexing and centrifugation. The resulting aqueous phase of the lysis

186

procedure was then retained and processed as per the recommended protocol including the on-column

187

enzymatic DNA removal step. RNA was eluted in 100 µl of RNAse-free water.

188

2.5.

Viral recovery efficiency

189

An important metric in the quantification of viral signal in wastewater is the process recovery

190

efficiency for targets of interest, as it facilitates a comparison of results from study to study, even if

191

different sample processing or extraction methodologies/techniques are used. In this study, the efficiency

192

of virus recovery following the fractionation, PEG concentration and RNA extraction process was

193

determined by spiking vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and quantifying the recovered quantities of virus

194

after sample processing. Spiking samples with a human coronavirus with low pathogenicity such as

195

HCoV-229E as a recovery control (Gundy et al., 2009) was desirable but not practical due to the relative

196

difficulty of its procurement in Canada at the time of this study and the difficulty of propagating

197

coronaviruses in vitro. VSV is an enveloped, single stranded negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the

198

Rhabdoviridae family, genus Vesiculovirus (Letchworth et al., 1999). The RNA genomes of both VSV and

199

SARS-CoV-2 are encapsulated by a lipid envelope, and their particle sizes are similar; with VSV ranging

200

from 70-200 nm (Cureton et al., 2010) and SARS-CoV-2 being approximately 100 nm (Supplemental

201

Figure S2) (Bar-On et al., 2020). It was reasoned that these similar biophysical characteristics (lipid

202

envelope and particle size) would lead both viruses to associate with wastewater matrices and to be

203

precipitated with PEG with similar efficiencies. To maximize safety of the method, VSV was heat

204

inactivated at 55°C for five minutes prior to use (Supplemental Figure S3).

205

Recovery efficiency was quantified twice during this study, following procedures similar to those

206

outlined in Annex G of ISO 15216-1:2017 (ISO, 2017; Lowther et al., 2019; Randazzo et al., 2020). VSV

was quantified via RT-ddPCR for both PGS and PCS from triplicate, serial dilutions of 5.5x10 , 5.5x10 ,

209

samples and the PCS samples. Throughout the study, quantified quantities were not corrected for

process extraction efficiency or for PCR inhibition. Three PCS and PGS samples were each spiked with

concentrated, extracted and quantified using RT-qPCR. The probes and primers used are listed in

213

based on the number of copies quantified using RT-qPCR. The equation for the calculations is as follows:

Variance of biomarkers for normalization

217

Analysis of variance was used to identify biomarkers with low variability and higher temporal

218

consistency. The analysis of variance was conducted on 30 PGS and PCS samples over a period of 55

219

days (between April 8th 2020 and June 2nd 2020). The samples were analyzed for the following three

RT-qPCR

223

Preliminary testing of samples with the CDC N1, N2 and N3 primer-probe sets and the Sarbeco

224

E-gene primer-probe set (Supplemental Table S3) demonstrated best detection and least variance in

225

technical replicates with the CDC N1 and N2 primer-probe sets. Singleplex, probe-based, one-step RT-

226

qPCR (Reliance One-Step Multiplex RT-qPCR Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was performed in this

227

study using the 2019-nCoV Assay-RUO probe/primers mixes for CDC N1 and N2 gene regions (IDT,

228

Kanata, Canada). All utilized primer/probe sets, their sequences and their sources (including PMMV and

229

VSV) are described below in Supplemental Table 3. Reactions were comprised of 1.5 µl of RNA template

230

input, 500 nM each of forward and reverse primers along with 125 nM of the probes in a final reaction

231

volume of 10 μl. Samples were run in triplicate. Using a CFX Connect qPCR thermocycler (Bio-Rad,

232

Hercules, CA), RT was performed at 50ºC, 10 minutes, followed by polymerase activation at 95ºC for 10

233

minutes, and 45 cycles of denaturation, annealing/extension at 95ºC/10 s, then 60ºC/30 s, respectively.

234

Serial dilutions of the viral RNA standard were run on every 96-well PCR plate to produce standard

235

curves used to quantify the copies of SARS-CoV-2 genes. In addition, RT-ddPCR-quantified pooled

236

samples of RNA template were serial diluted and utilized to construct standard curves for PMMV

237

normalization biomarker when RNA signal was normalized by the concentration of PMMV. Additionally,

238

RT-qPCR runs were validated with the use of non-template-controls (NTCs), positive controls, negative

239

controls of pre-COVID 19 pandemic wastewater samples and dilutions.

240

The limit of detection of the RT-qPCR assay was determined for N1 and N2 gene regions, by

241

determining the number of copies per reaction which corresponds to a detection rate of ≥ 95% (<5% false

242

negatives), as recommended by the MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009). Furthermore, samples were

243

discarded if they did not meet the following conditions: i) standard curves with R2 ≥ 0.95, ii)

244

copies/reaction are in linear dynamic range of the curve and iii) primer efficiency between 90%-130%.

245

Furthermore, sample replicates with values greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean of the

246

triplicates were also identified as possible anomalies in this study and discarded.

RT-ddPCR

249

Singleplex, probe-based, one-step RT-ddPCR (1-Step RT-ddPCR Advanced Kit for Probes, Bio-

250

Rad, Hercules, CA) was used for absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 N RNA in wastewaters using the

251

CDC N1, N2 or N3 primer-probe sets, or E RNA expression, using the Sarbeco E-gene primer-probe set

252

(Supplemental Table S3). Primers and probes used in this study were obtained from Integrated DNA

253

Technologies, Inc (IDT, Kanata, Canada) and ThermoFisher. 5 µl of RNA template, 900 nM each of

254

forward and reverse primers and 250 nM of the probe together with the supermix were assembled in a

255

final reaction volume of 20ul. Samples were prepared and run in triplicate. Droplet generation was

256

performed using a QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Droplets were transferred to a new

257

microplate, and PCR was completed in a C1000 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) thermocycler as follows:

258

reverse transcriptase (RT) was performed at 50ºC, 60 minutes, followed by polymerase activation at 95ºC

259

for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing/extension at 94ºC/30 s, then 55ºC/60 s,

260

respectively. The polymerase was deactivated at 98ºC for 10 minutes and droplets stabilized at 4ºC for 30

261

minutes. Droplets were then read using a QX200 droplet reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Positive

262

droplets were called manually, and absolute quantification was performed using Quantasoft Analysis Pro

263

v.1.0 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The limit of detection of the RT-ddPCR assay was determined for N1 and

264

N2 gene regions by determining the number of copies per reaction which corresponds to a detection rate

265

of ≥ 95% (<5% false negatives), as recommended by the MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009).

Statistical analysis

267

In order to test for significant differences between data sets comparing the detection of SARS-

268

CoV-2 in PGS and PCS samples, chi-square and Fisher’s exact test statistical analyses were conducted

269

using GraphPad’s Prism 8.3 software (La Jolla, CA). A student’s t-test was used to test for statistical

270

differences between detection of RNA in RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR assays for PGS and PCS. A student’s

271

t-test and Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed to test for significance and the strength of the

272

correlation between RNA signal and epidemiological data, with a p-value of 0.05 or lower signifying

273

significance.

3. Results & discussion

275

3.1.

Viral RNA recovery efficiency

276

The recovery through the concentration and extraction steps was quantified by spiking samples

277

with serial dilutions of inactivated VSV. The percent recoveries for VSV spiked in PGS and PCS were 8.4

278

± 3.6% and 9.3 ± 4.9%, respectively. The recovery of the surrogate virus through both PCS and PGS

279

concentration and extraction was similar with all spiked-in quantities. Other recent studies investigating

280

surrogate virus recoveries following similar PEG concentration reported variable results for various

281

surrogates; <6% recovery of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (Ye et al., 2016) along with reported recoveries

282

of 33.3 ± 15.6% and 57% of Escherichia virus MS2 (MS2) by Balboa et al. (2020) and Kumar et al.

283

(2020). Other concentration methods have also been used, such as ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation

284

(~20% to 33.5% recovery efficiency of MHV) (Ahmed et al., 2020b; Ye et al., 2016) and aluminum

285

hydroxide adsorption-precipitation (30.4 ± 11.0% recovery of Mengovirus (MGV)) (Medema et al., 2020).

286

It is important to recognize that each study used slightly different methods and viral surrogates, making it

287

difficult to make direct comparisons and generalizations (Lu et al., 2020; Michael-Kordatou et al., 2020).

288

Each surrogate virus will differ in how it interacts with wastewater and this may also be dependent on the

289

characteristics of the wastewater as well as the properties of the virus/fragment that may have very

290

different partitioning/degradation characteristics. It is unclear yet how effective filtration-based

291

concentration techniques perform with high-solid samples, especially with viruses that are highly

292

associated with solids. When analyzing high solids containing samples, such as PGS and PCS, PEG

293

precipitation or other flocculation approaches may be more effective due to an incompatibility of this

294

matrix with ultrafiltration due to possible complication associated with membrane clogging. The

295

advantages of using PGS and PCS, which may have a greater and more consistent RNA signal, should

296

be balanced against the apparent lower recovery of PEG precipitation. Additional studies are needed to

297

develop and assess appropriate and effective methods and surrogates for analysis of SARS-Cov-2 in

298

wastewaters.

Comparison

of

RT-qPCR

and

RT-ddPCR

for

the

detection

and

300

quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

301

This study tested the detection and quantification of RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2

302

RNA signal in PGS and PCS samples. The in vitro transcribed RNA was observed to be reliably detected

303

with primer-probe RT-ddPCR assays to a limit of detection of 5 copies/reaction in both N1 and N2 RT-

304

ddPCR assays. This is consistent with the purported high sensitivity of the digital PCR technology. In vitro

305

transcribed viral RNA was detected to a limit of detection of 2 copies/reaction in both the N1 and N2 RT-

306

qPCR assays, (using the high sensitivity Bio-Rad One-Step Reliance Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)),

307

which was unexpected when comparing to the RT-ddPCR limit of detection. The standard curves utilized

308

for the quantification of different RNA targets for RT-qPCR are as follows: N1 (slope: -3.372, intercept:

309

38.184, R2: 0.972, E: 97.96%), N2 (slope: -3.179, intercept: 37.870, R2: 0.954, E: 106.32%), PMMV

310

(slope: -2.806, intercept: 39.142, R2: 0.968, E: 127.17%) and VSV (slope: -3.518, intercept: 39.846, R2:

311

0.995, E: 92.41%). The standard curves demonstrate good linearity for RT-qPCR in a range between 2 to

60 copies/reaction for N1 and N2, 1.4 × 10 to 3.6 × 10 copies/reaction for PMMV and 1.6 × 10 to 1.6 ×

314

A comparison was performed between the one-step RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR using the same

315

singleplex N1 probe-primer set for the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in solids-rich, low concentration

316

SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal wastewaters (Figure 3). Six PGS samples and five PCS samples were analyzed

317

using RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR. All samples were collected from the two cities during the same low

318

incidence periods (<60 active cases / 100,000 people) case number study period allowing the

319

assessment of quantification and degree of variability in samples with low RNA concentrations. The mean

320

and standard error of the PGS samples analyzed during the same period of low incidence cases are

321

133.4 ± 9.0 and 167.1 ± 25.6 N1 gene copies/100 µL of extracted RNA for RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR,

322

respectively. Meanwhile, the mean and standard error of the PCS samples are 33.5 ± 5.8 and 130.4 ±

323

20.8 gene copies/100 µL of extracted RNA for RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR, respectively (Figure 3).

324

Although a significant decrease in detected copies for PCS samples with RT-ddPCR is observed, it is

While the %CV for PGS samples for the ddPCR assay is lower (16.5%) compared to qPCR (37.5%).

327

The difference in quantification of the PCS samples between the N1 RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR

328

assays suggests inhibition of the reverse transcription and/or polymerase chain reaction of the PCS

329

sample. Given that this assay partitions the sample volume into approximately 1 nL droplets, it’s

330

conceivable that the effective concentration of any RT and/or PCR inhibitors present in the PCS matrix

331

are markedly increased. In contrast, RT-qPCR is performed in a non-partitioned assay volume and may

332

thus be less sensitive to inhibition. The apparent inhibition in ddPCR may also be explained by

333

differences in the reagents used for the RT-ddPCR and RT-qPCR assays. The inhibition

334

resistance/inhibitor removal of the high sensitivity RT-qPCR reagent appears to provide better detection

335

when utilized in pegged sludge matrices. Quantification of two-fold and five-fold dilutions of PCS samples

336

was performed and support the theory that RT-ddPCR was likely inhibited; RT-qPCR shows good

337

quantification of diluted samples while RT-ddPCR suffered from inhibition. These findings contradict the

338

theoretical assumption that RT-ddPCR is less prone to inhibition due to relative insensitivity to differences

339

in amplification efficiencies (due to its binary “all-or-nothing” reporting of amplification) (Salipante and

340

Jerome, 2020). However, at least one report found that undiluted raw wastewater inhibits one-step RT-

341

ddPCR amplification of PMMV RNA to the same degree as the RT-qPCR assay (Rački et al., 2014).

342

Given that RNA in both PGS and PCS samples was at a very low concentration, approaching the limits of

343

detection, it is highly likely that inhibitors in the PCS matrix are responsible for the decreased sensitivity

344

observed in RT-qPCR vs. RT-ddPCR.

345

Of note, it was also attempted in this study to use a commercially available multiplex RT-ddPCR

346

assay that employs primer-probe sets amplifying N1, N2 and N3 regions of the viral N RNA as well as a

347

human transcript (SARS-CoV-2, Bio-Rad). However, it was determined that the discrimination between

348

positive and negative droplets (fluorescence amplitude) was poor, making quantitative analysis

349

impossible. RT-ddPCR has a myriad of theoretical advantages such as absolute quantification that is not

350

dependent on calibration curves, insensitivity to common PCR inhibitors, and the ability to multiplex

351

(Salipante and Jerome, 2020). There is a need to explore this further in future studies and to optimize

352

these methods and quantification techniques for wastewater samples. However, based on the better

353

detection using the current RT-qPCR approach, this method was utilized for the remainder of this study to

354

quantify SARS-CoV-2 in both PGS and PCS solids from the Ottawa and Gatineau WRRFs.

355

3.3.

Detection and variance of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in PGS and PCS

356

In this study, the sensitivity and variability of the RT-qPCR assay in PGS and PCS was compared

357

by investigating the percentage of sample replicates; with replicates including repeated RNA extraction

358

step and PCR quantification samples along with technical triplicates. The limit of detection used in the

359

study for RT-qPCR assays is described above. Replicate runs (24 paired PGS and PCS samples, for a

360

total of 72 technical replicates each) were collected on the same dates across 83 days. PCS samples

361

collected and analyzed at the same time as PGS samples over a 3-month period exhibited stronger

362

percent detection for N1 (92.7% for PCS compared to 79.2% for PGS, p = 0.007) and N2 (90.6% for PCS

363

compared to 82.3% for PGS, p = 0.092) (Figure 4). Variance in percent detection of PCS was shown to

364

be similar for all samples, with coefficients of variation ranging from 29.1% to 31.7%.

365
366

The decreased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in PGS samples could be due to the

367

increased susceptibility of solid particulate matter in this wastewater fraction to daily fluctuations in

368

flowrate and wastewater biochemical characteristics at the WRRFs compared to the sludge samples

369

collected in the primary clarifier stream. In addition, the PGS samples undergo a laboratory settling step

370

in this study to isolate the settled solids from the liquid fraction of the sample. This additional step (which

371

is not applied to the PCS samples) may also contributes to the lower percent detection of SARS-CoV-2

372

signal of these samples due to increased holding times and processing times. As such, the result of this

373

study confirms PCS samples as the high-solids samples that demonstrate an elevated frequency of

374

detection of SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 RNA in municipal wastewaters during decreasing and low incidence

375

of community COVID-19 (Alpaslan-Kocamemi et al., 2020; Balboa et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020a). In

376

addition, it is noted that the viral RNA longitudinal trendline from the PGS samples did not show strong

377

correlation with either the trendline from the PCS samples, or municipal epidemiological data, further

378

supporting PCS sampling as the more robust basis for community COVID-19 monitoring in wastewater

379

solids.

380

3.4.

Variability of normalization biomarkers

381

A multitude of systematic variations exist in molecular wastewater surveillance that makes it

382

challenging to accurately measure SARS-CoV-2 RNA across days, months and years. These include, but

17

383

are not limited to: diurnal variation in plant flow, changes in gross proportions of solids, sample collection

384

and storage, sample processing and sample analysis. Due to these factors, a critical aspect of

385

wastewater epidemiology is sample normalization (Armanious et al., 2016). The necessity to normalize

386

SARS-CoV-2 RNA data has also been identified in more recent studies (Alpaslan-Kocamemi et al., 2020;

387

Balboa et al., 2020; Kaplan et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020). To compare the variability

388

and temporal consistency of biomarkers in this study 8 PCS samples (24 including technical triplicates)

389

were analyzed using RT-qPCR for all three biomarker gene regions: human-specific HF183 Bacteroides

390

16S rRNA, human eukaryotic 18S rRNA and PMMV. All three tested biomarkers were detected in PCS

391

samples with a relatively high level of incidence. While all three RNA targets were detected in PCS

392

samples, it was observed that the distribution of their expression (i.e. quantified through an analysis of

393

variance) of the fecal biomarker PMMV was lower as compared to the 16S and 18S biomarkers in PCS

394

samples (Figure a). The lower variability of PMMV (Ct variance = 1.18) compared to 16S (Ct variance =

395

5.32) and 18S (Ct variance = 5.12) may be due to the relative toughness and stability of the virus in

396

difficult environments (Kitajima et al., 2018). Furthermore, the viral fragments of this biomarker may

397

preferentially adhere to the solids fraction of wastewaters via electrostatic and/or hydrophobic effects

398

(Armanious et al., 2016). Additionally, in order to quantify the variance of the normalization biomarkers in

399

this study, the samples run this comparison were also verified across each surveyed WRRF

400

independently (Figure 5b). The PMMV internal normalization biomarker shows an improved consistency

401

and lower variability (maximum change in Ct; ΔCt = 0.01) between the WRRFs compared to 16S (ΔCt =

402

1.47) and 18S (ΔCt = 2.30); which demonstrates a relative steady signal between differing WRRFs. Due

403

to the consistency of the PMMV fecal biomarker in the PCS samples across 55 days of sampling, PMMV

404

was utilized in this study as a SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 RNA internal control for PCS samples. The low

405

variance of PMMV in PCS, coupled with the use of PMMV as an internal normalization biomarker, was

406

also recently reported by Wu et al. (2020).

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in PCS and correlation with

411

COVID-19 case data

412

As PCS was identified as the solids-rich sample showing the highest RNA detection rate, SARS-

413

CoV-2 RNA was measured in PCS samples from Ottawa and Gatineau WRRFs between April 1st and

414

June 30th, 2020. This sampling period encompasses a decreasing COVID-19 prevalence in two cities

415

(peaks of 56.7 and 57.3 confirmed cases/100K inhabitants in Ottawa and Gatineau respectively) as well

416

as an ensuing period of low prevalence characterized by many days with low new daily reported cases

417

(56.7 → 4.8 and 57.3 → 10.2 confirmed cases/100K inhabitants in Ottawa and Gatineau, respectively). In

418

addition to the technical triplicates of each sample, five of the 14 samples in Ottawa were re-extracted

419

and re-quantified via RT-qPCR. In Gatineau, four of the 8 samples were re-extracted and re-quantified via

420

RT-qPCR. Two distinct but complementary normalization approaches were applied to the observed

421

SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal to account for variations in WRRF wastewater flow, composition and treatment

422

along with temperature, time variations in travel and storage along with human errors in the processing of

423

the samples. In particular, this study normalizes the RNA signal for i) the WRRF mass flux of solids in the

424

sampled primary clarifier stream and ii) the PMMV internal normalization biomarker expression. The

425

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA copies/L and the normalized viral data are benchmarked against and correlated

426

to epidemiological metrics provided by the Ottawa public health agency and the regional public health

427

agency of the city of Gatineau.

428

Three epidemiological data sets based on clinical testing were identified by the local public health

429

agencies as best estimates of COVID-19 prevalence in the two cities: i) daily new cases of COVID-19, ii)

430

active cases of COVID-19 based on an active period of fourteen days, and iii) percent positive of total

431

daily reported clinical COVID-19 tests performed. Two key factors/limitations are noted with respect to

432

these epidemiological data sets shown in this study. Firstly, the testing at the onset of the pandemic

433

(March and April 2020) was variable and low in both cities due to limitations in human resources,

434

laboratory reagents and testing equipment. Hence, the first four weeks of the twelve-week period for

435

which wastewater samples were profiled were subject to variable and lower testing rates per day that

436

likely under-reported both the number of new cases and active cases during this period. Secondly, early

437

testing/screening was less available to the general population in both cities, with testing heavily biased

438

towards hospitalized patients and health care workers. This potentially artificially inflates the percent

439

positive data during the first four weeks of the study, with the effect on the percent positive being likely

440

lesser than the effect of limited testing on the total case numbers.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PCS and correlation with COVID-19 case data

442

The average and standard deviation of technical triplicates and extraction replicates that repeated

443

the concentration, extraction and RT-qPCR steps (shown as error bars in Figures 6 and 7) for the

444

longitudinal viral RNA data sets in this study are plotted along with a percent positive and seven day

445

floating average percent positive epidemiological data sets. Due to limited testing during the first four

446

weeks of the longitudinal study, percent positive was identified as a potentially useful epidemiological

447

metric of COVID-19 prevalence to compare to SARS-CoV-2 RNA measurements in wastewater. As such,

448

this metric is included in Figures 6 and 7 to be benchmarked against the measured SARS-CoV-2 signal.

449

N1 and N2 RNA signal is first expressed in copies/L (of PCS) in this study (Figures 6a and 7a).

450

Equivalent volumes of PCS were PEG concentrated and RNA extracted throughout the sampling period.

451

As expected, and similar to other studies investigating primary sludge and wastewater solids, the raw

452

copies/L data sets for the two cities (Figures 6a and 7a) are relatively noisy with no clear trend observed

453

(Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). The observed concentrations in this study

5
(1.7 x 10 to 7.8 x 10 copies//L (Ottawa) and 6.6 x 10 to 3.8 x 10 copies/L (Gatineau)) are in agreement

455

with other studies investigating SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral signal in PCS. Concentration ranges of 1.7 x 106

456

to 4.6 x 108 copies/L, 1 x 104 to 4 x 104 copies/L and 1.2 x 104 to 4.0 x 104 copies/L have been reported in

457

PCS by Alpaslan-Kocamemi et al., (2020), Balboa et al., (2020) and Peccia et al., (2020b), respectively.

458

Although the N1 and N2 RNA genes show similar longitudinal trends to each other in both the

459

Ottawa and Gatineau WRRFs (Figures 6a and 7a), the inherent variations in signal results in noise,

460

making it difficult to identify real changes in viral signal. In particular, this is seen in the large amplitudes

461

of the standard deviations of many data points in the longitudinal data sets of Ottawa and Gatineau. The

462

noise in the RNA data may be caused by inherent, weather-induced random variations in wastewater

463

biochemical characteristics, solid composition and flowrate (e.g., due to weather, changes in daily

464

household water consumption, etc.) as well as potentially significant effects associated with the collection

465

and transport of the samples and RNA concentration, extraction and analysis. The copies/L longitudinal

466

data in Ottawa and Gatineau clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 quantification in wastewater is

467

inherently noisy and hence normalization of the data should be explored.

468

No significant correlation between N1 and N2 at either the Ottawa WRRF or the Gatineau WRRF

469

is observed across the study time period (Table 2). Strong and significant correlation would have

470

suggested that SARS-CoV-2 RNA might be intact in PCS prior to concentration and extraction, which is

471

not herein observed in this study. Critically, when comparing either N1 or N2 copies/L to each of the

472

epidemiological metrics (daily cases, active cases and percent positive) it appears that in Ottawa no

473

correlation exists between the N1 or N2 RNA copies/L signal and any of the three epidemiological

474

metrics. Meanwhile, in Gatineau, significant correlations exist between the N1 and N2 copies/L signal and

475

epidemiological data sets, with the strongest correlations being observed with the number of active cases

476

(Table 2).

477

Mass flux of primary clarified sludge copies SARS-CoV-2 RNA per day and correlation with

478

COVID-19 case data

479

To correct for systematic variability, the first normalization approach applied in this study is to

480

normalize the N1 and N2 RNA signal to both the mass of the PEG-concentrated solids subject to nucleic

481

acid extraction and also the daily mass flux (mass of volatile solids (VS) solids through the primary

482

clarifier stream per day) at each WRRF (Figures 6b and 7b). This normalization approach results in units

483

of N1 and N2 copies/day as a solids mass flux basis through the WRRF. This normalization approach is

484

intended to compensate for variations in solids concentration and flowrate in the primary clarifier stream

485

at the WRRF due to weather effects, precipitation and infiltration/inflow in the sewers.

486

When comparing longitudinal plots in Ottawa of copies/L (Figure 6a) to copies/d (Figure 6b), the

487

variance of the solids mass flux normalized data set of copies/d does not appear to have been

488

significantly reduced the systemic noise of the copies/L data sets. Similar findings are observed for the

22

489

Gatineau normalized data (Figures 7a and 7b). The substantial noise maintained in the solids mass flux

490

normalized data sets of the two cities and the significantly large standard deviations of longitudinal data

491

points indicates that the fluctuations associated with the solids concentration and flowrate in the primary

492

clarifier stream was likely not a dominant source of the inherent variance in the copies/L data sets.

493

As observed for the copies/L data, the correlation between the N1 and N2 data sets were not

494

significant for either Ottawa or Gatineau. Further, the normalization of the N1 and N2 data for solids mass

495

flux at the WRRFs appear to worsen correlations, with anticorrelations increasing, for all three

496

epidemiological metrics in Ottawa and Gatineau (Table 2). This lack of impact when normalizing

497

operational mass flux of solids at the two WRRFs in this study is likely due to the fact that both WRRFs

498

directly control the flow of the primary clarifier stream at their respective facilities, hence reducing the

499

variation in the flux of solids and in turn minimizing the impact of this variation in WRRF operation on the

500

N1 and N2 signal. Thus, systematic variation in the data sets are likely associated with the sample

501

collection and storage along with RNA concentration, extraction and analysis steps performed in the

502

study.

503

PMMV-normalized SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PCS and correlation with COVID-19 case data

504

PMMV is the most abundant human fecal RNA virus (Kitajima et al., 2018) and has been

505

previously proposed as a biomarker for fecal contamination in water (Hamza et al., 2011; Rosario et al.,

506

2009). PMMV has also more recently been used as an internal reference for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater

507

(Wu et al., 2020). The second normalization approach applied in this study is the division of the RNA N1

508

and N2 copies by PMMV copies. Due to its low variability and high expression in PCS, PMMV was

509

identified as the preferred internal reference of the three tested biomarkers tested in this study.

510

PMMV normalization appears to sufficiently reduce background noise associated with systematic

511

variations in the Ottawa and Gatineau WRRF RNA signals that are possibly associated with the collection

512

and transport of the samples along with the RNA concentration, extraction and analysis steps of PCS

513

RNA signal during decreasing and low incidence periods of COVID-19 disease in this study (Figure 6c

514

and 7c). In particular, the amplitude of the standard deviation associated with each data point in the

23

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.20173062; this version posted August 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

515

longitudinal data sets of Ottawa and Gatineau decreased. This increase in precision ultimately allows for

516

greater distinction between low-incidence data points, hence enabling improved identification of trends in

517

the data sets.

518

Correlation between the PMMV normalized N1 and N2 signals remained insignificant in Ottawa

519

and Gatineau (Table 2). However, this normalization approach also outlines strong, significant and

520

positive correlations between both the N1 gene and the N2 gene with all three epidemiological data sets

521

in Ottawa. The strongest correlation between N1 and N2 PMMV normalized RNA signal is observed with

522

the 7-day rolling average percent positive epidemiological metric in Ottawa. Although the percent positive

523

data during the first four weeks of the study may be biased towards hospitalized patients and health care

524

worker testing, this clinical testing metric in Ottawa is identified as the preferred metric by the public

525

health unit of the city (for the reasons described above). As such, decreasing the systematic variation in

526

the data sets via PMMV normalization establishes a modified trend of the RNA signal and this trend

527

shows the strongest correlation of the RNA signal to city’s identified preferred epidemiological metric.

528

Strong, significant and positive correlation is also shown between the N1 PMMV normalized RNA

529

signal with the active cases epidemiologic metric in Gatineau; while the N2 PMMV normalized signal

530

shows moderate, significant correlation to the active cases. Although the PMMV normalized Gatineau

531

RNA signal data shows agreement with the active cases epidemiological metric, results were varied when

532

correlated to daily cases and 7-day rolling average percent positive. The strongest correlation observed in

533

this study for the Gatineau RNA signal and the epidemiological metrics of the City exists between both

534

the N1 and N2 copies/L RNA signal and the active cases. It is also noted that the longitudinal trends in N1

535

and N2 PMMV signals in Gatineau are similar to those in Ottawa. This is expected as the two cities are

536

geographically close with many inhabitants travelling across bridges between the cities. The observed

537

differences in correlations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in wastewater to clinical testing metrics in

538

the two neighboring cities of this study is illustrative of the challenges associated with interpreting and

539

correlating RNA signal acquired from distinct WRRFs to clinical testing metrics acquired from distinct

540

health agencies.

4. Conclusion

559

This study is the first investigation and detection of SARS-CoV-2 trends in wastewater in Canada.

560

It identifies primary clarified sludge as a preferred solids-rich sample compared to post grit solids for the

561

detection of SARS-CoV-2 signal during decreasing and low incidence of viral load in communities. Based

562

on the reagents used in this study, RT-qPCR shows superior quantification of SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2

563

gene signal in primary clarified sludge compared to RT-ddPCR. Finally, it is demonstrated that PMMV is a

564

potential effective normalization biomarker for RNA signal to reduce noise inherent to the WRRF

565

operation along with the sampling, transport and processing of the samples. The normalization of N1 and

566

N2 SARS-CoV-2 signal using PMMV enables strong correlation to epidemiological metrics in two

567

surveyed WRRFs across decreasing and low-incidence cases of COVID-19.
