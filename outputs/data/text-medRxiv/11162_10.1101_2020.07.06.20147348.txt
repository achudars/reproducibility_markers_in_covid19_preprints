Abstract

To estimate the percentage of individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) over time in the community in England and to quantify risk factors.
Objective

Repeated cross-sectional surveys of population-representative households with longitudinal
follow-up if consent given.
Design

Setting

England.

34,992 Individuals aged 2 years and over from 16,722 private residential households.
Data were collected in a pilot phase of the survey between 26 April and 28 June 2020.
Participants

Percentage of individuals in the community testing positive for SARS-CoV-2
RNA using throat and nose swabs. Individuals were asked about any symptoms and potential risk
factors.
Main outcome measures

The percentage of people in private-residential households testing positive for SARS-CoV-2
reduced from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on 26 April to 0.08% (95% CrI 0.05%
to 0.12%) on 28 June, although the prevalence stabilised near the end of the pilot. Factors associated
with an increased risk of testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact (relative
exposure (RE) 4.06, 95% CrI 2.42 to 6.77)), working outside the home (RE 2.49, 95% CrI 1.39 to 4.45),
and having had contact with a hospital (RE 2.20, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.16 for having been to a hospital
individually and RE 1.95, 95% CrI 0.81 to 4.09 for a household member having been to a hospital). In
133 visits where individuals tested positive, 82 (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) reported no symptoms,
stably over time.
Results

Conclusion

The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020.
Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Working outside your home
was an important risk factor, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community
will be essential for early detection of increases in infections following return to work and other
relaxations of control measures.

What is already known on this topic

-

-

Unprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely
implemented to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Previous mass surveillance has been based on data sources such as hospital admission,
deaths or self-reported symptoms that do not measure community prevalence of virus
directly.
Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall
population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date
information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive.

The percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020 from around one in three
300 to around one in a thousand.
Risk factors for testing positive included having a job with direct patient contact, having had
(indirect) contact with a hospital in the past 2 weeks, and working outside your home.
Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported and the percentage of
individuals with a positive test that reported no symptoms was stable over time.

Introduction

Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started causing clusters of
severe respiratory illness in Wuhan, China, in late 2019,1 the virus has had a drastic impact
worldwide. As of 28 June, there have been 9.8 million confirmed cases reported and almost 496,000
reported deaths.2 Unprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely
implemented to contain the spread of the virus in a, likely successful,3-5 attempt to prevent the
collapse of healthcare systems and even larger numbers of deaths among those infected with SARSCoV-2. Although such measures are important for control of the pandemic, they also affect the
economy, unemployment rates, and global supply-chains.6,7 While an uncontrolled epidemic has
potentially even more drastic consequences,6 politicians have to continuously make the difficult
decision between continuing strict control measures or relaxing them in some way that would be
safe enough in medical terms yet beneficial more broadly across society.
Policy makers and expert groups advising governments about the continued need for social
distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely
on accurate and up-to-date information about the prevalence and incidence of people testing
positive for COVID-19. In England, a five-level alert system has been introduced, with levels guiding
lockdown, social distancing, and relaxation of restrictions decisions.8 The levels are largely
determined by the effective reproduction number (R) and the number of confirmed cases at any one
time.
Here we report the results from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) Coronavirus Infection Survey
(CIS) Pilot. This national survey, collecting throat and nose swabs and accompanying data from
individuals in households across England, estimates the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in
the community in England, and hence directly informs decisions about continued need or relaxation
of COVID-19 related control measures.
Methods

Data were collected between 26 April and 28 June 2020 from individuals that recently took part in
the Labour Force Survey or another online survey from the ONS, had consented to be approached for
future research, and provided written informed consent to participate in the CIS. At the start of the
pilot study, approximately 20,000 households were invited to take part, anticipating approximately
21,000 participants from approximately 10,000 households. After 5 weeks, further households were
approached on a weekly basis. As of 28 June, about 45,165 households had been invited to take part,
of which approximately 18,894 households were enrolled (not yet all providing data). Parents/carers
provided written informed consent for those under 16 years; those aged 10-15 years provided
written assent. Only individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households were eligible for
inclusion in the survey, meaning that people in care homes, other communal establishments and
hospitals are not captured. Because of their selection by ONS for participation in previous studies,
households were broadly representative of England. If one or more individuals from a household
agreed to participate, a visit by a study worker was arranged and, after signing consent forms,
individuals were asked about any symptoms and contacts, together with information about their
gender, age, ethnicity and occupation. The study worker provided instructions on how to self-swab
the nose and throat, which has been shown to be comparable or even more sensitive than swabs
performed by healthcare workers.9 Parents/carers took swabs from children under 12 years old. The
nose and throat self-swabs were couriered directly to the National Biosample Centre at Milton
Keynes, where the samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as part of the national testing programme.10 After the first visit,

participants were asked whether they were willing to participate in further follow-up visits: every
week for the first 5 weeks of the study, and then monthly for a period of 12 months in total.
Therefore, longitudinal follow-up was available for a subsample of included participants.
The project has been reviewed and given ethical approval by South Central - Berkshire B Research
Ethics Committee (20/SC/0195).

Trend in number of positive tests over time
We analysed the proportion of the private-residential population testing positive for COVID-19 from
nose and throat swabs over time using dynamic Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP).
MRP is an effective method for adjusting a survey sample to be more representative of the
population for a set of key (socio)demographic and geographic variables. The method was introduced
by Gelman and Little11 and has subsequently been further developed, including a dynamic approach
that allows assessment of changes over time using all the available data at once.12 MRP is
increasingly used to make survey samples more representative of (sub)populations and has recently
been adopted by the Center of Disease Control (CDC) to provide model-based estimates of the
prevalence of diseases at both national level as well as smaller geographical areas in the United
States (https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/methodology.htm). In a recent simulation study MRP was
found to be superior in terms of accuracy and precision at both the national and regional levels
compared to classical survey weighted and unweighted approaches.13
MRP generally consists of two steps. First, a multilevel regression model is used to generate the
outcome of interest as a function of (socio)demographic and geographic variables. Next, the resulting
outcome estimates for each demographic-geographic respondent type are poststratified (weighted)
by the percentage of each type in the actual overall population.11
We first used a Bayesian multilevel generalised additive regression model to model the swab test
result (positive/negative) as a function of age, sex, time and region. Because there were very few
missing values (≤1%) in these factors, we restricted all analyses to observations with non-missing
data. A complementary log-log link was used due to the ability to interpret regression coefficients as
arising from an infection process with varying levels of exposure (see Supplementary File 1).14 MRP
models with random effects for individual participant and/or household nested within region did not
converge, meaning that the resulting models could not take into account correlation within
individuals or household. However, a model with only one participant sampled from each household
gave similar results with somewhat wider 95% credible intervals mainly due to the halved sample size
(Supplementary File 1, Fig S1). Time, measured in days since the start of the study (26 April 2020),
was modelled using thin plate splines. We set k, the number of basis functions, to five to control the
smoothness of the fitted function.15 Because variation in trends over time was a key question, we
allowed the effect of time to vary by region.
Subsequently, we poststratified the resulting positivity estimates for each demographic-geographic
respondent type by the percentage of each type in the overall population and in each region. The
post-stratification table was created based on 2011 Census data with age categorised into 5 agecategories (2-11, 12-19, 20-49, 50-69, 70+), and 9 regions within England (North East, North West,
Yorkshire and The Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South East,
South West). This analysis was performed using the rstanarm package in R version 3.6.1.16

To assess to what extent the prevalence was increasing, decreasing or stabilising we estimated the
instantaneous growth rates for each region. The growth rate r(t) was estimated using the first and
second derivative of the time smoother (s(t), the thin plate spline) from the Bayesian regression with
complementary log-log link, following the following formula (derived in Supplementary File 1):

where an over-dot indicates the first derivative and a double over-dot indicates the second
derivative. The associated doubling time (or halving time in case of decreasing growth rate) is then:

Associations between variables and testing positive
To assess whether particular subgroups are more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA we
performed an additional analysis including variables on which we did not post-stratify: work location
(working from home, working outside of your home, working from home and working outside of
your home, or not applicable), having a job in healthcare or social care that was directly involved
with patients/care-home residents , ethnicity (white, Asian, black, mixed, other), household size, and
number of children in household (with the latter two variables both obtained from previous
underlying ONS surveys). Given the short timescale of the study, and the fact that questions were not
always asked at every visit we carried non-missing data forwards and backwards to adjacent visits
with missing data. After this, there were very few missing values (≤1%), so we again we restricted all
analyses to observations with non-missing data only. We used the same model as for the dynamic
MRP but in working-aged individuals only (16-74 years inclusive as defined in the Labour Force
Survey) with these additional variables included as fixed covariates and age modelled as a continuous
variable, using a thin-plate spline (again with k=5), instead of a categorical variable.
Since 8 May 2020 we also collected information on contact with hospitals and care homes in the past
2 weeks. To assess whether having been in the hospital or in a care home was associated with an
increased risk of testing positive, we performed another regression also including these two
additional variables (participant has had contact; participant has not had contact but someone else in
their household has; no one in the household).
In addition, for strong risk factors with ≥5 positives in each category we evaluated whether there
were different trends over time within each category by including an interaction between time and
the respective variables.

Presence of symptoms among those testing positive
The percentage of participants reporting any symptoms on the day the swab was taken (‘at visit’) or
at the visit the week before or after (‘around visit’) was also evaluated for positive and negative tests.
Credible intervals for crude proportions were estimated using a Beta(1,1) prior, acknowledging the
wide range of estimates of the percentage of infected persons that is asymptomatic in the
literature.17 To assess the impact of false-positive tests on individuals testing positive without
reporting any symptoms, we assessed whether variables that had a clear positive association with
testing positive had no or a very small effect on the risk of testing positive while being asymptomatic.
This was done by fitting a Bayesian ordinal (adjacent category family) regression model with the
following outcomes: (1) negative test; (2) positive test and no reported symptoms; and (3) positive
test and reported symptoms. The model allowed for category-specific effects for the variables with

clear evidence of an effect on a positive test (regardless of presence of symptoms). This ordinal
regression model was fitted using the brms package in R version 3.6.1.18 In addition, we evaluated
whether the proportion of individuals reporting no symptoms around the visit was stable over time
using a Bayesian generalised additive model with a complementary log-log link and time as the only
covariate. If false positives were playing an important role in our study, the percentage of individuals
not reporting symptoms among those testing positive should increase when the true prevalence is
declining.

Incidence
The daily incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among those at risk – i.e. not having tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 before during the study period – was calculated between 12 May and 28
June. We excluded the period before 12 May as for the first 2 weeks of follow-up the first time that
an individual could be observed to have become positive was at their first visit (scheduled 7 days
after enrolment) and recruitment increased substantially over this period. Given the low number of
incident cases a simple Bayesian generalised additive Poisson model with the number of persons at
risk on each day as an offset without any covariates other than time was used and no poststratification was used to adjust for potential unrepresentativeness. The effect of time was modelled
using a thin-plate spline (k=5).

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor were they
involved in developing plans for design or implementation of the pilot study. No patients were asked
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. Test results are communicated to patients via
their General Practitioner. Results are being disseminated to relevant patient communities on an
ongoing basis through news media (https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/results &
https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseas
es/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases).
Results

Figure 1 shows the population representativeness of our underlying survey sample of 34,992
individuals from 16,722 households recruited and providing data from 26 April to 28 June 2020,
inclusive in terms of age, sex, and region. Individuals from London and children and younger adults
were somewhat underrepresented in our sample, while individuals from all other regions were
slightly overrepresented with a more pronounced overrepresentation of those aged 50 years or
older. The percentage of males in the survey was very similar to the percentage in the general
population of England.
Overall 4,443 (13%) individuals contributed only a single test result to the analysis, with the
remaining participants contributing a median of 4 (interquartile range 2 to 5). In total results were
available from 130,705 tests of nose and throat swabs, of which 134 (0.10%) were positive overall
from 112 individuals in 96 households (including repeated positives in some individuals).
After making our results representative of the population by accounting for age, sex, and region
using MRP, we observed a decline in the percentage of individuals in England testing positive over
time (Figure 2). Specifically, this declined from 0.32% (95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19% to 0.52%) on
7

26 April 2020 (the first day of the survey) to 0.08 (95% CrI 0.05 to 0.12) on 28 June 2020.
Extrapolating to the number of inhabitants in England, this corresponds to 175,000 (95% CrI 105,000
to 284,000) positives on 26 April and 41,000 (95% CrI 26,000 to 64,000) positives on 28 June in
England.
The change over time varied somewhat in different regions (Figure 2). For example, the probability
that the prevalence in the East Midlands was higher than the average in England on the 28th of June
(0.08%) was 88%. However, the credible intervals were wide for most trends within regions,
especially where positivity rates seemed to follow a non-linear trend. Figure 3 shows the growth
rates over time for England as a whole and the 9 regions. For England as a whole the growth rate was
generally negative, consistent with the observed decline in positivity, although it appeared to be
levelling off near the end of the study period.
We also evaluated to what extent different factors, including work-related factors, were associated
with increased probability of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) in individuals aged 16 to 74
years old. There was clear evidence that having a job which involved direct contact with patients and
working outside of the home in general was associated with an increased risk of testing positive
(Table 1). In addition, individuals that indicated that the work location was not applicable (including
not working, retired, students) had a higher risk than those that worked from home. Individuals from
ethnicities other than Asian, black, white or mixed also tested positive more frequently although
uncertainty was high in this small group which could not be split further. Furthermore, these cases
were strongly clustered within households. For the remaining factors there was no clear evidence
that there was a positive or negative association with testing positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2
viral RNA, although individuals that directly work with residents in nursing homes or residential care
homes may also have an increased risk (relative exposure (RE) 2.35, 95% CrI 0.85 to 5.27). Within this
population of working age, there was no evidence of an effect of age after accounting for other
variables (Supplementary File 1, Fig S2). Analyses using an additional random intercept per individual
showed similar results, with the same factors identified as being clear predictors of test positivity
(Supplementary File 2).
An additional analysis on more recent data including information on contact with hospitals or care
homes in the previous two weeks showed that having had hospital contact was associated with
testing positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (RE 2.18, 95% CrI 1.09 to 4.18). Positive
tests were also higher if another member of the household had hospital contact but not the person
providing the swab themselves (RE 1.99, 95% CrI 0.86 to 4.13). There was no evidence that recent
direct or indirect contact with a care home was associated with risk (RE 0.77, 95% CrI 0.18 to 2.79 for
having had contact individually and RE 0.48, 95% CrI 0.10 to 1.88 for a household member).
A sensitivity analysis evaluating whether the risk of testing positive declined less in certain riskgroups showed that there was a consistent decline across the board (Supplementary File 1, Fig S3S4).

Positive tests with and without reported symptoms
In total, 98 out of 133 (73%, 95% CrI 66% to 81%) visits where individuals had a positive test reported
no symptoms on the day the swab was taken, decreasing to 82 positive tests (61%, 95% CrI 53% to
69%) when also including symptoms at visits the week before and after testing positive. Among the
subgroup of individuals of working-age (16-74 years old), 66 out of 111 (59%, 95% CrI 50% to 68%)
positive tests were obtained from individuals reporting no symptoms around the test. Given the low

number of positives that also experienced symptoms, we only included work location, having a job
involving direct contact with patients, having a job involving direct contact with care home residents,
and region in a multivariable Bayesian ordinal regression model allowing for different effects of
factors on the ordinal outcome. Having a job involving direct contact with patients and working
outside of the home were both associated with an increased risk of testing positive without reporting
symptoms (RE 3.95, 95% CrI 2.13 to 7.06 and 2.43, 95% CrI 1.31 to 4.52 respectively). There was no
clear evidence that these associations were stronger for symptomatic than for asymptomatic
infections (RE 1.01, 95% CrI 0.47 to 2.06 and RE 1.25, 95% CrI 0.53 to 3.21, respectively). There were
insufficient number of positive tests among people having a job involving direct contact with care
home residents to draw conclusions about a difference in effect on asymptomatic infection and
symptomatic infections (RE 1.33, 95% CrI 0.33 to 4.07 and RE 2.18 95% CrI 0.77 to 5.19,
respectively).
The percentage of participants reporting symptoms among individuals testing positive for the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA remained stable throughout the study period, despite a clear
decline in the total number of positives (Supplementary File 1, Figure S5).

Incidence of positive tests
The incidence of new positive tests among those still at risk appeared to decline initially with a
stabilisation or slight increase in new cases near the end of the pilot study (Figure 4). However, 95%
credible intervals were wide. Extrapolating to the number of inhabitants in England – ignoring the
negligible small fraction of our sample was considered not at risk due to a previous positive test
during the survey - this corresponds to 3,400 (95% CrI 1,500 to 6700) new positives per day in
England on 28 June 2020.

Discussion

Here we demonstrate a reduction in the percentage of people in private-residential households in
the community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 26 April and 28 June 2020,
suggesting that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 had its intended effect.19 Mechanistic
dynamic transmission models, calibrated to our nationally and regionally representative estimates of
infections, can be used to explicitly estimate the impact of different policy interventions and
behaviour changes on the observed and forecasted future trends of the epidemic. As such, our
estimates have been regularly updated and shared with the UK Government and Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies (SAGE) sub-group Scientific Pandemic Influenza sub-group on Modelling (SPIM) to directly inform decisions about potential changes to the current alert level or relaxation of
certain restrictions. However, our survey is not intended to disentangle what interventions or
voluntary behaviour changes directly underly any trends.
Notably, we found that a substantial proportion (61%, 95% CrI 53% to 69%) of individuals that tested
positive did not report any symptoms on the day of the visit or at visits one week before or after the
swab was taken.
Factors associated with an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and reasonable
tight 95% credible intervals included working outside the home, having a job with direct patient
contact, and having had (indirect) contact with a hospital in the previous two weeks. Because there
were relatively few positive cases, we may not have found evidence of an effect for other factors that
make a person truly more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2. For example, with increasing
sample size and/or an increase in the prevalence or using a more informative prior based on external
evidence,20 it is likely that the evidence of an increased risk among individuals that directly work with
residents in nursing homes or residential care homes would have become more apparent (RE 2.35,
95% CrI 0.85 to 5.27 using the current data). Other studies, including the Vivaldi study from the
England, have shown that having a resident-facing job likely substantially increases the risk of
acquiring an infection when the virus is circulating in a care home.20,21
Comparison with other studies

Our finding of a temporal reduction in the percentage of people in the community infected with
COVID-19 in England is consistent with reductions observed in the weekly number of excess deaths in
the UK recorded by ONS during the same period.22 Similarly, the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England
Surveillance System (CHESS) indicates that during our study period the number of COVID-19 hospital
admissions also decreased.23 An important advantage of our current study is that it is based on a
representative sample of the population, with further correction for potential nonrepresentativeness using MRP. A population-based sample may enable earlier detection of increases
and decreases in the epidemic not purely driven by hospital or care home outbreaks than
surveillance based on hospitalisations and deaths, which inevitably suffers from a lag between
acquiring an infection in the community and potential subsequent hospitalisation and/or death.
Furthermore, our national survey is more capable of detecting potential increases in the community
among individuals that are less likely to require hospital admission, but potentially still able to
contribute to spread of the virus, including if asymptomatic.24
There are a few other studies that aimed to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
general population. In a study from Vo, an Italian town with a population of 3275 individuals, Lavezzo
et al. surveyed 85.9% and 71.5% of the inhabitants at the start and end of lockdown of the town
respectively, with an initial infection prevalence of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 3.3%)
and 1.2% (95% CI 0.8 to 1.8%) 14 days later.25 The percentage of those who tested positive that did

not report any symptoms was 41.0% (95% CI 29.7 to 53.2%) in the first survey and 44.8% (95% CI
26.5 to 64.3%) in the second survey.
As part of a larger study from Iceland, a randomly selected sample of inhabitants aged between 20
and 70 years of age were invited to participate in a survey.26 By 4 April, 2283 (33.7%) of those invited
had participated, with 13 testing positive (0.6%; 95% CI 0.3% to 1.0% estimated using Wilson score
intervals based on numbers reported in the paper). However, it is unclear to what extent the
participation rate led to a sample that was not representative of the Icelandic population and no
correction for population representativeness was performed. Among a larger sample, including
participants recruited via an open invitation, which may bias the sample towards people with
symptoms, 57% of individuals testing positive reported having symptoms, although 29% of
individuals testing negative also reported having symptoms.
While the studies from Iceland and Vo found that around 40-45% of those with a positive test did not
report any symptoms,25,26 this percentage is higher in our study, being 59% (50% to 68%) among
those 16-74 years old. This may be partly due to differences in respondents, such as no children
being included in the study from Iceland, chance (given the wide confidence and credible intervals in
all studies), differences in definitions of symptoms, over/under-reporting of symptoms or false
positive tests. While false-positives may be a concern with a low prevalence - potentially leading to
an overestimation of the percentage of truly infected persons that are asymptomatic - the low
number of positive tests in our study overall is also reassuring since it indicates that the specificity of
the test is very high. Even in a purely hypothetical situation that the virus is not circulating, a test
specificity of 99.9% would be associated with an expected number of positive tests that is
approximately equal to what we observed over the entire study period.
Furthermore, the strong associations between expected risk factors, such as directly working with
patients, and test positivity in combination with no reported symptoms, together with declining
positivity rates over time in those reporting and not reporting symptoms, suggest that there may
truly be more asymptomatic cases than reported in some other studies.17 A recent meta-analysis of
studies focusing on close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases suggested that only 15% (95% CI 12%
to 18%) of infected individuals are asymptomatic.17 However, by informing participants that they
were recently in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, individuals may be more likely to
think that they have experienced symptoms, resulting in recall bias and overestimating the true
prevalence of symptoms among a representative sample of infected persons. Although we may have
underestimated the true prevalence of symptoms among SARS-CoV-2 cases in the community, partly
due to asking about current symptoms at weekly visits (meaning that very transient symptoms only
occurring between visits would have been missed), our study adds to the growing evidence that a
substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 in the community may be asymptomatic. For example, our
estimate aligns with a large study from Italy which recently reported that that 69% (95% CI 67% to
71%) of individuals that test positive do not develop symptoms.27

Limitations of this study

An important limitation of this study is that the number of people in the community that test positive
is low, limiting power. From a public health perspective this is positive; however it also means that
the multilevel regression model used in our analyses was not able to incorporate likely correlation
within households, and that the uncertainty around estimates is relatively large. However, randomly
selecting one individual per household gave similar results with somewhat wider credible intervals
owing to the halved sample size, suggesting within household clustering is not having a large impact

on our results. The data reported here is from the pilot phase of our study, and more data, and hence
more positive tests in absolute terms, are expected in future waves of the survey. If a second wave of
infections occurs in the coming months, particularly in the absence of an effective vaccine, models
including more factors and accounting for correlation between observations from the same
household would have greater power to delineate the risk of different subgroups of the population
acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection.
A second limitation is that, in the absence of a true gold standard, we do not know the test sensitivity
and specificity, making it difficult to assess what the true prevalence is. From i) the low number of
positive tests overall, ii) the finding that risk factors for testing positive regardless of symptoms were
(equally) strong for testing positive while reporting no symptoms, and iii) the observation that the
percentage of individuals reporting no symptoms among those testing positive remained stable over
time despite substantial declines in the overall number of positives, we can conclude that the
specificity must be very close to 100% and the number of false positives in our sample is likely low.
However, the data cannot inform about the test sensitivity without providing a very informative prior
on the true prevalence.28 Given the low number of positives, even a low sensitivity of 60%
(incorporating both test performance and potentially imperfect self-swabbing) and perfect specificity
would mean that the estimated prevalence would still have declined from 0.54% on 26 April to 0.13%
on 28 June 2020.
Conclusions

The percentage of individuals from the community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly
declined between 26 April and 28 June 2020, although the decline appears to be levelling off near
the end of this period. This adds to the increasing body of empirical evidence and theoretical models
that suggest that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 had its intended effect. Important risk
factors for testing positive were having a job with direct contact with patients and working outside
the home more generally, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting
symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important
for potential early detection of increases in infections due to return to work and other relaxations of
control measures. The planned increase in survey sample size, and extensions to other areas of the
UK, will likely facilitate exploration of important questions such as what are the trends in prevalence
and incidence in smaller geographical areas and what specific types of jobs and other factors make
individuals from the community more likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2.
