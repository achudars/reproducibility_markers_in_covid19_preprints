Abstract
objectives: COVID-19 began spreading widely in China in January 2020. Outpatient “Fever
Clinics” (FCs), instituted during the SARS epidemic in 2003 were upgraded to provide
COVID-19 screening and prevention attached to large tertiary hospitals. We sought to analyze the
effect of upgraded FCs to detecting COVID-19 at our institution.

：

Design A population-based cross-sectional study.
Participants

：A total of 6,365 patients were screened in the FC.

The FC of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) was upgraded on
January 20, 2020. We performed a retrospective study of patients presenting to the FC between
December 12, 2019 to February 29, 2020, covering a period of 40 days before and after upgrading
the FC. All necessary data, including baseline patient information, diagnoses, follow-up
conditions for critical patients, transfer information between the FC and emergency department
(ED) were collected and analyzed.
Results: 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened
before January 21, 2020, while 3,453 were screened afterwards. Screening results showed that
upper respiratory infection was the major disease associated with fever. Compared to before the
outbreak, patients transferred from the FC to ED decreased significantly [39.21% vs 15.75%,
p<0.001] and tended to spend more time in the FC [55 vs 203mins, p<0.001]. For critically-ill
patients waiting for a screening result, the total length of stay in the FC was 22mins before the
outbreak, compared to 442mins after the outbreak (p< 0.001). The number of in-hospital deaths of
critical-care patients seen first in the FC was 9 of 29 patients before the outbreak and 21 of 38
after (p<0.050). Nineteen COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the FC, but no other patients or
medical care providers were cross-infected.
Conclusion: The work-load of the FC increased after the COVID-19 outbreak and effectively

Introduction
Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province at the end of 2019[1], and
cases are now rapidly spreading worldwide [2] . Currently, controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2
is of primary concern [3]. The main manifestations of this disease include acute fever, cough and

dyspnea [4], thus emergency departments (EDs) have become the primary facilities providing
initial diagnoses and medical care for potential COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, as the virus
spreads widely, crowded patients in EDs face a high risk of cross-infection [5,6]. In mainland China,
outpatient “fever clinics” (FCs), affiliated to the ED, are designed to help separate potentially
infectious from non-infectious patients [7]. FCs were started at the suggestion of National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China as early as 2003 during the SARS outbreak in
China Even after the SARS event, FCs were still preserved as a location near EDs for early
identification and isolation of potentially infectious patients [8]. Therefore, few suspected patients
were managed in emergency department[9]. However, between SARS in 2003 and the current
COVID-19 outbreak, the FC system has seen few similar stresses and few reports have emerged
about this potentially key element of hospital infection-prevention infrastructure.

FC upgrade after the COVID-19 outbreak
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, four doctors were allocated to the FC where influenza A and B
were screened for every patient suffering from both fever and respiratory symptoms. The FC was
also tasked with excluding eruptive infectious diseases (e.g. measles, rubella, and varicella).
Patients with infectious diseases received initial therapy in the FC, and then were transferred to
inpatient isolation wards if needed; other patients were transferred to the ED. After the COVID-19
outbreak, as many as twelve doctors wearing “grade-3” isolation gowns worked in the FC[10]. Two
consulting rooms were added to supplement the original single-room. The number of medical care
providers providing in-person coverage every 24 hours increased from two to nine every 24 hours,
while nursing staff increased from nine to 15 every 24 hours. Rescue equipment such as
endotracheal intubation tools, central venous catheters, noninvasive and invasive ventilator
machines, high-flow oxygen therapy devices and bedside ultrasound were added or expanded.
All patients with either fever or respiratory symptoms, no matter with or without a history of
Covid-19 exposure, were mandated to go through FC triage (see Figure 1). Each patient was
required to wear a mask on arrival to the FC and was allocated to different regions according to
their triage history and clinical severity (see Figure 1). FC took responsibility for screening
SARS-COV-2, in addition to influenza and eruptive diseases noted above. All acquired nucleic
acid samples were tested by two independent laboratories that had been authorized by the Beijing
Municipal Health Commission. Only “double negative” results was defined as a negative result
for the patient. In addition to identification, there were specialized doctors in charge of suspected
patients, critical patients and common patients, respectively. Negative pressure isolation wards
with complete sets of resuscitation equipment were readied for any critical patients. Once the
screening tests were reported, confirmed patients would be transferred to specialized hospitals
whereas others who needed further treatment were transferred into the ED (see Figure 2).
Methods
Data collection

We collected data from all patients who presented to the FC of PUMCH 40 days before the
upgrade in the FC (December 12, 2019 to January 20, 2020), and for 40 days after the upgrade
from January 21 to February 29, 2020. The FC upgrade date (January 20, 2020) was also the

official date Covid-19 was declared an “outbreak” in Beijing. We included all critically ill patients
during this period who presented to the FC and then were transferred to the ED. The data were
collected from patients’ medical records and their registration information at the time of
presentation. Patients’ clinical condition, primary diagnoses, time of registration (FC and,
potentially, ED), as well as the duration of consultation at each visit were obtained.
Critically ill patients were identified according to the following criteria: (1) patients transferred to
resuscitation rooms in the ED from the FC after initial screening and initial treatment; (2)
APACHE II score ≥8; (3) patients who were ruled out the possibility of COVID-19 pneumonia[11].
Critically ill patients’ prognoses and treatment results were documented by medical records, as
well as any changes in patients’ condition within seven days following initial presentation to the
FC (improvement, non-improvement or death).
Patient and Public Involvement:
This was a restrospective study,we collected medical information of all involved patients from
electronic information system.The patients did not involve in the recruitment to and conduct of
the study, as well as not join in designing.
Statistics
Statistical Package for Social Sciences 24.0 software (IBM Corp., Aramonk, NY, USA) was used for
statistical analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to determine the normal distribution of
variables. Variables with normal distribution are shown as a mean (±SD). T-tests were used for
variables that followed normal distribution.. Data that did not follow normal distribution was shown as a
median (25%-75%) and analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact
tests were used for enumeration data. P-values less than 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical
significance.
Results

Patient Characteristics and Disease Etiologies
In total, 6,365 patients were screened in the FC, among whom 2,192 patients were screened
before the outbreak, and 3,453 patients were screened after the outbreak was declared and the FC
upgraded on January 20, 2020. There was no statistical difference in sex ratio between the two
groups, but a significant difference in age was seen (p=0.001). The most common disease found
in the FC was an upper respiratory infection, followed by an abdomino-pelvic infection and
pneumonia (see Table 1).
FC to ED transfer statistics before and after the COVID-19 outbreak
The number of registered patients who presented first to the FC and were then transferred to the
ED before and after the outbreak was 1,142 and 544, respectively. There was no statistical
difference in the sex ratio or age of patients between these two groups (p>0.05). 1,083 (94.84%)
of cases before the outbreak took less than 24 hours to transfer between the FC and ED. After the
outbreak, 482 cases met this benchmark (p<0.001). Meanwhile, the treatment time in the FC grew
significantly longer compared to before the outbreak (p<0.001) (see Table 2).

Critically ill patients
69 critically ill patients were included in our analysis, and two patients were excluded due to an
APACHE II score < 8 points. 29 and 38 patients presented, respectively, at the FC before and after
the COVID-19 outbreak. The ratio of male to female patients was 1.23:1, average age was 61
(44,76). There was no significant difference in the sex ratio or age of patients between the two
groups (p>0.05). There was also no significant difference in the severity of disease between the
two groups when examining the respective APACHE II scores (16.1±6.67 vs 18.74±6.72 (p>0.05).
Patients with septic shock and pneumonia combined with respiratory failure accounted for most
diagnoses. The number of in-hospital deaths within seven days for critically ill patients initially
presenting to the FC was 9 of 29 and 21 of 38 before and after the outbreak, respectively (p<0.05)
(see Table 3).
Length of stay in FC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak
The total length of stay in the FC was 22 (12,47) mins before the outbreak, compared with 442
(374,636) mins after the outbreak (p<0.001). While the total length of stay in the resuscitation
rooms of the ED lengthened from 22 (7,59) hours to 48 (21,96) hours after the outbreak (p<0.001)
(see Table 4).
Most commonly provided treatments in the FC were: antibiotics, antiarrhythmic drugs,
antihypertensive drugs, and antiplatelet drugs. Common supportive treatments included: nasal
catheter oxygen, non-invasive/invasive ventilation, fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, intracranial
pressure reduction, and diuretic drugs. Initial treatment times are shown in Table 4.
Strengths and limitations

This study had several limitations. It was a restrospective study at a single center and carries the
associated weaknesses of such study methodologies. Still, given the seriousness of the global fight
against COVID-19, the lessons learned through the expansion of the FC and its relationship to the
ED and ED patient flow are important concerns for global discussion. Future studies should
examine the effects of having dedicated FC associated with ED, including the degree of
integration with the ED vs. the rest of the hospital.
Discussion

COVID-19 is a deadly new respiratory infectious disease. This widely spreading disease became
a notifiable infectious disease starting on January 20, 2020 per the National Health Commission
of the People’s Republic of China. Starting on January 20, the Beijing Municipal Government
initiated a level-1 (highest) public health response to prevent the spread of the disease[12]. PUMCH
upgraded the FC that same day to enhance the screening and treatment of potential COVID-19
patients. In this study, we reviewed the details of the FC in the 40 days before and after the
COVID-19 outbreak. We found that after the outbreak, more patients received treatment in FC,
critically ill patients received initial rescue management in the FC, and, most importantly, no

confirmed COVID-19 patients were transferred to the ED and no other patients, doctors or nurses
were infected in the hospital. This FC upgrate strategy seemed to successfully prevent COVID-19
from spreading.
According to our data, upper respiratory infections were the major disease seen in the FC both
before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Most mild COVID-19 patients had upper respiratory
infection syndromes [13] , but they also are strongly infectious, which causes dramatic difficulties
in screening. Consequently, it was not possible to exclude COVID-19 merely based on clinical
symptoms [14]. We found that patients’ average age trended older after the outbreak [15]. A
reasonable explanation for this was that patients with relatively severe diseases had to seek
medical care in hospitals even though they faced a high risk of cross-infection with COVID-19.
Older people generally have a higher risk of severe disease, but this difference did not exist in
critically ill patients, likely because most critical patients were elderly people.
All patients in the FC were regarded as potential sources of infection, thus decreasing the number
of patients who had to be transferred to the ED from the FC was an important strategy. Before the
outbreak, the major work of the FC was identifying influenza, which might take about half an
hour. Once negative results were reported, patients could be transferred to the ED with limited
precautions. Once COVID-19 hit, frequent transfers between the FC and ED might cause crowded
situations in the ED and increase exposure risks. Our data showed a lower transfer rate after the
outbreak, likely due to increasing amounts of medical treatment (as opposed to just testing before
the outbreak) in the FC. To those patients who were finally transferred to the ED within 24 hours,
a longer FC retention time was observed due to the prolonged screening time for COVID-19.
During their time in the FC, patients received treatments aimed at decreasing the number of
patients in the ED. Even though some patients had to seek further medical advice in the ED,
initial treatments given in the FC might also shorten their length of stay in the ED.
Intensive screening played an important role in COVID-19 identification. Before the outbreak,
fever was the only screening indicator. Unfortunately, 11.5% of COVID-19 patients did not
manifest fever, but as many as 82.4% of patients had respiratory symptoms, such as cough,
expectoration and dyspnea[12]. These phenomena impelled us to expand screening criteria. Thus,
all patients meeting one or more of the following conditions had to be screened in the FC: positive
COVID-19 contact exposure, fever or respiratory symptoms. With this new criteria, the number of
FC patients grew dramatically in the 40 days after January 20, 2020.
Multiple testing methods were trialed to decrease false negatives. As COVID-19 has diverse
manifestations, it was unreliable to identify this disease based on only one method. In our
screening process, multiple methods, including blood cell analysis, chest CT[16], SARS-COV-2
nucleic acid[17] and antibody tests[18] were used to screen for this disease. However, each method had
its own false negative phenomena, therefore all patients suspected of any viral infection were
recommended to receive another nucleic acid test once more in 24 hours, which helped guarantee
that patients who didn’t retest again and were transferred to the ED within 24 hours had an
extremely low risk of COVID-19. Additionally, in order to avoid false negative results, patients
with the following conditions were suggested to test for SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid once again

one week later, even though previous RNA tests were negative twice: (1) confirmed COVID-19
contact history; (2) clinical manifestations and lab tests suggesting a viral infection unexplained
by another disease; (3) chest CT strongly indicating a viral pneumonia. With these strict screening
criteria, no COVID-19 cases were diagnosed in ED patients previously seen in the FC.
An effective triage strategy also lowered cross-infection risks. As the number of FC patients grew
rapidly, cross-infection prevention was a central concern. According to their COVID-19 contact
history and clinical severity, patients were allocated to one of three specialized regions of the FC.
First, patients with positive contact histories were suggested to keep a person-to-person distance
of at least two meters before further history details were investigated, and only when all tests were
reported negative could they leave the FC. Second, critical patents identified at the triage counter
were immediately admitted to rescue rooms where experienced physicians would provide further
assessment and initial resuscitation. Thus, before the results of the screening tests came
out,patients were all treated as potentially infected. Once negative results were reported, they
could be transferred to the ED resuscitation rooms; otherwise they would continue being treated
in the FC or transferred to dedicated receiving hospitals for COVID-19. Third, FC patients could
now begin to receive initial treatment(s) as soon as possible without waiting for transfer to the
ED.
This study did show that the seven day mortality rate for critically ill patients was higher after the
outbreak than before, even though there were no significant differences of the initial treatment
time.Although this may be due to the presence of COVID-19 in the patient population after the
outbreak, this may also indicate that the longer length of stay in the FC and resuscitation room in
the ED after the outbreak may themselves be factors leading to poor outcomes.
Since the outbreak, nineteen FC patients have been confirmed to be positive for COVID-19. It
should be noted that all of these positive cases were identified in the FC and received initial
treatment there. More importantly, all patients and medical staff in contact with these patients
were strictly followed-up for 14 days and no cross-infections were found.
This retrospective study showed the effect of the changes enacted in the FC at the time of the
COVID-19 outbreak. The modifications taken in the FC to change the triage, testing, and
treatment pathways had a dramatic effect on the FC,as well as offload ED resources.. Although
further studies are needed to determine the exact effects of the FC, the lack of
cross-contamination events in the ED seem to suggest a possible avenue to EDs around the world
to both safeguard their existing ED patients while appropriately caring for potential COVID-19
patients.

negative twice if they have: (1) confirmed COVID-19 contact history; (2) clinical manifestations and lab

tests implying viral infection which can not be explained by other diseases; (3) chest CT strongly

suggestive of

viral pneumonia.
