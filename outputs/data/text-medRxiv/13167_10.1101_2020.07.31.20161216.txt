ABSTRACT

79

BACKGROUND

80

The top priority for the control of COVID-19 pandemic currently is the development

81

of a vaccine. A phase 2 trial conducted to further evaluate the immunogenicity and

82

safety of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac).

83

METHODS

84

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the

85

optimal dose, immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac. A total of 600 healthy

86

adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial

87

vaccine at a dose of 3 μg/0.5 mL or 6 μg /0.5mL, or placebo on Day 0,14 schedule or

88

Day 0,28 schedule. For safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events

89

were collected after each vaccination within 7 days and 28 days, respectively. Blood

90

samples were taken for antibody assay.

91

RESULTS

92

CoronaVac was well tolerated, and no dose-related safety concerns were observed.

93

Most of the adverse reactions fell in the solicited category and were mild in severity.

94

Pain at injection site was the most frequently reported symptoms. No Grade 3 adverse

95

reaction or vaccine related SAEs were reported. CoronaVac showed good

96

immunogenicity with the lower 3 μg dose eliciting 92.4% seroconversion under Day

97

0,14 schedule and 97.4% under Day 0,28 schedule. 28 days after two-dose

98

vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8 to 65.4 among

99

different dosage and vaccination schedules.

105

BACKGROUND

106

In January 2020, outbreaks of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by

107

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) escalated rapidly,

108

and since then COVID-19 cases have been reported in over 200 countries and

109

territories. The pandemic continues to spread unabated affecting the health and

110

changing the lifestyles of people globally.1 To reduce the disease burden and stop the

111

community-wide transmission of COVID-19 across the globe, specific therapeutic

112

agents or vaccines are urgently needed. Till now, more than 120 vaccine candidates

113

have been reported to be under development and at least 23 have progressed to the

114

clinical evaluation stage.2

115

The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with aluminum hydroxide developed by

116

Sinovac Life Sciences Co., Ltd., also known as CoronaVac, has been shown to be safe

117

and could induce SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rats, and

118

nonhuman primates.3 On the basis of the results obtained from our phase 1 trial, no

119

safety concerns have been identified. Notably, immunization of CoronaVac induced

120

immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in adults. Here, we report the results of the

121

phase 2 trial.

122

METHODS

123

TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT

124

This double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial based on a

125

seamless design was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04352608) and was

126

conducted in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, China. Detailed information about

127

the trial has been provided in our previous phase 1 study. The trial protocol and the

128

informed-consent form were approved by the ethics committee of the Jiangsu

129

Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (JSCDC). This clinical trial was

130

conducted in accordance with the Chinese regulatory requirements and the standards

131

of good clinical practice.

132

Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The

133

main exclusion criteria included high-risk epidemiological history, positive IgG, IgM

134

or nucleic acid test of pharyngeal or anal swab, axillary temperature >37.0, allergy

135

to a vaccine component, and other unsuitable conditions.

136

A total of 600 healthy adults aged 18-59 years were randomly assigned into 3 groups

137

in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine at a dose of 3 μg/0.5 mL

138

or 6 μg /0.5mL, or placebo on a Day 0,14 schedule or a Day 0,28 schedule, according

139

to a random list generated by an independent statistician..

140

VACCINE

141

The vaccine candidate was an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 whole virion vaccine with

142

aluminium hydroxide as adjuvant (CoronaVac) developed by Sinovac Life Sciences

143

Co., Ltd. SARS-CoV-2 virus was propagated in Vero cells and harvested. The

144

harvested virus was inactivated using β-propiolactone and further purified. The bulk

145

vaccine material obtained from this step was then adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide

146

and formulated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sodium chloride as

147

inactivated final product. The dosage of 3 μg/0.5 mL and 6 μg /0.5mL were adopted in

148

this study. Whereas the placebo contained aluminum hydroxide diluents with no

149

antigen. Both were administered intramuscularly on the schedule of Day 0,14 or Day

150

0,28.

151

SAFETY ASSESSMENT

152

For safety evaluation of CoronaVac, the participants who received at least one dose of

153

vaccination was included. All vaccinated subjects were observed for immediate

154

adverse events (AEs) on-site for at least 30 minutes after each administration. Diary

155

cards were issued to the participants to record the solicited AEs (e.g. pain, induration,

156

swelling, redness, rash, pruritus) occurring on day 0~7 and unsolicited AEs (e.g. fever,

157

acute allergic reaction, skin and mucosa abnormality, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting,

158

nausea, muscle pain, headache, cough, fatigue) occurring on day 0~28. Data on

159

serious adverse events (SAEs) were collected throughout the trial. All AEs were

160

assessed for severity, and the relationship to vaccination was decided by investigators

161

before unblinding.

162

IMMUNOGENICITY

163

To assess immune response, blood samples were collected from each participant

164

different time points (0/28/42th day for Day 0,14 schedule, and 0/56th day for Day 0,28

165

schedule). The ability of the antibodies present in the blood sample to bind the

166

receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by enzyme-linked

167

immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A dilution of 1:160 was considered as a positive

168

cutoff value. We also measured neutralizing antibody titer (Nab) using a modified

169

cytopathogenic effect assay. A titer of 1:8 or higher indicated seropositivity.

170

Seroconversion was defined as a change from seronegative (<1:8) to seropositive (≥

171

1:8) or a 4-fold increase from baseline titers if seropositive.

172

The neutralizing antibody assay was performed by Chinese National Institutes for

173

Food and Drug Control, and the ELISA was performed by Sinovac Biotech.

174

NEGATIVE STAIN

175

Virus particles of vaccine used for phase 1 and 2 were diluted to a concentration of

176

0.04 mg/mL, deposited on a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (Electron

177

Microscopy Sciences) and after 1 min, washed twice with buffer (20 mM Tris, 200

178

mM NaCl, pH 8.0), and stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) for 1 min.

179

Then the grid was imaged at room temperature using FEI Tecnai Spirit electron

180

microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV.

181
182

STATISITICAL ANALYSIS

183

Safety evaluation was performed on participants who received at least 1 dose of the

184

vaccine or placebo by comparing the overall incidence rate of solicited and

185

unsolicited AEs among relevant groups. Immunogenicity assessment was performed

186

on the per-protocol set (PPS). The seroconversion rate was defined as a change from

187

seronegative to seropositive or a 4-fold increase from baseline titers if seropositive.

188

The titer distributions were described with reverse cumulative distribution curves and

189

were tested with the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test over the groups.

190

The Pearson Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was adopted for the analysis of

191

binary outcomes. Clopper-Pearson method was used to compute the 95% confidence

192

intervals (CIs) of the binary outcome. ANOVA method was utilized to compare the

193

GMTs among groups. Hypothesis testing was two-sided with an alpha value of 0.05.

194

Analyses were conducted by SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

ADVERSE REACTIONS

213

For subjects in Day 0,14 schedule, the incidence rates of adverse reactions in 6 μg, 3

214

μg

215

corresponding incidence rates were 19.2%, 19.2% and 18.3% in Day 0,28 schedule,

216

respectively. Within each schedule, there was no significant difference in the

217

occurrence of adverse reactions among all vaccine and placebo groups (Fig. 1). Most

218

of the adverse reactions were solicited adverse reactions and mild in severity. After

219

each injection, pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local

220

symptoms, which reported in 61 subjects (20.3%) on Day 0,14 schedule and 31

221

subjects (10.3%) on Day 0, 28 schedule. (Additional detailed results related to adverse

222

reactions are available in Table S1).

223

We did not observe any Grade 3 adverse reaction. Most reported adverse reactions

224

resolved within 72 hours after vaccine administration. During the follow-up period, 3

225

SAEs were reported from 3 subjects and neither was vaccine related.

236

each dosage, there was no significant difference in the seroconversion rates between

237

Day 0,14 and Day 0,28 schedule. For the antibody response against the receptor

238

binding domain, similar results were observed (Table S2). No changes in

239

seropositivity frequencies and GMTs from baseline were found for the placebo group.

240

For subjects on Day 0,14 schedule, the GMT increased to 34.5 (95% CI, 28.5 to 41.8)

241

and 27.6 (95% CI, 22.7 to 33.5) in 6 μg and 3 μg group, respectively, and remained

242

stable after 28 days from the second injection (Fig. 2A). The neutralizing antibody

243

titers for subjects on Day 0, 28 schedule increased significantly 28 days after the

244

second injection, when compared to those of subjects on Day 0,14 schedule within

245

each dosage group. Almost similar trends like those observed for the neutralizing

246

antibody were observed during the evaluation of the IgG antibody level (Fig. 2B). In

247

addition, the neutralizing antibody titers significantly decreased with increasing age

248

(Fig. 2C and 2D); younger subjects tended to have a higher level of neutralizing

249

antibody titers .

DISCUSSION

278

This trial demonstrated that the 2 doses of different dosage of CoronaVac were well

279

tolerated and immunogenic in healthy adults aged 18-59 years. The incidence rates of

280

adverse reactions in the 6 μg and 3 μg group were comparable, indicating that there

281

was no dose-related aggravating concern on safety. Furthermore, no SAEs related to

282

vaccine occurred, and most adverse reactions reported were generally assessed to be

283

mild. The safety profile of CoronaVac is comparable to that observed in our phase 1

284

clinical trial [see the coordinated submission], and to other inactivated vaccine

285

formulations manufactured by Sinovac.4,5 Compared with other COVID-19 vaccine

286

candidates, the incidence rate of fever was relatively low in our clinical trial, which

287

further indicates that CoronaVac was well tolerated.6-10

288

It's worth noting that the immune responses elicited in phase 2 were much better than

289

those recorded in phase 1, with seroconversion rates over 90%. Our preclinical

290

investigations had revealed that cell culture technology closely correlated with viral

291

propagation and affected viral morphology, protein composition and prefusion

292

conformation of spikes.3 In both preclinical study and phase 1 trials, a 50-liter culture

293

of Vero cells grown in the Cell Factory system was used, while an optimized process

294

for growing cells using a highly automated bioreactor, where cell culture parameters

295

like dissolved oxygen, pH, and CO2/O2 gas levels, were controlled precisely, was

296

developed for producing the CoronaVac for phase 2 trial. To deduce the reasons

297

underlying the enhanced protective immune responses observed in phase 2 trial, we

298

examined the molecular differences between the CoronaVac used in phase 1 and 2

299

trials. Protein composition analysis of the purified inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions

300

indicated that the bioreactor-produced CoronaVac possessed higher redundancy of

301

intact spike protein (~180 kDa) when compared to the Cell Factory-yielded

302

CoronaVac (Fig. 3A). Quantitative analysis showed that the intact spike protein

303

accounted for ~7% and ~ 3.7 of total protein mass used in phase 1 and 2 trials,

304

respectively. Electron microscopic examination of the samples further verified that the

305

average number of spikes per virion of the viral sample used in phase 2 trial was

306

almost double to those used in phase 1 trial (Fig. 3B). These observations indicated

307

that CoronaVac used in phase 2 trial contained more bona fide immunogens, which

308

explains its better protective immune responses, highlighting the importance of

309

developing

310

multiple-disciplinary techniques, such as genomics and structural biology to support a

311

new era of precision vaccinology.

312

After two-dose vaccination, immune responses induced by Day 0,28 schedule was

313

above the value of Day 0,14 schedule regardless of the dosage of the vaccine, which

314

was consistent with our anticipation. By using Day 0,14 schedule, antibody response

315

could be induced within a relatively short time period, and this schedule could be

316

introduced to an emergency use and is of vital importance to handle COVID-19

317

pandemic situation. Regarding the Day 0,28 schedule, robust antibody response is

318

generated and longer persistence could be expected, which supports the need for a

319

routine use under the low incidence rate of COVID-19.

320

Nabs play an important role in virus clearance and have been considered as a key

321

immune correlate for protection or treatment against viral diseases. Twenty-eight days

322

after the two-dose vaccination, the Nab levels of individual schedules range from 23.8

323

to 65.4 in phase 2, which was lower than those of convalescent patients tested by the

324

same method in the same laboratory, of which the Nab average level was 163.7.11 We

325

assume the antibody level could provide satisfying protection against COVID-19

326

disease based on three reasons. Firstly, most of the surrogate endpoints based on

327

neutralizing antibodies ranges from 8-24, such as EV71 and Varicella vaccines.12,13

328

Secondly, experience from our preclinical study indicated that the neutralizing

329

antibody titers of 1:24 elicited in macaques models conferred complete protection

330

against SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, several studies revealed that antibody responses

331

generated from natural infection may decreased significantly, such as SARS-Cov-2,

332

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,14-16 however, recrudesce of these patients has been

333

rarely reported, which indicated that the immunological memory might play an

334

important role of prevention of re-infections.

335

Moreover, one prospective goal of our preclinical study and clinical trials was to

336

establish a vaccine-induced surrogate of protection. Compared with vaccine inducing

337

high level antibody, those inducing lower antibody level are more likely to produce

338

evidence on surrogate of protection. Under above assumptions, the dosage of 3 μg

339

with Day 0,14 or Day 0,28 schedule is adopted in our phase 3 trial.

340

When comparing antibody levels between age-groups, it should be noted that the

341

neutralizing antibody titers significantly decreased with increasing age. These results

342

are consistent with epidemiological trends observed in COVID-19 patients; those with

343

moderate or severe symptoms tend to be elderly.17 These results suggest that escalated

344

dosage or extra dose of CoronaVac might be needed in elderly.

345

Several limitations of this trial should be noted. Firstly, we only assessed the humoral

346

immunity in phase 2 trial, and more evaluation focus on response of Th1 and Th2 is

347

ongoing. Secondly, we only reported immune response data on healthy adults, and do

348

not include data on more susceptible populations, such as elderly or with comorbidity;

349

and also the immune persistence is not available yet, which need to be further studied.

350

Thirdly, we didn’t compare the neutralizing antibody titers induced by CoronaVac and

351

convalescent COVID-19 patients in parallel, however, we conducted this detection of

352

convalescent serum specimens with same procedure performed in this phase 2 trial.

353

In conclusion, favorable safety and immunogenicity of CoronaVac was demonstrated

354

on both schedules and both dosages in this phase 2 clinical trial, which support the

355

conduction of phase 3 trial with optimum schedule/dosage per different scenarios.

356

Currently, our first priority is to evaluate the protective efficacy of the 3 μg dosage

357

under Day 0,14 schedule. Moreover, Day 0,28 schedule with 3 μg vaccine will also be

358

adopted in our future phase 3 clinical trials.
