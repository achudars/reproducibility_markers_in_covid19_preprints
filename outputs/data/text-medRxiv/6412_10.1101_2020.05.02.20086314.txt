ABSTRACT
Objectives: To provide the first known comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 outcomes in a
federal penitentiary system. We examined the following COVID-19 outcomes within federal
penitentiaries in Canada and contrasted them with estimates for the overall population in the
penitentiaries’ respective provincial jurisdictions: testing, prevalence, the proportion recovered,
and fatality.
Methods: Data for prisons were obtained from the Correctional Service of Canada and, for the
general population, from the Esri COVID-19 Canadian Outbreak Tracking Hub. Data were
retrieved between March 30 and April 21, 2020, and are accurate to this date. Penitentiary-,
province- and sex-specific frequency statistics for each outcome were calculated.
Results: Data on 50 of 51 penitentiaries (98%) were available. Of these, 72% of penitentiaries
reported fewer tests per 1000 population than the Canadian general population average (16
tests/1000 population), and 24% of penitentiaries reported zero tests. Penitentiaries with high
levels of testing were those that already had elevated COVID-19 prevalence. Five penitentiaries
reported an outbreak (at least one case). Hardest hit penitentiaries were those in Quebec, Ontario,
and British Columbia, with some prisons reporting COVID-19 prevalence of 30% to 40%. Of
these, two were women’s prisons. Female prisoners were over-represented among cases (31% of
cases overall, despite representing 5% of the total prison population).
Conclusion: Increased sentinel or universal testing may be appropriate given the confined nature
of prison populations. This, along with rigorous infection prevention control practices and the
potential release of prisoners, will be needed to curb current outbreaks and those likely to come.

GRAPHICAL SUMMARY

•

Between 20% and 57% fewer tests per 1000 population have been conducted in federal
prisons in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Alberta than in the general
population of those provinces.

•

Though Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are
reporting lower counts of COVID-19 cases, these are also the regions reporting the
lowest levels of testing.

•

Case incidence has been highest in federal prisons in Quebec, Ontario, and British
Columbia, where a total of five prisons are experiencing outbreaks (1 or more cases).
These regions are those reporting the highest levels of testing – higher than the testing
levels in the general population.

1. BACKGROUND

49
50

As we are (re)learning from the evidence of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities,

51

housing large groups of individuals in confined, institutionalized environments is a recipe for

52

large-scale, human-to-human transmission of infectious disease. Prisons have similar dynamics

53

of confinement, of residents who are dependent on the institutions’ conditions and policies for

54

basic living and hygiene and, of clinical susceptibility due to underlying health conditions [1-3].

55

Epidemiologic findings from past outbreaks of respiratory diseases such as influenza,

56

adenoviruses, and tuberculosis in high-income countries highlight the higher likelihood of

57

infection transmission and disease incidence within prisons compared to the general population.

58

[1-3]. Early reports suggest that several penitentiaries in the United States are experiencing

59

COVID-19 outbreaks [4], though, as far as we know, no comprehensive analysis of theses

60

penitentiaries has yet been conducted, and very little is known about COVID-19 in prison

61

contexts in other high-income countries. In this study, we use Canadian data to provide the first

62

known examination of COVID-19 statistics for a federal penitentiary system. In doing so, we

63

also bring front-and-center a major health equity issue, because Indigenous and racialized

64

communities are over-represented within the Canadian prison system [5].

65
66

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are specific factors that place prisoner

67

populations at particularly high risk of COVID-19 infection, and of a higher risk for severe

68

(compared to mild) COVID-19 outcomes. These include housing multiple prisoners to one cell

69

(“double-bunking”)[6], the ageing population within prisons—particularly in federal prisons[7],

70

a high prevalence of chronic disease comorbidities and immuno-compromised health status

71

associated with substance use and blood-borne infections[8], and the regular entrance of

72

custodial and health care staff from communities with likely community-based transmission.

73
74

At the time of writing (late April 2020), Canada has been documenting the COVID-19 pandemic

75

on its soil for almost two months. In late March 2020, the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC),

76

Canada’s federal body responsible for incarcerated individuals serving sentences of at least two

77

years, had indicated that they had taken steps to prevent and were prepared to respond to

78

COVID-19 outbreaks inside its federal penitentiaries [9]. With this study, we aim to offer a

79

baseline situational assessment of COVID-19 testing and burden in Canadian federal

80

penitentiaries, from which future analyses can be based. This study aims to summarize and

81

compare the prevalence of testing, test positivity, COVID-19 prevalence, case fatality, and the

82

proportion of cases recovered within federal penitentiaries in Canada, by province and for

83

Canada overall, and to contrast these with rates in penitentiaries’ respective provincial

84

jurisdictions.

2. METHOD

87
88

Data and study population

89
90

In an unprecedented act of transparency, CSC made COVID-19 testing and case numbers

91

publicly available for each federal penitentiary on their website. Data up until April 21, 2020,

92

were used [10]. Equivalent values for the Canadian population were extracted from the COVID-

93

19 Canada Outbreak Tracker Resource Hub [11]. For each indicator, described below, we

94

calculated prison-, sex-, and province-specific estimates. Prison population denominators were

95

approximated by the maximum prison capacity for each penitentiary [12]. For the general

96

population, denominators (i.e., total general population) were obtained from Statistics Canada

97

population estimates for the first quarter of 2020 [13].

98
99

Additionally, to provide a timeline for the number of tests and cases in prisons with possible

100

outbreaks (5 or more cases at the time of analysis), we used the Wayback Machine (archive.org)

101

to obtain all previous copies of CSC’s COVID-19 reporting webpage [10]. The earliest version

102

of the CSC webpage was created on April 1, 2020, which provided cumulative data up until

103

March 30, 2020. There were eight additional updates, which reported on data from April 7, 8,10,

104

12, 13, 15, 17, and 18, 2020. Cumulative data at each of these dates were merged with the data

105

from April 21, 2020, to create a time-series ranging from March 30 to April 21, 2020. For

106

calendar dates at which no CSC updates were made available, we filled in the information with

107

the data from the previous observation.

109

Given that several federal penitentiaries are in fact multiplex sites—either with distinct buildings

110

or units operating under different security levels (e.g. minimum, medium or maximum) or

111

offering distinct services (e.g. treatment facilities)—and that sub-population capacities were not

112

always available for each separate unit, we chose to group several multi-complex facilities in our

113

analyses. This was the case of Quebec’s Federal Training Center Multi-Level Unit and Minimum

114

security facility; British Columbia’s Pacific Institution, Pacific Institution Regional Treatment

115

Center and Pacific Institution Reception Center; Ontario’s Millhaven Institution, Millhaven

116

Regional Hospital and Millhaven Regional Treatment Center, as well as Collins Bay Minimum

117

Institution and Collins Bay Regional Treatment Center, and Joyceville Institution and Joyceville

118

Minimum Institution. With these groupings, we recorded 51 facilities. We were able to analyze

119

data from 50 of these facilities (98%) (all data in Supplementary File 1).

120
121

Measures

122
123

Total tests and cases

124

The total number of tests performed was obtained directly from the CSC and the Canada

125

Outbreak Tracker Resource Hub websites. CSC reports on the number of “positive tests”. We

126

considered all “positive tests” as confirmed cases.

127
128

Tests per 1000 population

129

Tests per 1000 population were estimated by dividing the total number of tests performed by the

130

total population in each facility, in the prisoner population of each province, and the general

131

population of each province, respectively, and multiplying the fraction by 1000.

132
133

Test-positive rate

134

We estimated the proportion of tests that were positive by dividing the total number of positive

135

tests (confirmed cases) by the total number of tests, in each prison, provincial prison population,

136

and the provincial general population.

139

We estimated the prevalence of COVID-19 as identified through tests in the penitentiary and

140

provincial populations by dividing the total number of positive tests (confirmed cases) by the

141

population of each facility, the total prison population by province, and the total provincial

142

population, respectively. This indicator can also be considered the cumulative incidence

143

proportion.

144
145

Proportion recovered

146

To offer a crude estimate of the evolution of the epidemics inside and outside of prisons, we

147

estimated the proportion of cases that had recovered. This was done by dividing the number of

148

cases who had recovered by the total number of positive tests (total confirmed cases).

149

Operational definitions of recovered cases vary across jurisdictions in Canada, and CSC does not

150

define their measure in their reporting. Recovered cases are those who either received

151

confirmatory negative test results or for whom 10 to 14 days have elapsed since the start of their

152

symptoms and they are symptom-free for at least 2 to 3 days [14, 15]. Therefore, we interpret

153

recovered case numbers with caution.

154
155

Population categories in prisons with outbreaks: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered and Died

156

An outbreak of COVID-19 within confined populations, such as long-term care homes, can be

157

declared after a single resident or staff member is confirmed positive [16]. Thus, we consider

158

prisons with one or more reported cases of COVID-19 among its prisoner population as those

159

experiencing outbreaks. To describe the evolution of testing and incidence in prisons with

160

outbreaks across our study period, we classified each prison’s population into four categories, for

161

each calendar day of the study period. We estimated the number of prisoners who were

162

“susceptible” to infection by subtracting the total number of confirmed active, recovered, and

163

deceased cases from the maximum population capacity of each prison. Prisoners considered

164

“infected” were those with positive tests who had yet to recover or die. Prisoners declared to be

165

“recovered” were assumed to no longer present active infections or be susceptible to infection.

166

Lastly, the total number of prisoners who had “died” were those whose death was declared to

167

result from COVID-19 complications.

171

3.1 Testing inside versus outside federal prisons

172
173

An analysis of testing within all federal penitentiaries illustrates both the heterogeneity of

174

COVID-19 testing within prisons in Canada and a low if not a complete absence of testing in

175

many facilities (Figure 1). Twelve of the 50 facilities studied—nearly one in five (24%)—had

176

recorded a complete absence of testing (indicated by hollow bars in Figure 1). Approximately

177

72% of all facilities (36/50) recorded fewer tests than the Canadian general population average of

178

16 tests per 1000 population. Facilities with higher levels of testing per 1000 population, tended

179

to be those that had already reported a higher COVID-19 prevalence (Figure 1).

180
181

On average across provinces, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan have

182

been testing less inside prisons than in the general population (Figure 2). The opposite is true for

183

Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia, which were likely responsible for driving the average of

184

34 tests per 1000 population observed for the prison population, overall.

185
186

3.2 Prevalence of COVID-19 inside versus outside federal prisons

187
188

The high positive test rates and estimated prevalence of COVID-19 in prisons in Quebec and

189

British Columbia point to emerging outbreaks in these provinces (Figure 2). Prevalence was 10

190

times higher in Quebec, 6 times higher in British Columbia, and 2 times higher in Ontario within

191

federal prisons compared to the general population of each province (Figure 2).

192
193

Many of the hardest-hit penitentiaries are near major city centers. In Quebec, this was the

194

Federal Training Center complex in Laval, just north of Montreal (51 cases, 7% COVID-19

195

prevalence) and, Joliette Institution for Women in Joliette, a 1-hour drive away from Montreal

196

(51 cases, 39% prevalence). However, Port Cartier Institution in Côte Nord (a relatively remote

197

region of the province) also reported 15 cases (Figure 1). In British Columbia, most affected was

198

the Mission Medium Security Institution, a 1-hour drive away from Vancouver (64 cases, 30%

199

prevalence) (Figure 1). Ontario’s Grand Valley Institution for Women, located in Kitchener (1-

200

hour drive away from Toronto) also experienced a smaller outbreak of 8 cases (6% prevalence).

207

In the five institutions with one or more cases, we found that testing was largely reactive, with

208

the onset of concentrated testing efforts occurring after COVID-19 outbreaks had already

209

established. An exception to this observation was Quebec’s Federal Training Center, which was

210

the only facility recording negative tests before the observations of positive tests (Figure 3).

211

Further, though institutions all recorded a gradual increase in the number of tests performed over

212

time, the high proportion of positive tests throughout the study period suggests that these prisons

213

likely did not implement more intensive, wide-spread testing throughout the prison populations

214

once a case was observed. An exception to this, however, was Ontario’s Grand Valley Women’s

215

Institution, which recorded a significant jump in testing once the first cases were confirmed, with

216

a majority of tests returning negative since April 7, 2020.

217
218

3.3 Proportion of cases recovered and fatality inside versus outside prisons

219
220

The proportion of cases that had recovered inside federal penitentiaries ranged from 0% to 33%

221

(Figure 1). The Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered plots (Figure 4) illustrate what proportion

222

of prisoners each prison with one or more cases have become infected and have recovered or

223

died throughout the study period. Of the five prisons with outbreaks, Quebec’s Joliette Women’s

224

Institution and British Columbia’s Mission Medium Institution have the seen largest proportion

225

of their population become infected and subsequently recover. Smaller proportions of cases have

226

recovered in Quebec’s Federal Training Centre and Port-Cartier and Ontario’s Grand Valley

227

Women’s Institution, and plot results suggest that a large proportion of prisoners remain

228

susceptible in these institutions (Figure 4).

236

In contrast to cases in the general population, a smaller proportion of cases in federal

237

penitentiaries in Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia had recovered (Figure 2). In both

238

Ontario and British Columbia, the proportion of individuals who had recovered within prisons

239

was half that of the proportion of cases recovered in the community. With the available evidence,

240

it is difficult to know precisely what may be driving these differences in percent recovered inside

241

versus outside of prisons. One explanation is that outbreaks inside prisons may have started more

242

recently than those within the general public. Another possibility is that health and sanitary

243

conditions within prisons may lead to lags in recovery. Further, this cross-sectional summary of

244

differences must be interpreted with caution, since the proportion of cases that are recovered will

245

vary according to the number of new incident cases observed in both settings.

246
247

At the time of data collection, one of the 189 laboratory-confirmed cases across all federal

248

penitentiaries had died (0.5%), a 67% higher proportion than that observed in the general

249

population, (0.3%, 1,966 of 614,340 cases). Case fatality estimates should be interpreted with

250

caution, however, given the likely underestimation of the true number of cases (denominator

251

value) in both settings.

259
260

785 women (5% of the total capacity of 16,401 federal prisoners in Canada).

261
262

Among the 50 facilities included in these analyses, six are penitentiaries for women (Nova

Figure 5: Distribution of women among federal prisons and prison COVID-19 cases (Canada, April 21, 2020).

263

At the time of data collection, there were 59 cases of COVID-19 in women’s penitentiaries.

264

These represented 31% of all cases in federal penitentiaries (N=189) (Figure 5), suggesting that

265

women, and women’s penitentiaries, are over-represented among COVID-19 cases inside federal

266

prisons. COVID-19 prevalence was 8 times higher among women’s prisons (8% prevalence)

267

than prisons for men (1% prevalence) and 80 times higher than in the general Canadian

268

population (0.1%).

269
270

4. DISCUSSION

271
272

Key findings

273
274

The data suggest that at least five federal penitentiaries, one in British Columbia, three in Quebec

275

and one in Ontario, are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks. Each of these penitentiaries is

276

reporting high levels of testing, compared to provincial and national rates, and this testing

277

appears to be a reaction to the emergence of outbreaks that have already begun, rather than a

278

proactive prevention effort. Though at least thirteen (26%) of facilities appear to be experiencing

279

very low if any COVID-19 cases, these are also facilities that have reported low levels of testing

280

per 1000 population, so it is unclear whether the low case counts reflect true case prevalence. We

281

observed lower levels of testing than the Canadian general population average in 26

282

penitentiaries (72%) and a total absence of testing in 12 penitentiaries (24%). Our study also

283

suggests a smaller proportion of cases inside prisons have recovered compared to cases in the

284

general population. This may indicate that the spread of COVID-19 is lagging in penitentiaries,

285

and the worst is yet to come. It may also indicate that prisoners face suboptimal conditions for

286

recovery. We also found that at least three of the current penitentiary outbreaks are in proximity

287

to city centers (e.g. Montreal and Vancouver), and higher COVID-19 prevalence has been

288

observed in women’s (8% prevalence) compared to men’s prisons (1% prevalence), overall.

289
290

Strengths and limitations

291
292

The primary strength of this study is its use of the best available data on COVID-19 testing and

293

case incidence in Canadian Federal penitentiaries and the general Canadian population to give an

294

early situational report on testing and infection-related outcomes within these facilities. This

295

study is a baseline assessment from which future analyses using updated data can be based. A

296

limitation of this study is our use of the maximum potential capacity of each penitentiary as the

297

population denominator for rate calculations, rather than the ‘true’ population at the time of data

298

collection. We expect that these denominators are likely too large, given that prisons may not be

299

at their full capacity and pressures to release non-violent offenders to reduce the number of

300

susceptible individuals within prisons [17]. This may have led to the under-estimation of testing

301

and infection prevalence estimates. Further, this study was not able to also count the number of

302

tests and cases identified within custodial and health staff within these same penitentiaries, which

303

is an important contributing factor to disease transmission. While other deaths in federal

304

penitentiaries were recorded by CSC during the study period (e.g. [18]), only one case was

305

reported as COVID-19 related. It is unclear whether other deaths occurring within CSC facilities

306

have or will be tested for COVID-19 post-mortem. Lastly, these findings may not be

307

generalizable to provincial, remand, or immigration detention facilities, which may see far more

308

movement in and out given the shorter duration of sentences.

309
310

Implications

311
312

These early findings have several implications for public health and emergency outbreak

313

response inside federal penitentiaries. The observation that at least five Canadian penitentiaries

314

are experiencing outbreaks highlights the importance that all penitentiary populations and

315

custodial and health care staff uphold rigorous prevention control practices (and be given the

316

resources to do so), including regular hand hygiene and cleaning practices, the use of personal

317

protection equipment, and physical distancing measures [19]. Scholars and legal experts have

318

also emphasized the need to consider the release of prisoners to reduce the proportion of

319

susceptible individuals within prisons [20].

320
321

Our findings of sparse testing across several penitentiaries in Canada suggests that a more

322

proactive testing approach may be needed to help curb potential future outbreaks. This is

323

especially the case given studies suggesting that up to 60% of COVID-19 cases may be

324

asymptomatic [21-23]. Testing based on symptom-presence alone may thus need to be

325

reconsidered within the confined spaces of prisons, as many cases may go undetected as long as

326

testing is not expanded.

327
328

Relevant testing strategies could include universal testing or, active, sentinel-based testing.

329

While universal testing [19] [24] is time and resource-intensive but is much more feasible within

330

small confined populations than in the general public. In the context of COVID-19, this strategy

331

has been used navy ships [21] and homeless shelters [25, 26] to identify all cases and adapt

332

outbreak control interventions accordingly. In Canadian penitentiaries, universal testing may be

333

most pertinent in prisons that have already reported confirmed cases. At the time of writing,

334

British Columbia’s Mission Institution penitentiary — where one of the five outbreaks is

335

unfolding — had reported planning universal testing of all inmates and staff [27]. However, none

336

of the other institutions had indicated plans to use such an approach.

337
338

As an alternative to universal testing, active sentinel surveillance involves identifying a subset of

339

prisons in which regular testing for COVID-19 among prisoners and staff, regardless of symptom

340

presence, could be conducted. Test results would be used for monitoring in the months to come

341

until a vaccine or effective treatment is identified. This approach may be most relevant in

342

provinces with low numbers of new daily COVID-19 cases (e.g. currently New Brunswick, Nova

343

Scotia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba currently) or in later in the pandemic, when community

344

transmission subsides and testing all prisoners may be too costly and inefficient.

345
346

These types of proactive surveillance activities may be particularly important in the context of

347

alternative options to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as long-term cell-based confinement

348

for the entire prison population. Confinement has been associated with severe mental health risk

349

[28]—particularly for Indigenous and racialized populations [6]—and has come under

350

considerable scrutiny in Canada in recent years [29].

351
352

Lastly, studies on the effectiveness of universal and sentinel-based testing strategies are

353

warranted, as are mathematical models that explore the epidemiologic consequence of

354

interventions (or lack thereof) within federal prisons on COVID-19 transmission, morbidity and

355

death, as has been done in other country settings [30].

5. CONCLUSION

358
359

Gaps in COVID-19 testing in several jurisdictions and recorded outbreaks in several

360

penitentiaries in Canada suggest that federal prisons represent an emerging battleground against

361

the COVID-19 pandemic. With an ageing population that is particularly at high risk due to the

362

prevalence of underlying chronic and infectious health conditions, prisoners represent a

363

potentially neglected segment of society that is at high risk of bearing a high burden of COVID-

364

19 related morbidity and mortality. As indigenous and racialized communities are over-

365

represented within the Canadian prison system, COVID-19 prevention inside penitentiaries

366

represents a pressing public health and health equity issue.
