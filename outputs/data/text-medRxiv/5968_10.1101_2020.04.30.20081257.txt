Abstract

34

Background: COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as hypertension or heart failure (HF) are

35

associated with poor clinical outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the critical enzyme

36

for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is broadly expressed in many organs including heart. However, the cellular

37

distribution of ACE2 in the human heart, particularly the failing heart is unknown.

38

Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in both normal and failing hearts,

39

and characterized the ACE2 gene expression profile in various cell subsets, especially in cardiomyocyte

2

40

subsets, as well as its interaction with gene networks relating to various defense and immune responses

41

at the single cell level.

42

Results: The results demonstrated that ACE2 is present in cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial cells,

43

fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the heart, while the number of ACE2-postive (ACE2+) CMs and

44

ACE2 gene expression in these CMs are significantly increased in the failing hearts. Interestingly, both

45

brain natriuretic peptides (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) are significantly up-regulated in

46

the ACE2+ CMs. Further analysis shows that ANP, BNP and ACE2 may form a negative feedback loop

47

with a group of genes associated with the development of heart failure. To our surprise, we found that

48

genes related to virus entry, virus replication and suppression of interferon-gamma（IFN-γ）signaling

49

are all up-regulated in CMs in failing hearts, and the increases were significantly higher in ACE2+ CMs

50

as compared with ACE2 negative (ACE2-) CMs, suggesting that these ACE2+ CMs may be more

51

vulnerable to virus infection. Since ACE2 expression is correlated with BNP expression, we further

52

performed retrospective analysis of the plasma BNP levels and clinic outcome of 91 COVID-19 patients

53

from a single-center. Patients with higher plasma BNP were associated with significantly higher

54

mortality rate and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers such as procalcitonin and

55

C-reactive protein.

56

Conclusion: In the failing heart, the upregulation of ACE2 and virus infection associated genes, as well

57

as the increased expression of ANP and BNP could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and replication

58

in these vulnerable cardiomyocyte subsets. These findings may advance our understanding of the

59

underlying molecular mechanisms of myocarditis associated with COVID-19.

Introduction

110

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory

111

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells via binding its surface

112

"spike" to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1. SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide and

113

was classified as a pandemic in 2020. As of May 2020, more than four million cases of COVID-19 and

114

more than 276,000 deaths have been reported worldwide2. In addition to the severe lung infection, the

115

SARS-CoV-2 also causes myocarditis, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure (HF)

116

other hand, COVID-19 patients with any pre-existing conditions, such as hypertension, coronary heart

117

disease, and cardiac injury, have worse clinical outcomes than those without these comorbidity 5, 6. Thus,

118

statistical results indicate a vicious cycle between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac dysfunction or

119

HF 5.

120

ACE2 is the critical enzyme degrading the pro-inflammatory angiotensin-II to the anti-inflammatory

121

Ang 1-7 7,8. Unfortunately, ACE2 also facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection in host cells. ACE2 is highly

122

expressed in the nose, kidney, intestine, colon, brain, endothelium, testis, and heart9-14. A recent study

123

from Zou et al. reported that ~7% cardiomyocytes (CMs) express ACE2 in normal human cardiac

124

tissues11, suggesting that some CMs can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, ACE2 gene

125

expression in different cardiomyocyte subsets, as well as its dynamic changes in failing human hearts

126

at the single cell level, are totally unknown.

127

Since ACE2 plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiac function, it is critically

128

important to understand its distribution and the biological changes associated with alterations in its

129

expression in normal and failing hearts. Therefore, we investigated the ACE2 gene expression profiles

130

by analyzing the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset derived from both normal and failing

131

human hearts15. Interestingly, we found that ACE2 was selectively expressed in some of ventricular and

132

atrial CMs, vascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and immune cells in both normal

133

and failing hearts, and its expression was further increased in several cell subsets in the failing hearts.

134

Importantly, we found that brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)

135

transcripts are co-upregulated in ACE2-postive (ACE2+) CMs. BNP, ANP, and ACE2 may form a

136

feedback loop associated with the RAAS (rein-angiotensin-aldosterone-system)/Ang II signaling

137

pathway. Furthermore, ACE2 expression was also associated with the dynamic changes of a group of

138

genes related to viral infection and acquired immunity. Since there is a positive correlation between the

139

expressions of BNP and ACE2, we further analyzed the clinic outcome, inflammation markers, and

140

blood BNP levels in COVID-19 patients retrospectively. Together, these findings provide important

141

insights to advance our understanding of the interplays between ACE2, viral infection and inflammation,

142

as well as cardiac injury and failure.

Study design and Participants

146

This retrospective, single-center study included 91 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

147

admitted to Ezhou Central Hospital, Ezhou, China from January 25, 2020 and March 30, 2020. PCR-

148

Fluorescence probing based kit (Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Kit,

149

Sansure Biotech, China) was used to extract nucleic acids from clinical samples and to detect

150

the ORF1ab gene (nCovORF1ab) and the N gene (nCoV-NP) according to the manufacturer’s

151

instructions. SARS-CoV-2 infection was laboratory-confirmed if the nCovORF1ab and nCoV-

152

NP tests were both positive results. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of

153

Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine (Shanghai, China). Patient

154

informed consent was waived by each ethics committee due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 was diagnosed by meeting at least one of these two criteria: (i) chest computerized

157

tomography (CT) manifestations of viral pneumonia; and/or (ii) reverse transcription-polymerase chain

158

reaction (RT-PCR) according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th

159

edition) published by the National Health Commission of China (New Coronavirus Pneumonia

160

Prevention and Control Program. 2020) and WHO interim guidance16. We used the following inclusion

161

and exclusion criteria to determine the study cohort. The inclusion criteria were confirmed COVID19,

162

valid BNP level and aged above 18 years. The exclusion criteria were incomplete medical records,

163

pregnancy, acute myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary embolism, acute stroke, HIV infection, and

164

preexisting organ failure (chronic cirrhosis, chronic renal failure, or severe congestive heart failure and

165

end-stage cancer).

167

Data Collection

168

The demographic characteristics and clinical data (comorbidities, laboratory findings, and outcomes)

169

for participants during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Cardiac

170

biomarkers measured on admission were collected, including Troponin I (TNI), creatine kinase-MB

171

(CK-MB), and BNP. All data were independently reviewed and entered into the computer database by

172

three analysts. Since the echocardiography data were unavailable for most patients, patients were

173

categorized according to the BNP level. Acute HF was defined as a blood BNP level ≥100 pg/ml. The

174

clinical outcomes (i.e., discharges and mortality) were monitored up to 30 days.

177

Descriptive statistics were obtained for all study variables. Continuous data were expressed as mean

178

(standard deviation (SD)) or median (interquartile [IQR]) values. Categorical data were expressed as

179

proportions. All continuous variables were compared using the t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test if

180

appropriate. In contrast, categorical variables were analyzed for the study outcome by Fisher exact test

181

or χ2 test. The Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used for

182

linear correlation analysis. Survival analysis between patients with BNP<100 pg/mL and ≥100 pg/mL

183

was conducted by the Kaplan-Meier estimate with p-value generated by the log-rank test. Data were

184

analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp) or Graphpad Prism 8.0.1 (GraphPad Software, San

185

accession codes GSE109816 and GSE121893. Briefly, samples from twelve healthy donors and

191

samples from six patients with HF were collected at the time of heart transplantation. The range of

Single-cell clustering and identified cell types

200

The processed read count matrix was imported into R (Version 3.6.2) and converted to a Seurat object

201

using the Seurat R package (Version 3.1.2). Cells that had over 75% UMIs derived from the

202

mitochondrial genome were discarded. For the remaining cells, gene expression matrices were

203

normalized to total cellular read count using the negative binomial regression method implemented in

204

Seurat SCTransform function. Cell-cycle scores were calculated using Seurat CellCycleScoring

205

function. The Seurat RunPCA functions were performed to calculate principal components (PCs). We

206

further corrected the batch effect using Harmony because batch effects among the human heart samples

207

were observed. The RunUMAP function with default setting was applied to visualize the first 35

208

Harmony aligned coordinates. The FindClusters function with resolution=0.2 parameter was carried

Results

222

Integrated analysis of normal and HF conditions at single-cell resolution

223

To detect the discrepancy between normal and HF patients, we utilized the scRNA-seq data by Wang

224

et al15 . Briefly, twelve control samples were collected from healthy donor hearts (hereinafter called

225

normals). Samples from six HF patients were collected at the time of heart transplantation. 9767 out of

226

9994 cells from normals and 4219 out of 4221 cells from patients passed standard quality control and

227

were retained for subsequent analyses. On average, 1649 and 1904 genes were detected in individual

228

cells from normals and patients, respectively. We performed uniform manifold approximation and

229

projection (UMAP) and clustering analysis and grouped the entire population into nine subsets (Fig.

230

1A). Dot plot showed the expression of known markers for nine clusters, which included: 1) endothelial

231

cells (Cluster 1, PECAM1 and VWF); 2) fibroblasts (Cluster 5, LUM and DCN); 3) smooth muscle

232

cells (Cluster 3, MYH11); 4) NK-T/ monocytes (Cluster 6, CD3G and CD163); 5) granulocytes (Cluster

233

9, HP, ITLN1); 6) CM2 and 3 subsets (Clusters 2/4/8, MYH6 and NPPA); 7) CM1 and 4 subsets

234

(Clusters 0 and 7, MYH7 and MYL2) (Fig. 1B). Then, UMAP for individual sample was separately

235

plotted side by side and exhibited the differential distribution of subsets between normal and HF patients.

236

As shown in Fig. 1C, all nine subsets were detected in both normal and patient groups. However, the

237

percentage of CM1 was dramatically decreased (39.65% in normals versus 6.71% in HF, p<0.0001),

238

while the percentage of CM4 was significantly increased (0.03% in normals versus 8.70% in HF,

239

p<0.0001) in HF samples. In addition, the percentages of CM2 (17.70% in normals versus 18.68% in

240

HF, p>0.05) and CM3 (8.27% in normals versus 8.53% in HF, p>0.05）were significantly decreased

241

in HF samples. The percentages of vascular endothelial cells (16.79% in normal versus 28.13% in HF,

242

p<0.0001) and fibroblasts (4.53% in normal versus 8.41% in HF, p<0.0001) were also significantly

243

increased in the failing hearts (Fig. 1D).

244

For each cluster, we calculated the cluster-specific genes (marker genes). Left ventricle (LV) marker

245

genes MYL2 and MYL3 were highly expressed in CM1 and CM4; these subsets were thus termed

246

ventricular cardiomyocytes. Since the left atrial (LA) marker genes MYH6 and MYH7 were highly

247

expressed in CM2 and CM3 subsets, they were termed atrial CMs18.

248

249

Both CMs and Non-CMs (NCMs) show different characteristics between normal and HF patients

250

We compared gene expression of atrial cardiomyocytes (CM2&3) and NCMs between normal and

251

patients. We observed that GO term viral gene expression was up-regulated in all atrial CMs and NCMs

252

in HF (Online Fig. IA-F). These findings suggested that some CMs and NCMs in the heart may be liable

253

to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, GO results showed that genes related to the mitochondrial

254

respiratory complexes and ATP synthesis were up-regulated, while genes related to the inflammatory

255

response, leukocyte migration, response to interferon-gamma and defense against pathogens were

256

downregulated in atrial cardiomyocytes in HF patients. The reduced inflammatory response may result

257

in an increased sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in these atrial CMs (Online Fig. IA).

258

To further characterize this unusual CM4 subset observed in failing hearts, we performed trajectories

259

analysis of the integrated clusters to show the pseudotime of CMs and NCMs. Trajectory and

260

pseudotime results indicated that CM4 originated from CM1 (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with our

13

261

speculation that CM4 may be a distinct type CM after HF. We then conducted GSEA analysis (GO and

262

Pathway) on DEG between CM4 and CM1. Viral gene expression, as well as pathways related to

263

influenza infection, infectious diseases, and HIV infection were upregulated in CM4 (Fig. 2B and 2C);

264

while response to virus, defense response to virus, response to interferon gamma and innate immune

265

response, pathway of the adaptive immune response, interferon signaling and interferon-alpha-beta-

266

gamma signaling were significantly down-regulated in CM4 (Fig. 2D and 2E). Together, these results

267

suggest that the CM4 subset predominantly observed in HF tissues would be more vulnerable to virus

268

infection than the CM1 subset.

269

270

Both CMs and NCMs have different ACE2 expression pattern after HF

271

We further investigated the frequency of ACE2+ cells frequency in CMs and NCMs in normal and

failing hearts. Fig. 3A showed the overall distribution of ACE2+ cells in different subsets of normal

273

and HF samples. The frequency of ACE2+ cells increased significantly in three of four CMs in HF

274

patients, especially in CM1 and CM4. The percentages of ACE2+ cells increased from 5.55% to 34.98%

275

in CM1 subset (p<0.0001), and increased from 0% to 7.01% (p<0.0001) in CM4 subset. The percentage

276

of ACE2+ cells in CM3 subset significantly increased from 6.19% to 13.16% (p<0.0001), while its

277

frequency in CM2 subset did not change significantly (5.55% in normal versus 5.71% in HF, p>0.05)

278

(Fig. 3B). Moreover, the percentages of ACE2+ cells in fibroblasts（p<0.0001）and smooth muscle

279

cells (p=0.0104) were both significantly decreased. The frequency of ACE2+ cells in NK-T

280

Cell/Monocytes increased from 3.77% to 5.42%（p>0.05）, while its percentage in granulocytes was

281

not significantly changed (2.04% in normal versus 5.83% in HF patients, p> 0.05).

282

Taken together, scRNA-seq results demonstrated that the ACE2+ CMs dramatically increased during

283

HF, suggesting that CMs in HF patients may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection than

284

the normal subjects. In addition, ventricular myocytes had a higher percentage of ACE2+ cells than that

285

of atrial myocytes, indicating that these cardiomyocyte subsets may have different responses to SARS-

286

CoV-2 infection.

287

288

Virus infection-related genes are upregulated in CMs in HF patients

289

We then focused on gene expression dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. To further

290

examine the potential role of ACE2+ cells in the myocardium infected by SARS-CoV-2, we separated

291

each cardiomyocyte subset into two sub-groups according to the expression of ACE2 (ACE2+ and

292

ACE2-) and called DEGs between these two groups.

293

One of the most interesting findings was that NPPB (the gene coding BNP) and NPPA (the gene coding

294

ANP) were the top two upregulated genes in ACE2+ cells as compared to ACE2- cells, and the increases

295

were over 1.8 fold for both genes. Previous studies reported that ACE2, ANP, BNP, TnT and TnI could

296

make a feedback loop to preserve ejection fraction in HF patients19-22 . Interestingly, most of the ejection

297

fraction preservation genes were significantly upregulated during HF, especially in ACE2+ CMs cells

298

(Fig. 3C). We used the top 100 DEGs of ACE2+ and ACE2- in CM1,4 to build a gene regulatory

299

network (GRN) using IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, QIAGEN, CA, USA). GRN showed that ACE2,

300

NPPA, NPPB, AGT, TNNT1, TNNT2 and TNNT3 were well connected and shared the same upstream

301

binding transcription factors HAND2, MYOCD, MEF2C, TBX5 which are the well-known

23, 24

302

transcription factors that can control the reprogramming of fibroblasts into CMs(Fig. 3D)

303

above findings further suggest that these cardiac ejection fraction preservation genes may affect SARS-

304

CoV-2-induced cardiomyocyte infection and injury of cardiac myocytes, as their expression is

305

correlated with that of ACE2.

306

We further studied the expression dynamics of ACE2, NPPA and NPPB in CMs and NCMs in normal

307

and HF patients. Both NPPB and NPPA were co-expressed with ACE2 and significantly up-regulated

308

in CMs in HF samples (Fig. 4A, 4B), but NPPB and NPPA showed different expression patterns.

309

Specifically, NPPA was expressed only in CM2, 3 and NCMs, but it was not expressed in CM1 and

310

CM4 subsets in normal heart. NPPA was expressed in all CMs and NCMs, and its expression was

311

significantly upregulated in all cardiomyocyte subsets after HF (Fig. 4B). NPPB was only expressed in

312

CM2 and CM3 subsets in normal heart, and its expression was significantly upregulated in CM2, CM3,

313

and CM1 subsets after HF (Fig. 4A). Pro-ANP and pro-BNP can be processed by corin and intracellular

314

endoprotease furin in in vitro experiments to form active ANP and BNP, respectively25, 26. We found

315

that in HF patients, corin expression increased significantly in CMs while the change in furin was

316

insignificant (Online Fig. IIA), which is consistent with the observation that furin activity, but not its

317

concentration, increased 27. Importantly, at the S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2, a furin cleavage site

318

has been identified, which can enhance the binding of spike protein and host cells28. It was reported that

319

Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, such as B3GALNT1, GALNT1 can mediate the

320

glycosylation of proBNP and increase proBNP secretion in human cardiac during HF29. Both

321

B3GALNT1 and GALNT1 transcription increased in HF patients (Online Fig. IIB). We then assessed

322

other virus infection-related genes, which are involved in virus entry (BSG, CAV2, CHMP3, CHMP5,

323

STOML2), cysteine proteases cathepsins (CSTB, CSTD, CSTL), virus replication (AKAP9, RDX,

324

MTCH1) and suppression of IFN-γ signaling (LARP1, RBX1 and TIMM8B) (Fig. 4C-F). Genes

325

contributing to virus entry (Fig. 4C,4D, Online Fig. IIC, IID), virus replication (Fig. 4F) and suppression

326

of IFN-γ signaling (Fig. 4E) were all up-regulated in CMs in failing hearts.

327

It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through the binding of its spike protein with ACE2

328

and subsequent S protein priming by host cell protease TMPRSS23130. To our surprise, we barely

329

detected any expression of TMPRSS2 in both normal and HF samples (Online Fig. IIE). Since it is

330

reported that in the absence of cell surface protease TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV can achieve cell entry via

331

an endosomal pathway in which it can be activated by other proteases such as cathepsin L30, we further

332

investigated gene expression dynamics of the endosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsins and found out

333

that CTSB, CTSD and CTSL were up-regulated significantly in CMs during HF (Fig. 4D). We also

334

detected that the expression levels of some inflammatory cytokines were increased in several subsets in

335

the HF patients, such as CXCL8 which was significantly increased in the subset of granulocytes and

336

NK-T cell/Monocytes as well as IL-32 which was increased in the subsets of NK-T cell/Monocytes and

337

endothelial cells, respectively (Online Fig. IIF).Thus, we speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may use the

338

ACE2-CTSB/L axis for cell entry in cardiac tissues. Together, these findings suggest that failing hearts

339

might be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

340

Thrombosis is commonly observed in severe COVID-19 patients32. Tissue factor (TF/CD142)

341

activation causes thrombus formation on atherosclerotic plaques coded by F333. We investigated the

342

expression dynamics of genes related to blood clotting. F3 was co-expressed with ACE2 and

343

significantly up-regulated in CM3 and CM1 during HF (Online Fig. IIG, IIH), suggesting that increased

344

F3 and ACE2 may contribute to the increased risk of thrombosis in HF patients.

Characteristics of ACE2-positive ventricular and atrial CMs, and NCMs

347

We further conducted GSEA analysis on DEGs of cells between ACE2+ and ACE2- in CM1 and CM4

348

(Fig. 5A, Online Fig. IIIA). GO terms associated with energy consumption (Fig. 5A), energy derivation

349

by oxidation (Fig. 5C), and pathway influenza infection (Online Fig. IIIC) and infectious disease

350

(Online Fig. IIIA) were positively enriched in ACE2+ cells. In contrast, GO terms associated with

351

interferon gamma-mediated signaling pathway, defense response to virus and interferon-alpha_beta

352

signaling and interferon signaling were negatively enriched in ACE2+ cells (Fig. 5C, Online Fig. IIIC).

353

We also performed GSEA analysis on DEGs of cells between ACE2+ and ACE2- in CM2 and CM3

354

(Fig. 5B, Online Fig. IIIB). GO terms associated with energy consumption, mitochondrial envelope,

355

ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, pathway cardiac muscle

356

contraction, and respiratory electron transport were positively enriched (Fig. 5B, 5C, Online Fig. IIIB,

357

IIIC). GO terms and pathways associated with innate immune response, response to interferon gamma,

358

interferon gamma signaling and interferon-alpha_beta signaling were negatively enriched, which are

359

consistent with the observation in ventricular CMs (Fig. 5D, Online Fig. IIID).

360

Moreover, we also identified DEGs between ACE2+ NCMs and ACE2- NCMs and performed GSEA

361

analysis on them (Online Fig. IV). Interestingly, pathways associated with infectious disease were

362

positively enriched in NCMs, except for NK-T Cells/Monocytes. GO terms associated with

363

mitochondrial matrix and ATP synthesis were positively enriched in smooth muscle cells, NK-T

364

with muscle structure and function (Online Fig. IVA, IVE) and leukocyte mediated immunity were

366

negatively enriched in ACE2+ cells of smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (Online

367

Fig. IVB). GO term associated with viral expression is positively enriched in ACE2+ granulocytes,

368

while GO term associated with immunocyte mediated immunity is negatively enriched in ACE2+

369

granulocytes and ACE2+ NK-T Cells/Monocytes. These findings suggest an impaired cellular

370

immunological response in HF patients, which may increase their vulnerability to various pathogens

371

(Online Fig. IVC, IVD).

372
373

Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 patients

374

The median age of these 91 COVID-19 patients was 66 years (range, [27-89]). 46 patients (50.5%) have

375

elevated BNP (≥100 pg/mL). HF patients have increased BNP plasma concentrations which are

376

generally corelated with the degree of cardiac dysfunction. Thus, BNP is often used as a biochemical

377

marker for HF34. Patients with a higher BNP were older (median age, 71 [IQR 44-89] vs. 62 [27-79],

378

p<0.0001) (Table 1). Compared with the lower BNP group, patients in the higher BNP group have

379

significantly higher levels of white blood cells (p<0.0001) and neutrophils (p<0.0001) , although

380

significantly lower number of lymphocytes (p<0.0001) (Table 1). The high BNP group has significant

381

increased procalcitonin (p<0.0001) and C-reactive protein (p<0.0001) as compared with the low BNP

382

group (Table 1). The high BNP group also showed imbalanced electrolyte levels and aberrant

383

coagulation profiles as compared with the low BNP group. Furthermore, more severe organ dysfunction

384

was observed in the high BNP group, including worse liver function indicated by higher aspartate

385

transaminase (p<0.03), direct bilirubin (p<0.005), and lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.0001) (Table 1)..

386

The high BNP group also showed worse renal function as indicated by a reduced glomerular filtration

387

rate (<0.0003) and increased blood urea nitrogen (p<0.0001) (Table 1). Cardiac TNI (p<0.0001) was

388

significantly increased in the higher BNP group, suggesting more cardiac injury in these patients (Table

389

1). Noteworthy, the high BNP group had a higher incidence of respiratory failure (RF, 31.43%,

390

p=0.0064) (Fig. 6A left), and a significantly increased mortality rate (58.70%, p<0.0001) (Fig. 6A

391

middle, Table 1), and a negative correlation with the lymphocyte count (Fig. 6A right). Infective

392

markers were positively correlated with the BNP level (Fig. 6B). Markers of coagulative disturbance

393

and organ impairment were positively correlated with the BNP level (Fig. 6C middle and right).

395

Discussion

396

The present research has several major findings. First, the study systematically investigated the ACE2

397

expression dynamics in ventricular CMs, atrial CMs, endothelial cells, fibroblast and leukocytes in

398

human normal and failing hearts at the single-cell level. We found that ACE2 was expressed in some,

399

but not all, of the ventricular and atrial CMs, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells in both

400

normal and failing hearts. Second, we demonstrated that ACE2 expression was selectively increased in

401

the dominant ventricular CM1 subset, an unusual ventricular CM4 subset, and the atrial CM3 subset.

402

The expression of ACE2 transcripts was also increased in these cells. Third, we demonstrated for the

403

first time that BNP and ANP transcripts are markedly enriched in ACE2+ CMs, while BNP, ANP, and

404

ACE2 can form a feedback loop associated with the RAAS/Ang II signaling pathway. Fourth, we

405

demonstrated for the first time that ACE2 expression was associated with the dynamic changes of a

406

group of genes specific for the networks of viral infection and immunity in cardiomyocytes. Moreover,

407

we found that compared with COVID-19 patients with a lower blood BNP, those with a higher BNP

408

had a significantly higher mortality rate and expression levels of inflammatory and infective markers

409

such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. These findings provide new insights to advance our

410

understanding of the potentially important roles of ACE2 and the associated critical signaling pathways

411

in regulating virus infection, immunologic responses, and associated cardiomyocyte injury in normal

412

and failing hearts.

413

One of the most interesting findings is that ACE2 was not equally expressed in all of the ventricular

414

and atrial CMs, but only expressed in ~5% normal ventricular or atrial CMs. ACE2 expression was

415

increased to 30% in the major ventricular CM1 subset in failing hearts. ACE2 was also increased in an

416

unusual ventricular CM4 subset and in the atrial CM3 subset but was unchanged in the atrial CM2

417

subset. Meanwhile, ACE2 expression was unchanged in the vascular endothelial subset but decreased

418

in the vascular smooth muscle subset in heart failure samples. Our finding that ACE2 was expressed in

419

normal hearts appears to contradict a previous report that pericytes (with marker genes ABCC9 and

420

KCNJ8), but not the cardiomyocytes express ACE2 in normal hearts35. The discrepancy may due to the

421

fact that the previous study used the single nucleus RNA-seq approach, which generally captures many

422

fewer transcripts as compared with the more sensitive and comprehensive SMART-seq using whole-

423

cell in our study. While it is difficult to fully understand the pathological role of the selective alterations

424

of ACE2 in particular cardiomyocyte subsets in the failing hearts, since ACE2 expression is required

425

for host cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus 36, in the context that SARS-CoV-2 causes

426

myocarditis and cardiac injury, it is reasonable to believe that the increased ACE2 in CMs in the failing

427

heart could exacerbate cardiac SARS-CoV-2 infection in HF patients. The finding that ACE2 was only

428

selectively expressed in a fraction of CMs suggest that not all of the CMs in the heart are equally

429

vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 injury. The selective SARS-CoV-2 infection in ACE2+ CMs could

430

certainly cause or exacerbate cardiac injury and consequent cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, the different

431

ACE2 expression and the potential selective injury to a group of ACE2+ atrial CMs could potentially

432

cause or exacerbate the cardiac arrhythmias that are commonly observed in HF patients. Whether

433

SARS-CoV-2 indeed selectively causes particular atrial and ventricular CMs certainly deserves further

434

investigations. Moreover, if our speculation regarding the increased cardiac arrhythmia in COVID-19

435

patients is correct, corresponding treatment should be developed.

436

In addition to its important role in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections, ACE2 plays an

437

important role in controlling the RAAS through converting Ang I and Ang II into Ang 1–9 and Ang 1–

438

7, respectively28, 37. Thus, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches in experimental studies

439

have defined a critical role for ACE2 in protecting the heart against HF, systemic and pulmonary

440

hypertension, myocardial infarction, and diabetic cardiomyopathy19,

441

support an important role for ACE2 in various cardiovascular diseases and ARDS, increasing/activating

442

ACE2 may protect against hypertension and CVD37,

443

demonstrated that when both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to ACE2 result in loss of ACE2

444

function, which is driven by endocytosis, activation of proteolytic cleavage and machining41, 42. If ACE2

445

indeed protects heart and lung function in COVID-19 patients, the ACE2 degradation by SARS-CoV-

446

2 infection contribute to the heart and lung dysfunction in these patients. In support of the above concern,

447

a recent study demonstrated that the plasma Ang-II level from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was

448

markedly elevated and the plasma Ang-II linearly correlated with the viral load and lung injury in

449

COVID-19 patients

450

Ang-II, and consequent activation of the AT1R axis 43. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that in

451

hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension, patient’s use of ACEI/ARB was associated with

452

lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB non-users42. Additional clinical and

453

experimental studies are clearly needed to define the role of ACE2 in cardiac and lung function in

454

COVID-19 patients, and to illustrate the detailed underlying molecular mechanism of cardiac injury

455

and HF in COVID-19 patients, as well as the mechanism of increased mortality rate in older patients

456

and HF patients in COVID-19 patients.

457

Another very interesting finding in the present study is that both BNP and ANP transcripts are markedly

458

enriched in ACE2+ CMs, and that BNP, ANP, and ACE2 can form a feedback loop associated with the

459

RAAS/Ang II signaling pathway. Interestingly, we found that DEGs between ACE2+ and ACE2-

460

ventricular myocytes showed that both BNP and ANP were the top two up-regulated genes. These

461

findings are consistent with the report that ANP and BNP play important roles in chronic HF by

462

synergizing with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system

463

(SNS)44. ANP and BNP are commonly used biomarkers for cardiac injury and HF. Circulating ANP

464

and BNP can promote diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation, which is critical for the maintenance of

465

intravascular volume homeostasis (Fig. 7B)20. In addition, GRN showed that ACE2, NPPA, NPPB,

466

AGT , TNNT1, TNNT2 and TNNT3 were well connected and shared the same upstream binding

467

transcription factors HAND2, MYOCD, MEF2C and TBX5, which imply that ACE2, ANP and BNP

468

might be co-regulated during HF development. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of

469

increased ANP and BNP in ACE2+ cells are not clear currently.

470

The finding that ACE2 expression was associated with the dynamic changes of a group of genes specific

471

to viral infection and immunity in cardiomyocytes is also very interesting. In particular, we compared

472

DEGs between failing CMs and normal CMs, as well as DEG between ACE2+ CMs with ACE- CMs.

473

Interestingly, GSEA analysis (GO and pathway) of DEGs for these two types of comparisons achieved

474

similar results, in which GO term/Pathway associated with viral infection and viral gene expression

475

were positively enriched in ACE2+ cells, while defense against the virus, secretion of IFN and

476

activation of the immune system were negatively enriched in ACE2+ CMs (Fig. 2B, 2C, 6A, 6B). These

477

results suggest that patients with heart dysfunction or HF may have a higher susceptibility to the

478

infection of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in general (Fig. 7A). Thus, the impact of ACE2 on SARS-

479

CoV-2 in cardiac tissues could be two-fold - facilitating the virus entry to CMs and the consequent

480

cardiomyocyte injury, and attenuating the overall virus defense capacity in cardiomyocytes. Therefore,

481

increased ACE2 in CMs in the failing heart would certainly make these CMs more vulnerable to SARS-

482

CoV-2.

483

Limitations.

484

First, the experimental approach used in the current study could not determine how ACE2 and NPs are

485

synergistically regulated during HF. However, the finding could certainly encourage further

486

investigation of the crosstalk among ACE2, ANP and BNP, as well as identifying the common

487

transcriptional factors for these genes. Second, the novel findings presented in this study are limited at

488

the transcriptional level. While the posttranscriptional regulation exerts critical roles in regulating the

489

biological function for many proteins, the scRNA-seq data have clearly provided new insights to

490

advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms for various clinical diseases. Finally, while

491

the present study certainly advances our understanding of ACE2 in the failing heart, the precise role of

492

cardiac ACE2 in regulating HF patients could not be defined. Further experimental and clinical studies

493

regarding ACE2 are warranted.
