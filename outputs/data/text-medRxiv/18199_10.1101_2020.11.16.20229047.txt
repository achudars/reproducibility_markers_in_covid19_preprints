Abstract

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly spreading globally since December 2019, triggering a
pandemic, soon after its emergence, with now more than one million deaths around the world.
While Iran was among the first countries confronted with rapid spread of virus in February, no
real-time SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome tracking is performed in the country.
To address this issue, we provided 50 whole-genome sequences of viral isolates ascertained from
different geographical locations in Iran during March-July 2020. The corresponding analysis on
origins, transmission dynamics and genetic diversity, represented at least two introductions of the
virus into the country, constructing two major clusters defined as B.4 and B.1*. The first entry of
the virus occurred around 26 December 2019, as suggested by the time to the most recent
common ancestor, followed by a rapid community transmission, led to dominancy of B.4 lineage
in early epidemic till the end of June. Gradually, reduction in dominancy of B.4 occurred
possibly as a result of other entries of the virus, followed by surge of B.1.* lineages, as of midMay.
Remarkably, variation tracking of the virus indicated the increase in frequency of D614G
mutation, along with B.1* lineages, which showed continuity till October 2020.
According to possible role of D614G in increased infectivity and transmission of the virus, and
considering the current high prevalence of the disease, dominancy of this lineage may push the
country into a critical health situation. Therefore, current data warns for considering stronger
prohibition strategies preventing the incidence of larger crisis in future.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now crossed one million deaths while infected
51,259,771 people worldwide as of 10 November 2020. The SARS-Cov-2 outbreak first
emerged in a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late December
2019 [1]. The first reported case out of China was detected in Thailand on January 13th 2020 and
the pandemic was announced by The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th 2020.
Real-time whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of emerging viruses can provide valuable
information about the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and, if combined with
epidemiological data, can accurately evaluate the magnitude of transmission and therefore offer
insights for management and efficient responses to control the outbreak in a region [2]. Along
with this knowledge, real-time whole-genome sequencing of this emerging virus was
commenced at the early phase of outbreak globally and an increasing number of sequences are
being deposited in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) [3]. In addition to
the outbreak tracing and investigating the phylodynamics and evolutionary events of SARSCoV-2, these data provide beneficial information for adapting more specific diagnostic tests,
therapeutic approaches and vaccines.
Iran was among the first countries confronting the rapid virus spread, which in a little while
became a concerning issue in the country. The first COVID-19 confirmed patient and death
report from the disease was announced on a same day on 19 February 2020 in Qom city. Local
transmission to the other neighboring provinces was reported just a day after and then the disease
spread shortly Iran-wide. The first outbreak peak dropped in April, but soon after relaxing the
lockdown, the country experienced another increase in the number of cases in May. As of 10
November, 692,949 infected cases and 38,749 deaths have been reported officially and there is a
concern about the increase in mortality rate in autumn, which is now estimated to around ~7%
according to official statistics (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iran/).
Although the outbreak initiation in Iran was among the first ones in February along with the Italy
and South Korea outbreaks, no real-time SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome tracking has been
performed in the country so far. The first whole-genome sequence of the virus from Iran was
deposited in GISAID database (EPI_ISL_424349) on 4 April 2020. In the same month, the study
by Eden et al. revealed three major substitutions of G1397A, T28688C, and G29742T in
genomes of patients with travel history to Iran, which constitute a distinct clade representative of
the specific viral diversity present in Iran at that time [4].
To date, there are only eight complete genomes available in GISAID, not sufficient for tracking
the virus in the country. Therefore, we performed genome-sequencing of 50 SARS-CoV-2
samples ascertained from different geographical locations and time intervals in Iran. We aimed at
extending the understanding of the origins and transmission dynamics, circulating lineages and
variation tracking of SARS‐CoV‐2 outbreak in Iran, using molecular and phylogenetic methods.

Material and Methods:
Specimen Recruitment
We recruited 50 SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples, obtained as part of clinical testing in different
COVID-19 referral centers of the following provinces in Iran; Alborz (n=2), Ardabil (n=4),
Gilan (n=6), Tehran (n=27), Khuzestan (n=3), Qom (n=1), Sistan and Baluchestan (n=3) and
South Khorasan (n=4). All patients had been referred between March-July 2020 with the clinical
presentations of the COVID-19 disease and were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by realtime RT-PCR assay at the corresponding local centers.

Sequencing and Genome assembly
Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples was performed by targeted
enrichment including reverse transcription (RT) reaction for cDNA synthesis, followed by target
enrichment and library preparation using CleanPlex® SARS-CoV-2 Research and Surveillance
Panel (Paragon Genomics, Inc.). All samples were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq
instrument using 300-cycle MiSeq v2 reagent kits (Illumina, Inc.) and eventually 5.4 Gb of raw
data with 94.5% of bases with >=Q30 were generated. Initially, the quality of FastQ files was
assessed using the FastQC program [5] and then preprocessed using Fastp [6]. The sequences
were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512.2) using Bowtie2 [7], keeping
the reads mapped in proper pair. The resultant filtered bam files were used for assembly of
consensus SARS-CoV-2 sequences using samtools mpileup and bcftools[8]. Finally, the
consensus FastQ files were converted into Fasta format using the seqtk program
(https://github.com/lh3/seqtk), masking bases with quality lower than 20 to ambiguous
nucleotides (N).

Lineage assignment
In addition to the 50 sequenced samples in this project, 8 other full genome SARS-CoV-2
sequences from Iran in GISAID database, which were collected between March-May 2020, were
subjected to lineage assignment. We tried Pangolin v2.0.7 (https://pangolin.docs.cog-uk.io/) [9],
CoV-GLUE
(http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#home)
[10]
and
NextClade
v.0.6.0
(https://clades.nextstrain.org/) [11] to assign the global lineages present in Iranian SARS-CoV-2
outbreak. Pangolin and CoV-GLUE estimate lineages based on the methodology described by
Rambaut et al. [9] as a dynamic nomenclature system to identify SARS-CoV-2 lineages.
However, the NextClade estimates according to the five major clades used on Nextstrain
(https://nextstrain.org/) presenting large scale and more stable diversity patterns. Therefore, we
assigned both lineage nomenclature systems on our samples [12].

Phylogenetic analysis
We used BEAST v1.10.4 for phylogenetic analysis and estimating the most recent common
ancestor (TMRCA) [13]. First, the consensus sequences of each sample were evaluated by
NextClade v.0.6.0 [11] and the sequences containing >5% ambiguous nucleotides (N) and
bearing private mutations more than the expected number, were excluded from the downstream
analysis. To explore the temporal signal of the data, the remaining high quality Fasta files were
aligned by MAFFT v7.407 using the FFT-NS-2 algorithm [14] and then a maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic tree was built by applying IQ-TREE v2.1.1 with the GTR+gamma model [15]. The
temporal signal was explored by TempEst providing a root-to-tip regression plot [16].
Eventually, BEAST v1.10.4 was applied to estimate TMRCA and construct a Bayesian
phylogenetic tree of the remaining 45 sequences, plus Wuhan-1 patient (EPI_ISL_402125) as an
outgroup, using a simple model consisting of HKYγ codon partitioned 1 + 2, 3 substitution
model, strict clock and coalescent exponential growth tree prior. Maximum clade credibility
(MCC) tree was then made using TreeAnnotator with 10% burn-in from two separate Markov
chain-Monte Carlo runs, explored by Tracer v1.7.1[17] and combined by LogCombiner from the
BEAST package [13].
To trace possible sources of SARS-CoV-2 entry into Iran, an additional phylogenetic tree was
constructed based on a total of 261 samples including a list of high-quality genomes in GISAID
[18] from the start of epidemic till the end of February, and random subsets of samples in
GISAID during March-June interval available as of September 27 and selected using mothur
[19].

Variant analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of Iranian outbreak
Variant analysis was performed by CoV-GLUE, relative to the reference sequence
(NC_045512.1)[10]. In total, 53 samples were investigated after excluding the sequences bearing
private mutations above the threshold. Moreover, to track the renowned D614G mutation
frequency, Sanger sequencing of additional 67 SARS-CoV2 positive samples collected during
July-October, was performed using the following primer pairs designed by ARTIC network [20];
5’-CCAGCAACTGTTTGTGGACCTA-3’ and 5’-CAGCCCCTATTAAACAGCCTGC-3’.

Results:
Genome assembly and Data availability
In this study, we obtained 44 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 sequences (>98% of the genome is
complete) from the Iranian outbreak. The remaining 6 samples covered >82% of the
NC_045512.2 genome sequence. These sequences have been deposited in the GISAID database
(EpiCoV). The metadata information including the geographical location, collection date, the
percentage of ambiguous nucleotides (N) for each genome, the percentage of genome coverage
compared to NC_045512.2 and the exact lineages defined for each sample are provided in
TableS1.

Lineage assignment
Lineage assignment with Pangolin v2.0.7 and CoV-GLUE, although slightly different for some
samples, both yielded B.4 as the dominant lineage circulating in Iranian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
till June; comprising 63.8% and 74% of all 58 samples studied through the March-July interval,
respectively (see Figure 1A for spectrum of circulating lineages and TableS1 for exact lineage of
each sample).
This is consistent with previous reports[4] as also the majority (83%) of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
in GISAID that were primarily exposed in Iran, belonged to the B.4 lineage (TableS2).
In addition, the allocated lineages provided by NextClade v0.6.0 showed a dominancy of the
19A major clade (77.6%) which with 19B comprised the most prevalent clades during the early
phase of the outbreak, especially in Asia. The dominancy of this clade in the Iranian outbreak is
consistent with Iran being one of the first countries infected by the virus.
The A.3 lineages (Figure 1A) allocated by Pangolin are assumed to be not correct due to the
lower quality of corresponding sequences. The B.4 lineage is more probable, as predicted by
CoV-GLU and also supported by those samples all carrying the G1397A, T28688C, and
G29742T substitutions [4].
Therefore, our results confirm B.4 as the dominant lineage in Iranian outbreak during the
February-June interval and introduces B, B.1.* and B.4 as the current circulating lineages in the
country.
On the other hand, sequencing more SARS-CoV-2 samples from the end of June onward is
required to evaluate whether B.4 still persists as the dominant lineage. The current data (Figure
1B, 1C, 1D) already exhibit a trend towards the appearance of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages and
reduction in dominancy of B.4. As of May, the 20A clade, being the dominant European clade in
early 2020, started to appear and more B.1* lineages observed in the Iranian epidemic. This is
explicable by new sources of virus entries to the country at that time interval. Its appearance
could also be due to SARS-CoV-2 genome mutations in the existing Iranian B lineages, which
were circulating alongside the B.4 lineage in early phase of the epidemic, although with a lower
proportion.

Phylogenetic Analysis
SARS-CoV-2 entry and circulating lineages
The phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Iranian outbreak clearly revealed two
different circulating clusters (Figure 2), suggesting at least two separate introductions into the
country.
The older green cluster is comprised of 36 genomes almost all of the B.4 lineage or 19A clade
[B.4 / 19A], carrying [G1397A-T28688C-G29742T] substitutions [4]. These genomes were
spread across different geographical regions including; Alborz (n=2), Gilan (n=4), Khuzestan
(n=3), Qom (n=1), Sistan and Baluchestan (n=3), Semnan (n=1), South Khorasan (n=1), Tehran
(n=18) and unknown (n=3). This indicates that the [B.4/19A] cluster originated very early and
began circulating around the country thereafter, reflecting multiple local transmissions.
Additionally, there are 2 samples with [B/19A] lineage in this older cluster. These samples were
collected back in early March, showing that in the first phase of pandemic; at least two different
lineages entered into the country. The [B/19A] samples also carry the G1397A and G29742T
substitutions but not T28688C.
The red cluster is comprised of 9 genomes all with the [B.1.*/20A] lineage and collected after
May 15th, compatible with the pattern shown in Figure 1. The [B.1.*/20A] samples did not show
[G1397A-T28688C-G29742T] substitutions but instead harbored [C241T-C3037T-C14408TA23403G] or [C241T-C3037T-C14408T-A23403G-G25563T], which are the common patterns
of variant co-occurrence of B.1 and B.1.* lineages in Europe and North America [21].
TMRCA Estimates
The median date of the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of 45 high-quality
SARS-CoV2 genomes from Iran was estimated as 2019-12-26 with 95% highest posterior
density (HPD) intervals of [2019-11-17 to 2020-01-16].
Additionally, to track the appearance of [B.1.*/20A] cluster in the country, the TMRCA of the
nine B.1 samples, placing other samples as outgroup was estimated. The TMRCA was 2020-0222, with HPD intervals of [2020-01-12 to 2020-03-29]. Clearly, more high-quality B.1* genomes
are required to narrow the credible interval and predict a more precise TMRCA for entry of this
lineage. However, the above results still indicate that the new lineage might have been
introduced separately, after the entry of B.4, and then gradually increased in the population,
becoming detectable in our cohort since mid-May.

Sources of SARS-CoV-2 entries
Subsequent analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Iranian outbreak in the context of 216
set of genomes from around the world, clarified the location of the two main clusters among the
global samples (Figure 3).
As expected, the B.4 cluster (highlighted in light green) was linked to the early samples collected
in January-February and mostly in China. This supports the hypothesis of very early virus
introduction to Iran and most likely from China, which is consistent with Iran’s health ministry
statements that the virus was brought from China by travelers[22].
Interestingly, the Iranian B.4 cluster is closely linked to the two B.4 samples collected on midJanuary (2020-01-19 and 2020-01-18) in Hubei/Wuhan and Shandong/Qingdao in China
(EPI_ISL_408482 and EPI_ISL_412981). This suggests that the three [G1397A-T28688CG29742T] substitutions occurred before their introduction to Iran, subsequently becoming the
major lineage and driving the epidemic in the country (Figure 3, Figure 4).
Afterwards, the virus was transferred to the other countries, such as Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand, by travelers [4]. This is now confirmed by locating five samples from these countries
within the major Iranian cluster (EPI_ISL_412965, EPI_ISL_413213, EPI_ISL_412975,
EPI_ISL_413214, and EPI_ISL_413490). All these five samples were collected in late February,
having a travel history to Iran (Figure 3, Figure 4).
The [B.1.*/20A] cluster (highlighted in light red) localizes in a completely different position,
namely among the samples from various parts of the world, prominently Europe (Figure 3,
Figure 4). This corroborates the hypothesis of new sources of virus introduction to the country
(probably in late February as suggested by TMRCA of B.1* samples) before suspension of air
flights; as foreign and Iranian airlines transferring passengers between Iran, Europe and North
America were suspended on February 25th and March 8th, respectively.

Variant analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of Iranian outbreak
Common SARS-CoV2 variants
We detected 14 different variants with >10% frequency in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Iranian
outbreak (Table1). Notably, just four variants, namely G1397A, T28688C, G29742T and
G11083T, contributed to >70% of samples; comprising the common co-occurrence of variants;
[G1397A-T28688C-G29742T] in B.4 lineage.
The G11083T variant is one of the most frequent mutations observed in Asia from December
2019 till March 2020 [21, 23] and, not surprisingly, is observed mostly along with the 3
substitutions constituting the B.4 lineage.
Other less frequent variants were observed in ~19% of samples constituting the known cooccurrence of variants; [C241T-C3037T-C14408T-A23403G] and [C241T-C3037T-C14408TA23403G-G25563T], occurring in clade G (B.1) which is prevalent in Europe, Oceania, South
America, and Africa and clade GH (B.1.*), prevalent in North America [21].
Novel SARS-CoV-2 variants
Remarkably, we observed two specific haplotypes; the co-occurrence of [G20887A-C28830TC21627T] and [G8653T-C884T] variants in 17% and 11% of samples, respectively (Table1).
Both groups also carried B.4 [G1397A-T28688C-G29742T] variants. These haplotypes are less
frequent in CoV-GLU and 48,635 genomes investigated by Mercatelli & Giorgi [10, 21].
Therefore, we conclude that the observation of these variants with the [G1397A, T28688C, and
G29742T] is not a common feature worldwide. However, further investigations are required to
assess their extent of significance into SARS-CoV2 genetic diversity in Iran.
Analysis of viral isolates also revealed 4 samples harboring unique variants (Table1), not
detected in sequences from SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in CoV-GLUE and also not in 48,635
complete genomes investigated by Mercatelli and Giorgi [10, 21]. Among these, the C28388G
(Q39E) variant is located in Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), which is one of the essential
SARS-CoV2 proteins having role in packaging the RNA genome of the virus into capsid and
therefore playing an important role in SARS-CoV2 self-assembly [24].
Although the exact variants were unique, different missense variants at the same location were
identified in other viral sequences around the world.

Variants located in Spike (S) protein
Spike glycoprotein is the key protein mediating the entry of the virus to the cell and therefore the
target of most vaccine strategies [25]. We thus focused on variants located in the spike protein of
viral isolates from Iran. We identified spike variants in 28 samples (53%), in which D614G and
T22I variants were occurring at higher frequencies of 24.5% and 17%, respectively (Table2).
The T22I was only observed in B.4/19A cluster and the D614G mutation occurred mostly in
[B.1.* / 20A] cluster.
The D614G variant, being the most prevalent mutation in the sequenced genomes around the
world, was also the most prevalent spike mutation in viral isolates from Iran, while showing an
increasing trend from mid-May and locating mostly within the [B.1.* / 20A] cluster. In
accordance with this, most of our samples with D614G mutation were harboring [C241TC3037T-C14408T] or [C241T-C3037T-C14408T-G25563T].
Remarkably, co-occurrence of D614G mutation with B.4 [G1397A-T28688C-G29742T] and
G11083T variants was also observed in three samples.
Moreover, Sanger sequencing of additional 67 SARS-CoV2 positive samples confirmed the
increase in D614G frequency till October, becoming the dominant mutation in the Iranian
outbreak (Figure 5).

Discussion
The current study is the first comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes in Iranian
outbreak. Regarding the importance of real-time sequencing of emerging viruses, and lack of full
genome in Iran, this study was designed to provide 50 SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequences of
the epidemic in Iran.
Lineage assignment and phylogenetic analysis of these sequences clarified the origins and
transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Iran, in which two major introductions into
the country was detected, constructing two major clusters of the virus in different times, followed
by rapid community transmission throughout the country.
This study confirms the B.4 as the dominant lineage in Iran, from the start of the epidemic till the
end of June. This lineage was primarily introduced as a prevalent distinct clade in Australian
travelers from Iran in early April [4]. Since then, it is recognized as the Iranian epidemic.
Nonetheless, no specific study on Iranian SARS-CoV-2 samples was performed so far, which is
addressed in this study.

Furthermore, the estimated median date of the time to the most recent common ancestor in this
study indicates the possibility of cryptic transmission of the virus or presence of misdiagnosed
patients for more than one month prior to the report of first cases of the COVID-19 disease in the
country.
Therefore, the B.4 lineage originated first in late-2019/early-2020 followed by multiple local
transmissions, developing the major SARS-CoV-2 clade in the beginning of outbreak. Our data
suggest a reduction in B.4 dominancy, followed by a surge of B.1.* lineages which has been
exported from Europe globally. This new cluster might be explained by new sources of virus
entries before suspension of flights in late February or being the mutant product of B lineage in
early phase.
In addition to outbreak tracing, these full genome sequences can provide beneficial information
in understanding the genome diversity of viral isolates in Iran, helpful in adapting more specific
diagnostic tests, therapeutic approaches and vaccines.
Generally, RNA viruses are known to have a high mutation rate, which is explained by lack of
proofreading activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). However, coronaviruses are
among the exceptions, with lower mutation rates due to the presence of RdRp-independent
proofreading activity [26, 27]. The mutation rate of 1.12 × 10-3 mutations per site-year [23] and
the average number of 7.23 mutations per sample [21], are in support of the moderate mutation
rate of SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS-CoV-1.
Variation tracking of the viral isolates has shown that some SARS-CoV-2 mutations- such as
P323L and D614G- are distributed globally while some other ones are accumulated in specific
geographical regions [28].
Investigation of prevalent mutations in Iran indicated the co-occurrence of some widespread
mutations consistent with the two main lineages in the country. Furthermore, the unique
mutations and also haplotypes of [G20887A-C28830T-C21627T] or [G8653T-C884T] along
with the known [G1397A-T28688C-G29742T] mutations, were identified in low proportion of
samples. Therefore, none of those could be considered as adapted geographically in Iranian
SARS-CoV-2 samples. Indeed, massive sequencing of a larger cohort is a requisite for
investigating the significance of these variants. Moreover, the impact of these country-specific
variants (yet to be defined) on the behavior of virus (replication efficiency, virulence. etc.) needs
further investigation.
Despite the relatively low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 genome, still a total of 353,341
mutations were identified in 48,635 SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared to the NC_045512.2 as of
July 2020 [21]. Among these, studying the mutations in the spike protein are of great importance,
as this immunogenic structural protein mediates the virus entry to the host cells via interacting
with cellular receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and as it plays a key
role in induction of neutralizing antibodies [29, 30]. This glycoprotein is composed of two
functional subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunits contain a receptor binding domain (RBD)
through which SARS-Co-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, while S2 is responsible for virus-host
membrane fusion [31]. Furthermore, the spike protein is the target for many vaccine candidates

currently in development and therefore tracking the mutations in this protein (especially RBD
region) is crucial [30].
Monitoring the spike mutations in Iranian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed no novel mutations in
this genomic region, while determined two commonly known mutations; T22I and D614G. Both
of these variants are outside RBD region, suggesting no negative effect for efficacy of the future
vaccines on the viral lineages currently circulating in Iran, similar to other countries as discussed
by Dearlove et al. [30].
While the known T22I mutation is less frequent in other regions, the D614G variant is now the
most prevalent mutation in COVID-19 pandemic [21, 25, 27, 32, 33]. Recent studies suggested a
fitness advantage for G614, rapidly making it the dominant form in each geographical location
[25, 32]. This might be the result of a significant conformational change in spike protein caused
by G614, leading to more feasible virus-host cell membrane fusion. As a consequence, increased
infectivity, transmission and replication fitness is reported for G614 [33]. However, there are still
some debates about the transmission effect of D614G variant [34, 35] but it is recently shown
that the mutation is not related to increased disease severity and does not reduce the effect of
neutralizing antibodies [32, 36].
Notably, in accordance with the increasing [B.1*/20A] clade among the viral isolates of the
Iranian epidemic as of mid-May, the D614G variant is dominating in the population. This can
partly explain the accelerated transmission of the virus in recent months, although the negative
effect of relaxed quarantine policies should not be overlooked.
Due to the strong fitness of G614, we could also observe its co-occurrence with common B.4
variants, while the mutation is known as always co-occurring with variants defining the G clade
[21].
In conclusion, genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2
entered to Iran, in very late 2019 and circulated among vulnerable patients. Now, the increase in
frequency of D614G mutation during the course of pandemic predicts a critical situation and
raises a significant warning alarm for considering stronger prohibition strategies in the country.
