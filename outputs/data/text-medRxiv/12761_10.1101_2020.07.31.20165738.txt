ABSTRACT
Background: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has spread rapidly across
the globe. Accurate clinical characterisation studies conducted early in the pandemic are
essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts. In this scoping
review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early

months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical
outcomes.
Methods: A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were
searched for studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which
reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included.
Results: Of 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion;
one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients
admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10%
in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients
from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication
in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of
anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common
in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature was
underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory
biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical
computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in
early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were
limited.
Conclusions: Clinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that
covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy.
However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect
this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used.
Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without
fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults. Further characterisation studies in
different at-risk populations is needed.

outcomes, pandemic research

BACKGROUND
The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing the acute respiratory disease covid-19 has
spread globally. As the pandemic has progressed, data have emerged indicating that covid19 might present without the common symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnoea reported early
on during the pandemic and as defined in the WHO clinical case definition[1]. Non-respiratory
symptoms have been described increasingly, such as gastrointestinal[2], cardiovascular[3],
and neurological symptoms[4]. Biochemical markers and imaging can be important for aiding
decision making by identifying patients at risk of severe disease or complications and for
optimising patient care. Identifying the spectrum of covid-19 clinical presentations,
biochemical markers and imaging findings may assist timely identification of infection and
inform clinical management and public health interventions. The aim of this review is to
characterise the clinical presentation, biochemical and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes
of covid-19 disease from studies published early in the epidemic. The review will also highlight
gaps in our knowledge to inform future covid-19 research efforts.
METHODS
To identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 globally,
we performed a scoping evidence review, drawing on the PRISMA extension for scoping
review guidelines (Figure 1).
Search strategy
The following databases were searched from inception to 28 April 2020 for relevant studies:
MEDLINE; EMBASE and Global Health. The search terms were: (covid-19 OR SARS-CoV-2
OR 2019-nCoV OR novel coronavirus) AND (clinical OR hospital OR admitted) AND

(characteristics OR features OR symptoms OR signs), without any further restrictions. The
electronic database results were supplemented with a Google Scholar search on the 28 April
2020 with the first 100 results screened for inclusion.
Screening and eligibility
Two reviewers independently screened the title and abstract of all the retrieved search
results, after de-duplication. The full text of the articles that passed the first stage for
inclusion were divided and screened by five individual reviewers. Studies presenting clinical
data on patients admitted to hospital (ward or ICU) with covid-19 in any hospital globally
were included. Due to the number of articles identified studies which presented fewer than
100 covid-19 cases were excluded to ensure comprehensive data. Articles not published in
English were excluded due to constraints in reliably translating clinical data.
Data synthesis
A standardised form for data extraction was developed and piloted by the reviewers before
being finalised. A second reviewer independently checked the extracted data. The data
extraction and synthesis were performed using Microsoft Excel. Data on study source,
month of publication, period when cases were collected, patient demographic, clinical signs
and symptoms on admission, biochemical laboratory and imaging results and outcomes
were extracted by one reviewer. A second reviewer independently checked the extracted
data. The tabulated data were analysed and synthesised by all reviewers.

RESULTS
A total of 77 observational studies and one randomised controlled trial (RCT) presenting
clinical data on 77,443 patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 in seven countries were
included and presented in this review (Figure 1). The majority of studies were from China
(82%), followed by the USA (9%), Italy (4%), France (3%) and the UK (3%). China, the USA
and the UK contributed 39%, 36% and 22% of patients, respectively. Two studies were set in
more than one country, with one including patients from both the US and China, (n =424
patients) and one study including patients from Belgium, France, Italy and Spain (n=417
patients). (Table 1 and Figure 2). There were no studies including samples from populations
in low and middle income countries (LMICs). The earliest data of admitted patients were

collected from the 21st November 2019 and the latest cohort of data were collected up
until18th April 2020.
In the included studies, 68% (n=53) presented clinical data on adults only, 1% (n=1) on
children only (<18 years), 23% (n=18) on both adults and children, 1% (n=1) on older adults
and 1% (n=1) on pregnant women. A summary table of all included studies is available. (See

Clinical presentation

The clinical presentation of covid-19 includes a wide spectrum of disease manifestations.
The most commonly reported symptom in the included studies was fever, reported in 77% of
articles, followed by cough in 71% of articles. These symptoms, both part of the clinical case
definition of covid-19, had a wide prevalence range reported across studies. The highest
prevalence of fever (98.6%) was reported in a study of 138 patients with a median age of
56[5] and the highest prevalence of cough (87%) was reported in a study of 114 patients
with a mean age of 47.[6] The lowest prevalence of both fever (8.9%) and cough (4%) was
reported in a study by Lovell et al. of 101 palliative patients with a median age of 81.6
Dyspnoea was the third most reported symptom, included in 62% of all studies. The highest
reported prevalence of dyspnoea (80%) was in a study of 178 patients, of which 75% were
50 years or older.[7] The lowest reported prevalence of dyspnoea (0.8%) was in a
retrospective study of 118 patients with mean age of 44 years.

Other commonly reported symptoms included fatigue, reported in 47% of articles, myalgia in
42%, sore throat in 40%, chest pain in 25%, rhinorrhoea in 22%, and expectoration in 13%.
Noticeably, many patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhoea which was
reported in 58% of articles, nausea and/or vomiting (40%) and appetite changes (16%).
Gastrointestinal symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms were reported in 4% of
patients on admission in a cohort of 16,749 covid-19 patients in the UK.[8] Neurological
symptoms were also reported in patients, including headache in 44% of articles, altered
mental state in 10%, and smell or taste disturbances in 4%. The most commonly reported
symptoms and the studies reporting the highest and lowest prevalence of each are reported
below (Table 2).

In addition, covid-19 complications and their associated symptoms may be the presenting
features of the disease. In a study of 214 covid-19 infected patients, acute cerebrovascular
events affected 2.8% of included participants, with two of these patients presenting to the

most common laboratory finding among patients admitted to hospital with confirmed covid19, being reported in 32% (25/78) of studies[11, 21, 30-35]. The highest prevalence of
lymphocytopenia (99.1%) was reported in a study of 225 patients with a mean age of 50
years[36]. The second most commonly reported laboratory finding was elevated C-reactive
protein (CRP) in 19% (15/78) of studies. The highest prevalence of elevated CRP (91.9%)
was reported in a study of 140 patients with a mean age of 57 years[37].
Other abnormal laboratory findings included thrombocytopenia, elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, troponin and cytokine
levels, particularly interleukin 6 (IL-6). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) were both elevated, and decreased albumin and leukopenia were
reported in several studies[11, 21, 30-35, 38-41]. (Table 3)
The largest study identified which reported laboratory results presented data on 5700 adults
and children with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to hospitals in New
York. Most of these results were collected within 24 hours of admission.[33] This study
reported that 60% (n=3387) of patients presented with lymphocytopenia, 58% (n=3263) had
elevated AST, 39% (n=2176) elevated ALT, 22.6% (n=801) and an elevated troponin I or
troponin T. This study also showed evidence of elevated BNP (median = 385 pg/mL, n=
1818), D-dimer (median= 438 ng/mL, n= 3169), procalcitonin (median= 0.2ng/mL, n=4138),
LDH (median= 404 U/L, n=4003), and ferritin (median= 798 ng/mL, n=4344)[33].
In studies which compared laboratory values among mild and severe cases of covid-19,
those with severe disease were found to have more prominent lab abnormalities including
lower lymphocyte counts, higher inflammatory marker levels, (CRP, ESR, LDH), and
elevated D-dimer levels and liver enzymes (AST, ALT) [17, 31, 34, 35, 42-44]. Among
studies that reported immune markers, higher levels of serum cytokines and lower levels of
T lymphocytes were associated with disease severity[35, 43].

Imaging findings
Imaging findings were reported in 44 studies. Common abnormalities seen on computed
tomography (CT) at admission included ground glass opacities and consolidation (Table 4)
[5, 31, 34, 36, 50-52]. These lesions were predominantly bilateral[31, 34, 48, 53, 54] and
frequently affected the lower lobes[21, 47, 54, 55]. Reported prevalence of ground glass
opacities ranged from 12.1% to 96% in the included studies[31, 46]. Other frequently
reported covid-19 CT imaging features include a peripheral distribution of lesions[16, 25, 46,
56, 57], and multi-lobar involvement[23, 35, 54, 55]. The prevalence of lesions in two or
more lobes ranged from 35.8% to 94.6%[21, 35]. Less common CT abnormalities include

pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy[25, 31, 58]. Abnormal CT findings were more
prevalent in those with severe disease[17, 31, 35, 40].
The included studies demonstrated that imaging findings may be normal in early or mild
disease. In a study of 298 laboratory confirmed patients, 14.8% (44/298) of all patients had a
normal chest CT on admission[17]. CT imaging was more likely to be normal the sooner it
was conducted after symptom onset[17]. In a study of 121 laboratory confirmed patients,
56% (n=20/36) of patients had a normal CT scan 0 to 2 days post-symptom onset[57], while
a study of 112 patients reported a normal scan in 21% (n=10/47) of patients 0 to 4 days
post-symptom onset[59]. A study of 543 patients admitted to a Chinese hospital found that
the median time from symptom onset to the diagnosis of pneumonia on CT was 4 days[35].
Disease progression on repeated imaging was reported in a small number of studies. In a
study of 248 confirmed cases who had repeated radiological examination, 66% (n=163/248)
showed disease progression after a median of 3 days[60], while in a study of 149 patients
where 17 had initial normal radiological findings, 29% (5/17) had disease progression on
imaging after a median of 7 days[46].
There were 10 studies which reported both CT and chest X-ray findings[17, 21, 27, 28, 42,
44, 48, 50, 58, 60]. The prevalence of abnormalities was greater with CT imaging in studies
that reported findings of both modalities. In a cohort of 1,590 laboratory confirmed patients
from multiple hospitals in China, 15% (n=243/1590) of chest X-ray findings on admission
were abnormal compared to 71% (n=1130/1590) of CT results.[28] In a study of 1099
laboratory confirmed patients, 59% (n=162/274) of those who had a chest X-ray on
admission demonstrated abnormalities compared to 86% (n=840/975) of those who had a
CT[42]. Other studies which reported both CT and X-ray imaging did not individually present
results, instead combining the two modalities when reporting imaging abnormalities[17, 21,
44, 48, 50, 60].

Outcomes
Mortality rate among hospitalised cases was reported to be up to 33%[8], with higher
mortality rates observed in studies of ICU patients ranging from 45%[8] to 50%.[61]
Commonly documented complications and adverse outcomes included acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) [14, 48, 50, 60], ICU treatment[2, 6, 11, 14, 19, 28, 33, 41, 42,
48, 50, 55, 60, 62, 63], mechanical ventilation[11, 28, 33, 41], and death[2, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12,
14, 15, 17-20, 25-27, 30-36, 38-41, 44, 46, 48, 50-53, 55, 60-69]. Several studies reported
that older patients were more prone to serious adverse outcomes, with age a documented
risk factor for ARDS[48], ICU admission[60] and in-hospital mortality[8, 14, 30, 31, 34, 51,
64].
Males were reported as more susceptible to these adverse outcomes, and in a study of 1591
laboratory confirmed ICU patients set in Italy, 82% (n=1304/1591) were male[64]. This was
corroborated in another four studies reporting higher mortality rates and disease severity for
men amongst critically[8, 33, 51] and non-critically ill patients[40], including in a study of

16,747 patients from the UK which found that female sex was significantly associated with a
reduced risk of mortality (hazard ratio 0.80 [95% CI 0.72, 0.89]) compared to male[8]. A large
multi-site study of 5700 patients in New York did not document any deaths in patients under
20 years[33].
Reporting of haematological complications was limited, and only one study from China
reported coagulopathy observed in 19% (n=37/191) of patients[50]. Renal complications
were reported, with Cheng et al.[41] documenting acute kidney injury (AKI) in 5.1%
(n=36/701) of patients. In this study, AKI was found to be an independent predictor of inhospital death[41]. AKI was also documented as a complication in 15% (n=28/191) of 191
hospitalised patients.[50] Cardiovascular complications were also reported, and in a study of
393 patients, arrythmias and myocardial infarction was reported in 7.4% and 3.6% of
patients, respectively[39]. In a European study including patients from four countries,
olfactory dysfunction was prevalent in 63% of patients with clinically resolved infection[29].
Corticosteroid use was higher in patients with severe disease[11, 17, 31, 53]. Rates of
corticosteroid use ranged up to 73%[38]. Respiratory support status in patients receiving
corticosteroids was not reported in any study. A study of 548 patients reported that high
dose corticosteroids was associated with increased risk of death[35], while several other
studies suggested high doses were associated with poor clinical outcomes[31, 50, 67]. Most
studies did not recommend the use of corticosteroids due to absence of reliable
evidence[18, 51, 60]. Anticoagulant administration was reported in only one study of 449
patients[65]. This study demonstrated that in those patients with elevated D-dimer, there was
a significantly lower mortality rate in those patients administered heparin compared to those
who were not.

DISCUSSION
In this scoping review we present clinical characteristics of more than 77,000 people
admitted to hospital with covid-19 in seven countries, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and
imaging findings and clinical outcomes.
Although fever and cough were the most commonly reported symptoms they may not be
present all the time in patients across all age-ranges. For instance, in the study by Lovell et
al. of 101 elderly palliative care patients, less than ten percent presented with fever or
cough[15]. This is also consistent with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and
emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) database which demonstrates a lower proportion of
older adults presented with fever, cough and dyspnoea compared to younger adults[70].
These data indicate that the covid-19 clinical syndrome may vary with age, with older adults
presenting differently and that further clinical characterisation is needed in this age group.
Furthermore, these data have shown that patients may present with non-respiratory
symptoms, as described in the ISARIC report where 4% of patients presented with
gastrointestinal symptoms alone[8]. The findings show relying solely on respiratory
symptoms would potentially misdiagnose the condition particularly in children/adolescents
and in elderly patients.
Laboratory and imaging findings are also diverse, and although CT is more sensitive in
detecting lung abnormalities it can also be normal early on in the disease[17, 57, 59].
Although lymphocytopenia and ground glass opacities on CT were the most frequently
reported laboratory and radiological findings, these abnormalities may be absent at
presentation and therefore normal findings alone cannot rule out covid-19. The wide
variation in prevalence of abnormal findings in hospitalised patients may be partly due to the
difference in populations included and timing of sampling, but also shows emerging evidence
of multiple organs being affected. These biochemical data indicate increased risk of
inflammatory and thromboembolic disease, and are in line with suggestions that SARS-CoV2 induces ARDS and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Immunomodulatory

drugs may be beneficial through controlling inflammation, but their use must be balanced
against the theoretical risk of allowing uncontrolled pathogen replication[71] .
One study focussed solely on evaluating the clinical characteristics of children[72], and
whilst some studies included patients of all ages, these had low numbers of children and
wide age brackets. The paucity of evidence regarding children likely reflects a reduced need
for hospitalisation due to lower clinical severity of covid-19, but also indicates a need for
more paediatric studies. It is important to investigate the full range of potential clinical
presentations in children, especially given increasing case reports of severe multisystem
inflammatory conditions in children[73]. Nearly 80% of included studies and more than onethird of patients were from China, and ethnicity was not reported in these studies. As
increasing evidence emerges regarding the complex relationship between ethnicities and
other risk factors for covid-19 severity[74, 75], this relationship will be important to elicit in
future studies in different settings.
The studies in this review collected data on patients admitted to hospital in the early months
of the pandemic, when awareness of non-respiratory symptoms was lower and therefore
may not have been recognised or documented by healthcare providers or researchers.
Anosmia and dysgeusia have been reported increasingly[76] and has been included in
several countries’ covid-19 case definition[77-79]. Coagulation abnormalities were not
frequently reported in these studies. However, there is increasing evidence regarding the
higher risk of thrombosis in covid-19 patients suggesting that monitoring of coagulopathy
and use of anti-thrombotic medication may be an important aspect of treatment[80, 81]. Use
of anticoagulants was reported in only one study[65]. Other manifestations emerging from
recent literature include neurological[4] and cardiovascular[3] disease. Although biochemical
parameters from early studies in China indicated multiorgan manifestations, these outcomes
were not frequently reported in the included studies[50]. The long term outcomes of covid-19
are still unknown, however patients with severe disease may have significant complications.
As our understanding of the type and frequency of covid-19 symptoms evolves, this should

be reflected in updated patient data collection protocols to ensure emerging symptoms are
documented[82].
The use of corticosteroids varied widely in the included studies with administration of
different dose, duration and target populations, and respiratory support status was not
provided for these patients. Although most of studies from early in the pandemic
recommended against the use of corticosteroids, recent evidence from the RECOVERY
RCT demonstrates a reduction in mortality with use of low dose dexamethasone in patients
requiring respiratory support. This highlights the importance of integrating evidence from
RCTs into clinical management and national health authority guidelines during a pandemic.
As the covid-19 pandemic has progressed across geographical boundaries and populations,
there is increasing data available from other countries and specifically from LMICs. Our
review included studies published before the 28th April, and we found no studies reporting
patient cohorts from LMICs despite both Egypt and Brazil reporting initial covid-19 cases in
February 2020. This may be due to under-recognition or underreporting of cases in these
countries earlier on in the pandemic.
There were limitations to this review, we focused on hospitalised patients due to limited data
being available from primary care settings. We only included studies with at least 100
patients to ensure robustness. Hospitalised patients are likely to represent the more severe
end of the clinical spectrum, presenting with a more advanced clinical picture compared to
cases in the community. As reports emerge of the elderly with severe disease being cared
for in care homes, this population may be under-represented in our data. New symptoms
that have recently become significant may not have been documented consistently, and the
data biased by different countries’ admission policies. Furthermore, evaluating the
progression of clinical characteristics was challenging as many studies did not report on the
day of illness on which results were recorded.

This review reflects our knowledge of covid-19 in the earlier months of the pandemic.
Awareness of presentation with non-respiratory symptoms has increased over time, which
has significant implications for the identification of cases and prevention of nosocomial and
care home transmission. These factors are likely important amplifiers of local outbreaks and
disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. These data highlight the urgent need for
studies to include different at risk populations and emphasise the importance of clinical
characterisation studies which facilitate robust and comparable data collection.
