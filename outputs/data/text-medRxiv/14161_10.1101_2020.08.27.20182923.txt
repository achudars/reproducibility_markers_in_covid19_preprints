Abstract

18

Background and objectives: Several antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2

19

specific antibodies, many of which address different antigens. Rapid point-of-care (POC) tests

20

have been doubted due to an eventual risk of production errors, although it is unstudied

21

whether such error would affect test sensitivity and/or specificity. We aimed to evaluate two

22

separate production lots of a commercially available test intended for rapid detection of IgM

23

and IgG against the N-terminal part of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1).

24

Materials and methods: Serum samples from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2

25

infection, by RT-PCR and/or serology, and pre-COVID-19 negative control sera gathered

26

from a biobank during 2018 were collected. The presence of anti-S1 IgM/IgG was verified by

27

an in-house Luminex-based serological assay, serving as reference method. The index test

28

was a commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette

29

[Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China/Healgen Scientific, LLC,

30

U.S.A.]).

31

Results: One hundred samples were verified positive for anti-S1 IgG (median fluorescence

32

intensity (MFI) ≥900) and 74 for anti-S1 IgM (MFI ≥700), confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90)

33

and/or serology (n=89). None of the negative controls (n=200; MFI <300) had SARS-CoV-2

34

anti-S1 IgM, while one tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG. For the two lots, the

35

sensitivities of the rapid test were 93.2% (69/74; 95% CI: 85.1% – 97.1%) and 87.8% (65/74;

36

95% CI: 78.5% – 93.5%) for IgM, respectively 93.0% (93/100; 95% CI: 86.3% – 96.6%) and

37

100.0% for IgG (100/100; 95% CI: 96.3% – 100.0%). The specificity for both lots was 100%

38

for IgM (200/200; 95% CI: 98.1% – 100%) and 99.5% for IgG (199/200; 95% CI: 97.2% –

39

99.9%). The positive predictive value was 100% for IgM and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The

40

negative predictive value was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0% for IgG.

41

Conclusion: The rapid POC-test used in this study is suitable to assess SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1

42

specific IgM/IgG, as a measure of previous virus exposure on an individual level. While the

43

specificity was not affected by production lot, external validation of separate lots of rapid

44

POC-tests is encouraged to ensure high sensitivity before market introduction.

Background

47

In late 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory disease was reported from

48

Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Within months, the disease COVID-19, caused by the novel

49

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread to cause a global

50

pandemic, infecting over 23 million individuals worldwide, as of August 25.1 Diagnostic

51

accuracy is vital, as the disease can resemble other viruses and bacteria and cause a wide

52

range of symptoms; from asymptomatic infections, to those of a mild common cold or more

53

severe symptoms such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi organ failure.2, 3 The

54

virus is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the Coronavirus family. These viruses

55

share structural similarities and are composed of 16 non-structural proteins and four structural

56

proteins: the spike (S), envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In turn, the N-

57

terminal part of the S protein (S1) contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically

58

recognizes the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in humans, which SARS-

59

CoV-2 has been identified to bind to in order to infect the human host.4-6

60

There is convincing evidence that a majority of patients with past COVID-19

61

develop neutralizing antibodies against the virus.7 For detection of antibodies, there are

62

several available serological assays developed to identify individuals with recent and past

63

exposure and to assess the extent of exposure in a population. In turn, this might help to

64

decide on application, enforcement or relaxation of containment measures. As proper

65

neutralization tests are cumbersome, time-consuming and require biosafety level 3

66

laboratories, there are several available tests that address different SARS-CoV-2 specific

67

antigens, the most common being the N-protein or the S-protein.

68

In a recent population-based study from Spain, different seroprevalences were

69

estimated by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) for detection of anti-N

70

IgG, and a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA) for detection of anti-S1 IgG.3

71

Whether the difference in estimated seroprevalence could be explained by dynamic

72

appearance of antibodies targeting the different viral proteins or whether the rapid point-of-

73

care (POC) test did not have as good performance as the CMIA-test, is unknown.

74

Available serological methods to date either rely on quantitative laboratory-

75

based assays or on qualitative LFIAs. While the lateral flow tests have the advantage of being

76

a POC-analysis where results can be given directly to the patient within minutes from sample

77

collection, rapid POC-tests have been attributed a potential risk of production errors that may

78

result in unreliable performance of the test. There is, however, to our knowledge no study

79

published to date investigating whether the sensitivity and/or specificity varies between

production lots of a rapid test. In this study, we therefore aimed to evaluate two separate

81

production lots of one commercially available rapid POC-test (the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid

82

Test Cassette [Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou, Zhejiang, China]) and its

83

accuracy in identifying anti-S1 IgM/IgG. As reference standard, presence of SARS-CoV-2

84

S1-specific IgM and IgG in positive controls were verified with an in-house Luminex-based

85

COVID-19 assay (Magpix technology, Luminex Corporation).

86
87
88

Material and methods

89

Serum samples

90

Positive controls constituted of serum from Swedish COVID-19 patients or convalescents,

91

confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-

92

PCR) and/or serology for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG, between March to July 2020.

93

Negative controls constituted of serum from babies (6-12 months old) and randomly selected

94

blood donor sera from the Uppsala Academic Hospital from individuals, without any known

95

history of SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 and before the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e.

96

collected 2018). Clinical samples that had been deposited in Uppsala Biobank were

97

anonymized and used in accordance with local ethical guidelines. They were all used with

98

informed consent according to the Swedish Biobank law, which allows anonymized

99

diagnostic patient samples to be used for purposes similar to those of the original sampling.

100

The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (2020–02047).

101
102

Reference method

103

Samples were pre-specified when evaluating the index test. The reference method used was a

104

Luminex-based (Magpix technology, Luminex Corporation) SARS-CoV-2-specific assay,

105

developed in-house and used due to high specificity and sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2

106

S1-specific IgM and IgG (manuscript in preparation). Samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2

107

infection that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG with a median fluorescence

108

intensity (MFI) ≥900 were used as reference for positive IgG-samples. Of those, samples

109

positive for SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgM with an MFI ≥700 served as reference for positive

110

IgM-samples. Samples with an MFI <300 were considered negative for anti-S1 IgM and IgG.

111

All samples were from unique individuals and analysed anonymously.

114

Index test

115

The index test (rapid POC-test) used was run according to the manufacturer´s instructions

116

(COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; Product/Model: GCCOV-402a, Lot no. 2003287

117

[Lot A] and Lot no. 2004156 [Lot B]; Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co Ltd, Huzhou,

118

Zhejiang, China / Healgen Scientific LLC, Houston, USA). This test targets anti-S1 IgM and

119

IgG. Briefly, 5 µl of serum were added to the test slide, followed by 80 µl of the buffer

120

provided in the kit. The results were read after 10 minutes (max 15 min) by the naked eye.

121

Test results were blinded to the assessors of the index test, as well as to the assessors of the

122

reference standard.

123
124

Analysis

125

Only index tests in which the control line changed colour were regarded as valid (no test was

126

excluded from analysis). If a line was observed for IgM and/or IgG, the test was considered

127

positive. The intensity of the colour was not judged. Sample sizes were determined in order to

128

comply with the recommendations from the Swedish Public Health Agency for validation of

129

COVID-19 related serological assays. The sensitivity of the index test was calculated as the

130

proportion of index positives among reference positives, and specificity as the proportion of

131

index negatives among reference negatives. The Wilson Score method was used to calculate

132

95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Analyses were performed with STATA v13.1 (StataCorp,

133

Texas, USA). Plots for positive and negative predictive value (PPV; NPV) as a function of

134

prevalence were created in R v4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020). Reporting of results are made

135

according to the 2015 Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement.8

Results

139

Selected serum samples

140

One hundred serum samples, confirmed by RT-PCR (n=90) and/or by serology (n=89), had

141

an MFI ≥900 (range: 998 – 6,477) for anti-S1 IgG. Of those, 74 had an MFI ≥700 (range: 738

142

– 5,916) for anti-S1 IgM. None of the 200 samples from 2018 gathered from the biobank

143

tested positive for anti-S1 IgM and IgG (MFI <300). A flow diagram of sampling is depicted

144

in Figure 1.

148

Index test

149

With the index test, none of the 200 negative sera from blood donors and babies tested IgM

150

positive (0/200, 0% [95% CI: 0.0-1.9%]), while one tested IgG positive (1/200, 0.5 %, [95%

151

CI: 0.1-2.8%]). This was the case in both production lots tested (Tables 1 and 2). The single

152

IgG-positive sample was re-analysed and remained IgG positive in the second test in both

153

lots. Of the 74 IgM-positive samples, five tested IgM negative (6.8% [95% CI: 2.9-14.9%]) in

154

Lot A and nine (12.2% [95% CI: 6.5-21.5%]) in Lot B. Of the 100 IgG-positive samples,

155

seven tested IgG negative (7.0% [95% CI: 3.4-13.7%]) in Lot A while none tested IgG

156

negative in Lot B (0% [95% CI: 0.0% to 3.7%]). The MFI of the false IgG negatives in Lot A

157

ranged between 998 - 3,453. The MFI of the false IgM negatives ranged 761 - 1,340 and 738 -

158

1,641 for Lot A and B, respectively.

159
160

Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values

161

Based on the results described above and summarized in Tables 1 and 2, the index test had a

162

sensitivity of 87.8% and 93.2% for IgM and 93.0% and 100.0% for IgG (Table 3). The test

163

exhibited an overall specificity of 100.0% for IgM and 99.5% for IgG. The PPV (probability

164

of have been infected and having antibodies given a positive test result) was 100% for IgM

165

and 98.9% and 99.0% for IgG. The NPV (probability of not yet been infected and not having

166

antibodies given a negative test result) was 95.7% and 97.6% for IgM, and 96.6% and 100.0%

167

for IgG. For both antibody types, PPV and NPV remained high over a broad range of

168

prevalence (Figure 2).

Discussion

172

In this study, we evaluated different production lots of a commercially available rapid POC-

173

test for detection of IgM and IgG against the S1-protein of SARS-CoV-2. The test displayed a

174

high sensitivity and specificity when compared against a Luminex-based (Magpix

175

technology) SARS-CoV-2-specific assay. Comparing two different production lots, the

176

sensitivity was 87.8% and 93.2% for IgM and 93.0% and 100.0% for IgG. Regarding the

177

specificity, it remained at 100.0% and 99.5% for IgM and IgG, respectively. A high

178

performance of the rapid test has also been reported elsewhere, with a specificity ranging

179

from 97.5% to 100% for IgG and 100% for IgM, and a sensitivity ranging from 96.7% to 98%

180

for IgG and 68% to 100% for IgM.10 The Swedish Public Health Agency has warranted a IgG

181

specificity of ≥99.5% and a sensitivity of ≥90% for COVID-19 related serological assays to

182

be recommended as an assay for assessment of antibody presence on an individual level.11 In

183

this study, both investigated production lots of the investigated POC-test reached that

184

standard and may, thus, be suitable for antibody screening in Sweden.

185

Differences in sensitivity of the two production lots in the current study might

186

be explained by small differences in the amount of antigen added during production of the

187

rapid test, which could lead to a weaker qualitative response and, thus, effecting the

188

sensitivity of the test. Different amounts, and not varying quality, of the antigen would also

189

explain why the test was still highly specific in both lots. Previously, we have reported a

190

sensitivity of 69% (20/29) and 93% (27/29) for IgM and IgG respectively for the same rapid

191

POC-test.12 In that study, positive controls constituted of serum from PCR-confirmed

192

COVID-19 patients or convalescents with unknown serological response.12 Thus, some of the

193

samples serving as positive controls could have been collected in the seronegative window or

194

lost the antibodies, explaining the higher sensitivity observed in the current study.

195

In a recent population-based study from Spain; more than 51,000 individuals

196

were tested by a CMIA for detection of anti-N IgG and the same rapid POC-test as

197

investigated in the current study, which targets anti-S1 IgM/IgG.3 Comparing the two tests,

198

the authors observed different seroprevalences of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. Given the high

199

performance in detection of anti-S1 IgM and IgG observed in the current study, a possible

200

explanation for the discrepancy could be that the median seroconversion time, and the

201

antibody peak time, have been observed to occur later for anti-S1 IgM/IgG, as compared to

202

anti-N IgM/IgG.13,14 Moreover, anti-S1 IgG levels have been observed to be four times higher

203

during convalescence than in the acute phase in about 40% of patients,14 while measurement

204

of only anti-N IgM/IgG have been observed to substantially underestimate the proportion of

205

SARS-CoV-2 infections in general.15 Thus, an inter-individual heterogeneity in antigens to

206

which different patients develop antibodies against, or the heterogenous dynamics of antibody

207

appearance, could be a possible explanation to the cumbersome process of inventing a single

208

test that can identify past exposure to the virus with as close to 100% accuracy as possible,

209

despite the worlds weighted efforts. As the current study only aimed to evaluate the

210

performance of the rapid POC-test in detecting anti-S1 IgM/IgG, the non-population-based

211

and predefined study design inherits a weakness in the sense that the POC-test investigated

212

does not detect individuals with antibodies against the N- or other parts of the S-protein. Due

213

to the inter-individual differences in dynamics of these antibody subtypes, it has been

214

suggested that a combination of antibody tests, targeting different viral proteins, may be the

215

best strategy in order to increase sensitivity and/or specificity when screening for SARS-CoV7

216

2 specific antibodies.3 However, as anti-S antibodies can block the ACE2-receptor and thus

217

prevent SARS-CoV-2 from infecting the human host,13 a positive result from the studied rapid

218

POC-test could indicate immunity against re-infection as long as adequate titers are upheld.

219

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of

220

production lots on the performance of a rapid POC-test intended for detection of SARS-CoV-

221

2 specific anti-S1 IgM and IgG. The world is looking for serological assays that can help to

222

decide on relaxation of containment measures and POC-tests are optimal for such purpose

223

given the lower associated costs, easier implementation, and the potentially increased uptake

224

as compared with laboratory-based assays. The fact that the PPV and NPV for IgG remained

225

high over a broad range of prevalence indicates that the investigated rapid POC-test is suitable

226

for screening of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in regions with varying prevalence and

227

during different stages of the pandemic, and therefore could aid in determining containment

228

measures. The observed differences in sensitivity between the two production lots highlight

229

the need for external validation of each production lot before a rapid POC-test is made

230

available on the market.
