ABSTRACT
Objectives: The purpose is to analyze the potential association of each antibiotic
consumption rate and use ratio with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and to
investigate the efficacy and safe use of antibiotics against COVID-19.
Design: Retrospective statistical analysis study of antibiotic use compared with COVID19 morbidity and mortality.
Methods: Each antibiotic defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day as each
antibiotic consumption rate was available in the official reports and each antibacterial use
ratio data was calculated from them. Coronavirus Disease data were obtained from the
WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard. The relationships between the sum of DDD, each
antibacterial DDD, each antibiotic use ratio, and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality were
examined. The statistical correlation was calculated by univariate linear regression
analysis and expressed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Results: The sum of DDD had no statistical correlation with mortality and morbidity.
Cephalosporins were a negative correlation with them. Penicillins had a weak positive
correlation with them. Macrolides, quinolones, and sulfonates showed a slightly negative
correlation tendency with mortality.
Conclusions: Cephalosporins may affect less COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.
Penicillins suggest to accelerate them. The combination of cephalosporins with
macrolides or quinolones may be a helpful treatment. The difference in antibiotic use
between Japan and EU/EEA countries will suggest an explanation for the reduction in
morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization (WHO) is very clear that antibiotics do not work against
viruses but only bacteria, and yet health care providers are using antibiotics in some
patients with COVID-19. Patients with viral pneumonia can develop a secondary bacterial
infection that may need to be treated with antibiotics, although, this complication is
reported to be uncommon early on in the course of COVID-19 pneumonia (1).
On the other hand, some antibiotics have demonstrated several antiviral activities.
Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is being investigated as a potential treatment
for people with COVID-19 (2,3,4,5). Clarithromycin suppresses virus growth (5,6). In in
vitro laboratory studies, quinolones have demonstrated antiviral activity against human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). And their antiviral activity is identified by inhibition of
viral RNA production in a dose-dependent manner (7,8). They also can be considered
excellent candidates for the development of anti-Zika virus and anti-chikungunya virus
(CHIKV) agents (9). It seems that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suppress human
immunodeficiency viral load and provide an excellent clinical response to antiretroviral

therapy for HIV (10). Sulfonates can act on Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi
sarcoma herpesvirus (11). Antibiotics have been already used for the treatment of
community-acquired pneumonia caused by designated, susceptible bacteria, and for the
treatment of other bacterial infections in daily practice. Cephalosporins that is more than
60% of them are third-generation, macrolides, and quinolones are frequently used in
Japan, and penicillins are frequently used in EU/EEA countries (12,13). The antibiotic
use trend is across in East Asia. The morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 in
Japan and East Asia are less than in EU/EEA countries. Health care providers daily use
several antibiotics to treat microbiological infectious patients under COVID-19 status.
There are also differences between EU/EEA countries and Japan in how antibiotics are
used. Therefore, it may be imagined that each antibiotic daily consumption rate and use
ratio may influence COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. If they are associated with
morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19, antibiotics will be suggested to influence
COVID-19. Little is known about the potential protective and promotive factors from
antibiotics against COVID-19. It is necessary to investigate the protective factors of antiinfective agents that may protect against infection and the factors that improve or promote
the outcome if physicians use antibiotics under the condition of COVID-19 epidemic.
Therefore, the relationship between each daily antibiotic use and COVID-19 morbidity
and mortality should be studied.
This retrospective study aims to determine whether each antibiotic consumption rate and
use ratio may have the potential affecting morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19
and to investigate the effective and safe use of antibiotics against COVID-19.
METHODS
Study design
The retrospective statistical analysis study of antibiotic use compared with COVID-19
morbidity and mortality.
Setting and samples
This single-center study was obtained by the institutional ethics review board, and this
study was the retrospective cohort study using public data. Data were collected for
antibiotic consumption rate and use ratio, and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

Procedure
The antibiotic consumption data from the annual epidemiological report for 2019 that
contained the consumption of antibacterials for systemic use by EU/EEA countries in
2018 expressed as DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day was used (12). Japan data was
obtained from the antimicrobial selling data in 2019 (13). That is, these data represented
each antibiotic consumption rate. Each antibacterial use ratio was calculated from these
data. COVID-19 morbidity per 0.1 M population and mortality caused by this disease per
0.1 M population in each of the countries were obtained from the WHO coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) Dashboard on 25 May 2020. Table 1 showed the population,
morbidity per 0.1 M population, mortality per 0.1 M population, the sum of consumption
as DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, and each antibiotic consumption as DDD per 1000
inhabitants per day (tetracyclines: J01A, macrolides: J01F, cephalosporins: J01D,
penicillins: J01C, quinolones: J01M, and sulfonamides: J01E) by each of the countries.
Table 2 showed morbidity per 0.1 M population with each number, mortality per 0.1 M
population with each number, and each antibiotic use ratio by each of the countries.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using univariate linear regression analysis and
Pearson's correlation coefficient. A p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Data
were analyzed statistical software available through Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft
Corporation Redmond, Washington). We analyzed two kinds of relationships. One was
the relationship between each antibiotic DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day and COVID19 morbidity and mortality. The other was the relationship between each antibiotic use
ratio and them. These analyses were examined by tetracyclines (J01A), macrolides (J01F),
cephalosporins (J01D), penicillins (J01C), quinolones (J01M), and sulfonates (J01E).
RESULTS
Morbidity per 0.1 M population was 199.39±175.39 (n=31) and mortality per 0.1 M
population was 16.83±22.65 (n=31).
The results of the two analyses were calculated by univariate linear regression analysis
and expressed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The regression line represented as Y:
morbidity or mortality, and X: antibacterial consumption rate or use ratio.
The statistical analysis between antibacterial consumption rate and COVID-19
morbidity and mortality
1. Defined Daily Dose (DDD): The sum was a mean±SD: 17.84±5.98.
The sum of DDD had no relationship with morbidity (Y = 1.64X+161.92; r = 0.05;
significance: NS; p = 0.77) and mortality (Y = 0.27X+11.34; r = 0.07; significance: NS;
p = 0.69).
2. Macrolides (J01F): The consumption rate was a mean±SD: 2.92±1.42.
There was no relationship with morbidity (Y = -16.03X+246.25; r = -0.13; significance:
NS; p = 0.49) and with mortality (Y = -0.36X+11.41; r = -0.02; significance: NS; p =
0.90).
3. Cephalosporins (J01D): The consumption rate was a mean±SD: 2.23±1.94.
A negative correlation with morbidity (Y = -38.43X+285.18; r=-0.43; significance: p <
0.05; p = 0.02) and mortality (Y = -3.89X+24.89; r = -0.50; significance: p<0.01;
= 0.004) was seen.

DISCUSSION
Principle findings
The antibiotic consumption dose for systemic use by EU/EEA countries in 2018 was
expressed as DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day. Therefore, the relationship between each
DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality represented
whether each antibiotic consumption rate is related to COVID-19. The relationship
between the antibiotic use ratio and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality indicated
whether the antibiotic use trend affects COVID-19. The sum of DDD suggests no affect
morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19. However, each antibiotic analysis
represents various analytical results. Cephalosporins suggest decreasing morbidity and
mortality caused by COVID-19. Penicillins may have the potential to accelerate them.
Quinolones suggest the potential to reduce morbidity, and the weak potential against
mortality. Macrolides may have the potential for reducing morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, macrolides and quinolones may suggest working against COVID-19.
Sulfonates and trimethoprim have almost the same mortality affect as quinolones.
However, they may suggest increasing morbidity. Tetracyclines may increase morbidity,
but may not affect mortality. The results of these analyses were similar to those of
EU/EEA countries alone. Therefore, cephalosporins, macrolides, and quinolones may be
potentially effective against COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). And, sulfonates and

trimethoprim may have the potential reducing mortality.
Cephalosporins, macrolides, and quinolones are frequently used in Japan, but penicillins
are frequently used in European countries (12,13). The different antibiotic use trends may
suggest an explanation for less morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 in Japan
rather than in EU/EEA countries. The antibiotic use trend in Japan is across East Asia.
Although the analytical data is from 2018 and is not the latest, the antibiotic consumption
rate and use trend from the previous report are not so different. Therefore, the results of
this study will appear to fit in with the latest.
Penicillins
The results imply that it is prudent to avoid penicillins use in the current status of the
COVID-19 epidemic, as penicillins may suggest increasing morbidity and mortality
caused by COVID-19. Penicillins may appear to create an environment for COVID-19
proliferation or may help the virus spread rapidly through cells.
Macrolides
Macrolides have been shown to be active in vitro against RNA viruses. Azithromycin is
thought to have antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity and may work synergistically
with other antiviral treatments. Azithromycin has demonstrated antiviral activity against
Zika virus and against rhinoviruses from in vitro studies. Azithromycin is a macrolide
antibiotic that is being investigated as a potential treatment for people with COVID-19
caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (2,3,4,5). Clarithromycin decreases
interferon (IFN)-γ and increases IL-10 levels. Clarithromycin promotes the expansion of
immunosuppressive CD11b+Gr-1+ cells essential for the immunomodulatory properties
of macrolides (6). Clarithromycin suppresses virus growth (5,6). Ivermectin is a cyclic
lactone oral anthelmintic that belongs to the macrolides group. Ivermectin is anti-parasitic
previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro, and it is an inhibitor
of SARS-CoV-2 (14). Indeed, it seems that the mortality rate caused by COVID-19 is low
in Onchocerciasis endemic areas of Africa (1). However, from an action point of view,
these drugs seem to be effective only in the early stages.
Quinolones
Quinolone derivatives have been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
replication at the transcriptional level (7). Richter et al. reported that introducing an aryl

group into the piperazine moiety of fluoroquinolone changed its activity from
antibacterial to antiviral, with specific effects on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
(8). Antiviral activity is confirmed by dose-dependently inhibiting viral RNA production
(9).
Sulfonates and trimethoprim
Sulfonates and trimethoprim show almost the same mortality effect as quinolones. So,
they may work against COVID-19 mortality. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole appears to
be effective in suppressing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) load and antiretroviral
therapy (10). It has antimalarial and antibacterial properties. Since trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole is used in the current state of COVID-19, its function against RNA
viruses may be due to its antimalarial properties. Because, in principle, antibacterial
agents do not act on viruses. Sulfonates can also act on herpesvirus such as EBV and
Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus belonging to DNA virus (11). Hence, antimalarial properties
may act on RNA and DNA viruses.
Cephalosporins
Strangely, in this study, the higher cephalosporins consumption rate and use ratio will
make lower morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 than other antibacterials.
Cephalosporins have not been proven effective against viruses. β-lactam antibiotics
including cephalosporins have a bacteriostatic effect. The bacteriostatic action means the
action of suppressing the growth of bacteria. β-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting
peptidoglycan synthase, which is an enzyme required for synthesizing bacterial cell walls.
However, cephalosporins suggest inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.
There are four effective cases of cephalosporins (Ceftriaxone) combination therapy with
minocycline (broad-spectrum tetracycline) in Japan (15). Tetracyclines do not affect
mortality caused by COVID-19 from this study. Therefore, the results of this study and
these effective cases imply that cephalosporins may work against SARS-CoV-2.
Based on empiric treatment for patients with MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
According to the previous report (16) for patients with MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
that is the same coronavirus of SARS-CoV-2, empirical treatment with neuraminidase
inhibitors and an association of antibiotics effective against S. pneumoniae and L.
pneumophila are the key management of hospitalized patients. Third-generation

cephalosporins are effective against S. pneumoniae, and macrolides and quinolones are
effective against L. pneumophila. Macrolides (azithromycin or clarithromycin) or
quinolones (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are the standard treatment for Legionella
pneumonia in humans, with levofloxacin being considered first-line with increasing
resistance to azithromycin. The results of this study show the similarities in the use of
antibiotic agents in the conclusions of the previous report (16). The antibiotic combination
of cephalosporins with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) may also be an effective
therapy from the perspective of reducing COVID-19 mortality.
Implications for practice
When a physician needs to treat several secondary bacterial infections that two different
antibiotic combinations are often used, the combination therapy with cephalosporins and
quinolones or macrolides may be an effective treatment under the condition of COVID19 epidemic period. In general, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines for SARSCoV-2. All of the drug treatment options come from experience treating SARS, MERS,
or some other new influenza virus previously. Active symptomatic support continues to
be the key to treatment. This retrospective study suggests that the treatment regimen
proposed by Bleibtreu et al. (16) may be effective for COVID-19. However, the efficacy
of this regimen needs to be further confirmed.
Conclusions
The results of this study imply that penicillins should be avoided to use under the
condition in COVID-19. Empirical treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and the
combination of cephalosporins and macrolides or quinolones are suggested to be an
effective treatment for COVID-19.
