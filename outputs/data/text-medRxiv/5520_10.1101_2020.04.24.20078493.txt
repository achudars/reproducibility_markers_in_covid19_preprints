Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United
States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model

Received: date / Accepted: date

Abstract In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR
model is proposed, denoted by SEIQRP model, which has
a basic guiding significance for the prediction of the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other
insect diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R0 is derived. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When
R0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local
asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium
points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States
is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified
SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model.
According to the real data of the United States, it is found
that our improved model has a better prediction ability for
the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases are predicted. The
modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important
reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.

1 Introduction
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in
2019 occurred in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. This
is a severe respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin [1]. The Chinese government has
implemented many measures, including the establishment of
specialized hospitals and restrictions on travel, to reduce the
spread. By April 20, 2020, the outbreak in China has been
basically controlled. However, the outbreak is still rampant
all over the world. At present, the United States, Italy, Spain and other countries are still in the rising stage of the
outbreak. It has posed a great threat to the public health and
safety of the world.
At present, many countries have adopted mitigation measures to restrict travel and public gatherings, which have a
serious impact on the economy. Therefore, it is very important to predict the development trend of this epidemic and
estimate the peak of the isolated cases. The epidemic model
is a basic tool to research the dynamic behaviours of disease
and predict the spreading trend of disease. Establishing a
reasonable epidemic model can effectively characterize the
development process of the disease. Therefore, a generalized SEIR epidemic model is proposed in this paper, and is
defined as SEIQRP model. Some qualitative properties of
this model are first analyzed, including the existence and uniqueness of the disease-free and the endemic equilibrium
points. Then, conditions are also established to ensure the
local asymptotic stability of both disease-free and endemic
equilibrium points.
So far, many scholars have researched COVID-19 from
different perspectives [1–5, 23]. In [6], the epidemics trend
of COVID-19 in China was predicted under public health interventions. In [7], the basic reproduction number of COVID19 in China was estimated and the data-driven analysis was
performed in the early phase of the outbreak. In order to pre-

dict the cumulative number of confirmed cases and combine
the actual measures taken by the government on the outbreak
of COVID-19, we further put forward an improved SEIQRP model, denoted by SEIQRPD model. At present, we can
obtain the epidemic data of COVID-19 outbreak in the United States before April 20, 2020. We use these data and
the improved model to predict the epidemic trend of the United States in the next two weeks, and estimate the peak of
isolated cases. Firstly, the data before April 5 was selected
to identify the model parameters, and the prediction ability
of the improved model with the epidemiological data from
April 6 to April 20 is verified. Then, the cumulative number
of confirmed cases and isolated cases are predicted in the
next two weeks. The peak of isolated cases is thus predicted.
In recent years, with the continuous development of fractional calculus theory, fractional order systems modeling approaches have been applied in various engineering and nonengineering fields [19–21]. Compared with the short memory of the integer derivative, the fractional derivative has the
information of the whole time interval or long memory. It is
more accurate to describe the biological behavior of population by using fractional differential equation.
The rest of this manuscript is structured as below. In
Section 2, the fractional SEIQRP model and the modified
SEIQRP model is proposed. Some qualitative properties of
the SEIQRP model are discussed in Section 3. In Section
4, the prediction ability of the modified SEIQRP model is
verified by using real data. The disease development in the
United States in the next two weeks after April 21, 2020
is predicted. Finally, conclusion and some future works are
discussed in Section 5.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has had a great impact on
the economic growth of any country and daily life of any
human. In order to control and prevent the possible outbreak
of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 or other insect diseases in the future, it is very important to establish an appropriate model. The transmission diagram of the generalized
SEIR model proposed in this paper is shown in Figure 1. We
divide the total population into six distinct epidemic classes:
susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, recovered and
insusceptible. We will represent the number of individuals at
time t in the above classes by S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t) and
P(t), respectively. The specific explanations of the above six
categories are as follows:
• Susceptible S(t): the number of uninfected individuals
at the time t.

Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model

• Exposed E(t): the number of infected individuals at the
time t but still in incubation period (without clinical symptoms and low infectivity).
• Infectious I(t): the number of infected individuals at the
time t (with obvious clinical symptoms).
• Quarantined Q(t): the number of individuals who have
been diagnosed and isolated at the time t.
• Recovered R(t): the number of recovered individuals at
the time t.
• Insusceptible P(t): the number of susceptible individuals
who are not exposed to the external environment at the
time t.
The incidence rate plays a very important role in the epidemic, which can describe the evolution of infectious disease. According to the spread of different diseases in different regions, there are many forms of incidence rate. [10–
12]. We expect to establish a generalized incidence rate,
which can contain most of these specific forms. Therefore,
the SEIQRP model with general incidence rate is given by

2.3 Modified SEIQRP model
In the following, we will combine the actual situation
and government mitigation policy to improve the SEIQRP
model (2). Firstly, during the outbreak of COVID-19, we

3

need to make reasonable assumptions according to the actual
mitigation policies and circumstances.
• During the COVID-19 outbreak, population mobility is
strictly controlled by many countries. Especially, the policy of city closure was implemented in Hubei province,
China. Therefore, the impact of migration will not be
considered in the improved model.
• For the prediction of this short-term virus transmission,
the impact of natural mortality will not be considered.
It is assumed that novel coronavirus is the only cause of
death during the outbreak.
• In order to predict the trend of cumulative confirmed cases, it is necessary to simulate the number of death cases.
Therefore, a new class D(t) to the SEIQRP model will
be added in the modified model, which denotes the number of death cases at time t.
• The time-varying cure rate, mortality rate and infection
rate will be applied to the improved model. This can better simulate the impact of the improvement of medical
conditions and government control on individuals in reality.
Based on the above assumptions and analysis, the following
improved model for COVID-19 is proposed.

κ2 are all positive, where σ is used to simulate the intensity of government control. It should be emphasized that the
protection rate ρ for susceptible individuals also reflects the
intensity of government control.
3 Qualitative Analysis of the SEIQRP Model
3.1 The Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibrium Point
Obviously, the right side of system (2) satisfies the local
Lipschitz condition, then there exists a unique solution of
system (2) [8, 15].
Theorem 1 The solutions of system (2) are non-negative,
and the closed set Ω = {(S, E, I, Q, R, P) ∈ R6+ : 0 ≤ S + E +
I + Q + R + D ≤ Λµ } is a positive invariant set of system (2).

Q10 = 0, R10 = 0 and P10 = 0. (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is the unique
solution of the above system. According to the fractionalorder comparison theorem [17], one can deduce that the solutions of system (2) satisfy S(t) ≥ 0, E(t) ≥ 0, I(t) ≥ 0,
Q(t) ≥ 0, R(t) ≥ 0 and P(t) ≥ 0. By adding six equations of

Forecast analysis of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in the United States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model

By the hypothesis (iv), this implies ϕ 0 (E∗ ) < 0. If there is
another endemic equilibrium point M∗∗ , then ϕ 0 (E∗∗ ) ≥ 0
holds, which contradicts the previous discussion. Hence, system (2) has a unique endemic equilibrium point M∗ when
R0 > 1. Based on the above analysis, the following result
can be obtained.
Theorem 2 System (2) has a unique disease-free equilibrium point M0 , if R0 < 1. System (2) has a unique endemic
equilibrium point M∗ , if R0 > 1.
3.2 Stability Analysis
In this section, the local asymptotic stability of diseasefree equilibrium point M0 and endemic equilibrium point M∗
for system (2) is discussed.
Theorem 3 With regard to system (2), the disease-free equilibrium point M0 is locally asymptotic stability, if R < 1; the
disease-free equilibrium point M0 is unstable, if R > 1.
Proof The Jacobian matrix of the system (2) at the diseasefree equilibrium point M0 is

The corresponding characteristic equation is
H(s) =|sE − JM0 |
=(s + µ)2 (s + µ + ρ)(s + µ + λ + κ)H1 (s),

(11)

where
H1 (s) =s2 + (δ + 2µ + ε − β2 f2 (S0 )g02 (0))s
+ (µ + δ )(µ + ε) − β2 (µ + δ ) f2 (S0 )g02 (0)

(12)

− εβ1 f1 (S0 )g01 (0).
The characteristic equation H(s) = 0 has four obvious negative characteristic roots, which are denoted by s1 = s2 = −µ,
s3 = −µ − ρ and s4 = −µ − λ − κ, respectively. The discriminant of H1 (s) in quadratic form is
∆ =[δ + 2µ + ε − β2 f2 (S0 )g02 (0)]2 − 4[(µ + δ )(µ + ε)
− β2 (µ + δ ) f2 (S0 )g02 (0) − εβ1 f1 (S0 )g01 (0)]
=(δ − ε + β2 f2 (S0 )g02 (0))2 + 4εβ1 f1 (S0 )g01 (0)
>0.
This implies that the other two eigenvalues s5 and s6 of characteristic equation H(s) = 0 are real roots. Hence
s5 + s6 = −(δ + 2µ + ε − β2 f2 (S0 )g02 (0)),
s5 s6 = (µ + δ )(µ + ε)(1 − R0 ).
If R0 < 1, then one can obtain s5 + s6 < 0 and s5 s6 > 0,
which imply s5 < 0 and s6 < 0. If R0 > 1, one has s5 s6 < 0,
which imply s5 > 0 or s6 > 0. It follows from Lemma 1 that
the proof is completed.
Further, we will show the locally asymptotic stability of
the endemic equilibrium point M∗ of system (2). Similarly,
the corresponding Jacobian matrix of the system (2) at M∗ is

(i) If D1 (L1 (s)) > 0, a1 > 0, a3 > 0 and a1 a2 > a3 , then the
endemic equilibrium point M∗ is locally asymptotically stable.
(ii) If D1 (L1 (s)) < 0, a1 > 0, a2 > 0 and a3 > 0, then the endemic equilibrium point M∗ is locally asymptotically stable
for α ∈ (0, 23 ).
(iii) If D1 (L1 (s)) < 0, a1 < 0 and a2 < 0, then the endemic
equilibrium point M∗ is unstable for α ∈ ( 23 , 1).
(iv) If D1 (L1 (s)) < 0, a1 > 0, a2 > 0 and a1 a2 = a3 , then
for α ∈ (0, 1), the endemic equilibrium point M∗ is locally
asymptotically stable.
Proof Based on the previous discussion, the characteristic
equation L(s) = 0 has three obvious negative roots s1 = s2 =
−µ and s3 = −µ −λ −κ. In order to investigate the stability
of equilibrium point M∗ , we only need to discuss the range
of the root of L1 (s) = 0, denoted by s4 , s5 and s6 .

The effectiveness of the model (15) in describing the spread
of COVID-19 is illustrated by selecting the confirmed, cured
and dead cases in the United States. According to the real
data provided by the Johns Hopkins University, the outbreak
in the United States has not been brought under full control.
The data of confirmed cases, cured cases and death cases are
selected from January 22, 2020, to April 20, 2020. Assuming that the confirmed individuals will be isolated, then
(16)

This hypothesis is in line with the actual situation. Hence,
we can obtain the real data of isolated cases. Through the
fractional predictor corrector method and the least squares
fitting [24], we can identify the parameters of the model (15)
through the real data, which can be found in Table 1.

cases rather than the cumulative number of confirmed cases. Under the parameters in Table 1, it can be calculated by
using (9) that R0 = 0.2041 < 1. By the conclusion in Theorem 3, the disease-free equilibrium point is local asymptotic
stable. The SEIQRP model has a basic guiding significance
for predicting and fitting spreading dynamics of COVID-19.
However, the prediction of this model for COVID-19 is relatively rough, we still need to improve model (15) according to actual mitigation policies and research objectives. According to the analysis in Section 2, we choose the SEIQRPD model to predict the trend of the epidemic in the United
States under reasonable assumptions.

2020, the outbreak in China has been basically controlled. In

many provinces of China, the number of new cases per day is
increasing in single digits. This means that the data in China
contains more information about the spreading dynamics of
COVID-19. Therefore, the data in Hubei, Guangdong, Hunan and Zhejiang are selected to research the fitting effect
of the model (17). According to the real data of these four
regions in China, the parameters of the model (17) are identified, and the results are shown in Table 2. The model (17)
successfully capture the trend of the outbreak, which can be

At present, we can obtain the epidemic data of the United States from January 22, 2020 to April 20, 2020. We
need to preprocess the data to remove the data smaller than
0.5% of the current highest number of confirmed cases. In
order to test the prediction ability of the SEIQRPD model (17) for the development process of the epidemic in the
United States, we select the data before April 5 to identify
the parameters of the SEIQRPD model (17). Furthermore,
in order to illustrate the ability of the SEIQRPD model (17)
in predicting the outbreak, we compared the real data and
fitted data after April 5, which can be seen in Table 3, Table
4 and Figure 4. According to the results in Table 3 and Table 4, it can be found that the real values of current isolated
cases and cumulative confirmed cases fall within the range
of 95% - 105% of the predicted values. This shows that the
SEIQRPD model (17) can effectively predict the data in the
next two weeks.

The isolated cases in the United States will peak on June
18, 2020, with the peak of 1.0431 × 106 , which can be seen
in Figure 5.

5 Conclusion
We first propose the fractional SEIQRP model with generalized incidence rates. Some qualitative properties of the
SEIQRP model are discussed. In order to predict COVID19 effectively, we propose an improved SEIQRPD model
according to the actual mitigation situation. According to
the data of the United States before April 5, 2020, the trend
of the outbreak in the United States from April 6 to April
20 is successfully predicted as compared to the real records.
Then, using the data before April 20, 2020, we forecast the
trend of the outbreak in the United States in the next two
weeks, and estimate the peak of isolated cases and the date
of the peak.
The improved SEIQRP model proposed in this paper
successfully captures the trend of COVID-19. The long-term
prediction needs to adjust the model appropriately according
to the change of policy and medical level. We will discuss in
the future work.
