Abstract

38

Fine scale delineation of epitopes recognized by the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2

39

infection will be critical to understanding disease heterogeneity and informing development of

40

safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics. The Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis (SERA)

41

platform leverages a high diversity random bacterial display library to identify epitope binding

42

specificities with single amino acid resolution. We applied SERA broadly, across human, viral

43

and viral strain proteomes in multiple cohorts with a wide range of outcomes from SARS-CoV-2

44

infection. We identify dominant epitope motifs and profiles which effectively classify COVID-19,

45

distinguish mild from severe disease, and relate to neutralization activity. We identify a

46

repertoire of epitopes shared by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses and

47

determine that a region of amino acid sequence identity shared by the SARS-CoV-2 furin

48

cleavage site and the host protein ENaC-alpha is a potential cross-reactive epitope. Finally, we

49

observe decreased epitope signal for mutant strains which points to reduced antibody response

50

to mutant SARS-CoV-2. Together, these findings indicate that SERA enables high resolution of

Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic has affected millions of people

56

world-wide and led to a major healthcare crisis. Considerable research has gone into

57

understanding the myriad symptoms that are seen in patients as well as the stark contrast

58

between the large number of mild or asymptomatic cases and the staggering death toll around

59

the world1–5. Determining the factors that contribute to different disease manifestations, severity

60

and immunity is critical to adequate therapeutic intervention, improved patient outcomes, and

61

vaccine design.

62

One avenue that is being extensively explored is the degree to which an immune

63

response to the virus protects, or harms, an individual. Although it is possible that a pre-existing

64

exposure to common coronaviruses may have a protective role during SARS-CoV-2 infection6,7,

65

it has also been proposed that antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may sometimes be directly

66

pathogenic or lead to the generation of auto-reactive antibodies8–12. With millions of cases

67

extant, and based on current trends, millions more in the coming months, it is critical that

68

patients be accurately assessed not just for infection but also for the potential of severe disease

69

progression, allowing timely application of treatments for best outcomes. Of considerable

70

concern as well is the specter of a combined SARS-CoV-2/influenza season with the need to

71

rapidly differentiate between multiple viral infections13,14. In addition, a growing number of

72

COVID-19 patients who had expected to fully recover have not, with symptoms that linger far

73

past the expected recovery period and cause significant disruption to their lives as well as an

74

extended need for healthcare. The number of “long-haulers” is not currently clear but the need

75

to elucidate the role of a disrupted immune system in their illness is pressing15–17.

76

Of paramount urgency is the development of a vaccine against SAR-CoV-2. Along with

77

the initial step of defining an effective vaccine for the immediate crisis, factors such as viral

78

mutation rate and the uncertainty of long-term immunity could play a large role in ongoing

79

management. It is unclear if it will be possible to develop “sterilizing immunity” to the virus, thus

80

preventing infection completely18–20. A yearly “flu-type” immunization would necessitate

81

continued surveillance of both viral evolution and patients’ yearly immune responses to keep

82

transmission and mortality to a minimum21.

83

Many different groups have examined antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, exploring

84

correlation with disease severity, duration of humoral response, and the neutralizing capacity of

85

response3,22,23. Most of these methods have been limited to quantitative assessment of humoral

86

response to whole proteins or large domains of spike and nucleoprotein. Peptide and phage

87

display libraries have also been used to capture higher resolution epitope patterns associated

88

with disease but are limited to characterization of linear epitope signal and in their ability to

89

make clinical seropositivity assessments4,24,25. We present in this paper the application of Serum

90

Epitope Repertoire Analysis (SERA), a high throughput, random bacterial peptide display

91

technology that enables assessment of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and high-resolution mapping

92

of epitopes across any arbitrary proteome, including wild-type SARS-CoV-2, its mutant strains,

93

common coronaviruses, and the human proteome.

94

We have leveraged over 2,000 pre-pandemic immune repertoires and over 500 COVID-

95

19 cases to identify the antigens and epitopes that elicit a SARS-CoV-2 humoral response. We

96

show that while antibody profiles of individuals are heterogeneous, epitope-level resolution

97

enables a range of analyses and visualizations, from the earliest epitopes to elicit an antibody

98

response, to putative mapping of structural epitopes that may be important for neutralization or

99

immunity. Combining epitope motifs into a panel yields a diagnostic classifier that distinguished

100

NAT+ cases from controls with accuracy comparable to serological tests in current use.

Differences in the quantity and quality of epitopes in mild versus moderate and severe disease

102

can be seen at sites of biological and clinical interest. In silico analysis of epitope repertoires on

103

wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 proteins suggests that some mutations may result in loss of

104

antibody reactivity to mutant SARS-CoV-2 infections while analysis against the human

105

proteome identified SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that may cross-react with human proteins and

106

contribute to disease pathogenesis. These capabilities are all possible through informatics

107

analysis of a single assay that requires a minimal amount of serum from each subject.

110

SERA screening of COVID-19 serum

111

We applied SERA to discover and validate SARS-CoV-2 antigens and epitopes across

112

the complete viral proteome from 779 COVID-19 serum samples taken from multiple cohorts of

113

individuals with recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infection, which in total include 579 unique subjects

114

(Table 1). We additionally leverage a large database of 1997 pre-pandemic controls. The

115

majority of the subjects were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive by nucleic acid testing (NAT). For

116

Cohorts I, II, and III, extensive characterization was available for covariates that included

117

disease severity, date of symptom onset, and in many cases, serological testing (Supplemental

118

Table 1).

119

Patient samples were all screened using the previously published SERA assay, which

120

enables high throughput characterization of antibody epitopes (Figure 1)26,27. In brief, serum or

121

plasma is incubated with the randomized bacterial display peptide library; antibodies bind to

122

peptides that mimic their natural epitopes and are then separated from unbound library

123

members using affinity-coupled magnetic beads. The resulting bacterial pools are grown

124

overnight, plasmids encoding the antibody-binding peptides are purified, and the peptide-

125

encoding regions are PCR amplified and barcoded with well-specific PCR indices. Ninety-four

126

samples are normalized, pooled together and sequenced via next-generation sequencing

127

(NGS). The output of SERA is a set of approximately 1 million peptide sequences for each

128

individual, representing their unique epitope repertoire. After SERA screening, we applied two

129

complementary discovery tools, IMUNE and PIWAS, to identify antigens and epitopes involved

130

in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response (Figure 1).

131
132
133

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteome antigens and epitopes
To establish an understanding of relevant SARS-CoV-2 antigens and epitopes, we

134

analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome with protein-based immunome wide association studies

135

(PIWAS). Briefly, PIWAS identifies epitope signal in the context of an arbitrary proteome by tiling

136

and smoothing kmer sequences across the entire proteome28. PIWAS derives power at both the

137

cohort and single sample level through statistical comparisons to a large database of pre-

138

pandemic controls. Using the reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome from Uniprot, we performed

139

PIWAS of 579 COVID-19 samples compared to 497 pre-pandemic controls, with 1500 additional

140

pre-pandemic controls serving as a normalization cohort. In addition to the established antigens

141

spike and nucleocapsid, we observed highly significant signals for protein 3a, non-structural

142

protein 8 (NSP-8), membrane protein, and replicase polyprotein 1ab (Figure 2A). We further

143

examined epitope-level signal for the top IgG and IgM antigens identified by PIWAS (Figure 2B).

144

Within spike and nucleoprotein, we observed multiple epitopes that are conserved across a

145

large portion of the COVID-19 patient population. In contrast, epitope signals for protein 3a,

146

NSP-8, and membrane protein (IgM) are largely characterized by a single, dominant epitope.

147

While the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike is highly important in host infection by the

148

virus, we observe no conserved epitope signal against this region of spike (amino acids 331-

149

524). Instead, we observe private spike epitopes in a subset of patients in our cohorts (Figure

150

2C, Figure S1). We highlight patients with epitopes observe in multiple longitudinal draws, to

151

decrease the likelihood of false positive signal.

153

Unbiased, proteome-independent epitope analysis
The IMUNE algorithm identified mapping and non-mapping epitope motifs that were

154
155

highly enriched in COVID-19 repertoires (Methods)27. Linear epitopes identified by IMUNE

156

largely overlapped with those identified by PIWAS (Figure 2). The IgG linear motifs mapped to

157

epitopes on spike glycoprotein (n=10), nucleoprotein (n=8) and NSP8 (n=2). IgM linear motifs

158

mapped to a single epitope at the furin cleavage site on spike glycoprotein that was also a

159

target for IgG antibodies, as well as one epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 membrane protein. A

160

significant number of motifs identified by IMUNE did not directly map to linear regions of the

161

SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We have observed from studies with monoclonal antibodies that non-

162

mapping motifs tend to represent mimotopes of both linear and structural epitopes.
Motifs were selected for inclusion in the SARS-CoV-2 epitope map if they demonstrated

163
164

a specificity of at least 98% in 497 pre-pandemic controls (Methods). The resulting SARS-CoV-2

165

panel of 45 IgG and 14 IgM motifs was compiled into a semi-quantitative epitope map, enabling

166

visualization of motif enrichment for all evaluated COVID-19 and control samples (Figure 3A).

167

We observed that an unlabeled, hierarchical clustering of samples based on these motif

168

enrichments largely separates pre-pandemic control samples from COVID-19 patients.

169

Focusing on those motifs with linear hits to SARS-CoV-2, we further observed sub-clusters of

170

patients with reactivity to specific isotypes and antigens, from left-to-right: spike IgG+IgM, spike

171

and membrane IgM, spike IgM, nucleocapsid IgG, and broadly reactive.

172
173

SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic panels can classify NAT+ samples with sensitivity comparable to

174

ELISA

175

To develop a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic panel, we selected a subset of peptide motifs that,

176

in the training cohort, either exhibited high sensitivity and specificity or improved the breadth of

177

coverage (Supplemental Table 2). We normalized and summed motif enrichments to generate

178

a composite score and compared sub-panels to identify the panel with the maximal diagnostic

179

performance on the training cohort (Methods). A composite score of ≥25 was set as a cutoff for

180

both IgG and IgM panels to obtain a specificity of ≥99% on the pre-pandemic training controls

181

(Table 1). The panel performance was evaluated on a test cohort of 427 COVID-19 samples

182

that were confirmed positive by NAT testing (Table 1, testing cohorts I-III). The classifier with the

183

best overall performance is shown in Figure 3B. The sensitivity varied between 54% and 82%

184

across the NAT+ cases from different cohorts, primarily based on the timing of blood collection

185

relative to symptom onset for each cohort. A specificity of 99.3% for IgG and 99.1% for IgM was

186

achieved on a test set of 1500 pre-pandemic repertoires that were tested for acute illness.

187

Combining the IgG and IgM panels into a single test resulted in a panel specificity of 98.7%.

188

Notably, no pre-pandemic samples were co-positive for IgG and M, thus the specificity for

189

subjects that were positive for both IgG and IgM was 100% in the test control set. Forty-two

190

percent of all tested COVID-19 samples met these criteria.

191

We plotted the SERA scores for samples from cohorts I and II, where timing of the blood

192

draw relative to date of symptom onset was provided (Figure 3B). The panel exhibited a

193

sensitivity of 47% at 0-5 days after symptom onset, 64% at 5-10 days and ≥90% at >10 days

194

post symptom onset. Where predicate SARS-CoV-2 ELISA results were available, we

195

compared performance relative to SERA in SARS-CoV-2 NAT+ samples. Overall, SERA IgG

196

and IgM panels together demonstrated similar sensitivity to three different ELISAs in current use

197

(95% CI, Wilson score) (Table 2).

198
199
200

Structural epitope mapping
To further interrogate functional relevance of the identified motifs, we mapped motifs to

201

the surface of published SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein crystal structures. We observed that

202

the linear motif LPFQQ, which has been previously implicated as a neutralizing epitope25,

203

mapped to a single location on the surface of spike glycoprotein (Figure 3C). Using these same

204

methods, we examined possible structural maps of motifs without linear maps to SARS-CoV-2.

205

We highlight one exemplary motif, YWXYFXK which was found to map to the RBD of spike

206

glycoprotein (Figure S2). Based on our previous observations that tryptophan tends to confer

207

structural characteristics on our peptide epitopes, we additionally examined the mapping of the

208

slightly modified motif YXXYFXK which we found also maps strongly to spike (Figure 3C). In

209

addition to the highlighted match to spike, YXXYFXK had two less feasible maps to spike

210

glycoprotein (Figure S2).

211

We also investigated the potential neutralization capacity of these motifs. We plotted the

212

neutralization titer of each sample against the enrichment of the motif in those samples (Figure

213

3D). For both motifs, we observed that higher enrichment values tended to be present in

214

patients with higher titer neutralization activity.

215
216

Motifs and epitopes associated with disease severity

217

Based on prior studies that described subjects with severe disease possessing a

218

stronger and, perhaps, earlier humoral IgG response in both spike and nucleoprotein relative to

219

subjects with mild disease29,30, we examined differences in epitope severity detected by SERA.

220

We compared the SERA IgG panel score (developed to distinguish COVID-19 patients from

221

pre-pandemic controls) across the spectrum of severities present in our population (Figure 4A).

222

We observed a significant elevation of the panel score in patients with severe or moderate

223

disease compared to their mild disease counterparts. To understand the specific epitopes

224

driving the severity delineation, we identified the 10 motifs with the most significant t-test p-value

225

when comparing severe and mild disease (Figure 4B). We observe a potential confounding of

226

days since onset of symptoms with the SERA IgG score (Figure S3). All 10 motifs were

227

identified in the IgG screen and 9 out of 10 motifs did not possess a linear map to SARS-CoV-2.

228

In the hierarchical clustering of samples, we observe subsets of severe patients with preferential

229

enrichment for differing motifs. After splitting our data into 2/3 training and 1/3 testing cohorts,

230

we built a simple LASSO model to classify moderate/severe from mild disease, and observed

231

encouraging performance (training AUC 0.92, testing AUC 0.9, Figure S3).

232

One of the distinguishing features of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is the acquisition of

233

polybasic residues (RRAR) at the cleavage site of the S1/S2 boundary. Cleavage of spike

234

protein at this site is required to enable viral membrane fusion31,32. It has been proposed that

235

this novel sequence enables the virus to take advantage of host proteases, such as furin, that

236

cleave proteins with this recognition sequence, thereby increasing the potential tropism of the

237

virus relative to other coronaviruses31,33. We asked if this site elicited an immune response, and

238

if so, was it seen differentially in subjects with different disease severity. In the spike epitope

239

map, signal at this sequence location is both prominent and prevalent in the cohorts — 120 out

240

of 385, or 31% of subjects, had epitope signals >99% of that seen in controls. We also

241

determined that the site elicited a statistically significantly stronger immune response in subjects

242

with severe disease relative to subjects with mild or moderate disease (Figure 4C). Specifically,

243

39%, 23%, and 20% of severe, moderate, and mild cases, respectively, had strong epitope

244

signals greater than 99% of that in the controls.

245

The novel eight amino acid furin cleavage site (RRAR|SVAS) in spike maps identically to

246

a peptide sequence in one protein in the human proteome, the amiloride sensitive sodium

247

channel ENaC-α protein33. This protein is expressed on the surface of multiple tissues

248

implicated in COVID-19 pathology, and similar to spike, requires cleavage for activation. As the

249

sites share the eight amino acid furin cleavage sequence, not surprisingly, we see a highly

250

correlated PIWAS immune signal in both proteins (Figure S3) that is also statistically stronger in

251

severe disease relative to mild or moderate disease (Figure 4D). We also note that in severe

252

cases, a number of very strong epitopes in ENaC-α outside of the cleavage site are seen

253

relative to mild cases. The signal at both sites was also seen to increase over time, particularly

254

between 2 and 4 weeks, indicating a likely adaptive immune response to this site (Figure S3).

255

In addition to spike and nucleoprotein, a robust immune response has been described

256

against the ORF8 protein34. Several reports have described a variant of SARS-CoV-2 with a

257

382-nucleotide deletion in ORF7b and ORF8 as well as an association of the deletion with a

258

milder disease course35. While we do not have genotype information for all strains, based on the

259

GISAID database we assume that most of the samples in our cohorts do not have this deletion.

260

To explore the possible association of immune response with disease severity, we analyzed the

261

PIWAS signal against ORF8, which encompasses most of the 382-nucleotide deletion. While

262

there appear to be more extremely high signals in severe cases, using an outlier sum statistic,

263

the PIWAS signal in ORF8 does not reach statistical significance in severe cases relative to mild

264

and moderate cases (Figure 4E, F).

265
266
267

PIWAS prediction of antibody cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses
We next investigated SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that may cross-react with other

268

coronaviruses as previous exposure to coronaviruses could have protective or even deleterious

269

effects on symptoms6,7. To identify potential cross-reactive epitopes, we performed PIWAS

270

using the epitope repertoires from COVID-19 samples against various coronavirus proteomes,

271

including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV (SARS), MERS, and the four common human

272

coronaviruses (hCoVs) HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63. Analysis of average PIWAS values for

273

spike glycoprotein across coronaviruses revealed epitopes that were conserved in many

274

coronaviruses as well as epitopes that were specific to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5A). We identified

275

10 epitopes enriched against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (average PIWAS >0.5), two and one

276

of which overlapped with OC43 and NL63 epitopes, respectively. For example, the region

277

corresponding to spike 809-834 in SARS-CoV-2 (alignment indices 1140-1170) contained an

278

epitope that was observed against all coronaviruses analyzed (Figure 5B). However, at spike

279

1141-1162 in SARS-CoV-2 (alignment indices 1500-1525) an epitope was observed only

280

against SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, and OC43 proteomes, with OC43 exhibiting the highest

average PIWAS value. After evaluating enrichment for these cross-reactive spike epitopes in

282

COVID-19 cases with different disease severity, we found there was no statistical difference

283

between severe, moderate, and mild cases (Figure 5C).

284

In contrast to spike, nucleoprotein exclusively contained epitopes specific to SARS-CoV-

285

2 and SARS, with 4 epitopes against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Figure 5D). Strong epitopes

286

were observed against SARS-CoV-2 at regions 150-178 (alignment indices 165-195) and 392-

287

419 (alignment indices 480-510) with no signal observed against hCoVs (Figure 5E). We

288

determined that these nucleoprotein epitopes were significantly enriched in severe and/or

289

moderate cases compared to mild cases (Figure 5F).

Epitope signal in mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains
To study the possible effects of known mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 virus on antibody

293

response, we leveraged the ability of PIWAS to interrogate the SERA database with any

294

sequence of interest. In the 96,437 sequenced strains from GISAID, we enumerated 21,127

295

distinct amino acid mutations to spike glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, envelope protein, and

296

membrane protein36,37. For each mutation, we compared epitope signal against the wild-type

297

(WT) and mutant position in every COVID-19 specimen. We observed a bias towards mutations

298

yielding a decreased PIWAS signal relative to WT (Figure 6A). A subset of these mutations

299

yielded decreased signal across a large number of COVID-19 patients (Figure 6B). To assess

300

the significance of this decreased epitope signal, we in silico randomly mutated amino acids

301

throughout the same protein sequences as a null distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

302

comparing the observed and null distributions was highly significant (p=3e-11), indicating that

303

the bias towards mutants that generate a decreased epitope signal exceeds that which would

304

be explained purely due to chance (Figure S4). For membrane protein, nucleoprotein, and spike

305

glycoprotein, we highlight exemplar mutations which resulted in decreased epitope signal

306

across a large number of patients (Figure 6C) and, in the case of spike glycoprotein, are on the

surface of the protein according to the crystal structures considered in this paper31,32. In

308

contrast, the dominant spike glycoprotein D614G exhibits no epitope signal for either the wild-

309

type or mutant strains (Figure 6D).

Discussion
While conventional serology is a cornerstone of infectious disease diagnosis, the

313

COVID-19 pandemic has raised many questions not answered by these testing modalities

314

alone. Here we have shown that high-content random bacterial peptide display library screening

315

using SERA provides a tool to broadly and deeply probe individual antibody repertoires. These

316

profiles, both individually and in the aggregate, can yield insights into disease severity,

317

immunity, cross-reactivity to other coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains), and

318

autoimmune sequelae.

319

By taking a focused, proteome-constrained approach to identifying signal against the

320

SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we both reiterate the established immunological relevance of spike and

321

nucleoprotein as well as identify less described signals against protein 3a and NSP-8. Epitope-

322

level characterization of these antigens highlights particularly immunogenic epitopes within each

323

protein, which might serve as targets in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. In

324

particular, we identified strong epitopes in nucleoprotein including at amino acids 158-172 and

325

the C-terminal domain 380-419, as well as epitopes in spike glycoprotein including at amino

326

acids 555-572, 810-828, and 1145-1159, consistent with previous studies4,24,38. Additionally, we

327

highlight novel and less-studied epitopes, including a dominant IgM epitope from membrane

328

protein (amino acids 1-12) which could provide utility in early diagnostics. While we did not

329

observe spike RBD epitopes that were conserved across the patient cohort, we found

330

compelling examples of private RBD epitopes. The lack of linear epitopes towards spike RBD is

331

unsurprising given the complex structural nature of spike, with many strands running in parallel

332

likely yielding an abundance of structural mimotopes (also reflected in the quantity of non-

333

mapping motifs in our diagnostic panel).

334

Leveraging our database of thousands of pre-pandemic repertoires collected from

335

healthy individuals as well as people with infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancer across

336

all age groups and geographies, we were able to assess the specificity of the SARS-CoV-2

337

antibody response and identify a panel of epitopes that could distinguish COVID-19 cases from

338

controls with accuracy similar to conventional serological testing.

339

We further investigated the possible origins of the non-mapping motifs by attempting to

340

map them structurally to spike glycoprotein. We validated the mapping by showing that it

341

accurately identifies the linear motif LPFQQ, and then applied the method to non-mapping

342

motifs. We find that the motif YWXYFXK exclusively maps to the RBD. However, previous

343

observations have suggested that tryptophan (W) may be more important for conferring

344

structure to the mimotope than for identity mapping, yet still the more general motif YXXYFXK

345

maps to RBD as well. When combined with the neutralization titers of samples in which this

346

motif is enriched, it is possible to speculate about the mechanism of neutralization. If the

347

antibodies that recognize this motif bind to the RBD of spike glycoprotein, they may block the

348

ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to ACE2 and inhibit viral entry and infection.

349

One of the ongoing areas of development in this approach is that while we have

350

assumed that the identity of the residues remains constant between motif and the epitope, it is

351

possible that amino acid substitutions could be allowed. We have attempted a first pass to

352

mitigate this by allowing for a more general mapping with the modification of the W to an X, but

353

we continue to iterate on this model to more accurately account for residue mismatches in

354

mapping motifs to the structure. While these methods are still under development, the results

355

here demonstrate the applications of such a method.

356

Consistent with previous studies, we find that the humoral immune response against

357

SARS-CoV-2 is stronger in severe and moderate disease relative to mild disease4,39,40. This

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.23.20235002; this version posted November 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this

358

finding is consistent with a general pattern of disease associated with immunopathology in

359

COVID-19. We also identified specific epitope profiles that correlate with disease severity and

360

combined these epitopes into a preliminary disease severity classification model. To further

361

validate these findings we would require a separate, validation cohort of patients which span

362

mild and severe disease states. Importantly, many of our disease severity analyses are

363

potentially confounded by the number of days since onset of symptoms in the COVID-19

364

subpopulations, partially due to the challenge of both identifying disease onset in mild patients

365

and collecting samples from non-hospitalized patients.

366

Using in silico analysis of repertoires on the human proteome, we are also able to

367

identify candidate cross-reactive or novel autoantigen epitopes that may be important in disease

368

pathogenesis. The polybasic cleavage site seen in SARS-CoV-2 is unique among

369

coronaviruses and potentially enables it to increase its tissue tropism33. We demonstrate that

370

the immune response at this site is predicted to be both significantly prominent and prevalent

371

relative to a pre-pandemic cohort, as well as significantly stronger in severe and moderate

372

versus mild disease. The sequence is shared with the amiloride sensitive sodium channel

373

ENaC-α, which is responsible for sodium influx into tissue41. Disruption of this channel in

374

individuals with variants has been associated with pulmonary edema and alveoloar fluid

375

overload40,42. Thus, this channel has been investigated in SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory

376

illnesses for possible pathogenic implication in disease and as a target for therapy43.

377

Our finding that immune signal at this site is significantly elevated suggests the

378

possibility of molecular mimicry with potential pathogenic consequences. While we do not have

379

direct evidence of binding of antibody to ENaC-α at this site, functional blockage of the site

380

could be postulated to prevent the cleavage of the ENaC-α channel, which is necessary for

381

channel activation43. The signal against this site increases over time in the majority of cases

382

indicating an adaptive immune response, but the effect of this response on pathogenicity is

383

unclear as binding at the spike site could in fact reduce infectivity of the virus. A recent study

384

has also noted that binding at this site reduces the RBD-ACE2 binding energy, and therefore

385

could be a potential site for neutralizing antibodies44. Functional analyses and experiments are

386

thus required to investigate whether cross-reactivity occurs and to distinguish the effect of

387

antibodies binding to either the viral or host antigens at this site. The ability to query potential

388

autoantigen signal using SERA in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and epitopes is an area

389

for continued inquiry given the mounting data supporting the significance of autoantigens in the

390

immunopathology of COVID-1910,45.

391

Milder disease has been described in subjects with the 382-ORF8 deletion variant, and

392

the ORF8 protein has been noted to be associated with strong humoral response35,46. In our

393

study, we also see significant response relative to a pre-pandemic cohort in ORF8. While a few

394

epitopes appear quite strong in some individuals in ORF8 with severe disease, the overall signal

395

across the antigen was not seen to be statistically significant in mild versus severe disease.

396

Specific, strong epitope signals in ORF8 could be postulated to contribute to severe disease

397

through a variety of mechanisms, but this would also need to be explored through further

398

epidemiological and experimental analysis.

399

By evaluating epitope signal in COVID-19 cases against common human coronavirus

400

(hCoV) proteomes, we predicted prevalent cross-reactive epitopes particularly in the S2 domain

401

of spike. Given the strength and prevalence of these cross-reactive epitopes, it is plausible that

402

previous exposure to hCoVs contributed to these antibody responses, a boosting phenomenon

403

recently described in COVID-19 cases47. In particular, the cross-reactive epitope at spike amino

404

acids 809-834 near the fusion domain has been shown to elicit an antibody response in SARS-

405

CoV-2 uninfected adolescents and adults48. Interestingly, antibodies targeting this epitope

406

demonstrated neutralizing capacity using antibody depletion assays38. More broadly, the

407

presence of spike-reactive T cells in healthy donors has been observed against SARS-CoV-2 as

408

well as hCoVs 229E and OC43, primarily reactive towards the spike S2 domain6. While these

409

findings suggest a role for cross-reactive epitopes in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is

410

uncertain what impact pre-existing antibodies have towards protection, immunity, and disease

411

progression. Recent studies suggest that pre-existing antibodies from hCoVs exist but are not

412

associated with protection47,49. We observed that prevalent cross-reactive epitopes in spike

413

were not associated with COVID-19 severity while multiple nucleoprotein epitopes specific to

414

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS were significantly enriched in severe cases compared to mild. Notably,

415

it has been shown that convalescent COVID-19 patients exhibited a shift in antibody response

416

towards spike compared to a nucleoprotein-directed antibody response in deceased patients3.

417

Given that cross-reactive epitopes were observed in spike, additional investigation will be critical

418

towards understanding pre-existing antibody responses that may impact SARS-CoV-2 infection

419

and COVID-19 progression.

420

The decreased epitope signal in COVID-19 patients against mutant strains of SARS-

421

CoV-2 compared to WT is suggestive of evolutionary evasion of the antibody response50–52.

422

Under this hypothesis, SARS-CoV-2 strains are undergoing selective pressure to evade

423

antibody response, resulting in strains that may be less susceptible to clearance by those

424

previously infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-253,54. While these observations do not inherently

425

indicate greater infectivity, the public health consequences of epitope mutation are concerning

426

and further suggestive of the potential for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to periodically re-emerge and

427

reinfect individuals with prior exposure. While not conclusive, these observations reveal the

428

importance of monitoring epitope mutations and could be used to guide therapeutic and vaccine

429

development efforts to focus on epitopes that are less susceptible to evasion, which would be

430

more broadly cross-reactive and robust to evolutionary changes.

431

The dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 which is now in circulation possesses the D614G

432

mutation. Based on our data, neither the wild-type nor the mutant confer a significant linear

433

epitope, consistent with observations that the mutation is most notable for its effect on the

434

structure of spike55.

435

We acknowledge various limitations with the SERA platform that impact this study. Much

436

of this study has focused on dominant epitopes prevalent in COVID-19 cases, but many of the

437

private epitopes not explicitly discussed here, particularly in spike RBD, are critical to fully

438

understanding the protective antibody response and clinical outcomes. Moreover, there are

439

clear limitations for probing the epitope repertoire with linear peptides, chiefly the challenges of

440

identifying structural epitopes and the role of post-translational modifications such as glycans56.

441

While a random peptide library enables unique opportunities to identify structural mimics, much

442

work remains in cataloguing and mapping these mimics to their cognate antigens.

443

In summary, we present the application of SERA to assess SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity

444

and to characterize a high-resolution map of motifs and epitopes in individuals and populations.

445

We demonstrate the ability of the platform to assess disease severity, to identify structural

446

motifs associated with neutralization, to compare in silico epitope response to multiple

447

coronavirus strains, to assess potential immune escape at sites of variation, to evaluate

448

longitudinal changes in signal, and to reveal potential autoantigen response, all with one assay.

449

The random nature of the libraries, the ability to identify linear mimics of structural epitopes, and

450

the ability to leverage quality-controlled reference data from a large pre-pandemic cohort all

451

contribute to SERA’s ability to elucidate the humoral immune response in SARS-CoV-2

452

infection.

453

Our findings support those of other studies that find clear differences in the humoral

454

response of individuals with different clinical severity and trajectories. While we may identify

455

associations between high resolution epitope and motif signals and disease severity, much work

456

is required to establish functional or causal relationships. Examining and correlating epitopes to

457

clinical efficacy in the context of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies will help to elucidate the

458

connection between measured immune response and patient outcome.

460

Yet the epitope landscape can change, as it is already clear that coronaviruses mutate

clinical features in populations world-wide55,57–60. We have demonstrated the ability to capture

and query both past and present repertoires through analysis of both pre-pandemic and current

contamination with mycoplasma. SARS-CoV-2, strain USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from BEI

551

Resources (#NR-52281) and was amplified in VeroE6 cells. Cells were infected at a MOI 0.01

552

for four three days to generate a working stock and after incubation the supernatant was

553

clarified by centrifugation (450g × 5min) and filtered through a 0.45-micron filter. The pelleted

554

virus was then resuspended in PBS then aliquoted for storage at − 80°C. Viral titers were

555

measured by standard plaque assay using Vero E6 cells. Briefly, 300ul of serial fold virus

556

dilutions were used to infect Vero E6 cells in MEM supplemented NaHCO3, 4% FBS 0.6%

557

Avicel RC-581. Plaques were resolved at 48hrs post infection by fixing in 10% formaldehyde for

558

1 hour followed by with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol staining. Plates were rinsed in water

559

to plaques enumeration. All experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 with the Yale

560

Environmental Health and Safety office approval.

Patient and healthy donor sera were isolated as before and then heat treated for 30m

564

at 56 °C. Sixfold serially diluted plasma, from 1:3 to 1:2430 were incubated with SARS-CoV-2

565

for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixture was subsequently incubated with VeroE6 cells in a 6-well plate for

566

1hour, for adsorption. Then, cells were overlayed with MEM supplemented NaHCO3, 4% FBS

567

0.6% Avicel mixture. Plaques were resolved at 40hrs post infection by fixing in 10%

PIWAS analysis

573

We applied the previously published PIWAS method28 to identify antigen and epitope

574

signals against the Uniprot reference SARS-CoV-2 proteome (UP000464024)61. The PIWAS

575

analysis was run on the IgG SERA data with a single sample per COVID-19 patient (for a total

576

of 579 patients) versus 497 discovery pre-pandemic controls, and the 1500 validation controls

577

used as the normalization cohort. Additional parameters include: a smoothing window size of 5

578

5mers and 5 6mers; z-score normalization of kmer enrichments; maximum peak value; and

579

generation of epitope level tiling data. Antigens were ranked using the Mann-Whitney U false

580

discovery rate, following the hypotheses of conserved epitopes in the context of infectious

581

disease. For top antigens, tiling data was generated for every case and control sample. 95th

582

quantile bands were calculated based on each population separately. The most significant RBD

583

epitopes were identified in COVID-19 patients with draws from at least 2 timepoints and a

584

PIWAS value of at least 6 occurring between the 319th and 541st amino acids.

589

hospitalized subjects from the Yale IMPACT study were used for motif discovery. The majority

590

of subjects were confirmed SARS CoV-2 positive by nucleic acid testing (NAT). IMUNE

591

compared ~30 disease repertoires with ~30 pre-pandemic controls and identified peptide

592

patterns that were statistically enriched (p value ≤ 0.01) in ≥25% of disease and absent from

593

100% of controls. Multiple assessments were run with different subsets of cases and controls

594

both for IgG and IgM. Peptide patterns identified by IMUNE were clustered using a PAM30

595

matrix and combined into motifs. The output of IMUNE included hundreds of candidate IgG and

596

IgM motifs. A motif was classified as positive in a given sample if the enrichment was ≥4 times

597

the standard deviation above the mean of the training control set. The candidate motifs were

598

further refined based on at least 98% specificity. The final set of motifs was validated for

599

sensitivity and specificity on an additional 1500 pre-pandemic controls and 406 unique

600

confirmed COVID-19 cases from four separate cohorts (test cohorts I-IV, Table 1).

601
602

Development of a diagnostic classifier for COVID-19

603

To generate a diagnostic score that classified subjects as serologically positive for

604

antibodies to COVID-19, motif enrichment values were normalized using the mean and standard

605

deviation of enrichments within the training set of pre-pandemic control repertoires. Individual

606

SARS-CoV-2 motif normalized “z-scores” were then summed to obtain a composite score for

607

each sample. A composite score of 25 was established as a cutoff for positivity for each panel to

608

obtain a specificity of >99% on the pre-pandemic training controls.

609
610
611

Structural motif mapping
Structural motif mapping was carried out by identifying a network of neighboring

612

residues on the surface of a protein structure and looking in that network for matches to the

613

motif of interest. Neighboring residues were residues which had ⍺-carbons within 8 Å. The

614

surface of the protein structure was calculated using the MSMS program62 with a probe radius

615

of 2.5 Å. These values are line with other algorithms for mapping mimotopes to structures63,64

616

and were further optimized using our in-house dataset of monoclonal antibodies (data not

617

shown).

618

Once each match to a motif was found in the surface network of neighbors, each residue

619

is scored by the number of ways it was found to match to a motif. For example, the motif SE[RI]

620

might map to SER on the surface, and additionally to SEI on the surface, where the same S and

621

E are used. In this case, S would have a value of 2, E would have a value of 2, while R would

622

get a value of 1, and I would get a value of 1. Each residue was then colored according to these

623

values to produce the heat maps shown in the figures.

624

Structures used were downloaded from rcsb.org65,66. Due to the recent focus on SARS-

625

CoV-2 there are many structures for spike glycoprotein in PDB. The following structures were

626

chosen due to their high sequence coverage, and in order to represent a variety of

627

conformations and binding states to ACE2: 6ZGG,6ZGI,7A93,7A95,7A9731,32. PDB structures

628

were processed with Biopython67,68 and visualized with PyMol69.

629
630

Mild versus severe disease analysis

631

For samples where clinical severity was known, we compared SERA IgG panel scores

632

using the outlier sum statistic28,70. Using a t-test, we compared enrichments for all IgG and IgM

633

motifs between the severe/moderate and mild populations. The 10 most significant motifs were

634

highlighted and hierarchically clustered (Euclidean distance, Ward clustering71). Severity based

635

on PIWAS signal against the furin cleavage and ORF8 regions was similarly compared using

636

the outlier sum statistic. To identify potential auto-antigenic signal against ENAC-α, a PIWAS

637

analysis was performed (using the same parameters as above) using the Uniprot61 reference

638

human proteome (UP000005640).

641

We identified Uniprot reference proteomes for the four common human coronaviruses

642

[OC43 (UP00007552), HKU1 (UP000122230), 229E (UP0006716), and NL63 (UP000145724)]

643

and more severe strains [SARS (UP000000354) and MERS(UP000171868)]61. For each

644

proteome, we ran a PIWAS with the same parameters as the SARS-CoV-2 PIWAS (above). For

645

spike glycoprotein and nucleoprotein, we averaged PIWAS tiling values for the COVID-19

646

cohort across each proteome. A multiple sequence alignment of all these coronavirus

647

sequences was performed using Clustal Omega72. Using this alignment index, we identified

648

regions of divergent and convergent signal across the coronavirus proteomes in the COVID-19

649

population. For regions of interest, we calculated the significance of differences in patient

650

severity using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.

SARS-CoV-2 strain analysis
For each of the 96,437 SARS-CoV-2 proteomes, we identified amino acid mutations

662

relative to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain (hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019). Incomplete

663

proteomes were not considered. A total of 21,127 unique amino acid mutations were identified

664

across spike glycoprotein, membrane protein, envelope protein, and nucleoprotein. For each

665

mutation, a region of 10 flanking amino acids on either side was considered as the mutated

666

region, for comparison against the same length wild-type region. For every sample, we

calculated and compared PIWAS scores for the wild-type and mutant sequences. To assess

significance of the observed bias, we generated in silico random mutations to these same

Figure 1: The Serum Epitope Repertoire Analysis (SERA) platform enables high
resolution mapping of SARS-CoV-2 antibody repertoires. The SERA assay results in a set
of approximately 1 million unique peptides, the “epitope repertoire”, for each individual.
Repertoires were deposited in a database and compared with pre-pandemic controls to identify
conserved epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 using proteome-dependent and -independent bioinformatic
methods. SERA enables analysis of COVID-19 repertoires against any proteome including
mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains, human common coronaviruses and the human proteome for
discovery of potential autoantigens. The identified epitope signatures can be used to build
diagnostic classifiers, to identify correlates of disease severity, and to develop hypotheses
based on cases with specific symptoms and/or disease course (neurological, GI, cardio e.g.).

Figure 2: Bioinformatic analysis of SERA antibody repertoires identifies the antigens and
epitopes involved in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response. (A) PIWAS statistical ranking
of kmer enrichments across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome using the Mann-Whitney false
discovery rate (FDR). Multiple antigens in addition to spike and nucleoprotein showed significant
enrichment for one or more epitopes. (B) PIWAS kmer enrichments from COVID-19 repertoires
versus pre-pandemic controls across statistically significant antigens. PIWAS values = number
of standard deviations above the mean of 1500 pre-pandemic controls. IMUNE motifs largely
mapped to the same epitopes that were identified by PIWAS. Epitopes on spike
and nucleoprotein discovered by IMUNE are shown below each antigen (orange bars).
(C) Longitudinal samples from individual subjects enabled identification of RBD-specific signals
that emerged over time but were not conserved across COVID-19 patients.

immune response. (A) Heatmap of IgG and IgM motif log-enrichment values for 579 COVID-19
samples and 1500 pre-pandemic controls. Inset highlights motifs with linear epitope maps to
SARS-CoV-2. (B) Sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM diagnostic classifier
in NAT+ subjects and pre-pandemic controls. Z-scores for each motif were summed to generate
an IgG/IgM composite score. The maximum value for the IgG or IgM for each sample is
shown. Samples above a cutoff of 25 are classified as positive. The sensitivity or specificity of
the SERA panels for all COVID-19 cohorts and controls is shown above each column. (C)
Candidate structural mappings for the linear motif LPFQQ and non-mapping motif YWXYFXK
(through its related variant YXXYFXK). Inset highlights the key contact amino acid residues for
the proposed structural localizations of the motifs. (PDB codes: 7A95 and 6ZGG
respectively). (D) Neutralization titer vs. log-enrichment for each motif (LFPQQ and YWXYFXK)
shows that samples with the highest enrichment for either motif tend to have higher titer
neutralization activity.

Figure 5: Cross-reactivity analysis across coronaviruses reveals shared epitopes and
epitopes specific to SARS-CoV-2. PIWAS was performed using COVID-19 samples against
various coronavirus proteomes including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, and the common hCoVs
HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63. PIWAS tilings for (A) spike and (D) nucleoprotein revealed
regions of cross-reactivity as well as epitopes only observed against SARS-CoV-2. Clustal
multiple sequence alignments were performed and visualized below to depict sequence
similarity and divergence. Distinct epitopes from (B) spike and (E) nucleoprotein showcase
PIWAS values across the coronaviruses with corresponding clustal alignment sequences below.
Epitope locations are denoted with asterisks in (A) and (D). Distribution of PIWAS values at

Figure 6: Mutations to SARS-CoV-2 are biased towards decreasing immune epitope
response. 21,127 distinct amino acid mutations in spike glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, envelope
protein, and membrane protein in SARS-CoV-2 strains were identified from sequencing data of
96,437 genomes from GISAID. (A) For each mutation, the PIWAS value of the wild-type (WT)
sequence was compared to the PIWAS value for the mutated strain (mut). (B) Mutations
conferring a significant PIWAS value change (|PIWASWT-PIWASmut| > 3) for each COVID-19
sample were identified. For each mutation, the number of patients with a significant difference
was counted. (C) Exemplary mutations that yielded a decrease in PIWAS values are shown for
membrane protein (top row), nucleoprotein (middle row), and spike (bottom row). (D) No
significant immune signal is seen at location 614 of spike, for either the wild-type or the D614G
variant.
