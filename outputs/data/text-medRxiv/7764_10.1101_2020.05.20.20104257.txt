Abstract
Introduction: The highly heterogenous disease transmission pattern of COVID-19 suggests that the
pandemic maybe driven by complex factors, which may include habitat suitability, region specific human
mobility, and transmission related to susceptibility. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects
of different spatial and demographic factors on COVID-19 transmission and case fatality worldwide.
Methods: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 related fatalities in 50 countries in
all continents of the globe. Data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for
Systems Science and Engineering, the European center for disease control and prevention, and the World
Health Organization were used to obtain the daily number of cases and organize incidence data. Disease
spread was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across the sampled countries. R
statistical software’s R0 package was used to estimate the reproduction number of the COVID19 using the
exponential growth method. After computing the reproductive number of each country in the study, a
multiple linear regression model was fitted using R0 value as dependent variable, and latitude and
population density as an independent variable. Disease severity was analyzed using the case fatality ratio
of COVID-19. The proportion of deaths were meta-analyzed using the R statistical software’s metaphor
package, using random effect inverse variance weighting to come up with the case fatality ratio.
Results: We found no statistically significant association between disease spread and latitude or
population density. The regression model analysis that accounted for age, population density and latitude
showed that age distribution remains an important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID-19
cases. The relative frequency of people above 65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative
numbers of COVID-19 cases as well as case fatality ratio in each country. The multiple linear regression
model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that, the demographic distribution of
the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio. Correlation with proportion of
populations over 65 years old is concordant with the previous findings relationship between case fatality
ratio and patient age.
Conclusion: This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global
health authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID19 are associated
with age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high-risk
groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID-19.

Introduction
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (termed SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia – also known as
Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) – began to appear in the city of Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei
Province, in Central China (30.60°N – 114.05°E). As of May 15, 2020, at 6:00pm (ET), the Johns Hopkins
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering reported that there have been 4,586,915
confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 279,597 deaths. In comparison, there were 774 reported
deaths from the 2003 SARS outbreak. The five countries hardest hit by COVID-19 have been the United
States (1,450,269 cases), Russia (272,043 cases), United Kingdom (241,455 cases), Spain (230,698 cases),
and Italy (223,885 cases). [1]
On Jan 30, 2020, WHO declared the current novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic a
Public Health Emergency of International Concern. [2] All continents have reported confirmed cases of
COVID-19. Africa confirmed its first case in Egypt on Feb 14, 2020. An initial assessment of the outbreak
by Li and colleagues estimated that in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the epidemic
doubled in size every 7.4 days and the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.2. [3]
It has been challenging to accurately track the spread, because of factors such as the lack of rapid
diagnostic tests and the mildness of the symptoms in some infected people. SARS‐CoV‐2 shares 88%
sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat‐SLCoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21, 79%
identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle
Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.[4] The case fatality ratio (CFR) for cases outside
China was initially estimated to be 2.2% (95% confidence interval, 0.6%-5.8%). [5] A recent study of the
symptomatic case fatality risk (the probability of dying from the infection after developing symptoms) in
Wuhan found that the overall risk was 1.4% in patients aged 15 years or older. [6]
The virus has rapidly spread worldwide, and future scenarios remain highly uncertain. Modelling by the
Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team in London predicted approximately 510,000 deaths in Great
Britain and 2.2 million in the US, not accounting for the potential negative effects of health systems
being overwhelmed on mortality. [7] This is argued as a worst-case scenario, which even if true would
be mitigated by the many people who would be minimally or mildly symptomatic.
The disease transmission pattern of COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous suggesting that the pandemic
maybe driven by complex factors, which may include habitat suitability, region-specific human mobility,
and transmission related to susceptibility.[8] Some countries such as Vietnam had cases from the
earliest stage of the outbreak but experienced a relatively moderate increase in new cases, whereas
others such as the UK and the USA have been suffering serious epidemic. Therefore, identifying the
driving force of the outbreak pattern is urgently needed for predicting infection and mortality risks in
the remaining less affected countries of the world.
In terms of mortality, case fatality rate for COVID-19 have been previously shown to be associated with
age, comorbidities and sex. [9] Other studies also suggest that country-specific case fatality ration and
incidence are corelated with latitude and temperature. [10-11] Several other studies show that
population age structure may explain the variation in fatalities across countries. For example, Italy is one

of the oldest populations, with 23.3% of its population over 65 years, characterized by significant
intergenerational contacts and residential proximity between adult children and parents. [12] The
Korean outbreak was also concentrated among the young Shincheonji religious group, with only 4.5% of
cases thus far falling into the >80-y group. [13] This contributed to a low overall CFR in South Korea
relative to Italy (1.6% vs. 10.6%). The hypothesis that warmer temperatures will slow the spread of the
COVID-19 virus has been a point of much debate. However, early comparisons between the number of
confirmed cases in the worst affected European countries and the West African countries with
confirmed COVID-19 cases do not support the hypothesis that the virus will spread more slowly in
countries with warmer climates. [14] The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of different
spatial and demographic factors on COVID-19 transmission and case fatality worldwide.

Methods:
We assessed SARS-Cov-2 virus transmission and COVID-19 related fatalities in 50 countries in all
continents of the globe.
Sampling
More than 200 countries and territories that have reported the virus were initially included as “target
population”. We first excluded countries that have not reported COVID-19 related death, as of April 29,
leaving the eligible sampling frame size at 172. In the same way, to better understand the transmission
of the virus and allow of meaningful comparison and interpretation of the results countries that
reported less than 100 cases and those countries that began reporting cases only recently (end of
March) were excluded from the sampling frame. Hence the sampling frame was finally reduced to 105
countries.
A sampling frame of 105 countries with a 10 % marginal error and 95% confidence interval yielded a
total sample size of 50 countries. Hence a purposive sampling of 50 countries across the globe was
carried out to have fair representation from different geographical locations.

Fig 1: Sampling procedure

Data source
We used data from the COVID-19 data repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and
Engineering (Baltimore, MD, USA) to obtain the cumulative number of cases since the diagnosis of the
first patient by country. Data from the European center for disease control and prevention and the
World Health Organization’s daily situational report were used to obtain the daily number of cases and
organize the incidence data. [15] The 2018 World bank report was used to obtain data on the
demographic distribution given by the proportion of the elderly population, and population density
given by the total number of people living per square kilometer of area for each country that are
included in the study. [16]
Analysis approach
The two major variables of the study namely disease transmission and disease fatalities were assessed
for the fifty countries sampled using the latest data from the above data sources.
The first variable, disease severity (fatality), was analyzed using the case fatality ratio of COVID-19,
which is defined as the proportion of people with COVID-19 (that is, with a positive test result) who die
as a direct or indirect consequence of their infection. [17] Despite its tendency to overestimate fatality
due to undertesting and a time-lag bias the CFR seems to remain the best tool to express the fatality of
the disease, even though it might underestimate this figure in the initial phase of an outbreak. In
addition to the reported case fatality ratio, the pooled estimate of CFR was calculated for the sampled
countries. The proportion of deaths to the total numbers of cases was meta-analyzed using the R
statistical software’s metaphor package, using random-effect inverse-variance weighting to estimate the
case fatality ratio. To see the potential association that CFR with other factors, a multiple linear

regression model was fitted and the effect of demography (explained by the proportion of population
above 65 years old) and population density was analyzed.
The second variable, disease spread, was assessed using the reproduction number of the disease across
the sampled countries. In doing so the R statistical software’s R0 package was used to estimate the
reproduction number of the COVID-19 using the exponential growth method given by the equation
1

R = 1𝑀(−𝑟)
where M is the moment generating function of the (discretized) generation time distribution, and r is the
exponential growth rate. [18]
A time frame in each country’s epidemiologic curve, where the growth of cases followed an exponential
trajectory, was chosen for the analysis. In computing the reproductive number, an earlier study in
Wuhan China, that has estimated the serial interval of the disease was used to compute the generation
time, hence the serial interval was fitted with gamma distribution by taking the mean and standard
deviation of the disease as 7.5 and 3.4 days respectively.[3] After computing the reproductive number of
each country in the study, a multiple linear regression model was fitted by taking the R0 value as
dependent variable, latitude and population density as an independent variable. In all the regression
models a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to declare a result as statistically significant.

Results
Disease transmission Analysis:
To assess the disease spread, the reproductive number of COVID-19 was computed in all the sampled
countries. The average reproductive number of the sampled countries was 2.1 [95% CI 2.018008 2.164926]. To see the impact of proximity to the equator (explained by latitude) and population density
on the disease spread, a multiple linear regression model was fitted by having the R0 of the sampled
countries as a dependent variable with latitude and population density as an independent variable. The
regression output revealed that there is no statistically significant association between the disease
spread, explained by the reproductive number, latitude and population density.

Case fatality analysis
The random effect meta-analysis resulted in a pooled case fatality ratio of 3.32% [95% CI: 2.85, -3.86; ].
The pooled overall estimate of the case fatality (weighted average) among the sampled countries is
lower than the arithmetic mean of CFR (4.62 and 3.86 for the arithmetic mean and pooled estimate
respectively) and this can be explained by the high heterogeneity between the studied countries. As it is
illustrated on figure ), the 50 countries covered in this study has exhibited a noticeable difference in the
case fatality ratio, ranging from 15% in Belgium to less than 1% in some African countries.

The multiple linear regression model fitted between CFR and the three major covariates showed that,
the demographic distribution of the sampled countries is strongly associated with the case fatality ratio.
Countries that have a very high proportion of elderly population (proportion of population above 65
years of age) were found to have a higher case fatality rate. An increase in the elderly population
proportion by 1% was associated with an increase in CFR by 0.32.

Discussion
Several studies that have assessed the epidemiology of COVID-19 principally focused on variables such
as pollution, underlying comorbidities in infected individual, and other socioenvironmental factors to
identify potential risk factors correlated with disease transmission and mortality. [19 – 25] Although
these previous works have examined the effects of these variables on COVID-19 spread and fatality,
most of the studies looked at effects of independently and did not control for the potentially
confounding interactions between variables. Parameters of the COVID-19 pandemic that we have
analyzed herein are important for predicting the spread and managing the ongoing outbreak.
Particularly, cross-country comparisons of CFR and RR as important indicators of disease spread and
severity are vital for setting priority for public health response and monitoring health system capacity
and performance. Nevertheless, the magnitude of undetected cases or the length of delay in case
reporting can significantly affect CFR and RR and can confound the estimations.
In this study, we sought to investigate COVID-19 spread and mortality worldwide through a more
broader framework that accounts for effects of age distribution, population density, and latitude
variables to show important correlations for the epidemiological parameters of the 50 countries or
territories analyzed. By conducting sequential multivariate analyses of these variables our study aims to
more comprehensively characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and thereby identify particular
noticeable risk factors and vulnerable population groups.
A number of studies have established that in the Northern Hemisphere, influenza is more widely spread
during the winter seasons, and that influenza virus transmission and virulence depend also on
meteorological conditions such as temperature and relative humidity. A similar behavior has been
observed for other SARS coronaviruses that belong to the same Coronaviridae family of SARS-CoV-2. [26
– 27]
Our study included data from a range of countries and climatic regions. Our regression model analysis
that accounted for age, population density and latitude showed that age distribution remains an
important driver shaping the current distribution of COVID-19 cases. The relative frequency of people ≥
65 years old was positively correlated with the cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases as well as case
fatality ratio in each country. Correlation with proportion of populations over 65 years old is concordant
with the previous findings relationship between case fatality ratio and patient age. [9] In other previous
studies environmental factors that influence the relationship between temperature and mortality, such
as latitude, humidity, and sociodemographic factors have been reported. [28 – 30]
We found no significant association for the parameters analyzed with population density. Previously
spotted correlation of population density with virus spread and mortality requires further investigation
before concluding that there is a correlation. We also examined possible association of incidence and
mortality with country centroid latitude. Although human mobility and host susceptibility were main
drivers in the spread of COVID-19, the potential role of latitude as a factor of COVID-19 burden was not
further supported by our finding regarding latitude which did not suggest any protective effect of
tropical climates. However, other studies analysis suggests that hemisphere might influence mortality
(the latter seems to be higher in the Northern Hemisphere, p = 0.036) and thus does not contradict the

idea that outdoor temperature could impact chances for patient recovery. [31] Other studies have also
reported that temperature and humidity are associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. [32] Therefore,
although humidity was not considered in our research because of the lack of sufficient information on
this variable, precipitation seems to be an important factor that must be further examined.

Limitations
Our analysis only included countries with sufficient data, and relied heavily on publicly available sources,
which may not always be consistent with the actual value of various statistics for each countries. Many
countries were excluded from analysis for lack of adequate Covid-19 cases or lack of Covid-19 deaths.
This limitation is unavoidable as waiting for sufficient data may deter timely generation of evidence for
appropriate public health response. This study is also limited by the fact the COVID-19 pandemic is at
different stages in different countries while still spreading across the globe. The number of cases and
mortality statistics we used only provide snapshots of the current state for the countries and will not be
representative of the cumulative COVID-19 cases and mortality numbers for the counties. Confounding
effects are also possible, given that it is impossible to fully disentangle socioeconomic and demographic
variables from each other. Specifically, our study does not take into account variables relevant to local
factors associated with community spread or containment measures implemented against the epidemic
in individual countries.

Conclusion
This study assessed the independent effects of latitude, age distribution and population density on the
transmission rate of cases and mortality of COVID-19 worldwide. In multivariate regression analyses that
controlled for country demographics, latitude and population density, countries with higher proportion
of elderly population were associated with increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our findings showed
no correlation between a country's population density and the number of COVID-19 cases or mortality,
and no correlation between latitude and mortality or rate of spread of COVID-19.
This analysis provides important information that can inform the decisions of local and global health
authorities. Particularly, as our study confirms that death and severity of COVID-19 are associated with
age, in countries with the biggest outbreaks, strategies must be employed to ensure that high-risk
groups, such as old people received adequate protection from COVID-19.
