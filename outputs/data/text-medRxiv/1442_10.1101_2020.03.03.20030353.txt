Epidemiological and clinical features of 291 cases with coronavirus disease 2019
in areas adjacent to Hubei, China: a double-center observational study

Abstract
Background: The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Hubei and other areas are different. We
aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan
which is adjacent to Hubei.
Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with
laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in
Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients’ electronic medical records
were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical
outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020.
Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group
(72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were
male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to
Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%,
p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were
common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were
bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and
eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was
detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%)
patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively.
Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil,

Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK–MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of
lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p<0.01). Most patients received antiviral
therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged
and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged
patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15).
Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is
different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical
group and moderate group were higher than mild group. Laboratory and imaging examination can
assist in the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

In December 2019, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, and quickly
spread to other Chinese provinces and 38 countries around the world up to February 26, 2020. Owing
to its involvement in multiple areas, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International
Concern on January 30, 2020. Up to February 26, 2020, there were 78,630 laboratory-confirmed and
clinical-confirmed cases in China and over 3,000 cases outside China while about 2/3 of cases in China
was located in Wuhan.1
Zhang et al reported the largest epidemiological investigation of 72314 cases and showed the
crude case fatality rate in Hubei province (2.9%) was 7.3 times higher than other provinces (0.4%) in
China,2 which indicated that there are differences in clinical outcome between the patients in Hubei and
other provinces. The features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan have been described
in detail in several studies. Currently, there has been limited studies about patients with COVID-19 in

Zhejiang and Beijing, which is far from Hubei.3,4 However, the clinical characteristics and progression
of disease outside Hubei, especially in areas near Hubei which have a relative higher risk of importing
patients than remote areas, were still unknown.
Hunan is adjacent to Hubei province, and the well-developed transportation system between
Hunan and Hubei provided a high possibility for disease transmission in the early stage of COVID-19
outbreak when measures like city lockdown and traffic restriction were not taken. Therefore, studies in
areas near Hubei can provide more information about the clinical characteristics of COVILD-19 and
experience of diagnosis and treatment which can be referenced by areas outside Wuhan and countries
worldwide under the current epidemic of COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
epidemic history and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan, China.

Methods

2.1 Study design and subjects
From January 23 to February 14, 2020, all consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to
the first Hospital of Changsha and Loudi Central Hospital in Hunan, China were recruited. The first
Hospital of Changsha and Loudi Central Hospital are two of the major tertiary hospitals and are
responsible for the treatments for patients with COVID-19 assigned by the Chinese government.
Diagnostic criteria and clinical classification of all confirmed COVID-19 cases were based on
guidelines of National Health Commission.5 Data collection and analysis of cases and close contacts
were determined by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) to be
part of a continuing public health outbreak investigation and were thus considered exempt from

institutional review board approval. Oral consent was obtained from all patients.

2.2 Data collection
Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, therapy and outcome data were extracted
from electronic medical records. Clinical outcomes (discharges, mortality, length of stay) were
followed up to February 20, 2020. The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the symptoms
were noticed by patients.

2.3 Laboratory confirmation
Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by two different institutions of Changsha or
Loudi city simultaneously: the municipal Center for designated isolation hospitals and Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC). RT-PCR detection reagents were provided by the two institutions. Throat swab
specimens obtained from all patients at admission, were maintained in viral transport medium. SARSCoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR using the same protocol described previously.6 To evaluate the
overall lung involvement in CT imaging, each lung was divided into three lung zones, and each lung
zone was assigned a score according to the percent of involvement.7

2.4 Clinical classification
Clinical classification was carried out with following standards:5 1. mild type: mild clinical symptoms
without pneumonia in chest imaging performance; 2. moderate type: fever, respiratory tract and other
symptoms with pneumonia in imaging performance; 3. severe type: any one condition of the
followings: (1) respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥ 30 times/min; (2) fingertip oxygen saturation ≤

93% in resting state; (3) arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired oxygen ≤300 mmHg; 4.
critical type: any one condition of the followings: (1) respiratory failure need mechanical ventilation;
(2) shock; (3) other organs failure need intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring and treatment.

2.5 Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were described as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Categorical variables
were summarized as counts and percentages. We categorized those four clinical types to three groups as
mild group, moderate group and severe/critical group for further statistical analysis. Differences
observed among all the three groups were analyzed by Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for
categorical data, one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test for quantitative data, as
appropriate. Two-tailed p < 0.05 was thought as having significantly difference between three groups.
For further pairwise comparisons, the significance level was adjusted using the Bonferroni method. All
data were analyzed by SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Kaplan-Meier curve was
constructed by the survival and survminer package in R, version 3.6.0 (http://www.r-project.org/).

Results

3.1 Epidemiological and baseline characteristics of patients
291 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study.
Epidemiological and baseline characteristics of patients in detail were shown in Table 1. For all the 291
patients, the median age was 46.0 years (IQR, 34.0 - 59.0 years; range, 1.0 - 84.0 years). Half patients
(156, 53,6%) aged between 15 - 49 years, and 11 (3.8%) patients were aged below 15 years. 145

(49.8%) patients were male. 252 (86.6%) patients had a history of exposure to source of transmission
within 14 days before symptoms onset. 114 (39.2%) patients were associated with familial clusters. 93
(32.0%) patients had at least one underlying disease including hypertension (13.4%), diabetes (7.6%),
chronic liver disease (5.2%), cardiovascular disease (4.1%), chronic respiratory disease (3.4%), etc.
The most common symptoms including fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%) and fatigue (31.6%). The
median time from disease onset to first admission was 5 days (IQR: 3-8). None of the patients were
medical staff. At admission, 245 (83.2%) patients had normal temperature (under 37.5℃), and the
median highest body temperature during hospitalization was 38.0℃ (37.2℃, 38.5℃).
After admission, 291 patients were categorized into mild group (29, 10.0%), moderate group (212,
72.8%) and severe/critical group (50, 17.2%) respectively. The age distribution was different among
three groups (P<0.001). Patients in severe/critical group were older compared with the mild group
(60.5 vs 50.0, p=0.001) or moderate group (60.5 vs 41.0, p<0.001). There was no difference in gender
among three groups. Interestingly, as for the exposure history, the proportion of patients that had been
to Wuhan in severe/critical group (17.2% vs 48.0%, p=0.006) and moderate group (17.2% vs 43.4%,
p=0.007) were higher than that of mild group. Similar results were found in the history of any kinds of
exposure to source of transmission. For coexisting conditions at admission, the proportion of patients
with hypertension in the severe/critical group were higher than mild group (30.8% vs 10.3%, p=0.008)
and moderate group (30.8% vs 8.0%, p=0.000). The result was also similar for chronic respiratory
disease. A higher proportion of patients in severe/critical group had symptoms like fever, dyspnea and
fatigue, while other symptoms like nausea or vomiting were more common in mild group.

All patients received imaging examination including chest radiography or computed tomography (CT)
on admission. Typical manifestations in CT and chest X-ray plain film on admission were bilateral and
unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation (Figure 1). Among all patients, 115 patients performed
CT within one week after admission, which showed the medium score of lung involvement in both the
whole lung field and each separate lung field (upper, middle, lower) in severe/critical group was higher
than moderate group (all p < 0.01).
Laboratory examinations data were given in Table 2. On admission, 36.1% or 22.7% patients
showed leukopenia (white blood cell count < 4.00*109/L) or lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <
0.8*109/L) respectively. Neutrophils in 54 (18.6%) patients were below the normal range.
Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150*109/L) were observed in 31.3% patients. Interestingly, 50.2%
patients had eosinophils count lower than 0.02*109/L, and the situation was obviously worse in
severe/critical group whose medium eosinophils count was 0.00*109/L. Compared with mild or
moderate group, severe/critical group had a higher level of neutrophil and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte
Ratio, and a lower level of lymphocytes, eosinophils and platelets (all p<0.01).
Biochemistry tests showed 83.5% patients had an increased level of D-dimer and the level was
higher in severe/critical group than in mild group (0.39 vs 0.20, p=0.000) and moderate group (0.39 vs
0.24, p=0.002). The coagulation function test showed an increase of fibrinogen in 45 of 58 (77.6%)
patients with available results. For liver function test, severe/critical group had a higher proportion of
elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than mild group (32.0% vs 17.2%, p<0.001). No obvious
abnormality of renal function was found in patients without any history of kidney disease. 10.3%
patients had hyponatremia and the proportion were higher in severe/critical group than in mild group
(22.0% vs 6.9%, p=0.005). Moreover, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high-sensitivity C-

reactive protein (h-CRP) were increased in more than 50% of patients. Decreased level of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) was detected in 51.9% patients. Compared with mild or moderate group,
severe/critical group had a higher level of h-CRP, ESR, creatine kinase, creatine kinase–MB, lactate
dehydrogenase, and lower level of sodium and HDL (all p<0.01). In patients with available
Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test, 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%)
patients had positive antibody test results respectively.

3.3 Treatment and prognosis
285 (97.9%) of 291 patients received antiviral therapy (Table 3), including lopinavir and ritonavir
tablets (75.9%), recombinant human interferon α2b (45.4%), recombinant cytokine gene derived
protein (18.9%) and arbidol hydrochloride capsules (17.2%). 281 (96.6%) patients were treated with
Chinese Medicine. The dose and method of administration was based on the guidelines5.
Patients were discharged from hospital when the symptoms relieved, chest imaging improved, fever
abated for at least three days, and two samples taken from respiratory tract 1 day apart were negative
for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Until February 20, 2020, 159(54.6%) of all patients had been discharged. The
length of hospitalization ranged from 5 to 25 days in discharged patients. We used a Kaplan-Meier plot
to analyze the length of hospitalization for all 291 patients (Figure 2), which shows a median length of
16 days (IQR 14-17). 2 of 291 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization, both of whom had an
exposure history of having been to Wuhan within 14 days prior to onset of illness.

4. Discussion
In this double-center observational study, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of 291 COVID-19

patients in Hunan province were collected and analyzed. Hunan is adjacent to Hubei province, and its
provincial capital Changsha is 294 kilometers away from Wuhan, while another city Loudi is about 392
kilometers away from Wuhan. Given the migrant data in previous years and the lockdown of Wuhan on
Janurary 23, 2020, Changsha is a city with a high estimated number of imported cases.8 Our study
attempted to provide some experience of diagnosis and treatment for the health workers in other areas.
To further show the characteristics in patients with different disease severity, we categorized the 291
patients into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%) for
statistical analysis.
Current studies have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 as a new branch of the β-coronavirus.9 Similar to
other β-coronavirus like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has shown person-to-person transmission ability since its
outbreak in December 8, 2019. The basic reproductive number (R0 3.77) of the COVID-19 estimated
by several epidemic prediction models seems to be higher than SARS.10-12 After the fast increase in the
number of patients in Wuhan during the middle of January, COVID-19 spread to the other provinces
rapidly such as neighbor province Hunan because of the nearby location, developed traffic and large
migrant population.11 In our study, none of 291 patients had a history of direct exposure to Huanan
seafood market, but most patients (86.6%) had an indirect exposure history within 14 days before
symptoms onset, including being to Wuhan (41.6%), having contact with people came from Wuhan
(14.1%) and having contact with local diagnosed patients (38.5%). Our study also showed the
proportion of patients who had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0%) and moderate group
(43.4%) were higher than mild group (17.2%). Besides, both the two death cases in our study had a
travel history in Wuhan while they both used to be in good health. These showed the infectivity and

transmission intensity of the virus, especially in the first or second generation of transmission, and may
indicate that the virulence of the virus will decrease after limited generations of transmission.10,12
Therefore doctors in areas outside Wuhan should be more cautious in clinical decision making when
the patient have a recent history of exposure in Wuhan, including Wuhan residents and those who
recently traveled to Wuhan before disease onset. The proportion of family clusters infection in our
study was 39.2% which was lower than other studies.3 Besides, none of our patient was medical staff
while 1080 medical staff were infected in Wuhan until February 11, 2020.2
For demographic and clinical characteristics, 53.6% patients aged between 15-49 years, followed
by the 50-64 years age group (27.5%). In severe/critical group, 32.0% and 40.0% patients aged from 50
to 64 and over 64 respectively, consistent with report of Guan et al.13 Female and male patients both
accounted for half in all three groups. The median time from disease onset to first admission in our
study was 5.0 days. Similar to the recent publications,13-16 our data also showed that fever, cough and
fatigue were the most common symptoms. The severe/critical group patients were more likely to have
two or more symptoms at admission. While most symptoms were more frequently seen in
severe/critical group, nausea or vomiting were more common in mild group, which may indicate
different body responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with different health state and immune
system defensive characteristics. 58.0% patients in severe/critical group had at least one underlying
disease. In concert with the study of Guan et al,13 Bases on these findings, we suggest clinicians pay
more attention to and closely observe patients with multiple symptoms and underlying diseases to
prevent disease deterioration.
For laboratory inspection, blood routine test showed 36.1% and 22.7% of patients had leukopenia
and lymphopenia respectively. Interestingly, eosinopenia was detected in more than 50% patients,

especially in the severe/critical group (74%), which was not emphasized in previous studies.17 This
indicate that eosinophils could assist in the diagnosis and severity assessment of COVID-19.
Inconsistent with the other research10, elevated D-dimer was observed in majority of patients (83.5%)
in our study, and its level was significantly higher in severe/critical group. Consistent with the research
of Guan,13 Myocardial damage and elevated liver enzyme were not common and mainly happened in
severe/critical group. Besides, Obvious disorder of renal function and electrolyte were relatively rare in
our patients. 77.6% patients with available coagulation function test result had elevated fibrinogen on
admission, and the proportion in severe/critical group was even higher, which have not been observed
in other studies. In the early stages of SARS patients, researchers also found an increase in
fibrinogen.18 Previous studies had shown that SARS-CoV 3a protein can up regulate the expression of
fibrinogen in lung epithelial cells.19 We speculate in the lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 or
the secondary systemic inflammation, the activated body stress system may lead to the increase of
fibrinogen. Another interesting phenomenon was that considerable proportion of patients had positive
results in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody tests, which indicate
Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia co-infection, which was higher than other research.
Previous report indicated that Mycoplasma fermentans enhanced the cytotoxicity against Vero E6 cells
infected with SARS-CoV.20 This indicate COVID-19 patients co-infected with the two types of
pathogens may lead to more severe state, thus clinicians need pay attention to the screening of these
two pathogens in these patients.
Compared with the patient confirmed as COVID-19 in Wuhan14-16, our study showed that patients
in Hunan had relatively higher discharge rate and lower mortality. In our study, 82.8% patients were
prone to a mild or moderate type and 54.6% patients were discharged at the end of follow-up. The

length of stay in hospital ranged from 5 to 25 days in discharged patients. 2 of 291 (0.7%) patients died
during hospitalization. One death case was a 64 years old man in moderate group without any
underlying disease. He had a fever for 3 days before admission and was treated by antiviral therapy
including lopinavir and ritonavir tablets. The other death case was a 58 years old man in severe/critical
group also without any underlying disease, but had symptoms of fever, cough, dyspnea and fatigue for
7 days before admission. Laboratory tests detected a decreased level of WBC (2.26*109/L), lymphocyte
(0.40*109/L) and eosinophils (0.00*109/L), and elevated level of ALT (48.5U/L) and AST (82.1U/L) in
this patient. Pulmonary CT of both patients showed progressive patchy consolidation of bilateral lobes.
Although there has been a lack of evidence-based specific antiviral drugs, almost all patients in this
study received antiviral therapy (96.6%), lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (75.9%), recombinant human
interferon α2b (45.4%) were the most commonly used treatment. Besides, chloroquine phosphate was
reported to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 in a multicenter clinical
trials21 and had just been included in the latest edition of the guidelines for China. According to this
guideline, two patients in the study were given chloroquine for antiviral therapy. However, the safety
and efficacy of antiviral therapies used in COVID-19 patients need further studied.
Our study provided more information about epidemiology and clinical profiles of COVID-19 in
adjacent area around Hubei Province. It is hoped that our study may provide the basis for the
epidemiology related measures of patients in covid-19 import area as well as for clinicians to make
medical decisions.
There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, due to the limitations of the retrospective study,
laboratory examinations were performed according tothe clinical care needs of the patient, thus some
patients’ laboratory exam results were incomlpeted. Secondly, given the short observation period,

nearly half of our patients were still receiving treatment in hospital at the end of our follow-up and we
could not decide the mortality and prognosis of the whole case series. Moreover, it is difficult to
distinguish the specific efficacy of one single drug as various treatment were applied simultaneously,
and the guideline about diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 were updated frequently. Therefore, the
treatment experience in our study should be carefully thought when treating patients in different places
and circumstances, and further researches are needed to verify the the safety and efficacy.

5. Conclusion
In this double-center observational study of 291 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in
Hunan, a province adjacent to Hubei, 86.6% patients had indirect exposure history. The proportion of
patients who had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild
group. Clinical characteristics of patients in this study were different from patients in Wuhan.
