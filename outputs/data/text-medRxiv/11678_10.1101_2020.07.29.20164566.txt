Summary
Background The world is experiencing local/regional hot-spots and spikes of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19 disease. We aimed
to formulate an applicable epidemiological model to accurately predict and forecast the
impact of local outbreaks of COVID-19 to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity,
policy making, and public health decisions.

Methods The model utilised the aggregated daily COVID-19 situation reports (including counts
of daily admissions, discharges, and bed occupancy) from the local NHS hospitals and COVID19 related weekly deaths in hospitals and other settings in Sussex (population 1·7M),
Southeast England. These datasets corresponded to the first wave of COVID-19 infections
from 24 March to 15 June 2020. A novel epidemiological predictive and forecasting model was
then derived based on the local/regional surveillance data. Through a rigorous inverse
parameter inference approach, the model parameters were estimated by fitting the model to
the data in an optimal sense and then subsequently validated.

Results The inferred parameters were physically reasonable and matched up to the widely
used parameter values derived from the national datasets.28 We validate the predictive power
of our model by using a subset of the available data and compare the model predictions for
the next 10, 20, and 30 days. The model exhibits a high accuracy in the prediction, even when
using only as few as 20 data points for the fitting.

Conclusions We have demonstrated that by using local/regional data, our predictive and
forecasting model can be utilised to guide the local healthcare demand and capacity, policy
making, and public health decisions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the local
population. Understanding how future COVID-19 spikes/waves could possibly affect the
regional populations empowers us to ensure the timely commissioning and organisation of
services. The flexibility of timings in the model, in combination with other early warning
systems, produces a timeframe for these services to prepare and isolate capacity for likely and
potential demand within regional hospitals. The model also allows local authorities to plan
potential mortuary capacity and understand the burden on crematoria and burial services.
The model algorithms have been integrated into a web-based multi-institutional toolkit, which
can be used by NHS hospitals, local authorities, and public health departments in other regions
of the UK and elsewhere. The parameters, which are locally informed, form the basis of
predicting and forecasting exercises accounting for different scenarios and impact of COVID19 transmission.

Introduction
Since SARS-CoV-2 was identified in December 2019,1 COVID-19 has swiftly and rapidly spread
to nearly all countries in the world, becoming an ongoing global world pandemic that has
required unprecedented international, national, and regional interventions to try and contain
its spread.1,2 Unlike the 1918-19 H1N1 pandemic, which is considered one of the greatest
medical disasters of the 20th century,1 the spread of COVID-19 has unfolded live on
multimedia platforms with real-time updates, statistics and with remarkable reporting

accuracy,3 and yet reliable, accurate, and data-validated epidemiological modelling with
forecasting and prediction capabilities remains largely out of reach.1,4–8 Given the lack of
widely accessible pharmaceutical interventions, such as vaccination and antiviral drugs,
epidemiological modelling has been thrust to the forefront of world organisations’ and
governments’ responses, rapid decision-making, and public health interventions and
policy.1,4,9–11 Until these pharmaceutical interventions become widely available, the only
measures for infection prevention and control are self or group-isolation (quarantine), testing
and contact tracing, physical distancing, decontamination, use of personal protective
equipment, wearing masks and hygiene measures. A lot of these unprecedented
actions/decisions have resulted in complete lockdowns of countries and economies, and yet
these decisions are based on qualitative/quantitative predictions/models using national
datasets outside the countries imposing the lockdowns on the basis of these models. A fair
criticism of the underlying approach has been the lack of rigorous model validation and
applicability given the datasets available at the time of the study, the lack of risk assessment
associated with the decisions and their impact on the healthcare demand, capacity, and
delivery and subsequently the lack of precision forecasting that is driven by data.8,12
Unfortunately, early epidemiological models needed to make assumptions out of necessity
about parameters and disease progression. Therefore, given the lack of data at the early
stages of the pandemic, the predictions of these models were near impossible to
validate.1,4,6,7,9 At the forefront of these epidemiological models that have played a pivotal
role in guiding national public health policy and healthcare responses that include the current
social distancing, contact tracing, and quarantine measures, is the well documented Imperial
College London model.1 The societal and economic impact of the aforementioned decisions
have hardly been quantified, only estimates in the range of trillions of dollars loss to the world

economy are reported.13,14 A few models dealing with decision-making within the COVID-19
crisis have been reported;9,15,16 however, these lack the power of model prediction and
forecasting based on appropriate variables and datasets.
In order to understand the temporal dynamics of COVID-19, a lot of modelling work has
been undertaken, focusing primarily on national datasets from China, Italy, Spain, UK, and the
USA.1,4,6,7,9,17–20 Given the inhomogeneous nature of such datasets, accurate predictions and
forecasting of the spread of COVID-19 is challenging.8,21 Where such predictions were made,
caveats accompanied these predictions simply because of the lack of rigorous mathematical
and statistical validation of the models and the lack of robust data on which mathematical
assumptions are based.1,4,6–9,19,20 Forecasting requires ample historical information/datasets,
which were lacking during the first wave of COVID-19. Current state-of-the-art forecasting
models are based, on the one hand, on time series analysis without an underlying dynamic
epidemiological model.6,8,22,23 On the other hand, where forecasting is based on
epidemiological models,6,24 these lack rigorous validation, sensitivity analysis, and analysis
with respect to identifiability of parameters and therefore have limited forecasting power. An
interesting approach is proposed in Bertozzi et al. (2020)4 where three models were presented
depending on the forecasting timescales; an exponential growth model, a self-exciting
branching process, and the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental
model. The exponential growth model is assumed valid at the early stages of the pandemic,
the self-exciting branching process models the individual count data going into the
development of the pandemic, and the SIR is a macroscopic mean-field model that describes
the pandemic dynamics as it approaches the peak of the infection and disease. Another
interesting and alternative approach is to build machine learning and artificial intelligence
techniques on top of epidemiological models to allow for model predictions and forecasting.6

This approach, so far, has been applied to national datasets from the USA but no regional
modelling of this type has been undertaken.
The use of local datasets is critical for managing and mitigating COVID-19 secondary
spikes/waves and re-infection within local communities.25 Already there is ample evidence
that local forecasting models could help local/regional authorities to plan lockdowns,
restrictions, opening of schools/universities, as well as planning for healthcare demand and
capacity. For example, during the summer of 2020 all the 50 states in the USA started to relax
lockdown restrictions, however, several states soon after either put on hold their efforts to
open fully or started to backtrack due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and the start
of secondary waves.8 At the same time in the UK, cities such as Leicester, Bradford, and
Oldham were in the midst of experiencing secondary COVID-19 waves and re-infection.
Similarly, in Australia, the city of Melbourne in the state of Victoria was in stage 4 lockdown
while the remainder of the state was in stage 3 lockdown.10,11 During the first wave, Australia
was hailed as a global success story in suppressing the spread of COVID-19 and even at the
height of the initial outbreak, it only reported a little over 600 infections a day. A similar story
emerged in Spain with regions in Catalonia undergoing secondary lockdowns. The usefulness
of national models, in all these countries, is not clear in terms of being able to predict and
forecast the emergence of such spikes, waves or new incidences locally until they have already
taken place, which is too late. We propose therefore an alternative quantitative predictive
approach which gives local (and national) authorities the ability to predict and forecast COVID19 scenarios based on their current historical datasets to visualise future dynamic temporal
trends of the infection/disease progression for healthcare planning purposes.
In this study, we want to demonstrate the usefulness and utility of a locally data-driven
epidemiological model, based on recent datasets from the three adjoining regions in Sussex,

Southeast England (i.e. Brighton and Hove City Council, East and West Sussex County
Councils), to make predictions and forecast to guide local/regional decision-making and
healthcare delivery. The approach is based on a modified SIR-type model, (Figure 1), that has
been formulated to reflect the dynamics of the combined Sussex populations of
approximately 1·7 million and the mathematical interpretation of the data available.
The aim of our study is to propose a systematic modelling approach that addresses
healthcare demand and capacity at a local level, using the Sussex datasets, by conducting
healthcare demand modelling that naturally leads to a standardised framework to quantify
demand generated as a result of COVID-19. This framework will facilitate short-term
predictions and long-term scenario forecasting, allowing for investigations into the impact of
COVID-19 on healthcare provision and planning within the local area and to mitigate longterm changes in local hospital demand as a result of further COVID-19 secondary waves. We
used the local datasets collected throughout the first wave, which included local daily hospital
data and weekly deaths data. Our approach differs substantially from current state-of-the-art
modelling-forecasting approaches where unknown parameters driving epidemiological
models have been based on various assumptions which vary substantially from one model to
the other as well as variations between the domain-expertise of the researchers involved in
making those assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work where the full SEIRD model is solved and fitted to data by using only the few compartments for which data is
available. This is the novelty of our approach. We impose no a priori assumptions on the values
of the model parameters; instead we infer these through an inverse modelling approach by
requiring the model to fit to local data in an optimal sense. From the full SEIR-D model, we
derive the “observational model”, which is a representation of the full SEIR-D model described
only in terms of the model parameters and compartments that are captured by the

mathematical interpretation of data, in this case the observed quantities are: hospital
admissions, bed occupancy, discharges, and COVID-19 related deaths (see details in the
Supplementary material). In this way, by fitting the observational model to data, we obtain
optimally defined values of the unknown model parameters (all the parameters shown in
Figure 1), accurate to some degree of confidence.26,27

Methods
Data Collection
As part of the national COVID response, all the National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in
England, treating COVID-19 patients, submitted a Daily Situation Report to NHS England
(NHSE). The regional data for Sussex hospitals were then sent to the Sussex Clinical
Commissioning Group (CCG) who aggregated the data and combined it with the death
registrations (with COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death) from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). The subsets of the hospital datasets included daily admissions, discharges,
and bed occupancy. The death dataset consisted of weekly COVID-19 related deaths in
hospitals and community settings (e.g. nursing homes). These datasets corresponded to the
first wave of infections from 24th March until 15th June 2020. For the regional population
count, the ONS Mid-Year Estimates (MYE) for 2018 were used. By identifying the
compartments where data were available, a mathematical model was generated with the
objective of forecasting local hospital demand and capacity and mortuary requirements. To
mitigate changes in policy of what constituted a COVID-19 death and the procedure for
recording patients with COVID-19, we account for significant levels of error n the observations.
This entails that we do not explicitly distinguish between model and observational errors, but
rather we compare the observations with the model solution and consider the difference to

be the overall error. In particular, we are including in the error the variation due to the
stochastic nature of the epidemics, since the model accounts only for the mean quantities.
Although death is an absolute count, the policy regarding what constituted a COVID-19 related
death changed frequently throughout the lead up to and during the lockdown period.
Similarly, testing was not optimal when the hospital data collection started and so admissions
and occupancy counts were retroactively edited to incorporate newly tested patients, thus
the balance of total patients between days may not match up. We note that, as detailed
below, our model was designed specifically to avoid the use of general testing data. In this
way, we avoid dealing with the correlation between detected cases and the number of tests.
The number of cases in hospitals are recorded in a systematic way in order to properly isolate
the patients to avoid outbreaks and, are therefore, less dependent on the overall number of
tests. In a similar manner, it is well documented that age plays an important role in the severity
of a COVID-19 infection;1,7,28,29 however, at the beginning of the epidemic within the UK, the
appropriate age-structured data simply did not exist.

Data-driven SEIR-D modelling
The temporal dynamics of the compartmentalised epidemiological model are depicted in
Figure 1, following classical approaches for formulating SIR models.2,30 The mathematical
interpretation of the schematic diagram in Figure 1 leads to a temporal epidemiological
dynamical system modelled by a system of ordinary differential equations supported by nonnegative initial conditions. The full model is summarised in equations (1) – (9) in the
Supplementary material.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of the compartmental model. The susceptible population S(t) becomes infected
through contacts with infectious individuals, U(t) and I(t). Infected individuals incubate the disease first,6 and are not
infectious in this state, denoted by E(t), and after an incubation time, they become infectious. The compartment U(t)
accounts for individuals that are not hospitalised; we only observe tem if they die, but not if they recover. Many models
have split the U(t) compartment into two separate compartments (see for example Blyuss et al. (2020)2), one to describe
individuals who are asymptomatic and the other to describe individuals who have symptoms but do not require
hospitalisation. However, this approach is constrained by the lack of reliable datasets, and therefore, models of this nature
rely purely on the merits of the simulations with no forecasting capabilities. For such models, it is challenging to obtain
reliable data on those who are asymptomatic, especially on the scale of multiple regions/counties. Individuals in the
compartment I(t) are eventually hospitalised and move to compartment H(t). We added the hospital compartment H(t)
into the model as a transition compartment due to the data we have access to. There are two possible outcomes for COVID19 infections, recovery or death, denoted by R or D respectively, each subscripted with the severity of the infection. We
note that there is also a difficulty gaining reliable data that considers those who are not hospitalised and recover. However,
we have reliable datasets for those who die outside of hospital and thus, in the spirit of this model, are related to the not
hospitalised pathway. Coloured and dashed arrows or compartments indicate that data are available: admissions to
hospital (red dashed arrow from I(t) to H(t)), discharges from hospital (red dashed arrow from H(t) to RH(t)), daily counts
of cases in hospital (red dashed H(t) compartment), and independent weekly data on deaths, both in hospital (red dashed
arrow from H(t) to DH(t)), and out of the hospital settings (red dashed arrow from U(t) to DU(t)). A novel feature of our
model and inference method is that even though information about U(t) is hard to come by, we can still obtain information
by using the red dashed arrow between U(t) to DU(t). The same thing can be said for obtaining the information on I(t), by
using the red dashed arrow between I(t) to H(t). The parameters in the model regulate the rates from one compartment
to the next and are described in Table 1. All parameters are inferred from the data using a minimisation process under
constraints on the total population and the effective reproduction number.

Our model follows the general principles of SIR modelling approaches with one clear
difference in that this model system is data-driven formulated where we have highlighted in
dashed colour those compartments or pathways in Figure 1 where data is available within our
local area. The physical justification of the SEIR-D model above is well-grounded in the
modelling literature for COVID-19 and the general theory of epidemiology.2,30

Inferring model parameters given hospital datasets
From the schematic diagram shown in Figure 1, we are interested in finding the optimal set of
eight model parameters: b, gE, p, gU, gI, gH, mU, and µH, such that the SEIR-D model best-fits the
observed data. We estimate the parameters in the model in two steps. First, we exploit the
linear relationship, arising from the mathematical model, between mortality in hospitals and
discharged patients, depicted by the blue double dashed line and the red dashed line between
H(t) and RH(t) in Figure 1, respectively, to fit the parameter h = µH gH-1. The second step is to
infer the remaining parameters by expressing the model in terms of the mathematical
interpretation using the model parameters and compartments of the available data; we call
this the observational model. Once the observational model is found, we find the maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) corresponding to the negative log-likelihood described in the
Supplementary material, by means of the minimisation algorithm L-BFGS-B.31,32 In both cases,
we explore the relationship between model parameters where we have access to reliable
datasets to mitigate parameter identifiability issues.33–35 Details of the linear relationship of
discharges and deaths in hospital and the observational model are given in the Supplementary
material. We note that this two-step fitting approach is not valid in general, but the structure
of the model and the data allow us to do so for this particular case, since the parameter
optimized in the first step is not present in the second step. In fact, one could perform the
fitting in only one step to obtain the same result. The advantage of doing the fitting in two
steps is that, in the first step, we can use more appropriate techniques for the linear
regression.

Forecasting and validation

As outlined above, models of this nature often lack parameter validation and thus lack the
ability to predict relatively far into the future.8,9 To validate the predictive power of our
modified SEIR-D model (Figure 1), we used the previously outlined inference algorithm to
obtain new estimates for the model parameters using only a limited number of data points,
and focused on predicting the hospital admissions, discharges, and bed occupancy using a
minimum of 12 and a maximum of 51 data points. This is due to the larger hospital dataset we
possess, since it is recorded daily rather than recorded weekly. We evaluated the predictive
power of a parameter set by performing a prediction for the next 10, 20 and 30 days, starting
the day after the last data point used for the parameter estimation. By comparing the
prediction with the available data, we computed the percentage of days that are correctly
predicted. It was considered that a day is correctly predicted if it lies within a given tolerance
of standard deviations from the available data. This approach quantifies the risk associated
with the decision of selecting a certain number of days into the future, e.g. 10, 20 and 30 days.
It is important to note that this approach relies on the interpretation of the data, that the data
is being collected in a consistent manner, and no policy changes happen within the period of
the dataset, which would incur a change in public behaviour.

Results
Parameter values
Using the compartmental model along with the novel inference algorithms, we derived the
parameter values summarised in Table 1. Figure 2 shows the daily number of patients
admitted to hospital, those in hospital and those who were discharged, respectively. To
demonstrate the accuracy of the fitting procedure, we super-impose the observed datasets
and their continuum mathematical counterparts as well as their 95% confidence intervals

(95%CI) for these curves. It can be easily verified that the fitting captures the trends of the
data and fits the majority of the data within the 95% CIs. Moreover, small perturbations in
most parameters result in small changes to the overall fit of the data, whilst others result in
quite a large change in the overall fit (See Supplementary material for details). This reflects
how well-characterised a parameter is from the data, rather than sensitivity of the model,
since the forecasting pattern is not changing significantly. Accounting for the error in the loglikelihood and the prediction technique, as well as the other sensitivity tests, demonstrates
the robustness of the model when the actual data are perturbed and fitted. It is noteworthy
that our set of optimal inferred parameters give a value of effective reproduction number Rt
= 0·69 throughout the lockdown.

the counting protocol has not changed during the period. There are between 1 and 5 outliers in each data set, out of a

different definitions for the incubation period, for instance time from exposure to onset of symptoms instead of time from
exposure to transmissibility. This therefore has a knock-on effect on the understanding of the average infectious period.
*The infected fatality ratio (IFR) in Ferguson et al. (2020)1 includes all cases, whilst in our model, it is limited to non-hospital
infections but is heavily influenced by mortality in care-homes. **In Lourenço et al. (2020)20, the IFR is limited to severe
infections.

Predictive power of the SEIR-D model
Using the predictive power method outlined above corresponds to a total of 1776 parameters
sets. The resulting values of the parameters from the inference algorithm using the subsets of
data are similar to the global fit using all the available data. Figure 3 shows the results for
predictions 10, 20 and 30 days into the future. To our knowledge, this is the first result of its
kind that validates the forecasting in this manner.

Figure 3: Validation of the predictive power of the model. We fitted the parameter models using all possible sequences of
consecutive admissions, discharge and bed occupancy data points, from 12 to 51 points. Note that since there are only 82
data points available, we could not use more than 51 points to validate a prediction for 30 days, otherwise we will not
have data to compare with. The predictive power is quantified as the number of days predicted within an accuracy of one,
two, or three standard deviations of the data. There are significant differences in the predictive power for different
variables. Admissions and discharges can be predicted accurately using as low as 15 data points to fit the model, whilst
hospital bed occupancy requires about 30 data points to reach the same accuracy levels. Admissions/discharges and bed
occupancy are different in nature: the former are rates (individuals per day), whilst the latter is an absolute count - this
might explain the difference in the predictive power. In addition, bed occupancy is roughly ten times the value of
admissions and discharges.

Discussion
Predicting the local/regional resurgence of COVID-19 is the number one priority of
governments and local authorities in the UK and around the world, to control and halt the
local and national transmission of infection. The pandemic itself has thrown to the forefront
of science the role and utility of epidemiological modelling at a time when questions of
urgency, national importance, and uncertainty simultaneously come into play, thereby
exposing its current limitations in terms of predictions and forecasting.8,12 A comment by
Saltelli et al. (2020)12 outlines a manifesto highlighting five ways in which mathematical
models should serve society. These include minding the assumptions (the minimal the better),
being mindful of model complexities (hubris – balancing the usefulness of the model with the

breath of its predictions), being mindful of the interests of the researchers (techniques and
methodology can be limited in scope to the expertise of the researchers), being aware of the
consequences (mitigate the uncertainty), and finally being mindful of the unknowns
(communicating what is unknown is as important as communicating what is known). Our
approach is based on these five pillars to ensure that our research outcomes are engrained
and driven by reliable local surveillance data with minimal assumptions and an explicit simple
data-formulated model. Predictive epidemiological modelling applied to local data has the
unique ability to offer local authorities a framework for decision-making that is based on
temporal trends of these local datasets. Modelling lessons learnt at the local level can possibly
be transferred to the national arena to help guide data acquisition such that datasets are
amenable to model-data prediction approaches as well as providing avenues for short-,
medium-, and long-term forecasting.
During the early stages of COVID-19, parallels between COVID-19 and the Spanish flu
(among other influenza diseases) that killed more than 50 million people with an average age
of 28 years, were drawn.1,4,6,22,38 As a result, to mitigate and prepare for COVID-19
hospitalisations and deaths, national governments and hospitals suspended or postponed
important critical diagnostic procedures/treatments, such as cancer diagnosis and treatment.
Recent studies have highlighted how predictions need to be transparent and humble in order
to instill confidence and invite insight and not blame.12 For a disease such as COVID-19,
espoused wrong predictions can have a devastating effect on billions of people around the
world in terms of the economy, job-security, health, education, and societal turmoil, just to
mention a few. In this report, we have demonstrated that our inference process and resulting
parameters allow us to produce forecasts for up to 30 days into the future to a high accuracy,
for quantities of interest such as hospital bed occupancy, where such a time period can ensure

that decisions, and changes in decisions, can be enacted. The underlying temporal dynamics
fit the pattern of an infectious disease outbreak and does not rely solely on statistically
inferred parameters,8 in the absence of a dynamic model. Such statistical models lack the
ability for long-term forecasting. A recent review by Jewell et al. (2020)39 established the need
for accurate forecasting in the timescales we have demonstrated to help ease public
uncertainty and anxiety by aiding local policy planning in the exact manner we are using the
presented results in our collaborations with the Sussex local authorities and public health
departments.
It is clear from the literature that the accuracy of predictions and forecasting is closely
correlated with the underlying theoretical assumptions and the use of pre-determined values
of the parameters that are extracted from studies in different contexts, for instance for
populations with different demographics.8,12 This, in turn, is driven by the lack of reliable
datasets appropriate for model-data validation and sensitivity analysis. In this study, we have
proposed a bottom-up approach where a model built on local datasets has the ability to guide
local decision-making in terms of healthcare demand and capacity, in particular given the
surge in COVID-19 secondary spikes/waves.10,11 Other widely used publications, such as
Ferguson et al. (2020)1, used datasets mainly from Wuhan and other national datasets for
similar infectious diseases which means that overall policy and data collection will, in general,
differ to the current situation. The important highlight and applicability of our work is that we
used local datasets for our modelling, and so we fully understand how the data were collected
and know exactly the physical interpretation of the parameters, something that cannot be
claimed by using the parameters found in the other publications of predictive modelling.8,39
The SEIR-D model itself is simple and transparent. Moreover, we have designed our approach
in such a way that this method can be used by other regions/counties across the UK provided

they have the required data, and as such, we have created a toolkit which makes our approach
more accessible.40 This allows for users who are not familiar with mathematical modelling to
use our approach and generate their own parameters to inform local policy.
Our modelling framework is not only tailored to deal with COVID-19 but can be applied to
other excess death situations in summer and winter months which are known to kill thousands
of people every year, provided the appropriate datasets exist. Since the framework is built
around an SEIR-D model, introducing vaccinations into the model is not mathematically
difficult provided we have a good understanding of the vaccination program with reliable
datasets.41–44 Similarly, with the emergence of the new COVID-19 variants (UK, South Africa,
Brazil), for example the UK VOC 202012/01 variant that emerged in the Southeast of England
in November 2020, we can adapt the work by Kissler et al. (2020)6 to provide a multi-strain
model whereby an individual either catches one strain or the other.6,45 Understanding the
impact of these will be vitally important in the progression of dealing with the disease,
however it is not clear what data will be readily available, and our observational model will
need to be adapted accordingly.
Epidemic forecasting and the development of early warning systems for healthcare
demand and capacity has been thrown to the forefront of epidemiological modelling. By
working in close collaboration, theoreticians, local authority public health teams, and NHS
planners have a unique opportunity to bring novel approaches to healthcare decision-making
and planning with forecasting capabilities similar to those used for weather forecasting.

Subsequent performance of the model post phase one of the lockdown
We continued to use the model and inference approach in the subsequent months following
the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns. Figure 4 shows the performance of the

model for hospital bed occupancy until the beginning of October 2020. The parameters of the
model were re-fitted twice during the period of March to October to account for policy
changes, such as implementation of lift of lockdowns and other restrictions. In these cases,
the decision to re-fit was based on expert opinion, but in the future we will use model
selection methods to find the optimal refitting times.

Figure 4: Hospital bed occupancy up to the 6th October 2020. The model parameters were fitted for three different
periods of time (24th March to 22nd May, 23rd May to 10th August, 11th August to 6th October) to reflect significant
policy changes. The performance of the model is stable throughout the depicted period.
