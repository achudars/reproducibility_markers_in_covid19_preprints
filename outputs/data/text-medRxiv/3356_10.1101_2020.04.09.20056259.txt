Abstract
Objectives: There is uncertainty about when the first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Spain, as
asymptomatic patients can transmit the virus. We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses
masked early COVID-19 cases and, if so, estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases in a large
database of primary-care records covering >6 million people in Catalonia.
Design: Time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, using all influenza seasons from
autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020.
Setting: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain.
Participants: People registered in one of the contributing primary-care practices, covering >6 million
people and >85% of the population.
Main outcome measures: Weekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 diagnosed in primary care.
Analyses: Daily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the
previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. Epidemic curves were characterised for
the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and
peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model predictions for 2019-2020. ARIMA
models were fitted to the included influenza seasons, overall and stratified by age, to estimate
expected case numbers. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus
expected cases.
Results: Four influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017) were
used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020
and 20 March 20202, 8,017 (95% CI: 1,841 to 14,718) excess influenza cases were identified. This
excess was highest in the 15-64 age group.
Conclusions: COVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first
imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as
influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures
were taken. In future, the surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care
electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like
illness-causing pathogens. Earlier detection would allow public health responses to be initiated earlier
than during the current crisis.

Background
A new infectious disease, now named COVID-19, was identified by Chinese authorities on 7
January 2020 as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan.[1] Caused by SARSCoV-2, COVID-19 is asymptomatic in around 1-3% of patients, according to the WHO
mission report.[2] Most patients present mild influenza-like symptoms, including fever, dry
cough, fatigue, sore throat, dyspnoea, headache, and myalgia.[2,3] Around 20% of
symptomatic cases present severe forms of disease that require hospital admission.[1] Older
people, men, and those with multiple comorbidities appear more likely to suffer more serious
types of COVID-19.[2–6] Conversely, children seem to have a similar probability of infection,
but milder and often asymptomatic forms of the disease.[7]
Cases of COVID-19 have grown exponentially and have been reported all over the world.
The first three cases in Europe were reported in France on 24 January 2020.[8] The first
imported COVID-19 case in Spain was dated 31 January 2020 in La Gomera, and the first in
Catalonia reported a month after, on 25 February 2020. The total number of confirmed cases
in Catalonia then increased exponentially, with 715 cumulative cases reported by 14 March
2020 and a striking 4,203 on 20 March 2020. Despite these official figures, it is uncertain
whether SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the community before the first official cases. It is
difficult to believe, for example, that this airborne infection did not cross the uncontrolled
borders between Catalonia and its northern neighbouring country for a whole month. Some
have thus speculated that undetected COVID-19 cases may have been categorised as
influenza before the first official case was reported in Spain.[9]
Catalonia is fortunate to have a reliable system for influenza surveillance in place. A network
of 60 sentinel general practitioners covering 1% of the total population report daily cases of
influenza-like illness (ILI) and take samples for differential diagnosis and confirmation of
influenza infections in the region.[10] A specialised hospital-based system takes samples
from severe hospitalised flu cases.[10] A community-based surveillance system called
Diagnosticat also extracts counts of ILI diagnoses from a network of GP health records in
real-time, covering 85% of the population.[11] This last approach allows us to examine
trends with granularity and to stratify analyses by age and other factors.
As the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Catalonia during the influenza epidemic
season and the disease shares some symptomatology with influenza, we hypothesised that
SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in the community before the first confirmed case,
resulting in an excess of influenza diagnoses. We aimed to estimate the number of excess
influenza cases in Catalonia, globally and by age, and to examine its relationship with the
number of clinically diagnosed COVID-19 cases.

Methods
We used a time-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases. We extracted data from
primary-care electronic medical records covering about 85% of the population of Catalonia,
around 6 million people. The study period included all influenza seasons from autumn-winter
2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020.
The key study outcomes were diagnoses of influenza and COVID-19. Daily frequency of
influenza cases recorded in primary-care records were obtained from electronic medical
records, as is routinely done for the Diagnosticat database.[12]
Diagnosticat is a website that reports in real-time all influenza diagnoses recorded by all
general practitioners working at any of the primary-care centres run by the Institut Català de
la Salut (ICS). ICS is the main primary-care health service provider in Catalonia and covers
about 85% of practices in the region, who all use the same electronic medical record
software, ECAP.[13] Diagnosticat includes all clinical influenza diagnosis codes (ICD-10
codes in Supplementary Table 1) and is updated from ECAP daily (since 2010). It presents
the frequency of daily influenza cases and the weekly incidence rates per 105 population, a
unit that allows diagnoses to be compared between territories independently of the number
of inhabitants. Influenza data on Diagnosticat has been shown to accurately represent that in
a gold-standard source, the sentinel network of influenza infection reports dataset.[11]
The number of COVID-19 clinical diagnoses were extracted and aggregated using the same
data source and methods as for influenza diagnoses. Clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 have
been recorded in ECAP since 27 February 2020, when bespoke codes were introduced
(Supplementary Table 1). Since March 15 2020, Catalan policies have advocated for cases
to be defined based on symptoms alone, with serological or PCR confirmation only required
when patients are admitted to hospital or are healthcare staff.[14]

Statistical analysis
Daily counts of influenza and COVID-19 cases were computed based on the frequency of
cases recorded in the previous 7-day period to avoid weekly effects on recording practice.
All influenza seasons in the study period (2010-2011 to 2019-2020) were analysed
separately to characterise annual epidemic curves for seasonal influenza.
Influenza seasons with a visually similar epidemic curve and similar peak case number to
that of the 2019-2020 season were selected to model predictions for 2019-2020. Auto
Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models [15] were fitted to the seasons
included in the analysis for the whole population and for three age groups, paedriatic
patients (under 15), adults (15-64), and elderly (over 64 years old).

From the fitted time series, the expected speed of decrease in the number of weekly
influenza cases for the 2019-2020 influenza season was calculated for each day after
the peak. The expected speed of decrease was defined as the difference between the
number of influenza diagnoses predicted between the current day t and the previous day t-1,
divided by the number of diagnoses predicted for the previous day t-1 ((casest(casest-1)-1).
Expected influenza cases were calculated using the sequence Gt = G0

t

*∏ k=1

Vk , where Gt

was the expected influenza cases in the period t, G0 was the number of cases at the peak
and Vk the speed of decrease at day k.
The expected influenza cases for each day on the 2019-2020 season were calculated from
the day of the season peak to 20 March 2020, the day of the data extraction. Excess
influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases, estimated
daily as above.
All analyses were performed in R, version 3.5.1. [16]

Results
Previous influenza epidemic curves
Four of the previous nine influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and
2016-2017) had an epidemic curve and number of influenza cases during the peak similar to
the 2019-2020 season, as shown in Figure 1. These four curves were used to estimate the
number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. The mean peak number of cases in
the included and excluded seasons was 12,762 and 14,680 respectively. The peak number
of cases in 2019-2020 was 12,066.

2019-2020 influenza epidemic description
In Catalonia, the 2019-2020 influenza epidemic reached its peak on 4 February 2020, with
12,066 cases in the previous 7 days. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the season compared
with past seasons, centred on the day of the peak. By eye, the downwards trend after the
peak initially looks very similar to the previous seasons. However, 20 days after the peak,
the curve starts to flatten, and the slope slows down. This abnormal pattern in the
descending part of the curve differs from the pattern in the previous seasons.

peak number of cases in each curve.

Expected versus observed cases
Figure 3 shows the observed and estimated numbers of weekly new influenza cases (with
95% CI) after the peak of the 2019-2020 influenza season. The estimated expected number
of cases were predicted using the selected previous influenza seasons.
In the whole population, observed cases were always greater than expected after the
seasonal influenza peak, to some extent. The difference was statistically significant for 23
days between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020. Most of these days fell after 8 March
2020, when the difference between observed and expected increased significantly and
observed cases remained above the 95% CI band for expected cases for 2 weeks.
There was a greater difference between observed and expected cases among people aged
15-64 years than in both the total population and other age groups, with 25 total days of
significant difference. The observed and expected cases diverged earlier than for the total
population, separating around 26 February 2020 and remaining significantly different for the
rest of the study period.

Observed and expected cases were generally similar in those older than 64 years, until 6
March 2020. Observed cases then quickly rose above expected cases, with the difference
becoming significant on 11 March 2020 and remaining so for 9 days, until 19 March 2020.
The shape of the observed cases curve for people younger than 15 years was similar to that
for people aged 15-64 years. However, the difference between observed and expected
cases was only significantly different for 11 days, between 6 March 2020 and 16 March
2020.

Excess influenza cases compared with COVID-19 diagnoses
Figure 4 depicts the number of excess influenza cases and COVID-19 diagnoses each day
after the peak of the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza epidemic. Excess influenza cases
increased rapidly from 24 February 2020, peaking on 7 March 2020. They steeply declined
from 15 March 2020, coinciding with an increase in the number of COVID-19 diagnoses.
There were 4,347 excess influenza cases and 1,497 clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 on 14
March 2020, comparing with just 2,575 excess influenza cases (40% less) and a striking
16,547 (539% increase) clinical diagnoses of COVID-19 on 20 March 2020.

Catalonia, Spain, as number of cases in the previous 7-day period, from the peak
of the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza epidemic (4 February 2020).

Discussion
In mid-February 2020, we observed an unusually high, larger than expected number of
influenza cases in the daily published data. In Catalonia, the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza
epidemic reached its peak on 4 February 2020. Based on previous years’ data, influenza
diagnoses were expected to decrease rapidly over the following weeks. However, the
number of influenza diagnoses instead remained stable, which was counterintuitive and
inconsistent with data from past influenza seasons. This increase in observed influenza
diagnoses over those expected, here named “excess influenza,” correlates over time with
the observed number of COVID-19 cases. Excess influenza cases could be used in future
for the early detection of competing outbreaks.
Using four of the previous nine influenza seasons as a benchmark, we detected 8,017
excess influenza cases between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 2020. This excess was
higher in people aged 15-64 years, with over 20% more cases than expected. The excess
started to decrease after 15 March 2020. Worryingly, these results suggest that SARS-CoV2 could have already been circulating in the Catalan population when the first imported case
was reported on 25 February 2020. People infected with COVID-19 may have been masked

under ILI diagnoses in primary care, allowing continuing community transmission of COVID19 before public health measures were taken.
To our knowledge, this is the first study attempting to quantify the start of the COVID-19
epidemic in Spain by comparing the number of reported ILI cases with the expected figures
based on previous influenza seasons. The excess influenza cases metric could be useful for
monitoring future outbreaks of COVID-19 and other competing viral epidemics.
Our study has several limitations. We used ecological data and modelled it using data from
previous seasons, therefore assuming a direct causal link between excess influenza cases
and the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we lack confirmatory tests or antigenic data for the
estimated excess influenza cases, our results agree with a recent study that tested all
influenza samples in Los Angeles for SARS-CoV-2, finding 2.2-10.7% of the tested samples
positive for the pathogen.[17]
The observed excess influenza cases could have been due to a panic effect, in which the
current coronavirus infodemic, a rapid spread of misinformation, has encouraged people to
consult healthcare professionals more frequently and for milder symptoms than usual.
However, our data showed that the number of influenza diagnoses dropped drastically and
COVID-19 diagnoses increased after 15 March 2020. New COVID-19 guidelines were
released on 15 March 2020 in Spain that recommended only testing hospital-admitted
patients and healthcare staff and encouraging GPs to diagnose COVID-19 clinically without
PCR confirmation.[14] At least some of the excess ILI cases were thus likely to have actually
been COVID-19 cases.
Our study also has strengths. The data used were good quality, as demonstrated in many
previous publications,[18–24] were obtained directly from primary-care records, and have
been validated against gold-standard sentinel systems. This existing database covers over
85% of the population of Catalonia, which allowed us to rapidly detect excess influenza
cases across the whole population and in different age groups.
In conclusion, the full extent of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is still unknown. The confirmed
number of cases may be just the tip of the iceberg, due to the lack of testing of patients
presenting

mild

COVID-19

symptoms.

We

need

comprehensive,

well-designed,

seroprevalence studies to know how many people have been infected. The surveillance of
excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could
help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 and other ILI-causing pathogens, supporting early
testing and public health responses.
