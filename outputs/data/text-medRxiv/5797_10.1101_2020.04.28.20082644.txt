Summary
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease.It was first
reported in Wuhan, China, and then broke out on a large scale around the world.This study aimed to
assess the clinical significance of two different nutritional indices in 245 patients with COVID-19.
Methods: In this retrospective single-center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who
confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases
were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered,
two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score;
(ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis
to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death .
Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In-hospital mortality was signifcantly
higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly
worse in the severe-CONUT group than in the moderate-, mild- , and normal-CONUT groups.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95%CI
(1.124-10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI（0.581-0.896）,P=0.003) were independent

predictors of all-cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that
the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in-hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95%
CI（2.147-273.327）, p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81%; AUC 0.753;
95% CI（0.644–0.862）;respectively).The PNI cutoff value was 40.58

(81.80 and 66.20%; AUC 0.778;

95% CI（0.686–0.809）; respectively).We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which

1. Introduction
In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also called severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei, China. The disease quickly and
violently broke out in other provinces of China and other parts of the world. The numbers of confirmed
cases have risen rapidly in the past three months. As of February 20, 2020, it has caused more than
75,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China[1]. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of
COVID-19 have been known through previous reports. According to Huang et al., COVID-19 patients
had fever, myalgia ,fatigue and dry cough[2][2][2]. But apart from the typical symptoms, there
wereasymptomatic patients and atypical symptoms, such as diarrhea and headache[3].Although most
patients were considered to have a good prognosis, elderly patients and patients with chronic
underlying diseases or severe clinical symptoms may have a poor prognosis[4]. In addition, high SOFA
scores and d-dimers greater than 1 µg / L might serve as risk factors to help clinicians identify patients
with poor prognosis early[5].
Nutritional status has attracted more and more attention in various clinical fields. Generally,
malnutrition is considered an indicator related to increased morbidity and mortalitys[6]. Therefore, the
assessments of early nutritional status of different diseases are important means to identify malnutrition,
nutritional risks, and possible benefit to nutritional interventions, as well as a prerequisite for guiding
nutritional treatment plans. Ideal nutritional risk screening tools and nutrition assessment methods
should accurately reflect the nutritional status of the body and predict the occurrence of
malnutrition-related complications. Traditional measurement methods, such as height or body mass
index (BMI) or laboratory indicators, such as albumin, prealbumin and total cholesterol levels, have
been used to assess the nutritional status of individuals[7]. However, they are limited to reflecting a
small portion of nutritional risks and cannot be comprehensive assessement .Interestingly, some studies
have shown that malnutrition is linked to the inflammatory response of chronic diseases and the
development of autoimmune diseases. At the same time, abnormal nutritional status is related to the
prognosis of malignancies and other diseases, such as heart failure, adult spinal deformity and
RA[8,9,10,11,12]. Therefore, understanding nutritional status aims to elucidate the prognostic
significance of various diseases. This suggests that assessing nutritional status has clinical significance
for disease prognosis[6].However, there are currently no standard recognized tools for nutritional risk
screening and assessment of nutritional status.Different methods have different effects on the accuracy
of predicting the prognosis of the diseases. Therefore, sensitivity, specificity, and ease-to-use tools are
often the main basis for clinical nutrition screening and evaluation.Recently, controlling nutritional
status (CONUT) score , prognostic nutritional index (PNI) have also been increasingly used as markers
of patients' nutritional status[13,14,15,16].The PNI was calculated by the following formula: 10 ×
serum albumin (g/dL) + 0.005 ×

lymphocyte count (per μ L).The lower score means worse

nutritional status.The CONUT score is composed of serum albumin, lymphocytes and total
cholesterol[11].Higher score means worse nutritional status.
Whether the two screening tools are suitable for assessing the prognosis of patients with COVID-19
remains unknown. Based on the information we have, there is currently no study on the effect of

nutritional status on the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Current assessments of the serious
consequences and risk factors for death of COVID-19 are not numerous and limitative [19]. Therefore,
the purpose of this study was to (i) investigate the relationship between two different nutritional indices
and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19, and (ii) evaluate the prognostic effect of these
indicators as predictors of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients
2. Methods
2.1. Patients
This retrospective cohort study finally included 245 adult patients (≥18 years of age) hospitalized at
Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on the
criteria published by World Health Organization interim guidance.Zhongnan Hospital was the

dedicated hospital in Wuhan to treat COVID-19 patients. Hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of
COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were consecutively enrolled in the present
study (n=270), from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020.A total of 25 patients were excluded: Life
support (such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), vasopressors, mechanical ventilation,
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) before admission died immediately after
admission :N = 2 (8%); lack most baseline data: N = 1 (4%); Transfer to other designated hospitals: N
= 10 (40%);

Pregnant woman: N = 6 (24%); Under 18 years old: N = 6 (24%). The rest of 245 cases

were included in this study.This study which complied with the Declaration of Helsinki (Approval
Number 2020054)was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University.

2.2. Clinical and Laboratory Data Collection
The demographic data collected age and gender. About baseline characteristics, gastrointestinal
symptoms , comorbidities and laboratory test results are from the Electronic Medical Record System of
Zhongnan Hospital. Collection of laboratory data includes Heart rate, Respiratory rate, Systolic
pressure,Diastolic pressure, Sodium(Na+), Potassium(K+), white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte
count, hemoglobin, Platelets,serum creatinine, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid （ UA ） ,
albumin, total cholesterol(TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,Procalcitonin(PCT).
Prothrombin time(PT),D- dimer.
2.3. Nutritional Indices Selection and Calculation
The study includestwo different nutritional indicators: CONUT score, PNI. The CONUT score, PNI are
calculated according to the following formulas: (i) The CONUT score is calculated based on 3
laboratory variables: serum albumin concentration, total cholesterol concentration, and total peripheral
lymphocytes cell count;Based on their CONUT scores, patients were divided into four groups:
normal-CONUT (0-1), mild-CONUT (2-4), moderate-CONUT (5-8) and severe-CONUT(≥9)[17]; (ii)
PNI is 10 x serum albumin value (g / dL) + 0.005 x total peripheral blood lymphocyte
count(unit/L);Patients were also divided into threegroups based on their PNI:severe-PNI (PNI＜35, ),
moderate-PNI (35 ≤ PNI < 38,), and normal-PNI (PNI ≥ 38）[18] .
2.4. Statistical Analysis

Analysis was performed using SPSS (version 22.0). Continuous variables were expressed as median

(interquartile range, IQR). Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between
nutritional indicators and selected baseline clinical data. We used the Mann Whitney U test, χ ² test, or
Fisher's exact test to compare the differences between categorical groups.Spearman rank correlation analysis
was used to analyze the correlation between nutritional indicators and selected baseline clinical datas.
Calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the ROC curve to predict hospital mortality and Used Youden to
determine the AUC

and cutoff value.Univariate

and

multivariate

logistic regression models

exploreddeath-related risk factors. Two-way p-values <0.05 are considered statistically significant.

3. Results
3.1. Clinical Characteristics of Patients
The baseline characteristics of 245 patients in this study was described in Table 1. Of the 245 patients who
were included in the study; severe group of PNI (PNI < 35,n = 31), moderate group of PNI (35 ≤ PNI < 38,
n = 30), and normal group of PNI (PNI ≥ 38, n = 182）.the CONUT score: normal-CONUT (0–1, n = 18),
mild-CONUT (2–4, n = 72), moderate-CONUT (5–8, n =58), and severe-CONUT (≥9, n = 7);The severe
group of PNI had significantly lower lymphocyte counts , albumin,high density lipoprotein (HDL)and total
cholesterol(TC),

observedvariables were different between the severe-CONUT group and the mild-, and normal-CONUT
groups (Tables 1, 2).The in-hospital death was signifcantly worse in the severe PNI group (n = 12, 38.71%)
than in the moderate- (n = 8, 26.67%) and normal- (n = 13, 7.14%) groups. It was also signifcantly worse in
the severe-CONUT group (n = 6, 85.71%) than in the moderate- (n = 12, 20.69%), mild- (n = 6, 8.3%), and
normal-CONUT (n = 1, 5.6%) groups (Fig. 1)
The median age was 55.0 years, of which 114 patients (46.5%) were male(TabelA). 33 patients died
during hospitalization and 212 were discharged(Tabel A). In terms of comorbidities, hypertension was the
most common comorbidity(21.2%), followed by diabetes(9.4%) and coronary heart disease(7.4%) (Table A).
The most common gastrointestinal symptom before admission was anorexia(22.9%), followed by
diarrhea(7.4%) (Table A). In the comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms, we could find that compared with
survivors, non-survivors are more prone to anorexia (57.6% vs 17.5%, p <0.001)(Table A).

3.3 Factors associated within-hospital death
This study used logistic regression analysis to clarify the factors related to death. In univariate analysis ,age,
gender,BMI,,anorexia, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, respiratory rate, white blood cell count,
ALT, creatinine, PCT,PNI and COUNT were significantly associated with death (Table 4). In the
multivariate logistic regression model, we found that the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95% CI
(1.124-10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95% CI（0.581-0.896）,P=0.003) were the independent
predictors of all-cause death after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, history of hypertension, history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease ， history of coronary heart disease ,respiratory rate, alanine transaminase,
creatinine, D-dimer, white blood cell count, Lymphocyte, PCT.A multivariate logistic regression model
showed that severe group (classifedin PNI groups) was an independent predictor of all-cause death (odds
ratio 24.225,95% CI(2.147-273.327),p=0.010), and in categorical groups of CONUT scorewerenot the
independent predictors of all-cause death(Table 5). The CONUT score,which demonstrated sensitivity

and specificity for predicting in-hospital death were 56.00% and 80.81% (AUC 0.753; 95% CI (0.644
– 0.862),p<0.001).The cutoff value of the COUNT scorewas 5.5 overall(Fig. 2A).The PNIcutoff
valuewas 40.58 overall (81.80and 66.20%, respectively; AUC 0.778; 95%CI (0.686–0.809),
p<0.001)(Fig. 2B).

4. Discussion
In this study, we reported on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients and the risk factors
associated with death. To the author's knowledge, this study was the first to assess the importance of two
different nutritional indicators in COVID-19 patients.The COUNT score and PNI had specific statistical
differences between non-survivors and survivors. However, in the multivariable logistic regression
analysis,theCONUT

score

and

PNI

were

the

independent

predictors

of

all-cause

death,individually.According to the area under the curve of ROC,PNI was a better predictor of all-cause
death than the COUNT score. In addition,according to the categorical groups of PNI, severe group was an
independent predictor ofall-cause death. We could get this revelationthat the worse nutritional status, the
greater risk for death .Our research found that the CONUT score and PNI might be related to some clinical
features and laboratory variables.These findings pointed out that rapid assessment tools could judge the early
nutritional status of COVID-19 patients and emphasized that early intervention for malnourished people
could affect the prognosis.
Nutrition plays an important role in human survival and medical development.Malnutrition is caused by
low nutrient feeding or malabsorption，which induced by hepatic insufficiency, anorexia,cytokine-induced
high catabolism, intestinal edema. It is a common complication of many diseases[19].Malnourished patients
may have the following symptoms: fatigue, weakness,low daily activities, weight loss, cognitive
impairment ,decreased muscle volume[20]. In this condition, the disease gradually worsens[21]. It is well
known that malnutrition impairs immune function, especially cell-mediated immunity[22]. Decreased
nutritional status of the body leads to decreased immunity, which directly causes or induces the occurrence
of nosocomial infections, and increases the morbidity and mortality associated with infections[23].

The nutritional status assessed by the CONUT score and PNI as the prognostic indicators for patients with
cardiovascular disease, malignant tumors, and acute ischemic stroke have caused the attention by researchers.
And their clinical value is more comprehensive, economical, simple and practical than other tools.The
CONUT score and PNI were first used to estimate the correlation between malnutrition risks and
postoperative complications in patients with gastrointestinal tumors, and there was increasing evidence that
they were also related to the prognosis of other malnourished malignancies and diseases[24,25,26,27].We
know that the CONUT score is calculated based on 3 laboratory variables, serum albumin,lymphocytes, and
total cholesterol (range 0–12, higher = worse).One study on COVID-19 confirmed that most patients had
lymphopenia when they were admitted to the hospital, and that there was a decrease in albumin[28]. Studies
have suggested that albumin and lymphocyte percentage might be predictors of disease severity[29]. The
CONUT score weights are relatively equal between serum albumin, lymphocyte counts, and total cholesterol
levels, while PNI is mainly determined by serum albumin levels and lymphocyte counts. In addition,
considering that lymphocyte counts have been associated with increased disease severity. Furthermore, the
lymphocytes of patients who died of COVID-19 were reported to be significantly lower than those of
survivors[30].These supported our research results,whichsuggested that among the nutrition indicators,
COUNT score and PNI wererelated to death.. It has been found that some parameters are related to the
prognosis of COVID-19 patients.Previously, according to the research, elderly age was an important
independent predictor of death in patients with SARS and MERS[31]. Currently ， COVID-19 study also
confirmed that patient's age was concerning with death. Increasing age was a predictor, which was consistent
with age-related mortality study with an OR of 1.10[5]. Older age might be associated with more
complications, which increased the mortality rate. In one study, predictors related to 30-day mortality
included older, non-healthcare workers, pre-existing conditions, disease severity, and hospital-acquired
infections[31].Interestingly, BMI was originally considered only as a way to measure body composition, but
now obesity is considered a chronic inflammatory state that may affect the immune system through
fat-derived inflammation[32]. COVID-19 was currently considered to have potential complex
immunological damage[30]. However, in this study, BMI itself significantly differed between the death and
survival groups in univariate logistics analysis model. In fact, whether BMI can be used as an evaluation
index to evaluate the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients requires further study.It is unclear whether
individual parameters (such as serum albumin, blood lipids, vitamins) can be used to assess the nutritional
status of COVID-19 patients to predict adverse outcomes.But these single parameter indicators may also be
needed to support our conclusions, especially blood lipids and albumin .The advantage of this study was that,
to the author's knowledge, this was the first study to assess the clinical significance of different nutritional
indicators in patients with COVID-19. Our research will help clinicians to pay attention to the assessment of
nutritional status of COVID-19 patients for early intervention and early treatment of COVID-19 patients
with poor nutritional status.

5.Limitation
However, our study has some limitations. First, the number of patients included is relatively small. Only 155
of the 245 patients who were screened had their albumin levels, lymphocyte counts, and total cholesterol
levels collected within 30 min of admission ,which resulting in a relatively low sample size for COUNT
scores.Second,this study was conducted at a single-center research with limited sample size. This study
might have included disproportionately more patients with poor outcomes. There might also be a selection
bias when identifying factors that influence the clinical outcomes.

6 .Conclusion
In conclusion, the study has pointed out that the CONUT score and PNI were the independent risk factors for
COVID-19 death .The assessment of the nutritional status of COVID-19 patients is crucial to the prognosis.
