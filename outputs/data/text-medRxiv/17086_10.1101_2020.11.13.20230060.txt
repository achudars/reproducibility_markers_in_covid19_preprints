ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the
greatest public health defiant on a global scale in the last 100 years. Governments and health
Institutes face challenges during the pandemic, related to the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment,
and timely detection after the epidemic peak for the prevention of new infections and the
evaluation of the real impact of the COVID-19 disease in different geographic areas. To
develop a valuable tool to study the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Colombia, an
“in-house” ELISA was achieved for the detection of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum.
The test was standardized using a antigenic epitopes “Pool” of synthetic peptide as antigen
derived from antigenic regions of the spike, nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane structural
proteins, which were designed, based on the genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 circulating
in Colombia. In the ELISA standardization process, 34 positive sera were used, including sera
from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (mild and severe) and 68 negative sera,
including pre-pandemic historical negatives originating from patients living in arbovirus
endemic areas or patients with a history of respiratory diseases and sera from patients with a
negative rRT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. The in-house peptide ELIPSE-COL test showed
promising performance, being able to detect reactivity in sera from asymptomatic and
symptomatic patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 91% for both
parameters. The ELIPSE-COL assay was developed as an ELISA test using synthetic
peptides for the study of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Colombia.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Peptides, serologic test.

INTRODUCTION
The life-threatening respiratory illness called COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2
betacoronavirus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and impacted the public health
on a global scale with no precedence in the 21st century (1, 2). The COVID-19 disease caused
almost 100.000 cases and 5.000 deaths in China, however, after global dissemination and ten
months of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 infection has cost over one million of life lost and
near 35 million cases (3). The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was reported on March 6th
and to October near 900.000 cases and 25.000 deaths have been reported (4).
The genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 is encoded in a single, positive-stranded RNA
(ssRNA[+]), with near 30.000 nucleotides long. The first of the nine open reading frames (ORF)
composing the SARS-CoV-2 genome is subdivided in ORF1a and ORF1b by ribosomal
frameshifting and encodes two polyproteins which are processed into non-structural proteins
involved in subgenomic/genome length RNA synthesis and virus replication. In the
subgenomic region, the structural proteins, Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and
Nucleocapsid (N) are encoded in subgenomic mRNA transcripts within ORFs 2, 4, 5, and 9,
respectively (5). The Structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been exploited as an ideal
antigen from different applications including, IgG or IgM chromatographic rapid test (6), ELISA
test (7) and to produce polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in animal models (8). Most of
the reported applications use recombinant DNA approaches, however, synthetic peptide
technologies are also available as desirable ligands in the development of new antibody
detection tests.
Short peptides became important reagents in epitope mapping since the technology to
synthesize large numbers of peptides on solid support was developed in the 1980s (9, 10).
Peptides can be synthesized in large quantities with very high purity and without recombinant
cellular expression systems, and those who specifically bind to target antibodies are valuable
ligands useful in serological assays (10, 11). Relative chemical stability of short peptides and
the relative ease with which they can be synthesized and manipulated (12, 13).
According to the epidemiological surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia, the
epidemic peak could have occurred between August and September 2020, and at this moment
timely case detection, strategies for the prevention of new infections, and the evaluation of the
true impact of the COVID-19 disease in Colombia are needed. Taking all this into
consideration, this study aimed to develop an “in-house” ELISA test using rational designed
synthetic peptides as an antigen for the detection of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera
from humans being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The achieved test is ELIPSE-COL, a valuable
tool for the study of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Colombia.

Peptide Design
Worldwide and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were retrieved from GISAID and
NCBI
databases
(https://www.gisaid.org/,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/).
Substitution matrices of nucleotides and amino acids of structural proteins were generated
from a multiple sequence alignment with the SARS-CoV-2 genomes using the Muscle
Algorithm (14) in MEGA X (15). In silico analyses were performed to identify the presence of
LB epitopes, including the presence of proteasome cleavage sequence sites, HLA-I and HLAII different length binding epitope sequences regarding endosomal and phagosome-lysosome
protease cleavage sites in each ORF coded sequence using LBtope
(http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/lbtope/),
ABCpred
main
page
http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/abcpred/
and
BEpiPred-2.0
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) bearing a threshold: 0,5. Aminoacid sequences
containing antigenic regions being exposed in a non-conformational configuration were
selected for peptide design.
Optimization of peptide designs was performed using the peptide analyzing tool of
ThermoFisher
(https://www.thermofisher.com/co/en/home/life-science/proteinbiology/peptides-proteins/custom-peptide-synthesis-services/peptide-analyzing-tool.html) to
calculate the peptide physical-chemical properties, including the charge-pH map, isoelectric
point (pI), hydrophobicity, and mass and predict the ease of peptide synthesis and purification.
Solid-phase Peptide Synthesis
The peptides designed were synthesized from two sources: the first one was a commercial
ThermoFisher platform Peptide Synthesis Services, and the second one was produced in
collaboration of two research groups (National Health Insitute of Colombia and National
University of Colombia). Therefore, the selected peptides were synthesized manually using a
solid-phase synthesis by 9‐fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy. Solvents and soluble
reagents were removed by filtration. Washings between deprotection, couplings, and
subsequent deprotection steps were carried-out with N,N′‐dimethylformamide (DMF) (5 x
1min), dichloromethane (DCM) (4 x 1min), Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (2 x 1min) and DCM (2 x
1min) using 1.5 mL of solvent/50mg of resin each time. The Fmoc group was removed from
the resin by two treatments of 15 min with piperidine‐DMF (25:75 v/v). Couplings were
performed at 20°C and monitored using standard Kaiser tests for solid‐phase synthesis. after
Fmoc removal of the commercially available Rink amide resin (50 mg, 0.46 mmol/g), a first
Fmoc-amino-acid (0.115mmol, 5.0 equiv.) was added with 1-hydroxy benzotriazole (HOBt)
(18.2 mg, 0.115 mmol; 5.0 equiv.) and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (23.7 mg; 5.0
equiv.) as coupling reagents dissolved in DMF/DCM (7:3, v/v) and the coupling reaction was
stirred for 2 hours. Next, the Fmoc group was removed, and a second Fmoc-amino-acid was
incorporated in the resin using the same conditions. The Fmoc removal and the coupling
reactions of the rest of the Fmoc-amino-acids were carried out under the same conditions
using 5 equiv./coupling. Finally, monomer peptide was Fmoc deprotected and cleaved from
the resin by treatment with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid- water- triisopropylsilane
(TFA/H2O/TIS) (95.0:2.5:2.5) for 6 hours followed by filtration and precipitation with cold diethyl
ether (Et2O). Crude products were then triturated 3 times with cold Et2O, dissolved in the
system water-acetonitrile (H2O:CH3CN) (9:1 v/v), and then lyophilized (9). Protocols adapted
from published data were also used (16).
Samples
Thirty-four sera from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 by the confirmation of SARS-CoV-2
infection by rRT-PCR were selected. Ten sera of them were from asymptomatic patients and
24 sera from patients with symptoms, of which 10 presented mild symptoms and 14 severe

symptoms. Blood samples were taken from each of the asymptomatic and symptomatic
patients between 14 to 21 days after the first date of diagnosis by rRT-PCR. Sixty-eight
samples were selected from the Biological samples Bank of the National Institute of Health of
Colombia and which were corroborated by rRT-PCR of the absence of SARS-CoV-2. Sixteen
of them came from endemic areas for arbovirosis (Zika. Dengue, Chikungunya ) and which
were obtained months before the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Colombia.
ELIPSE-COL: immunodiagnostic assay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
Polystyrene 96-flat bottom plates (Inmulon IB) were immobilized overnight with a “Pool” of 7
proteins peptides: 2 of Spike protein peptides, 3 Nucleocapsid proteins peptides from different
antigenic regions, 1 Membrane protein-peptide, and 1 Envelope protein-peptide all of them
derived from antigenic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The “Pool” of proteins peptides (antigen) was
adsorbed to the polystyrene plates in concentrations ranging from 5 µg/ mL to 40 ug/ mL in a
carbonate/bicarbonate buffer at a pH of 9.6 at 4oC. Followed three washes with PBS using a
Well Washing 4MK2 machine (Thermo Scientific).
Non-specific binding was blocked with a solution of 1-5% of skimmed-milk in 0,15M
(phosphate-buffered solution) PBS-0.05% (v/v) tween-20. Followed three washes with PBS
using a Well Washing 4MK2 machine (Thermo Scientific).
Different dilutions from 1:25 to 1:200 of human sera samples were poured onto peptide
adsorbed-ELISA plate wells and incubated for 3 hours at 37oC. Followed three washes with
PBS using a Well Washing 4MK2 machine (Thermo Scientific). Then a goat alkaline
phosphatase anti-human-Ig-conjugate was poured at 1:500 of dilution on PBS-Tween-20 and
incubated for one hour at 37oC to bind specific human antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.
After performing standard washings, the test was developed with a 1 mg/mL pnitrophenylphosphate solution in 0,1M diethanolamine, pH 9.8 to reveal those antibodies
specifically binding to designed virus epitopes by a yellow color appearance which was
detected on a microplate reader (Multiscan EX®, ThermoFisher scientific,) at 405 nm. When
necessary enzyme activity was stopped by adding a 3N NaOH solution before absorbance
reading.
Statistical analysis
Determination of the cut-off point
The cut-off value was determined taking into account the absorbance value that differentiated
between positive and negative samples. This value was calculated by adding two standard
deviations to the mean value of the negative samples, which offers 95% reliability. (17, 18).
Coefficient of variation (CV)
The coefficient of variation (CV) was obtained by intra-plate repeatability and inter-plate
repeatability. To evaluate intra-plate repeatability, four replicates of 24 samples were tested.
Inter-plate repeatability was evaluated by using the same samples in four different plates. CV
was calculated as CV = (standard deviation/mean) × 100% Agreement within CIEP and
peptide ELISA data was obtained by analysis of the same serum (19).
Diagnostic discrimination
The following diagnostic indicators were deduced by the given formulae:


Sensitivity (SE): Number of true positive samples=true positive sample number
number of false-negative samples



Specificity (SP): Number of true negative samples=number of true negative samples
number of false-positive samples



Positive Predictive Value (PPV): Number of true positives / The sum of true positives
and false positives



Negative Predictive Value (NPV): Number of true negatives / The sum of true negatives
and false negatives



Positive Likelihood Ratio (CPP): Sensitivity / 1 - Specificity



Negative Probability Ratio (NPC): (1 - Sensitivity) / Specificity



Coincidence rate (CR): true positive sample number + true negative sample number /
number of total samples

Descriptive Statistical Analysis
The average value of the absorbance values (three absorbance values obtained per sample)
was calculated for both positive and negative samples. As well as the dispersion means of the
mean absorbance values (Standard Deviation). A comparison of mean ranges between the
groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way
analysis of variance followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test as required. All statistical
tests were performed with a 5% level of significance. Graphs were constructed in GraphPad
Prism software version 7.0.
RESULTS
Antigenic peptides
A representative antigenic peptides were pooled and used as the antigen for ELIPSE-COL
and following named "Pool". Such selective mix antigenic peptide representative for SARSCoV-2 was achieved by combining the most representative synthesized peptide epitopes
containing antigenic regions of the structural proteins: ThermoFisher platform Peptide
Synthesis Services (1 antigenic region of the Spike protein, 2 antigenic regions of the
nucleocapsid protein) and those designed by the research groups, including antigenic regions
correspond to a region of the Spike protein, 1 region of the nucleocapsid protein, 1 region of
the envelope protein, and 1 region of the membrane protein.

ELIPSE-COL: ELISA test developed for serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
ELIPSE-COL immunodiagnostic test was developed taking into account the characteristics
hydrophobic properties of the peptides used (“Pool of Peptides”) as antigens. The peptides
adhered to Immulon IB polystyrene plates once the physicochemical characteristics of
Immulon IB had been analyzed versus polypropylene, polycarbonate, and nylon, also
considering the importance of using plates transparent flat bottom for adequate passage of
light at a wavelength of 405 nanometers (nm) through each well. Sodium carbonate/
bicarbonate buffer solution pH 9.4 at 0.2 M was selected as a coating solution and adherence
of peptides to plate wells. This pH 9.4 value helps the solubility of many proteins and peptides
by ensuring that most proteins are not protonated with an overall negative charge, which aids
in the adsorption of peptides to the positively charged plate, others solutions such as Tris
Buffer Saline (TBS) or Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) were considered (20, 21). Coated wells
with the "Peptide Pool" could leave free hydrophobic/hydrophilic sites on the polystyrene

bottom of the plate. These sites must be blocked with a specific step called "post-coating" to
avoid non-specific binding of subsequent reagents. In the ELIPSE-COL test, the 5% skim-milk
solution was used as a viable option for blockade considering its commercial value and
affordability, although 5% of serum albumin could also be used. Both allow a real blockade in
such a way that it is possible to differentiate between positive and negative serum (Fig. 1).
Antigen-antibody binding can be visualized using alkaline phosphatase-linked conjugate.
Unlike peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase activity is not altered by exposure to antibiotics and
other agents such as thimerosal or sodium azide. This means that the enzyme can be stored
for a defined time, even in a non-sterile environment (22). Taking these characteristics into
account, a test using alkaline phosphatase can be performed in any laboratory, with minimal
conditions without affecting the results.
After the standardization process, it was found that the optimal test conditions corresponded
to 25 µg/ml of the peptide pool, serum dilution of 1:25 with incubation of 3 hours, and dilution
of 1: 500 of the peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (Fig. 1).
The coefficient of variation of the test in intra-plate repeatability and inter-plate repeatability
experiments had a dispersion from 5.4% to 19.25%, with an average variation of 13%. It has
been reported that the CV for this parameter should not exceed 20%, being optimal those
below 5% and 10% respectively.
Diagnostic discrimination

The ELIPSE-COL test based in synthetic peptides shows a differential serological reaction to
the COVID-19 positives and negatives sera. The variation in the amplitude of the standard
deviation bars in the group of sera from positive patients (with COVID-19) (Fig. 2) can be
attributed to the inclusion of sera from convalescent patients (Hospitalized) for which values
of absorbance up to 1.7 were registered, unlike the values observed in the group of sera from
patients without COVID-19. Statistically significant values were found between the median
absorbances of sera from patients with COVID-19 versus sera from patients without COVID19.
The absorbance cut-off value was estimated at 0.278 and it was applied to differentiate
between positive and negative samples. Diagnostic classification of the study groups for the
ELIPSE-COL test is shown in table 1, 31/34 positive sera, and 62/68 negative sera were
properly classified by the “in-house” test.
The diagnostic classification by positive/negative groups obtained for the test was used to
calculate the parameters of diagnostic accuracy and operational performance of the ELIPSECOL immunodiagnostic test, which showed the following values for each of the indicators
(Table 2):
DISCUSSION
The detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during the COVID-19 pandemic has been
focused on using immunodiagnostic tests that use recombinant proteins as capture antigen.
(23-25). These immunodiagnostic tests differ in their sensitivity and specificity values, which
makes it difficult to use a single one for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
worldwide. During the pandemic, the ELISA tests more often used are based on recombinant
protein (25) designed with the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes, this proteins could not recall the
changes in the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 that appears after the emerging of the virus
and its global dissemination (26).

The “pool” of synthetic peptides were designed based on the genomic information of SARSCoV-2 (Coronavirus) circulating in Colombia integrate the most important antigenic regions of
the structural proteins of the coronavirus, which is a guarantee to detect antibodies targeted
against different parts of the virus, which favors detection thus, non-synonymous substitutions
occur in the virus genome. In fact, in the design of the peptides, it was taken into account that
12 lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulate in Colombia, which present changes in the sequences
concerning the coronavirus initially characterized in Wuhan (27).
One of the most studied amino acid changes in SARS-CoV-2 is the substitution of aspartic
acid for glycine at position 614 of the S1 subunit of the Spike protein (28) and it is known that
this substitution interrupts an antigenic region in this protein (29). Given the above, if this were
to happen at one point in time and which could occur, it would not drastically affect the
performance of the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies due to the presence in the
peptide pool of the other proteins that comprise it and that were developed conserving 2
different peptides of the Spike protein, 3 different peptides of the Nucelocapsid, 1 peptide of
the Envelope and 1 peptide of the Membrane that is also antigenic and are used in ELIPSECOL developed in the present study
Several of the immunoassays developed for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies tend
to focus exclusively on the Spike protein and particularly on the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) of the protein as an antigen to detect neutralizing antibodies given the SARS-COV-2
pathway via ACE2 receptor (30, 31). However, this is beyond the scope of an ELISA test and
the presence of this type of antibody must be verified with a plaque reduction neutralization
test (PRNT) (7, 32), therefore, this guidance may limit the performance of an ELISA test that
is designed to detect whether the person is or has been exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Nonetheless, some studies have been suggested that epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein could be correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients
(33, 34) or with the disease severity (35).
One of the disadvantages of using peptides is their non-renewable after synthesis, unlike
recombinant antigens that can be produced in cell lines at different times. However, As in the
case of this study, the production of peptides can be obtained individually at a scale of 100
milligrams, and in the immunodiagnostic test developed (ELIPSE-Col) only 6 micrograms of
the “peptide pool” are used per test. Given the above, a production of 100 milligrams with an
approximate time of eight days allows the testing of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 16,600
people, which is not a critical disadvantage given its scale of production obtained in the study.
Furthermore, if a substitution in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence were to occur, the
immunodiagnostic test developed with them could be adaptable in a week and this would have
a positive impact on preserving the performance and functionality of ELIPSE-Col. An
advantage of synthetic peptides could be to produce them to same or bigger scale to describe
before at the time the SARS-CoV-2 change.
The synthetic peptides used in the ELIPSE-COL immunodiagnostic test are an advantage in
the performance of the test due to their specificity, which avoids cross-reactions with endemic
arboviruses (36) and other coronaviruses such as (Human Coronavirus 229E, Human
Coronavirus NL63, Human Coronavirus OC43, and Human Coronavirus HKU1 circulating in
Colombia (37).

As far as the scientific literature allows, immunodiagnostic tests to detect SARS-CoV-2
antibodies using synthetic peptides as performed. Meng and co-workers used a "pool" of
peptides from the Spike protein to detect immunodominant regions of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
(33) and the ELIPSE-COL used a "Pool" of peptides from different regions of SARS-CoV-2
but with the purpose of detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient serum.
The use of peptides for immunodiagnosis in the case of SARS and MERS is known when
Woo, et. al., in 2005 developed an ELISA test to detect anti-SARS-CoV IgG and IgM
antibodies using peptide pool as antigen independently of the Spike and Nuclocapsid proteins
with sensitivities of 74.7% and 94.75%, respectively (38). The presence of both targets (Spike
and Nucleocapsid) and other structural peptides of SARS-CoV-2 in the ELIPSE-Col “Pool”
favor its performance with a sensitivity of 91%.
In the current SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic, various immunodetection tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgG and IgM have been suggested. In the systematic review carried out by Lisboa-Bastos
and co-workers compared nine ELISA studies to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, they report
that the sensitivity of the ELISA on average was 84.3% with a confidence interval (CI 95%)
between 75.6% and 90.9% (6). The ELIPSE-Col test has a sensitivity of 91%, which places it
in the upper limit to that reported in the systematic review. In this same review, the average
specificity was 97.6%, ranging between 93.2% and 99.4%, values higher than the 91% found
in the present study, but which do not prevent its use in immunodiagnosis, considering the
inclusion of negative sera from patients from endemic areas for arboviruses and other
circulating coronaviruses in Colombia.
These results constitute an evidence that supports the using of rationaly designed peptides
and their strategical mixtures, as important molecular tools useful for detection of antibodies
to SARS-CoV-2, revealing acceptable specificity and sensitivity as an immunodiagnostic test.
