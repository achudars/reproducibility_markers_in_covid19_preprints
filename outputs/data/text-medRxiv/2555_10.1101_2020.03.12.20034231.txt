Abstract
The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)
diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of
samples at 56

℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of

transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is
still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat
inactivation of serum at 56

℃

for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence

immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes
with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples
(100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels
were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar
changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12%
of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting
heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate

that heat inactivation of serum at 56

℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis

of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not
recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the
sample was pre-inactivated by heating.

Introduction
The current outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a serious threat
to public health.1-3 Early diagnosis of suspect cases is critical to reduce and interrupt the
transmission of COVID-19 from person-to-person.4 Currently, laboratory testing of viral
nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
assay is the “gold standard” for COVID-19 diagnosing.5 However, the requirement of
sophisticated instruments and laboratory conditions, tedious experimental procedures,
and longer detection time significantly hamper its widespread applicability.4 Antibodies
produced in the blood after COVID-19 infection are emerging as a promising class of
biomarkers.6 The antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are specific, sensitive, and more importantly,
their detection can be much faster and simpler than RT-PCR, which allows rapid
screening of suspect cases to be possible.7

All the biological specimens for COVID-19 testing should be considered to be
potentially infectious. Therefore, test must be performed by medical professionals with
protective equipment in a qualified laboratory. To further reduce the risk of exposure to
infectious agents, viral inactivation before sample handling are usually be recommended.8,
9

While the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to the conditions of inactivation is unknown, it is

reported that many coronavirus such as SARS are heat-sensitive and can be killed at 56

℃ could be an effective approach
However, the effect of heating at 56 ℃ on COVID-19

for 30 minutes.10-14 It is thus inferred that heating at 56
for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation.15

antibody detection is unclear. The objective of this study was to compare the levels of

COVID-19 antibody before and after heat inactivation.

Methods
A total of 34 serum samples with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody results from patients
with COVID-19 infections and 9 serum form non-COVID-19 diseases were collected form
Hankou Hospital, Wuhan city with approval of the ethics committee (hkyy2020-004). All
patients with COVID-19 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. The antibody detection kits
for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained from KingFocus Biomedical engineering Co.,Ltd
(AIE/Quantum dot-based fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, AFIA). The
immunoassay quantitatively measures IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Serum
samples before and after heat inactivation at 56

℃

for 30 minutes were analyzed

according to the protocol. Briefly, 100 microliters of serum was dropped on the test card
and the fluorescence signal was measured after 15 minutes. Detection values above the
cut-off threshold are considered positive.

Results
In the patients with COVID-19, the IgM signals of all the 34 serum samples (100%)
decreased

12 samples (35.29%) increased with a median percentage of 24.22%. 44.12% of the IgM
signals form COVID-19 patients were below the cut-off value after heat inactivation. In the
non-COVID-19 group, the IgM levels were decreased in 7 of 9 samples (77.78%) by an
average of 43.31% (Figure 2) after heat inactivation and 2 samples (22.22%) increased
with an average level of 29.84% ([95% CI,5.44%-54.23%]). The IgG signals were
decreased in 7 of 9 samples (77.78%) by an average level of 79.42% ([95%
CI,44.54%-114.31%]), and 2 samples (22.22%) increased with an average level of 44.00%

cut-off value after heating.

Discussion
This study analyzes the changes in SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentration before and
after heat inactivation at 56

℃ for 30 minutes. We found that after heat inactivation, all of

the serum IgM (100%) demonstrated significantly lower levels. For IgG, 64.71% of the
sample levels dropped after heat inactivation.
All immunological assays are highly dependent on the recognition and binding of
antigens to antibodies. The decrease in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels may be related to
their structural change of denaturation and aggregation.16,17 Previous studies have shown
that antibodies can be denatured and lose their antigen binding activities after heating,18
and IgM is reported to be less thermally stable than IgG19,20 due to their different
compositions and structures of heavy chains.21 This is consistent with our results that
SARS-CoV-2 IgM concentration decreased more significantly than IgG after heating. In

addition, the IgG levels in 12 samples (35.29%) increased with a median of 24.22% after
heating, which may be due to the increases immunogenicity caused by the formation of
IgG aggregates heating at 56 .16,22,23 It is noteworthy that after heat inactivation, 44.12%
of the IgM levels form COVID-19 patients were below the cut-off value. These results
suggests that heat inactivation of serum can lead to false-negative results in these
samples.

Conclusions
Heat inactivation of serum at 56

℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis

of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. For highly suspected cases, the possibility of false-negative
results should be considered if the sample was inactivated by heating.
