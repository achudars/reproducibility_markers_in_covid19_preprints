ABSTRACT

25

Objectives: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection

26

cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time,

27

raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really

28

to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to

29

answer this question.

30

Methods: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate

31

different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-

32

lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-

33

reducing immunity.

34

Results: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the

35

reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we

36

find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity.

37

Conclusions: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational

38

resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day

39

that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to

40

analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its

41

immune response becomes available.

Introduction

43

Between 24th August and today, nine phylogenetically confirmed cases of COVID-19

44

reinfection have been discovered worldwide – the first in Hong Kong (To et. al. 2020), two

45

more in Greater Noida, India (Sinha, Gupta et. al. 2020), two in Belgium (van Elslande et. al.,

46

Selhorst et. al. 2020), two in USA (Goldman et. al., Tillett et. al. 2020), one in Ecuador

47

(CGTN 2020) and one in the Netherlands (Mulder et. al. 2020). In eight of these cases, the

48

patients were presumed immunocompetent; among these, the second infections were milder

49

than the first in six cases and more severe in two. Much about the immune response to SARS-

50

CoV-2 is currently unknown. Edridge et. al. (2020) have found that immunity against

51

infection by benign coronaviruses (not SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2!) lasts for a

52

few months and reinfection is common from one year onwards. Wajnberg et. al (2020), at

53

Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, USA found that among a cohort of almost 20,000

54

patients, all but one demonstrated significant antibody titre levels in blood plasma at three

55

months following the original infection. Siddiqui et. al. (2020) corroborated these results via

56

a smaller study conducted at Max Hospital, New Delhi, India.

57

An observational cohort study (Crawford et. al. 2020) on 34 patients conducted at the

58

University of Washington at Seattle found that over a 3- to 5-month period, antibody

59

concentrations decreased over time, in a manner consistent with the immune responses to

60

acute infections by other viruses including influenza, SARS and MERS. In these infections,

61

the initial decrease in titres is followed by a plateau; whether this is true of SARS-CoV-2 is

62

unknown as of now. Abu-Raddad et. al. (2020) have reported that out of more than 1,30,000

63

patients in Doha, Qatar infected with COVID-19, 243 persons reported a positive swab 45 or

64

more days after the original positive test; 54 out of these 243 had “strong or good evidence

65

for reinfection”. All the reinfections were asymptomatic or presented mild symptoms on the

66

second bout; however the initial symptom profile of these patients had been mild or

67

asymptomatic as well. Kowitdamrong et. al. (2020) report upto 20 percent post-infection

68

seroconversion failure rate in mild or asymptomatic patients in Thailand – they do not

69

document any reinfection cases. Lumley et. al. (2020) have very recently reported an

70

antibody half-life of 85 days and a median time of 137 days to loss of positivity; these results

71

are corrborated by Robertson et. al. (2020). A few potential cases of reinfection have also

72

been reported in media for some time before the first documented case – in these instances,

73

the evidence is not fully credible (McCamon, Saplakoglu, Ackerly 2020) .

74

Two systematic reviews deal with the antibody response (Post et. al. 2020) and the cellular

75

immune response (Shrotri et. al. 2020) to the virus. The former contains amplification of the

76

kind of results we discussed above; the latter states that the response of T-cells to SARS-

77

CoV-2 is currently unknown. Lavine et. al. (2020) propose that the immune response to the

78

virus will determine the manner of transition of COVID-19 to endemicity; in the absence of

79

known facts, this work is predominantly speculative at this time. Recent cross-sectional

80

studies from Paris (Anna et. al. 2020) and London (Ward et. al. 2020) find decreasing

81

seroprevalence as a function of time; this may be related to decreasing titre levels and might

82

indicate a possibility of reinfection. In two recent, reassuring developments, Zuo et. al. (2020)

83

in Manchester, UK and Ogega et. al. (2020) in Baltimore, USA have found significant levels

84

of T- respectively B-cells in recovered patients at 25 respectively 15 weeks following

85

infection; both studies included mild or asymptomatic patients as well as patients with very

86

low antibody titre levels. This indicates that durable cellular immunity may be present against

87

this virus even if antibodies decay over time.

88

Although the reinfection cases so far are isolated, the almost daily updates on the immune

89

response to SARS-CoV-2 make us wonder what the epidemiological consequences might be

90

if the immunity duration indeed turns out to be finite for a significant fraction of the

91

population. The only approach which can allow inroads into this question is mathematical

92

modeling. Giordano et. al. (2020) and Bjornstad et. al. (2020) account for the possibility of

93

reinfection, with the latter finding an oscillatory approach towards the eventual endemic

94

equilibrium. Kosinski (2020) however finds multiple waves of COVID-19 if the immunity

95

duration is finite. Sandmann et. al. (2020), in an analysis of this situation in the context of a

96

vaccine, find smooth oscillations about an endemic equilibrium, which change to jerky

97

oscillations with periodic lockdown. In this Article, we show that the case trajectories with

98

temporary immunity actually depend in an intricate manner on the reproduction number R.

99

Before commencing our analysis, we clarify that we are currently treating large-scale

100

temporary immunity as a hypothetical, hopefully worst-case scenario, regarding the validity

101

of which we do not yet have sufficient available data. Also, in this work, we do not attempt to

102

model the effects of vaccination; all the possibilities that might come into play after

103

introduction of this new variable will be considered in a subsequent analysis.

104
105

Methods

106

We start from a delay differential equation (DDE) model constructed by our group (Shayak

107

et. al. 2020, Mohit and Shayak 2020, hereinafter referred to as “References [26,27]”), which

108

accounts for many realistic features associated with COVID-19 transmission. This model can

109

be easily adapted to accommodate a given immune response. The dependent variable y(t)

110

denotes the cumulative number of corona cases in the region of interest (typically a town,

111

neighbourhood, village or other area with good interaction among the inhabitants) as a

112

function of time, measured in days. The parameters in the model are:

113

•

m0 : the per-case spreading rate which accounts for factors such as the degree of

114

mobility (i.e. lockdown/unlock), extent of mask use, extent of handwashing and other

115

public health measures

119

•

μ3 : the fraction of patients (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) who are NOT

120
121

detected in contact tracing drives and quarantined (0<μ3<1)
•

N : the total number of susceptible people in the region at the start of the epidemic

122

In References [26,27], we had assumed that one bout of infection renders everlasting

123

immunity (practically, immunity lasting longer than the epidemic’s progression). Now, we

124

account for two different kinds of immune response, as follows.

125

•

Simple response: In this scenario, one bout of infection renders a person insusceptible

126

to fresh infection for a time τ0 days (τ0 much greater than τ1 and τ2) following

127

recovery, after which s/he again turns susceptible to the disease in its original form.

128

•

Complex response: In this scenario, adapted from Lavine et. al. (2020), a person is

129

initially susceptible to the current, highly virulent form of the disease. The first bout

130

of infection renders him/her completely insusceptible for τ0 days following recovery,

131

after which s/he turns susceptible to a lower virulence form of the disease. If infected

132

the second time, then s/he becomes permanently insusceptible to further infection.

133

As is customary in lumped parameter or compartmental models, the value of τ0 used in the

134

model must be an average over the entire population. The experiences of the first few

135

confirmed reinfections may well indicate a general trend favouring the second immune

136

response to the first; in the absence of data, we shall work with both assumptions.

137

It can be shown (Section 2 of the Supplementary Material) that with the simple immune

138

response, the dynamics of the disease is governed by the DDE

With the complex immune response, we need two dependent variables : y(t), the cumulative

141

number of cases of the high virulence form and z(t), the cumulative number of cases of the

142

lower virulence form. We let μ1a and μ1b (presumably greater than μ1a) be the asymptomatic

fractions for the two forms and keep all other parameters identical for both. Then, the

For both models, we present the solutions in a Notional City having an initial susceptible

151

population of N=3,00,000 (the epidemic durations and case trajectory shapes are almost

152

independent of N and the case counts scale as N for large N) and 80 percent asymptomatic

153

carriers i.e. μ1=0·8 (or μ1a=0·8 if appropriate) in the current, high virulence form of the

154

disease. We let μ1b=0·95 for the lower virulence form and take the immunity duration τ0 to be

155

200 days. We solve the equations numerically in Matlab using 2nd order Runge Kutta method

156

with step size 0·001 day. The initial condition function we take is zero cases for the first 193

157

days followed by linear growth of cases at 100 cases/day for the next seven days (with the

158

complex immune response, this growth refers to the high virulence cases – the lower

159

virulence cases remain zero). We take t=0 to be the 194th day of the initial condition period.

160

One issue needs special mention – in a numerical simulation, the case rate will never be

161

identically zero but will be something like 0·001 cases/day (or machine epsilon cases/day).

162

This can pose a serious problem in a situation where there are potential second waves of the

163

epidemic. To circumvent this issue, we have arranged for manual termination of the run if the

164

case rate becomes sufficiently low. Defining the number of active cases at time t to be

165

y(t)−y(t−14), we stop the run if there is less than one active case for 14 consecutive days.

166

While the number 14 (twice) may be somewhat arbitrary, the criterion of a low enough active

167

case count for a long enough period is a very reasonable indicator of the true end of the

168

outbreak. We run all simulations either upto t=1400 days or until they terminate, whichever is

169

earlier.

170
171

Results

172

All results in this Section are based on an assumed immunity period of 200 days. The exact

173

value is not of the greatest significance; as we shall see, the important thing is whether this

174

period is shorter or longer than the evolution of the outbreak with permanent immunity. Six

175

different solution classes corresponding to different parameter values – labelled as Notional

176

Cities A through F – of the model with permanent immunity have been derived in References

177

[26,27] and recapitulated in Section 1 of the Supplementary Material. We shall consider the

178

same Cities in the present analysis.

181

Scenario 1 : Simple immune response

182

We first consider the simple immune response, modelled by (1). Notional City A has

183

m0=0·23 and μ3=0.5, which, with permanent immunity, resulted in the epidemic’s being

184

driven monotonically to containment in 120 days. With the simple immune response, the

185

time-trace of the disease is shown in Figure 1 below. Here and henceforth, we show three

186

things in the same plot : y(t) as a blue line, its derivative as a green line and the “epi-curve” or

187

weekly increments in cases scaled down by a factor of 7, in grey bars.

188
189

Figure 1: City A eliminates the epidemic via non-pharmaceutical interventions alone.

190

The response remains the same as it was with permanent immunity. Next, we present City C,

191

which has μ3=3/4 and m0=0·5 all the time. (We use 0·23 for a “low” value of m0 since we

192

obtained it from data fits in References [26,27]; the chosen “high” value of m0=0·5 generates

193

90 percent infection level at the end of the outbreak.) With the simple immune response, the

194

trajectory is shown in Figure 2 below.

199

Once again, there is no change in behaviour from the permanent immunity case. City B has

200

m0=0·23 like City A but μ3=3/4 like City C. With permanent immunity, City B crawls up to

201

about 26 percent infection level over a period of 220 days. Here however, the 220-day run

202

becomes longer than the assumed immunity duration of 200 days, and the result, now labelled

203

as City B1, is shown in Figure 3.

206
207

Figure 3: City B1 (we shall use B2 to denote the same city with complex immune response) is a less

208

effective form of A and has multiple waves of COVID-19. ‘k’ denotes thousand and ‘L’ hundred

209

thousand. We have stopped the simulation at 1400 days – the waves persist after that time as well.

210

We can see wave after wave of outbreaks here. While we do not believe that the disease can

211

really run unmitigated for four years, the long simulation runtime shows the perfect

212

periodicity of the case trajectories. The case count at the end of the run is greater than the

213

city’s initial susceptible population, so at least some people have been infected at least twice.

214

Cities D and E of References [26,27] were similar to C and A respectively and again, they do

215

not show any change when the new immune response is incorporated. City F, which

216

demonstrates reopening-induced second waves, is more interesting. We start off this City

217

with the parameter values of B, on a path to multiple waves. One hundred and fifty days into

218

the outbreak it reopens completely, raising m0 to 0·5, aiming to infect its entire population

219

before immunity runs out. The result is shown in Figure 4.

221

Figure 4: City F is bold and “beats the virus to the finish line”. ‘k’ denotes thousand and ‘L’ hundred

222

thousand.

223

Howsoever controversial this strategy might appear, it works. The reopening generates an

224

immediate second wave but it does succeed in making the epidemic vanish completely at 210

225

days and 2,46,000 infections. This strategy however has an unhappy variant. City G, instead

226

of reopening at one shot, increases m0 linearly from 0·23 to 0·50 over the interval from 150 to

227

250 days. The resulting infection profile is shown in Figure 5.

231

There are three separate waves of infections here, each more severe than the first, and the

232

cumulative case count exceeds 150 percent of the total population.

233

Scenario 2 : Complex immune response

234
235

We now consider the complex immune response, modelled by (2). Numerical work confirms

236

our expectation that Cities A, C and F will show no difference from the simple immune

237

response case since the epidemic terminates before the immunity duration lapses. We focus

238

on City B, now renamed to B2. For this plot, the colour legend will be y in blue, y in green, z

239

in red, z in magenta and the epi-curves in grey for y and cyan for z. The results are in Figure

Discussion

258

The difference between the cities A, B and C lies in their reproduction number R, which is

259

proportional to m0 if other parameters are held constant. City A has the starting value

260

R0=0·886, City B has R0=1·16, and City C has R0=2·5. With permanent immunity, a low but

261

greater-than-unity R0 leads to a long epidemic duration with a lower caseload, while high R0

262

leads to a shorter duration with a higher caseload. The latter carries a significant risk of

263

overwhelming healthcare facilities and causing unnecessary deaths. With temporary

264

immunity however, we see multiple waves of disease if the cutoff interval τ0 becomes less

265

than the evolution time with permanent immunity (Supplement, Section 3 contains some

266

pedagogical examples that motivate these findings).

267

In this example, we took τ0 to be 200 days, which is towards the longer end of the free

268

evolution duration with time-independent parameters (with time-dependent parameters like

269

periodic lockdown, the epidemic durations can become much longer). Hence we see the wave

270

solutions in a small region of parameter space – we find that with the simple immune

271

response, for all parameters except m0 being held to their City B values, a containment (City

272

A) solution for low m0 gives way to a multiple wave (City B1) solution as m0 is increased

273

above 0·20, while that cedes to a one-shot logistic-like (City C) solution at m0=0·25 and

274

higher. A shorter immunity duration would have caused multiple waves over a larger range of

275

m0. In our example, the waves are close to sinusoidal near m0=0·20; as m0 is increased, the

276

crests get higher and narrower and the troughs lower and wider. From a public health

277

perspective, a low and wide trough might be an opportunity to intensify test-trace-treat efforts

278

and stamp the disease out. With the complex immune response, the total numbers of cases are

279

bounded by 3,00,000 infections of both y and z. Hence, the infinitely periodic waves are no

280

longer possible – they keep attenuating in size before the epidemic terminates outright. In

281

both Cities B and G, the time interval between successive waves appears to be in the range

282

1·5τ0 to 2τ0. Cities F and G show the possible scenarios with reopening. In Table 1, we

283

summarize the different case trajectories possible for different values of R with three kinds of

284

immune response – permanent, simple and complex.

290

temporary immunity. The former is caused by more susceptible people getting exposed and

291

infected, as in the second wave of City F, while the latter is caused by recovered cases

292

turning re-susceptible and thus increasing the size of the susceptible pool, like the waves in

293

City B1. The waves in City G1 are of both types, with the second wave being of the former

294

type and the third of the latter. This is why in City G2 (Figure 7), where previously infected

295

people suffer a “different” disease, the second wave occurs primarily in the high virulence

296

form while the third occurs in the lower virulence form. The phenomenon we are currently

297

seeing in European countries and elsewhere is overwhelmingly the result of weakening of

298

public health intervention measures and not of immunity having run out. We are unsure as to

299

what factors governed the successive waves of the deadly 1918-9 influenza pandemic and

300

how that disease eventually ended.

301

Briefly revisiting the prior Literature, we find that some prior works (Giordano et. al.,

302

Bjornstad et. al. 2020, Cooke et. al. 1996, Travicki 2017, Kiran et. al. 2020) appear to have

303

missed the multiple wave solutions possible with temporary immunity. While Kosinski

304

(2020) and Sandmann et. al. (2020) do find these waves, they do not obtain the diverse

305

possible epidemic trajectories depending on R. Since R is governed by public health

306

interventions, our analysis reveals a subtle interconnection between immunity and public

307

health, which together influence the fate of the pandemic. In Section 3 of the Supplementary

308

Material, we have explained why we find the present results to be more realistic. Finally, we

309

have never seen an S-E-I-R framework being used to model a situation such as the complex

310

immune response where a person can be infected exactly twice but not more.

311

Some of the limitations of the present study are the natural constraints associated with any

312

compartmental or lumped parameter model. For example, the immunity duration used in the

313

model has to be an average over the entire population, which can be refined to some degree

314

by introducing age- or vulnerability-structuring (Sandmann et. al. op. cit). When there are
17

315

very few cases in a region, the lumped parameter model will no longer be valid. The actual

316

end of the outbreak will be determined by the testing, tracing and treatment of each individual

317

case. Another limitation arises from the current lack of knowledge regarding the human

318

immune response to the new pathogen SARS-CoV-2. Here we have assumed two (plausible)

319

kinds of response, one where immunity completely lapses after a given timeframe and the

320

second where severity-reducing immunity persists indefinitely. Future work may reveal the

321

actual immune response to be more complex than either of these assumptions. Moreover, at

322

least six strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified to date (Mercatelli et. al. 2020). At

323

present, we know little about the spreading dynamics of individual strains (Zhang et. al.

324

2020) and still less about the degree of cross-immunity provided by one strain against

325

another.

326

In this variability however also lies our model’s primary strength. The model structure makes

327

it easy to incorporate any kind of immune response (Shayak and Mohit 2020). The

328

computational requirement is negligible, with the run for each Notional City taking about one

329

second on a personal computer. Yet, the model is quite powerful since it can generate diverse

330

classes of solutions which are beyond the scope of other models. This means that the moment

331

more information regarding the immune response becomes known, the new information can

332

be encoded into the model framework and accurate case trajectories predicted forthwith. Our

333

analysis will also be of considerable value in calculating the epidemic dynamics after a

334

vaccine is released and mass vaccination is initiated. We shall wait for such an analysis until

335

a vaccine release is imminent or confirmed, since, by that time much more information

336

regarding the immune response to infection and vaccination will be fact instead of

337

speculation.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL for “Impact of reproduction
number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with
temporary immunity : a mathematical model”
by

B Shayak, Mohit M Sharma, Manas Gaur and Anand Kumar Mishra
In this Supplement we cover three topics not included in the article proper. The first is a brief
recapitulation of our prior work [S1,S2] where we derive the modeling philosophy and show
six different solution classes obtained with permanent immunity rather than temporary. The
second is a derivation of the model equations (1) and (2) of the article proper. The third is a
logic-based explanation for some of the counter-intuitive solutions we report in the article
proper.

1 Recapitulation of our prior study
The philosophy behind the delay differential equation model has been proposed in References
[S1] and [S2] of this Supplement (cited as References [26,27] in the article proper). We start
by summarizing the model derivation and then present the solution classes obtained in these
References. This is necessary because the core contribution of the present article adapts this
derivation and starts from the same solution classes.

Derivation
The transmission of COVID-19 arises as a result of interactions between cases at large in
society and healthy people. These interactions may be either direct or via objects. It is
described by the following “word equation” :

 Rate of emergence
 of new cases


  Spreading rate of   Probability of   Number of 
 =  each at large case    susceptibility    at large cases  , (S0)
 
 
 


which we intend to represent mathematically.
The first term on the above right hand side (RHS) is itself the product of two quantities : the
rate q0 at which each at large case interacts with other people, and the probability P0 that an
interaction between a case and a susceptible person actually results in a transmission. q0 is
determined by the level of social mobility (lockdown/unlock) and by the degree of physical
separation being practised; P0 depends on whether either or both parties are wearing masks
and whether they are washing hands, not touching their face, sanitizing objects etc. Both q0
and P0 depend directly on public health interventions, so we can combine them into a single
term m0 which represents this aspect of the disease.
The second term on the RHS of (S0) is the probability that the person with whom the at large
case interacts, i.e. a random person in the region, is actually susceptible. For now we consider
the case where immunity is permanent. In this case, the probability of a random person’s
being insusceptible is the total number of recovered cases divided by the total number of

people in the region. The former is approximately y, and the latter is N. The recovery count is
actually a little less than y since cases take a finite time to recover. But if the recovery
duration is much shorter than the overall epidemic duration, which it is in practice, then we
can make the assumption of instantaneous recovery and treat it as y. With this assumption,
the probability of a random person’s being insusceptible is y/N and the probability of his/her
being susceptible is 1−y/N.
The structure of the third term arises from the following argument : if all cases take a time τ
days to recover, and remain at large the whole time, then the number of at large active cases
now is exactly the number of people who fell sick between now and τ days back –
mathematically, this is expressed as y(t)−y(t−τ). For a maximally realistic picture, we partion
the cases into three classes : contact traced cases, untraced symptomatic cases and untraced
asymptomatic cases. By definition of the model parameters, the first class amount to fraction
1−μ3 of the total cases; if the contact tracing starts from freshly reporting symptomatic cases,
then the average duration these cases remain at large is τ2/2 where τ2 is the transmissible
latency period. Untraced symptomatic cases account for fraction μ3(1−μ1) of the total cases
and they remain at large for the latency period τ2 before manifesting symptoms and going into
quarantine. Finally, untraced asymptomatic cases account for fraction μ3μ1 of the total cases
and these remain at large for the asymptomatic infection period τ1. Using the y(t)−y(t−τ)
argument on each class leads to the mathematical form of the third term on the RHS of (S0)
as

n = (1 − μ3 )( y − y (t − τ 2 / 2) ) + ( (1 − μ1 ) μ3 )( y − y (t − τ 2 ) ) + μ1 μ3 ( y − y (t − τ1 ) ) . (S1)
Multiplying all the terms on the RHS of (S0) and simplifying the algebra in (S1), we get

which is the retarded logistic equation proposed in References [S1,S2]. For further details
regarding the derivation of (S2), including justification of the approximations involved, we
must refer to [S1,S2].

Solution classes
Here we present the six solution classes to the model which we have found in [S1,S2], and
which form the basis for the solution classes considered in the article proper. For each class,
we have run the model in a Notional City of initial susceptible population 3,00,000 as we
have done in the article proper. As in there, for each plot we show y in blue, y in green and
the epidemiological curve as grey bars.
The first solution class, City A, corresponds to elimination of the disease via nonpharmaceutical interventions alone. Reduction of social interactions, masking, contact
tracing, testing and similar measures ensure that the reproduction number R is less than unity
at the start of the outbreak (we have taken it as 0·89 in this particular example) and remains
so throughout. Such situations have occurred in New Zealand and Australia.

Figure S1 : City A contains the epidemic in time.

The second solution class, City B, features non-pharmaceutical interventions at a lower level
than City A, which ensures that R0=1·15. Initially, the outbreak grows exponentially, but then
evolves more slowly and infects less than 30 percent of the population by the time it ends.
This class of solution (at least in part) has been seen in many regions of the world, such as the
cities of Mumbai in India and Buenos Aires in Argentina.

Figure S2 : City B has a classical bell-shaped epi-curve.

The third class, City C, attempts no interventions at all. R starts off at above 2·5 and remains
high throughout until herd immunity is attained. There is very high case count in a very short
time. This type of solution has not been seen anywhere in the real world since no local or
national authority is so negligent as to adopt a do-nothing course of action.

Figure S3 : City C proceeds quickly to herd immunity.

The fourth class, City D, shows the effects of a late lockdown. Beginning like City C, this
city imposes restrictions at the level of City B when the case count becomes 40,000. The
solution combines features of Cities B and C – both the case count and the epidemic duration
are intermediate between the two extremes. The first wave of COVID-19 in New York City,
USA was of this type.

Figure S4 : City D combines features of B and C.

Finally, Cities E and F demonstrate reopening. Both start off like City A and then reopen on
the 80th day. City E is a success story where increased mobility is combined with high contact
tracing, testing etc to keep R < 1 throughout. Such reopenings may have taken place in certain
East Asian countries.

Figure 5 : City E is similar to A despite reopening.

City F is a failure story where the increased mobility results in R exceeding unity and there is
a wave of disease after the 80th day. Reopening driven second waves (with the first wave
resembling City B rather than A) have been seen in many parts of the world, especially in
USA and Western Europe.

Figure S6 : City F shows reopening gone wrong.
This completes the recapitulation of our prior study [S1,S2]. We note that our model, and
hence the results of Cities A through G, are more appropriate for an individual city or even a
neighbourhood rather than an entire country. This is because the model assumes good
interaction among the region’s inhabitants – this assumption is unlikely to hold for a country
as a whole, especially under the present circumstances. Rather, a country is made up of
dozens of these A-G type cities and the final curve of cumulative cases for this country will
be a superposition of the different infection profiles of these cities. Hence, on a national level,
public health officials should not attempt to formulate uniform epidemic policies for the
country as a whole. It is not uncommon that a phenomenon observed in one region may not
be observed somewhere else.

2 Development of the model
We now use the modeling philosophy outlined above to derive the governing equations
presented in the article proper. We briefly recapitulate the two kinds of immune response
from the article proper. Simple immune response : After contracting the infection, a person
remains insusceptible for τ0 days following recovery and then becomes susceptible again.
Complex immune response : After contracting the infection, a person remains insusceptible
for τ0 days, then becomes susceptible to the lower virulence form and after a second infection
becomes permanently immune.
We first consider the simple immune response. In the structure (S0), immune response is
modelled by the second term on the RHS, so that is the only term which will be different
from (S2). The immunity threshold of τ0 means that at any given instant, the people who are
immune are all those who have contracted the infection during the last τ0 days, and no one
else. Hence, the number of insusceptibles at time t is exactly the number of new infections
which have occurred between time t−τ0 and t, which is y(t)−y(t−τ0). In proposing this
structure, we have retained the approximation of instantaneous recovery and also have
ignored deaths. Since the mortality rate of COVID-19 is fortunately quite low, this second
assumption is reasonable as well. So the probability that at time t, a random person is
insusceptible is [y−y(t−τ0)]/N, and the probability that s/he is susceptible is its complement,
P =1−

y (t ) − y (t − τ 0 )

. (S3)

Using this in (S0) immediately gives

which is (1) of the article proper.
With complex immune response, we need to write the structure (S0) for both y and z. The
public health term m0 remains the same for both. In the y-equation, the second term must
denote the probability that a random person is susceptible to the high virulence form. As
before, let us count the insusceptibles. Any person who has contracted the high virulence
form once is insusceptible to it for all future time, so the number of insusceptibles is y and the
probability of susceptibility is 1−y/N. For the third term, we need the total numbers of active
and at large y as well as z, which is (S1) written out for both y and z. Thus, we get

(S5)

which is (2a) of the article proper.
For the z equation, the per-case spreading rate as well as the number of spreaders remain
unchanged; the only thing which changes is the probability that a random person is
susceptible to the lower virulence form. At time t, the only people eligible for contracting the
lower virulence disease are those who have already contracted the high virulence form once,
and that a time τ0 or more ago. This is the cumulative number of high virulence infections at
time t−τ0, which is y(t−τ0). Among these eligible people however, the current count z(t) have

3 Qualitative motivation and explanation of the solutions
The different solution classes of (1) and (2) we saw in the article proper are quite counterintuitive so we motivate them here through some pedagogical examples. We had used one
such example in an earlier work [S3] to motivate the City A containment solution, which we
now recapitulate briefly. This example was the fantasy kingdom of Coronaland where the
king declares a 28-day “100 percent lockdown” – literally nobody is allowed to step out of
his/her house. Because Coronaland is fictitious, this does not pose a logistical problem of
survival. At the end of the lockdown, every case has either recovered or died at home, and the
virus does not exist any longer when normal life is restarted. City A of the article proper is
the real-world version of Coronaland since the philosophy is the same – with skilful public
health measures, the virus is fed new patients at such a small rate that it itself gets annihilated
in time.
The pedagogical examples relevant for temporary immunity are the following. The fictitious
city of Coronapur (alla Kanpur, Saharanpur) has an initial population of 500 susceptible
people, and has zero cases to start with. The duration of immunity is 200 days and every case
recovers within a day (consistent with the modeling assumption above). The spread of the
virus here is governed by the following simple rule :
•
•

On any day if there are 5 or more than 5 susceptible individuals present, then exactly
5 of them (randomly selected where necessary) contract the virus
On any day if there are less than 5 susceptible individuals present then all of them
contract the virus

We recall that this is a pedagogical example and not a real-world epidemic spreading
dynamic ! The case trajectory of Coronapur is simple enough to predict. There are total 5
cases on day 1, 10 on day 2, 15 on day 3 and so on, all the way upto 500 on day 100. Then,
since the first batch of cases is still well within its immunity period, there are no more
susceptible people left and the propagation stops. On day 100, the last batch of cases also
clears the virus which then does not exist in Coronapur any longer. Everyone has been
infected but the virus is dead and the epidemic over.
The fantasy city of Coronabad (alla Hyderabad, Allahabad) has everything same as
Coronapur except that the number 5 is replaced by 2. The case trajectory starts off with 2
cases on the first day, 4 on the second, 6 on the third, 200 on the 100th (unlike the 500 of
Coronapur) and so on upto 400 cases on the 200th day. Thus, on day 201, there are 100 people

who are yet to contract the infection. But, on this day, the cases of day 1 lose their immunity
and also get added to the susceptible pool. So the two new infections of day 201 can be
anyone from this pool of 102. Similarly on day 202, the two cases from day 201 get removed
from the susceptible pool but the two recoveries from day 2 get added and the pool size does
not change. This scenario remains invariant for all time – every day there is a susceptible
pool of 102 and every day there are 2 new infections from amongst this pool. Even though
the initial growth rate is much slower than in Coronapur, the city of Coronabad becomes a
land of immortal virus.
The above is exactly what we see in the solutions of (1) and (2). Just as City A is a realistic
version of Coronaland, Cities C (also F) and B are realistic versions of Coronapur and
Coronabad respectively. A high R as in Cities C and F leads to a fast spreading of the
epidemic with high initial case counts but puts the progress of the disease to a stop in time. A
lower R (but of course greater than unity) as in City B leads to slower spreading with lower
initial case counts but the disease keeps on perpetuating itself. These examples help us to
qualitatively understand the solutions and also convince us that our results are a more
accurate representation of reality than literature items (indicated in the article proper) which
do not find this complex dependence on R.
