Abstract

14

COVID-19 is now in an epidemic phase, with a second outbreak likely to appear

15

at any time. The intensity and timing of a second outbreak is a common concern

16

worldwide. In this study, we made scenario projections of the potential second

17

outbreak of COVID-19 using a statistical-epidemiology model, which considers both

18

the impact of seasonal changes in meteorological elements and human social

19

behaviors such as protests and city unblocking. Recent street protests in the United

20

States and other countries are identified as a hidden trigger and amplifier of the

21

second outbreak. The scale and intensity of subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks in the

22

U.S. cities where the epidemic is under initial control are projected to be much greater

23

than those of the first outbreak. For countries without reported protests, lifting the

24

COVID-19 related restrictions prematurely would accelerate the spread of the disease

25

and place mounting pressure on the local medical system that is already overloaded.

26

We anticipate these projections will support public health planning and policymaking

27

by governments and international organizations.

1 Introduction

29

Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly and poses a dire threat to global

30

public health, which claimed over 0.49 million lives, along with 9.8 million confirmed

31

cases as of June 28th 1. Beyond the spread itself, the outbreak may have far-reaching

32

consequences, negatively affecting the economic development worldwide and posing a

33

series of long-standing social problems2,3. There is an urgent need for a global prediction

34

system that can provide scientific guidelines for the World Health Organization and

35

international decision-makers to implement effective containment measures capable of

36

curbing the spread of COVID-194. Researchers worldwide have developed various models

37

with mathematical and statistical methods, including stochastic simulations, lognormal

38

distribution5,

39

susceptible-infectious-removed infectious disease model (SIR) is the most widely used7â€“9.

40

However, this simple model is built under a series of idealized assumptions, which may

41

limit the accuracy and reliability of the prediction. In order to obtain the prediction results

42

with higher credibility, more complex models with fewer assumptions should be developed

43

so as to simulate the actual situations in a more realistic manner10.

44

Although it is difficult to establish an accurate epidemiological model describing the

45

spread of a pandemic, the reported global pandemic data contain particular solutions to the

46

mathematical equations incorporated in epidemiological models3,6. It is theoretically

47

possible to remedy the defects of prior epidemiological models by introducing the latest

48

pandemic data and hence improve the pandemic prediction2,4,6. Based on this idea, we have

49

developed a Global Prediction System of the COVID-19 Pandemic (GPCP)11. The system

50

develops a modified version of the SIR model and determines the parameters through

51

historical data fitting12,13, which allows it to make targeted predictions for various countries

52

and obtain better prediction results. The first version of GPCP (CPCP-1) can capture the

53

major features of the daily number of confirmed new cases and provides reliable

54

predictions. However, the prediction of GPCP-1 is only valid for one month11.

55

In this study, the second version of the Global Prediction System for COVID-19

56

Pandemic (GPCP-2) is developed based on a modified SEIR model14. The system considers

57

both the seasonal changes of meteorological elements and human social behaviors

58

including protests and city unblocking. The paper is arranged as follows: the details of the

59

datasets and the methodology used are given in section 2. In section 3, projections of 12

60

cities in the United States are presented. The projections of 15 countries with reported

61

protests and 15 countries without reported protests are shown in section 4 and section 5,

62

respectively. Discussion and conclusion are presented in section 6.

2 Method

64

2.1 The modified SEIR model

65

The second version of Global Prediction System for COVID-19 Pandemic (GPCP) is

66

built based on a modified SEIR model15. The traditional SEIR model10,14 defines seven

67

states of the disease: susceptible cases (S), insusceptible cases (P), potentially infected

68

cases (E, infected cases in a latent period), infectious cases (I, infected cases that have not

69

been quarantined), quarantined cases (Q, confirmed and quarantined cases), recovered

70

cases (R), and cases of mortality (D). The SEIR model is able to emulate the time curve of

71

an outbreak. The model is consisted of the following equations:

81

We modified the model by introducing the timing of community reopening collected

82

from news reports. If the timing collected from news reports is not explicit enough as an

83

input to our model, the timing will be indicated by the daily new cases on the day of

84

reopening (dQc). As the number of newly confirmed cases on a given day falls lower than

85

dQc, local authority begins to lift or loose the lockdowns.

86

In addition, the temporal variation of transmission rate due to changes in local

87

temperature as well as human behaviors are considered. Generally, the transmission rate

88

( ) can be expressed by the following equations:

94

infection rate.    is the PDF function obtained by Huang et al.16, who found that 60.0%

95

of confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from

96

5Â°C to 15Â°C. Using the NCEP reanalysis data, we calculated the global distribution of

97

probability distribution function (PDF) values on each day of the year and included its

98

influence on the infection rate. Figure 1 shows the PDF values for the four seasons in a year.

99

High PDF values correspond to the ambient temperature that is conducive for the virus to

100

spread. For the northern hemisphere, the optimal band generally moves northward in

101

summer (June, July, and August) and moves southward in winter (December, January, and

102

February), while for southern hemisphere the optimal band moves southward in summer

103

(December, January, and February) and moves northward in winter (June, July, and

104

August).

122

algorithm17. This method inserts a damping coefficient into the Gauss-Newton method

123

when calculating the Hessian matrix. The benefit of introducing this damping coefficient is

124

that it can converge very quickly in the steepest direction in many cases even when the

125

initial solution is very far from ideal values, which makes the parameter determination

126

more robust18. In addition, for all damping coefficient greater than 0, the coefficient matrix

127

is positive definite which makes the Hessian matrix in the descending direction. The input

128

variables to obtain fitted parameters ( , , , , , and  ) are the time series of confirmed

129

(    ), death (), and recovered () cases provided by from Johns

130

Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering1. The equations are solved

131

using the classic 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

132

3 Projections of the US cities

133

Unfortunately, the recent protests against police violence in cities across the United

134

States have gone ahead despite the current rising COVID-19 pandemic and potential

135

subsequent outbreaks, possibly with higher intensity. Large public gatherings, shouting, and

136

marching shoulder to shoulder may have already sown the seeds of the second outbreaks in

137

regions under initial control19,20 and made it even more difficult to contain the epidemic in

138

regions where the curve is still increasing. The use of tear gas and pepper spray against the

139

protesters may also have produced violent coughing and runny noses, forcing protesters to

140

remove their masks and making the crowds even more susceptible to the virus. A certain

141

number of patients with the latent disease may have participated in the protests and spread

142

the disease to healthy protesters, police officers, and national guards who are not yet

143

immune to the virus21. If the close contacts of the infectious are not fully tracked, they may

144

spread the virus to other groups of people, increasing the risk of a larger size of outbreaks.

145

Here, we simulated the impact of large-scale protests on the potential second outbreaks in

146

several cities of the United States22 (Figure 2 and Table 1). The model generally predicted a

147

second wave of COVID-19 in the second half of 2020. We estimated the increase in the

148

population of potentially infected people (Î´Et) for each city based on the ratio of the

149

number of infected persons (Qt) to the total population of the city (N). The timing of

150

protests and the number of protesters in each city were collected from local news reports

151

(Table 1). The increase in the population of potentially infected people (Î´Et) and the

152

populations of protesters (Î´St, regarded as an increase in the population of susceptible)

153

were used as the force input for the model calculations to simulate the impact of protests on

154

the outbreaks. When the protests begin, we force group E and group S to increase Î´Et and

155

Î´St, respectively.

Scenario 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. (a)~(b) and (c)~(d) are the simulations with seasonal
forcing; (e)~(f) and (g)~(h) are the simulations without seasonal forcing. (a)~(b) and (e)~(f)
are the simulations where the restrictions are completely lifted; (c)~(d) and (g)~(h) are the
simulations where the restrictions are partially lifted.

166

Figure 2 shows the projections for Minneapolis in 8 scenarios (4 scenarios with protests

167

and 4 without). After the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, an upward trend of daily new

168

cases has been observed. The protests would significantly amplify the intensity of the

169

second outbreak but may not be able to advance it. In scenarios 1, the second outbreak of

170

Minneapolis will peak in mid-August 2020. The comparison between scenarios indicates

171

that the effect of intervention measures outweighs the seasonal forcing. For the rest of the

172

12 cities, the model also predicted enhanced second outbreaks when the impact of protests

173

is considered (Table 1). Due to space constraints, the details of the projection results are not

174

impact of protests, when the restrictions are lifted completely, a second wave with a peak of

190

191

The protests and the lifting of restrictions, along with the enhancement in the ability of virus

192

transmission in the cold seasons due to temperature change may cause the recurrence of an

193

outbreak that was initially under control. If the same intervention measures are implemented

194

during the second outbreak, the second outbreak would be brought under control again by the

end of 2020.

Figure 4: Projections of the second outbreak in India in different scenarios. Scenarios 1
and 2 are simulated with seasonal forcing, while scenarios 3 and 4 are simulated without
seasonal forcing. Scenarios 1 and 3 are the projections where restrictions are fully lifted,
while scenarios 2 and 4 are the projections where restrictions are partially lifted.

204

Mass gathering events during the epidemic should be restricted or even banned since

205

they have the potential to enhance the second outbreak and pose further radical

206

public-health challenges for health authorities and governments23,24. Lifting the restrictions

207

too early may also have the potential to trigger subsequent outbreaks and further increase

208

the pressure on the medical system. Fig 4 shows the projections of India in the four

209

scenarios. With seasonal forcing, it is predicted that the first peak of the epidemic will

210

occur in September while the second peak with higher intensity, caused environmental

211

changes, will arrive in January 2021. Without seasonal forcing, there would be only one

212

peak in September 2020. We also projected the epidemic curve for other countries

213

including Russia, Brazil, Chile, etc. that are still in the rapid growing period. We classified

214

them as â€˜non-protesting countriesâ€™, not because there are no protests. Indeed, there might

215

have been many protests and mass gatherings in India, Brazil, and other regions that may

216

impact the outbreak on varying degrees, but the information on the timing and size of these

217

protests are currently not available. Therefore, the role of these protests on the timing and

218

size of the outbreaks can not be isolated and may not be incorporated as a force into the

219

model.

220

From Table 3 we can see that the peak time and size of the second outbreak varies from

221

countries to countries, due to different levels of interventions measures, environmental

222

conditions, medical resources, etc. Regions with high population density are at higher risk

223

of enhanced second outbreaks. When control measures are lifted too soon and

224

environmental temperatures are more suitable for the spread of disease25, an enhanced

225

second outbreak is expected. Therefore, when considering the timing of lifting the

226

restrictions to restore the economy, it is necessary to analyze epidemic situations as well as

227

climate factors. For example, during cold seasons when the transmission rate is higher,

228

reopening would easily light up the second outbreaks, since conducive environmental

229

factors and related human social behaviors (more frequent indoor gatherings) would,

230

directly and indirectly, increase the transmission ability of the virus, leaving more people

231

vulnerable to infection. Therefore, the peak of the second wave of the outbreak is most

232

likely to synchronize with the fall of environmental temperature, displaying strong

233

seasonality. During winter months, the temperate regions of the Northern and Southern

234

Hemispheres experience highly synchronized annual influenza epidemics26. Additionally,

235

when restrictions are lifted, personal protection (wearing face masks, keeping appropriate

236

interpersonal distance, sterilization, etc)27. is still required or even mandatory in indoor

237

places so as to minimize the infection rate by cutting off the infection routine.

6 Discussion and conclusion

240

New treatments and vaccines are not yet available for any COVID-19-affected areas28.

241

With the presence asymptomatic of carriers that may spread the virus, and the lack of herd

242

immunity, a second outbreak is inevitable as confirmed cases of COVID-19 increase. Our

243

results show that the timing and intensity of the second outbreaks are seasonally modulated

244

and depend largely on local reopening policies. Higher seasonal variations in COVID-19

245

transmission may lead to a greater incidence of recurrent wintertime outbreaks29. The

246

current mass protests in the United States and other regions of the world could lead to

247

amplified second outbreaks, overlapping the wintertime outbreaks and threatening more

248

lives. This is because the extremely crowded environments facilitate the spread of the virus,

249

leading to high rates of the second attack, as seen in both the 1918 pandemic and the 1957

250

Asian influenza pandemic30â€“32.

251

If the transmission capacity of the second outbreak increases, it could place a

252

catastrophic burden on the health system and create even more serious social and economic

253

crises. However, if the chain of transmission is cut during the first outbreak, there will be

254

no further outbreak similar to the first wave. The necessary drug therapies and vaccines

255

currently require long-term development and testing, so nonpharmaceutical interventions

256

are the only direct means available to suppress the spread of the disease33. In the face of a

257

powerful pandemic, everyone must help to fight the virus. We must collectively follow the

258

distancing limits recommended by global public-health organizations to effectively reduce

259

the potential cost in the lives of the second wave of infection. Our findings should

260

encourage close monitoring and early warning of the development of a global pandemic, as

261

well as safeguards for our global prediction system to best contain the second wave34.

262

These results provide a powerful scientific basis for governments to adjust their policies

263

and control measures in real-time, to achieve the most effective allocation of medical

264

resources before the second outbreak and to reduce the associated health risks.
