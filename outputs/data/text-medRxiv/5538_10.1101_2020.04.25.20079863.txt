Abstract
Background:
The relentless advance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has resulted in a significant burden
on countries, regardless of their socio-economic conditions. The virus has infected more than
2.5 million people worldwide, causing to date more than 150,000 deaths in over 210 countries.
Objective:
The aim of this study was to describe the trends in cases, tests and deaths related to novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.
Methodology:
Data were retrieved from the WHO-Coronavirus Disease (COVID-2019) situation reports and
the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) databases from Johns Hopkins
University. Descriptive statistics including death rates, cumulative mortality and incidence
rates, as well as testing rates per population at risk were performed. A comparison analysis
among countries with ≥50 confirmed cases was performed from February 26th, 2020 to April
8th, 2020.
Results:
Brazil had the greatest number of cases and deaths in the region. Panama experienced a rapid
increase in the number of confirmed cases with Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia and Honduras
having the highest case fatality rates. Panama and Chile conducted more tests per million
inhabitants and more tests per day per million inhabitants, followed by Uruguay and El
Salvador. Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil had the highest positive test rates.
Conclusions:
The COVID-19 disease pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has progressed rapidly in
LAC countries. Some countries have been affected more severely than others, with some
adopting similar disease control methods to help slow down the spread of the virus. With
limited testing and other resources, social distancing is needed to help alleviate the strain on
already stretched health systems.

Background:
Communicable diseases have long been part of our humanity, having an impact on global
population levels, human culture and socialization [1]. Bacterial and viral infections are
responsible for millions of deaths worldwide, with pandemics over history including the black
death, smallpox, cholera, AIDS and influenza-type disease. Recent respiratory disease
outbreaks include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the Middle-East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the latest, the 2019 novel Coronavirus disease (termed
COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus [2]. The current classification of coronaviruses
recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae, of which three
can cause disease in both animals and humans [2, 3]. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with
roughly spherical virions of approximately 60-140nm in diameter [4]. The first genome of
SARS-CoV-2 named Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI reference sequence NC_045512) was isolated and
sequenced in China [4, 5].
On December 31st 2019, a number of atypical pneumonia-like illness cases were reported in
Hubei province, China [6]. On January 10th, through genetic sequencing, it was confirmed that
this pneumonia was caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Ten days later, the first
confirmed cases outside mainland China occurred in Japan, South Korea and Thailand. By the
end of January, at least 17 people had died and more than 570 others had been infected
worldwide [6, 7]. After only three months, on March 11th, the staggering number of cases led
the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring the outbreak a pandemic [8] and since then,
its distribution has been relentless, infecting more than 2.2 million people and killing more than
150,000 people worldwide [9].
The virus spread first in Asia, then to Europe and North America and finally made its way to
South America and Africa. The impact of the atypical respiratory disease has already put
substantial pressure on health systems globally [10–12]. This pressure is due to the percentage
of patients who require hospitalization and the speed at which symptoms can worsen [6]. For
Latin America, early cases were able to be managed, however as the number of cases rose,
countries with little investment into public health struggled to control the number of cases. The
first country to confirm a COVID-19 case in Latin America was Brazil, followed by Mexico
and later Ecuador. All Latin American countries have reported the disease at the time of writing
[9].

The aim of this study was to describe the trends of COVID-19 in each Latin American and the
Caribbean (LAC) countries through the calculation of different rates that reflect the reality of
each one. These were then compared with the rates seen in China and Italy recorded up until
April, 8th 2020.
Material and Methods
Study Design
A descriptive observational study using secondary international reports was carried out for all
Latin American and Caribbean countries from February 26th, 2020 to April 8th, 2020 that
showed more than 50 confirmed cases by April 8th. Furthermore, China for being the first
country to report cases, and Italy for being the European country with highest mortality
reported, were added to the analysis from January 21st, 2020 to April 8th, 2020 as comparison
models.
Source of Data
Secondary data was retrieved from the three main publicly available databases that are
publishing information about COVID-19. We use the daily reports from WHO-Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19) situation reports [13], the Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE)

at

Johns

Hopkins

University

[14]

and

the

on-line

data

repository

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data [15].
Sequences and amino acid replacement of SARS-CoV-2 virus information were retrieved from
the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org/), an
initiative that promotes the international sharing of SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences to better
understand how the novel coronavirus evolves, spreads and how it causes pathology [16, 17]
as well as the CoV-GLUE Project (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home). The CoV-GLUE
Project is a database of amino acid replacements that have been observed in sequences sampled
from the pandemic strain [18]. Lastly, Supplementary Table 1 details the knowledge of all
contributions and laboratories of this study according to GISAID requirement.
Study Size
All confirmed COVID-19 countries with more than fifty cases reported in the region up to
April 8th were included in the analysis.

Bias
To reduce the risk of observer bias, data collection was performed using the triangulation
technique with three researchers of our team. Using this technique described by Carvalho and
White [19], it aided in the reduction of bias as any errors in data collection could be highlighted
through comparison between analysts.
Variables
The number of confirmed cases and deaths attributed to COVID-19 were transformed into
crude and cumulative numbers to obtain cumulative confirmed cases (CCC) and cumulative
confirmed deaths (CCD) per country.
The morbidity and mortality incidence, case-fatality rate, positive-test rate and test performed
were calculated according to the entire population per country.
Statistical Analysis
The rate of cumulative incidence of confirmed cases (CICC) and deaths (CICD) per million
inhabitants was calculated to reflect the impact of the coronavirus for each country using the
population projection for 2020, according to the World Population Prospects 2019 [20].
The case fatality rate (CFR%) and positive test rate (PTR%) with a confidence interval of 95%
for crude rates were computed for each country by April 8th as follow:
!"# (%) = )

*+,-./ 01 20314/,.5 5.67ℎ9

>?# (%) = )

*+,-./ 01 20314/,.5 269.9

For an approach related to the test performed in each country. The influence of population size
was reduced by the calculation of tests per million inhabitants (TMI) and to control time
distribution daily tests per million inhabitants (DTMI) with the formulas:

F?AB = (>./10/,.5 7.979 ÷ 20+37/D @0@+C67403 ÷ 56D9 9432. 14/97 /.@0/7)
× 1,000,000
Additionally, to control the time distribution of cases per population and time since the first
report, the DCMI was calculated:
F!AB = (!0314/,.5 269.9 ÷ 20+37/D @0@+C67403
÷ 56D9 9432. 14/97 /.@0/7) × 1,000,000
Finally, results were grouped as confirmed case-related data (CCC, CICC, DCMI), deathrelated data (CCD, CICD, CFR%) and test-related data (TMI, DTMI and PTR%).
Results
In the first 40 days since the first LAC countries’ report, the number of cases in the region
reached 44,233 with more than 1,770 deaths. The total number of cases reported in the region
until early-April 2020 represents 1% of the total number of confirmed cases worldwide.
Confirmed Case-Related Data Analysis
Cumulative Incidence of Confirmed Cases (CCC)
Most countries in the region have a similar CCC trend compared to Italy. On April 8th, Brazil,
Chile and Ecuador had the highest number of CCC with 16,170 cases, 5,546 cases and 4,450
cases respectively, which correspond to the 42nd, 36th and 38th days since their first report. At
the same time, Honduras, Costa Rica and Venezuela had the lowest reports with 312 cases, 502
cases and 167 cases respectively, which correspond to the 25th, 27th and 31st days since their
first report (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Cumulative of confirmed cases since the first case reported in each country of Latin
America and the Caribbean.
This data was obtained from the daily new cases registered by country as shown in Figure 2,
which demonstrated that most of them reached its highest value on April 8th. For example,
Brazil highest peak was 2,136 cases, followed by Peru (1,388), Ecuador (703), Chile (430) and
Mexico (346) (Figure 2).

Cumulative Incidence of Confirmed Cases per Million Inhabitants (CICC)
The cumulative incidence of confirmed cases reached 10 per million people in Italy at the 37th
day (March 8th) since the first official report of COVID-19, while as a reference, China reported
a plateau of 5 per million inhabitants since the 25th day (February 16th). In this sense, some
Latin American Countries like Panama, Chile and Ecuador show faster trends in confirmed
cases compared to Italy and China (Figure 3).
Panama reached a rate of 10 per million as fast as the 15th day (March 25th) since the first
official report and in only 11 days, this number increased by 300% to a rate of 40 cases per
million people. In the same way, Uruguay had a rapid increase in the incidence rate in only 20
days, reaching 10 cases per million people. Chile reported a slower start with a CICC of 10
cases per one million on the 26th day (March 29th) after its first report, a value that got
duplicated in only 6 days up to 20 cases per million on April 1st. Ecuador reached a CICC of
10 per million on the 27th day (March 28th) of the outbreak, with this figure doubling 13 days
later on April 5th.

Figure 3 Cumulative incidence of confirmed cases per million inhabitants since the first case
reported in each country of Latin America and the Caribbean.
Countries with higher population density had fewer rates including Brazil (6.2 per million),
Mexico (2.1 per million) and Argentina (3.9 per million) inhabitants on the first 40 days after
its first official case was reported in relationship with less populate countries.
Daily Confirmed Cases per Million Inhabitants (DCMI)
On April 8th, Italy reached 34 confirmed cases per million inhabitants (DCMI) daily, 68 days
after its first official report. This number is still lower for Latin-American countries, such as
Panama, that with only 29 days after the initial case had already reached 17.9 daily confirmed
cases per million people, followed by Chile with 8 (36th day), Ecuador 6.6 (38th day), the
Dominican Republic 5.1 (38th day) and Uruguay 4.9 (25th day) (Table 1).
Confirmed Death Case-Related Data Analysis
Cumulative Number of Confirmed Death (CCD)
The number of deaths reached an exponential growth, especially in Italy, reaching 1,809 CCD
after 45 days since its first report. In comparison, cases reported by April 8th in Brazil reaching
819 reports (40th day), while Ecuador topped 242 (38th day), Mexico 141 (40th day), Peru 121
(33rd day) and the Dominican Republic 108 (38th day) (Figure 4).

Cumulative incidence of deaths per million inhabitants (CICD)
In Italy, the cumulative incidence of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants reached 10 death
per million people after 40 days after the first official report (March 11th). Only five days later,
this number duplicated. In contrast, China showed a plateau since the 34th day (February 25th)
after the first case was reported, reaching less than 2.3 deaths per million inhabitants.
In Latin America, countries such as Panama and Ecuador reached 10 deaths per million
inhabitants as fast as the 26th (April 5th) and the 35th day (April 5th) after the first case was
reported, respectively. The Dominican Republic reached 9 cumulative incidence death rate per
million inhabitants on the 38th day (April 8th) after the first case report.
Other countries had a slower start, reaching a lower CICD rate after the 34th day of the initial
report as Chile (2.2 per million), Argentina (1.3 per million), Mexico (1.1 per million) and
Brazil (3.1 per million) on the 34th (April 6th), 35th (April 7th), 39th (April 7th) and 41st (April
7th) days after the initial report, respectively (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Cumulative incidence of confirmed deaths per million inhabitants since the first death
reported in each country of Latin America and the Caribbean.
Case Fatality Rate (CFR%) Analysis.
The fatality rate from COVID-19 in Italy reached 12.6% on the 68th day after the first case
report. During the same time, China had a CFR% a little over 4.03% at 77th day after the initial
report (Table 1).
In Latin-American the computed CFR% ranged from 4% to 7.5% during the initial stage of the
pandemic infection. Trinidad and Tobago has the highest CFR% with 7.48%. Meanwhile, it
was followed by countries like Bolivia (7.14%), Honduras (7.05%) and Ecuador (5.44%). Chile
(0.87%), Uruguay (1.65%) and Costa Rica (0.60%) reported the lowest CFR% within the
region (Table 1).
Table 1 Comparison of CFR%, TMI, DTMI, PTR%, DCMI between China, Italy and the rest
of Latin American and Caribbean countries with more than 50 confirmed cases until April

Testing-Related Data Analysis
Tests per Country per Million Inhabitants
In terms of testing, by April 8th, Italy reported a total of 807,125 performed tests. In addition,
when it was corrected by population level, it demonstrated 13,349 tests performed per million
inhabitants (TMI). In Latin America, the country with the highest number of tests performed
was Chile with 60,391, followed by Brazil with 54,824 (Table 1), Peru with 39,599 and
Colombia with 33,575 (Figure 7). Nevertheless, concerning the number of tests performed by
population, Panama and Chile reported the highest testing rates per million people in the region
(>2,500), followed by Uruguay and Peru with more than 1,200 TMI each. In contrast, Brazil,
Mexico and Ecuador, countries that were the first in reporting COVID-19 cases in the region,
could not reach more than 900 TMI.

Daily Tests per Million People
On January 31st, Italy reported its first case of coronavirus, after 68 days, on April 8th, this
country had reached its highest number of daily tests with at least 196 tests performed in a
single day per one million inhabitants.
In Latin America, some countries kept the number of daily testing close to 100 test per day per
one million people. For instance, Panama performed 94 daily test per one million people,
followed by Chile and Uruguay, countries that have reached at least 90 daily test per one
million people. On the other hand, some countries like the Dominican Republic, Bolivia,
Ecuador and Brazil did not accomplish to reach at least 25 daily test per one million people
(Table 1).
Positive Test Rate (PTR %) Analysis
The ratio between the number of tests and number of tests which resulted positive was analysed
for Italy and Latin-American countries on April 8th. Italy reported a ratio of 17.27% of
confirmed cases from the total tests performed (PTR%). In Latin America, some countries with
highly effective testing strategies such as Chile and Uruguay have reported a positive test ratio
of 9.18% and 7.38%, respectively (Table 1). On the other hand, countries with lower testing
capabilities have reported higher positive testing rates. For instance, Dominican Republic
reported the highest positive rate ,up to April the 8th, with at least 46.4% of the total number of
tests being positive, followed by Bolivia (35.5%), Ecuador (30.9%) and Brazil (29.5%) (Table
1).
SARS-CoV-2 Genomes and Amino Acid Replacements in Latin America
Scientific communities from 52 countries have sequenced 4,347 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and
submitted to GISAID between December 2019 and April 2020. Additionally, the CoV-GLUE
Project has identified 2,334 amino acid replacements, 4 insertions, and 26 deletions. The most
frequent amino acid replacements worldwide were D614G (S glycoprotein), P323L (nsp12),
L84S (ORF8), Q57H (ORF3a), R203K (N phosphoprotein), G204R (N phosphoprotein), L37F
(nsp6), T85I (nsp2), G251V (ORF3a), and Y541C (nsp13) (Figure 8A).
Regarding Latin America, 55 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced and submitted to
GISAID. Brazil analysed 20 genomes finding the ORF1a T708I, ORF1a D1036, ORF1a

Discussion
The Pan-American Health Organization and United Nations announced that Latin American
and Caribbean countries had a slight time advantage on preparation for the coronavirus
pandemic arrival [21, 22] due to the delay in seeing cases arising compared to other locations.
LAC countries have some of the highest urbanization rates in the world, often with unequal
access to public services in urban settings and high mortality rates for transmittable diseases
[23, 24]. In some countries, out-of-pocket expenditure for healthcare services places a
substantial restriction on access, debilitating viral control efforts [25, 26]. Furthermore, the
region has experienced a wave of political and economic changes during the previous years
and with the arrival of COVID-19, increased pressure is placed on already overstretched
healthcare services. This combination of inequality, lack of governability, and debilitated
services have already resulted in tragic scenarios during the COVID-19 pandemic in some LAC
countries.
Our analysis depicts Panama as the most affected country in the region when a population
correction is applied, not only due to the increase in positive cases (CCC, CICC) but also due
to the number of official deaths reported (CCD, CICD). Panama in comparison with Italy, one
of the most heavily affected countries in the world showed a dramatic increase in the number
of cases, an exponential growth that was reached 18 days earlier than Italy. We speculate that
as Panama has high aerial and maritime international traffic, these factors that might have
played an important role importing asymptomatic cases earlier than its first report [27, 28].
Other countries have case-related data (CCC, CICC, DCMI) increasing at a faster rate than
Italy. Chile, for instance, one of the richest countries in the region had a marked increase in the
number of confirmed cases during the third week of the local out-brake. This situation could
be explained due to the Chilean effective testing strategies [29, 30]. For instance, Chile
performed 88 molecular test per million people every day with one of the lowest positive test
ratios in the region (9.18%). Chile is also one of the countries with the lowest COVID-19
related deaths in the region (CCID, CCD and CFR) [31]. Uruguay had initially increased in a
similar trend like Panama or Ecuador, nevertheless, as the days passed and more test arrived,
this country showed cumulative rates similar to those seen in Chile [32].
Another fact about other LAC countries compared with Chile is that not enough tests are being
performed, thus a sub-registration of COVID-19 is evident. Countries such as the Dominican

Republic, Bolivia and Ecuador have limited testing capabilities [33], a fact that is supported by
the low number of TMI, DTMI and the high PTR% in relationship with the number of tests
performed.
Estimation of the real number of cases of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) infections is
critical for understanding the frequency of presentation of COVID-19 and the overall pandemic
potential of this infection [34]. A recent report from China suggested that at least 86% of all
infections were not identified, while the transmission rate of undocumented cases was
estimated to be at least 55% of the total of reported infections [34].
In the region, Ecuador has been highlighted due to its COVID-19 pandemic management and
the rapid geographic spread of the novel coronavirus [35]. This equatorial country received
worldwide attention due to the excessive number of undocumented deaths upon the arrival of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the region [35]. According to the official figures published by
the National Emergency Management Committee Ecuador reported in April 16th, at least
10,939 deaths were officially recorded during the first 45 days of the arrival of the virus in
Ecuador (March to April 15th), a number 202% higher than the 3,622 deaths recorded during
the first two months of 2020 [35]. These number is largely dependent on the number of cases
reported in the province of Guayas, the province with the highest impact of the arrival of
COVID-19 in the country. Although the government has not officially stated that the excessive
numbers of deaths are due to COVID-19, a significant number of these deaths are likely
COVID-19 related, especially when other violent causes of deaths (traffic accidents and
homicides) have been reduced due to the partial cuff implemented in the country during the
first week of March [36–38].
Brazil, the most populated country in the region, had the highest number of cases reported in
the region, nevertheless, when the population-size was corrected a reduction in CICC, CICD,
TMI, DTMI and DCMI values were observed. Brazil has been struggling with a lack of strong
political leadership to minimize the effects of COVID-19 within the communities which
undoubtedly has contributed to the high daily confirmed cases per million inhabitants.
Concerning the positive test rate percentage within the region, the 10% threshold suggested by
the World Health Organization is an indicator that helps us determine the diagnosis efforts
performed for each country seems to be too high to accomplish for several countries. For
instance, Dominican Republic reported the highest positive rate in April the 8th with at least

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.25.20079863; this version posted April 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

46.4% of the total number of tests being positive, followed by Bolivia (35.5%), Ecuador
(30.9%) and Brazil (29.5%). When we compare these figures with other countries, we can
observe that Ecuador, one of the most affected in the region has almost 120% more positive
cases per every test performed than Italy, 1,500% more than South Korea and almost 7,000%
more than Vietnam[30].
It is important to empathize that the figures reported rely on national government statistics,
nevertheless, is critical to understand that testing capabilities are widely reduced in some
countries in the region.

Without adequate mechanisms of efficiently testing as much

population as possible, contact tracing strategies, and effective isolation of suspected cases
becomes a real challenge[29].
The analysis of these trends is an interim insight into the current situation in the region. The
best action that countries can take is implementing social distancing measures and reducing
travel, so individuals are less likely to come into contact with each other, therefore reducing
the rate of transmission and alleviating pressure on health systems.
Limitations
During the performance of this study, a disparity of the reports obtained from the different
freely accessible published databases was evidenced regarding the reporting dates of the first
case, confirmed cases and registered deaths values. For this reason, to maintain uniformity of
the data, Johns Hopkins University database was used for graphs and tables.
Regarding the rates used, it’s evident that CFR% and PTR% are highly variable during the
pandemic, therefore they don't reflect correctly the impact of deaths and tests carried out in a
country. Furthermore, the recovered case data was not used because, until the end of the study,
any country reported more than a thousand cases, and it is suggested that these variables and
the adjusting for outcome delay in CFR estimates should be analysed in subsequent studies.
It is important to understand that there is lack of reliable diagnostic tests (RT-PCR) data in the
region. On top of that, some countries do not report the results of private providers, thus the
analysis is often performed with the available data.
Another critical limitation is the lack of information for most of the countries when
distinguishing between tests that were collected versus those which were processed.

Understanding the role of good testing strategies is important for the correct understanding of
the health crisis at the individual and collective level. The lack of installed capabilities in some
countries can produce a false sensation of fewer cases, while there are more cases out there,
cases that cannot be identified [34].
This study only used confirmed cases of COVID-19, and undoubtedly there will be a large
proportion of individuals who have died without testing conducted or are in remote
communities which may go unreported.
Conclusions
The experience and trends from Italy showed that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing
rapidly in LAC Countries. Thus, hospitals should prepare themselves for an increase in the
number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care units
where patients may require ventilation. Most LAC counties have implemented different public
health measures to decrease the pressure on healthcare since the third week of March to
mitigate the impact of the pandemic, such as travel restriction and social distancing. Finally,
there is a wide variety of scenarios established between LAC countries, however, in this study,
there was a lack of testing for a number of countries. This is an issue which needs addressing,
and requires strong political will and resource to be able to provide the best care for patients
and their families.
