Abstract
Objectives

We aimed to derive and validate a triage tool, based on clinical assessment alone, for predicting
adverse outcome in acutely ill adults with suspected COVID-19 infection.

Methods

We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 emergency
departments across the United Kingdom (UK). We collected presenting data from 22445 people
attending with suspected COVID-19 between 26 March 2020 and 28 May 2020. The primary
outcome was death or organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) by record review at 30
days. We split the cohort into derivation and validation sets, developed a clinical score based on the
coefficients from multivariable analysis using the derivation set, and the estimated discriminant
performance using the validation set.

Results

We analysed 11773 derivation and 9118 validation cases. Multivariable analysis identified that age,
sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, performance
status, consciousness, history of renal impairment, and respiratory distress were retained in analyses
restricted to the ten or fewer predictors. We used findings from multivariable analysis and clinical
judgement to develop a score based on the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status. This had
a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) in the validation cohort and predicted
adverse outcome with sensitivity 0.98 (0.97-0.98) and specificity 0.34 (0.34-0.35) for scores above
four points.

Conclusion

A clinical score based on NEWS2, age, sex, and performance status predicts adverse outcome with
good discrimination in adults with suspected COVID-19 and can be used to support decision-making
in emergency care.

Introduction
The initial management of acutely ill people with suspected COVID-19 involves assessing the risk of
adverse outcome and the need for life-saving intervention, to then determine decisions around
hospital admission and inpatient referral.[1-5] Triage tools can assist decision-making by combining
information from clinical assessment in a structured manner to predict the risk of adverse outcome.
They can take the form of a score that increases with the predicted risk of adverse outcome or a rule
that categorises patients into groups according to their risk or their intended management. Inclusion
of laboratory and radiological information can improve prediction but requires hospital attendance,
increases emergency department (ED) length of stay, and increases the infection risk related to
repeated patient contacts. An appropriate triage tool for suspected COVID-19 needs to be based on
clinical assessment alone and applicable to people with suspected COVID-19.
We designed the Pandemic Influenza Triage in the Emergency Department (PAINTED) study
following the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic to develop and evaluate triage tools in any future
influenza pandemic.[6] We changed PAINTED to the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency
System Triage (PRIEST) study in January 2020 to address any pandemic respiratory infection,
including COVID-19. The United Kingdom (UK) Department of Health and Social Care activated
PRIEST on 20 March 2020 to develop and evaluate triage tools in the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial
descriptive analysis of the PRIEST data showed that adults presenting to the ED with suspected
COVID-19 have much higher rates of COVID-19 positivity, hospital admission and adverse outcome
than children.[7] We therefore decided to undertake separate studies in adults and children, and
only develop a new triage tools in adults, which we present here.
Evaluation of existing triage tools using the PRIEST study data suggested that CURB-65, [8] the
National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2) [9] and the Pandemic Modified Early Warning Score
(PMEWS) [10] provide reasonable prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19 (cstatistics 0.75 to 0.77). [11] Scope therefore existed to develop a specific triage tool for COVID-19
with better prediction for adverse outcome.

Aims and objectives
We aimed to derive and validate a triage tool in the form of an illness severity score, based on
clinical assessment alone, for predicting adverse outcome in acutely ill adults with suspected COVID19 infection.

Methods
Design
We designed PRIEST as an observational study to collect standardised predictor variables recorded in
the ED, which we would then use to derive and validate new tools for predicting adverse outcome
up to 30 days after initial hospital presentation. The study did not involve any change to patient care.
Hospital admission and discharge decisions were made according to usual practice, informed by local
and national guidance.
Setting and population
We identified consecutive patients presenting to the ED of participating hospitals with suspected
COVID-19 infection. Patients were eligible if they met the clinical diagnostic criteria [12] of fever (≥
37.8°C) and acute onset of persistent cough (with or without sputum), hoarseness, nasal discharge
or congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, wheezing, or sneezing. This was determined on the
basis of the assessing clinician recording that the patient had suspected COVID-19 or completing a
standardised assessment form designed for suspected pandemic respiratory infection [6].
Interventions
For this study we planned to develop a triage tool in the form of an illness severity score based on
clinical assessment and routine observations that any health care professional could use to rapidly
estimate the risk of adverse outcome. The score would be based on a number of categorised
variables, with points allocated to each category of each variable, which would then be summed to
give a total score reflecting the predicted risk of adverse outcome. To enhance usability, we planned
to (a) use a restricted number of variables, rather than all potentially predictive variables, and (b)
categorise variables in accordance with currently used scores, unless there was clear evidence that
these categories provided suboptimal prediction.
Data collection
Data collection was both prospective and retrospective. Participating EDs were provided with a
standardised data collection form (Appendix 1) that included variables used in existing triage tools or
considered to be potentially useful predictors of adverse outcome. Participating sites could adapt
the form to their local circumstances, including integrating it into electronic or paper clinical records
to facilitate prospective data collection, or using it as a template for research staff to retrospectively
extract data from clinical records. We did not seek consent to collect data but information about the

study was provided in the ED and patients could withdraw their data at their request. Patients with
multiple presentations to hospital were only included once, using data from the first presentation
identified by research staff.
Outcome measurement
Research staff at participating hospitals reviewed patient records at 30 days after initial attendance
and recorded outcomes using the follow-up form in Appendix 2. The primary outcome was death or
major organ support (respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal) up to 30 days after initial attendance.
Death and major organ support were also analysed separately as secondary outcomes. Our primary
outcome definition reflected the need for triage tools to identify patients at risk of adverse outcome
or requiring life-saving intervention to prevent adverse outcome. Respiratory support was defined as
any intervention to protect the patient’s airway or assist their ventilation, including non-invasive
ventilation or acute administration of continuous positive airway pressure. It did not include
supplemental oxygen alone or nebulised bronchodilators. Cardiovascular support was defined as any
intervention to maintain organ perfusion, such as inotropic drugs, or invasively monitor
cardiovascular status, such as central venous pressure or pulmonary artery pressure monitoring, or
arterial blood pressure monitoring. It did not include peripheral intravenous cannulation or fluid
administration. Renal support was defined as any intervention to assist renal function, such as
haemofiltration, haemodialysis, or peritoneal dialysis. It did not include intravenous fluid
administration.
Analysis
We randomly split the study population into derivation and validation cohorts by randomly
allocating the participating sites to one or other cohort. We developed a score based on the
prognostic value of predictor variables in multivariable analysis of the derivation cohort and expert
judgements regarding clinical usability. Candidate predictors were combined in a multivariable
regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) using ten sample cross
validation to select the model. The LASSO begins with a full model of candidate predictors and
simultaneously performs predictor selection and penalisation during model development to avoid
overfitting. The LASSO was performed twice: once where the number of predictors were
unrestricted, and a second time when the LASSO was restricted to pick ten predictors. Fractional
polynomials were used to model non-linear relationships for continuous variables.

We excluded cases from all analyses if age or outcome data were missing. We undertook three
multivariable analyses, using different approaches to missing predictor variable data in the
derivation cohort: (1) Complete case; (2) Multiple imputation using chained equations; (3)
Deterministic imputation with missing predictor data assumed to be normal, where applicable. We
did not consider any predictor with more than 50% missing data across the cohort for inclusion in
the predictive model.
Clinical members of the research team reviewed the models and selected variables for inclusion in
the triage tool, based on their prognostic value in the model, the clinical credibility of their
association with adverse outcome, and their availability in routine clinical care. We categorised
continuous variables, using recognised categories from existing scores where appropriate, while
checking that categorisation reflected the relationship between the variable and adverse outcome in
the derivation data. We then assigned integer values to each category of predictor variable, taking
into account the points allocated to the category in existing scores, and the coefficient derived from
a multivariable logistic regression model using categorised continuous predictors. This generated a
composite clinical score in which risk of adverse outcome increased with the total score.
We applied the clinical score to the validation cohort, calculating diagnostic parameters at each
threshold of the score, constructing a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the
area under the ROC curve (c-statistic) and calculating the proportion with an adverse outcome at
each level of the score. We used deterministic imputation to handle missing data in the validation
cohort, assuming missing predictor variable data were normal, but excluding cases with more than a
pre-specified number of predictor variables missing. We also undertook a complete case sensitivity
analysis.
The sample size was dependent on the size and severity of the pandemic, but based on a previous
study in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic we estimated we would need to collect data from
20,000 patients across 40-50 hospitals to identify 200 with an adverse outcome, giving sufficient
power for model derivation. In the event, the adverse outcome rate in adults was much higher in the
COVID-19 pandemic, giving us adequate power to undertake derivation and validation of triage tools
to predict all three outcomes.

The Sheffield Emergency Care Forum (SECF) is a public representative group interested in emergency
care research. [13] Members of SECF advised on the development of the PRIEST study and two
members joined the Study Steering Committee. Patients were not involved in the recruitment to and
conduct of the study. We are unable to disseminate the findings to study participants directly.
Ethical approval
The North West - Haydock Research Ethics Committee gave a favourable opinion on the PAINTED
study on 25 June 2012 (reference 12/NW/0303) and on the updated PRIEST study on 23rd March
2020. The Confidentiality Advisory Group of the Health Research Authority granted approval to
collect data without patient consent in line with Section 251 of the National Health Service Act 2006.

Results
The PRIEST study recruited 22485 patients from 70 EDs across 53 sites between 26 March 2020 and
28 May 2020. We included 20889 in the analysis after excluding 39 who requested withdrawal of
their data, 1530 children, 20 with missing outcome data, and seven with missing age. The derivation
cohort included 11773 patients and the validation cohort 9118. Table 1 shows the characteristics of
the derivation and validation cohorts.

Supplementary Tables 1 to 3 show the results of multivariable analysis using complete case analysis,
multiple imputation and deterministic imputation. Unrestricted LASSO on multiply imputed data
included more predictors, with a higher c-statistic for the model (0.85, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.86), than the
LASSO on deterministically imputed data or complete cases (c-statistics both 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 to
0.84). When restricted, there were nine predictors that were retained by LASSO in all three analyses
(age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic BP, oxygen saturation/inspired oxygen ratio, history of renal
impairment, performance status, consciousness and respiratory distress). C-statistics for the
restricted models using deterministic imputation and complete case analysis (0.82, 95% CI 0.81 to
0.83) were slightly lower than c-statistics for the respective unrestricted models.
We developed a score through the following steps:
1. Clinical review judged that the nine predictors are clinically credible; that age, sex,
respiratory rate, systolic BP, consciousness, oxygen saturation and inspired oxygen are
routinely recorded in administrative systems and early warning scores (although the ratio of
oxygen saturation to inspired oxygen is not routinely recorded); and that many EDs routinely
record a measure of performance status for suspected COVID-19 cases that could be
mapped onto our scale.
2. We decided to include temperature and heart rate, as these are routinely recorded
alongside other physiological variables in early warning scores, and added prognostic value
in the full models.

3. We created categories for age based on the observed multivariate association between age
and outcome in our data, and categories for respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation,
inspired oxygen, systolic BP, consciousness and temperature based on those used in the
NEWS2 early warning score.
4. We created a multivariable logistic regression model using categorised predictor variables
(Supplementary Table 4) and compared the coefficients for each category of predictor
variable in the NEWS2 score to the points allocated in the NEWS2 score. We judged that the
inconsistencies between the coefficients and the points used in NEWS2 were insufficient to
justify allocating alternative points in our score. We allocated points to categories of age, sex,
performance status, renal history, and respiratory distress, based on the coefficients in the
model.
5. We removed renal history and respiratory distress from the multivariable model
(Supplementary Table 5), noted that this made no meaningful difference to the c-statistic
(0.82 in both models) and, given concerns about subjectivity and lack of routine recording,
decided not to include them in the score.
The developed score is shown in Figure 1. We applied the score to the validation cohort. Figure 2
shows the ROC curve, with a c-statistic of 0.80 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.81) for the score. Sensitivity analysis
using only complete cases gave a c-statistic of 0.79 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.80). Supplementary Figures 1
and 2 show the calibration plots for the unrestricted and restricted LASSO models applied to the
validation cohort. The c-statistics (0.82 and 0.81 respectively, compared with 0.80 for the score)
indicate the effect of restricting the number of variables and then developing a score had upon
discrimination. Figure 3 shows the probability of adverse outcome for each value of the score. Table
3 shows the sensitivity and specificity for predicting outcome at each threshold of the triage tool.

Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 show the ROC curves, and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 show the
predictive performance of the score when applied to the secondary outcomes of organ support and
death without organ support in the validation cohort. The score provided better prognostic
discrimination for death without organ support (c-statistic 0.83, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.84) than for organ
support (0.68, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.69).

Discussion
We have developed a clinical illness severity score for acutely ill patients with suspected COVID-19
that combines the NEWS2 score, age, sex, and performance status to predict the risk of death or
receipt of organ support. The score ranges from zero to 29 points, with a score greater than four
predicting adverse outcome with high sensitivity. In developing the score, we tried to optimise
usability without compromising performance. Usability was optimised by basing the score on the
existing NEWS2 score and only adding easily available information. The c-statistic of the score on the
validation cohort was 0.80, compared with 0.82 and 0.81 when the unrestricted and restricted
models were applied to the validation cohort, suggesting that simplifying the tool did not excessively
compromise prediction.

We previously analysed the performance of triage tools that have been recommended in guidelines
for the initial assessment of acutely ill people with sepsis, and showed that CURB-65 (c-statistic 0.75),
PMEWS (0.77) and NEWS2 (0.77) offer good prediction for adverse outcome. Our new triage tool
offers improved prediction with the addition of three variables.
Previous research
A living systematic review [14] has identified 50 prognostic models for adverse outcome in people
with diagnosed COVID-19. C-statistics ranged from 0.68 to 0.99, and the most frequently used
predictor variables were age, sex, comorbidities, temperature, lymphocyte count, C reactive protein,
creatinine, and imaging features. Recently the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol
developed and validated the 4C Mortality Score [15] that predicts the mortality risk for people
admitted with COVID-19 with better discriminant performance than 15 pre-existing risk stratification
scores (c-statistic 0.77 versus 0.61-0.76).
Mortality prediction scores have an important role predicting mortality in hospital admissions but
have limitations as triage tools. The inclusion of laboratory data as predictor variables usually
requires hospital attendance, prolongs ED stay and prevents the rapid assessment required in ED or
prehospital settings. Furthermore triage tools need to predict need for life-saving intervention
rather than just mortality, and ideally need to be developed and evaluated in a relevant cohort, i.e.
those with suspected COVID-19, including those not admitted to hospital after assessment.
Rapid clinical scores have been proposed or evaluated in several studies. Liao et al [16] proposed
adding age>65 years to the NEWS2 score to aid decision-making, based on early experience of the
pandemic in China. Myrstad et al [17] reported a c-statistic of 0.822 (95% CI 0.690 to 0.953) for
NEWS2 predicting death or severe disease in a small study (N=66) of people hospitalised with
confirmed COVID-19. Hu et al [18] reported c-statistics of 0.833 (0.737 to 0.928) for the Rapid
Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and 0.677 (0.541 to 0.813) for the Modified Emergency Medicine
Score (MEWS) for predicting mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Haimovich et al [19]
developed the quick COVID-19 severity index, consisting of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and
oxygen flow rate, which predicted respiratory failure within 24 hours in adults admitted with COVID19 requiring supplemental oxygen with a c-statistic of 0.81 (0.73 to 0.89).

We collected data from a clinically relevant population of patients presenting with suspected COVID19 across a varied range of EDs. The large sample size and high rate of adverse outcome provided
good statistical power to support analysis of many predictor variables in multivariable analysis and
allowed us to estimate parameters with a high degree of precision. An important limitation is that
retrospective data collection resulted in some missing and may have resulted in some inaccuracy of
predictor variable recording. Recording of inspired oxygen concentration was subject to a
particularly high rate of missing data. We anticipated this problem and pre-specified analyses
involving multiple imputation, deterministic imputation, and complete case analysis to explore the
impact of missing data. There was reasonable concordance between the models. Another potential
limitation is that we may have missed adverse outcomes if patients attended a different hospital
after initial hospital discharge. This is arguably less likely in the context of a pandemic, in which
movements between regions were curtailed, but cannot be discounted. The 5-point scale we used
for determining performance status has not been widely used or evaluated, although the 9-point
clinical frailty index maps onto it reasonably well. Finally, although our triage tool can be used in the
prehospital or community setting, we recommend caution in extrapolating our findings to settings
where there is likely to be a lower prevalence of adverse outcome.
Implications for practice
Our clinical score could be used to support ED decision-making around hospital admission and
inpatient referral. A score greater than four could provide an appropriate balance of sensitivity and
specificity to support hospital admission decisions, while a higher threshold could be used to select
patients for critical care referral. However, triage tools should support and not replace clinical
decision-making, and patient preferences and values must be considered. Our triage tool could also
be used to support prehospital and community decision-making around decisions to refer for
hospital assessment. However, further validation is required to determine the performance of the
tool in these settings.
In summary, we have developed a clinical score that can provide a rapid and accurate assessment of
the risk of adverse outcome in adults who are acutely ill with suspected COVID-19.
