Abstract
Background: Recruitment into randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for
prevention of COVID-19 has been adversely affected by a widespread conviction that HCQ
is not effective for prevention. In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted
a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID19.
Methods: A search of PubMed and medRxiv with expert consultation found five completed
randomized trials: two pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and three post-exposure prophylaxis
trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to
HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk
ratio estimates.
Results: The estimated risk ratios were 0.74 (95% CI 0.50-1.10), 0.95 (0.25, 3.64) for the
pre-exposure prophylaxis trials, and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58-1.18), 0.68 (95% CI: 0.34-1.34) and
1.10 (95% CI 0.76-1.61) for the post-exposure prophylaxis trials. The pooled risk ratio
estimate was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70-1.06) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random
effects approach, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.65-1.15) when using a conservative modification of
the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. All five trials found a similar rate of serious
adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups.
Discussion: A benefit of HCQ cannot be ruled out based on the 5 completed trials, but the
“not statistically significant” findings from two early trials were widely interpreted as definite
evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ for prophylaxis of COVID-19. This interpretation
disrupted the timely completion of the remaining trials and thus the generation of precise
estimates for pandemic management before the development of vaccines.

Background
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is not an effective treatment for established coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) (1, 2), but it is unclear whether HCQ can prevent symptomatic COVID19. Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, about 30 randomized trials were designed to study
the prophylactic effect of HCQ (3). After the findings from two of these trials were reported
in the Summer of 2020 (4, 5), HCQ was generally viewed by the medical community as
ineffective for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The emergence of that consensus was surprising
because both trials found a lower risk of COVID-19 in the HCQ group, were too small to rule
out either benefit or harm of HCQ, and had significant methodological limitations.
A timely completion of the remaining trials would have generated precise estimates of the
potential effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19 among those at high risk of infection or
complications. However, the widespread conviction about HCQ’s lack of effectiveness
dramatically slowed down the recruitment into ongoing trials of HCQ prophylaxis (some of
them carried out by the authors of this report) (6). As a result, key decisions were made based
on insufficient evidence during the pre-vaccine period of the pandemic.
In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized
trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19 either before known
exposure to an infected individual (pre-exposure prophylaxis) or after known exposure to an
infected individual (post-exposure prophylaxis).

Methods
Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were randomized clinical trials comparing
hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis (pre-exposure or post-exposure) for COVID-19 with a

non-active control, included individuals who were PCR-negative at the time of treatment
assignment, had been completed, and had the full text published in a peer-reviewed journal or
as a pre-print. Given the relatively small number of trials conducted so far, we identified
candidate studies through expert consultation and confirmed the findings with a search of
PubMed and medRxiv as of January 2, 2021, using the search strategy in the Appendix. Two
authors (XGA and MAH) independently reviewed the full text of the identified studies and
extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved by consulting other co-authors (JdA, RP).
Incomplete or unpublished data were requested from the investigators of each trial. The risk
of bias of the included studies was assessed independently by 2 authors (XGA, MAH) using
the “Rob 2” tool by the Cochrane Bias Methods Group (7).
For each of the identified trials, we obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 for
assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) among PCR-negative
individuals at baseline. Our primary analysis is based on the definition of COVID-19 reported
in the primary analysis of each study. Also, we tried to harmonize the definition of COVID19 across studies by conducting separate meta-analyses among those studies that reported
“laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis” and among those that reported “laboratoryconfirmed or clinically-probable COVID-19 diagnosis”.
We calculated the pooled risk ratio estimate and its 95% confidence or compatibility interval
(CI) using a fixed (or common) effect approach and two types of random effects approaches
(8, 9). The standard random effects method has been shown to yield an anticonservative (that
is, too narrow) 95% CI (8). The alternative Hartung-Knapp random effects method (9) has
been shown to generally outperform the standard random effects method (10), but it results in
an even more anticonservative 95% CI (narrower than the 95% CI from the standard method)
when, as in our meta-analysis, the estimated between-study heterogeneity is small (tau-

squared near zero) (11, 12). We therefore used the Hartung-Knapp method with an ad hoc
modification (13) designed to ensure that its 95% CI remains wider than that of the standard
method, even though the resulting 95% CI is expected to be conservative (too wide) when, as
in our meta-analysis, the number of studies is small (14). All analyses were conducted in
Stata (version 16.1; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).

Results
Five completed randomized trials were identified (4, 5, 15-17). Two trials studied
hydroxychloroquine as pre-exposure prophylaxis (15, 16) and three as post-exposure
prophylaxis (4, 5, 17). Our risk of bias assessment identified the handling of incomplete
ascertainment of the outcome and the exclusion of patients after randomization as possible
sources of moderate bias (see Supplementary Material).
The two pre-exposure prophylaxis trials were double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials that
included healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to patients with COVID-19. In the first
one (16), the risk of COVID-19 was 5.9% (58 total cases, 11 confirmed by PCR) among 989
participants assigned to HCQ (two 400 mg doses on day 1, followed by 400 mg either once or
twice weekly for 12 weeks) and 7.9% (39 total cases, 6 confirmed by PCR) among 494
participants assigned to placebo. The estimated risk difference was -2.0% (95% CI -4.8, 0.8)
and the risk ratio was 0.74 (95% CI 0.50, 1.10). In the second trial (15), the risk of COVID19 was 6.3% (4 cases confirmed by PCR) among 64 participants assigned to HCQ (600 mg
daily for 8 weeks) and 6.6% (4 cases confirmed by PCR) among 61 participants assigned to
placebo. The estimated risk difference was -0.3% (95% CI -8.9, 8.3) and the risk ratio 0.95
(95% CI 0.25, 3.64).

The three post-exposure prophylaxis trials included asymptomatic contacts of confirmed
COVID-19 cases. The first one was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which the risk
of COVID-19 diagnosis (largely based on compatible symptoms) was 11.8% in 414 contacts
assigned to HCQ (800 mg. on day 1, 600 mg. daily for four days) and 14.3% in 407 contacts
assigned to placebo. The risk difference was -2.4% (95% CI: -7.0, 2.2) and the risk ratio can
be calculated as 0.83 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.18). The second one (5) was an open-label, clusterrandomized trial in which the COVID-19 risk (based on confirmed PCR) was 3.0% in 958
contacts assigned to HCQ (800 mg. on day 1, 400 mg. daily for six days) and 4.3% in 1042
contacts assigned to usual care. The risk ratio (adjusted for age, gender, region, and time of
exposure) was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.34, 1.34); the corresponding risk difference cannot be directly
calculated from the data provided. The third study (17) was a double-blind, placebocontrolled cluster-randomized trial in which the COVID-19 risk (also based on confirmed
PCR) was 15.0% in 353 contacts assigned to HCQ (400 mg/d orally for 3 days, then 200
mg/d orally for 11 days) and 13.4% in 336 contacts assigned to placebo (ascorbic acid 500
mg/d orally for 3 days, then 250 mg/d orally for 11 days). The adjusted risk ratio (provided
by the authors) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.76, 1.61).
The time from exposure to initiation of prophylaxis was relatively long in the three postexposure prophylaxis trials: in one trial, about a third of participants were enrolled 4 days
after exposure (none was enrolled later) (4); in the other, about 10% of participants were
enrolled 7 or more days after exposure (5); in the third study, 8% of participants received a
first dose 5 days or later after exposure (17). For comparison, post-exposure prophylaxis for
HIV is recommended in the first 6-72 hours after the exposure (18, 19).

hydroxychloroquine was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70-1.06) when using either a fixed effect or a
standard random effects approach, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.65-1.15) when using the ad hoc
modification of the Hartung-Knapp approach. All five trials found a similarly low rate of
serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups (4, 5, 15-17). As expected, the
proportion of mild gastrointestinal side effects was greater in the HCQ group.
In an analysis of the outcome “laboratory-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19”, the pooled
risk ratio estimate was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.58-1.44) or 0.91 (95% CI: 0.44-1.92); in an analysis
restricted to the three trials that reported “laboratory-confirmed or clinically-probable
COVID-19” (4, 5, 16), the pooled risk ratio estimate was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.73-1.08) or 0.89
(95% CI: 0.58-1.37) (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). The pooled risk ratio was 0.76 (95%
CI 0.52-1.10) for the two pre-exposure prophylaxis studies (15, 16), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.711.16) for the three post-exposure prophylaxis studies (4, 5, 17) using a fixed effect approach.

Discussion
When considered together, the available randomized trials yield a point estimate of an
approximately 10% lower risk of COVID-19 for assignment to HCQ compared with no HCQ
among PCR-negative individuals at randomization. Any effect between a 30% reduction in
risk and a 10% increase in risk is highly compatible with the data from these trials.
As studies appeared between June and September, the point estimate hovered around a 20%
reduction with increasingly narrower compatibility intervals (Supplementary Figure 3). Yet
throughout this entire period the opinion of many medical researchers was that HCQ was
ineffective for prevention and that additional trials were unnecessary. The point estimate
moved to around 10% reduction after the publication in December of a cluster-randomized

study (17). In this study, the proportion of individuals with negative PCR at baseline differed
between randomized groups and no outcomes were recorded among individuals with
unavailable PCR at baseline. The practical implications of these baseline imbalances are
unclear but may have guided the investigators’ decision to adjust for baseline variables,
which was not contemplated in the study protocol (20).
Like in many meta-analyses, there was some degree of between-study heterogeneity with
respect to the definition of the COVID-19 outcome, the period over which the outcome was
ascertained, and the specifications of the interventions being studied. Despite these sources of
design heterogeneity (which we summarize below), the point estimates from the studies
included in the meta-analysis were similar and the statistical heterogeneity, as measured by
the I2, was close to zero.
When we attempted to harmonize the definition of COVID-19, the point estimates were
closer to the null value than those of our primary analysis, with a similar or greater level of
uncertainty. However, the available information was insufficient to adequately harmonize the
outcomes, and thus our attempt at harmonization may have introduced some degree of
selection bias or misclassification bias. Estimates for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 are
difficult to interpret because the limited access to testing for participants in two of the studies
(4, 16), implies that their estimates are based on a non-random subset of the cases that should
have been laboratory confirmed. Also, some test results were self-reported. Estimates for
“laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed COVID-19” are difficult to interpret because
this definition includes only symptomatic individuals in two of the studies (4, 16), but also
asymptomatic individuals with a positive PCR in another one (5). Ideally, all studies would
have used the same primary outcome as the trial by Mitjà et al. (5): symptomatic COVID-19
with laboratory confirmation.

The occurrence of COVID-19 was ascertained over different periods across the studies: two
weeks in the studies of Boulware et al. (4), Mitja et al. (5) and Barnabas et al. (17), 8 weeks
in the study by Abella et al. (15) and 12 weeks in the study by Rajasingham et al. (16).
However, given the long half-life of HCQ (21), it is unlikely that variations in the order of
weeks would be sufficient to substantially alter the trial estimates.

In addition, we made the a priori decision of pooling studies of pre-exposure and postexposure prophylaxis as the mechanism of action of HCQ is thought to be similar for both
preventive approaches (21). When we stratified the meta-analysis by pre- or post-exposure
prophylaxis trials, the effect estimates were similar but even more imprecise. However, a
discussion about the appropriateness of pooling these two types of studies is warranted. A
long time from exposure to treatment initiation in post-exposure trials weakens the case for
pooling studies of pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis as the latter can resemble
studies of early treatment. As the number of completed randomized trials increases and
stratified analyses can provide meaningful estimates, it will be important that future metaanalyses present separate estimates for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis.

Since our pooled estimates are very imprecise, we would need additional studies to draw
more precise inferences about the prophylactic effect, if any, of HCQ. Unfortunately,
recruitment for those studies is being impeded by incorrect interpretations of the available
randomized trial evidence. The findings from the first reported trials were widely (and
incorrectly) portrayed as definite evidence of the lack of effectiveness of HCQ, simply
because they were not “statistically significant” when taken individually. Thus, the common
confusion between the concepts “no effect” and “no statistical significance” led many to

conclude that HCQ had no prophylactic effect (which may be a true but premature
conclusion) when we can only conclude that the effect estimate is still too imprecise (22, 23).
Our pooled estimates are based on the design and analytic choices made by the investigators
of each trial, sometimes in a context of limited access to testing for SARS-CoV-2. We
encourage the investigators from these and future prophylaxis trials to coordinate analyses of
individual-level data with standardized outcome definitions; corrections for differences in
length of follow-up, treatment dose, and time since exposure; adjustment for losses to followup and other deviations from protocol (24); and adoption of a more causally-interpretable
meta-analytic approach (25). We also encourage the authors of living systematic reviews to
update their findings frequently when, as in this case, public opinion interferes with the
generation of the very evidence that will feed their systematic review.
In summary, throughout most of the pre-vaccine period of the pandemic, the available
evidence was compatible with HCQ being viable as prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of
infection or complications. Yet an incorrect interpretation of early inconclusive studies
interfered with the timely completion of the trials needed to make a final determination. The
recent approval of effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines makes this discussion less relevant for the
current pandemic. It is important, however, to improve the process by which the medical
community develops and interprets data before the next public health emergency arrives. To
avoid he proliferation of small studies with different methodologies, national regulators and
international health organizations can play a key role in the coordination and harmonization
of the randomized trials that they approve or endorse.

Supplementary Figure 1. Risk ratio estimates of “laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19” for hydroxychloroquine vs. no
hydroxychloroquine in randomized trials of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis, pooled and by study.
Note: Estimates for the studies by Boulware et al. and by Rajasingham et al. are based on a nonrandom subset of the cases that should have been
laboratory-confirmed because participants in these studies had limited access to testing. The adjusted risk ratio from Barnabas et al. was not
available but the hazard ratio was 1.24 (95% CI 0.81-1.90).

The proportion of patients excluded for not having a negative PCR at baseline differed by

exposure arm: 13.3% in the HCQ arm and 20.4% in the control group (95% CI of the risk
difference is -12.2% to -2.0%). No cases were detected among those with an inconclusive
PCR at baseline (13.4% were expected if the risk was the same as for those with a negative
PCR at baseline).
2

Thirteen patients were excluded after randomization for reaching the primary endpoint

before starting the study drug.
3

Seven patients were excluded after randomization for presenting a positive test at baseline,

never took the study medication or withdrew from the study.
4

One hundred patients were excluded after randomization for presenting symptoms at the

time of receiving the trial intervention. Over 10% of the remaining patients did not have
complete information on the outcome because they did not complete the follow-up.
5

Over 7% of randomized patients were excluded from the analysis for not having complete

outcome data.
6

Adjustment for age, sex, and quarantine status was not specified in the study protocol (20).
