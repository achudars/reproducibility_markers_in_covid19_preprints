Abstract
Background. The added value of interventions to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
among university affiliates is uncertain but needed as universities attempt to remain open.

Methods. We use a decision-analytic simulation to examine the cost-effectiveness of
common interventions to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We use Columbia University
for reference values but our approach centers around an online model that allows users to
tailor the model and interventions to their local conditions and existing strategies. All
interventions are compared relative to implementing the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) guidelines alone.

Results. At prevalence rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community
surrounding the university of 0.1%, using a symptom-checking mobile application is costsaving relative to CDC guidelines alone and the university can expect to remain open. At a
prevalence of 1%, standardizing masks will be cost-saving. At a prevalence rate of 2%,
thermal imaging cameras cost $965,070 (95% credible interval [CrI] = $198,821, $2.15
million)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-time testing on entry costs $1.08
million (95% CrI = $170,703, $3.33 million)/QALY gained. Weekly testing costs $820,119
(95% CrI = $452,673, $1.68 million)/QALY gained. Upgrades to ventilation systems or
installation of far-ultraviolet C lighting systems will be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay
threshold of $200,000/QALY gained only if aerosols account for 86-90% of all on-campus
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusions. The value of interventions to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 vary greatly
with the prevalence rate of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community
surrounding the university.

Introduction
In September of 2020, roughly half of U.S. universities and colleges allowed at least
some students back for in-person instruction.1-4 Re-opening protocols for universities in
the US are largely based on a core set of principles set by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC),5 including social distancing, facial coverings, an emphasis on
handwashing, and enhanced cleaning procedures.5 The CDC indicates that testing
university affiliates for COVID-19 has not been systematically studied.5 Many additional
screening and preventive measures are available, but the value of implementing them has
not been assessed.1,6
To address such uncertainties, we developed the Columbia Covid-19 Model.7 This is
a user-accessible model that allows different universities to alter input parameters via an
online interface. Universities can use our model to tailor their strategies based upon local
conditions and existing interventions.7

Methods

Overview
The Columbia Covid-19 Model is decision-analytic model that deploys a Monte Carlo
simulation. In this model, a cohort of students and a cohort of staff/faculty cycle daily
through a 91-day semester.7 As each day passes, it calculates the risk of an event (e.g., an
infection, hospitalization, or death) based on the prevalence of actively infectious cases of
COVID-19 in the community where a university is situated.
For the present analysis, we used Columbia University as a case study because we
have extensive information on the socio-demographic characteristics of university
affiliates, novel survey data, and cost data on an array of preventive investments. Our

model adopts a societal perspective that allows for comparisons across cost-effectiveness
analyses using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards
(CHEERS) guidelines.8

Interventions
We compared CDC guidelines (social distancing, protective measures, and
maintaining a healthy environment) to a “do nothing” status quo.9 We then compared the
CDC guidelines with a requirement that all university affiliates self-report COVD-19associated symptoms. We chose to do so a priori because virtually all universities in the US
had, at a minimum, implemented the CDC guidelines, so they represent the “status quo.”1
Our online model also allows for comparisons against no intervention at all.7
We then assessed a policy that universities provide standardized, high quality
masks.13,14 This reduces the number of students using thin, loosely-fitting masks that may
be less effective than snug two-ply masks.13,14 (See Table 1 for assumptions and Table 2 for
input values for this paper.)
Next, we assessed temperature monitoring cameras at facility entry points11,12 to
prevent entry of people with a fever. This strategy is commonly used, and has the effect of
reducing the number of students and employees on campus (thereby increasing social
distancing) even in the absence of COVID-19.
Finally, we assessed one-time entry (“gateway”) testing for SARS-CoV-2 for all
affiliates10 as well as weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Because many universities are experimenting with improving airflow, we also
conducted one-way sensitivity analyses on methods to remove particulate aerosols
(ventilation systems with minimum efficiency reporting value [MERV]-13 filters or far5

ultraviolet C [far-UVC] light).11 In our study, we measure the impact of replacing existing
air handlers entirely and removing re-circulation systems (the process that Columba
University used). At the time of writing, the proportion of COVID-19 cases attributed to
aerosol transmission was unknown, and a one-way sensitivity analysis allows the reader to
assess whether the proportionate reduction is plausible.
All of the interventions vary by adherence to mask use. We therefore present the
results of our analysis at different levels of mask use.

Outcome measures
We examined: 1) the incremental cost of each intervention after accounting for
medical and intangible costs (e.g., in-person versus online classes); 2) the incremental
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained,8,12 where QALYs capture both longevity and
health-related quality of life. A QALY is scaled between zero, representing death, and 1.0,
representing one year of life spent in a perfect health; and 3) the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER, changes in costs divided by the changes in QALYs).

Model specification
Students and staff/faculty were treated as two separate but interacting populations
with different baseline ages, average number of close contacts, exposures, and risks of
illness, hospitalization, and death due to Covid-19.13 We obtained data from Columbia
University on the age of each student, staff, and faculty member. Age-specific risks of
hospitalization and death were obtained from the literature and from the CDC,14,15 and a
weighted risk was calculated separately for students and staff/faculty based upon the age
distribution of each.

We divided the simulation cohort into four mutually exclusive states: susceptible
(those who have not developed the disease and are at risk), infected (those who are
currently infected and contagious), recovered (those who were infected in the past but are
currently recovered), and death. The cycle length of the model is one day, and the time
horizon is over the semester (91 days).
We assessed risk using Mathematica’s 19andMe model.13 This model accounts for
the daily probability of becoming infected among susceptible population based on the
average number of close contacts, the transmission rate per close contact, and the
estimated prevalence of infectious cases inside and outside of the campus. For each
susceptible student and staff/faculty, the probability of becoming infected outside of
campus was calculated as follows:

Similarly, the probability of becoming infected inside the campus was calculated as

Once infected, three consecutive phases of disease progression are possible,
denoted as the time between: 1) the primary exposure and infectiousness; 2)
infectiousness and onset of symptoms (during which they can infect a susceptible
individual but they do not manifest symptoms and therefore do not self-quarantine); and
3) symptom onset until the end of infectiousness. For asymptomatic infected individuals,
the model excludes the second phase. At the end of the third phase, infected individuals are
classified as ‘recovered.’ Infected affiliates are exposed to a chance of illness,
hospitalization, and death.
In addition, infected affiliates incur risk-adjusted costs and lost QALYs associated
with having and treating Covid-19 infection.18 Lost productivity and leisure time were
valued at the average American wage.19 Intangible costs associated with online versus inperson instruction were valued using a survey administered to students who had
experienced learning in each format. Risk tolerance was assessed using a standard gamble
exercise (see Online Appendix).
To evaluate the effects of different interventions, two types of risk reductions were
modeled: 1) the removal of infected affiliates from the university community via

screening/tests; and 2) a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission while on campus (by
applying the adjusted odds ratio of infection associated with different interventions).
We assumed that the campus would close and instruction would switch to onlineonly learning for the remainder of the semester under two conditions: 1) if the model
reached a total of 500 cases of COVID-19 cases among students/staff/faculty (based upon
New York State requirements for closure); or 2) if a super-spreader event (defined as 5 or
more university affiliates from a given campus infected on a single day) occurred. We
single out super-spreader events because they can produce multiple asymptomatic
infections at once, and are usually only uncovered during extended contact investigation (if
at all). As such, they can lead to a spike in infections on campus that overwhelm the
university’s ability to close and clean different areas of the campus.
We modeled the probability of a super-spreader event based upon the prevalence of
infectious cases of disease in the community, , a standard gamble-based risk assessment
administered to students that revealed students’ preferences for participation in
community parties,

Because roughly 10% of exposed cases are, on average, responsible for 80% of

We ran Monte Carlo simulations on all variables simultaneously and 1-way
sensitivity analyses on variables that produced a large influence on the ICER. We assessed
3 scenarios of the prevalence of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in July, 2020: New
York City, “low prevalence” (roughly 0.1%); Texas, “moderate prevalence” (1%); and
Florida, “high prevalence” (2%).17 Results are reported as mean and a 95% “credible
interval” based upon a random sampling of values from multiple distributions (see Table

2). Our model was built on the R statistical platform (The R Foundation, Inc). We deployed
R-Shiny upon R, an interface that allows users to alter model parameters.7

Results

No guidelines in place
At a 0.1% prevalence of actively infectious cases (similar to New York City in July,
2020)21, roughly 350 out of the 20,500 university affiliates we model would contract
COVID-19 infections over the 91-day semester if the university were opened with no CDC
guidelines in place (“status quo”). However, if the prevalence of actively infectious cases
were 1% (Texas in July, 2020) or 2% (Florida in July, 2020), these numbers would rise to
2420 and 4340 infections, respectively.

CDC guidelines in place
At a community prevalence of 0.1%, implementing CDC recommendations would
reduce the number of infections to roughly 230, and the university would remain open the
entire semester at a cost of $2.93 million/QALY gained (95% CrI = $1.23 million/QALY
gained, 11.89 million/QALY gained).

At a community prevalence of 1%, implementing the CDC guidelines would likely be
cost-saving (Table 3), but the “status quo” projections of infections would never be reached
because the university would have to shut down after 36 days (95% CrI = 26, 29 days). At
a prevalence of 2%, implementing CDC guidelines is less favorable than at a 1% prevalence
($65,657/QALY gained; 95% CrI = savings, $2.30 million/QALY gained) because the
university would likely close after 18 days (95% CrI = 13-25 days).

0.1% prevalence. At a 0.1% community prevalence rate of active infectious cases, a
symptom-checking application would be cost-saving and produce 0.02 QALYs gained (95%
CrI = 0.01 QALYs gained-0.04 QALYs gained) relative to implementing the CDC guidelines
alone (Table 3). University-provided 2-ply masks, temperature monitoring cameras,
gateway testing, and weekly testing would each cost >$1 million dollars/QALY gained
relative to CDC recommendations (Table 3). For example, weekly testing would cost $60.70
million (95% CrI = $37.5 million, $104.5 million)/QALY gained.

1% prevalence. At a 1% community prevalence rate of infectious cases, universityprovided masks would likely become cost-saving (95% CrI = cost saving, $1.74
million/QALY gained), but, all other interventions would cost >$1.9 million dollars/QALY
gained.

2% prevalence. At a 2% community prevalence rate of infectious cases, thermal
imaging cameras cost $965,070 (95% CrI = $198,82, $2.15 million)/QALY gained. Gateway
testing would cost $1.08 million (95% CrI = $170,703, $3.33 million)/QALY gained, and
weekly testing would cost $820,119 (95% CrI = $452,673, $1.68 million)/QALY gained.

Sensitivity analyses. At prevalence rates of 0.3% or higher, early university closure
is possible. Therefore, the perceived value of in-person instruction becomes an important
variable. If students are willing to pay 12% of the regular tuition (rather than our baseline

estimate of 48%) for online classes, gateway testing becomes cost-effective at a
willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/QALY gained. At this prevalence rate, universityprovided 2-ply masks and implementing the CDC guidelines become cost-saving.
Weekly testing is sensitive both to the number of close contacts per student on
campus and the transmission rate. However, even as the number of close contacts per
student increases, the value is unlikely to reach the willingness-to-pay threshold of
$200,000/QALY gained at a prevalence of 0.1% (see Online Appendix). When the
prevalence rate reaches 2%, however, weekly testing is a strategy that is cost-saving when
the number of contacts or the transmission rate is higher than those we use in the baseline
scenario (Figure 1).
At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/QALY gained and a prevalence ranges
of 0.3-0.5%, MERV-13 ventilation upgrades would only be cost-effective were fine aerosol
transmission to account for >90% of all campus COVID-19 transmission. For far-UVC
lighting, the threshold for fine aerosol transmission is >86%. As the proportion of students
wearing masks on campus declines, the ICER of both of these systems becomes more
favorable.
Including or excluding faculty and staff over age 70 years had no substantial impact
under any scenario because of their relatively small numbers. Across all prevalence rates,
increasing the chance of a super-spreader event reduced the cost-effectiveness of
interventions because such events lead to early closure of the campus. Additional
sensitivity analyses are available in the Online Appendix.

Our model shows that the value of most of the interventions is dependent on the
prevalence of actively infectious cases of COVID-19 in the community surrounding the
university. When case rates in the surrounding community are low (e.g., as in New York in
July, 2020) the most value will be realized from simply using a symptom checking
application. However, variables such as mask use and the number of contacts between
affiliates are highly influential, and readers are strongly encouraged to change the model
inputs to suit their particular university characteristics using the online version of the
model.7
While a QALY is typically valued at $100,000-$200,000, larger values are placed on
nuclear or aviation regulations—over $1 million/QALY gained—because of the higher
perceived threat amongst the public.22-24 COVID-19 may merit higher investments because
of larger perceived threat of the pandemic.
A recent study by Paltiel and colleagues recommended testing for SARS-CoV-2 when
the prevalence is 0.2%.25 We find that gateway or weekly testing would be costly at this
prevalence rate at Columbia University. These different conclusions can be attributed to
differences in our: 1) infection fatality rate, 2) risk of transmission on campus, 3) the
number of close contacts/student, and 4) outcome measure (we used cost/QALY gained as
an outcome measure while they used cost/case detected). Figure 1 shows as the number of
close contacts between students increases and the rate of transmission increases, so too
does the value of weekly testing. If students return to multi-generational households, we
would expect to find similar results.
Our infection fatality rate (0.02% for students and 0.18% for staff/faculty, Table 1)
is smaller than the average rate for the U.S. (0.5%)14,25 because the population of both the

students and staff/faculty is younger than the general population. Users of our online
model should be careful to define risks specific to their university setting.
Many universities plan to standardize the masks that students wear, such that their
fit and filtration are superior to what students would choose to purchase on their own.26,27
For example, Columbia University will provide two $4 2-ply masks to each student.6 Such
masks would be cost-saving at community prevalence rates of infectious cases above 0.3%
at Columbia University.
Fever is a common symptom in the fall.28 Even though thermal monitoring will
detect few cases of COVID-19, it will send a proportion of university affiliates home,
thereby increasing social distancing and the prevalence of people on campus with a
potentially infectious influenza-like illness. This strategy nevertheless comes at a low value
under most circumstances.
Likewise, installations of high efficiency MERV-13 HVAC systems or far UVC light are
not likely to be worthy of investment unless aerosol transmission accounts for the vast
majority of COVID-19 cases on campus. However, the value of these systems may rise in
areas where students are less likely to wear masks, such as in student housing.
Additionally, while we find that far UVC light comes at a better value than HVAC systems, it
is a new technology and its safety has not been extensively tested in humans.29 It also has
the value of reducing fomite transmission, a factor for which we did not account.
We assumed that super-spreader events would require the university to close
because they may create a “perfect storm” of events in which staff are quarantined even as
multiple areas of the campus must be closed for cleaning and contact tracing. When the
university is closed early, the money spent on any interventions goes to waste, and large
indirect costs associated with online-only instruction are incurred. Therefore, any

intervention to reduce the possibility of students attending mass events, particularly those
that require talking loudly and lowering masks to eat or drink, should be prioritized.
We did not examine approaches that are intuitively cost-effective. For example,
influenza vaccination has been shown to save money and lives.30 Likewise, the “cohort”
model confines groups of students to 20-40 who take all the same courses and live in the
same housing.31 In theory, the cohort model could largely prevent transmission of infection,
thereby vastly reducing the size of each student’s social network.
The major limitation of our analysis is the considerable uncertainty in parameter
estimates. For example, estimates of infection fatality rates can quadruple when hospitals
are overwhelmed with cases.14,17 However, the model is generally robust to different
parameter inputs and assumptions.
Another limitation is that universities vary considerably with respect to sociodemographic composition and risk-taking among students. Additionally, the standard
gamble exercises we used were administered to graduate students of public health, who
may be more risk adverse than average students. We account for differences in student risk
preferences by varying the number of assumed contacts between students, both on and off
campus in sensitivity analyses.
Our findings do not apply to universities in which a large number of students
commute to and from multi-generational households.

Conclusions
Individual universities are likely to find very different value in the interventions we
present. Most universities will find value in strategies to reduce the transmission of COVID19 only if the prevalence of infectious cases in the community is high enough for the

need to close early.

Table 1. Major assumptions used in modeling the cost-effectiveness of strategies to
improve infection control for Covid-19 in the university setting.
1. The campus will be closed and classes will be held online for the remainder of the
semester if: 1) the cumulative number of incident cases among students/staff
reaches 50; or 2) there is a super-spreader event where university students attend a
gathering in which 5 or more students are infected.
2. Super-spreader events will be detected many days after they occur, thereby
producing multiple close contacts.
3. With the onset of symptoms, 85% of students will self-isolate. This percentage will
vary depending on a given university’s ability to monitor students and was tested in
a broad 1-way sensitivity analysis.
4. The average infected student will have an average of 2 close contacts (<6 feet for
more than 10 minutes) on campus and 3 close contacts/day off campus prior to
detection.
5. Viral loads do not differ by sex, age, or severity of disease.
6. All wages are valued at the median hourly wage in the U.S.
7. When an otherwise healthy person is misdiagnosed by a test or thermal screening,
the relevant intangible cost is lost leisure time valued at the national average wage
during the quarantine time.
8. To the extent that aerosol transmission is possible, masks, ventilation systems, and
far ultraviolet-C (UVC) light will be 100% effective at reducing fine aerosol
transmission for those who are not in close contact because both systems clear
>90% of viral particles within 8 minutes.

9. A symptom-checking application to detect a suspected infection will lead to a 10percentage point increase in proportion of individuals who stay home when they
develop symptoms.
10. Students have a similar active infectious case rate as other members of the
community.
11. Fevers detected using thermal cameras will be re-checked using a second method.
12. University-provided masks will not reduce total expenditures on masks (disposable
masks will still be purchased by the university and made available to affiliates).
13. The efficacy of university-provided masks falls at roughly the half-way point
between the “average” mask used by the public and an N95 mask without vents.
14. For air handler exchanges, we accounted for upgrades and construction costs, but
did not account for delays in building openings in our analysis.
15. Students will not commute to or from multi-generational households with older
members or have direct contact with people over the age of 60.
16. We assume that the duration of illness is 14 days, and do not account for the
possibility of long-term symptoms other than known pulmonary or cardiac
involvement.
