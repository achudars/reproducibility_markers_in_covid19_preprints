Abstract
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected

over millions of individuals and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.
It can be difficult to accurately predict mortality among COVID-19 patients
presenting with a spectrum of complications, hindering the prognostication and
management of the disease.
Methods: We applied machine learning techniques to clinical data from a large

cohort of 5,051 COVID-19 patients treated at the Mount Sinai Health System in New
York City, the global COVID-19 epicenter, to predict mortality. Predictors were
designed to classify patients into Deceased or Alive mortality classes and were
evaluated in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve (AUC score).
Findings: Using a development cohort (n=3,841) and a systematic machine learning

framework, we identified a COVID-19 mortality predictor that demonstrated high
accuracy (AUC=0·91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and
prospective (n=249) patients. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical
features: age, minimum O2 saturation during encounter, type of patient encounter
(inpatient vs. various types of outpatient and telehealth encounters),
hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature.

Interpretation: An accurate and parsimonious COVID-19 mortality predictor based

on five features may have utility in clinical settings to guide the management and
prognostication of patients affected by this disease.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected over 3.6 million
individuals, and caused over 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 5th, 2020.(1)
Although the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily targets the respiratory
system(2, 3), complications in other organ systems, e.g., cardiovascular, neurologic
and renal, can also contribute to death from the disease. Clinical experience thus far
has demonstrated significant heterogeneity in the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2
infection, spanning patients who are asymptomatic to those with mild, moderate,
and severe disease forms, with a high percentage of patients who do not survive(2,
3). Notably, it can be difficult to accurately predict clinical outcomes for patients
across this spectrum of clinical presentations. This presents an enormous challenge
to the prognostication and management of COVID-19 patients, especially within
disease epicenters such as New York City (NYC) that need to triage a high volume of
patients. Accurate prediction of COVID-19 mortality, and the identification of
contributing factors would therefore allow for targeted strategies in patients with
the highest risk of death.

Towards this aim, we analyzed clinical data from 5051 patients who had laboratory
confirmed COVID-19 and were treated within multiple hospitals and locations of the
Mount Sinai Health System spanning different boroughs of NYC. We used multiple
machine learning-based classification algorithms(4) to develop models that can
accurately predict mortality from COVID-19. We also identified clinical features that
contributed the most to this prediction. An improved understanding of predictive
factors for COVID-19 is critical to the development of clinical decision support
systems that can better identify those with higher risk of mortality, and inform
interventions to reduce the risk of death.

Methods
Study population

De-identified electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients diagnosed with
COVID-19 within the Mount Sinai Hospital System, New York, NY through April 7,
2020 were included in the study. The Mount Sinai Health System is a network of 5
hospital campuses and over 400 ambulatory practices spanning the New York
metropolitan area (Supplementary Table 1). COVID-19 diagnosis was based on
positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based clinical laboratory testing for the
SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Data from COVID-19 patients through April 6, 2020 were randomly split into two
groups of independent subjects comprising 80% of the sample (n=3841) for
development of the mortality predictor (i.e. development set), and 20% (n=961) to

serve as retrospective test set 1. A prospective validation set of independent
subjects, test set 2, included COVID-19 patients encountered on April 7, 2020
(n=249).

Identification and validation of the predictor

We implemented a systematic machine learning-based framework to construct the
mortality predictor from the development set using missing value imputation(5),
feature selection(6), classification(4) and statistical(7) techniques. The goal of this
predictor was to classify a COVID-19 patient as likely to survive or die from the
disease, i.e., “Alive” or “Deceased,” respectively. The identified predictor was then
validated in test sets 1 and 2 in terms of the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC
score)(8). The overall workflow is shown in Figure 1, and detailed methods are
provided in Supplementary Material.

The demographic and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patients included in
the development set (n=3841), test set 1 (n=961) and test set 2 (n=249) are shown
in Table 1. The majority (55·3%) of patients in the development set were male,
with an even higher prevalence of male sex among the deceased (61·3%). COVID-19
patients were mostly Caucasian (25·3%), African American (26·2%) and Latino
(24·3%), with a minority identifying as Asian (4·2%). Hypertension and diabetes
were the most common comorbidities (22·6% and 15·8%%, respectively). While a
small minority were obese (6·0%) or had cancer (5·4%), an even smaller
percentage had asthma (4·2%), COPD (2·3%), or currently smoked (3·5%). Over a
third of the patients had been treated with azithromycin and/or
hydroxychloroquine, consistent with the health system’s treatment practices during
this time period.
Univariate analyses of patient characteristics in the development set (Table
1) showed that COVID-19 patients who died were significantly older with a mean

age of 73·4 (SD 12·7) vs. 54·7 (SD 18·7) years in survivors (P<0·001). They were
more likely to have had their initial encounter at a hospital rather than at an
outpatient or telehealth setting within our hospital system (P<0·001). Those who
died had higher body temperature and lower oxygen saturation at initial
presentation, and their minimum oxygen (O2) saturation over the duration of their
encounter was also lower (P<0·001 for all). Death from COVID-19 was associated
with smoking (P=0·05), COPD (P<0·001), hypertension (P<0·001), and diabetes
(P<0·001).

The characteristics of test sets 1 and 2 were largely similar to those of the
development set, except for some differences in the relative proportions of race
(Table 1). While minimum O2 saturation during encounter was consistently lower
in the deceased vs. alive patients in both test sets, O2 saturation at presentation was
lower among the deceased in test set 1 only. COPD, hypertension, and diabetes
were more prevalent among the deceased in test set 1, but there were no significant
differences in these comorbidities in test set 2.

Development and validation of the predictor

Following imputation, there were twenty distinct clinical features with less than
20% missing values in the development set that improved predictor performance
(Figure 2A). Compared to the other classification algorithms (LR, RF, SVM),
XGBoost performed significantly better at this and higher levels of missing values
(Figure 2A; Friedman-Nemenyi P<0·001). Therefore, we used the imputed version
of the development set with 20 features and XGBoost, to develop the first COVID-19
mortality predictor in this study, referred to as the 20F model.
We also tested if a smaller subset of the 20 features could yield an even more
accurate predictor, since such a subset would be easier to study and implement in a
clinical setting. Indeed, we found that for the best-performing XGBoost algorithm
(Friedman-Nemenyi P<0·001), the AUC saturated at as few as five features (Figure
2B), validating our hypothesis that fewer than 20 features could yield an accurate

predictor. The five features identified from the development set included the

following: minimum oxygen saturation recorded during the encounter, patient’s age,
type of encounter, maximum body temperature during the encounter, and use of
hydroxychloroquine during treatment. We trained this second Covid-19 mortality
predictor, referred to as the 5F model, by applying XGBoost to these 5 features in
the imputed development set.
Validation of the 20F and 5F models on test set 1 (retrospective data) and test set 2
(prospective data) both yielded very good performance (AUC>0·9; Figure 3). The
predictor’s strong performance in both test sets demonstrated that the predictors
constructed from data on a given day can be reliably applied retrospectively and
prospectively.

Features predictive of mortality

Similar to the features that the 5F model was based on, we identified the five most
predictive features for the other classification algorithms we tested (Figure 4A).
While there was variability among these features due to the inherent differences
among the algorithms, the age of the patient, and their minimum oxygen saturation
level during the clinical encounter (O2SAT_min) were consistent across the
algorithms. The values of O2SAT_min and age were indeed significantly different
between the Deceased and Alive classes (Table 1, Figures 4B and 4C respectively;
T-test P<0.001 for both features), affirming their predictive power. Supplementary
Figure 1 shows that the top five features are consistent across all three runs of the

feature selection and predictor development process.

Discussion

In this study, machine learning algorithms were applied to clinical and demographic
data from 3841 COVID-19 patients from a major New York metropolitan area health
system to identify and test a mortality predictor that demonstrated high accuracy
(AUC=0·91) when applied to test sets of retrospective (n= 961) and prospective
(n=249) patient data. This mortality predictor was based on five clinical features:
age, minimum O2 saturation, type of patient encounter (inpatient vs. outpatient and
telehealth encounters), hydroxychloroquine use, and maximum body temperature.
Given the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course observed among COVID19 patients,(2, 3) factors that contribute most to mortality are not always readily
apparent, rendering care and management of COVID-19 patients difficult in settings
of finite health care resources. Our data-driven findings may help clinicians better
recognize and prioritize the care of patients at greatest risk of death.
A major strength of this study is that it was based on recent data from thousands of
COVID-19 patients encountered within a global disease epicenter (NYC), resulting in
findings that are highly relevant to the current pandemic. The results are based on
rigorous machine learning analyses powered by a robust sample of patients with
laboratory-confirmed COVID and demonstrate the potential of these methods to
identify factors predicting mortality within clinical settings. Application of machine
learning enabled the identification of predictors based on the XGBoost algorithm(9),
where the clinical features contributed to mortality in a non-linear fashion. These

predictors performed with high accuracy (AUC=0·91-0·95) in two independent
validation sets of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the 5F model based on only the
five features listed above performed almost as well as the 20F model based on all
the features. This indicates that accurate mortality predictions can be obtained from
a more parsimonious model, facilitating more efficient implementation in clinical
environments.
Age and minimum oxygen saturation during encounter (O2SAT_min) were the most
predictive features not only for the XGBoost algorithm, but for all four mortality
classifiers tested (Figure 4), emphasizing these features’ epidemiological and
clinical relevance. Since the beginnings of this pandemic, older age has been
recognized as a risk factor(10, 11). In New York State, patients 60 years and over
represent nearly 85% of all deaths due to COVID-19(12), and similarly high rates of
mortality among those of advanced age have been noted in other COVID-19 hotspots
across the United States(13). In addition, the fundamental clinical presentation of
COVID-19 patients across the pandemic has been respiratory symptoms associated
with hypoxia, often leading to subsequent respiratory failure and requiring
ventilator support and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(14). This study’s
finding that a patient’s minimum oxygen saturation (O2SAT_min) value during
hospitalization was the strongest predictive feature of mortality (Figure 4) is in line
with global epidemiologic observations that respiratory failure is the most common
feature of critical illness and death in COVID-10 patients(15, 16).

In addition to age and oxygen saturation, other features in the mortality predictor
are also consistent with clinical observations accumulated from the pandemic
experience to date. For example, the maximum body temperature achieved during
hospitalization (TEMP_max) was a top-ranked feature common to the XGBoost and
random forest-based mortality predictors (Figure 4A). While fever is a common
symptom and sign of COVID-19,(2, 17, 18) patients may not always present with
elevated temperatures, and fever frequently develops later during the course of
hospitalization(2, 19). Consistent with this, these mortality predictors identified
TEMP_max, rather than body temperature at presentation, as a top classifying
feature. Similarly, health care encounter type (inpatient vs. outpatient and
telehealth), was identified as a top-performing XGBoost mortality predictor,
reflecting the fact that COVID-19 patients with more severe symptoms are more
likely to have their initial encounter in the hospital rather than at an outpatient
setting as their first point of contact. Finally, the identification of
hydroxycholoroquine therapy as a top mortality predictor reflects a practice pattern
specific to encounters within our hospital system based on institutional guidelines
provided during a time of limited and evolving knowledge about COVID-19
treatment(20, 21). Specifically, patients in our hospital system with moderate or
severe disease were often placed on hydroxycholoroquine in the absence of overt
contraindications to this therapy.
Several other studies have also investigated factors affecting mortality from COVID19. Some studies conducted statistical association analyses of individual patient

characteristics and risk factors with mortality, albeit on small cohorts (<200
patients)(22-25). Another small cohort study used linear feature selection and
predictor development methods to identify severe COVID-19 cases, achieving an
AUC of 0·853 in a validation cohort(26). Some other studies have started leveraging
clinical data from larger cohorts of several hundred patients to predict mortality
and other COVID-19 outcomes(27). A relative strength of this study is that it
employed a very large patient cohort and systematic combinations of machine
learning methods to yield a more accurate and informative mortality predictor.
Machine learning-based methods are designed to sift through large amounts of
structured and/or unstructured data to discover actionable knowledge without bias
from biomedical hypothesis.(4, 28) In this study, we utilized this power of machine
learning, especially those for feature selection(6) and classification7, to develop
accurate and parsimonious predictors of mortality from COVID-19 from structured
clinical and demographic data. In particular, we found that the XGBoost(9) produced
the best-performing predictors in all our analyses. XGBoost is a sophisticated
prediction algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees by iteratively
focusing on harder to predict subsets of the training data. Due to its systematic
optimization-based design, this algorithm has shown superior performance
predictive modeling applications involving structured data(29, 30), which is
consistent with our observations.

Limitations of the study

Although our datasets likely are the largest that have been used to predict COVID-19
mortality, the clinical features available to us were limited to those routinely
collected during hospital encounters. Although we were able to develop accurate
predictors from these limited data using our machine learning framework, it should
be possible to develop even better predictors using a richer set of features. A key
limitation of clinical indices included in the datasets include the uniformity of
Electronic Medical Record (EMR)-derived data. For example, while minimum
oxygen saturation during the health encounter was identified as a significant
predictor for mortality, limitations inherent in the interpretation of this data must
be noted, such as the unavailability of the amount of supplemental oxygen being
administered at the time of recording and acquisition-related limitations, such as
readings below the threshold of accuracy of the monitoring device (e.g. less than
70%). Nonetheless, we found a clearly lower distribution of minimum oxygen
saturations in those patients who died from COVID-19 compared to those who
survived, highlighting this clinical feature as central to predicting morality for
infected patients.

Conclusion

Applying machine learning approaches to data from a large cohort of COVID-19
patients resulted in the identification of accurate and parsimonious predictors of
mortality. These data-driven findings may help clinicians better recognize and
prioritize the care of patients at greatest risk of death.

Figure legends
Figure 1: Workflow for data management and COVID-19 mortality predictor
development. Data were obtained from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse (MSDW).

After pre-processing, COVID-19-positive patients' data (n=4802) were randomly
divided in an 80:20 ratio into a predictor development (n=3841) and an
independent retrospective validation dataset (test set 1; n=961). For predictor
training and selection, the development set was further randomly split into a 60%
training dataset (n=2880) and a 20% holdout dataset (n=961). Four classification
algorithms (logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine
(SVM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) were evaluated. The final
predictive model was validated on test set 1 and another independent prospective
validation set (test set 2; n=249). The complete details of the computational
methods used can be found in Supplementary Material.

Figure 2: Results from missing value imputation and feature selection during
predictor training and selection. (A) We attempted to find the optimal level of

missing values in the range of 0% to 60% that could be imputed and lead to more
accurate predictors. For this, we took incremental steps of 5% in missing value
levels, and used mean and mode imputation for continuous and categorical features
respectively. At each level, four candidate classifiers (LR, RF, SVM and XGBoost) were
trained and evaluated on the corresponding holdout set in terms of the area under
the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC score) as the metric. This
process was repeated 100 times and the average AUCs for each candidate classifier

and missing value level are shown here, along with error bars denoted by vertical
arrows. (B) Using a setup analogous to (A), and the Recursive Feature Elimination
(RFE) algorithm, we evaluated the performance of the four classification algorithms
with different number of features selected from the full set of twenty. The average
AUC scores from 100 runs of this process are shown here, along with error bars
denoted by vertical arrows. The details of the computational methods underlying
these analyses are provided in Supplementary Material. LR = logistic regression;
RF = random forest; SVM = support vector machine.

Figure 3: Performance of the final mortality predictors on two validation sets.

Based on the results in Figure 2, we constructed two predictors: (1) Training
XGBoost, the best performer in Figure 2(A), on 20 features with at most 20%
missing values (20F model), and (2) Training XGBoost, the best performer in Figure
2(B), on the optimal 5 features at which the performance saturated (5F model). Both
these predictors were evaluated on the (A) retrospective Test set 1 (n=961) and the
(B) prospective Test set 2 (n=249). Evaluation results are shown here in terms of
the ROC curves obtained, as well as their area under the curve (AUC) scores. The
95% confidence intervals of the AUC scores are shown in square brackets.

tested. (A) Top five predictive features identified using the RFE algorithm for the

four classification algorithms across three independent sets of hundred runs each of
the predictor training and selection process described in Figures 1 and 2, and

Supplementary Material. The values in parentheses indicate the number of times

the feature was selected as top ranked. Also shown are violin plots representing the
distributions of the values of the (B) O2SAT_min and (C) age features that were
selected as top predictive features for all the four algorithms. The plot in (B) shows
that the median value of O2SAT_min for the deceased group (79) was significantly
lower (T-test  0.001) than that for the live group (92). Similarly, the plot in (C)
shows that the median age in the deceased group (75) is significantly higher (T-test
 0.001) than that in the alive group (56).
