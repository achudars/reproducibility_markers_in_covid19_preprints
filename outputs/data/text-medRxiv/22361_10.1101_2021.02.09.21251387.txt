Abstract
Background: There is limited evidence about emotional and behavioral responses in toddlers and
preschoolers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, particularly in Latin America.
Objective: To assess associations between changes in movement behaviors (physical activity,
screen time and sleeping) and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers during early stages of
the pandemic in Chile.
Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. Main caregivers
of 1- to 5-year-old children living in Chile answered an online survey that included questions about
sociodemographic characteristics, changes in the child’s emotions and behaviors, movement
behaviors and caregivers’ stress during the pandemic. Multiple linear regressions were used to
assess the association between different factors and emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers.
Results: In total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data on emotional changes for children aged
2.9±1.36 years old, 47.9% girls. A large proportion of toddlers and preschoolers in Chile
experienced emotional and behavioral changes. Most caregivers reported that children were ‘more
affectionate’ (78.9%), ‘more restless’ (65.1%), and ‘more frustrated’ (54.1%) compared with prepandemic times. Apart from changes in movement behaviors, factors such as child age, caregivers’
age and stress, and residential area (urban/rural) were consistently associated with changes in
emotions and behaviors.
Conclusion: The pandemic substantially affected the emotions and behaviors of toddlers and
preschoolers in Chile. Mental health promotion programs should consider multilevel approaches in
which the promotion of movement behaviors and support for caregivers should be essential pieces
for future responses.
Keywords: physical activity, screen time, sleeping, emotion, coronavirus, stress, children

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic declared
by the World Health Organization (WHO) in
March 2020, has affected millions of inhabitants
in the world in many different ways (1). The Latin
American
region
has
had
devastating
consequences in terms of mortality and the spread
of the disease in 2020, being one of the most
affected areas in the world during the first wave.
Chile accumulated 13,944 deaths from March
until October 27th 2020, placing the country
seventh in the world with 74.5 deaths per 100,000
inhabitants due to COVID-19 (2).
One of the most common measures to control the
spread of the disease was the introduction of
mobility restrictions (i.e., lockdown) and physical
distancing in the population. Despite their
relevance, these measures have affected a wide
range of everyday life dimensions such as work,
education, transport, recreation and household
activities (1, 3). A large proportion of adults faced
financial struggles due to job losses or
suspensions, while children and adolescents
experienced changes in their education, have had
limited their social interactions and less access to
school-based social services beyond education,
such as food and health care (3, 4). These multiple
challenges have likely had a negative impact not
only on people’s physical health but also on their
psychosocial well-being (5).
Stress and social isolation are factors that affect
mental and brain health (6), conditions that may
be aggravated in families suffering health and
economic hardships during the pandemic. Studies
have shown increases in the rates of stress,
depression and anxiety in adults during the
COVID-19
pandemic
(7-10).
Children,
particularly those under the age of five, are not
exempt from consequences of the pandemic (11,
12). They are among the most vulnerable groups
since they are more likely to rely on others
(parental, family, peer or institutional support) to
cope with these challenging circumstances (7, 13,
14). In Spain and Italy, most parents (87.5%)
reported emotional and behavioral changes in
children, and three out of four parents reported
feeling stressed (15) . During the initial stages of
the pandemic in these countries, children
experienced more struggles in concentrating
(76.6%), and were more irritable (39.0%), restless
or nervous (38.0%), manifesting symptoms of
loneliness (31.1%) (15) . In China, children aged

3-6 were more likely to show clinginess and fear
that family members may be sick due to COVID19 compared with older children (16).
Mental health symptoms usually appear in
childhood and then continue into adolescence (1719). It may be expected to observe emotional and
behavioral changes as a reaction of an adverse
event like the pandemic, but these changes may
also be affected by the caregivers’ responses (2023). Studies have shown that toddlers’ and
preschoolers’
behavioral
problems
and
hyperactivity were associated with their parents’
mental health (24). A longitudinal study has also
shown that “proximal risks” (most immediate in
time or close in context to the child) such as
family grief/illness events, harsh discipline,
maternal
emotional
distress,
overinvolved/protective parenting, have the most
considerable effect on externalizing (behaviors)
and internalizing (emotions) symptoms of mental
health in preschoolers (20). These potential risk
factors may be exacerbated during the COVID-19
pandemic as most families are suffering a
contextual change that is transforming family
dynamics. However, even 12 months after the
declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is
limited evidence about emotional responses in
toddlers and preschoolers and how these are
associated with their parents’ feelings or
behavioral responses, particularly in Latin
America.
Movement behaviors (physical activity, sedentary
behavior and sleep) in children have suffered
during the pandemic (25), with the potential of
affecting diverse areas of health and development
(26, 27). Physical activity in preschoolers has
been positively associated with quality of life
related to psychosocial health (28) and with
sociability (29). A longitudinal study has shown
that exposure to prolonged screen time at 6
months of age was a predictor of emotional and
behavioral problems at the age of 4 years (30).
Similarly, another study showed that those who
did not meet WHO Global screen time
recommendations (i.e., more than 1hour of screen
time per day) had more emotional problems (i.e.,
externalizing and internalizing) compared with
preschoolers who met the recommendations (31).
Shorter sleep duration has been associated with
poorer emotional regulation (32). In general
terms, evidence suggests that the more guidelines
children met, the more benefits they may obtain
(31, 33). Using a socioecological perspective, we

aimed to assess the associations between changes
in movement behaviors (physical activity, screen
time and sleep), caregivers’ stress, and
sociodemographic factors with emotional and
behavioral responses in toddlers and preschoolers
using a socioecological perspective during early
stages of the pandemic in Chile.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and procedures
An online survey for main caregivers of 1- to 5year-old children living in Chile was conducted
from March 30th to April 27th, 2020. The study
was promoted online using social networks
(Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram), messaging
apps and emails to educational institutions. The
inclusion criteria were: 1) living in Chile, 2) being
the main caregiver of a 1- to 5-year-old child, and
3) living with the child most of the time before
and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current
study presents the results derived from a second
survey completed by caregivers who participated
in a study which aimed to assess movement
behavior changes during the pandemic. All
participants gave their online informed consent to
participate in the study. The study was approved
by the Scientific Ethics Committee at Universidad
de La Frontera, Chile (ORD.: 009-2020).
The study started two weeks after the Chilean
government enforced educational centers closures
(March 16th, 2020) due to COVID-19 and
finished on April 27th, 2020 when educational
centers were still closed at a national level. Data
were collected and managed using REDCap
(Research Electronic Data Capture) hosted at the
Universidad de La Frontera (34).
Outcome
The emotional changes during early stages of the
pandemic were measured with questions
developed for the context in COVID-19
pandemic. The emotions included in the study
were selected from those commonly reported in
the literature and used in questionnaires such as
the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression
Scale (35) and the Strengths and Difficulties
Questionnaire (36). The main caregivers answered
the following question for ten emotions or
attitudes: “During the last time in the context of
the coronavirus pandemic (lockdown or isolation)
the child has been/had more: affectionate/ restless/
aggressive/ irritable/ temper tantrums/ frustrated/
worried/ sad/ sensitive/ afraid?”. Each question
had a Likert-type response options in a 5-point

scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree), with
an additional option for “not applicable”. The
questionnaires were piloted in a small sample of
caregivers before its official launch to assess
pertinence, readability and understanding of the
items. The questions related to emotional changes
had a good internal consistency (Cronbach’s
alpha: 0.88). The questionnaire is included in the
supplementary files.
Movement behaviors
Caregivers were also asked to estimate total
physical activity, screen time, sleep duration on a
typical day before and during early stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep quality both before
and during the COVID-19 pandemic was asked
using a scale from 1 to 7 in which a higher score
indicated better quality. These questions were
adapted from previously tested questions from the
International Study of Movement Behaviors in the
Early Years (SUNRISE study, www.sunrisestudy.com) to capture the the unique features of
the pandemic (37, 38). The changes in these
behaviors during early stages of the pandemic
were calculated using a residualized change score
approach to eliminate auto-correlated errors and
regression towards the mean.(39, 40) Thus, first,
each behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic
was regressed on the behavior before the COVID19. Then, the residualized change score (i.e.,
trend) for each behavior was estimated as each
participant's standardized residual score. A
positive residualized change score indicates an
increase in the specific behavior from the time
before COVID-19 and a negative score indicates a
decrease.
Covariates
Sociodemographic information included sex,
child’s and caregiver’s age, caregiver’s change in
working condition due to the pandemic (yes/no,
being fired or salary decreased), caregiver’s stress
during the pandemic (more irritable, more tired,
having difficulties to concentrate, having
difficulties to work; scale 1 to 5 [never to
always]). The items are included in the
supplementary file. The questions related to
caregivers’ stress had acceptable internal
consistency (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.79). Family
characteristics included family income (<530
United States Dollars [USD]; ≥530-<1830 USD,
≥1830 USD), main caregiver’s level of education,
number of people per home, and number of
children per home. Home characteristics included
dwelling type (house, apartment or other), squared

meters per person at home (<11.7 m2 per person,
≥11.7 to <18.3 m2 per person, ≥18.3 to <25 m2 per
person, and ≥25 m2 per person), space to play at
home (yes/no), living area (urban/rural) and living
in an area under lockdown (yes/no).
Statistical analysis
Mean (standard deviation, SD) and proportions
were used to describe the participants’
characteristics.
Comparisons
between
participants’ characteristics and outcomes by sex
were performed using t-tests and chi-squared test.
Multiple linear regressions were used to assess the
association between different factors and
emotional changes in toddlers and preschoolers
during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
All models were mutually adjusted individual,
caregivers, family, home and geographic
characteristics describe above. All data were
analyzed using Stata 15.1 (StataCorp LLC, USA).
P values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant (tested 2-sided).
RESULTS
In total, 1727 caregivers provided complete data
on emotional changes for children. The mean age
was 2.9±1.36 years, and comprised 47.9% girls,
corresponding to a 54.7% of those who completed
the first stage of this study that included questions
on movement behaviors (n=3157). No differences
were observed in the sample characteristics with
the original sample. Children reduced their
physical activity, increased their screen time and
declined their sleep quality during early stages of
the pandemic. About 60 per cent of caregivers
were 25- to 34-years-old and about 40%
experienced changes in their working conditions.
On a scale from 1 to 5, with a higher score
indicating worse outcome, caregivers scored
3.4±1.06 for being more irritable, 3.7±1.12 for
being more tired, 3.5±1.18 for having difficulties
to concentrate, and 3.4 (1.41) for having
difficulties with work. Family characteristics were
comparable with those observed in the National
Census for the corresponding age group in terms
of dwelling (80.6% vs 79.7% living in a house)
and living area (10.8% vs 13.5% living in a rural
area), but the current sample was more educated
(68.1% vs 39.7% with more than 12 years of
education) (41). About 80% participants were in
lockdown when the questionnaire was completed.
More details about the sample are shown in Table
1.

Emotional
changes
in
toddlers
and
preschoolers
Figure 1 shows the proportion of children that
showed emotional changes during early stages of
the pandemic in Chile. Most caregivers reported
that children were “more affectionate” (78.9%),
“more restless” (65.1%), and “more frustrated”
(54.1%) compared with pre-pandemic times. The
less frequently reported emotional changes were
“more sad” (23.4%), “more worried” (35.5) and
“more afraid” (31.9%). The only differences
according to sex were observed for “more
aggressive” (40.5% in boys vs 35.2% in girls,
p=0.032) and “more sensitive” (48.5% in boys vs
52.6% in girls, p=0.024).
Factors associated with emotional changes in
toddlers and preschoolers
Table 2 shows the results from the multivariable
linear regression models in which different factors
were associated with emotional changes in
children during early stages of the COVID-19
pandemic in Chile. At individual level, being boy
was associated with increases in aggressiveness
and irritability. Older children were less likely to
show increases in restlessness, irritability, temper
tantrums, but at the same time they were more
worried, sad and afraid than younger children.
Children who were less affected in physical
activity levels were more affectionate and less
irritable, worried, sensitive and afraid (Table 2).
Those who had greater increases in their screen
time were more likely to be more aggressive,
irritable, have temper tantrums, frustrated and
sensitive. Children who increased their sleep
duration were more affectionate and less
aggressive, angry and sad. Children whose sleep
quality was less affected were less likely to be
restless, aggressive, irritable, have temper
tantrums, frustrated, worried, sad, sensitive and
afraid.
Caregivers who were 45 years and older reported
that children were less likely to be more restless,
aggressive, irritable and had fewer temper
tantrums, while caregivers who were 35 years and
older reported less frustration in children (Table
2). Irritability from caregivers was positively
associated with all the measured emotions except
for affection. Tiredness from caregivers was
positively associated with aggressiveness,
frustration, sadness and sensitivity, and fear.
Those caregivers who reported more difficulties

for concentrating had children who were more
affectionate, sad and sensitive.
When observing the family characteristics (Table
3), those children from wealthier families were
less likely to be worried and sad. Children who
lived with five or more people were more restless.
In contrast, those who lived with three or more
children were less likely to be restless. Children
who lived in homes with between 18.3 m2 and 25
m2 per person were less likely to be more
aggressive. Those who lived in rural areas were
less restless, irritable, frustrated and sensitive, and
had fewer temper tantrums. Children who were
under lockdown measures were less likely to be
sad and afraid.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this is the first study in Latin
America that has reported the impact of the
pandemic on emotions and behaviors among
toddlers and preschoolers. This study has shown
that a large proportion of toddlers and
preschoolers in Chile experienced emotional and
behavioral changes during the early stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Several variables were
consistently associated with emotional changes in
toddlers and preschoolers such as child’s age,
changes in movement behaviors in the child,
caregivers’ age, caregiver’s irritability, and
residential area. Some family and home
characteristics such as family income and number
of inhabitants per home were also associated with
emotional changes but less consistently than the
other factors. The presence of lockdown was
inversely associated with children being more sad
and afraid.
Our study showed that during early stages of the
pandemic child’s and caregiver’s characteristics
were more consistently associated with emotional
changes in toddlers and preschoolers than family,
home and geographic characteristics. As shown in
other studies (28-32), physical activity, screen
time and sleep duration and quality were
associated with emotions in children, highlighting
the importance of ensuring opportunities to
maintain healthy movement behaviors. These
results capture early stages of the pandemic,
therefore, some of these associations may have
changed as the mobility restriction measures to
control the spread of the virus were maintained
during the development of the year 2020. The
rapid affectation of healthy movement behaviors

and the stress associated with this context may
have negative effects not only in the emotional
but also cognitive development in children (42,
43). In line with international recommendations
(26, 44), these findings suggest that healthy
movement behaviors should be a key component
in actions designed for enhancing psychosocial
health in early childhood and prevent other
deleterious effects of the pandemic.
Among the caregiver’s characteristics, the study
showed
associations
between
caregiver’s
irritability, tiredness and difficulties to
concentrate with changes in most child’s emotions
and behaviors. Similarly, during the pandemic,
other studies have reported how parental distress
has been associated with children’s emotions and
behaviors (45, 46). During the first months of the
pandemic, our results show that changes in
working conditions for the caregivers due to the
pandemic were not associated with emotional
responses in children, but this may have changed
as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. A
number of family and home characteristics were
associated with emotional changes in toddlers and
preschoolers, highlighting the importance of the
emotional support or interaction that children
receive from their caregivers. These findings
reinforce the need for implementing supporting
strategies for caregivers as most of them reported
increases in emotional stress, and it is likely to be
maintained or worsened (47). However, programs
should be supportive not only at individual level
but also through comprehensive approaches in
which communities, employers and decisionmakers should understand and empathize with
caregivers (mainly women in Chile). A model
similar to that used in the “Sistema Distrital del
Cuidado” (District system of care in English) in
Bogotá (48), Colombia, that was not developed
during COVID-19 pandemic, may be used as a
starting point as it focused on providing
opportunities for reducing the burden of care,
particularly in women, while offering educational
and health care activities, among others, for the
users.
Living in rural areas was frequently associated
with fewer emotional changes in children. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, living in rural areas was
also reported as a factor positively related to
smaller decreases in physical activity, declines in
sleep quality and increases in screen time (25). In

this line, a study conducted in 14 countries
showed that preschoolers that were able to go
outside during the pandemic were more likely to
meet the PA guidelines (49). Thus, to compensate
for the lack of this protective effect, strategies in
urban contexts should provide opportunities to
access green spaces or open spaces to play while
considering physical distancing due to the
pandemic. This is particularly relevant in
countries like Chile in which the opening of
public and national parks has been postponed for
months during the pandemic, whereas commercial
areas have remained opened (50). Evidence has
shown that green spaces enhance wellbeing,
overall health and cognitive development in
children (51-54). More specifically, Aggio et al.
have reported that children who lived further from
green and open spaces tended to watch more
television and had worse mental health (55).
Actions to promote healthy movement behaviors
in urban areas such as open streets programs
should be implemented to mitigate the lack of
access to green and open spaces observed in most
places not only during the pandemic but also in
potential post-pandemic times (56, 57).
We acknowledge that more factors may contribute
to the emotional and behavioral changes during
the pandemic. However, strategies to mitigate the
negative socioemotional issues derived from the
pandemic should include multilevel approaches
for promoting more physical activity, less screen
time and more and better sleep quality (25, 58).
Policies must consider toddlers and preschoolers
in their design and impact assessment due to a
year in pandemic in the life of them is expected to
have more considerable impact on their future
development than in adults (43, 58, 59). More
extensive efforts are required to manage the
collateral effects of the pandemic on mental health
as a recent report from WHO showed that a large
proportion of member states have mental health
and psychological support plans, but only about a
fifth of them have secured additional funding for
covering the activities (1).
Strengths and limitations
Our study has explored the emotional and
behavioral changes in toddlers and preschoolers
using a socioecological perspective, including the
main caregiver’s distress (most of them women).
This is critical in a pandemic context in which
supporting networks (educational community,

childcare services, families, friends, etc.) are
limited and caring responsibilities rely on fewer
individuals. Although this was a cross-sectional
study, under the circumstances of a natural
experiment, we have provided evidence on a topic
that is not frequently explored in the area of
movement behaviors, which is mainly focused on
physical health (60). However, there are
limitations in our study. The cross-sectional
design of the study limits causality. Also, the selfand proxy-reports used in this study may have
been affected by different sources of bias such as
recall or social desirability. Our study may have
recruited caregivers who would have been more
concerned regarding their family’s health,
including emotions and movement behaviors,
affecting the composition of our sample. Although
we used commonly used and freely available
social networks to recruit participants throughout
the entire country, the final sample was not
entirely representative. The sample was more
educated than that observed in the census for the
same age group, but it was comparable in terms of
dwelling type and living area (41). We recruited a
large sample, but unfortunately for this section of
this study only 55% completed the questionnaire,
but the characteristics of the sample of the current
study were not different from those who
completed the section on movement behaviors
(25). The lower participation can be explained as
people may be more reluctant to provide personal
information through online methods compared
with face-to-face methodologies. We used the best
possible option to measure the variables included
in the study as strict health and ethical restrictions
were mandated during the early stages of the
pandemic (61), limiting, for example, the use of
accelerometers or other instruments that may have
required contact with volunteers. To overcome
some of these limitations, ongoing studies should
explore longitudinal associations between
different exposure variables and mental health
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
The study showed that a large of proportion of
toddlers and preschoolers in Chile suffered
emotional and behavioral changes during the early
stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes
were consistently associated with individual
factors such as child’s age, decrease in physical
activity and sleep duration, increase in screen time
and decline in sleep quality. Caregivers’

characteristics, including age and irritability, were
also associated with emotional changes during the
pandemic. Living in rural areas was a consistent
factor associated with less marked changes in
emotions and behaviors. Mental health promotion
programs should consider comprehensive and
multilevel approaches in which movement
behaviors should be an essential piece for the
interventions. The findings suggest that
supportive actions for caregivers may have a
positive impact not only on adults but also on
children. Governments should highlight the
importance of healthy movement behaviors in
their messages during pandemic and post
pandemic times not only through strong
campaigns but also by providing environmental
changes to facilitate more physical activity, less
screen time and more and better sleep in toddlers
and preschoolers.
