Abstract
Aim
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant
challenges to healthcare globally, necessitating rapid restructuring of service provision. This
questionnaire survey was conducted amongst adult heart failure (HF) patients in the United
Kingdom (UK), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon HF services.

Methods and Results
The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF), a UK HF
patient charity. “Survey Monkey” was used to disseminate the questionnaire in the PMF’s
online patient group and in 10 UK hospitals (out-patient hospital and community HF clinics).
1050 responses were collected (693/1050-66% women); 55% (579/1050) were aged over 60
years. Anxiety level was significantly higher regarding COVID19 (mean 7±2.5 on anxiety
scale of 0 to 10) compared to anxiety regarding HF (6.1±2.4; p<0.001). Anxiety was higher
amongst patients aged ≤60 years about HF (6.3±2.2 versus 5.9±2.5 in those aged >60 years;
p=0.005) and COVID-19 (7.3±2.3 versus 6.7±2.6 those aged >60 years; p<0.001). 65%
respondents (686/1050) reported disruption to HF appointments (cancellation or
postponement) during the lockdown period. 37% reported disruption to medication
prescription services and 34% reported inability to access their HF teams promptly. 32%
expressed reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated they would only attend hospital if there
was no alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all).

Conclusions
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant anxiety amongst HF patients
regarding COVID-19 and HF. Cancellation or postponement of scheduled clinic
appointments, investigations, procedures, prescription and monitoring services were
implicated as sources of anxiety.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). COVID-19 evolved into an international public
health crisis rapidly after being discovered in December 2019, and was declared a pandemic
by the World Health Organisation on March 11, 2020 (2). In the United Kingdom (UK) the
accelerating pace of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the British government issuing a
public lockdown from the 23rd of March (3) and a rapid shift in the focus of care in the
National Health Service (NHS) ensued. Lockdown measures were first eased in England
from May 13, 2020 (4), whereas other devolved UK nations eased lockdown measures more
slowly (for example Scotland from May 28th onwards).
The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge to healthcare
resources throughout the world. Hospitals rapidly restructured services in order to enable
them to cope with the predicted high numbers of COVID-19 patients. This led to the

cancellation or postponement of elective appointments, and both inpatient as well as
outpatient services were restricted to prioritise urgent cases. In particular, elective face to
face appointments were reduced significantly and the threshold for admitting patients
increased (5) in order to minimise the risk of exposure to COVID-19 to at-risk groups such as
those with underlying cardiovascular conditions (6). In addition to this, patients have also
been reluctant to attend hospital due to self-isolation, fear of contracting infection and also
perhaps a mis-interpretation of government guidance that healthcare services are not open for
non-COVID-19 healthcare including emergencies (7). This trend has been reflected in the
significantly reduced hospitalisation rates for several acute cardiovascular conditions (8) such
as acute coronary syndrome (9-11) as well as acute HF during the ongoing pandemic in the
UK (12, 13) but also in other parts of the world (14, 15), with these results suggesting a 50%
reduction in acute HF hospitalisations during the first wave of the pandemic. HF patients also
received seemingly conflicting advice, with initial communication from Public Health
England (PHE) advising that they were amongst those at increased risk of severe illness from
COVID-19 (16), however subsequent communication excluded HF patients from the list of
patients with chronic conditions classed as “clinically extremely vulnerable” (17).
The primary aim of this HF patient study was to ascertain the impact of the COVID19 lockdown upon adult HF patient care. The pandemic response has also prompted a rapid
evolution of service delivery such as the use of virtual clinics (using telephone/video
technology), remote monitoring and ambulatory care. The Heart Failure Society of America
and the European Society of Cardiology both recommend the use of tele-health strategies
such as virtual clinics (remote consultation using telephone or video technology) and remote
monitoring of patient health parameters (weight, pulse, blood pressure) as alternatives to
minimise the need for in-hospital visits (18, 19) and recent evidence during the pandemic has
also suggested that telemedicine can have beneficial outcomes in HF (5, 20). However, it is

currently unclear whether the full spectrum of service reconfiguration is acceptable as well as
accessible to patients and there is currently a lack of feedback regarding patients’ opinions
about suitability of various tele-health strategies. We therefore incorporated patient feedback
regarding service innovations into our survey and also sought to gauge HF patients’
preferences regarding the newer models of care that they would like to see incorporated into
or continued in their local HF services.

Methods
The survey was conducted by the Pumping Marvellous Foundation (PMF) which is
the UK’s largest patient-led heart failure charity. PMF is funded via donations and
fundraising by individuals, with support from the NHS and charitable organisations together
with corporate sponsorship. A HF Patient Survey Working Group was constituted in May
2020, consisting of 3 HF patients, 6 HF cardiologists, 1 HF advanced nurse practitioner and 1
HF nurse consultant. The HF patient survey working group devised the survey questionnaire
(supplementary material).
The anonymous questionnaire survey was disseminated from June 15th 2020 to Aug
10, 2020 to approximately 7000 adult HF patients. One mode of dissemination was through
the online survey tool Survey Monkey, on the Pumping Marvellous Closed Online Patient
Group. The other was by handing out 4000 cards (containing Quick Response (QR) codes
with links to the survey) to HF patients who attended out-patient clinics or community heart
failure clinics affiliated to 10 participating hospitals in the UK.
HF patients were asked to rate their anxiety about HF and COVID19 on a scale of 0
(no anxiety) to 10 (highest anxiety level). The survey also consisted of questions regarding

the impact of COVID-19 lockdown upon out-patient HF clinic appointments (hospital as well
as community HF services), cardiac investigations, procedures and access to medications as
well as HF counselling. Opinions were also sought regarding preference for service changes
enforced by the pandemic. Statistical comparisons were performed based on gender and age
groups (patients aged up to 60 years versus those aged more than 60 years).

Statistical Analysis
For the descriptive statistics of our patient population, we represent continuous
variables as means with standard deviations (mean ± SD) when normally distributed and
compared using a Student’s T test. For non-normal data, the parameters are described using
medians with interquartile ranges and compared using Mann –Whitney test. Categorical data
are expressed as percentages and compared using the chi-square test.

Results
A total of 1050 adult heart failure patients and carers were surveyed from England
(80%, 840) Scotland (10%, 100), Wales (8%, 87) and Northern Ireland (2%, 23). The
majority of survey respondents (696 out of 1050 -66%) were female and 55% (579/1050)
were aged more than 60 years. Comprehensive patient demographics are detailed in Table 1.
The survey respondents reported a significantly higher degree of anxiety regarding
COVID19 in comparison to anxiety regarding HF itself (mean 7 ±2.5 on the anxiety scale
versus 6.1 ± 2.4; p<0.001). This trend was similar amongst patient sub-groups based on
gender (males HF anxiety score 6.0 ± 2.2 vs. COVID anxiety score 7 ±2.5; p<0.001 and

females HF anxiety score 6.1 ± 2.4 vs. COVID anxiety score 7 ± 2.4; p<0.001) as well as age
groups i.e., patients aged up to 60 years versus those aged more than 60 years.
65% (686/1050) of all respondents reported that their heart failure appointments were
negatively impacted during the lockdown period of the COVID19 pandemic with 43%
cancellation of scheduled hospital clinic appointments (321/743 appointments) and 22%
cancellation of community HF clinic appointments (114/523) (Figure 1). Cardiac
investigations (echocardiogram, holter monitoring, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging,
cardiac computed tomography scans) or procedures (angioplasty, pacemaker, cardiac bypass
operation and radiofrequency ablation) were also affected with 37% (362 out of 994)
appointments cancelledand46% (460/994) postponed (Figure 2). As shown in figure 2, the
most commonly cancelled investigation was cardiac MRI (112 reported cancellations) and
the most commonly cancelled procedure was pacemaker implantation (38 cancellations). The
most commonly postponed investigation was the holter monitor test (101), and procedure was
pacemaker implantation (60 postponements). The most frequently performed investigation or
procedure during this period was echocardiography (117). 29% (305/1050) of respondents
reported that their appointments for HF counselling were cancelled.
37% (389/1050) of HF patients reported that their medication prescription was
adversely affected by the pandemic and 34% (357/1050) reported that they could not access
their HF services/teams promptly. The majority of patients (68%) reported a willingness to
attend hospital appointments if required (18% responded that they would have no concerns
attending hospital and 50% stated that they would attend hospital if there were appropriate
measures to ensure patient safety, such as social distancing, availability of masks, handsanitisation facilities). However, nearly a third of HF patients surveyed (32%) reported a
reluctance to attend hospital (25% stated that they would only attend hospital if there was no
alternative and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all).

Respondents were also asked to choose service changes or new models of care that
they would prefer to be continued or to be introduced in their local HF services (Figure 4).
An overwhelming majority (71%) chose the “One stop diagnostic HF clinics”, consisting of a
single visit incorporating HF consultant review and echocardiography. With regards to
alternatives to physical attendance at HF clinics, telephone consultations were more popular
(52% preferred this option) in comparison to video consultation (preferred by 34%). 36% of
HF patients stated that they would prefer home intravenous diuretic therapy as an alternative
to hospital admission and 29% preferred ambulatory or outpatient intravenous treatment. 51%
of patients preferred to have their blood pressure, pulse and weight monitored at home
(“home-monitoring”).
Survey responses were further analysed based on age groups (age ≤60 years versus >
60 years) and this is illustrated in detail in Table 2. There was a greater degree of anxiety
amongst younger patients (aged ≤60 years) versus older patients (aged>60 years) both for HF
(6.3 ± 2.2 vs. 5.9 ± 2.5; p=0.005) as well as for COVID-19 (7.3 ± 2.3 vs. 6. 7± 2.6;
p=0.0003). Whilst HF patients aged ≤60 years had a higher number of appointments
scheduled (2.5 ± 1.6) compared to older patients (1.8 ± 1.2; p<0.001), younger patients also
reported a higher proportion of disruption (cancellations or postponement) to clinic
appointments as well as appointments for investigations/procedures in comparison to older
patients (73% of patients in the group ≤60 years vs. 59% in the group aged >60 years;
p<0.001). It is therefore possible that the higher degree of anxiety was influenced by the fact
that patients aged≤ 60 years experienced a significantly higher proportion of appointment
cancellations (hospital and community) as well as disruptions to medication prescription or
monitoring. Older patients (age>60 years) were extremely wary of attending hospital with
34% opting to only attend hospital if there was no alternative or to not attend hospital at all,
in comparison to 26% of patients aged ≤60 years who expressed this view (p=0.004).

There was also a significant difference in terms of preference for newer models of HF
services between the two age groups compared, with these service changes seemingly less
popular amongst older HF patients (aged >60 years).

Discussion
Our questionnaire-based adult HF patient survey is the first reported study which
describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period upon HF services from a
patient perspective in all four devolved nations in the UK. Our results show high anxiety
levels particularly regarding COVID-19 and especially amongst younger patients. It is likely
that this was exacerbated by the cancellation or postponement of a large proportion of clinic
appointments (hospital as well as community), elective investigations and procedures, with
the majority of survey respondents (65%) reporting that their HF appointments were
adversely affected through cancellation or postponement. Whilst reassuringly the majority of
respondents surveyed reported that they felt able to access their HF services, it is of great
concern that over a third of patients reported that they had difficulties accessing their local
HF services or obtaining HF medications.
A number of studies have shown a significant reduction in admissions due to HF
during the 1st peak of COVID-19 (12, 14, 21). As demonstrated by our study, possible
reasons for this include a reluctance or unwillingness to attend hospital (this was seen
especially amongst the older patient group aged>60 years in our study), due to anxiety
amongst HF patients about contracting COVID-19 in hospital as well as a perception that
clinical services were only open to treat COVID-19 cases. This is reflected in our survey

responses which showed higher anxiety levels regarding COVID-19 in comparison to anxiety
about HF. High anxiety levels have been independently correlated with adverse HF outcomes
in previous studies (22). Interestingly despite older people having a predilection for more
severe COVID-19 illness, anxiety levels were greater amongst the younger group of patients
(aged up to 60 years). This is contrary to the common perception that older patients are likely
to experience more anxiety due to a combination of social isolation as well as fear of
contracting severe COVID-19 illness. This paradoxical result may be in part due to the
greater degree of disruption to clinic appointments and monitoring, as well as interruption to
HF medication prescriptions amongst younger patients. In addition, it is also possible that
younger patients feared hospitalisation or dying more than older people and were perturbed
about the possible impact of COVID-19 upon their family or dependents such as school age
children. Other possible reasons for greater apprehension amongst younger HF patients could
have been related to specific financial concerns, fear of being made unemployed or feeling
pressurised to work in environments where physical distancing was difficult to achieve.
Patients with a new diagnosis of HF typically undergo an armamentarium of
diagnostic investigations, followed by appropriate guideline directed management through
timely follow-up. Cancellation or postponement of these appointments can lead to HF
decompensation, worsening of quality of life and also increase patients’ anxiety levels
regarding accessibility of HF services, risk of hospitalisation or dying prematurely thereby
triggering a vicious cycle. Delays in optimisation of prognostic HF medications,
investigations and procedural treatments, are likely to lead to worse HF outcomes such as
acute decompensation, worsening of quality of life and increased mortality.
Significantly, around one third of HF patients in our survey expressed a reluctance to
attend hospital (25% stated that they would only attend hospital if there was no alternative
and 7% stated that they would not attend hospital at all). The prevalence of this viewpoint

was significantly higher amongst the older patient group (aged >60 years). Mixed messages
regarding isolation or shielding may have caused confusion, leading to indecision amongst
HF patients about accessing healthcare services. This may have contributed to the
significantly lower hospital admission rates for HF during the pandemic (12, 13), but also to
the worse outcomes in the form of higher mortality (13). It is crucial therefore that healthcare
services reach out to all patients, with reassurances that adequate precautions are being taken
in healthcare settings (such as physical distancing, use of hand-washing/sanitising facilities
and personal protective equipment), in order to minimise the risk of transmission of
coronavirus to patients in healthcare settings.
The response to the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a rapid restructuring of healthcare
services with an increased use of and reliance on tele-cardiology services. The data available
on the tele-management of cardiology patients is conflicting. Whilst some trials have shown
beneficial end points (23, 24), others have suggested a lack of improvement in outcomes (25,
26). Our survey results offer the first published report of adult HF patients’ opinions
regarding the acceptance and preference for ongoing continuation of these newer service
models. Overall, the ‘one-stop diagnostic HF clinic’ was the most popular service preference
with over 70% of respondents opting for it to be continued. This concept minimises the need
for repeat HF clinic attendances by incorporating echocardiography and HF specialist review
during the same consultation, thereby improving patient convenience and possibly reducing
risk of exposure to COVID by minimising hospital/healthcare facility attendance. This is also
the objective of other services such home monitoring (blood pressure, pulse, weight), home
treatment or ambulatory treatment with intravenous diuretics and virtual clinics (using
telephone or video technology). However, these newer service models appeared to be less
popular with patients, particularly with older patients. This is a pivotal finding of the study,
with possible far-reaching consequences because HF patients are frequently elderly and have

a significant number of existing co-morbidities (27).Virtual or remote consultations can be
challenging for health care providers to deliver due to the inability to conduct a physical
examination, communication barriers with patients who have hearing impairment, reduced
opportunity for consultation input from carers and language barriers. Potential solutions
include the use of tele-health home monitoring of parameters such as pulse, blood pressure,
heart rate and weight, educating patients to self-examine for the presence/absence of fluid
overload and use of multi-participant teleconference technology or loudspeaker function at
the patient facing side of the consultation to help include carers and interpreters in the
consultation process. It is therefore crucial that HF services engage with their patients to codesign and evaluate novel services prior to widespread implementation. This should include a
comprehensive understanding of: patient access barriers; acceptability of novel services;
patient preferences; and local geographic and socio-economic challenges that may exist, so
that patient care can be delivered with parity.
To date, this is the 1st reported HF patient survey that explores the direct impact of
COVID-19 upon adult HF patient care, from a patient perspective. This study has several
strengths including but not limited to a large sample size distributed across 10 hospitals in the
UK with inclusion of a wide range of ages from all four nations in the UK. The study also
benefits from having been undertaken during the final phases of the UK lockdown. This
allowed us to capture a more complete picture of any disruptions that HF patients may have
experienced during this time period. Importantly, the results should inform adult HF service
transformation and resilience strategies in the event of a second pandemic wave, including
the adoption of an approach that maintains elective services for people whose underlying
health condition places them at high risk of hospitalisation or premature death. Such an
approach has the potential to minimise the anxiety and disruption to care, experienced by HF
patients.

Limitations
General limitations exist when using a survey questionnaire study model. Such
limitations are applicable to this study including the potential for responder bias and a
response rate of approximately 15%. It is possible that non-responders experienced no
disruption to their appointments during the pandemic or conversely, that they were either
unable to access the technology to complete the survey or were not aware of the survey due
to lack of contact with their HF team.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique inflection point in healthcare provision
and required a rapid response from healthcare systems in order to cope with the burgeoning
demand created by a new multisystem condition. We are already experiencing further waves
of this pandemic across several geographical areas. Our survey results highlight that patients
with chronic health conditions such as heart failure need to feel reassured that health care
services can respond in a timely and robust manner when treating them, whilst also being
able to cope with the burden created by COVID-19.It is likely that the resulting healthcare
disruptions for non-COVID conditions in multiple countries, led to the public concluding that
healthcare facilities were “COVID-19 Hospitals” and therefore less able to look after them.
This, in combination with a real-world reduction in services offered, possibly resulted in
patients feeling that they could not rely on the services they had previously relied upon and
had confidence in. It is important that healthcare authorities regain the trust of patients with
chronic conditions such as HF, through firm reassurance that healthcare services are ready
and capable of coping with the extra demand created by COVID-19. However, this requires
to be balanced with competing demands on other services. The results of our nationwide HF

patient survey should influence the future direction of adult HF care in the event of future
waves of COVID-19 and help optimise service delivery under these exceptional
circumstances, in order to minimise disruption to patient care.
