Abstract
Background: The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
in March 2020 created unprecedented challenges in the provision of scheduled
ambulatory cancer care. As a result, there has been a renewed focus on video
consultations as a means to continue ambulatory care.
Objective: To analyze the change in video visit volume at the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 and
compare demographics/appointment data from January 1, 2020 and in the 11 weeks
after transition to video visits.
Methods: Patient demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and
departments) were abstracted from the Electronic Health Record reporting database.
Video visits were performed using a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform with
a pre-existing workflow.
Results: In 17 departments and divisions at the UCSF Cancer Center, 2,284 video
visits were performed in the 11 weeks before COVID-19 changes with an average (SD)
of 208 (75) per week and 12,946 video visits were performed in the 11 week postCOVID-19 period with an average (SD) of 1,177 (120) per week. The proportion of
video visits increased from 7-18% to 54-72%, between the pre- and post-COVID-19
periods without any disparity based on race/ethnicity, primary language, or payor.
Conclusions: In a remarkably brief period of time, we rapidly scaled the utilization of
telehealth in response to COVID-19 and maintained access to complex oncologic care
at a time of social distancing.

Introduction
The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United
States in March 2020 created unprecedented challenges in the provision of scheduled
healthcare and, in particular, ambulatory cancer care. The rapid spread of COVID-19
has renewed focus on telehealth [1], including video consultations [2], as a means of
continuing ambulatory care without increasing the risk of potential exposure for patients,
clinicians, and staff.

Telehealth is the provision of healthcare remotely by means of a variety of
telecommunication platforms such as messaging, audio, and video [3]. While the use of
telehealth to deliver cancer care is not new [4] and has already been well described [5],
delivering it at the current scale as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is
unprecedented.

The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Health established a Telehealth
Program in 2015 and offers video visits in all practices. In response to the evolving
pandemic, leadership challenged the organization to transition all in-person clinic visits,
beginning March 15, 2020, to video visits with exceptions only for specific, urgent cases.

In this study, we analyze the change in video visit volume at the UCSF Comprehensive
Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 and compare demographics/appointment data
from January 1, 2020 and in the 11 weeks after transition to video visits.

Methods
Demographics and appointment data (dates, visit types, and departments) were
abstracted from the Electronic Health Record reporting database. The pre-COVID-19
period was defined as the 11 weeks from January 1 to March 13, 2020, prior to the
transition, and the post-COVID-19 period as the 11 weeks following the transition to
video visits on March 16, 2020 up to May 31, 2020. All video visits were performed
using a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform (Zoom Video Communications
Inc, San Jose, CA) with a pre-existing workflow (Figure 1). R version 3.5.3, was used for
analysis [6] and a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
In the pre-COVID-19 period from January 1 to March 13, 2020, there were a total of
23,988 ambulatory care episodes, with an average (SD) of 2,181 (522) per week across
17 departments and divisions at the UCSF Cancer Center (Figure 2). During this period,
a total 2,284 video visits were performed with an average (SD) of 208 (75) video visits
being performed per week. The proportion of video visits ranged from 7-18% whereas
the proportion of in-person visits ranged from 76-86% (Figure 3). In the post-COVID-19
period from March 16 to May 31, 2020, there was a total of 20,567 ambulatory care
episodes, with an average (SD) of 1,870 (200) per week. A total of 12,946 video visits
were performed in the post-COVID-19 period, with an average (SD) of 1,177 (120) per
week. The proportion of video visits increased to 54-72%. The proportion of episodes
during which a procedure was performed ranged from 4-7% in the pre-COVID-19 period
and 1-5% in the post-COVID-19 period.

Table 1 shoes the demographic data of the 2,284 patients who had a video visit in the
pre-COVID-19 period and the 12,946 patients who had a video visit in the post-COVID19 period. In the post COVID-19 period, more Black/African Americans (4.1% vs 3.4%;
p<0.001), Hispanic/Latino (11.2% vs 9.4%; p<0.001) and Asians (14.7% vs 8.6%;
p<0.001) received care via video visits compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. There
was increased post-COVID-19 utilization of video visits for patients in urban areas
(92.8% vs 88.7%; p<0.001). We did not find any difference in the insurance status of
patients using video visits during either period. In the post COVID-19 period, first clinic
encounter (24.9% vs 18.3%; p <0.001) and MD-provided visits (81.8% vs 67.3%; p
<0.001) increased.

Discussion
We demonstrate a rapid expansion (from <20% to 72%) in telehealth use in a
Comprehensive Cancer Center over a remarkably brief time period in response to
COVID-19 without differences by race or insurance. Medicare telehealth visits have
increased by more than 25% annually for the past decade [7], yet absolute adoption
numbers remain low and fragmented with concerns about potentiating disparities in
healthcare access [8]. The vast majority of cancer care cannot be delayed and the
COVID-19 pandemic has presented new challenges that telehealth is uniquely situated
to solve. Changes that would typically encompass months of planning, pilot testing, and
education have been compressed into days. The use of telehealth has grown

exponentially with some practices transitioning to near-complete virtual care in as little
as a few days [9-11].

Several factors have likely enabled the rapid expansion of video visits at our institution.
First, we had an established telehealth structure and workflow familiar to providers and
practice staff. Second, UCSF made a strategic decision to provide Relative Value Unit
(wRVU) credit to providers for telehealth visits since 2015, irrespective of payer
reimbursement. Third, new regulatory changes at federal and state level as a response
to COVID-19 have reduced barriers, including the ability to see new patients (including
Medicare beneficiaries) without a prior in-person visit to establish care and
reimbursement for telehealth encounters by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) at parity with in-person visits beginning March 17, 2020 [12]. Finally,
CMS now permits providers licensed in any state to provide telehealth services across
the country [13].

There are a number of limitations of this study which need to be acknowledged. We did
not evaluate the outcome of the video visits including patient satisfaction, qualitative or
clinical outcomes. The study is from a single, large urban academic cancer center in the
US and our findings may not be generalizable to other specialties, practices or
locations. We believe this is the first report of the utilization of video visits in a
Comprehensive Cancer Center in response to COVID-19 with a detailed description of
the changing demographic of patients utilizing video visits before and after the COVID19 pandemic.

Conclusions
Overall, the proportion of video visits increased from 7-18% to 54-72%, between the
pre- and post-COVID-19 periods whilst maintaining access to complex oncologic care at
a time of social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to radically rethink
and change our cancer care delivery models. In many health systems, there will
undoubtedly be many lessons learned from this “natural experiment”, which has the
potential to permanently change care delivery patterns.
