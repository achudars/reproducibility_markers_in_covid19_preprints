Abstract
The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In response,
governments have implemented measures to slow transmission through “social distancing.”
However, the practice of social distancing may depend on prevailing socioeconomic conditions
and beliefs. Using 15–17 million anonymized cell phone records, we find that lower per capita
income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced social
distancing among U.S. counties. These associations persisted after adjusting for county-level
sociodemographic and labor market characteristics as well as state fixed effects. These results
may help policymakers and health professionals identify communities that are most vulnerable
to transmission and direct resources and communications accordingly.

Introduction
The U.S. is the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.1
Modeling studies suggest that, without mitigation efforts, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases
may overwhelm the health system’s capacity and result in millions of deaths.2 As a result,
federal, state, and local governments have implemented a patchwork of public health measures
to slow transmission through “social distancing.” These measures include orders to stay home
and close schools and non-essential businesses. The effectiveness of social distancing policies
requires significant engagement from communities. However, communities may face barriers to
successfully adhere to these policies depending on prevailing socioeconomic conditions and
political beliefs.3 This study examines the socioeconomic and political determinants of
engagement in social distancing among U.S. counties.

Methods
We obtained data on social distancing from Unacast, who measure county-level
averages of distance traveled per person, based on 15–17 million anonymous cell phone users
per day. Adherence to social distancing was conceptualized as changes in average distance
traveled for March 19–28, 2020 (most recent data available), relative to matched days of a preCOVID-19 reference week. The validity of this distancing measure is confirmed by the sharp
decrease after declaration of a national emergency for COVID-19 (Figure 1A).
Data on the main exposures of socioeconomic status, operationalized by income per
capita, and political preferences, operationalized by the 2016 county-level vote share for
President Trump, were obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS, 5-year averages
from 2014–2018) and MIT Election Data and Science Lab, respectively. Data on covariates
(percentage male, Black, and Hispanic residents; age distribution; share of adults with college
degrees; and shares of the workforce in industries most affected by COVID-19, i.e. retail,
transportation, and health, educational, or social services) were also obtained from the ACS.

We estimated associations between the degree of social distancing and socioeconomic
and political factors using cross-sectional ordinary least squares regressions, adjusting for
sociodemographic covariates, state fixed effects (to account for state-level differences in timing
and degree of COVID-19 mitigation measures), and rurality (from the 2010 Census).

Results
In bivariate analyses, lower per capita income and a higher share of voters supporting
President Trump were associated with reduced social distancing (Figures 1B, 1C). In
multivariable models adjusting for sociodemographic and labor market characteristics as well as
state fixed effects (Table 1), increasing per capita income from the bottom to top quartile (I.Q.R.
= $7,218) resulted in a 1.4 percentage point increase in social distancing (95% C.I. = 0.2–2.5).
An interquartile increase in support for Trump (I.Q.R. = 20.3%) resulted in a 4.1 percentage
point decrease in social distancing (95% C.I. = 3.0–5.2). Higher shares of racial minorities and
residents without college degrees were also associated with less distancing. There were no
significant associations by population share of gender or age.

Discussion
Lower socioeconomic status and greater Republican political orientation were
associated with reduced social distancing among U.S. counties. These results suggest that
income-related barriers (e.g. the need to continue working) and political beliefs may lead to
significant socioeconomic gradients in COVID-19, just as they do for other health conditions.4-5
Limitations of this study include the potential for omitted-variable and ecological biases due to
aggregate, cross-sectional data. Social distancing may also be measured with error, given that
the data do not sample all cell-phone users and do not reflect non-users.
Regardless, our findings underscore the heterogeneity of communities’ engagement in
public health responses to COVID-19. These patterns may help policymakers and health

resources and communications accordingly. Additional research as new data become available
is necessary to correlate these findings with infection rates and mortality.

Notes: Multivariable ordinary least squares regression for percentage-point change in average
county mobility, given an interquartile change in given characteristics. Negative values indicate
a greater degree of social distancing. The median county experienced a decrease in average
mobility of 27.3 percentage points during March 19–28. Based on 3,037 counties, using data
from Unacast, the American Community Survey, MIT Election Data and Science Lab, and
Census. Model includes state fixed effects and percentage for each decade of life; there were
no significant predictors among decades of life. 95% confidence intervals are provided.
