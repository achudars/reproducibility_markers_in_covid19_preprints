ABSTRACT
Background: During the first months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Mexico implemented
a national lockdown followed by post-lockdown mitigation.
Methods: We used daily number of SARS-CoV-2-confirmed hospitalizations (by date of
symptom onset) to assess the changes in the incidence of individuals between the age of 1059 years during the epidemic in Mexico. For each age group g, we computed the proportion
E(g) of individuals in that age group among all cases aged 10-59y during the early
lockdown period (April 20–May 3, 2020), and the corresponding proportion L(g) during
the late lockdown period (May 18-31, 2020) and post-lockdown mitigation (June 15-28,
2020). For each later period (late lockdown or post-lockdown), we computed the proportion
ratios relative to the early lockdown period PR(g)=L(g)/E(g). For each pair of age groups
g1,g2, PR(g1)> PR(g2) is interpreted as a relative increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections in
the age group g1 compared to g2 for the late lockdown and post-lockdown periods vs. the
early lockdown period.
Results: For the late lockdown period, the highest PR estimates belong to persons aged 1519y (PR=1.69(95%CI(1.05, 2.72))) and 20-24y (PR=1.43(1.10,1.86)). For the postlockdown period, the highest PR estimates were also in age groups 15-19y (PR=2.05(1.30,
3.24)) and 20-24y (PR=1.49(1.15,1.93)). These estimates were higher in persons 15-24y
compared to those ≥30y.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that adolescents and younger adults had an increased
relative incidence during late lockdown and the post-lockdown mitigation periods. The role
of these age groups during the epidemic should be considered when implementing future
pandemic response efforts.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Mexico is growing, with 1,070,487 cases and 103,597
deaths recorded by November 25th, 2020 [1]. In Mexico, on March 23rd (and until May 30th)
a call for a nationwide lock-down was made [2,3]. On June 1st, Mexico implemented postlockdown mitigation strategies that depending on community transmission and hospital
capacity, eased some of the initial restrictions [4]. To understand the transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 under different mitigation strategies, it is important to study the role that
different age groups have played on propagating the spread of the virus. Variations in
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age may take place during the course of an epidemic due
to changing mixing patterns [5], which in turn has implications for epidemic control.
Evidence has accumulated that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection increases
with age [6, 7]. Yet, this does not suggest that the oldest groups in a population necessarily
play the leading role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. Actually, several
serological studies suggest that adolescents and younger adults often experience the highest
cumulative rates of infection [8-15]. In England, the highest rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection
during the Fall of 2020 are in persons aged 18-24y and 13-17y (Figure 8 in [16]). Under the
physical distancing measures implemented in Mexico, mixing patterns for individuals in
different age groups may be quite different compared to regular mixing patterns [5,6]. Also,
similar to other low- and middle-income countries, a sizeable proportion of Mexico’s
population are relatively young informal workers who live from day to day for whom
shelter-in-place policies may represent a significant economic burden. It is unknown what
role do younger adults/older adolescents and other age groups play in propagating the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Mexico. To address this question, we estimate temporal changes
in SARS-CoV-2 incidence by age group during and after the national lockdown period. We
applied the methodology developed previously [17-19] to assess the temporal changes in
the incidence of different age groups of individuals between the age of 10-59 years during
the epidemic in Mexico.

Information on daily hospitalized COVID-19 cases by age group was obtained from the
Dirección General de Epidemiología in Mexico. We retrieved data on reported hospitalized
cases with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with available information on the date
of symptom onset on September 28, 2020. We excluded healthcare workers because of the
significant non-community transmission in that population group. We also excluded cases
from private hospitals because it is unclear how cases were ascertained and whether caseascertainment has changed over time. We also excluded non-hospitalized cases because
testing for non-severe COVID-19 may have changed over time for different age groups,
while the criteria for testing of cases requiring hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection
have been consistent over time.

Relative change in SARS-CoV-2 infection by age-group
We included laboratory confirmed hospitalizations in ten 5-year age groups: 10-14 years
through 55-59 years. Older adults were not included because of potential temporal changes
in ascertainment, as well as presence of some hospitalizations stemming from infections
that do not reflect community transmission (e.g., infections in long-term care facilities, with
rates of infection in those facilities being quite higher than in the corresponding age groups
in the community). We excluded children aged under 10 years for two reasons. First,
ascertainment of infection in those age groups might have changed with time as more
severe episodes in younger children appeared as the epidemic progressed. Second, there is
evidence of lower susceptibility to infection for children aged under 10 years compared to
adults and older adolescents [20], and those children are unlikely to play a significant role
in the progression of the epidemic.
We selected three periods: April 20 – May 3 (early lockdown period, we selected
this date because earlier numbers of cases in certain age groups were limited and may have
rendered our estimates unstable), 18-31 May (late lockdown period) and 15–25 June (postlockdown mitigation, starting two weeks after the national lockdown to detect changes in
symptom onset).
We applied a previously described procedure [17-19] to estimate the age-specific
proportion ratios for late lockdown (May 18-31, 2020) and post-lockdown mitigation (June
15-28, 2020) relative to the early lockdown (April 20–May 3, 2020) as follows: let E(g) be

that is, the ratio between the proportion of cases in age group g among all cases in the late

which is the OR for a hospitalized case with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to be in age
group g1 vs g2 for the early lockdown period and the late lockdown period. We repeated
these calculations for the comparison of early lockdown to post-lockdown. Estimates for
pairwise OR were performed using Fisher’s exact test.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the number of hospitalizations with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the
different age groups (10-14 through 55-59 years) for the early lockdown (April 20–May 3,
2020), the late lockdown (May 18-31, 2020) and the post-lockdown (June 15-28, 2020)
periods, as well as the corresponding estimates of the PR statistic (equations 1,2).
For the late lockdown period vs. the early lockdown, the highest PR (95% CI)
estimates belong to persons aged 15-19 years (PR=1.69(1.05, 2.72)) and 20-24 years
(PR=1.43(1.10,1.86)) (Table 1). The PR estimates in persons aged over 30 years were
significantly lower compared to persons aged 15-24 years. Table 2 gives the estimates of
ORs for different pairs of age groups (10-14y through 55-59y) for a hospitalized case with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection to be during the period May 18-31 vs. April 20-May 3
(equation 4). Our results suggest that for persons aged 15-24y, the corresponding OR
relative to any age group over 30y is above 1.
For the post-lockdown period vs. the early lockdown, the highest PR (95% CI)
estimates belong to persons aged 15-19 years (PR=2.05(1.30, 3.24)) and 20-24 years
(PR=1.49(1.15,1.93)) (Table 1). The PR estimates in persons aged over 30 years were
significantly lower compared to persons aged 15-24 years. Table 3 shows the estimates of
ORs during the post-lockdown period of June 15-28 vs. the lockdown period April 20-May
3. The corresponding OR for persons aged 15-24y relative to any age group over 30y is
significantly above 1 for the post-lockdown period compared to the early lockdown period.
This suggests a relative increase in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons aged
15-24y compared to persons aged 30-59y for the post-lockdown period relative to the early
lockdown period.

We applied the previously developed methodology [17-19] to study changes in the relative
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in different age groups during national lockdown and
post-lockdown mitigation in Mexico. Compared with early lockdown, the greatest relative
increase in the incidence of infection belongs to persons aged 15-24 years in both, the late
lockdown and post-lockdown mitigation. We note that in England, the highest rates of
SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Fall of 2020 are in persons aged 18-24y and 13-17y
(Figure 8 in [16]), which is consistent with our findings about the epidemiological
importance of older adolescents and younger adults during the epidemic.
We hypothesize there are two potential explanations for the increase in the
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adolescents and younger adults in Mexico: (i)
the need for young informal workers to return to work due to increasing economic burden
of physical distancing measures; (ii) fatigue related to adherence to the physical distancing
measures, resulting in progressively lesser adherence. Other explanations, such as changing
social responsibilities and increased use of public transportation may also apply, and further
work is needed to understand those issues to better inform future mitigation efforts. A
serological evaluation is underway which may confirm our observations.
Our results are consistent with observations in Germany, where using the same
methodology, a higher relative incidence of infection in older adolescents and younger
adults following the introduction of physical distancing measures was found [17]. In Spain,
using the same methodology as in [17], it was shown that during the initial lockdown
period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40-64 years had a higher
relative incidence of infection compared with the pre-lockdown period. However, during
the later strengthened lockdown, older adolescents and younger adults had an increased
relative incidence in SARS-CoV-2 infection [22]. Our results, together with these
observations, highlight the fact that control measures during a pandemic have differential
effectiveness in different age groups.
An important strength of our manuscript was the use of limited data obtained mostly
from detected cases to examine the role of different population groups in propagating the
spread of infection. However, our study is not without limitations. Our findings could be
affected by age-differential changes in case ascertainment, over time or across regions.
However, we restricted the analysis to hospitalized cases rather than all confirmed COVID7

19 cases in the community because changes in healthcare seeking behavior (e.g., for
ambulatory visits), and changes in testing in the outpatient setting might affect the relation
between the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the rates of detected COVID-19
cases. However, such temporal changes are less likely for hospitalized cases, with uniform
guidelines for testing hospitalized cases applied in Mexico, and low likelihood of mild
cases resulting in hospitalization during certain time periods. Second, the perception of the
potential severity of the disease may have changed over time and clinicians, even with an
existing case definition, may have preferentially tested certain age groups. We explored
whether testing for hospitalized patients in all age groups changed over time and did not
find evidence for this (Supplemental Figure). Third, we used date of symptom onset to
temporally classify cases from an administrative database. Thus the possibility of error in
registration is present. However, this error is probably random and unlikely to affect results.
Alternatively, there might be differences across age groups in their recall of the date of
onset, yet this seems unlikely. Fourth, it is important to notice that the database from the
Ministry of Health it is not updated over time. In other words, we do not know if a case that
was originally registered as an ambulatory case was later hospitalized.
In conclusion, our paper provides evidence for an increased relative incidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals aged 15-24 years when the lockdown
interventions were lifted. Our results suggest that the age structure was an important factor
in the effect of lockdown interventions. Multigenerational household arrangements are
common in Mexico. Therefore, efforts aimed at spreading risk awareness in adolescents
and young adults and limiting social interactions for members of certain age groups in
certain venues may be considered to stem the increase of COVID-19 incidence in the
community in Mexico.
