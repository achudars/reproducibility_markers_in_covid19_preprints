Abstract:
Since its origin in December 2019, Novel Coronavirus or COVID-19 has caused
massive panic in the word by infecting millions of people with a varying fatality rate. The main
objective of Governments worldwide is to control the extent of the outbreak until a vaccine or
cure has been devised. Machine learning has been an efficient mechanism to train, map,
analyze, and predict datasets. This paper aims to utilize regression, a supervised machine
learning algorithm to assess time-series datasets of COVID-19 pandemic by performing
comparative analysis on datasets of India and two Municipal Corporations of Maharashtra,
namely, Mira-Bhayander and Akola. Current study is an attempt towards drawing attention to
the dynamics and nature of the pandemic in a controlled locality such as Municipal
Corporation; which differs from the exponential nature observed nationally. However, for
limited area like the one considered the nature of curve is observed to be cubic for total cases
and multi-peak Gaussian for active cases. In conclusion, Government should empower district/
corporations/local authorities to adopt their own methodology and decision-making policy to
contain the pandemic at regional-level like the case study discussed herein.

Keywords: COVID-19, Pandemic, Statistical approach, Regression analysis.

1. Introduction:
China Country office informed the WHO of unknown cases of pneumonia on 30th
December 2019. On investigation, the officers found a link to the Huanan Seafood market of
Wuhan. Out of 44 cases, 33 patients were stable, but 11 were severely ill (WHO, 2020) [1].
Since its discovery, approximately 216 countries have been affected by it, with the total number
of
confirmed cases being 11.4 Million and 534K deaths. India currently has 697K cases and

19693 deaths, placing it at the third-highest position in the world as of 6 July (WHO, 2020)
[2].
Coronavirus showed similar etiology to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) virus of 2006. Hence, it is also known as SARS-2 or COVID-19 (WHO, 2020) [3]. It
is a contagious disease that spreads via minute respiratory droplets through coughing, sneezing,
or close contact. Patients can experience the symptoms in 2 to 14 days of incubation, such as
high fever, body pain or weakness, dry cough, breathlessness, pneumonia, kidney failure, and
respiratory distress. In some cases, the patients do not show any symptoms of the virus; that is,
they are asymptomatic. In both scenarios, testing of the patient is essential for verification, and
they should be isolated (He et al., 2020; Singhal et al., 2020) [4] [5]. Thus to curb the rate of
infection and prevent community spread wearing masks, to avoid crowded spaces and
maintaining the protocols of social distancing is essential (WHO, 2020) [3].
In India, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was of a man with travel history from
Wuhan (WHO, 2020) [3]. Although the progression of cases was slow initially, the Indian
government imposed a lockdown on 25th March to prevent human-to-human transmission and
contain the pace of the virus. After all the protective measures, the growth of the virus has
continued at an exponential rate in the country Figure 1. Thus, modeling the current situation,
analyzing the expansion pattern, identifying the reason for such behavior, and using it to
forecast the next trend of the virus will help us develop coping mechanisms.
In Section 1, the current scenario has been explained along with the background and
requirement of the proposed methodology. Section 2 details the importance of regression and
the theory behind it. Details and motivation regarding the case study have been explained in
Section 3. Section 4 consists of graphs and results after analysis. Section 5 details the
comparative discussions of the obtained results followed by the conclusion in Section 6.

2. Literature review:
Machine learning algorithms are used in all wakes of life, including the business sector,
finance, medical, engineering, and educational domains. It is exceptionally efficient in the
prediction of healthcare data (Mai et al., 2017, 2; Purcaro et al., 2018, 3; Ye et al., 2003) [6]
[7] [8]. Right from helping understand the influenza pandemic dynamics to analyze data for
prediction of the growth rate of COVID-19, its role is unmatched. As the cases of COVID-19
continue to at frightening rate, panic continues to spread among the people and their
government. Ceased production, reduction in goods and services, and a collapsing economy
and an increase in fatalities, create a situation of mass hysteria. In such scenarios, it can help
countries make the right decisions and avoid loss of human lives and economy. Designing an

accurate outbreak model will provide essential insights into new policy-making and will also
help evaluate the result of the policies (Remuzzi et al., 2020) [9].
Several mathematical and statistical models have been utilized by researchers to study
the behavior of the virus, people's response, and predictions. Ramjeet, 2020 in his paper used
six regression-based analysis models, i.e. quadratic, cubic, third, fourth, fifth, sixth degrees,
and exponential polynomial on the dataset of India (Yadav, 2020) [10]. It provided a functional
analysis of data, and the prediction model was viable for only seven days from the analysis.
Employing Support Vector Regression method, Milind et al., 2020 carried out five different
analyses, namely predicting spread, analyzing growth rate and types of mitigation, predicting
recovery rate, the transmission of the virus, and correlation to weather conditions (Yadav et al.,
2020) [11]. An ARIMA model with Exponential Smoothing and Holt-Winters model was used
by Vikas et al., 2020 for regression analysis of India's COVID-19 growth (Sharma et al., 2020)
[12]. The model also underestimates the actual observations but can be updated to remove that
issue, as suggested in the paper. It also predicted slowing in cases in the coming days, and
proper guidelines and measures accompanied reduction in daily cases with it.
Building on the recent conceptualization of detecting connective communities in time
series and Konstantinos et al., 2020 developed a novel spline regression model to determine
knot using community detection in the complex network for Greece dataset (Demertzis et al.,
2020, 5) [13]. Owing to diversity, the difference in geography, a large population, the study
would not be directly beneficial in predicting growth rate for India. Poonam et al. used a linear
and polynomial regression models on the datasets of various states of India (Chauhan et al.,
2020) [14]. It highlighted a difference in national and state-level models, similar to the
methodology proposed in this study. Gaurav et al., 2020 and Fairoza et al., 2020 have both
performed analysis during the early onset of the corona (Gupta et al., 2020; BintiHamzah et
al., 2020) [15] [16]. Gaurav, 2020 employed an SEIR and regression model with the data
following a linear pattern. It also predicted that community spread would increase cases
exponentially, which can be verified with the current models.
On the other hand, Fairuza et al., 2020, performed real-time data query and visualization
using SEIR predictive modeling. Sina et al., 2020 did a comparative analysis of ML and soft
computing models for predictive analysis on datasets from Italy, China, Iran, USA, and
Germany (Ardabili et al., 2020) [17]. A comparison of various models revealed that MLP and
ANFIS showed the best results and can be employed for long term predictions.
As can be seen from above, various types of methods have been used for analysis.
However, it has been limited to a national approach with a limited study on state-level
differences. Barely any form of study on district-level assessment is undertaken. As a

difference in state and national level dynamics have been proved previously, this paper's aim
would be to explore Municipal-level differences, by mapping and evaluating, datasets of MiraBhayandar and Akola.

3. Regression scheme:
Regression is a category of machine learning statistics tool. It utilizes supervised ML
that employs an algorithm to understand the mapping of output data to input. Its objective is to
map the approximate function as accurately as possible and train datasets. Analyzing data,
identifying patterns and making corrections with human help or correction is possible with help
of machine learning. These tools and algorithms are used by regression for mapping and
prediction. Regressions models are employed to study the relationship between single or
multiple independent variable(s) (X) and dependent variable(Y) involving unknown
parameter(s) (β) (Sarstedt et al., 2014, 3) [18].
The reason for such an analysis is to find β that best fits the model. The benefit of
regression analysis is that it can compute the relative strength of independent variables effects.
Additional analysis can also predict the value of y for a given x in the sample size n. It includes
modeling and analysis of variables to determine the most fitting algorithm that can explain their
correlation.
Y ≈ f (X, β) or Y = f (X, β) + e……………………………………………………………………(1)
The term e represents error or residue. It is the distance between every observed value
and its corresponding predicted value. ŷ(y-hat) represents prediction made by the best
regression line. An assumption during this process is that e follows a normal distribution N (0,
2) (Rasmussen et al., 2006, 1) [19]. Therefore, e is calculated by:
e1 = y1 -ŷ1………………………………………………………………………………………………(2)
Calculating β uses the Least-Squares Linear regression method. It minimizes the value
of e for the best fit curve. Another important quantity is the coefficient of determination orR2
that demonstrates the accuracy with which the proposed model describes the change in the
dependent variable. It is represented by the formula:
R2 = SSR / SST………………………………………………………………………………………..(3)
Where SSR represents square of difference between the regression line and average
value’s sum (sum of the squares), and SST is the square of difference between each observation
and the average value’s sum (total sum of squares),
𝑆𝑆𝑅 = ∑(𝑦 ′ − 𝑦̅′ )2 𝑆𝑆𝑇 = ∑(𝑦 − 𝑦̅)2……………………………………………………………(4)
where Yi's are the observed values corresponding to each X, the estimated (predicted)
̅ , 𝑦̅ depicts the average of Yi , and n is the
value of the response variable is represented by𝑦’

total observations. The value of R2 always lies between 0 and 1. For R2 = 1, the model has
perfect determination and a value closer to 1 indicates a better model.
Fitting curves used for modeling are simple linear, multiple linear, polynomials of varying
orders such as quadratic, cubic, exponential, Gaussian, and logarithmic. The analysis
performed in this study employed cubic, exponential, and multi-peak Gaussian curves.
3.1 Cubic regression:
The best fit line in this represents a curve rather than a straight line. It is much more
flexible to incorporate data with complex relationships. It is useful when the plotted data first
curves one way then another. It is considered a special case of the multiple linear regression
models. The function that represents the graph is:
𝑦̂ = 𝑎𝑥 3 + 𝑏𝑥 2 + 𝑐𝑥 + 𝑑…………………………………………………………………………….(5)
The following system of equations helps to find the value of coefficients:
𝑎 ∑ 𝑥𝑖3 + 𝑏 ∑ 𝑥𝑖2 + 𝑐 ∑ 𝑥𝑖 + 𝑛𝑑 = ∑ 𝑦𝑖 , …………………………………………………………..(6)
𝑎 ∑ 𝑥𝑖4 + 𝑏 ∑ 𝑥𝑖3 + 𝑐 ∑ 𝑥𝑖2 + 𝑑 ∑ 𝑥𝑖 = ∑ 𝑥𝑖 𝑦𝑖 , …………………………………………………...(7)

𝑎 ∑ 𝑥𝑖6 + 𝑏 ∑ 𝑥𝑖5 + 𝑐 ∑ 𝑥𝑖4 + 𝑑 ∑ 𝑥𝑖3 = ∑ 𝑥𝑖3 𝑦𝑖 …………………………….……………………. (9)
For comparing the efficiency, the model considers the value of standard error of regression
(𝐴̅), correlation coefficient (R), and coefficient of determination (R2).
𝑅 = √1 −

∑(𝑦𝑖 −𝑦̅)2

This method explains the district models in the study. It represented the total cases, the total
number of deceased and total recoveries in the model.
3.2 Exponential regression:
It is one of the simplest types of non-linear regression. When the coefficients vary non-linearly,
this method gives the best fitting curve.
𝑦̂ = 𝑒 𝑎+𝑏𝑥 ………………………………………………………………………………………….. (11)
Coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ can be calculated with the help of:
𝑏=

𝑛 ∑ 𝑥𝑖 ln 𝑦𝑖 − ∑ 𝑥𝑖 . ∑ ln 𝑦𝑖

For the study, the country's statistics in terms of total cases, recoveries, and deaths follow an
exponential trend.
Similar to cubic regression, standard error of regression (𝐴̅), correlation coefficient (R),
and coefficient of determination (R2) help to understand the efficiency of the model used with
the help of the same formula. If the correlation coefficient is 0, there is no relation between X
and Y, for negative value they are inversely proportional, and they are strongly related for

correlation coefficient’s value as 1. Both methods follow a similar path while solving the
problem. It compares unknown data in a tabular format to empirical formulae and finds the
closest match. It utilizes the Least Square Method to obtain the best fit for which residual is
minimum.
3.3 Multi-peak fitting Gaussian:
This method is especially useful as it increases the fit by the mathematical algorithm
and numerical calculation to find Gaussian sub-peaks in the model. The sub-peaks are then
combined, which results in a waveform that consists of multiple peaks (Qing et al., 2013) [20].
When the existing methods are unfit to describe the data or while the process involves small
datasets, it can provide uncertain measures on predictions.
In this method of approach, first, a Gaussian process prior is assumed:
𝑓(𝑥) ~ 𝐺𝑃(𝑚(𝑥), 𝑘(𝑥, 𝑥′))…………………………………………………………………...……(13)
Here, k (x, x’) represents covariance function and m(x) is the mean function. A
functional form does not limit Gaussian process regression (GPR) (Rasmussen et al., 2006, 1)
[19]. Therefore, it calculates a probability distribution over all logical functions that can fit the
data. For general purpose m(x) is taken as 0, since GPR is flexible to model mean arbitrarily
well. One of the popular kernels used is a constant kernel composition with a radial basis
function kernel. It encodes the similarity of inputs in space that corresponds to the similarity
of outputs. It has two hyper-parameters, signal variance (σ²) length scale (l).

4. Methodology:
The epidemiological statistics of India was obtained from the official COVID-19
website of India (Coronavirus India) [21]. The Indian subcontinent lies in the South Asian
continent, with a population close to 1.380 billion. Maharashtra has been one of the most
affected states during the pandemic, with approximately 217K confirmed cases as of 8 July. A
regional level analysis and prediction of the outbreak would aid the officials in decisionmaking. The official websites of Mira-Bhayander and Akola corporations provided
information regarding Coronavirus instances in the area, respectively (Mira- Bhayander;
District Akola) [22] [23]. While Kerala's official website was referred for details concerning
the state figures for active cases and the number of people in quarantine from 30 January to 4
June (Kerala) [24]. Total cases, recovery, death, and active cases corresponding to 29 January
to 25 May were examined for the national-level analysis. It is used as a benchmark for
comparative analysis with other results and understanding. Akola's statistics between 7 April

and 5 June were computed, while those of Mira-Bhayander were between 27 March and 2 June.
It comprised total positive cases in the regions and total cases, death, recovery, and number of
cases daily.
SciDAVis (Scientific Data Analysis and Visualization), a cross-platform program for
graphical presentation of datasets and data analysis, was used during the study's analysis phase.
It supports linear, non-linear and multi-peak functions and has built-in operations for column/
row statistics, convolutions, and filtering operations allowing with a user-friendly interface.
Since the data needed non-linear analysis such as exponential, cubic and multi-peak Gaussian,
this software was utilized for analysis.

5. Result of Regression Analysis:
Results of analysis performed on SciDAVis using time series datasets of India, Kerala
and Municipal Corporations of Mira-Bhayander and Akola have been stated in the form of
graphical and tabulated format in this section. It forms the basis of the discussion done in
Section 6.
5.1 Country-wise Plot:
Fig. 1 shows a graph of total cases, recoveries, active cases and death for country wise
dataset in the time frame 29th to 25th March. All four dotted lines mark the observed data while
blue line represents the fit. It is an exponential fit obtained during regression analysis and can
be represented with the equation: Y = Y0 + A * exp(x/t).

A comparative discussion on the significance of these spikes has been performed in the
Section 5. Lockdown that was implemented earlier is a form of quarantine and since we had
the data for number of people in quarantine in Kerala, this statistics was considered to compare
with the case study of Mira-Bhayander and Akola. Figure 9 is the plot for active cases in Kerala
between 30th January and 4th June. Total people on quarantine on each date in the state are
mentioned in Figure 10.

Plot of total active cases and number of people in quarantine follow a 3-peak Gaussian
curve similar to regional active cases. Kerala was one the earliest state in India to be affected
by the pandemic; the whole state underwent quarantine implementation. The plots obtained
after analysis are also similar to regional curves rather than country plot. Hence, its results can
be easily compared with the controlled containment zones. Values of area, centre, width and

6. Inferences drawn and discussion:
6.1 Country and Region Cumulative Plots:
Comparison of Figure 1 of the cumulative country plot with the plots of Mira-Bhayander
and Akola from Figures 3 and 4 shows the difference in the curve obtained i.e. while the
country plot follows an exponential path, regional curve behaves in a cubic manner. It can be
attributed to the reason that the outbreak's statistics behave differently at a lower level than at
the nation-level.
When all such statistics are combined, the resultant curve should resemble an exponential
pattern. Thus, the dynamics of COVID-19 at a regional-level change drastically and should be
noted while implementing policies.
6.2 Daily Cases:
The daily onset of cases in the regions of Mira-Bhayandar and Akola from Figures 7
and 8 show four notable spikes in the bar plot outbreak. The dates of these spike, lockdown
and unlock dates for comparison have been mentioned in Table 5. Table 5 exhibits that the
spikes are either an immediate result of or due to the anticipation of lockdown/ unlock. This
feature can only be seen in a regional plot, unlike the nation plot. Thus, it can be taken as a
reference for future policies.

6.3 Active Case Plots:
Active cases plot in Figures 5 and 6 of Mira- Bhayandar and Akola, respectively, mimic
a Gaussian curve with 3-peaks. It can be attributed to the fact that when the number of cases in
a region increases, the number of people in quarantine increases proportionally. However, as

the number of cases starts to fall, the quarantine number also decreases. As a result, more
people get infected, giving rise to active cases.
A prime example of this feature is graphs of Kerala in Figures 9 and 10 depicting active
and quarantine cases that follow this hypothesis. The validation of this response can be found
by analyzing active and quarantine case plots of Kerala, which shows that both factors are codependent. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain high rates for quarantine, irrespective of the
number of active cases, to avoid further outbreaks. Only when the total active cases start to
dwindle quarantine regulations should be relaxed.
India had previously been making decisions at the national level. However, after the
commencement of lockdown four, a state-based approach was followed where each state
devised its policies and regulations. The state implemented zone based policies depending upon
the extent of contamination. While drafting the paper Maharashtra State Government
implemented another policy that empowers districts/ Municipal Corporation to take its
decisions, showing a shift in trend from macro-level to micro-level policy making approach. It
supports the proposed problem statement, and it can help them model their regional datasets
for analysis. It can also be utilized to forecast further developments in response to decisions.

6. Conclusion & recommendations:
In this paper, the nature of growth of COVID-19 total cases, deceased, recovered and actives
cases with regional datasets from two Municipal Corporation was analyzed and the trends
obtained are compared with the national one. Following conclusions are derived from the
current study:


From the analysis carried out different trends are obtained for the regional datasets than
the national which is an indicator of pandemics distinct feature at local or zonal level.



The trends for active cases plot is moreover driven by the policy matters such as
changes in quarantine regulations, mapping of different zones within the locality,
containment zones, implementation of lockdown etc.



Spikes in daily cases observed in the regional plot are an attribute of human psychology
combined with lockdown outcomes.



This study suggests that more districts and states in every country should be given the
authorization to make decisions regarding policies and lockdowns regulations
depending on the outbreak's nature in particular regions.



Rules of quarantine should be adhered to strictly until the total active cases do not fall
to a minimum value for a continuous period. It would also help reduce spikes in daily
cases observed around significant days.



It is a known fact that lockdown affect the nature of cumulated and active cases,
however, only lockdown cannot be the only solution considering other factors of
economy. Hence, it is recommended to further devise mechanisms locally to identify
and distinguish micro-containment and volatile zones (hot-spots) using which
administration can take curative actions on these zones identified.



The authors’ advice that after locating the micro-containment zones, divide the locality
into micro-containment zones and analyze and target local solutions.
