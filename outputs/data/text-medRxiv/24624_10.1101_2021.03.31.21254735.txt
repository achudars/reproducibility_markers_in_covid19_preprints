Abstract
Background: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score predicts probability of in-hospital mortality.

Many crisis standards of care use SOFA score to allocate medical resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Research Question: Are SOFA scores disproportionately elevated among Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic

patients hospitalized with COVID-19, compared to Non-Hispanic White patients?

Study Design and Methods: Retrospective cohort study conducted in Yale New Haven Health System, including

5 hospitals with total of 2681 beds. Study population drawn from consecutive patients aged ≥18 admitted with

th

COVID-19 from March 29

st

to August 1

, 2020. Patients excluded from the analysis if not their first admission

with COVID-19, if they did not have SOFA score recorded within 24 hours of admission, if race and ethnicity

data were not Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, or Hispanic, or if they had other missing data. The

primary outcomes was SOFA score, with peak score within 24 hours of admission dichotomized as <6 or ≥6.

Results: Of 2982 patients admitted with COVID-19, 2320 met inclusion criteria and were analyzed, of whom

1058 (45.6%) were Non-Hispanic White, 645 (27.8%) were Hispanic, and 617 (26.6%) were Non-Hispanic Black.

Median age was 65.0 and 1226 (52.8%) were female. In univariate logistic screen and in full multivariate

model, Non-Hispanic Black patients but not Hispanic patients had greater odds of an elevated SOFA score ≥6

when compared to Non-Hispanic White patients (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.11-1.99).

Interpretation: Crisis standards of care utilizing the SOFA score to allocate medical resources would be more

likely to deny these resources to Non-Hispanic Black patients.

Introduction
Prior to the first wave of Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19), models predicted that a pandemic respiratory

virus might require ventilators, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and other life-sustaining medical resources far in

th

excess of available supplies. (1) On January 30

2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public

Health Emergency of International Concern which, in some countries, led to formal and informal restrictions

on the allocation of critical medical resources on the basis of advanced age. (2, 3)

In response to early shortages and high rates of infection and mortality in Europe and the Northeastern

United States, a number of healthcare systems and states in the US developed crisis standards of care (CSC):

guidelines that advise hospitals and providers how to operate in a public health disaster, outside of their

normal operating standards of care. CSC include triage protocols for the allocation of scarce life-sustaining

medical resources. (4-8) The primary goal of published protocols is to establish a consistent system for

allocating resources to save as many lives as possible during public health emergencies.

Publicly available triage protocols, prior to and during the pandemic, focus primarily on the Sequential

Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score to assess patients’ likelihood of benefiting (surviving) as a result of

receiving medical resources. (9) The SOFA score is a validated prognostic score ranging from 0-24, with points

assigned for evidence of organ failure within 6 different organ systems, with higher scores correlating with a

higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality. (10, 11) Originally developed and validated among septic patients in

the medical ICU, the SOFA score has also been shown to predict mortality among patients with acute

respiratory distress syndrome in the setting of COVID-19 infection. (12) Most disaster triage protocols

prioritize patients who require medical resources but have lower SOFA scores to receive resources, on the

grounds that such patients are more likely to benefit (survive).

In addition to threatening to overwhelm existing medical resources, the COVID-19 pandemic has also

highlighted and exacerbated existing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health disparities. Marginalized

populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and individuals of lower socioeconomic status, are more

likely to become infected with COVID-19, more likely to be hospitalized, and more likely to die as a result. (13-

15) Disparities in social determinants of health, including safe access to adequate nutritious food, exercise

options, stable housing, and economic opportunities likely contribute to disparities in COVID-19 outcomes.

Marginalized populations are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that cannot be conducted

remotely, are more likely to depend on public transportation, and are more likely to live in small and densely

packed housing units and in group-living situations including homeless shelters, prisons, jails, and detention

facilities. (16-19) They are less likely to have access to preventive healthcare and more likely to experience

bias when they do access the healthcare system, resulting in higher rates of chronic comorbidities including

diabetes, hypertension, and chronic pulmonary diseases. (20, 21) These pervasive inequities constitute a

structure of systemic racism and contribute to higher rates of COVID-19 infection, more severe acute illness

due to preexisting conditions, and higher mortality rates. (22, 23)

Given that marginalized populations are more likely to become sicker with COVID-19, utilization of CSC

triage protocols, which rely on the SOFA score, have the potential to disproportionately deny medical

resources to racial and ethnic minorities. (24, 25) The potential for triage protocols to exacerbate racial and

ethnic health disparities has been documented in patient cohorts with sepsis and acute respiratory distress

syndrome (ARDS) but has not previously been examined in patients with COVID-19. (26) There is therefore a

lack of evidence as to whether there are disparities by race and ethnicity in SOFA scores amongst patients

admitted with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine whether SOFA scores are

disproportionately elevated among members of racial and ethnic minorities, and specifically Non-Hispanic

Black and Hispanic patients, in comparison to Non-Hispanic White patients with COVID-19. The existence of

such a disparity would raise significant concerns about the use of triage protocols relying on SOFA scores and

the potential for exacerbating racial and ethnic health inequities during future waves of the COVID-19

pandemic and other public health emergencies.

Methods
Study design and data source
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 within the Yale-New Haven

Health System (YNHH) from March 29th, 2020 to August 1, 2020. YNHH includes 5 hospitals and a large

physician practice base, serving racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse communities across

Connecticut and Rhode Island. The hospitals range from primary community hospitals to a tertiary academic

medical center, with a total of 2,681 beds. Data from the YNHH electronic medical record (EMR, Epic Systems

Corporation, Verona, WI) database was used for analyses. The study was approved by the Yale University

Human Subjects Committee (study number 2000028081).

Participants
We included EMR data for all patients age ≥18 with COVID-19 admitted to YNHH hospitals during the

study period. Patients were considered positive for COVID-19 if they had a positive PCR test or clinical markers

including fever, cough and chest radiographs considered to be consistent with COVID-19 infection in the

setting of the first wave of the pandemic in the northeastern United States, and designated as COVID-19

positive by an attending physician. Patients <18 years of age were excluded as the SOFA score is not validated

in pediatric patients. Patients were excluded from the analysis if they did not have a SOFA score recorded

within 24 hours of admission, if it was not their first admission with COVID-19, or if their race and ethnicity

data were not Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, or Hispanic (Fig 1). Because prior COVID-19 studies

show that Black and Hispanic patients experience higher rates of critical illness and mortality, (13-15) we

hypothesized that Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients will be more likely to have elevated SOFA scores

within 24 hours of admission compared to Non-Hispanic White patients.

Predictor variables
Data extracted from the EMR included sociodemographic and clinical variables. Our main predictor

variables were age, sex, race, ethnicity, and insurance status. These variables are recorded by admitting clerks

at YNHH hospitals. Other variables included clinical characteristics like body mass index (BMI) and comorbid

conditions known to be associated with mortality in the setting of COVID-19. (15) Smoking status was not

included in the analysis, because in our clinical experience there is a significant desirability bias, leading

patients to report themselves to clinicians as non-smokers or former smokers rather than current smokers.

(27)

Outcome variable
The main outcome, SOFA score, was continuously and automatically calculated for all admitted

patients and recorded every 4 hours within the YNHH EMR. SOFA score was determined by an automated

algorithm within the EMR system, assigning 0-4 points for each of 6 organ systems (neurologic, pulmonary,

cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, hematologic), based on laboratory, respiratory and nursing flowsheet data in

the EMR, following previously specified and validated rules.(10) The total SOFA score ranges from 0-24, with

higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality. A binary SOFA variable (peak score within

24 hours <6, ≥6) was created to examine variation in illness severity by patient sociodemographic

characteristics. We focused on this dichotomous outcome because published triage protocols categorize

patients with a SOFA score <6 as being in the most prioritized group, most likely to receive scarce medical

resources in a disaster situation, whereas patients with SOFA score ≥6 are deprioritized, resulting in lower

likelihoods of receiving scarce medical resources.(4, 8) We focused on peak SOFA score within the first 24

hours because in a public health emergency in which life-sustaining medical resources are fully occupied, it is

initial SOFA scores that will determine whether a newly admitted critically ill patient receives scarce resources.

Statistical analysis
We used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests to examine mean differences in peak 24-hour SOFA score

by sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Chi-square tests were used to examine differences in the

proportion of COVID positive patients with SOFA score ≥6 and <6 by patient characteristics. Finally, we

conducted logistic regression analyses to assess racial differences in SOFA score adjusting for

sociodemographic and clinical covariates. We considered candidate covariates based on clinical experience

and emerging evidence regarding associations with clinical outcomes in COVID-19. The final multivariate

model was then refined through the exclusion of collinear covariates. We conducted a univariate screen

followed by a multivariate regression adjusting for all sociodemographic and clinical covariates listed in Table

3. Race-stratified models were also constructed to assess whether factors associated with SOFA score varied

according to race and ethnicity.

YNHH hospitals. Of these, 2982 were first admissions (Fig. 1) and 2796 were Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic

White, or Hispanic. Of these, 88 had missing baseline demographics or clinical data, and 388 had missing SOFA

scores, and were excluded. Two thousand three hundred and twenty patients had complete race/ethnicity

included in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical

characteristics between patients with and without SOFA scores.

Within the study cohort of 2320, 1058 (45.6%) were Non-Hispanic White, 645 (27.8%) were Hispanic,

and 617 (26.6%) were Non-Hispanic Black (Table 1). The median age was 65.0, and 1226 (52.8%) were female.

Six-hundred and fifty-nine (28.4%) had Medicaid or no insurance. Nine-hundred and sixty-nine (41.7%) were

obese. A total of 1829 (78.8%) had one or more comorbid conditions thought to increase risk of mortality in

the setting of COVID-19. Patients with peak SOFA scores ≥6 within the first 24 hours were disproportionately

common among Non-Hispanic Black patients, older patients, males, and patients with Congestive Heart Failure

(CHF), diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, advanced renal disease, and advanced liver

disease. Baseline characteristics broken down by race/ethnicity are available (S1 Table).

In a univariate logistic screen and in a full multivariate model (Table 3), Non-Hispanic Black patients

had greater odds of an elevated SOFA score ≥6 when compared to Non-Hispanic White patients (OR 1.49,

95%CI 1.11-1.99). In contrast, Hispanic patients did not have increased odds of an elevated SOFA score.

Advanced age was also associated with increased odds of elevated SOFA score (OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.07-3.54 for

age 35-64, OR 2.57, 95%CI 1.32-4.98 for age ≥65), as was male sex (OR 1.94, 95%CI 1.51-2.50), body-mass

Discussion
In our cohort of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to YNHH hospitals, Non-Hispanic Black

race/ethnicity, male sex, advanced age, stage II or greater obesity, advanced renal disease, and advanced liver

disease were all independently associated with significantly higher odds of elevated peak SOFA score ≥6

during the first 24-hours of admission. Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with increased risk of elevated

SOFA score. Medicaid and Medicare insurance types were not independently associated with increased odds

of elevated SOFA score.

These findings are consistent with prior studies showing that Black race, older age, obesity, and chronic

medical comorbidities are associated with increased rates of mortality in COVID-19. (15) These findings are

also consistent with prior findings that SOFA overestimates mortality among Black patients and

underestimates mortality among White patients with sepsis and ARDS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. (26)

The racial disparities in SOFA scores we found among patients with COVID might be due to this systemic

overestimation of mortality among Black persons and underestimation of mortality among White persons.

Alternatively, Black persons with COVID-19 might have higher SOFA scores in the hospital because COVID-19

affects them more severely, for example because they are subjected to higher levels of discrimination and

stress or because they have less access to long-term preventive care. (20, 21, 28) Finally, Black patients might

have higher SOFA scores at the time of admission because they present or are admitted to hospitals only

when they are sicker. (29, 30) This could be because of current or prior discrimination within the healthcare

system that might discourage patients from seeking medical attention with mild or moderate symptoms. (31)

Our data does not directly explain the cause of elevated SOFA scores among Black patients with COVID-19.

It is notable that patients with Medicaid or no insurance did not have elevated SOFA scores in

comparison to patients with private insurance. This might suggest that insurance status plays a relatively

limited role in elevated SOFA scores during the first 24 hours of hospital admission. If so, other factors, such as

housing density, public transportation utilization, employment in the service sector, telecommuting

opportunities, racial discrimination, or distrust of the healthcare system, might account for elevated SOFA

scores among Non-Hispanic Black patients.

Because published triage protocols utilize the SOFA score to allocate scarce medical resources, and

prioritize patients with SOFA score <6 over other patients, such protocols – if implemented – would be more

likely to triage Non-Hispanic Black people to not receive scarce resources such as ventilators and ICU beds

during future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a system that predictably leads to racial disparities

in health outcomes, triage protocols have the potential to become a component of systemic racism.

Given these findings and the possibility that crisis standards of care may be implemented during the

COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to prospectively consider and implement measures to reduce systemic

racism, protect marginalized populations, and promote racial and ethnic equity. The ideal would be to

minimize or prevent entirely the need for triage, particularly among marginalized populations. This might be

achieved in the short term through public health education, distribution of personal protective equipment,

stockpiling of critical medical resources, targeted COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, social distancing, and even

lockdowns coupled with financial support. The manifest injustice of the systemic racism and health inequities

that COVID-19 has highlighted should also motivate long-term efforts to achieve more equitable health

outcomes in the United States. These might include universal health insurance, a more redistributive system

of taxation, housing support, elimination of food deserts and neighborhood segregation, anti-racism trainings

for clinicians, and recruitment of marginalized populations into the medical workforce.

It is also possible to make crisis standards of care and triage protocols themselves more equitable. The

development, revision, and oversight of these protocols might be made more open and transparent to

patients, community members, and to the general public. Healthcare systems and states might recruit triage

advisory and oversight committees that specifically include robust representation from ethnic and racial

minorities, as well as individuals with disabilities and other marginalized populations. (8) Committees might

specifically recruit advocacy organizations, faith leaders, institutional diversity officers, and other community

leaders to ensure adequate representation of community concerns. The triage teams that implement

protocols in hospitals might also be mandated to include representation of diverse perspectives.

In addition, the SOFA score might be supplemented to achieve more equitable outcomes. Prioritarian

triage protocols might still use mortality probability scoring, such as the SOFA score, but might give

marginalized populations a bonus or prioritization in these assessments. For example, patients might have

their priority score improved slightly on the basis of their home address, using the Area Deprivation Index. (32)

Potential comparative advantages and disadvantages of alternative triage systems are reviewed elsewhere.

(33)

Our study is limited in that it was conducted within a single healthcare system in the Northeastern

United States. Our healthcare system experienced a surge of COVID patients relatively early in the pandemic,

with a peak on April 22, 2020 followed by relatively lower numbers, and medical care for COVID-19 has

evolved over the course of the pandemic. While YNHH serves significant Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black

patient populations, it serves relatively smaller numbers of Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, and other

patient populations, and these small samples statistically forbade inclusion in the analysis. The disparities that

this study documents may not be generalizable to other regions with different racial and ethnic demographics

within the United States or globally. Our study is also limited by the data available within the clinical EMR. For

example, racial and ethnic data is generally documented by unit clerks based on their observation of patients

rather than on patient’s self-identification. Prior studies have shown that “socially assigned” race does

associate closely with health outcomes. (34) Another limitation is that we did not investigate potential

disparities in SOFA scores in other marginalized populations. Future research is needed to examine the effects

of disability, psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorders, unstable housing, or incarceration on SOFA

scores.

In conclusion, Non-Hispanic Black patients admitted to hospitals with COVID-19 had increased odds of

an elevated SOFA score ≥6 within the first 24-hours of admission. Therefore, published triage protocols

utilizing the SOFA score to allocate scarce medical resources would be more likely to deny Non-Hispanic Black

patients scarce medical resources such as ventilators and ICU beds if implemented during the COVID-19

pandemic. Governments and healthcare systems should prospectively consider and implement measures to

reduce systemic racism, protect marginalized populations, and promote racial and ethnic equity the pandemic.
