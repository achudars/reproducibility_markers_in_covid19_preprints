Abstract
Importance: Nursing home (NH) residents are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2
infections and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lethality. However, excess deaths in this
population have rarely been documented.
Objectives: The primary objective was to assess the number of excess deaths among NH
residents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The secondary
objectives were to determine the number of excess deaths as a proportion of the total
excess deaths in the general population and determine whether a harvesting effect was
present.
Design: We studied a cohort of 494,753 adults (as of March 1st, 2020) aged 60 and over in
6,515 NHs in mainland France. This cohort was exposed to the first wave of the COVID-19
pandemic (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020) and was compared with the corresponding,
reference cohorts from 2014 to 2019 (using data from the French National Health Data
System).
Main outcome and measures: The main outcome was all-cause death. Weekly excess deaths
and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated.
Result: There were 13,505 excess deaths among NH residents. Mortality increased by 43%
(SMR: 1.43). The mortality excess was higher among males than among females (SMR: 1.51
and 1.38, respectively) and decreased with age (SMRs in females: 1.61 in the 60-74 age
group, 1.58 for 75-84, 1.41 for 85-94, and 1.31 for 95 or over; Males: SMRs: 1.59 for 60-74,
1.69 for 75-84, 1.47 for 85-94, and 1.41 for 95 or over). We did not observe a harvesting
effect (up until August 30th, 2020). By extrapolating to all NH residents nationally
(N=570,003), the latter accounted for 51% of the total excess deaths in the general
population (N=15,114 out of 29,563).
Conclusion: NH residents accounted for about half of the total excess deaths in France during the
first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The excess death rate was higher among males than
females and among younger residents than among older residents. We did not observe a
harvesting effect. A real-time mortality surveillance system and the identification of individual
and environmental risk factors might help to design the future model of care for older dependent
adults.

ntroduction
In high-income countries, almost all deaths cause by coronavirus disease 2019

(COVID-19) have occurred in older adults. In the United States, 80% of the deaths occurred
among people aged 65 or over. 1,2 In France, 71% of the in-hospital deaths between March
1st and June 2nd, 2020, concerned patients aged 75 or over.1 In China, the case fatality rate
was 2% overall, 8% in patients aged 70 to 79, and 15% in patients aged 80 and over.3 In a
meta-analysis of 58 studies covering 122,191 hospitalized patients worldwide, COVID-19
lethality was more strongly associated with age over 65 than with comorbidities, obesity,
hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer.4,5
Soon after the start of the pandemic, there were concerns about nursing homes
(NHs) as hotspots of contagion and deaths.6 Several European governments were criticized
for reporting only in-hospital deaths because it soon became clear that deaths in NHs
accounted for a nonnegligible proportion of deaths - between 25% and 66% in the United
States and in European countries. 7-9 Accordingly, the surveillance systems built to count
daily COVID-19 deaths started to distinguish between hospitals, NHs, and private homes. 10,11
However, these systems give a fragmented view of the overall impact of the pandemic on
NH residents, since some of the latter died in their NH and others died in hospital.
Hence, reporting COVID-19-related deaths alone gives a partial view of the pandemic’s
impact. In contrast, the estimation of excess deaths takes account of the pandemic’s
negative (mortality-increasing) and positive (mortality-decreasing) direct and indirect
effects.12,13
We hypothesized that the overall impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on NH
residents in France could be assessed by leveraging the national NH administrative database
(RESID-EHPAD, part of the French National Health Data System).14 The primary objective of
the present study was to assess the magnitude of excess mortality among NH residents in
France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overall and by age, sex and territorial
unit. The secondary objectives were to (i) determine excess deaths in NHs as a proportion of
total excess deaths, (ii) assess changes over time of excess mortality, and determine whether
a harvesting effect (i.e., a short-term forward shift in mortality15,16) was present.

Methods
Design
This was a nationwide cohort study of NH residents exposed (the 2020 cohort) or not (the
2014-2019 cohorts) to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The six-year
reference period was used to smooth out annual variations in mortality.12,15

Setting
Residential homes for dependent older adults requiring nursing and medical care
(“établissements d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes”) located throughout
mainland France (the COVID-19 pandemic occurred later in France’s overseas territories).

Participants
The study cohorts were composed of adults aged 60 or over residing in an NH on March 1st
of each year. Residents admitted to an NH between March 1st and December 31st were not
included.

Follow-up
Two analysis periods were defined. The first period (from March 1st to May 31st, 2020)
covered the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and was compared with the
same period in the previous 6 years (2014-2019). The second period ran from December
30th, 2019, to August 30th, 2020. Each week in this period was compared with the same week
in the previous 6 years.17

Data sources
RESID-EHPAD is a French national online database in which all admissions and discharges of
NH residents are reported. NHs funded and managed by the French national health
insurance fund for agricultural workers (Mutualité Sociale Agricole) do not contribute to
RESID-EHPAD. Although the RESID-EHPAD database is part of the French National Health
Data System (Système National des Données de Santé, SNDS), it cannot be accessed routinely
by researchers. 14,18 The SNDS contains extensive individual data on all expenditure covered
by France’s mandatory public health insurance system, together with the dates of deaths

provided by the French National Statistics Office (Institut National de la Statistique et des
Etudes Economiques, INSEE) through local health insurance offices. The standard,

anonymized SNDS data extracts made available to authorized researchers do not contain the
RESID-EHPAD variables. Analyses of French National Health Data System were performed
with the permission of the independent French data protection authority (Commission
Nationale Informatique et Libertes) and by decree (articles R. 1461&#8208;12 and seq. of
the French Public Health Code).

Outcome

The main outcome was death, regardless of where it reportedly occurred.

Variables
We analyzed sex, age, and the NH’s geographic location. Four age groups were pre-specified:
60-74, 75-84, 85-94, and 95 or over. Geographic locations were classified according to the
third level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 3), corresponding to
the département (of which there are 96 in mainland France).19

Statistical analysis
The baseline characteristics of the NHs and their residents were described as the frequency
(percentage) or the mean (standard deviation (SD)). Two indicators were used to summarize
observed mortality, the total number of deaths, and the cumulative mortality rates over the
whole period and on a weekly basis. For calculation of the mortality rates, the observation
time per person present at the beginning of period (i.e., present on March 1st or at the
beginning of a specific week) was calculated up to the date of death if this event occurred till
the end of the period.
Firstly, expected numbers of deaths were estimated as counterfactual values by applying the
5-year age group- and sex-specific mortality rates observed for the 2014-2019 cohorts to the
2020 cohort. Secondly, numbers of excess deaths were calculated as observed deaths minus
expected deaths for the first-wave period and per week. Thirdly, standardized mortality
ratios (SMRs) were obtained by computing the ratio between observed and expected
deaths.17 Excess mortality patterns were studied according to age, sex and geographical
(NUTS3) location. Lastly, to estimate the excess death among the whole NH population, the
SMR was applied to missing NH residents from the same NUTS3 unit. Data on the numbers

of missing NH residents were obtained from the French national registry of healthcare and
social establishments (Fichier national des établissements sanitaires et sociaux, FINESS) as of
March 29th, 2020. We then computed excess deaths among NH residents as a proportion of
those in the whole population (according to data from INSEE) for 2020 vs. 2014-2019. 20
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS Enterprise Guide software (version 4.3, SAS
Institute Inc. Cary, NC). Results were reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting
of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.

Results
Baseline characteristics
The 2020 cohort included 494,753 residents from 6515 NHs in mainland France. The baseline
characteristics of the residents and NHs are summarized in Table 1. 74% of the residents
were female. The mean (SD) age was 89 (8) years for females and 84 (9) years for males. The
mean number of residents per NH was 83 (43).

Mortality rates and excess deaths
A total of 44,666 NH residents died between March 1st and May 31st, 2020, versus an
average of 30,647 in the reference cohorts. The cumulative mortality rate in NHs during the
first wave was 9.5%, versus 6.4% during the same period in the previous 6 years. In all age
groups, the mortality rate was higher in males than in females (Table 2). The mortality rate
increased with age (Table 2). There were 13,505 excess deaths among NH residents, giving
an SMR of 1.43; hence, mortality increased by 43% in 2020, relative to the previous 6 years.
Overall, there were 570,003 NH residents in France on March, 2020. Applying the SMR for
NH residents in the same NUTS3 to the missing residents, we estimated that there were
15,114 excess deaths among the entire population of NH residents. There were 29,563
excess deaths in the general population in 2020, relative to 2014-2019. Therefore, NH
residents may have accounted for 51% of the excess deaths in the France’s population.

Changes over time in the death rate
The observed number of deaths per week exceeded the expected number of deaths from
week 11 to week 26, with a peak in weeks 14 (5,486 deaths) and 15 (5,474 deaths) (Figure
1.A). The weekly mortality rate reached 1.16% during week 15. More than 3,000 excess
deaths per week were observed in weeks 14 and 15 (SMR: 2.37) (Figure 1 C,D). We did not
observe a lack of deaths (i.e., a harvesting effect) at any time during the study period (ending
in week 35, August 2020; Figure 1).

Age- and sex-specific mortality rates and excess deaths

The changes over time were similar in the four age groups and in both sexes (Figure 3). The
excess mortality rate was higher among males than among females (Table 2) and decreased
with age in females (Table 2 and Figure 2). In males, the SMR was higher in the 75-84 age
group than in the 60-74 age group and then decreased again for older age groups (Table 2
and Figure 3).

Geographic distribution of mortality rates and excess deaths
At the NUTS3 level, the mortality rate among NH residents during the first wave of the
pandemic ranged from 5.3% in Lozère (a rural département with the lowest population
density) to 22.2% in the socially deprived Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis. Accordingly, the
SMR ranged from 0.92 in Lozère to 3.47 in Seine-Saint-Denis (Figure 4).

Discussion
Among 494,753 residents of 6,515 NHs in mainland France, we observed 13,505 excess
deaths during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1st to May 31st, 2020), relative
to the previous 6 years. The mortality increased by 43%. The excess mortality was higher in
males than in females (51% and 38%, respectively) and decreased with age. The changes over
time in excess mortality were similar in all age groups and in both sexes. At the peak of the
first wave (weeks 14 and 15), there were more than 3,000 excess deaths (giving SMRs of
2.26 and 2.37, respectively). The excess mortality varied greatly from one territorial unit to
another (from -8% to +247%). We did not observe a harvesting effect at any time during the
study period, which ending in week 35, August 30th, 2020 (i.e., 3 months after the end of the
first wave). The NH residents accounted for 51% of the excess mortality in the general
population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to have assessed the overall
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on deaths of NH residents. As mentioned above, reporting
at the start of the health crisis typically included in-hospital deaths but not deaths in NHs,
and only the place of death (rather than the place of residence at the time of death) was
taken into account.10,11 In England & Wales, the United Kingdom’s Office for National
Statistics reported 57,074 excess deaths between March and May 2020, of which 26,211
(46%) occurred in care homes.10,11 In France, the INSEE estimated that the number of deaths
in NHs increased by 54% between March and April 2020, compared with the previous year.
However, these figures did not take account of NH residents who died after being
transferred to a hospital. Moreover, there was a degree of uncertainty regarding the
reporting on the place of death by municipal offices of vital records.10
The majority of studies in the literature reported on COVID-19-related deaths rather than
excess deaths. In France and in England & Wales, respectively 10,264 and 9,039 COVID-19related deaths in NHs were reported between March and May 2020. Furthermore, 3,615 and
3,444 in-hospital COVID-19-related deaths of NH residents were respectively reported. 1,11 A

lack of PCR tests at the beginning of the pandemic, atypical clinical presentations in older
people, reports of both suspected and confirmed cases to the health surveillance system,
and (in France) erroneous reporting of the place of death by municipal offices of vital records
all led to uncertainty regarding deaths attributed to COVID-19 in NHs.21,22
The steep increase and then decrease in excess deaths during the first wave were similar to
those observed in 65 NHs in New York City.23 In France, however, the decrease in excess
deaths began 4 weeks after visits with NH residents were prohibited (week 11) and became
much more pronounced 3 weeks after the start of the nationwide period of lockdown (week
12). The mortality rate among NH residents in New York City decreased 5 weeks after visits
were prohibited.23
We also found an inverse relationship between the relative magnitude of excess deaths and
increasing age in females. In males, the relative excess death rate was consistently lower in
older age groups than in younger age groups but the relationship was not linear: the relative
number of excess deaths was higher in the 75-84 age group than in the 60-74 age group.
Similar results have been observed in the general population. 22 In Italy, for instance, Conti
and colleagues found a lower excess mortality in nonagenarians than in their younger
counterparts.24 This might have been due to a healthy survivor effect. Younger NH residents
might have more comorbidities - notably stroke and diabetes, which are risk factors for
COVID-19 severity and lethality - than older residents. 5,24-26 Interestingly, a multicenter
retrospective cohort study of 821 older COVID-19 patients (average age of 86 years)
hospitalized in acute geriatric ward did not evidence an age-group-related difference in
mortality after adjustment for comorbidities and dependency.27 The excess mortality was
higher among males than among females; this is in line with the well-known excess mortality
among males in other settings 25. This sex difference might also be due to the clinical profile
of males in NHs, who are younger but have more cardiometabolic risk factors than females
in NHs. 18
An acute health crisis can produce a harvesting effect as was suggested during the 2016
influenza A epidemics. 16 We did not observe a harvesting effect during the study period
(ending in August 2020, i.e., three months after the end of the first wave). A similar
observation was made in France after the August 2003 heatwave; 15,000 excess deaths
were not followed by a lack of deaths until the following year.28 This finding may indicate
that the deaths observed during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had not affected only

those whose health was already so compromised that they "would have died in the short
term anyway" but also compromised the health of the survivors. Another explanation might
be the persistence of COVID-19 until August - the very beginning of the second wave. Lastly,
COVID-19 survivors from the first wave may have been weakened and may have died
afterwards.
In line with previous studies, we observed marked spatial heterogeneity in excess deaths
among NH residents. 29,23 This heterogeneity might be due to differences in the regional
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infections (notably in north-east France), urban density, and
other environmental factors. 23,30,31
Moreover, the pandemic and the corresponding public health responses had both positive
and negative direct and indirect effects on the general population by increasing social
isolation, reducing the frequency of road traffic accidents and occupational injuries, and
restricting access to care for health conditions other than COVID-19. 12,13,24,32-34 Similarly, the
pandemic and the corresponding public health responses might have had both direct and
indirect effects on NHs. Although it is hard to imagine that COVID-19 had positive effects in
NHs, this topic has not been studied and the part of direct and indirect effects of pandemic
on excess mortality remains unknown. Our results suggest that COVID-19 had a large, direct,
negative impact on excess mortality in NHs. The number of excess death estimated here
(15,000) was slightly higher than the nationally reported number of COVID-19-related deaths
among NH residents (14000). 1 The changes over time in excess deaths and the
concentration of these deaths in the territorial units most strongly affected by SARS-CoV-2
also argue in favor of a direct effect. However, the presence of excess deaths in some
territories barely or not impacted by the first wave of COVID-19 infection argues in favor of
the presence of both direct and indirect effects. Moreover, a proportion of the deaths
attributed to COVID-19 by the French national surveillance system might have another cause
because both suspected and confirmed cases were recorded at the start of the pandemic.1
The present study had several strengths. Firstly, the nationwide setting enabled us to
extrapolate our results to the entire population of NH residents. Secondly, access to
reference data from the previous 6 years in the same population enabled us to smooth out
year-on-year variations in mortality. However, given that the impact of influenza epidemics
on NH mortality varies widely from one year to the next, it would be interesting to compare

2020’s excess deaths with each single reference year as a function of the influenza epidemic
at that time.
Conclusion
We estimated that during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, 15,114 excess deaths
occurred among NH residents in France. These deaths accounted for 51% of the total excess
deaths in the general population. The mortality increased overall by 43%. The excess mortality
was higher among males than among females (51% and 38%, respectively) and decreased with
age. Excess deaths varied widely across from one territorial unit to another. We did not
observe a harvesting effect during the study (up until August 30th, 2020).
Real-time mortality surveillance in both NHs and hospitals is critically important for monitoring
epidemics and other health crises and for guiding public health decisions.35 The analysis of causes
of death (when available) should help to differentiate between deaths directly vs. indirectly
caused by COVID-19. A refined analysis is required to identify individual and environmental risk
factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 lethality. In particular, the roles of
comorbidities, old age, dependency, the resident:staff ratio, the use of personal protective
equipment, NH crowding, population density, and other socio-economic factors must be
characterized before models of care and nursing for dependent older adults are designed.36
