Abstract

Background
The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China in early December 2019 has
caused widespread transmission within the country, with over 1,000 deaths reported to date. Other
countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with
some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We
aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside
mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the
relative potential of case importation between countries outside China.
Methods
We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an
uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location
outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a
branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and
recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the betweencountry connectivity.
Results
We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected
COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a
local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction
index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to
each recipient country.
Conclusions
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is
important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries
outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.

Introduction
The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan City, China at the end of 2019, has
caused large numbers of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and deaths in Wuhan.1–3 As
of 11th February 2020, there are increasing reports of large scale transmission and numbers of cases
in other places in China.4,5 In addition, there are now reports of cases in multiple countries outside of
China, and limited reports of transmission within countries outside of China.5
From January 23rd travel from Wuhan was halted by the Chinese government, and in addition many
countries have implemented measures such as airport screening, testing of patients reporting
symptoms who have recent travel from China,5 quarantining arrivals from Wuhan and/or China or
halting travel altogether.
As with many infectious diseases, there is a risk of under reporting of cases, as some people who are
infected do not seek care, some who seek care are not diagnosed and, in some settings, those who
are diagnosed may not reported. There are also particular issues in an outbreak of a novel pathogen
due to difficulties in mobilizing the response and in development of testing capacities, as well as
changes over time in the definition of SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms. There are therefore concerns
the reported cases in countries outside of China may be an under-report of what is actually
occurring. Previous work has estimated significant under reporting of COVID-19 cases in a number of
countries such as Indonesia, Cambodia and Thailand.6 A detailed understanding of the geographical
distribution of case importation will help to guide resources to places with currently limited capacity
to test, and provide support to perform control measures and support for clinical care.
Flight data has been used to determine connectivity between countries and therefore risk of onward
transmission from China to other countries. Early in the outbreak, Bogoch et al. listed the countries
at most risk of importations given the number of flights from Wuhan. 7 Their ranking ultimately
followed closely the countries that first reported imported cases, albeit with some countries
predicted to report that did not. Since then others have used flight and other data to highlight
countries at most risk of importation of SARS-CoV-2 from China. 8,9 These papers have then used the
infectious disease vulnerability index (IDVI) as an assessment of how at risk a country is to local
transmission. 8,9
In countries where importations are occurring, it will be important to quantify the risk of onward
transmission occurring and the extent of this transmission. Kucharski et al. 10 considered this
generally given the number of importations using a probabilistic model, and Wu et al estimated a
probability of transmission within cities outside China. 4 However risk estimates of importations to
countries outside China have been focused on the risk of importations from mainland China, with
the risk being correlated with the connectivity of places in mainland China to other countries.7–9 As
transmission increasingly occurs in countries outside mainland China it may also become important
to consider the risk of importations to and from other countries. Indeed there have already been
cases outside of China, only reporting travel history to countries outside of China, such as from
Singapore to the UK,11 and from Thailand, Singapore and Japan to South Korea.12 In light of this,
there is some urgency to assessing the relative risks of onward transmission between countries
outside of China.
Therefore in this paper we estimate 1) the number of imported cases globally from Wuhan (using
flight data and the currently reported cases), then using our estimates of the number of imported

cases and current estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2 we estimate, 2) the probability of an outbreak in
countries outside mainland China, and finally given this outbreak risk and the flights between
countries outside mainland China, we estimate 3) the risk index for importations occurring from and
to countries outside mainland China. There is, of course, large uncertainty in these values and we
propagate the uncertainty through the estimates.

Methods
Data
Case data
We used the information on the date, location, and travel history of each reported COVID-19 case,
which was synthesized and made publicly available by the nCoV-2019 Data Working Group. 13 For
each country or territory outside of mainland China, we collated data on the total number of
reported COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan only (not from other places in China), based on the
epidemiological data updated as of 7th February—15 days since the Wuhan shutdown (Table S1). For
a small number of cases, we were unable to identify the cities from which they were imported. We
included these into our data as having originated from Wuhan to avoid producing false positive
results when we later on identified countries that may have under-detected SARS-CoV-2 importation
from Wuhan.
Flight data
We used the monthly number of air ticket bookings during 2017 from the Official Airline Guide 14 to
approximate the volumes of air passengers for each origin-destination route.
Statistical analyses
For each country or territory outside of mainland China (denoted by 𝑖), we assumed that the total
number of COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan (𝑀𝑖 ) followed a Poisson distribution with rate
parameter proportional to the number of air travelers from Wuhan during January 2020
(𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑖,𝐽𝑎𝑛 ), with an unknown coefficient 𝜆0 to be estimated from data (more detail in supporting
information):
𝑀𝑖 ~𝑃𝑜(𝜆0 ∙ 𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑖,𝐽𝑎𝑛 ).
To date, the reported total number of imported cases from Wuhan (𝑋𝑖 ) differ substantially between
countries even after adjusting for the volumes of air passengers arriving from Wuhan. We assumed
this was due to inter-country variation in case detection and reporting rates. We ranked countries
based on the ratio between the reported case count 𝑋𝑖 and passenger volume 𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑖,𝐽𝑎𝑛 , and
assumed all the imported COVID-19 cases from Wuhan have been successfully detected and
reported by countries having the top 10 rankings, to provide a conservative estimate for 𝜆0 and
hence the number of cases imported from Wuhan to the rest of the countries we consider. In the
equation below, Θ refers to the set of the aforementioned countries having the highest rankings,
and the posterior of 𝜆0 follows a gamma distribution if we impose a uniform prior:
𝑓(𝜆0 ) ∝ 1,
𝜆0 | {𝑋𝑗 |𝑗 ∈ Θ} ~ Γ (∑ 𝑋𝑗 + 1 , ∑ 𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑗,𝐽𝑎𝑛 ).
𝑗∈Θ

𝑗∈Θ

The posterior predictive distribution of the estimated number of COVID-19 cases imported from
Wuhan to each country 𝑖 ∉ Θ is thus a Gamma-Poisson mixture. Alternatively, this can be viewed as
a negative binomial distribution that models the number of failures before the (∑𝑗∈Θ 𝑋𝑗 + 1)th
success in a series of independent and identical Bernoulli trials, each with probability of

success ∑𝑗∈Θ 𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑗,𝐽𝑎𝑛 ⁄(∑𝑗∈Θ 𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑗,𝐽𝑎𝑛 + 𝑣𝑊𝐻→𝑖,𝐽𝑎𝑛 ). Subsequently, we computed the 95%
uncertainty interval for the total number of COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan to each
country 𝑖 ∉ Θ. The left tail probability P(𝑀𝑖 ≤ 𝑋𝑖 ) can also be used to identify countries that may
have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan.
Next, we propagated the uncertainty in the estimated number of imported COVID-19 cases from
Wuhan, and estimated the probability that a local outbreak would occur and sustain for at least
three generations (hereinafter referred to as “local outbreak risk”) for each country or territory
outside mainland China. We modelled the offspring distribution of each case as a negative binomial
distribution, with mean equal to the basic reproduction number estimated by Riou et al. 15, and
dispersion parameter assumed to be equal to that of SARS-CoV.16 Using the first-step analysis, the
local outbreak risk can be mathematically derived, where we created two scenarios for each
country: (1) only the reported cases imported from Wuhan were immediately isolated, but the rest
of the estimated cases were not (main analysis) and (2) immediate isolation of 95% of the estimated
imported cases from Wuhan. Here, we assumed that immediately isolated cases were not able to
cause any secondary infection throughout their infectious periods, and hence the local outbreak risk
estimation was conservative. For the main analysis, we truncated the uncertainty distribution of the
imported case count derived earlier using the reported case count, to ensure that the estimated
total number of cases imported from Wuhan was always greater than or equal to the reported case
count. Countries with a local outbreak risk above 0.5 in our main analysis were named as potential
donor countries, and subsequently assessed for their relative potential of exporting SARS-CoV-2 to
any recipient country or territory outside mainland China, described as follows.
For each recipient country outside mainland China 𝑟, we derived a COVID-19 introduction
index 𝛾𝑑→𝑟 (on a relative scale) that ranks potential donor countries 𝑑 in terms of their viral
exportation potential. This was expressed as the product of the probability of travelling from a
potential donor country 𝑑 to a recipient country 𝑟 in February, and the local outbreak risk 𝜔𝑑 , where
the total population size in each potential donor country (𝑃𝑂𝑃𝑑 ) was based on the data published by
the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Centre 17. In addition, we also derived the total COVID-19
introduction index estimate for each recipient country 𝑟 (𝛾∙→𝑟 ) by summing over all the potential
donor countries 𝑑:
𝛾𝑑→𝑟 ≔ 𝜔𝑑 ∙

Results
Outside of mainland China, most countries or territories we estimate as having a large number of
COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan are located in Asia (Figure 1 and Table S1). Outside Asia, we
estimate United States, Australia, and United Kingdom as having the highest imported case count
estimates (Figure 1 and Table S1). In addition, we also identify countries whose reported number of
imported cases from Wuhan is less than the 5th percentile of the posterior predictive distribution of
our imported case estimates (Table 1), suggesting under-detected cases imported from Wuhan in
these countries or territories. In particular, we estimate that Thailand received 97 (95% CI: 66–136)
imported cases from Wuhan—the largest among all the countries analyzed but have only reported
~20 cases (Table 1). For Indonesia there have not been any reported COVID-19 cases imported from
Wuhan, and yet we estimate at least 19 (95% CI: 10–30) imported cases.
If we assume each country has immediately isolated all the reported cases imported from Wuhan
(and therefore truncated transmission), but not isolated the extra cases we estimated and that no
extra control measures are put in place, we estimate that the chance that local transmission would
occur and sustain for at least three generations exceeds 50% for a total of 16 countries or territories,
including four outside Asia: Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and United States (Table 2). In a
second scenario, where we assume that 95% of all the imported cases from Wuhan were
immediately isolated, the estimated local outbreak risk reduces substantially, with only Thailand
having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50%. Still, the estimated risk of local transmission
sustaining for at least three generations is not negligible (> 20%) in many other countries or
territories, including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, United States, Malaysia, and Singapore
(Table 2 for the countries or territories having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50% in the
main analysis, and Figure 2 & Table S2 for results obtained for all countries or territories outside of
mainland China). For countries where we estimate a large number of unreported cases, the local
outbreak risk is ranked higher in the first scenario than the second scenario, as the extra estimated
cases not being detected means a higher risk of onward transmission compared to countries where
we estimate higher detection (Table 2).
For each recipient country or territory outside mainland China, we assess the relative potential of
COVID-19 introduction from each donor country that has a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding
50%. For example, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia are found to have the highest COVID-19
introduction index estimates when we consider the United Kingdom as the recipient country. Using
the United Kingdom, United States, South Korea, and South Africa as recipient country examples, we
highlight the top donor countries or territories based on the COVID-19 introduction index estimate
for each of these countries (Figure 3). The COVID-19 introduction index estimates for all pairs of
donor-recipient countries create a network of ranked possible importation links between countries
outside mainland China (Table S3A). The total COVID-19 introduction index estimate from all the
potential donor countries is highest for Taiwan followed by Japan (full list of estimates shown in
Table S3B).

Discussion
This study quantifies, with uncertainty, the estimated number of cases imported from Wuhan to
countries outside mainland China. As we use information from the places with the highest ratio of
the reported case count to the volume of passengers from Wuhan, we are only estimating the
number of importations if these places with the highest ratio are capturing all imported cases.
Therefore our estimates should be viewed as a lower bound on the number of imported infections,
given possible mild and asymptomatic infections. Even given this, we estimate that Indonesia—
which has reported 0 cases to date—would be expected to have more cases than this, in line with
estimates from Lipsitch et al. 6. In addition, in places that have identified some cases—such as
Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the US and Malaysia—we estimate that the
imported number of cases from Wuhan is even higher than those reported. In some of these places,
testing may be already increasing, but if not, our results would suggest that these places should be
targets for increased screening and testing for SARS-CoV-2.
We next probabilistically determine the risk of local transmission within countries outside mainland
China. There is of course currently great uncertainty in these estimates, however some of the
countries we estimate with the highest probability have indeed reported (limited) local transmission
such as Thailand, the US, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the South Korea 18. This information was not
used to generate our estimates, but provides some validation for the model. In countries such as
Singapore, intensive contact tracing of cases and testing of all pneumonia cases was implemented19,
increasing the likelihood of finding community transmission. The impact of control measures after
initial detected cases is not included in our model, but may alter the risk of onward transmission and
should be considered in further iterations of the model as in other modelling work considering
impact interventions under different transmission scenarios.20,21 Other countries that we estimate to
be at high risk of local transmission, but that have not yet detected transmission 18 include
Indonesia, Cambodia, Canada and the Philippines. For all these places, our results suggest there
could be a consideration of expanding testing of pneumonia or influenza like illness cases beyond
those who have currently travelled, to find community transmission as soon as possible after it
occurs, as has been ongoing in Singapore19 and has been recommended recently in some areas of
the US 22.
We estimate that in the first wave of inter-country spread not including mainland China the
countries at highest risk are still mainly within Asia, the Pacific, North America and Europe. The first
importations of cases to and from countries outside mainland China have already occurred, including
from Singapore to the UK, 23 and Thailand, Japan and Singapore to the South Korea.12 Singapore was
second highest on our UK donor risk result list after Hong Kong and Japan, Singapore and Thailand
were numbers 4, 5 and 6 on the South Korea’s list after Macao, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Given our
results and these observations, it would seem prudent for planning to consider the scenario in which
the number of countries that may be both recipient and donors of importations will be increasing.
Once transmission is confirmed in a possible donor country, our estimates of the risk transmission
index are no longer needed, and the number of reported cases and the volume of traffic between
countries are what will become important (see Table S3). However it must be considered that
transmission may not always be detected quickly in all possible donor countries so estimates of the
risk of transmission in donor countries may remain useful for planning. Though many of the
countries at risk of second wave importations are similar to those at risk from Wuhan, there are
some countries that we did not estimate as having the highest numbers of importations from

Wuhan, but become at increased risk as we consider donor countries outside mainland China. These
include India, New Zealand, Spain and Mexico, as they have greater links to countries outside
mainland China than to Wuhan, China. With the first imported case in Africa recently reported in
Egypt 24 (which was estimated to have the highest link with mainland China by Lai et al.8,) we must
assess where we are in the timeline of the outbreak with respect to importations to Africa, and
including the risk of importation from not only mainland China could be important here.
Not included in our analysis currently is the risk of importation from places in China outside Wuhan.
There have yet not been enough importations from outside Wuhan to use our current method, and
there is currently much uncertainty on the numbers of cases in China to use this data. However as
this changes, methods using both types of data could be considered here. The links between other
places in China may follow similar patterns to Wuhan and therefore our risk of countries vulnerable
for outbreaks and sourcing onward transmission may be similar, but there may be places that are
differentially connected to Wuhan and other places in China and so will become at increased risk as
importations from China continue. In addition, flights from other places in China to different
countries will be truncated at different times for different countries depending on if and when
countries halted incoming flights from China. We also currently don’t consider travel across land or
sea borders in our analysis.
There are other limitations to our analysis. We assume that R0 in places outside of Wuhan is similar
to that estimated from early transmission in Wuhan, however we do not know how variation in
climate, population structure, contact patterns, control measures such as contact tracing and
quarantine, and other factors may impact transmission. This is an important area for future research
based on what is observed in different places and the extension of the analysis to explicitly model
transmission in each recipient country can be undertaken as more becomes known.
In summary, we estimate a number of imported cases from Wuhan that were undetected. Given
these importations, we estimate a high risk of onward transmission within a number of countries
outside mainland China, particularly in those places where cases were not detected, as these
undetected cases could not be isolated, and transmission truncated. Given our results of high risk of
onward transmission we highlight the importance of wider testing to pick up community
transmission as soon as possible after transmission occurs. We also highlight countries that become
at increased risk of importation as transmission occurs outside China, and provide results for each
country to assess the countries that pose their highest risk of importation.
