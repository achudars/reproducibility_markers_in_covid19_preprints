Abstract

21

Molecular testing for infectious diseases is generally both very sensitive and specific. Well-

22

designed PCR primers rarely cross-react with other analytes, and specificities seen during test

23

validation are often 100%. However, analytical specificities measured during validation may not

24

reflect real-world performance across the entire testing process. Here, we use the unique

25

environment of SARS-CoV-2 screening among otherwise well individuals to examine the false

26

positivity rate of high throughput so-called “sample-to-answer” nucleic acid amplification testing

27

(NAAT) on three commercial assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion, Hologic Aptima

28

transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and Roche cobas 6800. We used repetitive

29

sampling of the same person as the gold standard to determine test specificity rather than

30

retesting of the same sample. We examined 451 people repetitively sampled over 7 months via

31

nasal swab, comprising 7,242 results. During the study period there were twelve positive tests

32

(0.17%) from 9 people. Eight positive tests (0.11%, five individuals) were considered bona fide

33

true positives based on repeat positives or outside testing and epidemiological data. One

34

positive test had no follow-up testing or metadata and could not be adjudicated. Three positive

35

tests (three individuals) did not repeat as positive on a subsequent collection, nor did the

36

original positive specimen test positive on an orthogonal platform. We consider these three tests

37

false positives and estimate the overall false positive rate of high-throughput automated,

38

sample-to-answer NAAT testing to be approximately 0.041% (3/7242). These data help

39

laboratorians, epidemiologists, and regulators understand specificity and positive predictive

40

value associated with high-throughput NAAT testing.

Introduction
During assay validation, clinical tests are specifically interrogated for their sensitivity and

45

specificity. (1) Sensitivity is defined by the ability of the test to return a positive result in

46

presence of an analyte, while specificity indicates the test’s ability to return a negative result in

47

the absence of that analyte. While both are important, test specificity can be an especially

48

critical parameter for screening tests, where the vast majority of persons are negative. This fact

49

has been well-appreciated in infectious disease serological testing for viruses such as human

50

immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), but has not been widely interrogated

51

for infectious disease nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) in great detail, as the cost of

52

molecular testing has restricted its use in screening. In addition, there is little commercial

53

incentive to advertise a laboratory’s false positivity rate, even though both laboratorians and

54

physicians understand that false positives can occur at any point in the testing process.

55

The performance of molecular infectious disease testing has generally been evaluated

56

based on analytical sensitivity, since analytical specificities of most NAAT, including polymerase

57

chain reaction (PCR) tests, during validation are nearly always 100%. With the widespread

58

availability of genomic data today, it is generally facile to specifically design PCR primer and

59

probe sets to avoid cross-reaction with other analytes. While several SARS-CoV-2 primer sets

60

were initially designed to specifically cross-react with SARS-CoV or potentially other

61

Sarbecovirus members, no primer sets were specifically designed to cross-react with other

62

known circulating human viruses. (2)

63

Given the long-term shedding associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (over half of

64

previously hospitalized patients in a multicenter study in the United States had a positive PCR

65

test at 3 weeks or longer following their first positive test) and the superlative analytical

66

sensitivity of NAAT, adjudicating the trueness of low viral load positives can be difficult. (3)

67

Retesting a positive specimen on an orthogonal testing platform may help determine true

68

analytical positivity if the second test is positive, but a negative test may not be specifically

69

informative if the viral load is at the analytical limit of detection (LoD). An alternative method to

70

determine false positivity would be to recollect individuals, though this still has problems with

71

stochasticity of samples, especially at the LoD.

72

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic creates an intriguing use case to examine the overall false

73

positivity rate associated with large-scale NAAT, as millions of tests were performed daily

74

across the United States in 2020-21. Many employers such as technology companies or sports

75

teams specifically tested their employees every day or every other day to prevent widespread

76

transmission within their organization. Our clinical laboratory performed almost half of testing

77

within Washington State and offered repeat longitudinal testing to several employer groups that

78

had exceptionally low positivity rates. Here, we use this data to specifically interrogate the false

79

positivity rate associated with high-throughput, so called “sample-to-answer” assays employed

80

in our laboratory: Hologic Panther Fusion, the Hologic Aptima transcription mediated

81

amplification (TMA), and Roche cobas 6800.

Materials and Methods

84

Description of cohort and testing

85

This study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

86

Three different, high-throughput sample-to-answer platforms for SARS-CoV-2 testing were used

87

during the study period: the Hologic Panther Fusion, Hologic Aptima TMA, and the Roche

88

cobas 6800 assays. The Panther Fusion assay targets two conserved regions of the SARS-

89

CoV-2 open reading frame (ORF) 1ab gene; amplification of either or both regions produces a

90

presumptive positive test result and amplification of neither target results a negative test result.

91

The Roche cobas6800 assay targets two regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the envelope

92

(E) gene and ORF1ab gene. Amplification of both targets results in a presumptive positive test

93

result, while amplification of one of two targets results in an inconclusive result, and

94

amplification of neither target results a negative test result. The Aptima TMA assay targets two

95

conserved regions of the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene; amplification of either or both regions

96

produces a presumptive positive test result and amplification of neither target results a negative

97

test result. An in-house laboratory developed test (LDT) for SARS-CoV-2 was also in use during

98

this time but the results from the LDT are not included in the present analysis as it is a not a

99

commercial, high-throughput platform. However, testing on the LDT is incorporated into the

100

statistics regarding testing frequency for transparency and completeness. Cycle time (Ct)

101

parameters for the commercial assays are considered proprietary and not publicly available.

102

However, Ct results are reported on the instrument for positive or inconclusive tests on both the

103

Panther Fusion and Roche cobas 6800 assays (Table 1).

104

Testing was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use (IFU) as

105

detailed in each respective assay’s emergency use authorization (EUA) through the United

106

States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and as validated for use in the University of

107

Washington Clinical Virology Lab. The inclusion criteria for samples in this study was any

108

location/employer which had a requirement to confirm any positive result on an orthogonal

109

platform as well as re-collect the patient/employee and re-test within 24 hours to confirm the

110

initial positive result. The specimens were nasal swabs collected at each respective

111

location’s/employer’s facility according to established protocols. Transport to the University of

112

Washington Clinical Virology lab was done in universal transport media (UTM) or viral transport

113

media (VTM). Specimens were processed and run within 72 hours of collection if refrigerated or

114

frozen within 72 hours of collection.

115

Common preanalytical steps shared by all specimens regardless of assay included

116

aliquoting of the specimen in a biosafety cabinet and transfer of the aliquot to a reaction vessel

117

appropriate for use on the testing platforms. Positive results were deemed “false positives” if the

118

subsequent sample from the same individual was negative, regardless of platform, and,

119

similarly, “true positives” were assigned if the subsequent sample was also positive with a flat or

120

increasing viral load (flat or decreasing Ct). Additionally, positive samples preceded by an

121

inconclusive result were also considered “true positives.”

Data analysis
Data for the populations of interest was extracted from the Department of Laboratory

125

Medicine and Pathology’s data warehouse that contains patient demographics and laboratory

126

order and result data that are extracted from our laboratory information system (Sunquest

127

Laboratory version 8.1, Tuscon, AZ). Individuals were eligible if they met the above inclusion

128

criteria and had at least two molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed on a high-throughput

129

platform during the study period (May-November 2020). Data analysis was performed using

130

RStudio (Version 1.2.1335) and Microsoft Excel.

Results

133

A total of 451 people repetitively tested over a seven-month period from May to

134

November 2020 were included in the analysis. The median age of those tested was 27 years

135

old (interquartile range, IQR, 23-33 years). A total of 7,242 SARS-CoV-2 tests were performed

136

on the high-throughput assays during the study period; all specimens were nasal swabs. The

137

median number of tests per individual was 10 (IQR 6-16) and the median number of days

138

between consecutive tests was 2.1 days (IQR 2-5 days). There were 12 positive (detected)

139

results during the study period (0.17%) from 9 people (Figure 1 and Table 2). There was one

140

inconclusive result (0.013%) from one person and was followed by a positive result. The number

141

of total and positive results by platform were as follows: Panther Fusion, 1932 (26.7%, six

142

positive); Aptima TMA, 1526 (21.0%, four positive), and Roche cobas 6800, 3784 (52.3%,

143

two positive).

144

Of the positive results, three were interpreted as false positives as a subsequent

145

collection was negative (Cases 2, 3, and 6). All of specimens which gave false positive results

146

failed to repeat as positive when testing the original parent sample or the aliquot on an

147

orthogonal platform. Only one false positive test had an accompanying Ct value (31.8). The

148

mean time to subsequent collection was 3 days (range 1 to 7 days). Two of the false positive

149

cases (Cases 2 and 3) did not have a preceding result in our system, but did have repetitive

150

testing at an outside lab that was negative per report. We estimate the overall false positive rate

151

of high-throughput automated molecular testing to be approximately 0.041%.

152

A total of five cases were interpreted true positives. Two positive cases had static or

153

decreasing Ct value on consecutive tests performed in our laboratory (Cases 7 and 8, Figure 2).

154

One case (Case 1) had a positive test result that was followed by a repeat positive test

155

performed at an outside laboratory a day later (no Ct value available). The fourth case (Case 4)

156

was interpreted as clinical true positive as the patient developed symptoms within one day of

157

testing and had close contact with a person known to have COVID-19; no subsequent testing

158

was performed on this individual. Lastly, Case 5 had a positive result following an inconclusive

159

result, which is consistent with detecting an early infection, and we count as a true positive. All

160

of the true positive results were positive using the same specimen on an orthogonal platform.

161

The average Ct value of the five true positives for which this data was available on the primary

162

testing platform was 29.5 and the mean time to subsequent collection was 2.97 days (range 1 to

163

6 days). Lastly, there was one positive result which cannot be adjudicated as a true or false

164

positive using our criteria as there was no subsequent collection. However, this sample

165

repeated as positive on an orthogonal platform using the same specimen suggesting it may

166

have been a true positive as well.

169

Discussion
We present an estimate of the false positive rate of high-throughput, so called “sample-

170

to-answer” NAAT for SARS-CoV-2 derived from a healthy, relatively young repetitively sampled

171

population. The overall false positive rate of 0.041% is quite low and concordant with the

172

reported specificity of currently available PCR primers. However, when considering the

173

magnitude of testing for SARS-CoV-2 currently performed on a daily basis in the United States,

174

the number of false positives becomes of greater clinical concern (820 individuals daily if using

175

the figure of two million daily tests in the United States).

176

It is unclear at which stage of the testing process the false positives we identified

177

originated. The preanalytical stage is most likely as the vast majority of laboratory errors occur

178

during this part of the testing process. (4) Between accessioning and aliquoting into instrument-

179

compatible tubes, the manual manipulation required for testing on automated platforms is still

180

considerable. The analytical stage is also a possibility. As detailed in the study by Lin et al.

181

(2020) false positives can occur during testing due to cross-contamination between neighboring

182

samples when one is a strong positive, resulting in a weak false positive in an adjacent sample.

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.25.21254890; this version posted April 27, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

183

(5) Side-by-side sample cross-contamination was determined to be the cause for 39 of 40

184

(97.5%) of the false positive results they identified, and led to specific changes in their test

185

procedures including the use of more blanks and reduction in the wash volumes during

186

extraction steps to reduce the risk of splashing. (5) However, their testing was limited to an

187

open, conventional extraction and amplification workflow similar to a laboratory developed test

188

and not the closed, sample-to-answer testing that comprise the results detailed here. Their

189

overall false positive rate of 0.1% is similar to the estimate of 0.041% we obtained.

190

Additionally, there is the cautionary tale of contamination of test reagents, particularly the

191

non-template controls, by synthetic SARS-CoV-2 oligonucleotides which delayed

192

implementation of RT-PCR testing for the virus in the European Union in January and February

193

of 2020. (6) Similar contamination plagued the rollout of the US Center for Disease Control and

194

Prevention’s (CDC) own SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test kits in February and March of 2020 and

195

other instances of contamination of commercial reagents have been published. (7, 8) These

196

examples reinforce the need for stringent laboratory quality control procedures, including routine

197

examination of new lots of test reagent, and vigilance for patterns of positivity which fall outside

198

of expectations (clusters of positive results, side-by-side positives, or any instance of suspected

199

human error during the manual steps of the process).

200

Another factor are the unique performance characteristics of the assays. Although

201

generally comparable in clinical use, sensitivity and specificity of the tests is not uniform, and

202

they target distinct molecular regions of SARS-CoV-2. (9, 10) Also, the technologies used by

203

each assay are also not the same; the Aptima TMA assay is an isothermal technology that

204

creates a chemiluminescent signal read by a luminometer, reported in relative light units (RLU),

205

and relies on differences in signal kinetics to generate results whereas the other platforms

206

produce a fluorescent signal and amplify target transcripts using traditional thermal cycling after

207

reverse transcription (RT-PCR). While the Aptima TMA assay has been reported to be more

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.25.21254890; this version posted April 27, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

208

sensitive than comparable RT-PCR assays, our data suggests this may come at the cost of

209

false positive results. (11) Two out of three of our false positive cases occurred using the

210

Aptima TMA assay (Case 2 and 3). These positive tests had RLU values of 614 and 615

211

respectively, which is between the average RLU of 300 for negative samples and 1153 for

212

0.5xLoD samples in the manufacturer’s IFU, likely indicating that these results were close to the

213

assays LoD.

214

Lastly, all laboratory test results should be interpreted within the context of their pretest

215

probability of disease. In our cohort of generally well, young individuals tested in the period prior

216

to the recent winter surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States, the pretest probability

217

for infection was low (the Washington State SARS-CoV-2 test positivity rate was 3.7% to 10.2%

218

during the study period). (12) Of the eight positive cases with either clinical follow-up or

219

subsequent testing, five were deemed to be bona fide true positives (62.5%) and three were

220

false positives (37.5%). This finding underscores that even tests with superlative specificity can

221

yield a substantial percentage of false positive results under circumstances of low pretest

222

probability. (13)

223

False positive results for SARS-CoV-2 have real-world implications ranging from the

224

psychological, at the person level, to financial and societal, at the global level, stemming from

225

workplace interruptions, travel restrictions, and misspent financial and human resources. (14)

226

From our data, repeat testing of the same specimen on an orthogonal platform (if available) is

227

valuable in situations with low pre-test probability. All of the false positive tests did not repeat as

228

positive on an orthogonal platform while all true positives repeated as positive by another assay.

229

Repeat collection and testing of another specimen, ideally within a short (several day)

230

timeframe, can also serve to identify false positive results.

231

There are several limitations to the work presented here. This study was performed at a

232

single site and our measured false positivity rate is likely dependent on our own testing

233

processes. This analysis only covers high-throughput automated platforms. Other PCR methods

234

that use a 96 well plate format which involve sample transfers and manipulation likely will

235

experience a higher false positivity rate. The individuals tested here were not uniformly sampled

236

in time after a positive result. Also, the specimen type, nasal swab, may have influenced the

237

positive rate. Nasopharyngeal swabs are considered the gold standard, with a higher rate of

238

positivity compared to other, less invasive sample types. (15) Specimens which resulted as

239

negative after a prior positive were not repeated on an orthogonal platform, thus raising the

240

specter of false negatives. It is unclear how generalizable these numbers are to other

241

laboratories or platforms. More work is required to understand the inherent false positivity rate

242

associated with the automated platforms in use within our laboratory.

Figure 1 – Testing Frequency and Positive Cases

307

The frequency of testing in our cohort during the study period was high with a median of 2.1

308

days between tests and median of 10 tests per individual. Individuals with a positive (detected)

309

result are broken out in panel A and all results are shown in panel B. Two true positive cases

310

were judged according to outside laboratory data or clinical symptoms; the positive result in

311

Case 1 was followed by a positive repeat test at an outside laboratory a day later and the

312

positive result in Case 4 (*) was interpreted as clinical true positive as the patient developed

313

symptoms within one day of testing and had close contact with a person known to have COVID-

314

19.

Figure 2 – True Positive and False Positives with Ct values over Time

317

Positive SARS-CoV-2 results with available cycle time (Ct) values and follow-up are shown

318

longitudinally in relation to their immediate prior and subsequent results (represented in days

319

since the first positive test, time zero). True positives are characterized by a decrease in Ct

320

value that repeats on subsequent testing whereas false positives show a brief dip in Ct followed

321

by a negative test. A single case (Case 5) had an inconclusive result prior to the positive test

322

(amplification of a single target one day prior) and is considered a true positive of an early

323

infection. All positive results with Ct values on the primary diagnostic platform are included. A

324

Ct value of 40 was assigned to negative results for illustration purpose.
