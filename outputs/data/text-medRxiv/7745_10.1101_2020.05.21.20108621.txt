A pandemic at the Tunisian scale
Mathematical modelling of reported and unreported COVID-19 infected cases
Ines Abdeljaoued-Tej

Submitted: May 21, 2020

Abstract Starting from the city of Wuhan in China in late December 2019, the pandemic quickly spread
to the rest of the world along the main intercontinental air routes. At the time of writing this article, there
are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country
to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to
examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the
actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are
officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based
on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between
infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases.
This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR
model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t),
and unreported infected cases U (t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R0 , which is the
average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R0 = 2.73.
Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing
and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an Rt = 0.42
(95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the
management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however
necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).

1 Introduction
Given the fragile health systems in most countries, we studied the data available in Tunisia as well as their
possible evolution. This work presents a methodology for tracking the epidemic’s numbers. It is based on
mathematical models, starting from a simple multiplication via the mortality rate [1], to a study of ordinary
differential equations [13] and also to a simulation based on the Bayes theorem for the derivation of the
daily reproduction rate [4]. We used a deterministic SEIR model. The main objective of this work is the
estimation of the average number of infections one case can generate throughout the infectious period. It is
the basic and effective reproduction number of an infectious agent.

The COVID-19 morbidity rate in Tunisia, that is, the ratio of the number of people infected to the total
Tunisian population, is around 8.73 per 100 000 population. It is the number of infected cases or incidence.
The death rate representing the number of people who died from COVID-19 in Tunisia is 0.4 per 100 000
people. The real indicator of the danger of the epidemic is the fatality rate, which represents the proportion
of deaths compared to the total number of infected cases. The fatality rate for COVID-19 in Tunisia is 0.044
per 100 000 people. These values are temporary and incomplete. They were based on the tests carried out
(the polymerase chain reaction, denoted by PCR, has a sensitivity of 70% [7]). The number of deaths is
recorded in hospitals and does not include deaths at home (therefore of cases not reported). But these figures
remain an indicator to contain the outbreak and prepare for targeted containment or release of confinement.
We use a set of reported data to model the epidemic in Tunisia. It is shared by the Tunisian Ministry of
Health and it represents the epidemic transmission in this country. The first case was detected on March 5,
2020. Forty-five dead were reported on May 11, 2020, with 1032 total number of infected cases: the dataset
is available in Table 2, and Fig. 8 gives the geographical distribution by Tunisia’s regions. The three phases
of COVID-19 epidemics as defined in [11] can be decomposed as a linear phase, exponential growth, and
decreasing stage. The linear growth in the number of reported cases (from March 5 to March 24) is where
the number of daily reported cases is almost constant day after day. The second phase of the epidemic corresponds to an exponential increasing phase, it starts on March 25, 2020. The third phase of the epidemic
starts on April 17, 2020. It corresponds to a time-dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate, due
to major public interventions and social distancing measures.
In practice, epidemiological data typically permit the estimation of the effective reproduction number Rt .
If the basic reproduction number R0 is greater than 1, countries need to take action because the progression
of the virus could lead to an exponential phase. If it is less than 1 then new cases per day go to zero.
Changes in transmission speed over time are recommended to bring it down the critical threshold of 1. We
address the following fundamental issues concerning this epidemic in Tunisia: How will the epidemic evolve
concerning the number of reported cases and unreported cases? How will the number of unreported cases
influence the severity of the epidemic? What is the effect of the massive containment policies (decided on
March 25, 2020, in Tunisia) on the epidemic? To answer these questions, we developed mathematical models
that recover from data of reported cases and the number of unreported cases for the COVID-19 epidemic.

2 Methods
The average number of people contaminated by a COVID-19 infected person is central in studying epidemics.
This number is denoted by R0 : if it is less than 1, a patient infects on average less than one individual, and
the disease disappears from the population over time. Conversely, if R0 > 1, the disease can spread in the
population and become epidemic. This number, therefore, makes it possible to determine if the epidemic
can spread in the population, at what speed (doubling time), and with what magnitude. Its calculation
requires the use of more or fewer complex models.
Compartmental models were created in the 1930s by Kermack and McKendrick [5]. The principle is
to divide the population into epidemiological classes such as those susceptible to infection, those who are
infectious, and those who have recovered and acquired immunity or are deceased. The state of the epidemic
is determined by knowing the size of these three classes of the population. At each point in time t, we can
consider the number S(t) of susceptible people, the number I(t) of infected people, and the number R(t) of
recovered (and therefore immune) or deceased people. Each of these quantities is a function of time t, which
we cannot measure at all times, but it is measured regularly at certain times (for example daily or hourly),
and these measures provide both an abstract model of this function and a daily assessment of the epidemic.
The functions S(t), I(t) and R(t) are linked to each other bylaws that describe how they influence each
other. For example, their sum S(t) + I(t) + R(t) represents the total population which therefore remains
constant over time.

A pandemic at the Tunisian scale

The SEIR model is a little more elaborate. It is obtained from the SIR model by adding a new epidemiological class to take into account the duration of incubation, namely exposed people (infected non-infectious)
who are therefore not contagious, represented by the function E(t). The purpose of the model is to predict
forward in time the future number of cases in a time-line of the epidemic from early reported case data.
A typical SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed) model is given in [10]. Assume that infected
individuals were not infectious during the incubation period [25]. Assume population growth rate and death
rate are zero. Assume people exhibit consistent behaviours before and during epidemic phase [26]. Assume
no quarantine or other mitigation intervention is implemented. All these assumptions directly influence the
model, which is dependent on several parameters. See [20] for a more precise idea of the evolution of these
assumptions. Sophisticated SEIR/SIRU models are developed in [21], but we choose to follow the approach
of [11] to have a starting point of view of the epidemic. It produces a result closer to the realistic basic
reproductive number R0 .
The study we are presenting is based on a refined SEIR model, tested at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic in China or France [13], and in Palestine [2], which takes into account three classes of infected
populations represented by functions A(t), U (t) and V (t). Any of these infected populations can transmit
the virus to susceptible people S(t). The first class, represented by the function A(t), is made up of people
infected but who do not know it, called asymptomatic. The other infected people, called symptomatic,
are divided into two classes represented by the functions U (t) and V (t). The function U (t) represents
symptomatic people not listed by the public authorities. They are infected people with symptoms but who
do not know they are carrying the virus. They are therefore not officially recognised as infected (either
because the COVID-19 test turned out to be negative, or because they simply escaped the various checks
put in place). The population of those who are symptomatic, infected, and who tested positive for the virus
are represented by the function V (t). The other laws which describe the evolution of the epidemic can be
represented by the following diagram in Fig. 1:

The infected people are thus divided into asymptomatic A(t) and symptomatic U (t) and V (t). Only
those infected who have tested positive for the virus, represented by the function V (t), are known to the
public authorities. These are the ones that appear in the daily reports of the epidemic. However, the three
population classes A(t), U (t) and V (t) are carriers of a highly contagious infection. Draconian control is
applied to class V (t) to avoid contact with class S(t) of healthy people who are likely to be infected. However,
the latter can be infected by both classes A(t) and U (t), with a transmission rate β: it represents the rate of
susceptible people who become infected when in contact with contaminated persons. In this refined model,
there are therefore βS(t)(A(t) + U (t)) newly infected people. The model also takes into account the number
of days n from which symptoms appear on carriers of the virus (estimated at 7 days for COVID-19). After
this period of n days, only the proportion f of asymptomatic people become symptomatic and test positive.
They are added to the class V (t). The rest of the asymptomatic population, namely (1 − f )A(t), escapes
the mesh of control and is added to the class U (t). Every day, class A(t) therefore contributes to class V (t)
by f A(t)/n people and to class U (t) by (1 − f )A(t)/n people. Finally, part of the symptomatic U (t) and
V (t) is removed after a certain number of days with a rate η. We obtain, by noting the inverse of n by ν:

This system is supplemented by initial data S(t0 ) = S0 > 0, A(t0 ) = A0 > 0, V (t0 ) = 0 and U (t0 ) =
U0 ≥ 0, where, t0 is the beginning date of the epidemic, t ≥ t0 is time in days. The parameters are listed in

Table 1 Parameters and initial conditions of the model

We assume that the removal rate ν is the sum of the removal rate of reported symptomatic infectious
individuals, and of the removal rate of unreported symptomatic infectious individuals due to all other causes,
such as mild symptoms, or other reasons. The cumulative number of reported symptomatic infectious cases
at time t is denoted by CR(t). We assume that CR(t) has the following special form:
CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3 .
We obtain the model starting time of the epidemic t0 :
CR(t0 ) = 0

⇔

χ1 exp(χ2 t0 ) − χ3 = 0

⇒

t0 =

ln(χ3 ) − ln(χ1 )

We fix S0 to 11 818 619, which corresponds to the total population of Tunisia. We assume that the variation
in S(t) is small during the period considered, and we fix ν, η, f . We can estimate the parameter β and

the initial conditions U0 and A0 from the cumulative reported cases CR(t). We then construct numerical
simulations and compare them with data. We obtain A(t) = A0 exp(χ2 (t − t0 )) and A0 = χ2 /(f ν). We
must have U (t) = U0 exp(χ2 (t − t0 )). So, by substituting these expressions into previous identities, we
obtain: χ2 A0 = βS0 (A0 + U0 ) − νA0 , χ2 U0 = (1 − f )ν I0 − ηU ,
β=

S0

and U0 = A0 ((1 − f )ν)/(η + χ2 ). We fix β such that the value χ2 becomes the dominant eigenvalue of

and (A0 , U0 ) is the positive eigenvector associated with this dominant eigenvalue χ2 . Thus, we apply implicitly the Perron–Frobenius theorem. Moreover, the exponentially growing solution (A(t), U (t)) that we
consider (which is starting very close to (0, 0)) follows the direction of the positive eigenvector associated
with the dominant eigenvalue χ2 .
The need to impose lock-down comes from the classes of infected but unreported, that is, A(t) and U (t):
A(t) = A0 exp(χ2 (t − t0 ))

and

U (t) = U0 exp(χ2 (t − t0 ))

These two functions are not known at any given time t. Their objective estimation and the study of their
evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to
an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable
or unreliable tests).
The basic reproductive number becomes:
R0 =

η

It is a single measure that does not adapt to changes in behaviour and restrictions. By definition, R0
is an intrinsic property of an outbreak and does not change once calculated, as it is calculated assuming a
fully susceptible population. On the other hand, the effective reproduction rate Rt is a relevant indicator to
qualify contagiousness. Every day t, a new case count of infected people gives us a clue about the current
value of Rt . It figures that the value of Rt a day t is related to the value of Rt−1 and every previous value
of Rt−j (from day t − j to t − 1). As a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions change Rt . If the effective
reproduction number Rt is smaller than R0 , then it reduces the number of infected people, and it reduces
the number of future infected people. Stopping containment, resuming international flights without any
physical distancing measure, will affect Rt (which is likely to rise above 1).
In order to compute Rt we apply a modified version of a solution used in [4] and trained by Kevin
Systrom, Adam Lerer and Frank Dellaert1 . It introduces a process model with Gaussian noise to estimate
a time-varying Rt . It uses Bayes’ rule to update Rt based on how many new cases have been reported each
day:
P (k|Rt ) ∗ P (Rt )
,
P (Rt |k) =
P (k)
where P (k|Rt ) is the likelihood of seeing k new cases given Rt times, P (Rt ) is the prior beliefs of the value
of Rt without the data, and P (k) the probability of seeing this many cases in general. To make it iterative:
every day that passes, we use yesterday’s prior P (Rt−1 ) to estimate today’s prior P (Rt ). We assume the
distribution of Rt to be a Gaussian centred around Rt−1 , so P (Rt |Rt−1 ) = N (Rt−1 , σ), where σ is a
hyper-parameter. So on day one:
P (R1 |k1 ) ∝ P (R1 ) ∗ L(R1 |k1 ).

By definition, the likelihood function L(R1 |k1 ) is conditioned on the observed k1 and it is a function of the
unknown parameter R1 . On day two:
P (R2 |k1 , k2 ) ∝ P (R2 ) ∗ L(R2 |k2 ) =

Rt−1

A likelihood function says how likely we are to see k new cases, given a value of Rt : Given an average
arrival rate of λ new cases per day, the probability of seeing k new cases is distributed according to the
Poisson distribution: P (k|λ) = λk exp (−λ)/k!. There’s a connection between Rt and λ:
λ = kt−1 ∗ exp (η(Rt − 1))
where kt is the number of infected cases at day t, and 1/η is the serial interval defined as an average residence
time when infectious individuals recover or die [22].

3 Data description
The data available in [6] gives the number of COVID-19 positive cases per day, the number of deaths due to
COVID-19, and the number of reported recoveries (see Table 2). The daily growth rate of the infected cases
in Fig. 2 is given by: (Cj − Cj−1 )/Cj−1 in day j, where Cj is the number of reported COVID-19 cases at
time j. The median of the daily growth rate of reported cases in Tunisia from March 5 to 11th May 2020 is
equal to 0.24%. The total number of deaths is 45. It represents a fatality rate of 4.36% of total reported cases.

Fig. 2 Data on reported infected cases and death cases in Tunisia were collected from January 23, 2020. The first infected
case was reported on March 5. On May 11 the daily number of reported cases was zero. Based on the Ministry of Health
data, we can say that the first wave of infection has passed.

Patients who die on a given day j were infected much earlier, so the mortality rate denominator should
be the total number of patients infected at the same time as those who died [24]. To measure a death
ratio, a delay of 18 days is used between the mortality number and the infected number. This delay is
justified by the days between infection and death, which is about 17 to 19 days [8]. The relationships between deaths a given day j and the number of cases 18 days before (j − 18) are linear for Tunisia, as shown
in Fig. 3. The mortality rate is defined by T18 = Mj /Cj−18 where Mj is the total number of deaths at time j.

The median mortality rate during this period is equal to 0.12. The progression of the number of cases
reported over the last eighteen days P18 is known in each country. It depends on the rate of containment
and its effectiveness: P18 = Cj /Cj−18 . Fig. 3 shows the progression rate of COVID-19 in Tunisia. The
median of P18 is equal to 1.86 and it is used to compute the estimated number of reported and unreported
cases [1]. We estimate the number of cases in Tunisia as of May 11th , 2020 by modulating the estimated
mortality rate: For example, if the mortality rate is 2%, then the actual cases on May 11 is estimated at 2 555.

Fig. 3 Relationships between deaths a given day j and the number of cases 18 days before j − 18 is linear for Tunisia. The
progression rate P18 is equal to 25.28 on April 2 and decreases to 1.14 on May 11, 2020.

On the other hand, we scale the number of deaths per 100 000 population due to COVID-19 related to
the number of registered infected people per 100 000 population. Tunisia appears to be doing rather well,
compared to other countries [2], with a ratio of deaths per 100 000 population to infected cases per 100 000
population equal to 0.05. The incubation period for COVID-19 is very important: it is a time during which
individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves.

4 Results
The first infected case in Tunisia was documented on March 5, 2020. According to data, the time t = 0
will correspond to 5 March. It is used as the first day of the forecast. Fitting Tunisian data from March 25
to April 1st enables to compute the cumulative number CR(t) of reported symptomatic infectious cases at
time t: CR(t) = χ1 exp(χ2 t) − χ3 . We find χ1 = 1.885, χ2 = 0.209, and χ3 = 2.054. The straight line in the
right side of Fig. 4 corresponds to t → ln(χ1 ) + χ2 t. We first estimate the value of χ3 and then use a least
square method (MSE) to evaluate χ1 and χ2 . We observe that the data for Tunisia provides a good fit for
CR(t) (explained variance score equal to 0.99).
From now on, we fix the fraction f = 0.6 of asymptomatic that become reported symptomatic infectious.
The average time during which asymptomatic infectious cases are symptomatic is equal to 1/ν = 1/7. The
average time symptomatic infectious have symptoms is equal to η = 1/7. The values 1/η = 7 days and
1/ν = 7 days are taken from information concerning earlier coronaviruses, and are used now by medical
authorities [18]. Thus, the value of t0 = 0.409 means that the starting time of the epidemic is 5 March. We
obtain R0 = 2.73, β = 2.76 10−8 , I0 = 3.8, and U0 = 0.3. We ran numerical simulations and compare them
with data. In the following, let take into account the fact that very strong isolation measures have been
imposed for all Tunisia since 25 March. Specifically, since March 12, families in Tunisia were required to
stay at home. To take into account such a public intervention, we assume that the transmission of COVID19 from infectious to susceptible individuals stopped after 25 March. Therefore, we consider the following
model: for t ≥ t0 , β(t) = β if t ∈ [t0 , 25] and β(t) = 0 for t > 25.

Fig. 4 In the left side figures, the dots correspond to t → CR(t), and in the right side figures, the dots correspond to
t → ln(CR(t)) − χ3 , where CR(t) is taken from the cumulated confirmed cases.

For a total population N equal to 11 818 619, we suppose that S0 = 11.81 106 is the susceptible
population to be infected by COVID-19. Without these strict control policies, the number of infected cases
certainly would have been different. Fig. 5 shows the number of t → CR(t), the unreported cases t → U (t),
and the data corresponding to the confirmed cumulated cases for Tunisia, without containment measures.

Fig. 5 We use χ1 = 1.885, χ2 = 0.209, χ3 = 2.054, t0 = 0.409 and S0 = 11.81 106 . Which gives R0 = 2.73, β = 2.76 10−8 ,
I0 = 3.8, and U0 = 0.3. In the right figure, the number of symptomatic reported cases if containment has not occurred can
be estimated to 472 457 i.e. 4% of the total population of Tunisisa. They would have been infected with more or less severe
symptoms.

The reproduction number R0 = 2.73 is quite high and the damage of COVID-19 came from the virulence
of the symptoms. In the literature, the value of R0 varies from 1.4 to 3.9 [17]. A more sophisticated model is
developed in [3] to examine the effects of an outbreak with control policies, it gives an R0 in the same range.
The measure of the effective reproduction number Rt under the current severe containment conditions in
Tunisia, using the Bayes’ theorem, gives Rt = 0.42 with CI 0.14 - 0.70 at May 11, 2020 (for an optimal
σ = 0.2 and η = 1/7). Fig. 6 shows that it leads to small outbreaks that eventually become extinguished.
To avoid overfitting on any one state, we choose the σ that maximizes P (k) over every state. To do this,
we add up all the log-likelihoods per state for each value of σ then choose the maximum: Fig. 7 indicates
the optimal result.
5 Discussion
The current emerging trend in mathematical epidemiology towards real-time predictive methods will allow
for a shift to more quantitative surveillance and prevention policy at the earliest stages of the epidemic.

Fig. 6 The variance σ is optimised on smoothed daily data. When σ = 0.20 and η = 1/7, Rt = 0.42 (mean CI 0.14-0.70).
These results are quite unstable and are highly dependent on the number of cases detected. The downward trend could
change at any time, especially as populations change their behaviour.

This will result in more consistent and expanded surveillance of emerging infectious diseases and improved
design of health interventions and logistical allocations as epidemics develop. An epidemic outbreak of a
new human coronavirus COVID-19 occurred in Tunisia. The unreported cases and the disease transmission rate are useful information. We estimate an actual number of infected cases in Tunisia based on the
18-day effect from infection to death and a mortality rate equal to 2%. We find that the number of cases
on May 11 is at least equal to 2 555 infected cases, the worst case is about 4% of the population. In fact,
according to the SEIR model with asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments, where the transmission
rate β = 2.76 10−8 , the total number of reported cases is 472 457 population near the turning point May
15. On May 11, the number of cases was 1032 infected, 45 dead, and a total population of 11 818 619. The
effective production rate puts Tunisia in the leading of its neighbours. It shows very good management of
the epidemic by Tunisia, especially on the number of deaths, Recovery, and Infected cases.
The estimation of R0 is achieved by fitting to the data (during the exponential period). This value may
differ due to acquired immunity and other factors. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 2.73 for a fixed
fraction f = 0.8 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate ν = 7. Effective reproduction
number Rt is given by matching the data, day by day, using Bayes’ theorem. On May 17, Rt is equal to
0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70) where η = 1/7 and σ = 0.2. The effective reproduction number Rt has reduced
to less than 1: public measures were taken, such as isolation, quarantine, and public closings, strict travel
restrictions, face mask for everyone, and reliable targeted testing. These measures exacerbate the spread
of this disease and mitigate the final size of the epidemic [21]. It is contained in Tunisia, provided that
quality of care and social distancing measures are in place. This protection may involve several factors, such
as genetic predispositions, the immune status of populations, the history of vaccinations, and in particular
what is known as training immunity, which is currently being discussed when BCG vaccination is involved
[15]. Compared to other countries, there is a certain level of protection that must be understood (in the
biological and immunological sense) to take advantage of it for better control of this disease or others that
will arise. Finding a vaccine, testing the miracle cure would reduce evolution.

In Tunisia, there is strict containment, but also contact tracing and respect for isolation: 24% of the cases
are foreign and the rest are domestic2 . The reopening of the borders without severe distancing measures
could have an impact and consequences for the epidemic outcome: Tunisia is heavily exposed from different
Chinese airports (Guangdong province and weakly to Zhejiang province) as the main source of entry risk [9].
Several infection waves are expected, and they could be spread over several years [16]. The mathematical
models outlined in this research could help anticipate the damage to the health care system that they
could cause promptly. Using models applied to hospital and death data, further work will be carried out
to estimate the impact of containment, as well as the current immunity of the population [19]. In terms of
public health implications, to stop the outbreak, at least 58-76% of transmissions should be blocked. And
we will no longer talk about this pandemic when 2/3 of the population will have been in contact with the
virus. In the meantime, confinement could become a toxic situation for our democracies: For societies like
Tunisia the ease with which entire sections of the population living in precarious conditions are endangered
[23]. The extraordinary real-time media coverage of the progression of this pandemic has weighed heavily
on the behaviour of all concerned, not only ordinary people but also politicians and even scientists [14]. The
mathematics of emergency medicine can yield very relevant results.
