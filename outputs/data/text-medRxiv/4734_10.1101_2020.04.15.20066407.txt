ABSTRACT
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused >1 million infections during January-March
2020. There is an urgent need for reliable antibody detection approaches to support
diagnosis, vaccine development, safe release of individuals from quarantine, and population
lock-down exit strategies. We set out to evaluate the performance of ELISA and lateral flow
immunoassay (LFIA) devices.
Methods: We tested plasma for COVID (SARS-CoV-2) IgM and IgG antibodies by ELISA
and using nine different LFIA devices. We used a panel of plasma samples from individuals
who have had confirmed COVID infection based on a PCR result (n=40), and pre-pandemic
negative control samples banked in the UK prior to December-2019 (n=142).
Results: ELISA detected IgM or IgG in 34/40 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID
infection (sensitivity 85%, 95%CI 70-94%), vs. 0/50 pre-pandemic controls (specificity 100%
[95%CI 93-100%]). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 COVID-positive individuals tested ≥10
days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89-100%). IgG titres rose during the 3
weeks post symptom onset and began to fall by 8 weeks, but remained above the detection
threshold. Point estimates for the sensitivity of LFIA devices ranged from 55-70% versus RTPCR and 65-85% versus ELISA, with specificity 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. Within
the limits of the study size, the performance of most LFIA devices was similar.
Conclusions: Currently available commercial LFIA devices do not perform sufficiently well
for individual patient applications. However, ELISA can be calibrated to be specific for
detecting and quantifying SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG and is highly sensitive for IgG from 10
days following first symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
The first cases of infection with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing Coronavirus
Infectious Disease (COVID) emerged in Wuhan, China on December 31st, 2019 [1]. Despite
intensive containment efforts, there was rapid international spread and three months later,
there had been over 1 million confirmed infections and 60,000 reported deaths [2].
Containment efforts have relied heavily on population quarantine (‘lock-down’) measures to
restrict movement and reduce individual contacts [3,4]. To develop public health strategies
for exit from lock-down, diagnostic testing urgently needs to be scaled-up, including both
mass screening and screening of specific high-risk groups (contacts of confirmed cases, and
healthcare workers and their families), in parallel with collecting data on recent and past
infection at individual and population levels [2].

Laboratory diagnosis of infection has mostly been based on real-time RT-PCR, typically
targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or nucleocapsid (N) genes
using swabs collected from the upper respiratory tract [5,6]. This requires specialist
equipment, skilled laboratory staff and PCR reagents, creating diagnostic delays. RT-PCR
from upper respiratory tract swabs may also be falsely negative due to quality or timing; viral
loads in upper respiratory tract secretions peak in the first week of symptoms [7], but may
have declined below the limit of detection in those presenting later [8]. In individuals who
have recovered, RT-PCR provides no information about prior exposure or immunity.

In contrast, assays that reliably detect antibody responses specific to SARS-CoV-2 could
contribute to diagnosis of acute infection (via rises in IgM and IgG levels) and to identifying
those infected with or without symptoms and recovered (via persisting IgG) [9]. Receptormediated viral entry to host cells occurs through interactions between the unique and highlyconserved viral spike (S) glycoprotein and the ACE2 cell receptor [10]. This S protein is the
primary target of specific neutralising antibodies, and current SARS-CoV-2 serology assays
therefore typically seek to identify these antibodies (Figure 1A-C). Rapid lateral flow
immunoassay (LFIA) devices provide a quick, point-of-care approach to antibody testing. A
sensitive and specific antibody assay could directly contribute to early identification and
isolation of cases, address unknowns regarding the extent of infection to inform
mathematical models and support individual or population-level release from lock-down.
Laboratory-based ELISA platforms have also been evaluated as an approach to detection
and quantification of SARS-CoV-antibodies [11].

However, before either laboratory assays or LFIA devices can be widely deployed, their
performance needs to be carefully evaluated (Figure 1D,E) [12]. We therefore compared a

novel laboratory-based ELISA assay with nine commercially-available LFIA devices using
samples from patients with RT-PCR-confirmed infection, and negative pre-pandemic
samples.

METHODS
Research Reporting
We have provided a STARD checklist (essential items for reporting diagnostic accuracy
studies); Table S1.

Samples
142 plasma samples designated seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 were collected from adults
(≥18 years) in the UK before December 2019 (Table S2, including demographic details) from
three ethically approved sources: healthy blood donors, organ donors on ICU following
cerebral injury and healthy volunteers from a vaccine study.

Forty plasma samples were collected from adults positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR from
an upper respiratory tract (nose/throat) swab tested in accredited laboratories (Table S2).
Acute (≤28 days from symptom onset) and convalescent samples (>28 days) were included
to optimise detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG respectively (Figure 1B). Acute
samples were collected from patients a median 10 (range 4-27) days from symptom onset
(n=16), and from recovering healthcare workers median 13 [range 8-19] days after first
symptoms; (n=6). Convalescent samples were collected from adults a median 48 [range 3162] days after symptom onset and/or date of positive throat swab (n=18). Further sample
details are provided in Supplementary Material.

Cases were classified following WHO criteria as critical (respiratory failure, septic shock,
and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure); severe (dyspnoea, respiratory frequency

≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates
>50% of the lung fields within 24-48 hours); or otherwise mild [13]. Among 22 acute cases, 9
were critical, 4 severe and 9 mild. All but one convalescent individual had mild disease; the
other was asymptomatic and screened during enhanced contact tracing.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
We developed a novel ELISA targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Recombinant SARSCoV-2 trimeric spike protein was constructed as described [14], using mammalian codon
optimized SARS2 Spike (1-1208, Genbank no. MN908947) with a GSAS substitution at the
furin cleavage site (aa 682-685) and double proline substitution at aa 986-987. The C4

terminal was followed by T4 fibritin motif, an HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrep
Tag and an 8-HisTag. The gene was cloned into a pHLsec and expressed in 293T cells. The
HIS trap HP column (cat no 17524701; Cytiva) was used to purify the recombinant S protein.

We used ELISA to detect antibodies to the S protein. MAXISORP immunoplates (442404;
NUNC) were coated with StrepMAB-Classic (2-1507-001;iba). Plates were blocked with 2%
skimmed milk in PBS for one hour and then incubated with 0.125ug of soluble trimeric
SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S protein or 2% skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline. After one
hour, plasma was added at 1:50 dilution, followed by ALP-conjugated anti-human IgG
(A9544; Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilution or ALP-conjugated anti-human IgM (A9794; Sigma) at
1:5,000 dilution. The reaction was developed by the addition of PNPP substrate and stopped
with 1.0 M NaOH. The absorbance was measured at 405nm after 90 minutes, and a final
optical density (OD) value was calculated by subtracting the background (skimmed milk)
from the test value. The ELISA assay takes 5-6 hours to perform with an experienced
operator being able to process up to five 96-well plates (480 samples including relevant
controls).

Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA)
We tested LFIA devices designed to detect IgM, IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
produced by nine manufacturers short-listed as a testing priority by the UK Government
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), based on appraisals of device provenance
and available performance data. Individual manufacturers did not approve release of devicelevel data, so device names are anonymised.

Testing was performed in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions for each
device. Typically, this involved adding 5-20µl of plasma to the sample well, and 80-100µl of
manufacturer’s buffer to an adjacent well, followed by incubation at room temperature for 1015 minutes. The result was based on the appearance of coloured bands, designated as
positive (control and test bands present), negative (control band only), or invalid (no band,
absent control band, or band in the wrong place) (Figure 1C).

We recorded results in real-time on a password-protected electronic database, using

We tested 90 samples using ELISA to quantify IgM and IgG antibody in plasma designated
SARS-CoV-2 negative (n=50) and positive (n=40). All positive samples were included and
an unstratified random sample of negative plasma from healthy blood donors (n=23) and
organ donors (n=27). We tested the nine different LFIA devices using between 39-165
individual plasma samples (8-23 and 31-142 samples designated SARS-CoV-2 positive and
negative, respectively, Table S3). Total numbers varied according to the number of devices
supplied to the DHSC; samples were otherwise selected at random.

Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted using R (version 3.6.3) and Stata (version 15.1), with additional
plots generated using GraphPad Prism (version 8.3.1). Binomial 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated for all proportions. The association between ELISA results and time
since symptom onset, severity, need for hospital admission and age was estimated using
multivariable linear regression, without variable selection. Non-linearity in relationships with
continuous factors was included via natural cubic splines. Differences between LFIA devices
were estimated using mixed effects logistic regression models, allowing for each device
being tested on overlapping sample sets. Differences between devices were compared with
Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-value thresholds. (Further details in Supplementary
Material.)

Ethical approval and role of the funding source
Our work was undertaken with ethical approval from the National Health Service Blood and
Transplant (NHSBT) ethics, providing donor consent for plasma use; NIHR Biobank REC
agreement (REC 13/NW/0017; IRAS 87824); International Severe Acute Respiratory and
Emerging Infection Consortium (‘ISARIC’) approval by the South Central (Oxford C)
Research Ethics Committee in England (Ref: 13/SC/0149), and Scotland A Research Ethics
Committee in Scotland (Ref: 20/SS/0028). The UK Government DHSC selected the lateral
flow devices for testing as described above. Otherwise, the funders had no role in study
design or in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. Authors from DHSC
contributed to writing of the report and in the decision to submit the paper for publication.

RESULTS
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody by ELISA
Forty positive (RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) and 50 designated negative (prepandemic) plasma samples were tested by ELISA to characterise antibody profiles. Negative
samples had median optical density (OD) for IgM of -0.0001 (arbitrary units) (range -0.14 to
0.06) and for IgG -0.01 (range -0.38 to 0.26). The median IgM reading in 40 positive samples

was 0.18 (range -0.008 to 1.13; Kruskal-Wallis p<0.001 vs. negative) and IgG median 3.0
(range -0.2 to 3.5; p<0.001).

As safe individual release from lock-down is a major application for serological testing, we
chose OD thresholds that maintained 100% specificity (95%CI 93-100%), while maximising
sensitivity. Using thresholds of 0.07 for IgM and 0.4 for IgG (3 and 5 standard deviations
above the negative mean respectively; Figure 2A,B), the IgG assay had 85% sensitivity
(95%CI 70-94%; 34/40) vs. RT-PCR diagnosis. All six false-negatives were from samples
taken within 9 days of symptom onset (Figure 2D). IgG levels were detected in 31/31 RTPCR-positive individuals tested ≥10 days after symptom onset (sensitivity 100%, 95%CI 89100%). The IgM assay sensitivity was lower at 70% (95%CI 53-83%; 28/40). All IgG falsenegatives were IgM-negative. No patient was IgM-positive and IgG-negative.

Considering the relationship between IgM and IgG titres and time since symptom onset
(Figures 2C,D), univariable regression models showed IgG antibody titres rising over the first
3 weeks from symptom onset. The lower bound of the pointwise 95%CI for the mean
expected titre crosses our OD threshold between days 6-7 (Figure 2D). However, given
sampling variation, test performance is likely to be optimal from several days later. IgG titres
fell during the second month after symptom onset but remained above the OD threshold. No
temporal association was observed between IgM titres and time since symptom onset
(Figure 2C). There was no evidence that SARS-2-CoV severity, need for hospital admission
or patient age were associated with IgG or IgM titres in multivariable models (p>0.1, Table
S4).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by LFIA vs. RT-PCR
We first considered performance of the nine different LFIA devices using RT-PCR-confirmed
cases as the reference standard (Table 1A, Figure S1) and considering any LFIA positive
result (IgM, IgG or both) as positive. The LFIA devices achieved sensitivity ranging from 55%
(95%CI 36-72%) to 70% (51-84%) and specificity from 95% (95%CI 86-99%) to 100% (94100%). There was no evidence of differences between the devices in sensitivity (p≥0.015, cf.
Benjamini-Hochberg p=0.0014 threshold) or specificity (p≥0.19 for all devices with at least
one false-positive test). Restricting to 31 samples collected ≥10 days post symptom-onset
(all ELISA IgG-positive), LFIA sensitivity ranged from 61% (95%CI 39-80%) to 88% (6897%) (Table S5).

We also considered performance relative to ELISA (Table S6, Figure S1), because the LFIA
devices target the same antibodies. We considered patients positive by this alternative
standard if their IgG OD reading exceeded the threshold above (since no samples were IgMpositive, IgG-negative). Sensitivity of antibody detection by LFIA ranged from 65% (95%CI
46-80%) to 85% (66-96%) and specificity from 93% (95%CI 83-98%) to 100% (94-100%);
however, the device with the highest sensitivity had one of the lowest specificities (Figure
S1). There was no evidence of differences in sensitivity (p≥0.010, cf. p=0.0014 threshold) or
specificity between devices (p≥0.19).
Of 50 designated negative samples tested by both ELISA and the nine different LFIA
devices, nine separate samples generated at least one false-positive, on seven different
LFIA devices (Figure 3). Four samples generating false-positive results did so on more than
one LFIA device, despite the absence of quantifiable IgM or IgG on ELISA, potentially
suggesting a specific attribute of the sample causing a cross-reaction on certain LFIA
platforms.

Of the 22 RT-PCR-positive samples collected in the acute setting, six fell below the ELISA
detection threshold for IgM or IgG; two of these six were positive on LFIA testing, each on
one (different) device. Of the remaining 16 acute samples (all ELISA IgG-positive), only nine
were consistently positive across all nine LFIA devices. Due to limited availability of LFIA
devices, fewer tests were performed on the 18 convalescent samples with available ELISA
data, all with quantifiable IgG (Figure 2B;3A). Two had no antibody detected on any LFIA
device, and only eight were consistently positive across all LFIA devices tested (between 1
and 9 devices tested per sample).

DISCUSSION
We here present the performance characteristics of a novel ELISA and nine selected LFIA
devices for detecting SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG. Among 40 RT-PCR-confirmed positive
patients, 85% had IgG detected by ELISA, including 100% patients tested ≥10 days after
symptom onset. A panel of LFIA devices had sensitivity between 55 and 70% against the
reference-standard RT-PCR, or 65-85% against ELISA, with specificity of 95-100% and 93100%, respectively. These estimates come with wide confidence intervals due to constraints
on the number of devices made available. Comparable results have been obtained through a
similar appraisal undertaken independently, in which specificity ranged from 84%-100.0%,
and the proportion of specimens testing positive increased over time from symptom onset,
with >80% sensitivity achieved by some LFIA devices at later time points [15]. Our study,
and these parallel data from another centre [15], provide a benchmark against which to

assess the performance of future antibody testing platforms, with the aim of guiding
decisions about deploying antibody testing and informing the design of second-generation
assays.

LFIA devices are cheap to manufacture, store and distribute, and could be used as a pointof-care test, offering an appealing approach to diagnostics and evaluating exposure. A
positive antibody test is currently regarded as a probable surrogate for immunity to
reinfection. Secure confirmation of antibody status would therefore reduce anxiety, provide
confidence to allow individuals to relax social distancing measures, and guide policy-makers
in the staged release of population lock-down, potentially in tandem with digital approaches
to contact tracing [16]. As a diagnostic tool, serology may have a role in combination with
RT-PCR testing to improve sensitivity, particularly of cases presenting some time after
symptom onset [17,18]. Reproducible methods to detect and quantify vaccine-mediated
antibodies are also crucial as COVID vaccines enter clinical trials.

Appropriate thresholds for sensitivity and specificity depend on the primary purpose of the
test. For diagnosis in symptomatic patients, high sensitivity is required (generally ≥90%).
Specificity is less critical as some false-positives could be tolerated (provided other potential
diagnoses are considered, and accepting that over-diagnosis causes unnecessary
quarantine or hospital admission). However, if antibody tests were deployed as an individuallevel approach to inform release from quarantine, then high specificity is essential, as falsepositive results return non-immune individuals to risk of exposure. For this reason, the UK
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has set a minimum 98% specificity
threshold for LFIAs [19].

Appraisal of test performance should also consider the influence of population prevalence,
acknowledging that this changes over time, geography and within different population
groups. The potential risk of a test providing false reassurance and release from lock-down
of non-immune individuals can be considered as the proportion of all positive tests that are
wrong. Based on the working ‘best case’ scenario of a LFIA test with 70% sensitivity and
98% specificity, the proportion of positive tests that are wrong is 35% at 5% population
seroprevalence (19 false-positives/1000 tested), 10% at 20% seroprevalence (16 falsepositives/1000) and 3% at 50% seroprevalence (10 false-positives/1000) (Figure 4).

More data are needed to investigate antibody-positivity as a correlate of protective immunity.
Indeed pre-existing IgG could enhance disease in some situations [20], with animal data

demonstrating that SARS-CoV anti-spike IgG contributes to a proinflammatory response
associated with lung injury in macaques [21].

Our study, and another undertaken independently in parallel [11], demonstrates accurate
performance of ELISA targeting anti-spike protein antibodies. Additionally, our ELISA results
are supported by context regarding disease severity and the time of sampling relative to
symptom onset. Our data on the kinetics of antibody responses build upon studies of
hospitalised patients in China reporting a median 11 days to seroconversion for total
antibody, with IgM and IgG seroconversion at days 12 and 14 respectively [17], and others
that report 100% IgG positivity by 15-19 days [18] [22]. Our ELISA data show IgG titres rose
over the first 3 weeks of infection and that IgM testing identified no additional cases.
Methods to enhance sensitivity, especially shortly after symptom onset, could consider
different sample types (e.g. saliva), different antibody classes (e.g. IgA) [23], T-cell assays or
antigen detection [24]. In contrast to others [18,25-27], we did not find evidence of an
association between disease severity and antibody titres. We observed several LFIA false
positives, which may have potentially resulted from cross-reactivity of non-specific antibodies
(e.g. reflecting past exposure to other seasonal coronavirus infections).
The main study limitation is that numbers tested were too small to provide tight confidence
intervals around performance estimates for any specific LFIA device. Expanding testing
across diverse populations would increase certainty, but given the broadly comparable
performance of different assays, the cost and manpower to test large numbers may not be
justifiable. Demonstrating high specificity is particularly challenging; for example, if the true
underlying value was 98%, 1000 negative controls would be required to estimate the
specificity of an assay to +/-1% with approximately 90% power. Full assessment should also
include a range of geographical locations and ethnic groups, children, and those with
immunological disease including autoimmune conditions and immunosuppression.

In summary, antibody testing is a crucial component of measures that may be required to
inform release from lockdown. Our findings suggest that while current LFIA devices may
provide some information for population-level surveys, their performance is inadequate for
most individual patient applications. The ELISA we describe is currently being optimised and
adapted to run on a high-throughput platform and provides promise for the development of
reliable approaches to antibody detection that can support decision making for clinicians, the
public health community, policy-makers and industry.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. Cartoon to illustrate the generation of IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS
nCoV-2 and detection of antibodies by a lateral flow device. (A) In vivo generation of
antibodies to the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. (B) Projected change in titres of
specific IgM and IgG over time following infection, with arrows indicating typical time frames
for collection of acute and convalescent samples. (C) Ex vivo detection of IgG and/or IgM
using a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA): S= sample well, T=test antibody; C=control.
Diagram shows a positive sample on the left, with positive lines at both C and T, and a
negative test on the right with a line present only at C. Any other combination of lines
renders the test invalid. Some devices have two test lines, for separate detection of antiSARS-nCoV-2-IgG and -IgM. (D) Outcomes of testing negative and positive plasma using
LFIA. (E) Calculation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of a
test. Image created with BioRender.com; exported under a paid subscription.

Figure 2: Results of testing 90 plasma samples for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG by
Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). (A) IgM readings for SARS-CoV-2 prepandemic plasma (designated negatives, shown in blue, n=50), and RT-PCR confirmed
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (designated positives, shown in orange, n=40; divided into
acute cases, n=22, and convalescent cases, n=18. Threshold of OD = 0.07 discriminates
accurately between negative controls and convalescent sera. (B) IgG data shown for the
same subgroups described for panel A. A threshold of OD = 0.4 discriminates between
designated negatives and positives. (C) IgM OD values plotted against the time post
symptoms at which plasma was obtained. The line shows the mean OD value expected from
a spline-based linear regression model, the ribbon indicates the pointwise 95% confidence
interval. (D) IgG OD values plotted against the time post symptoms at which plasma was
obtained. Coloured dots in panels C and D indicate disease severity. OD = optical density.

Figure 3: Comparison between ELISA and LFIA for SARS-CoV-2 designated negative
and positive plasma. Panel A shows quantitative optical density (OD) readout from ELISA
for IgG for designated negative plasma (n=50) and from individuals with RT-PCR confirmed
infection (n=40, divided into acute and convalescent plasma). IgM results are shown in
Figure S2 in the Supplementary Materials. Panel B shows results from LFIA produced by
nine manufacturers. Any positive test for IgG, IgM, both or total antibody is shown as
positive, please see Figure S2 for more detailed breakdown. Grey blocks indicate missing
data as a result of insufficient devices to test all samples and one assay on one device with

an invalid result. Samples in both panels are ranked from left to right by quantitation of IgG
(as indicated in panel A).

Figure 4: Influence of population prevalence of seropositivity on assay performance.
Scenarios with population prevalence of 5%, 20% and 50% are shown within each panel.
Panel A shows the proportion of all positive tests that are wrong (1-positive predictive value),
which would lead to false release from lock-down of non-immune individuals, for varying test
sensitivity (x-axis) and 1-specificity (line colour). Panel B shows the proportion of negative
tests that are wrong, panel C the absolute number of false positive tests per 1000 tests and
panel D the absolute number of false negative tests per 1000 tests.
