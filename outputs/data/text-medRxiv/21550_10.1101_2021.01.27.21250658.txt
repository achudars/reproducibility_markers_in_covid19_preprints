Abstract
We systematically investigated an ongoing debate about the possible correlation
between SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) epidemiological outcomes and solar exposure in
European countries, in the period of March – August 2020. For each country, we
correlated its mortality data with solar insolation (watt/square metre) and objective sky
cloudiness (as cloud fraction) derived from satellite weather data. We found a positive
correlation between the monthly mortality rate and the overall cloudiness in that month
(Pearson's r(35)=.779, P<.001; linear model fitting the data, adjusted R2 =0.59). In
Europe, in colder months, approximately 34% to 58% of the variance in COVID-19
mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky, except in
August in which only ~15% of the variance was explained. The data show a low,
negative correlation between the mortality rate with the overall insolation received by
the country area in that entire month (Pearson's r(35)=-0.622, P<.001). Additionally,
we did not find any statistically significant correlation between the mortality and the
latitude of the countries when the “latitude of a country” was precisely defined as the
average landmass location (country centroid). The unexpected correlation found between
cloudiness and mortality could perhaps be explained by the following: 1) heavy
cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival; 2)
reduced evaporation rate; 3) moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and
mortality; and 4) large-scale behavioural changes due to cloudiness (which perhaps
drives people to spend more time indoors and thus facilitates indoor contamination).

Introduction
This study explores the influence of previously ignored climatological factors (objective
cloudiness and solar irradiation) on SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) mortality in Europe.
The factors that might influence the spread and impact of COVID-19 have recently been
extensively discussed in the media and in research articles. Coronaviruses spread in the
population due to a combination of medical, biological and socio-economic factors. It has also
been suggested that latitude [1,2] and climate (temperature, humidity [3,4]) significantly
contribute to COVID-19 spread.
A copious amount of (mainly local) studies (some not yet peer-reviewed) on climatic influence
on COVID-19 has been released, with mixed or contradictory results. The World
Meteorological Organization even hosted an international virtual symposium on the issue to
deal with these uncertainties (“Climatological, Meteorological and Environmental factors on
COVID-19 pandemic”, 4-6 August 2020).
Initially, (March – April 2020), the transmission of COVID-19 seemed to be associated with
the 30- to 50-degree North longitude corridor and weather patterns and low specific and
absolute humidity [2]; however this could just as plausibly reflect trade and human movement
patterns in the Northern hemisphere. Late in the spring of 2020, tropical and subtropical
countries began to see an increase of pandemic transmission, and the latitude dependency thus
appears to be unsure at this point.
It has also been previously noted that COVID-19 had a higher impact in countries where
epidemiological data had shown a degree of vitamin D deficiency in the population [1]. Vitamin
D has a wide range of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and
it thus seems (presumably) protective. In vivo vitamin D synthesis is photochemically
dependent in humans, and its concentration levels drop without sufficient sunlight exposure. As
the latitude increases, the amount of locally received sunlight generally decreases. These two
facts were combined by other researchers in a range of compelling clinical hypotheses linking
susceptibility to COVID-19 to vitamin D and indirectly to lack of sunlight exposure or
increased latitude (see for example [5] or [6] for a more thorough perspective on these issues
and [7] for a biochemical study).
In sharp contrast to the above hypotheses, other biochemical studies have not to found a
correlation between vitamin D and COVID-19 epidemiological data (see [8] or [9]). These
studies concluded that other unknown factors might be at play.
We tried to address these contradictions from an analytical, biophysical point of view: the
amount of UV radiation that reaches the ground (and is thus presumably protective) is a
fraction of total sunlight (which also contains visible light and infrared radiation). The total
sunlight (known also as “solar insolation” or “solar irradiance at ground level”) is defined as
the flux of solar radiation per unit of horizontal area for a given location. It depends on several
factors: primarily on solar zenith angle (which depends on latitude), secondarily on
atmospheric composition (via absorption and scattering), and thirdly on seasonal change (due
to the Earth's axial tilt). These are well known and researched topics; see for example [10] for
an extensive review. Solar irradiance is one of the main factors that determine the temperature

at ground level (with an almost linear dependence [11]), along with humidity (by inducing
water evaporation and soil dryness) and the climate in general [12]). Solar irradiance is
expressed in watts/square metre.
Solar irradiance at ground level is heavily influenced by atmospheric composition, primarily by
clouds [13] and secondarily by other factors such as dust, pollutants, and humidity [14]. Clouds
exert a complex influence: by reflection of the sunlight (back into space) they reduce the
amount of total energy that reaches the earth but by scattering they can counterintuitively
direct some of the energy back to land, especially in the UV portion of the spectrum, thus
modulating the biologically effective radiation dose received by living things [15].
In this study, we present detailed research on the direct influence on COVID-19 mortality in
European countries of the above-discussed factors: a) sky cloudiness, b) solar irradiance and c)
latitude. Our results show that there is a sizeable influence due to cloudiness, a smaller
influence due to absolute amount of sunlight, and basically no influence due to latitude.

Methods
1. Datasets
Epidemiological data
Different epidemiological variables about COVID-19 epidemics are collected and reported
around the world. We used the “Coronavirus update”, a publicly available epidemiological
database summarized by Worldometers [16]; monthly data snapshots of it were retrieved from
the Internet Archive Organization [17]. From this database we extracted the mortality, defined
as the number of deaths per 1 million inhabitants in a given country in a particular month.
There are two issues with this approach that might impact our study. First, there are legal and
practical differences among countries regarding death recording and reporting [18]. The
COVID-19 database we used records the deaths as reported by local authorities; we could not
quantitatively assess the differences between the countries, which could impact comparison of
different countries. Second, the time lag between the actual death and the reported time could
be different for each case; the monthly intervals analysed probably average most of the
differences.
Atmospheric cloudiness data
Cloudiness (also known as cloud fraction, cloud cover, cloud amount or sky cover) refers to the
fraction of the sky obscured by clouds (in a particular location). It can be reported in various
units. In this study, we used the cloud fraction (as tenths of the entire sky); 0.0 thus indicates
a clear sky and 1.0 (or 10/10) indicates a completely covered sky.
We used a publicly available dataset of
Terra and Aqua satellites using the
Spectroradiometer) [19]. This dataset
averaged daily, weekly and monthly for
averaged values.

MODIS instrument (Moderate Resolution Imaging

the entire globe; for this study we chose the monthly

In this dataset the entire Earth surface is divided into a rectangular grid. Each rectangle of the
grid contains the average cloud fraction of the sky covering that area. The data are available at
different resolutions (sizes of the rectangular grid that covers the Earth). We chose a fairly
detailed resolution of the grid, 0.25° latitude x 0.25° longitude. We ensured that the other
geographical datasets that we used in this study matched the same spatial resolution.
Solar data
The average solar insolation (also known as solar irradiance, solar exposure, incoming sunlight)
in watts/square metre at the Earth's surface was used in this study. We used a publicly
available dataset inferred from measurements taken by Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy
System (CERES) instrument flying aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites [20]. We used the
same temporal and spatial sampling as presented above, i.e., monthly averaged values over a
0.25° latitude x 0.25° longitude grid.
Geographical data
For a single point on the Earth, the geographical coordinates are straightforward (latitude and
longitude). However, for a country (or large region) the coordinates can be represented in
several distinct ways, each with pros and cons, such as the location of the capital city, the
location of the most populated city, the average between the most extreme points of the
country,and the country centroid, among others.
As the “latitude of a country” measure, we used the country centroid. A centroid (also known
as the centre of gravity or centre of mass) is the arithmetic mean of the positions of all the
points in a geometrical object; for irregular objects, it is closest to the centre of the biggest
part of the object (it is less influenced by very thin or heavily scattered boundaries). We chose
this measure because several countries have highly irregular geometrical boundaries or long
thin peninsulas or numerous islands (i.e., Greece, Norway, etc.); the country centroid is located
closer to the widest area of the mainland. We used a standard database of countries centroids
published by Google Maps developers [21].
As the “country boundary” measure we chose to use a simplified representation of the country
border, the country bounding box, which is a rectangle on the surface of the Earth with North
and South edges corresponding to the limiting (max and min) latitudes of the country and
West and East edges corresponding to the limiting longitudes. We used a database of bounding
boxes of all countries published by the Center of Humanitarian Data [22].
We are aware that the use of the country bounding box simplification can induce a degree of
imprecision (smoothing) or overlapping errors. To minimize these errors, we carefully curated
the bounding box coordinates to exclude non-mainland portions. We did this because we
wanted to restrict the analysis to the land portion of Europe (for example, overseas remote
islands such as Svalbard would include almost 600 sq km of Arctic Ocean surface in Norway's
geographical definition). We checked this by comparing the centroid location of each country
with the average geometric centre of its bounding box, making sure that the error was less than
1 degree of longitude or latitude.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were as follows: a) all countries on the European continent; b) availability
of epidemiological and geographical (cloudiness, insolation) data.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: a) population<0.5 million and b) a geographical
bounding box of the country smaller than 0.25° latitude x 0.25° longitude. We used these
criteria because European micro-states (Monaco, Vatican, San Marino, etc.) were too small to
be properly sampled from the available resolution of geospatial data (insolation, cloudiness).
Russia was also excluded from analysis because the COVID-19 epidemiological data from the
country was available only in an aggregate form (i.e., no data were available detailing the
epidemiology in European and Asian parts of Russia).
In this way we obtained a list of 37 European countries (listed alphabetically): Albania,
Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway,
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United
Kingdom (UK) and Ukraine.
For each of these countries and for each month in the studied interval (March – August 2020),
we included in the analysis the following variables: COVID-19 mortality (deaths per 1 million
population), insolation averaged for 1 month across the country (measured in Watt/m2), the
cloud fraction averaged for 1 month across the country (expressed as a fraction between 0.0 …
1.0) and the latitude of the countries. The aggregated results for each country are presented in
the Supplementary materials, Figures S.1, S.2 and S.3)

2. Software used
We performed basic epidemiological data gathering in tabular sheets (Excel/LibreOffice Calc).
We performed data analysis and visualization in R version 4.0.2 [23], with packages tidyverse
[24], ggplot [25], stargazer [26]; geospatial data was analysed with raster [27].

3. Calculation
Most of the European countries reported the first deaths in March 2020 (see Supplementary
material, Figure S.1), and we used this month as the starting point for our analysis.
We employed multiple linear regression models with mortality as the response (it is log10
transformed in all the following analyses and figures). As predictor variables we used cloud
fraction and solar insolation, both averaged (for the March – August interval). For each one of
the reported models we checked their validity by analysing the normality of the residuals as
follows: normal Q-Q plot, presence of outliers, and homogeneity of the variance of residuals (we
assumed homoscedasticity if the result of the studentized Breusch-Pagan test was bigger than
0.05). We attempted a brief time-series analysis of the factors; we checked the distribution of
the data in time and the autocorrelation of the disturbances with a Durbin-Watson test.

Results
1. Overall Mortality vs. Cloudiness

Figure 1. Overall correlation between mortality and cloudiness.
The data points are the averaged values for each one of the European countries included
in the study during March – August 2020. Cloudiness is expressed as the cloud fraction,
ranging between 0.0 (completely sunny sky) and 1.0 (clouds completely obscure the sun).

For each country, in the interval March – August 2020, we averaged the monthly cloudiness
and the monthly mortality rate, and we built a linear model (Figure 1). It shows a modest but
statistically significant correlation between the average mortality rate and the average sky
cloudiness (Pearson's r(35)=.779, P<.001).
The linear model that fits the data shown in Figure one is presented in Table 1. In continental
Europe, from the beginning of the epidemic, approximately 59% of the variance in COVID-19
mortality/million appears to be predicted by the cloudiness fraction of the sky. The model
passes the quality criteria listed in the Calculation section, and the residuals of the model

appear to be homoscedastic, Breusch-Pagan test P-value=0.893).

2. Overall Mortality vs. Insolation

Figure 2. Overall correlation between averaged mortality and averaged insolation (solar irradiance).
The data points are the averaged values for all European countries included in the study during
March – July 2020. The dashed line represents the apparently good-fitting linear model, although this
model is not valid upon close inspection (see text). We included it as a guide for the eye.

The dataset shows a low, negative correlation between the mortality rate (evaluated at the end
of a month) and the overall insolation received by the country area in that entire month
(Pearson's r(35)=-0.622, P<.001). Note that some of the data points are missing (for the
month of August 2020 the solar irradiance data were not yet available at the time of writing).
The linear model that fit this dataset explains only approximately 37% of the variance of the
data; the regression model did not hold after a close inspection of the distribution of residuals.
It passed the Breusch-Pagan test (P=0.11), but the analysis of the residuals vs. leverage

revealed some issues with the model: Portugal is a high leverage point (with a high Cook's
distance); its exclusion from the analysis would significantly change the model. Quantilequantile (Q-Q) plot analysis indicates that both Portugal and Belgium have more extreme
values that would be expected from the rest of the data points. We plotted the regression line
in Figure 2 for the completeness of the graphic. This seems to strongly suggest that there are
some highly divergent confounding factors in this regression model of mortality vs. insolation.
As we noted in the Introduction, it is well known that the solar irradiance at the ground level
is primarily influenced by clouds and secondarily by other factors. We verified that this fact is
indeed true in the analysed dataset: the insolation vs. cloud fraction has Pearson's r(183)=0.804, P<.001, and the adjusted R2=0.654, for all the raw data points. Similar results were
obtained if we analysed the averaged data for each country over the March–August interval:
Pearson's r(35)=-0.838, P<0.001, adjusted R2=0.695. The other confounding factors that
influenced the variation are unknown, and we tried to address some of the possibilities in the
Discussion section. A combined model of mortality vs. cloudiness and insolation (with or
without interaction) did not significantly change the above results.

3. Time-series analysis
We also wanted to make sure that the above results were not the result of chronological
influence over the chosen factors. As a preliminary check, we verified the independent variation
in time of these variables; these are reported in Supplementary material, Figures S.4 – S.6. The
overall mortality rate (Figure S.4) increases continuously. The cloudiness seem to be randomly
distributed with no discernible pattern in the 6-month interval analysed (Figure S.5); this is
expected because the seasonal temporal variability in the cloud cover is usually ~30%, with
bigger differences between extreme seasons [28]. The average solar insolation in European
countries month-by-month (Figure S.6) follows the expected sinusoidal pattern due to seasonal
changes [10].
After these checks we verified the correlations of these factors (cloud fraction, insolation) with
mortality at monthly intervals (Figure 3).

For the dataset analysed we found no consistent correlation between the insolation and
mortality in the month-by-month analysis. The Pearson's r values were negative (with the
exception of March) but the models did not pass the stringent criteria defined in the
Calculation section.

4. Mortality vs. Latitude

No correlation found; the data points are the averaged mortality values for all European
countries included in the study during March – August 2020.

The dataset (Figure 4) shows no correlation between the mortality rate and the latitude of the
European countries for the entire interval studied (Pearson's r(35)=.06, P=0.72). We used the
"country centroid" [21] latitude as the single number that defined the latitude of a country (as
discussed in the Methods section).

Discussion
Contrary to some previously reported results (for example [2,5]) we did not find a correlation
between latitude and mortality in the studied European countries. This result is possibly
because we used the rather stringent centroid definition of the coordinates of countries, rather
than a broad geographical area [2] or the coordinates of the capitals [1].
We also found a very low correlation (and negative) between the measured amount of sunlight
and mortality that was not consistent month-by-month. This result tends to support the
previously published idea that a greater amount of sunlight might have some beneficial effects
[29]. However the lack of month-by-month consistency and the low quality of the regression
model suggests that the absolute amount of sunlight does not seem to have an impact on
mortality.
Together, these two results seem to suggest that the mortality-vitamin D hypothesis (lower
sunlight at higher latitudes leads to lower vitamin D levels, which leads to higher mortality) is
perhaps incomplete. As a note of interest, other studies found that serum vitamin D correlates
stronger with skin tone than with latitude (higher melanin content effectively prevents UV
photons from initiating synthesis); see for example Åkeson et al. [30] for a study of vitamin D
variation at a single latitude (Sweeden), Martin et al. [31] for a general meta-analysis, and a
review of vitamin D and COVID-19 [32].
Unexpectedly, we found that the cloudiness in a month (the monthly averaged cloud fraction)
has the strongest positive correlation with COVID-19 mortality. This has been, to the best of
our knowledge, unreported up to now.
We suggest the following possible explanations for this unexpected finding:
1) Heavy cloudiness is linked with colder outdoor surfaces, which might aid virus survival
A higher cloud cover quickly cools down the outdoor surfaces, especially at lower latitudes [33].
Colder surfaces facilitate the survival of SARS-Cov-2 [34]. As observed by Heneghan &
Jefferson [35], the risk of incidence was higher in days with lower temperature (citing a study
of a previous SARS epidemic by Lin et al, 2005 that observed an 18-fold increase in incidence
in lower temperature days than in higher temperature days [36]); the plausible increase in
actual incidence might thus lead to an increased number of deaths. As an easy-to-spot example
for this unexpected finding, in the spring of 2020 Spain was cloudier than Norway (see
Supplementary Material, Figures S.2 and S.1 for cloudiness and mortality charts).
2) Reduced evaporation rate
We speculate that in addition to lowering temperature, a cloudy sky may drive down the
evaporation rate (via two mechanisms: lower solar energy reaching the ground and perhaps by
increasing the relative air humidity). This might favour the stabilization of the infectious
droplets and enhance viral propagation (as suggested by Sajadi [2]). This seems to be
supported by the evidence that coronaviruses survive better in colder environments but
contradicts the finding that higher humidity impairs the transmission [3]. This is highly
speculative because in this dataset we could not check for actual humidity in the atmosphere
(and to further complicate the interaction, we note that rainy clouds do increase the humidity).

3) Moderate pollution may be linked to both cloudiness and mortality
Even moderate pollution in the atmosphere helps clouds form [37], and it was also previously
found that airborne pollution was linked to worse outcomes for the COVID-19 patients (see for
example [38] for documented pollution effects in Italy; other similar studies are currently under
review). Therefore, it might be that cloudiness data could be a proxy for pollution data (which
is not available for all countries).
4) Behavioural changes due to cloudiness
We suggest that an additional simple hypothesis is that overly cloudy weather (a higher cloud
fraction) might change behavioural choices at large scale, nudging people to spend more time
indoors rather than outdoors. It was suggested that spending more time in closed environments
facilitates the secondary transmission of COVID-19, thus driving up the rate of infections
(Nishiura et al., 2020, under review). This explanation seems to be consistent with the
observation that living in overcrowded conditions is associated with poorer outcomes [8] and
with the observation that some other environmental factors are at play in addition to the lack
of sun-induced vitamin D synthesis [9].
The results show a difference in the relationships of COVID-19 deaths to cloud fraction versus
solar radiation. This could perhaps be explained by a higher net amount of infrared radiation
that reaches the ground surface when higher clouds are present compared with the presence of
lower clouds [39,40] (we thank an anonymous reviewer for this insight). Our study could not
distinguish between the types of clouds constituting the cloud fraction.
We are aware that this study has limitations: we did not investigate the precipitation rate,
wind velocity, air pressure, air pollution and density (these are factors that are under scrutiny
for their possible impact on COVID-19 epidemiology). We acknowledge that our observational
retrospective study is limited: temporal autocorrelation cannot be excluded over longer periods
of time. The possibility of spatial autocorrelation was not researched by this study. Cloudiness
might be a confounding factor in the previous studies that related vitamin D synthesis to
latitude and sunlight. The authors support the current guidelines that in patients with vitamin
D deficiency this should be treated irrespective of any link with respiratory infections. We are
also aware that different countries took different governmental responses to the COVID-19
crisis, which has lead to different epidemiological outcomes. Last, we urge the reader not to
extrapolate these results because we only investigated these variables in 37 European countries,
not in the entire world. Additionally, this investigation was time-limited for 6 months; the story
is developing, and we wait to see what it is the impact of an entire seasonal cycle. We plan to
update the analysis as new data become available (see Data Availability Statements below). We
hope that these results will bring a warning about the possible impact of extended cloudiness
on COVID-19 transmission.

Conclusions
The data from the European continent in the spring-summer of 2020 suggest that the
atmospheric cloudiness over a longer period (i.e., a month) seems to explain about a third of
the variance of coronavirus (COVID-19) mortality; a higher degree of sky cloudiness in a
month seems to be correlated with an increased mortality rate in that month. This knowledge

suggest increased vigilance and increased frequency of sanitation of outdoor high-risk surfaces
during cloudy weather.
