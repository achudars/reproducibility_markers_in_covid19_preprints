ABSTRACT
Background Children are an important population to test for COVID-19 infection,
particularly because they may shed the virus without displaying symptoms. Testing
children for COVID-19 via sensitive molecular methods is important, although collecting
nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens can be challenging. A less invasive mode of
specimen collection that yields test results comparable to those from NP specimens
would be beneficial to simplify sample collection.
Methods

To demonstrate that saliva is a suitable specimen for collection from

children, the clinical usability/acceptability and the analytic performance of saliva were
compared to NP specimens suspended in viral transport medium. Four different FDA
EUA-approved real-time RT-PCR assays and one EUA approved saliva collection
device were investigated.
Results

The study population included 526 patients between the ages of 3 and 61

years, 461 (88%) were <18 years, 425 were asymptomatic (81.1%), 92 were
symptomatic (17.6%). Saliva mixed with saliva stabilizing buffer was found to yield
comparable sensitivity to NP specimens when tested on the AllPlex SARS-CoV-2
molecular test (Seegene Inc). The analytic sensitivity of the AllPlex assay during testing
of spiked saliva mixed with SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer was found to be 250 genomic
copies/mL.
Conclusions

Of the four FDA EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays studied, we

found the AllPlex assay to be best suited for testing saliva specimens collected from
children 5 years of age or older. The sensitivity of viral detection was equivalent to NP
specimens when saliva specimens were mixed with the saliva stabilizer.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the global population. Virtually
every populated region of the world, with the sole exception of Antarctica, is
experiencing ongoing infections.1 While individuals of all age groups have been shown
susceptible to infection, children are less likely than adults to experience severe
infections.2,3 Children rarely may progress to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a newly described post-infectious condition that occurs in
children 2 – 4 weeks after exposure to COVID-19.4 Children may also be
asymptomatically infected.5 Testing children for COVID-19 via molecular methods is
important because low levels of virus may be present, although collecting
nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens is challenging in children, especially for repeated
testing which may be used in “back to school” initiatives. To identify childhood vectors
of infection and diagnose children with symptoms of the disease, an easier mode of
collecting specimens would be beneficial.
The use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus in
the clinical laboratory has not been straightforward. Saliva is not a typical sample type
used in diagnostic clinical testing; it may have interferences and viscosity levels that
makes pipet manipulation challenging. A recently published letter to the editor
described an unsuccessful attempt to obtain comparably sensitive polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) results from saliva and simultaneously collected NP specimens from
children.6 The study involved testing unprocessed saliva using a laboratory-developed
real time, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the SARSCoV-2 E gene. The authors concluded that saliva is not a useful specimen for

diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in children. In contrast, Wyllie et al followed a similar
study design in testing saliva from adult patients and detected higher concentrations of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in self-collected saliva than in NP specimens collected at the same
time by health care workers.7 They found that a higher percentage of saliva specimens
than NP specimens were PCR positive during the first 10 days of COVID-19 infection
and concluded that the testing of saliva and NP specimens had at least similar
sensitivities in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by PCR in symptomatic individuals.
We sought to establish the utility of saliva specimens for detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA in symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients. We evaluated the testing
of untreated saliva as well as saliva mixed with a commercially available saliva
stabilizing solution (SpectrumDNA, Spectrum Solutions, Draper, UT). The
SpectrumDNA saliva collection system has been granted Emergency Use Approval
(EUA) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the declared COVID-19
pandemic national emergency. SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of processed and
unprocessed saliva was performed with four EUA-approved assays: Cepheid Xpert
Xpress, DiaSorin Simplexa, GenMark ePlex, and Seegene AllPlex. We also wished to
understand the success of saliva collection from children, who are in different
developmental stages and may have different abilities to provide a saliva specimen.

MATERIALS & METHODS
To determine if saliva was a suitable specimen to use to test children for the
presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, institutional review board (IRB) approval was
obtained and a two-part study was undertaken. The first part of the study was
designed to assess clinical usability/acceptability of saliva as a specimen source in
pediatric patients. The second part of the study consisted of an analytical validation
study of saliva specimens compared to specimens that were collected from the NP.
During the study, saliva and NP specimens were tested with the EUA-approved RTPCR assays available in our high complexity CLIA-accredited laboratory. The assays
were evaluated with respect to validity of results, sensitivity of viral detection using PCR
cycle time (CT) comparison and limit of detection (LOD) analysis as appropriate.

Clinical usability
We conducted a prospective study of patients who were being tested for COVID19 infection in the Emergency Department (ED), peri-operative testing program and
employees being tested through occupational health at our facility. The study
population included symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Each study participant
was tested for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab at
our institution. After informed consent was obtained, subjects were asked to not to eat
or drink for 30 minutes prior to saliva collection and then each subject provided a saliva
specimen. The study used two different collection devices; a urine cup to collect
unprocessed saliva (target volume of 1 – 2 mL) and a commercially available EUAapproved SpectrumDNA saliva collection kit that includes a tube with a line marking a

standard collection volume (3 mL) and a proprietary stabilizing buffer solution (1.5 mL)
that is mixed with the saliva immediately after collection per the manufacturer’s
instructions. We sought to determine whether different saliva collection containers had
characteristics that would be more favorable for sample collection and testing. Study
patients were queried as to whether they felt ill or well at the time of specimen
collection.
We determined the age at which children were able to reliably provide saliva
specimens of sufficient quantity to be successfully analyzed in the laboratory. Because
expectorating on demand requires a minimal level of behavioral maturity, we wished to
determine the lowest age at which adequate saliva collection could be reasonably
expected, either due to behavioral readiness or by producing enough saliva for testing
within a reasonable period of time.

Analytical validity
One of the study goals was to determine which of the EUA-approved SARS-CoV2 PCR assays employed by our laboratory could be successfully adapted to test human
saliva. Available assays included the AllPlex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Inc.,
Seoul, South Korea), the ePlex SARS-CoV-2 Test (GenMark Dx, Carlsbad, CA), the
Xpert Xpress SARS CoV-2, Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and the Simplexa™ COVID-19
Direct assay (DiaSorin Molecular LLC, Cypress, CA)]. The FDA has stated that they do
not intend to object to the use of a test, without their notification or submission of a new
or amended EUA, when the test is a modification of an EUA-authorized test such as
using saliva as a specimen type. Samples used in the validation studies included those

obtained from the clinical usability study described above, spiked saliva specimens
using remnant specimens obtained via NP swab collections and a commercially
available SARS-CoV-2 Standard quantitated at 200,000 copies/mL of all PCR gene
targets (Exact Diagnostics, Fort Worth, TX).
To test saliva specimens using the Simplexa assay, the manufacturer’s
instructions were followed that consists of loading samples directly into the test
cartridges without a preceding extraction step. The Simplexa assay targets the ORF
1ab region and the S gene of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and uses a cycle time positive
to negative cut-off of 40 PCR cycles. To test saliva specimens using the AllPlex
(Seegene) assay, specimens were extracted off-line using either a manual extraction
system (Zymo Quick-RNA) or an automated system (QiaSymphony, Qiagen EZ1
Advanced (Qiagen, Maryland, USA)). The AllPlex assay targets specific nucleic acid
sequence of the E gene, RdRP gene (R), and the N gene of the SARS-CoV-2 genome
and uses a positive to negative cut-off of 40 PCR cycles. To test saliva specimens using
the Xpert Xpress (Cepheid) assay, specimens were extracted and amplified within the
test cartridge. The Xpert Xpress assay targets specific nucleic acid sequences of the E
gene and the N gene of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and uses a positive to negative cutoff of 45 PCR cycles. To test saliva specimens using the ePlex (GenMark) assay,
samples were extracted within the test cartridge. The ePlex test system does not
provide a CT value as part of the result. Because the testing of unprocessed saliva with
the ePlex assay revealed complete inhibition of amplification of the internal control, we
elected to discontinue further evaluation of the assay for saliva specimens.

All four assays were tested with unprocessed saliva and all but the ePlex assay
were tested with saliva collected in using the SpectrumDNA saliva collection kit. When
invalid results (e.g. failure of the internal control to amplify) were obtained, the saliva
specimen was diluted 1:1 with viral transport medium and retested. In addition, when
an invalid result was obtained with the AllPlex assay, specimens were also re-extracted
using an alternative extraction method (either manual or automated as described
above).

Further manipulations to obtain valid results included Proteinase-K and heat

pretreatment as described by others.8
A limit of detection (LOD) analysis of the AllPlex assay was performed starting
with a SARS-CoV-2 commercial standard containing 200,000 copies/mL of all SARSCoV-2 gene targets (Exact Diagnostics). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the standard were
prepared down to 1,000 copies/mL followed by two-fold serial dilutions down to 125
copies/mL to obtain a more precise LOD. Twenty replicates of the dilutions containing
500 copies/mL and 250 copies/mL were tested to determine the concentration at which
at least 19 of the replicates yielded positive results. In all tests, if one or more genes
were detected, the result was considered positive.

RESULTS
The study was undertaken during July – September 2020 at Children’s National
Hospital which is an urban, pediatric, tertiary care medical center located in
Washington, DC. The hospital primarily serves children living in the Washington, DC
metropolitan area, including northern Virginia, and Maryland. The study population
included 526 patients between the ages of 3 and 61 years. The patients in the study
had an overall positive test result rate of 2.4% (12 of 510 valid results). Of the patients,

461 (88%) were <18 years and 425 were asymptomatic (81.1%), 92 were symptomatic
(17.6%) and the symptoms were not recorded in nine patients. Ten samples did not
have enough volume for testing and were excluded (10 of 526, 1.9%). The
unacceptable samples were collected from individuals throughout the age range, with
more seen in younger subjects giving unprocessed saliva (Figure 1). The collecting
staff found that children five years of age and older had the developmental maturity to
consistently provide satisfactory saliva specimens, although younger children generally
required more time than older children and adolescents. There were 425
asymptomatic subjects (81.1%), 92 subjects with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19
infection (17.6%) and nine subjects for whom symptomology information was not
recorded.
The Simplexa (Diasorin) assay had 52 initially invalid samples (14.2% of 365)
due to failed internal controls. Almost all of the samples with invalid test results yielded
valid results after diluting the samples with an equal volume of viral transport medium
(51 of 52, 98.1%).

Saliva samples spiked with positive NP specimens had higher CT

values compared to the NP specimen result (data not shown). When unprocessed
saliva samples were mixed with the SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer or treated with
Proteinase-K and heat, the Simplexa assay internal controls did not amplify.
Accordingly, we decided to discontinue further testing with the Simplexa assay for
clinical use.
The Xpert Xpress (Cepheid) assay testing was limited by the number of test
cartridges we had available. Three examples of saliva spiked with positive NP
specimens and diluted in the SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer provided valid positive

results. Saliva samples spiked with positive NP specimens had higher CT values
compared to the NP specimen result (data not shown), although this can be partially
attributed to the dilution. Because of the low inventory of the test cartridges, we did not
move forward with further testing and limit of detection analysis.
The Allplex (Seegene) assay had 23 initially invalid samples (9.8% of 235
samples) due to failed internal controls. None of the samples with invalid test results
yielded valid results after diluting the samples with an equal volume of viral transport
medium. However, when saliva specimens were mixed with the SpectrumDNA saliva
stabilizer there were zero invalid results. Spiking 30 saliva samples is SpectrumDNA
saliva stabilizer with 100 uL of positive NP specimen yielded 100% correlation of
positive results with comparable CT values (Figure 2a-c). There were five
simultaneously collected positive NP specimens and SpectrumDNA saliva positive
samples tested on the AllPlex assay (Figure 2d-f). There were no negative saliva
results when the matched NP specimen was positive. The analytic sensitivity of the
Allplex assay of saliva in SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer was determined by calculating
the limit of detection (LOD). The LOD was found to be 250 viral RNA copies/mL.
We concluded that the AllPlex assay of saliva samples collected with the
SpectrumDNA saliva collection kit provided the optimum combination of favorable
features including excellent analytic sensitivity, ease of use and results comparable to
those obtained from testing NP samples. We established the recommended lower age
limit for collection of saliva samples with the SpectrumDNA saliva collection kit to be five
years based on the experience of our collecting staff. This age recommendation is not
based on analytical performance.

DISCUSSION
During this investigation, we wished to determine whether saliva specimens
could substitute for NP specimens when testing symptomatic and asymptomatic
children old enough to produce sufficient amounts of saliva upon demand. Our
experience suggests an age cut-off of five years of age, although some younger
children were able to successfully provide saliva. Theoretically, PPE-protected
suctioning of saliva could be employed with younger children, although we did not
pursue that line of investigation during our study.
We assessed the compatibility of four EUA-approved SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays
for testing unprocessed saliva. Our findings indicated that for three of the four assays
we were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus using saliva (Cepheid Xpert Xpress, DiaSorin
Simplexa, and Seegene AllPlex), but the PCR cycle thresholds (CTs) comparison, the
internal control and/or number of invalid samples and/or availability of test cartridges
was not consistent enough to be suitable for ongoing clinical use. Using saliva mixed
with the SpectrumDNA saliva stabilizer demonstrated successful amplification of the
internal controls for the AllPlex assay and had comparable sensitivity (CT values) to the
NP specimens. Because of the availability of PCR reagents and specimen testing
throughput we performed a LOD analysis to determine the analytic sensitivity of the
AllPlex assay. The results demonstrated an LOD of 250 genomic copies/mL, a result
consistent with, or better than the LOD available from the manufacturer (1250 – 4160
viral copies/mL).9
Our study has some limitations. Although over 500 patients gave a saliva
specimens as part of this study, the number with a positive PCR test result was low,

limiting our number of contemporaneous positive NP and saliva specimens. However,
we overcame this by using saliva spiked with positive NP specimens and comparing the
analytical performance using CT values as a more precise measure.
Other authors have found comparable results using the CDC’s version of the
SARS-CoV-2 using unprocessed saliva in symptomatic adult individuals.10 Chong et al.
found testing of saliva collected from children to be less sensitive than testing NP
specimens in viral transport medium. We initially obtained similar results when testing
unprocessed saliva, however, when we collected saliva from children with the
SpectrumDNA saliva collection kit, we found comparable sensitivity as measured by CT
values from NP and saliva specimens.
In conclusion, our study findings indicate that saliva collected from COVID-19
infected symptomatic and asymptomatic children that is mixed with SpectrumDNA
saliva stabilizing solution yields clinically comparable PCR results compared to NP
specimens. Use of saliva SARS-CoV-2 testing will enable greater access to sensitive
PCR testing and may be advantageous for “back to school” testing programs for
children.

Figure 2. Comparison of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva specimens tested by RT-PCR for three gene targets in
ive
the Allplex (Seegene) assay. Panels A – C used a 100uL aliquot of each positive NP sample into 100uL of negative
nd
saliva collected in the SpectrumDNA collection kit, creating a 1:1 dilution. Panels D – F shows NP specimens and
me
contemporaneous saliva specimens were collected using the specimen collection device (SpectrumDNA) in close time
ble
proximity. These results meet the recommended criterion of at least 95% positive and negative agreement for acceptable
clinical performance.
