Abstract
Background
Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2
offer new opportunities for testing in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the reference sample type, but oropharyngeal
swabs (OPS) may be a more acceptable sample type in some patients.
Methods
We conducted a prospective study in a single screening center to assess the
diagnostic performance of the PanbioTM COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott) on OPS
compared with reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using NPS.
Results
402 outpatients were enrolled in a COVID-19 screening center, of whom 168 (41.8%)
had a positive RT-qPCR test. The oropharyngeal Ag-RDT sensitivity compared to
nasopharyngeal RT-qPCR was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two false positives were
noted out of the 234 RT-qPCR negative individuals, which resulted in a specificity of
99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) for the Ag-RDT.
For cycle threshold values ≤ 26.7 (≥ 1E6 SARS-CoV-2 genomes copies/mL, a
presumed cut-off for infectious virus), 96.3% sensitivity (95%CI: 90.7-99.0%) was
obtained with the Ag-RDT using OPS.
Interpretation
Based on our findings, the diagnostic performance of the PanbioTM Covid-19 RDT
with OPS samples meet the criteria required by the WHO for Ag-RDTs (sensitivity

≥80% and specificity ≥97%).

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has killed millions of people worldwide(1). Large
scale testing allows for identification and isolation of infected individuals, and
quarantining contacts, thus limiting community transmission. Currently, SARS-CoV-2
RT-qPCR performed on nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is the gold-standard
diagnostic test. While displaying excellent sensitivity and specificity, RT-qPCR is
costly, subject to reagent and material shortages during pandemics, and requires
experienced personnel and complex infrastructure. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests
(Ag-RDTs) are easy to use, more affordable, decentralizable, and provide quick
results; offering an attractive alternative to RT-qPCR during pandemics. Their
drawbacks are mainly reduced sensitivity relative to RT-qPCR.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers a sensitivity

≥

80% and a

specificity ≥97% as acceptable performance for SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs(2). Currently,
only validations of Ag-RDTs performed with NPS have shown satisfactory results(3–
12), and no studies have evaluated Ag-RDTs using oropharyngeal swabs (OPS).
OPS sampling could be a useful alternative to NPS sampling, as seen with RT-qPCR
tests(13,14). Here we describe a prospective study comparing the diagnostic
performances of an Ag-RDT using OPS with RT-qPCR using NPS for detection of
SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Ethics
The study was approved by the cantonal ethics committee (Commission Cantonale
d'Ethique de la Recherche, CCER, Geneva, Nr. 2020-02323). All enrolled patients
provided written informed consent form.

Setting, study design and participants
The study took place from November 3 to 19, 2020, at an outpatient SARS-CoV-2
screening site at the Geneva University Hospitals. The majority of patients had
symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a small proportion were
asymptomatic contacts. All participants were ≥16 years old.

Sampling procedure
Participants were swabbed twice: one NPS performed by a nurse at the screening
site, for the reference RT-qPCR; and an OPS done by an experienced doctor, using
a tongue depressor in a well-lit environment with an emphasis on consistent
technique, for the Ag-RDT.
A pilot study tested 28 RT-qPCR-positive individuals without ensuring the back of
the oropharynx was reached, yielding only 11 Ag-RDT positives (Supplemental table
1). Therefore, patients were only included if the posterior wall of the oropharynx could
be reached.

Data collection
The clinical data collected for each patient was: duration of any symptoms when
samples were collected, potential close contact with a positive person within 14 days,

symptoms (rhinorrhea, odynophagia, myalgia, chills, dry vs productive cough,
hemoptysis, fever, anosmia, ageusia, gastrointestinal symptoms, asthenia, dyspnea,
chest pain and headache), and comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
chronic lung disease, diabetes, chronic renal failure, active cancer, severe
immunosuppression, pregnancy and obesity (BMI> 40 kg/m2)).

Ag-RDT procedure
Aside from the sample type, the PanbioTM (Abbott) Ag-RDT device was run and read
by a biologist according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Equivocal results were read
by a second healthcare worker.

SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR
All NPS samples were analyzed using the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay on
the 6800 system (Roche), targeting ORF1 and the E-gene. Cycle-threshold (Ct)
values for the E-gene were converted into viral load (VL) with the following formula:
log10 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL=(Ct-44.5)/-3.3372.

Statistical methods
Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity was determined relative to RT-PCR. With a
positivity rate of 37.5%, and an Ag-RDT sensitivity/specificity of 85%/95%, a sample
size of 400 could determine sensitivity and specificity with confidence intervals (CI) of
79.3-90.7% and 92.3-97.7%, respectively. Fischer’s exact test was used to compare
Ag-RDT sensitivity by Ct values (above/below 26.7). All analyses were performed

using STATA version intercooled 16 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 (two-sided).

Results
During the study period, 402 participants were included. Eight patients were
excluded either because the throat was insufficiently accessible or because consent
was withdrawn. The participants’ socio-demographic characteristics are summarized
in supplemental table 2. 168 participants (41.8%) were RT-qPCR-positive with a
mean Ct value of 24.97 (SD ±5.63, 3.3E6 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL equivalent) for
166 RT-PCR analyses. Two specimens, positive for the ORF1 target at a high CT
values but negative for the E-gene, were interpreted as positive in the analysis for
sensitivity and specificity but excluded from Figure 1; both were Ag-RDT negative.
All RT-qPCR-positive participants were symptomatic. Compared to RT-qPCR, the
sensitivity of the Ag-RDT was 81% (95%CI: 74.2-86.6). Two Ag-RDT false-positives
were observed, thus the specificity was 99.1% (95%CI: 96.9-99.9) (Table 1).
The sensitivity of the test for Ct values ≤26.7 (equivalent to ≥1E6 SARS-CoV-2
copies/mL) was 96.3% (90.7-99.0%). Of the OPS samples from RT-PCR-positive
individuals, mean Ct value for Ag-RDT-positive samples was 23.17 while the mean
Ct value for Ag-RDT-negative samples was 32.82, equivalent to 1.1E7 and 1.3E4
SARS-CoV2 copies/mL, respectively (Figure 1).
Ag-RDTs have shown higher sensitivity in individuals with lower Ct values/higher
VL, and in the first days post onset of symptoms (DPOS)(3). As false-negative AgRDT results correlate with low VLs, we expected higher numbers of false negative
results in samples collected later after the onset of symptoms.

For patients presenting within 0-4 DPOS, the sensitivity was 86.1% (n=101;
95%CI: 77.8-92.2). For those presenting within 5-7 and 8-11 DPOS, it was 73.7% (n=
19; 95%CI: 48.8-90.9) and 70.6% (n=17; 95%CI: 44.0-89.7), respectively.
Sensitivities in the presence of fever or chills; fever and cough; fever and anosmia or
fever and cough; and non-specific symptoms, were: 87.5% (n=80; 95%CI: 78.2-93.8),
92.3% (n= 39; 95%CI: 79.1-98.4), 92.5% (n=53; 95%CI: 81.8-97.9), and 84.0%
(n=25; 95%CI: 63.9-95.5), respectively.

Discussion
There are over 10 clinical studies (8 preprints, 2 published) evaluating the
performance of the PanbioTM Ag-RDT(3–12) using only manufacturer recommended
NPS. Those studies, with over 6000 subjects, have reported sensitivity and specificity
ranges of 71.4%-91.7% and 94.9%-100%, respectively. Considering only Ct values
<30 yielded test sensitivities from 87.7% to 97.8%(3,6–9). Similarly, samples from <5
DPOS yielded a sensitivity between 77.2 and 94.8%(3,5,6,8,9).
For some patients in whom NPS sampling is not feasible, OPS could be an
attractive alternative, thus OPS sample validation is critical. This is the first
publication investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the PanbioTM Ag-RDT using OPS.
Our results meet show this off-label use to still meets the WHO targets of ≥80%
sensitivity and ≥97% specificity(2). Interestingly, while ensuring high OPS sample
quality, we obtained similar results to our previously published NPS evaluation, with
no statistical difference in sensitivity and specificity(3).
We previously demonstrated similar clinical and analytical sensitivities between
NPS and OPS sampling for SARS-CoV-2 detection using RT-qPCR(14). However,
some studies showed reduced(13) sensitivity and lower rates of virus isolation in cell

culture for OPS when compared to NPS, suggesting a risk of reduced Ag-RDT
sensitivity when using OPS(15).
Our present study shows that despite the use of OPS, contrary to manufacturer
recommendations, we obtained highly reliable results. Similar to studies on NPS
specimens, the highest sensitivity was seen in the early symptomatic period as well
as for patients presenting with high nasopharyngeal VL. Although a few positive
samples with lower Ct values were missed, the majority of false-negative samples
were from individuals with high Ct values (≥30), corresponding to a low VL below the
presumed cut-off for infectious virus (Ct≤26.7 in our hands); these results suggest
that these individuals are not likely to be contagious and that these false-negative
Ag-RDT results should not result in further transmission.
In conclusion, the use of Ag-RDTs with OPS might prove to be an acceptable
alternative to NPS, and could increase test acceptance for selected groups such as
children.
