ABSTRACT
Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the
ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has reached 28 million cases
worldwide in eight months. The serological detection of antibodies against the virus will play a pivotal
role in complementing molecular tests to improve diagnostic accuracy, contact tracing, vaccine efficacy
testing and seroprevalence surveillance. Here, we aimed first to evaluate a lateral flow assay’s ability to
identify specific IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and second, to report the seroprevalence
of these antibodies among health care workers and healthy volunteer blood donors in Panama. We
recruited study participants between April 30th and July 7th, 2020.

For the test validation and

performance evaluation, we analyzed serum samples from participants with clinical symptoms and
confirmed positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and a set of pre-pandemic serum samples. We used two
by two table analysis to determine the test sensitivity and specificity as well as the kappa agreement
value with a 95% confidence interval. Then, we used the lateral flow assay to determine
seroprevalence among serum samples from COVID-19 patients, potentially exposed health care
workers, and healthy volunteer donors. Our results show this assay reached a positive percent
agreement of 97.2% (95% CI 84.2-100.0%) for detecting both IgM and IgG. The assay showed a
kappa of 0.898 (95%CI 0.811- 0.985) and 0.918 (95% CI 0.839-0.997) for IgM and IgG, respectively.
The evaluation of serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients indicates a correlation between
test sensitivity and the number of days since symptom onset; the highest positive percent agreement
(87% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%)) was observed at ≥15 days post-symptom onset. We found an overall
antibody seroprevalence of 11.6% (95% CI 8.5-15.8%) among both health care workers and healthy
blood donors. Our findings suggest this lateral flow assay could contribute significantly to implementing
seroprevalence testing in locations with active community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral pneumonia and multi-systemic disease caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first appeared in Wuhan,
China in December 2019 [1, 2]. Since then, the virus has spread rapidly with an explosive increase in
cases across the globe. As of 12 September 2020, there have been 28,329,790 confirmed cases of
COVID-19, including 911,877 deaths reported to WHO [3]. According to the Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO), by August, Panama had a rate of 1,618 infected persons per 100,000 inhabitants
[4, 5], placing it as the country with the second highest rate of infection in the Americas. This high rate
is in part related to the fact that Panama is among the countries in the region that have conducted the
highest number of tests. More than 250,000 molecular tests have been conducted since early March,
and daily positivity rates have consistently been in the 30% range; there have been more than 100,000
confirmed cases. In Panama, the majority of reported cases (93.2%) demonstrate mild symptoms, while
6.8% have required hospitalization. To date, there have been 2,140 deaths and over 72,000 patients
have recovered [6].
Until a vaccine becomes available, most countries’ containment efforts have relied heavily on
non-pharmacological interventions to mitigate and suppress the disease. These include, but are not
limited to, movement restrictions and reduced individual contact to decrease community transmission
[7]. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to being a public health emergency, has become a
financial and sociopolitical crisis. Consequently, public health strategies are urgently needed in order to
ease lock-down restrictions [8]. One of the most effective strategies includes prompt and accurate
diagnosis. The development of a diagnostic test that can be scaled-up to allow for mass screening
among specific high-risk groups, such as health care workers (HCW), remains a key step [9, 10]. Such
a test would aid with diagnosis, contact tracing, and vaccine evaluation, while also allowing the release
of individuals from quarantine, as well as serological surveillance at the local, regional, and national
level [11].
More than 150 diagnostics tests have been developed since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic [12]. The most-used platforms are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and rapid
lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) [13]. In general, serological tests based on an LFIA platform are costand time-efficient, do not require sophisticated equipment or highly trained personnel, and can be used
to assess population exposure. In addition, LFIA platforms have generated substantial interest because
they are cheaper to manufacture, store, and distribute, and easier to implement as a point-of-care test.
Unfortunately, some countries have rushed into large-scale deployment of rapid tests but have found
that the clinical sensitivities are low and of poor value due to inadequate performance assessment [14,

15]. The performance of rapid tests provided by manufacturers might show variations. Consequently,
rapid tests should be rigorously validated in a large target population before being used as a standalone screening test [16].
Our study aimed to evaluate the performance of an LFIA for the detection of IgM and IgG antiSARS antibodies in COVID-19-positive individuals[17]. First, we determined the test performance of an
LFIA as a rapid serology test, using a standard panel of sera from COVID-19 patients and prepandemic donors. Second, we conducted a field evaluation of the LFIA test to determine the
seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthy blood donors (HD) and health care
workers (HCW). We found this test to be suitable for conducting seroprevalence studies, assessing
population exposure to the virus, and for evaluating the effects of lock-down flexibilization strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Lateral flow immunoassay overview
We obtained an LFIA test developed by Dr. Chong Li’s group from Institute of Biophysics, Chinese
Academy of Science. The qualitative test (referred to as CAST – Chinese Academy of Science Test,
from this point) detects and is capable of differentiating between specific IgM and IgG antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2. The CAST uses a colored conjugate pad containing a recombinant SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein conjugated with colloid gold as the antigen. The CAST manufacturer’s calculated
analytical sensitivity and specificity for both IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at development
were 87.01% and 98.89%, respectively. During development in China, no cross-reactivity was reported
with specimens from patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis A Virus
(HAV), Hepatitis B soluble Antigen, Hepatitis C Virus, Treponema pallidum, Human T Lymphocyte Virus
(HTLV), Cytomegalovirus, Influenza Virus type A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human Papilloma
Virus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Human
Parainfluenza viruses, as well as other coronaviruses. Moreover, no cross-reactivity or interference was
observed with endogenous substances, including common serum components, such as lipids,
hemoglobin, bilirubin, albumin, uric acid, and glucose, or other common biological analytes, such as
acetaminophen, acetoacetic acid, benzoylecgonine, caffeine, EDTA, ethanol, gentisic acid, βHydroxybutyrate, methanol, phenothiazine, phenylpropanolamine, and salicylic acid.

Test performance evaluation by national reference laboratory
In Panama, the CAST was evaluated independently by the Gorgas Memorial Institute of Health Studies
(GMI), the National Reference Public Health laboratory responsible for COVID-19 diagnostic test
validation, as well as for national molecular SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses.

The real-time reverse-tran-

scription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-qPCR) assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 was used as a nonreference standard [18]. We included 53 SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples confirmed by RTqPCR and 55 pre-pandemic samples that included sera from patients with Dengue and Tuberculosis, in
total 108 samples (Figure 2). All RT-qPCR assays were performed at GMI by trained technicians
following best clinical laboratory practices and quality control assurance programs. The diagnostic
accuracy of the CAST was evaluated as indicated below in the statistical analysis section.
Field evaluation of CAST: Study participants and sample distribution: This study was conducted
between April 30th and July 7th, 2020 in four private and public hospitals and two donation centers
located in Panama and Colon cities (Figure 1). The sample size was calculated using an estimated
sensitivity of at least 80% and a specificity of at least 90% for the CAST. Based on the target population
of the study, which included positive cases and contacts, we assumed a prevalence of at least 15%.
Thus, the sample size was estimated at a minimum of 650 participants, aiming for a 95% level of
accuracy. The inclusion criteria were being an adult over 18 years old and providing written informed
consent. All study participants completed a clinical screening survey for COVID-19-related symptoms
and consented to submit samples for screening of other infections. Only healthy blood donors (HD) that
tested negative for other infectious diseases, including Chagas disease, HIV, HBV, HAV, and HTLV1,
were invited to participate in our study. The exclusion criteria comprised those with missing data and
patients in intensive and semi-intensive care units. Health care workers (HCW) were asked to provide
an additional blood sample 15 days after the first sample was taken. All HCW in contact with confirmed
COVID-19 cases were considered high risk. This study was registered with the Panama Ministry of
Health (No. 1462) and was approved by the National Research Bioethics Committee (CNBI; No. ECCNBI-2020-03-43).
Specimen collection, demographic and clinical data: Predesigned questionnaires related to COVID19 from the World Health Organization (WHO) were completed by trained interviewers. This
questionnaire was given to all study participants. Information on sociodemographic factors, medical
history, current COVID-19 symptoms, and epidemiological data were collected through personal
interviews. Questions related to anosmia and ageusia symptoms were not included in the interview.
Venous blood samples were collected from all the study participants for CAST analysis. The blood

collection tubes were kept at room temperature to allow clot formation and then centrifuged for 10 min
at 250 x g to obtain serum specimens. All rapid test analyses were conducted with fresh serum
samples.
IgM and IgG antibody detection by LFIA: We followed a step-wise protocol for conducting the CAST.
Briefly, we added one drop of serum (approximately 20-25 μl) into the cassette sample well followed by
two drops of the provided buffer (approximately 70 μl). If IgM and/or IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
are present in the sample, they will bind to the colloidal gold conjugate, forming an immunocomplex.
This immunocomplex is then captured by the respective pre-coated band containing either anti-IgM or
anti-IgG antibodies, forming a red colored IgM and/or IgG line. The presence of one red lines indicates
the sample is positive for specific IgM or IgG anti SARS-VoV-2 antibodies, while the presence of two
lines indicates the sample is positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies. A third line functions as a positive
control, indicating that the kit is working properly. All analyses were interpreted by two independent
technicians at 15 minutes after the serum was added. If there were disagreements, a third trained
technician evaluated the result and provided the final decision.
Statistical analysis: Data were analyzed with SPSS version 25.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). A
descriptive analysis was performed to calculate the frequencies and percentages for categorical
variables. Continuous variables were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). For the groups
evaluated with and without COVID-19 disease, the rapid test results were compared against the nonreference standard RT-qPCR. Estimations of Kappa and positive percentage agreement (PPA) were
calculated with a 95% confidence interval [19]. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Study site and study participants:
This study was conducted between April 30th and July 7th, 2020 in four private and public hospitals
located in Panama and Colon cities, as well as the blood donation center in Panama City (Figure 1). A
total of 702 participants were recruited for the field study: 255 (36.3%) were HD, while the remaining
63.7% of the sample comprised 351 HCW and 96 COVID-19 patients (confirmed by RT-qPCR) (Figure
2). Table 1 summarizes the age, sex, COVID-19 exposure, and presence of comorbidities across
participants in the COVID-19 patient, HCW, and HD groups. Among the participants from COVID-19
group, 67 (69.9%) reported a pre-existing chronic disease; whereas 90 (25.6%) HCW and 28 (11.0%)
HD reported a pre-existing chronic disease.

CAST test diagnostic performance using panel of reference sera
Samples including positive and negative COVID-19 cases confirmed by RT-PCR, and a set of prepandemic panel samples were analyzed with the CAST device. A comparison of the CAST and RTPCR results and the analytical performance results are shown in Table 2. For both IgM and IgG
antibodies, the test demonstrated a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.985% (95% C.I. 0.915-1). An
evaluation of the negative percent agreement indicated that of the cases with negative RT-PCR test
results, only five showed positive CAST results for IgM and four showed positive CAST results for IgG.
Two of these cases that were positive for both IgM and IgG were later determined to be false RT-PCR
negatives based on two additional commercial lateral flow immunoassays (data not shown). Virus
clearance may explain the other cases that showed negative RT-PCR results but positive antibodies
results with the CAST. Of the pre-pandemic samples tested (n=55), only one from a patient with a
positive result for Dengue showed a positive IgM result on the CAST platform (data not shown).
We proceeded to evaluate the CAST’s performance in the field during the current COVID-19 pandemic
in Panama. We recruited 96 COVID-19 ward patients (Figure 2). All participants from this group were
RT-PCR-confirmed positive cases and developed moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Analysis of the
COVID-19-confirmed patient group showed a PPA of 67.7% (95% CI 57.8-76.2%) for IgM and IgG antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Data not shown). In order to investigate seroconversion over the course of
COVID-19 evolution in patients, the data from 66 sera samples were divided into three groups
according to the time of sample collection after illness onset. The CAST results showed a PPA of
36.4% (95% CI 19.6-57.1%) for either or both IgM and IgG in patients whose samples were collected
from 0-7 days after RT-PCR diagnosis (Table 3). PPA scores of 76.2% (95% CI 54.5-89.8%) and
71.4% (95% CI 49.8- 86.4%) for IgM and IgG, respectively, were found for patients whose samples
were collected from 8-14 days after positive RT-PCR results. The highest PPA score of 87.0% (95% CI
67.0-96.3%) for both IgM and IgG antibodies was found for samples collected more than 15 days after
diagnosis (Table 3).
Field evaluation of CAST among health care workers and healthy blood donors:
To determine seroprevalence among a potentially exposed population and a population of
healthy donors, we applied the CAST to participants with a high (HCW) and low (HD) risk of exposure
to the virus. We found that forty-five out of 351 HCW tested positive for both IgM and IgG SARS CoV-2
antibodies, which corresponds to a prevalence of 11.61% (95% CI 8.6-15.4%) (Figure 3). In contrast,
86.97% (95% CI 83.0-90.1%) of the HCW samples were non-reactive, while 0.28% (95 C.I 0-1.7%) and
1.42% (95% CI 0.5-3.4%) of the HCW samples were positive for only IgM or only IgG, respectively
(data not shown). Next, we determined the seroprevalence among a group of HD and found that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201459; this version posted December 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this

11.72% (95% CI 8.3-16.3%) of the samples from this group were positive for both IgM and IgG antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Figure 3).Thus, 85.94% (95% CI 81.1-89.7%) of the HD samples were nonreactive, while 0.78% (95% CI 0-3.0%) of the HD samples were positive for only IgM or only IgG
antibodies. We also found that there were no seroprevalence differences among HCW with clinical
responsibilities (nurses and physicians) compared to those without clinical responsibilities
(administrators, laboratory technicians, etc.) (12.9% vs. 14.1%, respectively). In order to determine the
risk of exposure during interactions with hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we asked HCW if they had
been in contact with those patients. We found that those HCW that reported having close contact with
confirmed COVID-19 cases demonstrated a higher seroprevalence than HCW that did not report close
contact (12.4% vs. 1.8%, respectively, data not shown).
We also analyzed differences in the age and gender of seropositive participants. In both the
HCW and HD groups, we found the highest seropositivity among participants in the age range of 20-39
years (48.9% and 64.7%, respectively). Among seropositive HCW, 77.8% were female and 22.2% male
(Table 1). The majority of HCW (75.6%) reported having contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case,
while most of the HD participants reported no contact (70.6%).

.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
Here we report COVID-19 antibody seroprevalence in HCW and HD in Panama. We also report
the performance of a rapid test kit for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies with an LFIA. We
tested serum samples from confirmed positive and negative COVID-19 patients and pre-pandemic
samples collected in 2019. Our analysis showed a high Kappa correlation, indicating very close
agreement between the RT-PCR and CAST. Rashid and colleagues described several rapid detection
test kits and reported sensitivities for both IgM and IgG ranging between 72.7% and 100%, while
specificities ranged from 98.7% to 100% [20]. Adam et al estimates that the sensitivity of rapid tests for
the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ranged from 55-70% when compared to RT-PCR and 6585% when compared to ELISA, with specificities of 95-100% and 93-100%, respectively [21]. Based on
our results, we conclude that the CAST is suitable for seroprevalence studies.
Our study reports the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibodies among a
representative sample of HCW and HD in Panama. Specifically, we investigated the seroprevalence in
a population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and a group of participants with a high risk of infection
(health care workers) and another group with a low risk of contagion (healthy donors).

When we stratified the COVID-19 patient samples according to when they were collected in
terms of number of days after symptom onset, we observed differences in the prevalence of positive
results. A positivity rate of 87.0% (95% CI 67.0-96.3%) for both IgM and IgG antibodies was found in
samples collected 15 days or more after a positive RT-PCR result. Similar to our findings, Pan et al
reported rapid test positivity rates of 11.1%, 92.9%, and 96.8% at the early convalescent (1–7 days
after onset), intermediate (8–14 days after onset), and late convalescent stages (more than 15 days) of
infection, respectively [22]. High sensitivity of serological testing two weeks after symptom onset has
been shown in other studies [23]. In a study by Severance et al, 100% sensitivity was seen at ≥15 days
post-PCR diagnosis, and Tang et al reported 93.8% sensitivity (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at ≥14 days postsymptom onset [24, 25]. Based on our data, the usefulness of the CAST increased significantly two
weeks post symptom onset. This observation indicates that the CAST could be used to evaluate the
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response 14 days after symptom onset, when the positivity rates are
highest.
Regarding the results in HCW and HD participants, we found a seroprevalence of IgM and IgG
antibodies of 11.61% (95% CI 8.6-15.4%) and 11.72% (95% CI 8.3-16.3%) in the HCW and HD groups,
respectively. Given that HCW are a high-risk population [26, 27], it was quite surprising to find that the
seroprevalence was nearly equal between the two groups, similar to a previous report [28]. It is worth
mentioning that special precautions for blood donations are under investigation. To date, previous
reports suggest no direct threat to blood safety itself [29-31]. Likewise, it is important to highlight the
ability of this rapid test to detect antibodies in mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 populations since there
are indications that less severe illness is associated with lower antibody titers [32-35]. As none of the
members of this group reported being hospitalized or having symptoms clearly indicating recent
infection, it is tempting to conclude that these represent asymptomatic cases that were infected while
exposed to COVID-19 patients or in the community.
Theoretically, positive IgM and IgG tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected in patient blood
samples indicate that it is likely that the individual is in the early convalescent stage of infection. Indeed,
serology testing provides an important complement to RNA testing in the later stages of COVID-19 [36].
If only IgG antibodies are detected, then it is probable that the person had an infection sometime in the
past or the patient is in the convalescent stage of infection. Our study reveals the positivity rates for IgM
and IgG between 0 and 15 days after symptoms onset. Several scientists have reported that the
detectable serology markers IgG and IgM have similar seroconversion in COVID-19 patients, with
antibody levels increasing rapidly starting from 4 to 6 days after the appearance of symptoms [21, 22,

37, 38]. Comprehensive studies looking at anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics are warranted to fully
describe their dynamics in the short and long term after infection.
Our study has several limitations. First, we were not able to use samples from individuals with
other respiratory tract infections to rule out cross reactivity with human coronaviruses causing common
seasonal colds. However, a set of 55 pre-pandemic samples was used to validate the test, and all but
one tested negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Second, this rapid test is based on a colorimetric
evaluation of the IgG and IgM bands determined by an operator, which implies the limitations that a
qualitative inter-intra-operator evaluation might produce in terms of variability. In our study, this
limitation was addressed by resorting to double operator evaluation and taking photographs of all test
results to be re-analyzed by a third party in the case of first level evaluation disagreement. Third, the
CAST is a qualitative detection method; thus, the antibody levels in COVID-19 patients were not
measured in this study. Also, the sample size was calculated for the minimum sample required to
validate the test. It is yet to be determined if the CAST produces the same results in a point-of-care
setting using fresh blood samples since we used serum after centrifugation. Moreover, we have not
evaluated if the CAST produces comparative results with ELISA or immunochemiluminescent tests.
Ongoing work by our research team will allow us to establish the CAST’s limits of detection by
comparing results with an ELISA test.
The CAST (rapid test) has some advantages compared to other more complex laboratory-based
tests. Compared to automated ELISA and immunochemiluminescent assays, CAST is economical and
time efficient, does not require advanced equipment, is simple to perform, and requires minimal
training. The CAST can be used for seroprevalence studies in primary health care settings as well as in
specific contexts outside of hospitals, such as high-prevalence areas. Due to its low cost and short
turnaround time, CAST is suitable for large-scale sample screening. In addition, using blood samples
as opposed to nasal swabs could eliminate the need for operational steps that may produce aerosols
and place technicians at higher risk. Some groups have attempted to compare serological tests with
RT-PCR platforms. These tests have different targets and applications. The RT-PCR is intended for
acute phase diagnosis, while the serology tests are intended for antibody seroprevalence studies.
In conclusion, the findings of this cross-sectional study demonstrate the value of the CAST for
the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies at the population level, including health care personnel,
healthy blood donors and other community members. The use of a rapid test among both healthy
individuals and patients to conduct surveillance in outbreak areas could provide critical information
about the status of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a rapid test would allow the characterization of the
pandemic’s behavior at the community level and the identification of transmission hot spots in the

community, which, in turn, would help us to better understand the situation and establish optimal
strategies within quickly changing epidemic scenarios [15]. In addition, it will facilitate the massification
of diagnostic methods allowing us to determine the seroprevalence of the Panamanian population and
the true extent of SARS-CoV-2 community spread.
