Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread widely, causing
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and significant mortality. However, data on viral loads
and antibody kinetics in immunocompromised populations are lacking. We aimed to
determine nasopharyngeal and plasma viral loads via RT-PCR and SARS-CoV-2 serology via
ELISA and study their association with severe forms of COVID-19 and death in kidney
transplant recipients. In this study we examined hospitalized kidney transplant recipients with
non-severe (n = 21) and severe (n =19) COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal and plasma
viral load and serological response were evaluated based on outcomes and disease severity.
Ten recipients (25%) displayed persistent viral shedding 30 days after symptom onset. The
SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the upper respiratory tract was not associated with severe COVID19, whereas the plasma viral load was associated with COVID-19 severity (p=0.0087) and
mortality (p=0.024). All patients harbored antibodies the second week after symptom onset
that persisted for two months. We conclude that plasma viral load is associated with COVID19 morbidity and mortality, whereas nasopharyngeal viral load is not. SARS-CoV-2 shedding
is prolonged in kidney transplant recipients and the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 does
not show significant impairment in this series of transplant recipients.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) emerged
in China, and it has since spread widely across the world.1 The resulting coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) has led to a high death toll. Scientific knowledge on SARS-CoV- 2 has
evolved rapidly since the outbreak, but little is known about responses to the virus in
immunocompromised populations. Infection with respiratory viruses has been shown to be
particularly concerning in transplant recipients due to prolonged viral shedding and a higher
risk of complications.2,3 However, there have been no reports indicating whether SARS-CoV2 infection presents the same risks for transplant recipients as other respiratory viruses.
Determining viral loads and antibody kinetics in immunocompromised individuals is
necessary to protect this highly vulnerable population. Because prolonged viral shedding
and/or a lack of protective immunity could lead to significant viral spread in patients’
environments, protective measures may need to be increased.
We thus conducted a retrospective cohort study in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) in
Alsace, Grand-Est France, to determine the dynamics of nasopharyngeal and plasma viral
loads and SARS-CoV-2 serology and to study their association with mortality and severe
forms of COVID-19.

2. Patients and Methods
2.1 Study population
A total of 40 adult KTR hospitalized with COVID-19 were recruited at our transplant center
between March 4 and April 7, 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed in these patients based on
their clinical symptoms and positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) results obtained using nasopharyngeal swabs and/or typical lung lesions observed
through chest computed tomography (CT). Patient characteristics were retrieved from digital

medical records from the day of admission through the date of last follow-up (May 13, 2020).
Data for the following parameters were collected: demographic variables, symptoms and time
of presentation, immunosuppressive therapy and management, laboratory parameters, chest
CT findings, administered drugs, death, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The study
protocol was reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Board (approval
number: DC-2013-1990).

2.2 Virological diagnosis and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infection
Quantitative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were performed using
nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples obtained at admission and during follow-up for all
but one patient, whose nasopharyngeal swab was collected at another laboratory at the time of
diagnosis. Primer and probe sequences targeted two regions on the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. The assay’s sensitivity was approximately
10 RNA copies per reaction. A SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was considered positive when at
least one of the targets was amplified.4

2.3 SARS-CoV-2 serological assessment
Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 recombinant
nucleocapsid and spike antigens were tested using a commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA; DIA.PRO Diagnostic BioProbes Srl, Sesto San Giovanni,
Italy) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibody levels are presented as measured
absorbance values divided by the cutoff (S/CO). The cutoff value was defined as the mean
absorbance values of the three negative controls plus 0.250. IgM and IgG specificity and
sensitivity reached an overall value of ≥ 98%. Seronegative patients were negative for IgM
and IgG.

2.4 Statistical analysis
Continuous data are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) and were analyzed
using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables are expressed as counts
and percentages and were compared using the Fisher’s exact test. The associations
between maximum nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load and clinical, demographic, and
laboratory variables were determined using Spearman’s correlation coefficient (ρ) values.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to investigate the viral loads
in the upper respiratory tract and plasma with respect to disease severity and mortality.
Survival plots of severe COVID-19-free survival and COVID-19-specific survival were
graphically represented with Kaplan-Meier curves according to RNAaemia (i.e., positive
plasma viral load), using the log-rank test to compare differences in survival. Severe COVID19 was defined as one or more of the following: an oxygen requirement of >6 L/min, the need
for ICU admission, and patient death. Patients were censored at the time of last follow-up.
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA). A p value <0.05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant.

3. Results
3.1 General characteristics of the study patients
A total of 40 patients were included in this study. Their demographic and clinical
characteristics are presented in Table 1. The patients were mainly men (77.5%), with a
median age of 63.8 years (IQR: 54.6−68.2 years) and a median body mass index (BMI) of
29.5 kg/m2 (IQR: 24−33 kg/m2). The median time after kidney transplantation was 6.6 years
(IQR: 2.8−14.6 years). At the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, 35 (87.5%) patients were
receiving calcineurin inhibitors (CNI). Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid

(MPA) was being taken by 34 patients (85%), mTOR inhibitors were being administered to 6
(15%) patients, and steroids were taken by 23 (57.5%) patients. The median interval between
the onset of symptoms and COVID-19 diagnosis was 4 days (IQR: 3−7 days). All but two
patients had a fever. Respiratory (n=34, 85%) and gastrointestinal (n=31, 77.5%) symptoms
were the most common clinical manifestations. Twenty-one patients had a non-severe clinical
presentation, whereas 19 had a severe clinical course. During follow-up, the mortality rate
was found to be 22.5% (9/40).

3.2 Viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs
A total of 118 upper respiratory specimens were analyzed (median of three swabs per patient
[IQR: 2−3 swabs]). The median viral load was 5.17 log10 copies/reaction (IQR: 3.80−6.69) at
diagnosis (between day 0 and day 14 after symptom onset). A total of 29 patients (74.4%) had
their peak viral load at admission, and two patients hospitalized at day 10 and day 11 after
symptom onset had negative RT-PCR results at admission and during the follow-up. The viral
load at admission was not statistically different between severe and non-severe patients (6.22
log10 copies/reaction versus 5.17 log10 copies/reaction, respectively p=0.29) and was not
predictive of disease severity (area under the ROC curve = 0.595, p=0.31) at admission, at the
peak of viral load (Figure 1a and 1b), or during the course of the disease (Figure 2). Recipient
age (ρ=0.23, p=0.16, Figure 3) and sex (p=0.05) were marginally associated with the viral
load. Notably, patients receiving steroid therapy and not presenting gastrointestinal symptoms
displayed a higher viral load (Table 2). No correlation was evident between maximum viral
load and inflammatory markers, including interleukin (IL)-6 (ρ=0.041, p=0.81) and C-reactive
protein (CRP, ρ=0.001, p=0.99). Among patients with an initial positive RT-PCR test result
(n=37), no patient showed a viral clearance before D21. Fifteen (38.5%) patients displayed a

positive viral load greater than 3 log10 copies/reaction after D10, and ten patients (24.4 %)
showed persistent viral shedding after D30 (Figure 2).

3.3 SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia
SARS-CoV-2 loads were measured in 73 plasma samples obtained from 32 patients (21 in the
non-severe group and 11 in the severe group). Plasma viral loads ranged from 1 to 4.55 log10
copies/reaction. Ten patients had at least one positive RNAaemia. Severe patients showed a
higher frequency of RNAaemia compared with non-severe patients (50% versus 26.3%,
respectively, p=0.0087, Figure 4a). Moreover, RNAaemia was found to be associated with
mortality (Figure 4b). Accordingly, RNAaemia was positive in all three non-survivors tested;
in contrast, only 7 of 29 (24%) tested survivors had positive RNAaemia (p=0.024).
Furthermore, two non-survivors harbored high viral loads (4.55 log10 copies/reaction and 4.26
log10 copies /reaction), whereas other patients were characterized by low RNAaemia (< 2.16
log10 copies/reaction). With regard to immunosuppressive therapy, patients receiving CNI
tended to have more positive RNAaemia (10/24 versus 0/5, respectively, p=0.13).

3.4 SARS-CoV-2 serological findings
A total of 116 samples from 35 patients were analyzed, with a median of three sera tested per
patient (IQR: 2−4 sera). All survivors were seropositive at follow-up. Four non-survivors had
negative serology at their time of death, which occurred on D7, D10, D15, and D16. The two
patients with a negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result had positive serology, with one patient
showing positive serology at the time of diagnosis. Among the 25 samples tested before D8,
six (24%) were seropositive, whereas all samples tested after D14 were seropositive (Figure
5). The kinetics of the antibodies showed that a stable titer of IgG antibodies was maintained
until D59, suggesting persistence of immunity for at least until two months after infection

(Figure 6). Notably, IgM and IgG antibody level and delays in seroconversion were not
correlated with COVID-19 severity (Figure 7a and 7b).

4. Discussion
In this retrospective study conducted in a sample of 40 immunocompromised KTR
hospitalized for COVID-19, we precisely determined the temporal evolution of
nasopharyngeal and plasma SARS-CoV-2 loads, as well as the serological response to the
virus. All parameters were correlated with patient characteristics, disease severity, and clinical
outcomes. In our study, the viral load in the respiratory specimens of most patients was at the
peak at the time of diagnosis. This finding is in line with those previously reported for the
general population.5–7 Based on the data we analyzed, the viral load at the time of diagnosis
did not predict the severity of the disease. Moreover, viral loads were not related to
inflammatory markers that have been previously associated with COVID-19 severity.8
Reports on the relationship between viral load and disease severity are contradictory; three
studies showed no correlation between the severity of the disease and the viral load in
respiratory specimens,6,7,9 whereas Liu et al.10 described a higher viral load in patients with
more severe disease.
In our immunocompromised population with a median follow-up of 53 days, the duration of
viral detection in the respiratory tract was longer compared to that in the general population.
More than a third of our patients displayed a high viral load after D10. Furthermore, almost a
quarter of them still had viral shedding at D30; in contrast, in immunocompetent populations,
the median duration of viral shedding was 20 days.12 Thus, even if a positive RT-PCR result
does not indicate an infectious virus, we should be cautious about viral spread in vulnerable
populations and extend isolation after a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was positive in 32% of our KTR with COVID-19. To our
knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia in immunocompromised patients had not been
previously described. Nonetheless, this finding is in accordance with what was observed in
the general population (ranging from 10.4% to 41% positivity for RNAaemia).8,12,13 Our study
shows that RNAaemia is associated with disease severity and mortality in KTR patients.
However, published data on the subject are mixed. In studies conducted by Huang et al.12 and
Zheng et al.13, RNAaemia was not associated with COVID-19 severity, whereas in the cohort
study carried out by Chen et al.8 positive RNAaemia was correlated with highly elevated IL-6
plasma leveland was only detected in critically ill patients. In the study by Hadjadj et al.9,
patients with severe and critical COVID-19 had higher plasma viral loads than those with
mild and moderate disease. The pathophysiological mechanism of the association between
COVID-19 severity and plasma viral load is still unclear; perhaps the cytokine storm that
affects COVID-19 severity could enhance RNAaemia by causing increased vascular
permeability, or a significant viral load could trigger the cytokine storm.8
Regarding the SARS-CoV-2 humoral response, this is the largest study with the longest
follow-up in an immunocompromised population. All but four patients had positive serology
during the follow-up. The four negative patients were tested early in the course of the disease
and died shortly after. A total of 13 (43.3%) patients displayed positive serology before D15,
supporting the potential usefulness of serology tests for acute diagnosis. All patients harbored
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from D15 onwards. Data on the serological response to SARS-CoV2 in immunocompromised populations remain scanty. In a study from the United States, nine
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 after a solid organ transplant had positive IgG serology,
with a delay of seroconversion between D6 and D27. 14 Zhao et al.15 reported a delayed
antibody response in a patient co-infected with COVID-19, HIV, and hepatitis C. In the
general population, studies have reported seroconversion for all patients between the third and

fourth week after symptom onset, which is concordant with our findings. These results
suggest that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response is not significantly impaired in our
immunocompromised population.16, 17, 18 Notably, the delay after transplantation was long in
our cohort, and only one patient had undergone depleting induction therapy during the year
preceding COVID-19. The level of IgG remained steady until two months after onset of
symptoms. Although the neutralizing effect of the antibodies was not studied here, it is
encouraging that IgG levels are correlated with a neutralizing effect in the general
population.6,16
Despite some limitations of this study, including the small sample size and lack of data from
some patients, this is the first report that provides a precise assessment of SARS-CoV-2
virological and antibody response kinetics in an immunocompromised population, with a
follow-up for two months after symptom onset. Taken together, our data indicate that 1)
SARS-CoV-2 shedding from the upper respiratory tract is prolonged in KTR patients,
indicating the requirement for prolonged protective measures for these patients; 2) the SARSCoV-2 plasma load is associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality, whereas the viral
load of the upper respiratory tract is not; and 3) based on the presence of antibodies in all
samples collected by us after the second week of symptom onset, the SARS-CoV-2 humoral
response in our immunocompromised population does not show serious impairment and the
antibodies persist until two months after COVID-19 symptom onset.
