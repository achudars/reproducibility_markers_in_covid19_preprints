Abstract
Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We examined i)
the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other

respiratory viral infections a year previous; and ii) concordance between smoking status recorded on the

electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes.

Methods: This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National
Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another

respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current

smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were

performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science

Framework.

Results: Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other
respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj =0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96,

p=.04). There was no significant

association among former smokers (ORadj =1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65,

p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the

EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%)

2

controls (χ (3)=256.5,

p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001).

Conclusions: In a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with
COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this

association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR-

medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.

1. Introduction

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are in excess of 118 million

confirmed COVID-19 cases globally, with over 2.6 million deaths reported (Johns Hopkins Coronavirus

Resource Center, 2021). Large age and sex differences in case severity and mortality have been observed

(Guan et al., 2020), with hypertension, diabetes and obesity identified as important risk factors (Fang et al.,

2020). There are

a priori reasons to believe that current smokers are at increased risk of contracting COVID-

19 and experiencing greater disease severity once infected. SARS-CoV-2 enters epithelial cells through the

ACE-2 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Evidence suggests that gene expression and subsequent ACE-2

receptor levels are elevated in the airway and oral epithelium of current smokers (Brake et al., 2020; Cai,

2020), potentially making smokers vulnerable to contracting SARS-CoV-2. Other studies, however, show

that smoking downregulates the ACE-2 receptor (Oakes et al., 2018). In addition, smoking involves repeated

hand-to-mouth movements, which may mean smokers are more likely to contract respiratory viruses such

as SARS-CoV-2 (Simons et al., 2020). Early data from the ongoing pandemic have not provided clear

evidence for an association of smoking status with COVID-19 outcomes, with a living review and unadjusted

Bayesian meta-analysis of over 60 studies indicating that current compared with never smokers may be at

reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while former smokers are at increased risk of hospitalisation, disease

severity and in-hospital mortality compared with never smokers (Simons et al., 2021).

Most studies to date have been limited by the lack of appropriate controls, poor recording of smoking

status and insufficient adjustment for relevant covariates. Many studies relied on routine electronic health

records (EHRs) to obtain data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities and smoking status. This is

problematic, as previous research suggests that data on smoking status obtained via EHRs tend to be

incomplete or outright inaccurate, with implausible longitudinal changes observed (Polubriaginof et al.,

2018). As hospitalised populations differ by age and sex from the general population (Secondary Care

Analytical Team, 2020), comparisons of current and former smoking prevalence in hospitalised and non-

hospitalised populations are likely biased. There is therefore a need for alternative study designs with

relevant comparator groups and adjustment for covariates to better understand the association of smoking

status with COVID-19 disease outcomes.

However, the selection of an appropriate comparator group is not straightforward. Ideally, controls should

represent the underlying population from which cases emerged, both geographically and demographically

(Grimes and Schulz, 2005). In the context of COVID-19 hospitalisation, disease severity and death, we

therefore reasoned

a priori that historical controls – i.e. patients hospitalised at the same trust with

another respiratory viral infection (e.g. influenza) a year previous – would act as a useful comparator, as

they represent a geographically matched population at risk of severe disease from a circulating respiratory

virus with a similar route of transmission (i.e. respiratory droplets and aerosols) and detection (i.e.

laboratory-confirmed infection prior to or upon hospitalisation) (McCarthy and Giesecke, 1999). In addition,

risk factors for hospitalisation with other respiratory viruses are similar to those for hospitalisation with

COVID-19 (e.g. older age, comorbidities) (Falsey et al., 2014; Peralta et al., 2010).

In the present case-control study, we therefore aimed to examine i) the association of smoking status with

hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections

(e.g. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus) a year previous at a single UK hospital trust; and ii) whether there

is discordance between smoking status recorded on the summary EHR and within the contemporaneous

medical notes. As current smoking in April 2020 (when our study protocol was registered) was

a priori

expected to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation (Alqahtani et al., 2020; Simons

et al., 2020), and with the association expected to be of a similar magnitude to that observed for other

respiratory viruses, we opted for a non-inferiority design to test the hypothesis that the proportion of

current smokers in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is similar to that in patients hospitalised with other

respiratory viral infections a year previous.

2. Methods
2.1. Study design

This was an observational case-control study with historical controls, performed at a single National Health

Service (NHS) hospital trust (comprising two hospital sites) in London, UK. The study protocol and analysis

plan were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework in April 2020 (https://bit.ly/3kFYh06). The pre-

registered protocol stipulated a non-inferiority design (i.e. a one-tailed statistical test) to maximise

statistical power to detect a significantly lower proportion of current smokers (i.e. <10%) among patients

hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with patients hospitalised with another respiratory viral infection a

year previous (i.e. 20%). The protocol was amended after data collection but prior to statistical analysis in

September 2020 (https://osf.io/ezfqs/) to implement a traditional case-control design (i.e. a two-tailed

statistical test), as a delay in study approval meant that the number of eligible cases and controls exceeded

our expectations, providing sufficient power for a two-tailed test. We had also planned to compare current

smoking in cases with age- and sex-matched London prevalence, with data obtained from the

representative Annual Population Survey. However, following external review on an earlier manuscript

draft, we decided against presenting data from this comparison due to smoking rates in hospitalised

populations typically being greater than in the general population (Benowitz et al., 2009). A completed

STROBE checklist is available in Supplementary file 1. Ethical approval was obtained from a local research

committee and approved by the NHS Health Research Authority (IRAS_282704). The requirement for

informed consent was waived due to the nature of the study.

A sample size calculation, updated after data collection but prior to data analysis (https://osf.io/ezfqs/),

indicated that 363 cases and 109 controls would provide 80% power to detect a 10% difference in current

smoking prevalence in cases compared with controls (e.g. 10% in cases and 20% in controls) with alpha set

COVID-19 test and 2 days for receiving and reporting the results on the EHR. The median

incubation time for COVID-19 is estimated at 5.1 days (95% CI = 4.5-5.8) (Lauer et al., 2020).

We sought to exclude individuals with nosocomial COVID-19 infection as they are a

Data on demographic and smoking characteristics were collected from the summary EHR or the medical

notes. In the UK, the summary EHR is produced at the point of an individual's first interaction with a specific

NHS hospital trust. Further information is added to the summary EHR following subsequent interactions

with the hospital trust. The medical notes include contemporaneous clinical notes, General Practitioner

referral letters and outpatient clinic letters, and are updated more frequently than the summary EHR.

2.3.1. Outcome variable

The outcome of interest was the type of hospital admission (i.e. with COVID-19 vs. other respiratory viral

infections a year previous).

2.3.2. Exposure variable

Smoking status (i.e. current, former, never) was obtained from the summary EHR or the medical notes. A

number of cases were recorded as ‘non-smokers’ without distinguishing between ‘former smokers’ and

‘never smokers’. For the primary analysis, patients categorised as a ‘non-smoker’ were treated as ‘never

smokers’. Where possible, information on use of smokeless tobacco, waterpipe and/or alternative nicotine

products (e.g. e-cigarettes) was extracted. The joint first authors searched within the contemporaneous

medical records for free-text entries of smoking status. The most recently available record of smoking

status, obtained from either the summary EHR or the medical notes, was extracted. Where available, data

on pack-year history of smoking were extracted.

2.3.3. Covariates

Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic position (SEP; with post codes linked by the research

team to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (Department for Communities and Local Government,

2019)) and comorbidities (classified by organ system, including cardiac, metabolic and respiratory diseases).

Medical conditions not expected to be strongly associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation were not

considered in the analyses (e.g. sciatica and fibromyalgia; see Supplementary file 1). Age was treated as a

continuous variable in the primary analysis, with banded age groups (i.e. 18-29 years, 30-44 years, 45-59

years, 60-74 years, 75-89 years and > 90 years) used in exploratory analyses. The IMD was categorised as

quintiles to reduce the impact of sparse data.

All analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2.(R Core Team, 2020) Descriptive statistics for cases and

controls are reported. To explore differences between cases and controls, Pearson’s Chi-square tests,

Cochran-Armitage tests for trend and ANOVAs were used, as appropriate.

To examine the association of former and current smoking with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared

with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections, unadjusted and two different adjusted generalised

linear models with a binomial distribution and logit link function were performed. The first model adjusted

for age, sex and SEP, with a second model adjusting for age, sex, SEP and comorbidities. We report odds

ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and

p-values. Two sensitivity analyses were subsequently

performed. First, those recorded as ‘non-smokers’ were removed from the analysis. Second, those

excluded from the analytic sample due to missing data on smoking status (see section above on ‘Exclusion

criteria’) were included and coded as i) ‘never smokers’ and then as ii) ‘current smokers’ to assess the

robustness of the associations.

To examine the concordance between smoking status recorded on the summary EHR and within the

contemporaneous medical notes, Pearson’s Chi-squared tests were performed for the entire sample, and

then separately for cases and controls.

3. Results

A total of 610 potential cases and 514 potential controls were identified. A total of 446 cases and 211

controls were included in the analytic sample (see Figure 1). Thirteen potential controls and 60 potential

cases were excluded due to not having a record of documented smoking status. This was likely due to

patients having no prior contact with the NHS foundation trust. Notably, 37 (62%) of potential cases that

were excluded because of missing smoking status did not survive to hospital discharge, with no in-hospital

mortality in potential controls, which suggests that data may be missing due to increased mortality in cases.

Figure 1. Eligibility flow diagram for controls (left hand side) and cases (right hand side).

Compared with controls, cases were more likely to be male (55% vs. 35.9%) and older (64.9 years vs 62.5

years) (see Table 1). Approximately 10% of cases and controls had missing data for ethnicity. Compared

with cases, controls were more likely to be admitted from more deprived areas (IMD quintiles 1 and 2)

(41.8% vs. 32.9%,

p < 0.001). Cases were more likely than controls to have pre-existing metabolic (30.3% vs

13.3%) and cardiac comorbidities (53.4% vs 30.3%). A significantly larger proportion of cases compared with

controls did not survive to discharge (28.7% vs. 4.3%). Among 128 cases not surviving to discharge, 53

(41.4%) were never smokers, 63 (49.2%) were former smokers and 12 (9.4%) were current smokers. For

patients who survived to discharge, the median length of hospital stay for cases and controls was 9 (IQR =

4-18) and 4 (IQR = 2-9) days, respectively (see Table 1).

Cases and controls were predominantly admitted from North central and North East central London (see

Supplementary file 1). The number of cases admitted from peripheral locations was greater than in controls

and represents transfer of inpatients from other hospitals and diversion of patients that would otherwise

have attended local hospitals due to bed pressures. The Chi-square test for trend found inconclusive

2

evidence for any difference in SEP between cases and controls, χ (3) = 8.93,

p = 0.06 (see Supplementary

file 1).

3.1. Association of smoking status with type of hospitalisation

The prevalence of former smoking was higher in cases compared with controls (38.6% vs. 31.8%). Current

smoking prevalence was lower in cases compared with controls (9.4% vs. 17.1%). A single patient from the

case cohort was recorded as a dual cigarette and e-cigarette user. Two patients, one from each cohort,

were recorded as dual cigarette and shisha/waterpipe users. Pack-year history of smoking was only

recorded for 40% of patients with a smoking history (see Table 1).

In the univariable analysis, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19

compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31-0.86,

for former smokers were equivocal (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.81-1.68,

p = 0.01). The odds

p = 0.43).

In the multivariable analysis adjusted for sex, age and SEP, current smokers had reduced odds of being

hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (OR = 0.48, 95% CI =

0.28-0.83,

1.34,

p < 0.01). There was no significant association among former smokers (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.61-

p = 0.61). Results were not materially altered when also adjusting for relevant comorbidities (current

smokers, OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31-0.96,

p = 0.04; former smokers, OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.72-1.61, p = 0.70).

3.2. Sensitivity analyses

First, in a sensitivity analysis with patients recorded as ‘non-smokers’ excluded from the sample (leaving

of being a current smoker compared with those admitted with other respiratory viruses (OR = 0.51, 95% CI

= 0.30-0.88,

p = 0.01). Next, when those with missing data on smoking status were treated as ‘current

smokers’, there was no significant association between current smoking and hospitalisation with COVID-19

(OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.61-1.46,

p = 0.80).

3.3. Concordance of smoking status recorded on the summary EHR and the medical notes

Controls were more likely to have no record of smoking status on the summary EHR compared with cases

(75.4% vs. 7%) (see Figure 2). However, smoking status could be ascertained from the contemporaneous

medical notes for all included cases and controls. Smoking status on the summary EHR (including ‘unknown’

2

status) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ (3) = 226.7,

p = < 0.001).

In cases, six current smokers were misclassified as former smokers, one current smoker as a never smoker

and six current smokers had no record of smoking status on the summary EHR. In controls, six current

smokers were misclassified as former smokers and 23 current smokers had no record of smoking status on

the summary EHR. There was greater discordance between smoking status recorded on the summary EHR

2

and within the contemporaneous medical notes in controls (χ (3) = 256.5,

34.2,

p = < 0.001) than in cases (χ

p = < 0.001).

4. Discussion

This observational case-control study with patients admitted to a single UK hospital trust found a lower

proportion of current smokers in cases hospitalised with COVID-19 during the first phase of the pandemic

compared with controls hospitalised with other respiratory viral infections a year previous. Further, we

found that smoking status is typically poorly recorded in the summary EHR. This was more prominent in

controls than cases – a difference that is likely explained by the observation that COVID-19 patients were

followed up by the respiratory medicine team after discharge as part of a COVID-19 follow-up clinic where

they specifically asked about smoking status (Mandal et al., 2020). The observed discrepancy between

smoking status recorded on summary EHRs and the contemporaneous medical notes is a concern,

particularly for studies relying solely on EHRs as the source of information on smoking status.

4.1. Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is one of few studies specifically designed to examine the association between

smoking status and hospitalisation with COVID-19. It was further strengthened by an assessment of the

quality of data on smoking status gleaned from summary EHRs.

However, this study has several important limitations, the majority of which pertain to the selection of the

controls. First, current smoking is expected

a priori to be associated with hospitalisation for non-COVID-19

respiratory viruses (Stämpfli and Anderson, 2009). Ideally, hospital-based case-control studies should avoid

selecting a control disease which is associated with the exposure of interest (i.e. smoking status)

(Vandenbroucke and Pearce, 2012). However, to our knowledge, there is no other control disease with a

similar route of acquisition and mechanism for hospitalisation/severe disease that is not

a priori also

associated with smoking status. The greater smoking prevalence in controls compared with the general

population from which the cases emerged (Vandenbroucke and Pearce, 2012) therefore likely contributes

to the significantly reduced odds of current smoking in our cases.

Second, the risk profile for controls likely differs from cases in that there is prior immunity to other

respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza, respiratory syncytial virus), with no prior immunity in the population to

SARS-CoV-2.

Third, we selected the controls on the basis of sharing a similar route of transmission and risk factors for

hospitalisation as cases. However, at the time of writing (March 2021), we now suspect that COVID-19

differs from other respiratory viruses in several ways. For example, COVID-19 gains cell entry via the ACE-2

receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020) – with unknown receptor binding in flu (Killingley and Nguyen-Van-Tam,

13

2013) – and appears to display less fomite and physical contact transmission than flu (Ben-Shmuel et al.,

2020). In addition, emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 has a significantly different pathological

process compared with other respiratory viruses. For example, mortality rates from COVID-19 differ widely

from those due to epidemic influenza (Office for National Statistics, 2020a). Although we currently do not

know the importance of these factors, taken together, emerging observations may mean that direct

comparison of risk profiles in cases and controls is limited.

Fourth, while no known behavioural restrictions were implemented during the control period, London was

under lockdown restrictions from March to July 2020, which likely impacted the risk of viral exposure in

cases (Davies et al., 2020). This may further have impacted the different risk profiles of controls and cases

beyond the adjustments made in this analysis for sex, age and SEP.

Fifth, the selection of historical controls may mean that there are non-trivial differences in smoking status

between controls and cases due to a declining trend in London smoking prevalence (Office for National

Statistics, 2020b). However, as a single year was used for the selection of controls, and there was no large

change in national smoking prevalence from 2019 to 2020 in England (Brown, 2020), we expect any impact

of the time-varying exposure to be minimal. We considered using a contemporaneous control (i.e. patients

hospitalised with other respiratory viral infections in 2020), which would have mitigated against this

potential bias. However, due to factors such as reduced national and international travel, physical

distancing, increased hand hygiene and potential viral dominance by COVID-19, exposure to and

hospitalisation with other respiratory viruses has been substantially reduced in 2020 (GOV.UK, 2020), which

would have limited the sample size for controls.

Sixth, a history of current or past cancer was high in both groups at greater than 20% and was significantly

greater in controls compared with cases. This reflects a bias in the population that regularly interacts with

the selected NHS hospital trust, which is a specialist cancer referral centre. We visualised the geographic

regions where patients were admitted from to examine any systemic differences between cases and

controls, and caution that the differing catchment areas of the two cohorts may have led to important

differences in the underlying populations. In addition, during the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in

the UK, many cases were transferred across hospital sites due to bed pressures.

Finally, there was a greater proportion of cases than controls with no record of smoking status on either

the summary EHR or within the contemporaneous medical notes (thus, they were not eligible for inclusion),

with patients with missing data having unusually high mortality. It is plausible that many of them were

smokers. We attempted to mitigate against this by conducting several sensitivity analyses, with the results

largely remaining robust. However, when those excluded from the cohort due to missing data on smoking

status were treated as current smokers, there was no significant association between current smoking and

hospitalisation for COVID-19.

Despite these limitations, alternative designs were impracticable or would have had different limitations. In

the future, the current study can be considered alongside findings across multiple such alternative

methodological approaches, each with different sources of bias, to triangulate on the extent to which

associations between smoking and COVID-19 are causal.

4.2. Implications for policy and practice

COVID-19 will continue to place a large burden on healthcare services in the UK and internationally over the

coming months and years. To mitigate against this, multiple non-pharmacological interventions are being

implemented to reduce the intensity of demand on acute and intensive services. Irrespective of any direct

link between smoking and COVID-19 disease outcomes, smoking is a significant cause for healthcare

demand globally. We have argued elsewhere for the need to ramp up smoking cessation support to reduce

the current and future burden on healthcare and social services (Simons et al., 2020).

4.3. Avenues for future research

The selection of appropriate controls in hospital-based case-control studies is very challenging for a novel

respiratory virus such as COVID-19 (which means we converged on a hybrid approach, combining elements

from hospital-based case series and case-control designs with historical controls). We recommend the use

of representative population-studies with data from multiple sites and with purposeful acquisition of

smoking status to better understand the role of smoking as a potential risk or protective factor for COVID-

19 hospitalisation and disease severity.

5. Conclusion

In a single hospital trust in the UK, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19

compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although we caution against interpreting this as a

causal association. Smoking status was poorly recorded, with high observed discordance between smoking

status recorded on the summary EHR and the contemporaneous medical notes.
