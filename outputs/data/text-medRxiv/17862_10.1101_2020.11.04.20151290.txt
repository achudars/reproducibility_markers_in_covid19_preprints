ABSTRACT:
The impact of Zinc (Zn) sufficiency/supplementation on COVID-19 mortality and infections remains
unknown. During an infection, the levels of free Zinc are reduced as a part of ‘nutritional immunity’ to
limit the growth and replication of pathogens and ensuing inflammatory damage. However, considering
its key role in immune competence and the widespread deficiency in large sections of different
populations (3-54%), prophylactic and therapeutic Zn supplementation has become part of routine
prescription even without any evidence for its protective role in COVID-19. Expectedly, multiple trials
are ascertaining the positive effect of Zn supplementation on COVID-19 when given in combination with
standard of care treatments. However, the trials’ designs seem to lack the power to identify negative
effects especially in the currently identified vulnerable groups, e.g., elderly, comorbid (contributing 9 out
of 10 deaths; up to >8000-fold higher mortality). When we analyze the COVID-19 data from 23 socially
similar European populations with supposedly comparable confounders (population: 522.47 million;
experiencing up to >150 fold difference in death rates) and at the matching stage of the pandemic (12
March - 26 June 2020; 1st wave of infections), the populations’ Zn-sufficiency status is found
consistently positively correlated with COVID-19 mortality (r(23): 0.7893–0.6849, p-value<0.0003) and
infections [r(23):0.8084 to 0.5658; p-value<0.005]. The observed association is contrary to what would
be expected if Zn sufficiency was being protective in COVID-19. Thus, controlled trials or retrospective
analysis of the adverse event patients’ data seem warranted to correctly guide the practice of Zn
supplementation in COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION:
Zinc (Zn) is a redox-neutral key micronutrient that plays an important role in immune competence and
wellbeing (1-3). Worldwide, the explicit and implicit general recommendations for immune augmentation
of the supposed ‘Zn-deficient’ population components and COVID-19 patients by healthy diet or Zn
supplementation are in place. The Zn supplementation is recommended as an adjunctive therapy
option by CDC’s ‘COVID-19 treatment panel guidelines’ to supplement the presumed protective role of
Zn in infections and other immune and oxidative stress-related conditions/pathologies relevant to
COVID-19 (4-7). Lately, a huge surge in the number of articles advocating a role for Zinc
supplementation in COVID-19 treatment/management has been observed (keywords ‘((Zinc) AND
(COVID-19)) AND (treatment)’ yielded 117 articles in Pubmed on 14 Jan 2021(8). Speculative benefit
from Zn supplementation in COVID-19, interpretational and implementational issue with the panel
guidelines regarding recommended daily dietary intake due to unavailability of reliable measures of
actual deficiency in individuals or the daily dietary intake estimates, combined with the relatively milder
side effect of Zn overdose in the majority of the population appeared to have fueled its widespread
prescription and over-the-counter purchases. The actual figures of the total increase in Zn
supplementation worldwide as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are not in the public domain but from
news articles, it may be surmised that it had already registered a surge by mid-April of 2020 and have
steadily increased in different markets/countries since then as per news reports (9-11). However, the
clinical evidence supporting any possible beneficial effect of Zinc supplementation or the ecological
association studies unequivocally supporting the potential positive impact of Zn sufficiency of the
population/individuals on SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 disease are practically nonexistent. The push
for Zn supplementation in COVID-19 also seems to stem from the observed negative impact of
physiologically ‘irrelevant levels’ of Zinc in suppressing in vitro viral replications in general [REFs 12]
and coronaviruses in particular [13]. Globally, Zn deficiency among populations ranges from 3-54%
(14). The developed European and North American nations generally have the highest sufficiency while
African and Asian nations the least. Its deficiency in populations is widely associated with vulnerability
to infectious diseases, chronic immune system disorders, and medical conditions (3-5,7,14,15).
The Zn levels are tightly regulated in the human body and its differential levels are maintained in
various organs, tissues, and extracellular milieu including serum through a complex homeostasis
mechanism involving multiple regulators and transporters (1, 16-18). Optimal levels are maintained in
different tissues, organs as well as immune cells to regulate inflammation and pathogen clearance,
reduce reactive oxygen radicals, and affect various bodily processes including lipid metabolism and
glucose levels. During infections, Zn levels are reduced in serum and redistributed to tissues and
immune cells as a part of ‘nutritional immunity’ to check pathogens’ growth and replication by

withholding Zn availability for its key essential functions (REFs 1, 16, 18, 19). The intracellular Zn
reserves are also mobilized and reallocated by elaborate and intricate machinery in the presence of
intracellular pathogens in an attempt to reduce the availability of free Zn to limit their survival and
diminish replication potential and at the same time signal neighboring cells the presence of pathogens
and balance inflammation (REFs in 1, 2, 16, 18, 19). Zn insufficiency is associated with frequent
infections and chronic inflammation. In the absence of more accurate measures of Zn
deficiency/sufficiency the lower serum levels in conjunction with the presence of associated symptoms
of Zn deficiency are used to diagnose pathological deficiency fit for preventive supplementation.
However, Zn supplementations are not always without adverse outcome or failures in conditions which
are relevant to COVID-19 adverse events and frequently observed in elderly, e.g., sickle cell disease,
chronic kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) (15,20-23).
We hypothesized, if Zn levels would be playing the supposed protective role in the COVID-19
pandemic, the COVID-19 mortality (and infections) would closely but negatively covary with the Zn
sufficiency (diet and supplementation) estimates of different socially similar populations. We
endeavored to assess the null hypothesis that Zn sufficiency/levels are not associated with COVID-19
mortality in socially similar populations. For this, socially similar European populations at a similar stage
of the pandemic, with higher HAQ Index, Life expectancy, Median age (24,25), similar confounders (2630) but closely graded different Zn sufficiency/deficiency levels (14), and differential COVID-19 impact
(24) offer an excellent opportunity to ascertain any potential protective role of Zn levels or its
augmentation on COVID-19.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:
Study populations and Zn sufficiency status: The COVID-19 incidences and mortality data (12
March to 26 June 2020) were collected (Table 1) from Worldometer (24). Twenty-three socially similar
European populations (Total 522.47 million) with similar confounders (26-30) but different Zn
sufficiency/deficiency levels (14), had registered 15.71% cases (1552 thousand cases) and 34.2%
deaths (173 thousand deaths) of the total global and more importantly at a similar stage of the
pandemic were analyzed for correlation. Pandemic stage-matched data set of European Countries was
chosen (12 March to 26 June 2020; 1st wave of Infections) for comparison to minimize the biases that
may get introduced in the analysis due to differential timings of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2
(COVID-19) to populations, implementational issues regarding measures in place to minimize spread,
reporting lag, etc.

Statistical analysis: All basic statistical analyses including correlation (Pearson’s) and regression
analysis were performed in Microsoft Excel. COVID-19 mortality and incidence, without applying extra
exclusion/inclusion criterion of the risk factors or supposed confounders (e.g., age, sex, age
distribution, comorbidities, populations’ density, etc.), were assessed for correlation with populations’
Zn sufficiency as done previously (26, 29). Interim case fatality ratio (i-CFR) for the populations/groups
were calculated as ‘(reported deaths/reported cases)*100. P-value <0.05 is referred to as statistically
significant.
Epidemiological Map display and required color manipulation: Global maps showing country-wise
Zn-levels as well as COVID-19 incidence and deaths are adapted from [25]. Color scheme variations in
maps were performed using ‘Inkscape’.
RESULTS:
When we analyze the COVID-19 incidences and mortality data (12 March to 26 June 2020) of twentythree socially similar European populations (Total 522.47 million) with similar confounders (26-30), but
different Zn sufficiency/deficiency levels (14) accounting for 15.71% cases (1552 thousand cases) and
34.2% deaths (173 thousand deaths) of the total global for correlation (Pearson’s) and perform
regression analysis without additional exclusion/inclusion criterion of supposed risk factors or
confounders (e.g., age, sex, age distribution, comorbidities, populations’ density, etc.) some interesting
observations were made:
1. Globally COVID-19 mortality rates positively covary with Zinc sufficiency levels: Zinc
sufficiency/deficiency levels vary across the globe (Supp. Fig. 1). Generally, differential COVID-19
mortality rates had been observed among countries. The European and North American countries
with higher HAQ Index, Life expectancy, Median age (24, 25) coming out as the worst affected.
Previously, Trained-immunity (REFs in 26, 27), BCG vaccination (28), vitamin D (29), Zinc
deficiency (30) had been associated with reduced COVID-19 mortality using early-stage
pandemic data (26-30). They had also attracted criticism for the inappropriateness of the data set,
inclusion/exclusion criteria, non-matched pandemic stages among countries, and more
importantly the loss of association by mid- or post-peak-of-infections (REFs in 25, 27, 29, 31).
Globally the populations were exposed to COVID-19 at different time points and had differences
concerning their lifestyles, social structures, preventive measures in place, and access to medical
facilities. So, the supposed associations drawn from them could be tenuous due to disparate data
sets. To arrive at more dependable conclusions, when pandemic phase-matched (Supp. Fig. 2),
populations with comparable confounders (26,28,29,31) were analyzed the COVID-19 mortality

rate in socially similar populations (Boxed North America and European Union NA and EU) were
found to strongly associate with their Zinc sufficiency (Supp. Fig 1; time-series graphics available
at reference 25). Incidentally, European, North American, and South American countries reporting
high mortality have been the high Zinc sufficiency countries.

2. Zinc sufficiency strongly and significantly correlated with COVID-19 mortality in socially
similar countries: The Zinc sufficiency in twenty-three socially similar European populations (Fig
1A, Table 1) positively associated with COVID-19 mortality and infection rates (Fig. 1B-C). The
mortality and infections covaried exponentially with Zn sufficiency (Fig. 1D-E). Above >92.5% Zn
sufficiency, the populations experienced up to 9X higher deaths (Fig. 1D). Pearson’s correlation
for the most synchronized period of infections and response (26 April to 26 June, Supp. Fig. 2)
was strong [Table 2, Deaths per million: r(23)= 0.7455–0.6849, p<0.0003; Cases per million:
r(23)= 0.8084–0.7629, p<0.00002]. Even the division of countries using >93.7% sufficiency cutoff,
indicated high mortality (5.79 to 2.66X) and incidences (4.5 to 2.3-fold) in High Zn sufficiency
populations (n=12) as compared to Low sufficiency (n=11). Some of the outlier populations that
fared extremely well and displayed quite low mortality among the higher Zn sufficiency countries,
e.g., Iceland, Finland, Norway, Denmark, also happen to have higher levels of ‘trained immunity’
and serum ‘vitamin D’ levels - two other protective variables proposed earlier (26, 27, 29).

3. Higher Zn sufficient socially similar countries/populations consistently reported higher
COVID-19 case fatality rates (CFRs) and incidence rates: The CFRs of different sufficiency
population groups, i.e., high (>93.7%, 12 countries) vs low (<93.7% 11 countries) had been
essentially different and showing decline post-peak-of-infections, i.e, 12 May (Fig. 1F) possibly
indicative of a more uniform reporting in later stages or progressive increase in protected
population but the relative change in the CFR decrease had been lower for the higher sufficiency
countries and the gap had consistently increased during the period (about 16% on 26 June that
become 30 % by 26 Aug 2020) (Fig. 1G).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:
Overall a general positive correlation of COVID-19 mortality and cases with Zn sufficiency levels was
observed during the 1st wave of infections, which sustained till the flattening of the curves.
Nevertheless, comparison of socially similar’ populations/countries at similar phase/stages of the
pandemic with comparable potential confounders, closely graded Zn sufficiency levels of study
populations that globally accounted for 34.2% mortality (173 thousand deaths) gives confidence to the

observations made. The surprisingly strong association between Zn sufficiency of socially similar study
populations with COVID-19 mortality and incidences for the whole study duration even stronger than
those being hotly discussed, debated and evaluated in clinical trials (28, 29, 31), warrants thorough
investigation.
Zinc bioavailability reduction during infections has been recognized as a routine part of ‘nutritional
immunity’ and has been comprehensively reviewed (1, 16, 19, 32). The drop in serum Zn levels is
primarily attributed to the proinflammatory cytokine-mediated alteration in the expression of hepatic Zn
transporter proteins during the acute phase of inflammation through squelching of serum Zn coming
from the diet (33). The cell-mediated Zn restrictions, reallocation, and mobilization (primarily mediated
by ZIP family of transporters, e.g., ZIP8 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (34), as well as extracellular Zn
sequestration (primarily mediated by S100 family of proteins, e.g., calprotectin, psoriasin, calgranulin,
etc.) is supposed to be part of an elaborate intricate immune mechanism to both starve of and/or
intoxicate pathogen with this key element as per differential need (REFs in 1, 2, 18, 19). Calprotectin,
an S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer, seems to be a key player in immune regulation through its ability to
chelate Zn and other metal ions (1, 35) and also serve as a damage-associated molecular pattern and
a ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (36). It can account for >40% of cytoplasmic proteins in
neutrophils during infection (37). In vitro studies have shown an important role of calprotectin in
inhibiting the growth of the pathogens while the supplementation of Zn has been shown to revert the
calprotectin-mediated growth inhibition (38-40). Here the Zn starvation strategy could primarily interfere
with the Zn-dependent infection process and replication while the intoxication could help the generation
of ROS in a localized manner for effective pathogen incapacitation and elimination (REFs in 1, 2, 32).
The existing pieces of evidence point to the mobilization of Zn during infection as a measure to not only
limit its availability to invading pathogens but also prime immune cells to intoxicate pathogens.
Systematic reviews of Zinc supplementation studies had shown a significant reduction of diarrhea
incidents and the associated deaths in Zinc deficient children (REFs in 41-43). It now forms a part of
global diarrhea control measures. Several published studies using a small group of individuals/patients
do indicate a benefit of Zn supplementation in other diseases as well including pneumonia and lower
respiratory tract infections relevant to COVID-19 (REFs in 41). However, the systematic reviews and
meta-analysis of the previous studies could not support the supposed positive influence of Zn
supplementation on the prevention and treatment of different diseases when Zn sufficient individuals
were also included in studies (REFs in 41,43). Though Zn sufficiency promotes the well-being and
integrity of respiratory cells during lung inflammation and protects them from injury arising from
respiratory tract infections (RTI) and decrease the incidence of infections by regulating immune
functions and response (44), the ability of zinc supplementation to help reduce the infection, severity or

treatment of lower RTI (a comorbid condition in > 50% COVID-19 deaths) has not been unequivocally
supported in different Zn sufficiency patient populations. A Cochrane Systematic review that
summarized 73 studies of Zn supplementation performed in Zn-sufficient and deficient children (low
and middle-income countries) up to the age of 12 years did not find evidence for the reduction in RTI
(prevention) but indicated a negative effect on Cu status (42). However, when the same set of studies
additionally considered the Iron supplementation status a reduction in death risk ratio from RTI was
observed as per the studies summarized in the WHO document available in e-Library of Evidence for
Nutrition Actions (eLENA) [43]. Similarly, as per studies summarized in WHO guidelines for tuberculosis
patients, Zinc supplementation does not have desired beneficial effects on tuberculosis patients who
chronically have lower circulating Zn levels (45). A more recently updated meta-analysis of Zn
micronutrient supplementation also could not find augmentation of the tuberculosis therapy outcomes
as assessed at different time points (e.g., sputum‐culture or sputum‐smear positivity, chest x‐ray
clearance; death in HIV positive patients) (46). The findings of a ZINC trial, recently reported in JAMA,
that evaluated the effect of Zn supplementation on survival of HIV patients who have been also hit
hardly by the COVID-19 pandemic, were discerning (47). A detrimental effect of Zn supplementation on
the overall survival of study participants was observed. The study using a cohort of HIV-positive
alcoholic veterans endeavored to ascertain the effect of zinc supplementation on markers of mortality,
the risk of cardiovascular disease, the levels of inflammation and associated microbial translocation and
HIV disease progression, and finally concluded that among survivors the Zn supplementation did not
affect/improve the markers investigated in the study based upon its analysis of the 69% participants
who completed the 18-month study period. Surprisingly, a closer look at the cause of dropouts or the
deceased of the study provided in the supplementary table (eTable. ‘Causes of Death in the ZINC Trial
by Randomized Group’), provides a glaringly different narrative. It highlights a potentially serious
detrimental/negative impact of Zn supplementation on a section of the HIV-infected cohort. The Zinc
supplemented group in comparison to the control group had observed almost two-fold higher all-cause
mortality, i.e., 21/126 vs 12/128. If we remove the unknown cause of deaths from both groups the
deaths were about 3 times more frequent in the Zn supplemented group (19/126 vs 7/128). Distribution
of deaths in the Zn supplemented vs control group concerning COVID-19 relevant conditions (23) was
more surprising, e.g., HIV-related deaths:7/21 vs 2/12; overdose-related deaths 4/21 vs 1/12; deaths
from pneumonia: 3/21 vs 0/12; deaths from suicide: 2/21 vs 0/12; deaths from Thromboembolism: 1/21
vs 0/12.
Two notions that are supposedly further contributing to the increase in Zinc supplementation for
COVID-19 are, a) Zinc can block viral replication, b) patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms have lower
Zinc levels. It must be remembered here that the free Zinc levels required to achieve viral replication

inhibition in vivo are not possible without killing the host (12). During infections and fever as a result of
the natural ‘nutritional immunity’ response, the availability of cellular as well as the systemic Zn (from
circulation) is reduced to impede the growth of pathogens (1, 2, 19, 48). The redistribution of Zn from
circulation is part of a mechanism to limit the oxidative damage to peripheral tissues, away from
circulatory or other vital systems during infections, which may experience a transient or sustained
localized increase of oxidative radicals as a part of an immune response.
The variable(s) responsible for the observed association between Zn sufficiency and COVID-19
mortality remain undefined. We speculate that the increased mortality observed in high Zn sufficiency
populations could be contributed by the existing underlying conditions of altered genetic composition,
physiology, response to Zn supplementations/modulation in certain sections of the population [1522,49]. It would be making them prone to display characteristic COVID-19 adverse illness as a result of
increased oxygen radical generation or diminished oxidative stress handling system due to their
physiologies’ propensity to promote the pro-oxidant role of Zn on supplementation (2). It may be
pertinent here to mention that Zinc overdoses would have the potential to negatively affect the activity
of different Zn dependent antioxidative system components leading to oxidative stress and damage,
e.g., the R213G polymorphism in superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3), a key member of the extracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) neutralization system, found in 2-6 % of the population makes them
prone to oxidative stress promoted hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular infractions and
thrombosis

uncommon in the highly impacted aged population of the developed countries that are more receptive
to supplementation with or without a prescription (51).
Recently published metanalysis of drugs being prescribed worldwide as a standard of care and the
investigational drugs being evaluated in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment, starkly indicate that the
most promising drug for alleviating COVID-19 symptoms and decreasing the mortality had been such
corticosteroids alone (52,53) that also suppress the Zn levels (54-56) along with increasing levels of
oxidative damage protecting metallothioneins (57-58). A similar increase in metallothionein levels had
been reported for 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (59) as well, another potential protective variable for
COVID-19 (29, 60). This serum Zn level suppression property of the select corticosteroids is also
shared by steroid hormone estradiols which are naturally higher in females and youngs – two broad
groups that had also consistently displayed lower vulnerability to COVID-19 adverse events (23).
Whether these occurrences are coincidences or have mechanistic underpinnings only future
investigations would reveal.

In conclusion, the observations presented, though circumstantial, underscore the need to revisit
existing Zn supplementation guidelines for COVID-19 patients. Exploratory studies should be
undertaken to correctly identify different underlying comorbid conditions that could make certain Zn
supplemented individuals prone to COVID-19 mortality. The outcomes could help devise more thorough
and comprehensive Zn supplementation practices for minimizing COVID-19 mortality among the
vulnerable.

higher Zn sufficiency. (B) The mortality per million population in socially similar EU and NA countries
and similar stage of pandemic strongly covary (higher sufficiency- higher deaths). For analysis of
European nations see the main manuscript. (C) Cases per million across countries. Images adapted
