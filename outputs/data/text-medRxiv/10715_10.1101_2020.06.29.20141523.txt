Abstract
Italy was the first Western country to be seriously affected by COVID-19, and the first to
implement drastic measures, which have successfully curtailed the epidemic. To understand
which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimate change points in COVID-19
dynamics from official Italian data. We find excellent correlation between nationwide lockdown
and the epidemic peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we find a change point in mid April,
which does not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions.
Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlate well with local distribution of free face
masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions
showed no change point during April. We speculate that widespread use of face masks and other
protective means has contributed substantially to keeping the number of new Italian COVID-19
cases under control in spite of society turning towards a new normality.

Introduction
The COVID-19 disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the
globe since its outbreak in China, and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020.
After the first severe patient was brought to the hospital of Codogno, Italy on February 20,
2020, and subsequently tested positive for COVID-19, a rapidly increasing number of patients
have been identified, initially in Northern Italy and later in the rest of the country and Europe.
Italy is one of the most affected European country, with ∼250.000 confirmed cases and nearly
35.000 COVID-19 related deaths, and was the first to implement drastic contain measures. The
imposed restrictions, culminating with complete lockdowns, have turned out to be effective in
controlling the epidemic in Italy; the number of new daily cases peaked in late March 2020 at
∼6000 and declined to ∼200 − 300 by early June. The limitations in activities were followed by
milder orders and direct invitations to behavioural change, such as distribution of face masks
accompanied by their mandatory use, first in the most hit regions and later nationwide. During
the month of May 2020, the country reopened many activities without compromising the decay
in the number of newly infected individuals. Analyzing the Italian data carefully may therefore
provide important insights into the epidemiology of COVID-19, and in particular to investigate
if, how and which limitations in activities and other actions affected the disease dynamics in
Italy.

Effective measures slow diffusion of the disease. By identifying such change points in COVID19 spreading [1], it is therefore possible to associate interventions that were able to modify
the course of the epidemic without assuming any effect a priori. Further, such an approach
may reveal wether e.g. reopening of society lead to changes in disease dynamics, or could hint
at change points apparently unrelated to regulations that deserve further investigations. To
find such change points, it is advantageous to use relatively simple mathematical models of
infectious diseases, which can be fitted to data with a minimum number of assumptions on model
parameters [1–3]. In our setting, a SIQR (susceptible – infectious – quarantined – recovered)
model [4] is appropriate. In this model, identified infected individuals (cases) may be isolated,
entering the “quarantined” subpopulation Q, reflecting the situation in Italy.
Preferably, one would like to have control group consisting of a matched population, but
where no interventions were imposed, in order to evaluate the effects of a given intervention.
Here we take of advantage of the fact among demographically similar Italian regions, some
introduced specific regional containment measures at different times, whereas others did not
impose any limitations beyond the nationwide rules. Due to the nationwide lockdown from
March 11 to May 4, each region was basically isolated from the rest of the country during
this period. We show that the model fits Italian national and regional data for the COVID-19
disease very well, and identifies change points that correlate well with national and regional
containment measures, including lockdowns and widespread face mask use.

Results
To identify change points in COVID-19 dynamics in Italy, we allow the infection rate β in the
SIQR model to be a piecewise constant function of time, thus modelling how contain measures
may affect the rate of COVID-19 transmission. The assumption of piecewise constant β is
equivalent to the number of infectious individuals I(t) being a piecewise exponential function
(under the assumption that most of the population is susceptible, S ≈ N , see Methods). Under
the assumptions of the model, the daily number of new cases is then ηI(t), where η models the
average rate with which infectious individuals become tested and quarantined, and eventually
appear in the official statistics (see Methods). Hence, the log-transformed daily number of
new cases is piecewise linear, allowing us to perform piecewise-linear (“segmented”) statistical
modelling. This fact underlies our data analysis and conclusions. We estimate both the time
points (change points, Ti ) where the disease dynamics changes and the values of the exponential
growth/decay rate ρ = ρi in the intervals (Ti−1 , Ti ] with T0 = 0 (Feb. 24, 2020) and Tmax = 146
(July 19, 2020; last data point). Importantly, these estimates do not depend on the value of η
(see Methods).
We obtained an good fit to the Italian data of daily COVID-19 cases (Fig. 1). The data
analysis identified four change-points, separating intervals with exponential growth or decay
clearly seen also in the raw data (straight lines in Fig. 1). We confront these change points to
public interventions by assuming a delay from a change in the transmission rate to appearance in
the official data, effectively shifting the change point backwards in time. This approach provides
reasonable estimates of changes in disease dynamics [5]. We consider a 5-days delay from
infection to the onset of symptoms [6, 7], followed by a variable delay from onset of symptoms
to registration. This latter delay varied during the epidemic ranging 2-6 days according to the
data from Italian health authorities, which grouped the data and provided the median delay for
10-days intervals [8]. Thus, the total delay from time-of-infection to observation, corresponding

to the shift of change points when confronting with public interventions, is between 7 and 11
days.
The first change point was estimated to fall on March 7, 2020 (95% C.I. [March 3, March
11]). We note that the number of tests increased rapidly during the first weeks following the
confirmation of the first Italian COVID-19 case on February 22, 2020, and the initial rapid rise
might be due to testing of a pool of already infected individuals. Further, this first change point
is highly dependent on a relatively few number of data points in late February – early March.
Because of the related uncertainties we do not speculate further on any possible underlying
cause.
The second change points was estimated to fall on March 20, 2020 (95% C.I. [March 18,
March 23]), following which the growth rate became negative. For the period March 11 – 20,
the median delay between onset of symptoms and reporting was 5 days [8], which should be
added to the 5 days of incubation time. Thus, the change point should be compared with
interventions occurring around March 10. This date is in excellent agreement with the lockdown
of the Northern regions on March 8, 2020, which was followed by complete lockdown of Italy
on March 11. A third change point was found at April 22, 2020 (95% C.I. [April 14, April 30])
where the decay was further accelerated. This latter change point is apparently not related

COVID-19 cases, corresponding to Fig. 1B. For Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Tuscany and

to any specific nationwide containment measures. Since early June (change point June 7) the
number of cases is nearly constant. We speculated that regional interventions might underlie
the change in dynamics seen in April and proceeded by analyzing the data in the eight hardest
hit Italian regions.
We found that all regions had a change point in late March (for Lombardy and Marche we
were able to identify two, similar to what we found for the national data, but we note that
the early change point depends on very few data points in late February – early March), and
that Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Tuscany and Liguria had another change point in
mid-to-late April. In spite of reopening of society from May 4, the daily number of new cases
continued to decline until early June where, in most regions, the number of new cases became so
low that small fluctuations and local hotspots make the analysis less reliable. We note that there
is a recent increase in the number of cases in Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, which is somewhat
worrying.
Lombardy, the worst hit Italian region, showed slight reduction in the growth rate from the
change point on March 3 (95% C.I. [February 29, March 7]). The number of daily cases peaked
in late March corresponding to the change point identified on March 19 (95% C.I. [March 16,
March 22]). Since the peak a remarkable constant exponential decline is observed. Shifting the
identified change point on March 19 ten days backwards corresponds very well to date of the
lockdown of Lombardy on March 8, 2020. Following the lockdown and nationwide closure of all

non-essential work places on March 22, Lombardy introduced mandatory face mask use on April
4, 2020 [9]. We note that in late March – early April, the regional health care system was close
to a collapse, and the data may therefore be unreliable near the peak due e.g. reduced testing
capacity or longer-than-normal reporting delays, making it difficult to distinguish between the
different containment measures. Reopening of society has not modified the dynamics of the
epidemic in Lombardy, which – as remarked above – shows sustained exponential decay since
mid-to-late March 2020.
For Veneto, the first identified change point fell on March 21 (95% C.I. [March 17, March
24]), reflecting that the number of daily new cases stabilized at ∼400 with a small decline until
the second change point found at April 21 (95% C.I. [April 14, April 28]). The number of new
cases then showed a marked exponential decline. As for Lombardy, the lockdown on March
8 correspond well to the first change point considering a 10 days delay. During the period
April 10–19, the median delay from onset-of-symptoms to reporting was 4 days [8], corresponding
to a 9 days shift of the change point. The second identified change point thus correlates well
with the mandatory use of face masks from April 14 in Veneto [10].
For Tuscany we found a similar pattern with a near-constant plateau during late March –
early April followed by exponential decline. The corresponding latter change point was April
16 (95% C.I. [April 8, April 24]). Shifting this date 9 days backwards in time, we find good
temporal correlation with the regional order of April 6, 2020, regarding the distribution of face
masks in Tuscany from April 7, anticipating mandatory use in single municipalities once the
distribution had completed, and from April 20 in the entire Region [11].
Piedmont showed a slightly increasing number of daily cases in late March – early April until
the change point on April 18 (95% C.I. [April 12, April 25]). This change point correlates well
with the introduction of a series of strict measures in Piedmont, including the ban of gatherings
of more than two persons, from April 14 [13]. Piedmont did not require face masks until May 4,
2020, but the regional government announced on April 15 that masks would become mandatory
and started their distribution soon after (from April 25, [12]).
For Emilia-Romagna and Liguria the change points were, respectively, April 28 (95% C.I.
[April 19, May 6]) and April 22 (95% C.I. [April 5, May 9]). Note the large uncertainty for Liguria.
These change points should be shifted 9-10 days backwards in time [8], which provides good
correlation with distribution of free face masks. For example, in the capital of Emilia-Romagna,
Bologna, distribution of face masks started April 14 [14], and in Liguria distribution occurred
from April 20 [15].
The remaining two regions Marche and Lazio correspond to the “control group” in this
observational study. Neither distributed free face masks, nor required their mandatory use
before the nationwide order on May 4. No other particular interventions were ordered in Marche
or Lazio to contain COVID-19 spreading.
For Marche, we identified an early change point as mentioned above, and a second change
point on March 19 (95% C.I. [March 17, March 22]) corresponding to the peak in the data. As
for the other regions, this change point correlates well with the lockdown on March 11. A third
change point was found on May 17 (95% C.I. [March 12, March 21]), followed by another on
May 27 (95% C.I. [March 23, March 30]). In late May, the number of cases in Marche fell below
∼10, making the data less reliable for predicting overall dynamics. Importantly, we found no
evidence of a change point during April, where the daily number of new cases showed steady
exponential decay. The analysis of the data from Lazio revealed a change point on March 22
(95% C.I. [March 20, March 23]), which corresponds very well to the lockdown on March 11.

A second change point was identified to fall on June 19 (95% C.I. [June 13, June 24]). As for
Marche, no change point was found for the month of April.
The relevance of the above change points for fitting the data was found following model
selection using ANOVA, AIC and BIC. We performed additional tests (Davies’ test [16]) against
the null-hypothesis of no change in ρ from the peak to mid May, i.e., during March 22 – May 16.
These tests confirmed that the change in slope was significant for Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont,
Tuscany, Veneto (all p < 0.001), and Liguria (p = 0.015), whereas there was no evidence for
a change of slope during this period for Lazio (p = 0.065), Lombardy (p = 0.88) or Marche
(p = 1).

Discussion and Conclusion
The importance of face mask use for controlling COVID-19 by reducing transmission from
asymptomatic individuals during the reopening of societies has been widely claimed [17–21].
The Italian data provide an opportunity to investigate whether the dynamics of the epidemic
had any correlation with the use of face masks, since demographically similar regions behaved
differently regarding orders and distributions promoting face masks use.
To study the dynamics of COVID-19, we estimated change points [1]. We found a change
point reflecting the peak in the number of new cases for all eight regions that readily explain
the change point for the national data. Temporally, these change points correlate well with the
lockdown imposed on March 8 – 11 depending on the region. Our analysis revealed that five of
the eight analyzed regions showed change points during April that correlate temporally well with
additional general containment measures (Piedmont), the introduction of mandatory face mask
use (Veneto and Tuscany) and/or distribution of free face masks (Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna)
We considered alternative explanations for the acceleration of the decline of new cases seen
in late April. The number of COVID-19 tests did not decline in correspondence to the identified
change point, and the fraction of positive tests showed an acceleration in the decline similar
to the decline seen in the number of new daily cases (Supplementary Fig. S1). Mobility data
(https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/; Supplementary Fig. S2) showed, if anything,
increased activity in late compared to early April, excluding that reduced activity underlie the
change. In contrast, the lockdown introduced in early March 2020 correlate with a marked drop
of ∼75% in mobility in Italy compared to pre-lockdown. The weather was mild and dry in April
in Italy (https://www.3bmeteo.com), with little variation in temperature during the month.
Virtually no rain fell during the entire month until April 27. Thus, no abrupt change in weather
was seen around mid-April, which might have been the cause of the change in dynamics. In
summary, no obvious alternative explanations for the acceleration of the end of the epidemic
were found.
Summarizing, this observational study showed good temporal correlation between a series
of containment measures and changes in COVID-19 dynamics in Italy. Based on the excellent
correspondence with estimated change points, we speculate that lockdowns were the main
cause in halting the spreading of the disease, which lead to the peak in new cases seen in late
March. Analyzing regional data, we were able to distinguish change points for each region that
correspond well to the introduction of face mask distributions or orders in the individual regions.
The reopening of society in May did not lead to any change in the decay rate (Figs. 1 and
2). Our results thus lend further support to the importance of face mask use for controlling
COVID-19.

Methods
We use a SIQR model [4] to describe COVID-19 dynamics in Italy, motivating our statistical
analysis described below. Since we are fitting the official number of new daily cases, we unite
the Q and R compartments in a “cases” compartment C = Q + R. The model equations are
dS
dt
dI
dt
dC
dt

= −βSI/N,

(1)

= βSI/N − (α + η)I,

(2)

= ηI,

(3)

where β is the rate of infection, η models the average rate with which infectious individuals
become tested and quarantined, and eventually appear in the official statistics, and α is the
rate with which unidentified infectious individuals recover or die from the disease. We do not
explicitly model the number of recovered or deceased non-identified COVID-19 patients, but
only the rate α with which these patient become non-infectious. Further, N is the total number
of individuals in the population, assumed constant since we are studying the early phase of
the epidemic. Note that S + I + C 6= N . To obtain such a conservation law, an additional
compartment RI that model recovered but non-identified patients could be added with dynamics
dRI /dt = αI.
Since there is evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted in the absence of symptoms [22–24],
we do not include an explicit exposed-but-noninfectious (E) state, i.e., we do not consider a
SEIQR model [25]. Further, from the Diamond Princess cruiseship and from the Italian village
Vo’ Euganeo, it has been found that ∼50% of COVID-19-positive individuals do not develop
symptoms [26, 27]. We assume that such positive but asymptomatic individuals can transmit
the disease, i.e., the I state includes both individuals that will not develop symptoms, cases
that did not develop symptoms yet, and symptomatic patient that still have not been tested
positive and isolated.
In spite of the fact that ∼240,000 individuals have been found COVID-19 positive, and
possibly a few millions of unidentified cases have occurred, the total number of persons that have
had the infection constitute a relatively small fraction of the Italian population of ∼60 million.
Thus, it is a reasonable approximation that most of the population is still susceptible, S ≈ N ,
and hence, as well known, the number of infected individuals follows at any time exponential
growth or decay, unless parameters change.
To identify change points, we allow β to be a piecewise constant function of time, thus
modelling how contain measures may affect the rate of COVID-19 transmission. We estimate
both the time points (change points, Ti ) where β changes and the values of β = βi in the intervals
(Ti−1 , Ti ] with T0 = 0 (Feb. 24, 2020) and Tmax = 122 (July 19, 2020; last data point). The
assumption of piecewise constant β is equivalent to I(t) being a piecewise exponential function
(under the assumption S ≈ N ) with piecewise constant growth rate ρi = βi − (α + η). Since
dC/dt in proportional to I, also the number of new daily cases will be a piecewise exponential
function, and hence the log-transformed daily increase in the number of cases, log(dC/dt), will
be a piecewise linear function. This fact underlies our data analysis and conclusions.
We log-transform the number of newly daily cases and fit piecewise linear (“segmented”)
statistical models to the data using the segmented package [28] in R [29], which provides
estimates for Ti and ρi . The number of change points was increased subsequently, and model

selection was performed using ANOVA, AIC and BIC in order to obtain a parsimonious model.
Residuals were verified graphically to be symmetrically distributed around zero, homoscedastic,
and show no sign of autocorrelation. Davies’ test for ”no change in slope” was applied as
indicated in the test for confirming the model selection results regarding change points in April –
early May. p-values below 0.05 were considered significant.
