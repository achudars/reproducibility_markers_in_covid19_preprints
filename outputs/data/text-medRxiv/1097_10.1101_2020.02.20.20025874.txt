Abstract
The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019nCoV) threatens global health, given serious cause for concern. SARS-CoV-2 is a
human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been
confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased
transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals
without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify
these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method
for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal
coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction
time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected
samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.

Introduction
In December 2019, the first case of cluster unidentified pneumonia was found in Wuhan, named 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), a beta subtype, highly homologous with SARS(1). As of February 18, 2020, there were in total 75,201 confirmed
cases worldwide. With the rapid spreading speed of R0 3.28, there is a heavy pres-

sure for hospital assistant diagnosis, as some infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others(2). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop
a diagnostic method that is sensitive, accurate, rapid and low-cost to screen infected
individuals, facilitate proper isolation and help controlling the disease spread.
For RNA virus infections, especially acute respiratory infection, probe coupled
RT-qPCR from respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses (39). This method has been widely used by Center for Disease Control and Prevention and other relevant departments worldwide. Recently RT-qPCR based methods
were developed and applied worldwide by multiple research and disease control centers (10). However, RT-qPCR has many limitations such as the need for high purity
samples and the access to expensive laboratory instruments, as well as requiring long
reaction times (at least 2 h). In addition, RT-qPCR needs trained personnel and sophisticated facilities for sample processing. These disadvantages limit its practical application in many cases, and thus can delay the required rapid prescription and administration of antiviral agents to patients.
Loop -mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technology that provides
nucleic acid amplification in a short time using 4 to 6 specially designed primers and
a DNA polymerase with chain displacement activity (Bst) under a constant temperature (60-65 )(11, 12). Particularly relevant for this application, is that LAMP can be
combined with reverse transcription (i.e. RT-LAMP), were both reverse transcription
and amplification occur simultaneously allowing the direct detection of RNA (13-17).
This system, can be coupled with a pH indicator present in the reaction mix allowing
readout of the amplification reaction by change in color (18). Therefore, LAMP has
the potential to offer an easy diagnostic test where the result could be directly observe
the color change with the naked eye.
The present study describes an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19), for rapid colorimetric detection of
2019-Novel Coronavirus.

Materials and Methods
Clinical samples
Respiratory samples were obtained from patients sent to the Shenyang CDC and tested by the RT-qPCR kit. RNA was further diluted for iLACO development and evaluation.
RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from clinic samples with COVID-19 virus infection during the
epidemic in Shenyang in 2020 with the Thermo nuclear acid extraction workstation in
the P3 laboratory of CDC Shenyang. Before the experiment, the concentration
of virus RNA sample was measured with Qubit 3.0 (Thermo Fisher).
Reverse Transcription
COVID-19 virus RNA was reverse transcribed using random primer with SuperScript® III Reverse Transcriptase First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA).
The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 50°C for 1 h. The cDNA obtained was used as the detection sample of RT-LAMP reaction as well.
Real-time reverse-transcription PCR
Two kits were used in parallel to validate the positive samples (BGI and Biotech &
Biomedicine Science

（Shenyang）). Briefly, a 20 µl reaction volume containing 5μl

RNA template, 13 μl master mix, 2 μl primer and probe mix. The reverse transcription reaction was performed at 50° for 5 minutes, the initial denaturation was 94° for
2 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94° for 5s and annealing at 55° for 10s. The
PCR apparatus used in this research were CFX96 TouchTM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system.

iLACO development
To develop the iLACO, we first use the commercialized WarmStart master mix kit
from NEB combined with 10 panel of designed primers. A 20 µl reaction contained
10µl WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix, 2µl primer mix, 1µl
RNA/cDNA sample as positive reaction and 7µl DEPC-treated water. For the negative control group, we replaced the template RNA/cDNA with DEPC-treated water.
Mixed reactions were all performed in PCR thermo-cycler or water bath incubation at
65 °C for 20-40 minutes. Positive reactions resulted in a color change of phenol red
pH indicator from pink to yellow due to decreased pH in the presence of extensive
DNA polymerase activity. However, the negative reaction still kept pink. Later we
prepared all the solutions with individual components to optimize the reaction solution, also with different dyes for color judgement sensitivity test.
Ethical statement
Sample collection and analysis of samples were approved by the local CDC. The internal use of samples was agreed under the medial and ethical rules of each participating individuals.

Primer design and analysis
RT-LAMP primers were designed by the online software Primer Explorer V5
(http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html). For the primer sets, we used the online
tool Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primerblast/index.cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome) (19) to detect whether the primer sequence
is specific to the human genome and retain the primers that all 3 pairs primers are
specific. Then compare the primer region sequence with other viruses' genome by the
online tool BLAST
(https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastn&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSe
arch&LINK_LOC=blasthome)(20) to calculate the homology.

The final set of primers used in this research for iLACO are shown in Table 1. The
concentration of each primer in primer mix were as followed: 0.2 µM of each outer
primer (F3 and B3), 1.6 µM of each inner primer (FIP and BIP), 0.4 µM of each loop
primer(LF and LB)(21).

Results
Primer region mapping
We selected a region of the ORF1ab as target region that is currently used for RTqPCR detection approaches (Fig. 1A), and used the online software Primer Explorer
V5 (http://primerexplorer.jp/lampv5e/index.html) to design the RT-LAMP primers.
After the specificity analysis, we retained one primer set with several pairs of loop
primers (Table 1, see Materilas and Methods for details); their genomic locations on
the virus genome can be found in Fig.1B (see also Table 1). To assure the primer
specificity, we compared their sequences with other viruses genome (include 7 similar
coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses, and 2 other coronaviruses)(22) by BLAST and
found that the sequences were not similar to most viruses’ sequences we have chosen
(Fig. 1C).

Establishment and optimization of iLACO
We used one SARS-CoV-2 positive patient respiratory RNA sample validated by RTqPCR to set up the iLACO assay. We confirmed that after 20 minutes of incubation in
a thermoblock, using the designed RT-LAMP primers the targeted gene was successfully amplified and a color change was observed in the reaction tubes. Specifically, a
change in color from pink to light yellow indicated a positive reaction while negative
reactions retained a pink color.
To optimize of RT-LAMP reaction, we used five group of primers with variable
LB oligos 1-5 (Table 1). We evaluated their ability to produce an effective amplifica-

tion of both RNA and cDNA samples with 15 minutes or 20 minutes of incubation
time

（Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). After the incubation, in addition to the colorimetric

change, a ladder of DNA with increasing size was observed with on an agarose gel
confirming the expected DNA amplification (Fig. 2C). The 5 sets of primers were
further tested for efficiency and the primer group 4 (containing LB4) was chosen for
further optimization, which showed the best sensitivity (data not shown). We also optimized the reaction temperature to 65° degree, as we did not observe any positive
signal using the recommended 72° degree incubation previously used for ZIKA virus detection by LAMP assay(21). iLACO showed similar performance when we
compared the samples from SARS-CoV-2 RNA or cDNA, indicating the one-step
isothermal amplification is sufficient and separated step for reverse transcription is
not necessary.
In order to optimize the potential usage for field-based or bed-based detections,
we checked the efficiency of iLACO in 1.5 ml tubes incubated with water bath or incubator. Twenty minutes of reaction is sufficient to detect the signal (Fig. 2D). We
notice the signal is stronger compared with incubation using a thermocycler commonly used for PCR . The longer incubation time caused the water drops on the top lid of
the tube. To avoid this, we added few drops of mineral oil after adding all the required
solutions. This set up can be further optimised by using micro Pasteur Pipettes coupled with thermo cups for processing.

Assay sensitivity compared with RT-qPCR
To check the detection limit of iLACO, we prepared multiple reactions containing
serial dilutions of synthesized ORF1ab gene (from 1,000,000 to 10 copies). As shown
in Figure 3, iLACO is very sensitive, and as low as 10 copies of ORF1ab gene were
detected successfully (1:100000 dilution in Fig. 3A). Further, we compared iLACO
with RT-qPCR assay with the diluted RNA sample from patient number 200202(10
times dilution, SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration around 17 copies/ µl).. We observed

the iLACO reaction time correlating well with RT-qPCR cycles. ie. 37 minutes color
turning point correlated with 37 cycles (Fig. 3B and C). However, the 20 µl volume
reaction time in 1.5 ml tubes incubated on wather bath are much fastercompared to
RT-qPCR or samples processedin 0.2 ml tubes in PCR thermocycler, partially due to
the increased heating volume and even surrounding temperature.

Detection of amplified product by alternative methods
To further expand the iLACO detection capability, we also checked the UV or Blue
light stimulated fluorescence signal. We added SYBR green dye into the reaction mix
prior to adding the sample. After 20 minutes incubation in 65 degree, the signal was
observed with Gel imaging system (Fig. 4A). SYBR green in positive reactions was
observed clearly in positive reaction. We also chose a new type of nucleic acid dye
GeneFinderTM, which has enhanced fluorescent signal and sensitivity. By exposing
under Blue light, green fluorescence was observed clearly with naked eye in the positive reaction, whereas it remained original pink in the negative control (Fig. 4B).

Evaluation of the iLACO assay using clinical samples
Finally, we evaluated the iLACO with total 43 samples initially diagnosed with RTqPCR during the epidemic in Shenyang in 2020. Results showed that 97.6% (42/43)
of samples validated by qPT-PCR showed consistent signal after 40 min incubation
with 2 µl sample loading(RNA concentration range 0.2-47 ng/µl). One sample kept
unchanged color after 50 minutes, indicating the low dose of virus would cause false
negative or spontaneous negative signal. To confirm this, we repeated this sample
multiple times with random positive signal, confirming that this samples was close to
the detection threshold using 2µl. Currently most the RT-qPCR reactions in China for
SARS-CoV-2 test use 5 µl sample input. We thereby checked whether increasing the
used sample volume would facilitate the detection. However, increasing the volume

of the loaded sample to 5 µl RNA sample lead to variable results. This is most likely
due to the presence of Tris or EDTA in the RNA dilution buffer when automatic RNA
extraction workstation is used. This could be optimized by adjusting the concentration
of used buffers. We recommend to use always a positive and a negative control sample resuspended in the same buffers used for patient RNA isolation.
Discussion
The most popular methods for RNA virus detection so far are based on RT-PCR
and/or RT-qPCR; while these methods only take a run time of 2-3 hours, they require
special experimental apparatus, controlled working environment and well-trained personnel, which are often lacking in massive virus outbreaks such as the SARS or
COVID-19. In this research, we developed an optimized iLACO that can rapid and
sensitively detect COVID-19 virus RNA or cDNA samples based on LAMP isothermal amplification. The reaction time takes 20-30 minutes at 65°C. The result showed
that by optimizing the concentration of primers, the total reaction time would be
shorter for high dose virus carriers. iLACO detection method could not only detect
the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus, but also worked on the cDNA samples.
The use of iLACO will facilitate the widely application of virus detection test,
especially in developing countries with limited facilities, and when compared with
other assays that are laborious, costly, and time-consuming(23).
Currently, there is a lack of specific drugs for the treatment of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, so the early detection and following treatment is essential to control the spread of the disease. Therefore the detection of COVID-19 is of
vital importance. The first version of iLACO with six primers could specifically identify eight distinct regions of the ORF1ab target. Our blast analysis suggest that the
highly specific primer set design have a low chance for unspecific amplifications
(false positives).
