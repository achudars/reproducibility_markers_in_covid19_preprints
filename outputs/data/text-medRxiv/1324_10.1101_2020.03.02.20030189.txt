Summary
Background
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in
infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have
not been fully demonstrated.

Methods
A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial
plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total
antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of
antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed.

Results
Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173),
82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not
seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected.
The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time
of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients
in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for
Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA
decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during
days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the
sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase
of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently
associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006).

Conclusions
The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of

serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Since early December of 2019 and up to February 24, 2020, over 79, 000 cases of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infection, with over 2, 600 death cases infection have been reported in 26 countries
with a majority of occurrences in China.1 The World Health Organization declared a
public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. Public health
authorities around the world react promptly to prevent further spread of the virus.
According to recent reports, most of COVID-19 patients have an incubation period of
3 to 7 days.2 Fever, cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms, whereas nasal
congestion, runny and diarrhea are only noted in a small part of the patients.3 Severe
cases might rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic
shock and difficult-to-tackle metabolic acidosis and bleeding and coagulation
dysfunction.4 It should be noted that some of COVID-19 patients only had mild atypical
symptoms initially, even for severe and critical cases.5 The chest computed
tomography features of COVID-19 patients were characterized by the ground-glass
opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing.6 For laboratory test, it was reported that over
80% of patients had lymphopenia, and most of patients had elevated C-reactive
protein.7 However, the above-mentioned clinical and laboratory characteristics are not
easily distinguishable from pneumonia induced by infection with other common
respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza virus, streptococcus pneumoniae and
mycoplasma pneumoniae.
The timely and accurate diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cornerstone of

the efforts to provide appropriated treatment for patients, to limit further spread of the
virus and ultimately to eliminate the virus from human society. Currently, viral RNA
detection by several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based technics is almost the
only way to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in practice. On the other
hand, RNA testing based on throat or nasopharyngeal swabs brought out negligible
false-negative risk.8 The reported positive rate varied for different swab specimens in
COVID-19 patients.

3,9

Many cases that were strongly epidemiologically linked to

SARS-CoV-2 exposure and with typical lung radiological findings remained RNA

negative in their upper respiratory tract samples. There are four potential reasons: 1)
the viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are much lower than that in lower
respiratory tract samples in COVID-19 patients;9 2) the releasing viral loads of patients
in different stage of infection varies with a wide range;10 3) the collection of high-quality
swab specimen requires skillful health-workers; and 4) PCR reagents from different
sources have high variance. Consequently, these problems lead to a noteworthy delay
of early diagnosis and following management and propose serious challenge to
providing timely life support treatment and preventive quarantine.
For many known pathogenic viruses, it has been a routine practice to make a
diagnosis of acute infection according to the serological findings for a long time.
Comparing to PCR, serological testing is advantageous with faster turn-around time,
high-throughput and less workload. However, the clinical value of antibodies largely
depends on the understanding of host antibody responses during infection. Given that
SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus, the antibody response in COVID-19 patients

remains largely unknown. To mitigate this knowledge gap, and to provide scientific
analysis on the benefit of antibody testing when used in combination with the current
RNA testing, this study investigates the dynamics of total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG
antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in serial blood samples collected from 173 confirmed
COVID-19 patients and provides discussion on the clinical value of antibody testing.
Methods
Patients
A confirmed COVID-19 case and the clinical classification was defined based on the
New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (4th edition) published
by the National Health Commission of China. This study enrolls a total of 173 cases of
COVID-19, where all patients were admitted to the Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital
between Jan 11 and Feb 9, 2020, and were willing to donate their blood samples. All
enrolled cases were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by use of real-time RTPCR (rRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. For all enrolled patients, the
date of illness onset, clinical classification, RNA testing results during the
hospitalization period, and the personal demographic information were obtained from
the clinical records. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical
Committee of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital (approval number 2020-0018).
Written informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient.
Antibody measurement
The total antibody (Ab), IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in plasma
samples were tested using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits supplied

by Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., China, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the ELISA for total antibodies detection was
developed based on double-antigens sandwich immunoassay (Ab-ELISA), using
mammalian cell expressed recombinant antigens contained the receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 as the immobilized and HRPconjugated antigen. The IgM μ-chain capture method (IgM-ELISA) was used to detect
the IgM antibodies, using the same HRP-conjugate RBD antigen as the Ab-ELISA. The
IgG antibodies were tested using indirect ELISA kit (IgG-ELISA) based on a
recombinant nucleoprotein antigen. The specificity of the assays for Ab, IgM and IgG
was determined as 99.1% (211/213), 98.6% (210/213) and 99.0% (195/197) by testing
of samples collected from healthy individuals before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Statistical analysis
For continue variables description, mean with standard deviation was used for normal
distribution data and median with interquartile range (IQR) was used for non-normal
distribution data. Cumulative seroconversion rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier
method. The association between antibody level and severity of illness were estimated
by generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with logit link function. All statistical
analysis was conducted by SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results
The characterization of patients
Among totally 368 cases of COVID-19 patients admitted in the hospital (before Feb 9,
2020), 173 patients of them (47%) were enrolled in the study (Table 1). All patients had
acute respiratory infection syndromes and/or abnormalities in chest CT images
accompanied by detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory sample since illness onset
for at least one time. The median age of the studied patients was 48 years (IQR, 3561 years) and 51.4% were females. There were 126 patients had clear epidemiological
travel/residence history in Wuhan (116) and other cities of Hubei province (10),
respectively (Table 1). Among them, 32 (18.5%) were in critical illness condition with
ARDS or oxygen saturation < 93% who required mechanical ventilation either
invasively or non-invasively, and the remaining 141 (81.5%) had mild to moderate
syndromes were in non-critical condition. By February 19, a total of 62 patients (35.8%,
54 were in non-critical group and 8 were in critical group) were recovered and
discharged from hospital and 2 (1.1%, both were in critical group) patients died with
underlying chronic disease.
Seroconversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients
A total of 535 plasma samples collected during the hospitalization period of the 173
patients were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The seroconversion rate for
Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173),
respectively (Table 1). Twelve patients who remained seronegative for Ab testing
possibly due to that their samples involved were all collected at the early stage of

illness (10 earlier than day 10, the other two on day 11 and 13 after onset). The
cumulative seroconversion curve showed that the rate for Ab and IgM reached 100%
around 1 month of illness day. The seroconversion was sequential appeared for Ab,
IgM and then IgG (Figure 1A). The median time to Ab, IgM and IgG seroconversion
was 11, 12 and 14 days, separately. One of two patients tested on the onset day was
seropositive. Overall, the seroconversion of Ab was significantly quicker than that of
IgM (p = 0.012) and IgG (p < 0.001), that possibly attributed to the double-antigen
sandwich form of the assay used which usually show much higher sensitivity than
capture assay (IgM) and indirect assay (IgG). Moreover, all isotypes of antibodies
against viral antigen, including IgM, IgA and IgG, can be detected by double-sandwich
based assay, which may also contribute to the superior performance of Ab test. In
comparisons of seroconversion rates of antibodies between critical and non-critical
patients, none of the three markers showed significant difference (Figure 1B, 1C and
ID, p > 0.05).
The diagnosis value of antibody assays for patients in different time after onset
We analyzed the detectability of RNA test and antibody assays according to the time
course since illness onset in the cohort. As the results shown in Figure 2 and Table 2,
in the early phase of illness within 7-day since onset, the RNA test had the highest
sensitivity of 66.7%, whereas the antibody assays only presented a positive rate of
38.3%. However, the sensitivity of Ab overtook that of RNA test since day 8 after onset
and reached over 90% across day 12 after onset (Figure 2). In samples from patients
during day 8-14 after onset, the sensitivities of Ab (89.6%), IgM (73.3%) and IgG

(54.1%) were all higher than that of RNA test (54.0%). Among samples from patients
in later phase (day 15-39 since onset), the sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG were
100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8%, respectively. In contrast, RNA was only detectable in 45.5%
of samples of day 15-39. Further analyses demonstrated that in patients with
undetectable RNA in their respiratory tract samples collected during day 1-3, day 4-7,
day 8-14 and day 15-39 since onset, there were 28.6% (2/7), 53.6% (15/28), 98.2%
(56/57) and 100% (30/30) had detectable antibody in total Ab assay, respectively
(Table 3). Whatever, combined use of the tests of RNA and Ab improved markedly the
sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis for COVID-19 patients in different phases (Table
2, Ab+RNA).
The dynamics of antibody levels with the progress and severity of disease
To investigate the dynamics of antibody level according disease course, the antibody
levels were expressed using the relative binding signals compared to the cutoff value
of each assay (S/CO). The longitudinal changes of antibody and RNA in 9
representative patients, including 6 in non-critical group (Figure 3A) and 3 in critical
group (Figure 3B), were presented in Figure 3. The first positive time point of RNA tests
appeared earlier than that of Ab in 7 of 9 patients, except for the case 185 (Ab was
detectable 2 days earlier than RNA) and the case 111 (at the same day). It should be
noted that the risings of antibodies were not always accompanied by RNA clearance,
particularly in the 3 critical patients. This finding suggested that antibodies may not be
sufficient to clear the virus. In the pooled analyses on all involved patients, the average
antibody levels showed a marked increase since about 1-week after onset and

continuously elevated during the next 2 weeks (Figure 4A). Further analyses
suggested that there was no significant difference on the average S/CO value of Ab
tests between critical and non-critical patients before day 12 after onset (Figure 4B).
However, critical patients showed significantly higher Ab S/CO values than non-critical
cases in about 2-week after onset (p = 0.02) and this association was not significant in
either IgM or IgG tests (data not shown). For further exploration, we determined the
relative Ab titer of these samples (expressed as relative optical density, rOD) by serial
dilution measurements of each sample. The quantitative data of Ab titers also revealed
a significant difference (p = 0.004) between patients in critical and non-critical groups
(Figure 4C). Multivariate longitudinal GEE analyses suggested that age (β = 0.139, p
< 0.001), gender (β = 1.415, p = 0.006) and Ab titer (β = 0.336, p = 0.006) were the
independent factors strongly associated with the clinical classification based on the
severity (Table 4).
Discussion
The present data demonstrated that typical antibody responses to acute viral infection
are wildly induced in COVID-19 patients. All patients were seroconverted, except for
12 patients with only samples collected at the early stage of illness (before 13 day of
onset). To be expected, the total antibody was first detected, followed by IgM and IgG.
The seroconversion rate and the antibody levels increased rapidly during the first two
weeks, the cumulative seropositive rate reached 50% on the 11th day and 100% on
the 39th day. The seroconversion time of total antibody, IgM and IgG antibodies
appeared consequently (p < 0.05) with a median seroconversion day of 11, 12 and 14,

respectively. Due to the lack of blood samples collected from patients in the later stage
of illness, how long the antibodies could last remained unknown. Our results
demonstrated an excellent sensitivity of Ab test in detections of patient’s samples after
1-week since onset. Notably, even in the early stages of the illness within 7-day, some
patients with negative nucleic acid findings could be screened out through antibody
testing. Combining RNA test and antibody test significantly raised the sensitivity for
detecting patients (p < 0.001). Above findings indicate that the antibody detection be
an important supplement to RNA detection during the illness course.
Up to date, the confirm diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection entirely depend on the viral
nucleic acid testing. Even though with high analytical sensitivity, the real-world
performance of PCR based RNA testing is unsatisfied. Many suspected patients had
to be tested for several days with multiple samples before confirm diagnosis were
made, and during the waiting time they might have not enough priority to receive
relevant treatments and quarantine managements.3 These problems make the timely
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection one of the bottlenecks for adapting relevant actions
to limit the damage of current outbreak. Our study provided robust evidences that: 1)
the acute antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 infection patient is very similar to many
other acute viral infections; 2) the serological testing can be a powerful approach in
achieving timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 3) the total antibody is more
sensitive than IgM and IgG for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Thus, the antibody testing might play vital roles in the following settings: 1) for the
suspected patient under the initial visit or clinically diagnosed patients has not been

confirmed by RNA testing, the positive result of antibody increases the confidence to
make a COVID-19 diagnosis; 2) for healthy close contact who is in the quarantine
period, he/she should be deemed as a probable carriers if antibody positive, then the
RNA should be tested more frequently and the close contacts of him/her should be
observed; 3) for the RNA confirmed patient, seropositive indicates that the specific
immune response had been induced. Besides, epidemiological studies could be
conducted using immunoassays. Additional, it can play an important role in searching
potential animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 using Ab-ELISA because the double antigen
sandwich method makes it free from species restriction. It has been less than three
months since the SARS-CoV-2 virus first invaded human society, and the prevalence
of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 is nearly zero. Therefore, at least during the current
outbreak which is likely to continue to May or June 2020, individuals who are
seropositive could be a probably preceding infector of SARS-CoV-2. During this short
period, therefore, the total antibody could be considered as a recent infection marker
similar as IgM antibody. Our data showed that the sensitivity of total antibody testing
is higher than IgM or IgG. Therefore, the total antibody detection should be given high
priority to be implemented in current clinical and public health practice. If, unfortunately,
SARS-CoV-2 become a common respiratory transmission pathogen lasting in human
society, such as influenza viruses or low-pathogenicity types of coronaviruses, rather
than be completely eradicated as its relative SARS-CoV-1 virus, the serological
diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection will more depend on the detection of IgM
antibody in post-epidemic areas, such as Wuhan, China, in the subsequent epidemic

seasons. The total antibody and IgG antibody could be used to understand the
epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assist in determining the level of humoral
immune response in patients. Even then, the total antibody will be a more sensitive
marker for sentinel monitoring of imported cases in naive community.
In addition to the diagnosis value of Ab test, our study revealed a strong positive
correlation between clinical severity and antibody titer since 2-week after illness onset,
for the first time in COVID-19 patients. The results suggested that a high titer of total
antibodies against the virus may be considered as a risk factor of critical illness,
independently from older age, male gender and comorbidities (Table 4). Although it
was still unclear how the causal relation between hormonal response and illness
severity, the results raise a possible usage of the high antibody titer as a surrogate
marker for worse clinical prognosis. Furthermore, it might be an evidence for the
possibility of antibody-dependent disease enhancement effects, which was commonly
found in SARS-CoV-1 patients.11-13 Whatsoever, our finding suggested that the clinical
meanings of the level of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 during the acute phase of
infection warrant further study.
It should be noted that there were some limitations of this study. First, for most of RNA
tests of the patients were based on upper respiratory tract specimens, the positive rate
may be higher in detection using lower respiratory tract specimens, such as
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, deep tracheal aspirates, and induced sputum may yield
higher sensitivity for RNA tests. Second, we cannot evaluate the persistence of
antibodies because samples were collected during the acute illness course of patients.

Third, although it had shown good specificity in healthy people, the cross-reactivity
among the different coronaviruses cannot be accurately assessed because we cannot
obtain blood samples from SARS-CoV-1 and other coronaviruses infection patients.
Future studies are needed to a better understanding of the antibody response profile
of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that antibody tests have important diagnosis
value in addition to RNA tests. These findings provide strong evidence for the routine
application of serological antibody assays in the diagnosis and clinical management of
COVID-19 patients.

Figure 1. Cumulative incidence of seroconversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV2 among COVID-19 patients during the acute phase since illness onset. (A)
Cumulative incidence of seroconversion of Ab, IgM and IgG among 173 patients of this
study. Kaplan–Meier curves for time to seroconversion of Ab (B), IgM (C) and IgG (D) for
comparison of patients in critical condition or not. P values were determined by Log-Rank
test to compare different markers.

Figure 2. Profiling of sensitivity performances of RNA, Ab, IgM and IgG in time series
since illness onset. A heat-map of detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection according to the
time (days) since onset by a single RNA or antibody test.

Figure 3. Dynamic profiling of viral RNA and antibodies in representative COVID-19
patients since onset of disease. The changes of the levels of RNA in in upper respiratory
specimens (nasal and/or throat swabs) and antibodies (total Ab, IgM and IgG) in plasma
of 9 patients were presented. Among these cases, 6 were in normal to moderate illness
condition (A) and 3 were in critical condition (B). The cutoff values for antibody tests were
S/CO=1 (plotted to left-Y axis) and was CT=40 for RNA detection (plotted to right-Y axis).
RNA negative samples are denoted with a CT of 45. The blue area indicated the antibody
seronegative zone, whereas the purple area indicated undetectable RNA zone. Meanwhile,
a purple broken line was used to indicate the first time point with detectable RNA and a red
broken line was used to indicate the first antibody seroconversion (total Ab) time point.

Figure 4. The average levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19
patients since illness onset. (A) Comparison of the average S/CO value of in between
total Ab, IgG and IgM. Comparison of the average S/CO value (B) and relative quantitative
titer (C) of Ab test between critical and non-critical patients. The medians of antibody
detection value (S/CO for tests of Ab, IgM and IgG, for panel A and B) and of total Ab titer
(rOD, for panel C) of samples at the same time point since onset was used to plot the
graph. Patient’s samples collected from day 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-21, 2239 since illness onset were pooled for analysis. Four parameter logistic (4PL) fitting curves
were used to show the rising trend of antibodies (total Ab, IgG, IgM).
