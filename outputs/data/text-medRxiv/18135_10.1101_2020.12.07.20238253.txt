Abstract
The standard growth model of epidemic evolution such as the Richards generalized logistic function is
remarkably successful because it agrees with almost all previous epidemic data. Yet, it fails to explain
intervention measures for mitigations of the ongoing coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It
also fails to replicate an endemic phase that occurs in many countries epidemic curves (time series data
of daily new cases). These discrepancies demonstrate that new epidemic laws are required to understand,
predict and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we show that almost all COVID-19 evolution can
be modeled by three innovative epidemic laws. Specifically, based on the world COVID-19 data, we first
divide an epidemic curve into three phases: an exponential growth phase, an exponential decay phase, and a
constant endemic phase. We next integrate the growth and the decay phases into the first epidemic law with
interventions as a model parameter. This law is completely opposite to the Richards generalized logistic
function in terms of intervention measures. We then combine the first epidemic law with the endemic phase
to form the second epidemic law, which makes the curve of cumulative cases increase linearly as time
tends to infinity. The third epidemic law states if an epidemic is composed of multiple epidemic waves,
the superposition principle applies. These laws were confirmed by the COVID-19 data from 18 countries
including undeveloped, developing and developed countries. Finally, we pave the way for future research to
incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR model. We anticipate that the results from this research
can provide a scientific base for governments to mitigate the COVID-19 and other epidemic disasters.
Keywords: COVID-19 model; endemic phase; epidemic curve; epidemic law; generalized Fermi function;
intervention mitigation measures; Richards generalized logistic function; SIR model.

Introduction
Problem and Significance
The Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an ongoing disease spreading all over the world. It
has negatively impacted the world public health and economy. It caused more than 67M confirmed cases and
more than 1.5M deaths since December 2019. It caused a world economic slowdown and made hundreds
of millions of people unemployed. These numbers are continually climbing until herd immunity occurs
naturally or a high percentage of the world population is vaccinated.
To suppress the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic before herd immunity, various mitigation measures
have been implemented all over the world. Now, an important problem facing the world is: How do we
assess the effects of various mitigation measures implemented to the COVID-19 pandemic and what did

we learn from it? Furthermore, How many people will be infected and how many people will die in this
pandemic? When will this pandemic end? How does this pandemic affect the world economy? To answer
these questions requires epidemic laws that accurately describe how an epidemic evolves under intervention
measures. In this research, we discover epidemic laws based on the COVID-19 data facts.

Data Facts
In epidemiology, a case is an individual infected by a disease; an epidemic curve is a curve of time series
data of daily new cases; and a cumulative curve is a curve of total cases against time. Fig. 1(a) shows the
cumulative curve of the first COVID-19 wave in Italy; and Fig. 1(b) is the corresponding epidemic curve.
Mathematically, the change of the slope in Fig. 1(a) gives the epidemic curve in Fig. 1(b) that is observed
with the following facts:
It has three phases: a growth phase, a decay phase, and an endemic phase.
It increases exponentially in the growth phase.
It decreases exponentially in the decay phase but the decay rate is affected by intervention measures.
The growth and decay phases are connected with a hump but positively skewed.
It tends to a constant asymptotically. If the constant is zero, the epidemic dies. Otherwise, the epidemic becomes an endemic that may trigger a second epidemic wave.
These facts make the cumulative curve in Fig. 1(a) bend upward exponentially in the growth phase and
downward exponentially in the decay phase, and increase linearly in the endemic phase. These facts set the
premises to justify an existing epidemic theory and to induce a new epidemic theory.

Status and Gaps
Let us first justify that the current epidemic models or theories cannot replicate all of the facts in Figs. 1(a)
and 1(b) accurately. For example, the most popular model to describe the cumulative cases against time in
Fig. 1(a) is the Richards (1959) generalized logistic function:
c=

[1 + m exp ( t + t1 )]1=m

time; t1 = ln[(c0 m 1)=m] = a dimensionless reference time with c0 as the initial condition; and m =
an asymmetric parameter that is the only parameter to express the effects of intervention measures for
mitigating the COVID-19 disaster. Thus, in this research, we call m the intervention parameter. At m ! 0,
Eq. (1a) reduces to the Gompertz (1825) function; and at m = 1, it reduces to the classic logistic function.

the magnitude, it has no effects on its decay rate. These conclusions contradict our common understanding
of the topic that intervention mitigation measures do not affect the initial exponential growth but do significantly flatten the curve in the decay phase. Besides, as t ! ∞, Eq. (2b) tends to 1 instead of a linear growth;
and Eq. (4b) tends to zero instead of a positive constant. These results disagree with the data facts in the
endemic phase in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b).
Therefore, in terms of the effects of intervention measures and the endemic phase, the Richards (1959)
generalized logistic function fails to describe the COVID-19 evolution in all of the three phases. Besides, it
provides little knowledge on an epidemic with multiple epidemic waves.

Objective and Research Questions
The objective of this research is then to fill the above gaps with three innovative epidemic laws, which form
a new epidemic theory. Specifically, we reach the objective by asking the following research questions:
1. Can we establish a theoretical law that correctly reflects the effects of intervention measures?
2. Can we find a simple epidemic law that accurately describes the evolution of COVID-19 that has an
endemic phase?
3. How do we model an epidemic evolution with multiple epidemic waves?

Hypotheses
We answer the three research questions by making the following hypotheses: A pandemic consists of many
epidemics. An epidemic may have multiple epidemic waves. Referring to Fig. 1(b) and the data facts, an
epidemic wave in terms of epidemic curves has the following features:
1. It increases exponentially in the growth phase.
2. It decreases exponentially in the decay phase but the decay rate is affected by intervention measures.
3. The growth and decay phases smoothly connect through a hump.
4. If an epidemic wave decays out, the epidemic curve approaches to zero as time tends to infinity.
5. If an epidemic wave decays to a positive constant as time tends to infinity, the epidemic becomes an
endemic that may trigger a second epidemic wave.
6. If an epidemic has two or more epidemic waves, the superposition principle applies.

Research Approach
We integrate the six hypotheses into a theory using both inductive and deductive reasoning:
Step 1: We integrate the first four hypotheses into a general differential equation. This process merges
the two exponential laws in the growth and decay phases [Fig. 1(b)] into a single differential equation
that results in the first epidemic law on cumulative cases without an endemic phase [Fig. 1(b)]. This law
includes an explicit parameter expressing the effects of intervention mitigation measures, which answers our
first research question. As a corollary of the first law, we deduce an epidemic curve equation on the time
series of daily new cases.
Step 2: We generate the second epidemic law on cumulative cases by combining the first law with the
endemic phase (Hypothesis 5) in Fig. 1(a). As a corollary of the second law, we deduce an epidemic curve
equation that includes all three phases in Fig. 1(b). This step answers the second research question.

Step 3: We apply the superposition principle to an epidemic with multiple epidemic waves (Hypothesis
6) to form the third epidemic law. As a corollary of the third law, we deduce an expression to describe epidemic curves with multiple epidemic waves. This step results in the solution to the third research question.
Step 4: We test the three epidemic laws and their corollaries with the COVID-19 data that are from
Worldometer (2020) at https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/.

Epidemic Theory
Consider an isolated epidemic system with constant population P. At time T , the susceptible population is
S (T ), and the infected population (or the number of cumulative cases) is C (T ). If the home population due
to lockdowns is a constant Ph and the vaccinated population is a constant Pv , then
S (T ) +C (T ) + Ph + Pv = P

(5)

At T ! ∞, all susceptibles are infected, S (∞) = 0, the number of terminal cases from Eq. (5) is then
C (∞) = P

Ph

Pv

(6)

which states that to minimize the terminal cases C (∞), the best mitigation measure is to increase Pv by
vaccinating a large part of the population. If without vaccines (Pv = 0), the second best measure is to let
people stay home through lockdowns and thus to increase the home population Ph . Here, we assume people
are not susceptible if they stay home and do not contact with infected individuals.
Eqs. (5) and (6) result in the susceptible population at time T as:
S (T ) = C (∞)

C (T )

(7)

where the data of C (T ) are reported everyday by health agencies (Worldometer 2020) as COVID-19 evolves.
In what follows, we find three mathematical laws to describe C (T ), based on the COVID-19 data. For
brevity, we denote C (∞) = C1 .

The First Epidemic Law without an Endemic Phase
Let µ = initial infection rate (d 1 ) that is the number of individuals infected by an existing case a day. This
rate depends on virus features, climate conditions, and human behaviors, namely,
µ = µ(virus features, climate conditions, human behaviors)

(8)

According to Hypothesis (1) and Fig. 1, the daily new cases dC=dT increases exponentially at T ! 0. Thus,
the two numbers C and dC=dT in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) satisfy the following differential equation:
dC
= µC
dT

(9)

According to Hypothesis (2) and Fig. 1, in the decay phase, the daily new cases dC=dT decreases
exponentially but the decay rate is affected by human interventions, which leads to
dC
=
dT

µ
C
m

(10a)

where similar to it in Eq. (1a), m = intervention parameter expressing change of human behaviors in Eq.
(8). Hypothesis (4) requires dC=dT = 0 at T ! ∞. Considering C (∞) = C1 , we revise Eq. (10a) as:

where µ=m = effective infection rate with intervention measures = decay rate, and C1 C = susceptible at
time T according to Eq. (7). Eq. (10b) states that the most efficient way to suppress the daily new cases
dC=dT is to minimize the susceptible C1 C by reducing C1 through Eq. (6). This is what China did in
controlling the COVID-19 virus despite vaccines. The second way is to make the intervention parameter
m > 1 by changing human behaviors such as keeping social distancing, mask wearing, and hand hygiene,
which reduces the effective infection rate µ=m and thus reduces the daily new cases dC=dT . The second
way is widely practiced in the rest of the world.
Taking Eqs. (9) and (10b) as premises, by analogy to an eddy viscosity model for turbulent open channel
flow (Guo 1988), we induce the following generalized differential equation:

(11a)

where 1 (1 C=C1 )m = probability that susceptible meet infected individuals, which is intuitive if taking
m = 1 (natural spread) and assuming Ph = Pv = 0 in Eqs. (5) and (6). Eq. (11a) is then interpreted from the
right to the left side as: At time T , the system has susceptible C1 C who meet infected individuals with a
probability 1 (1 C=C1 )m . If the effective infection rate is µ=m, then the product of the three factors is
the daily new cases dC=dT .
Defining c = C=C1 as the dimensionless number of C and t = µT as the dimensionless number of T , Eq.
(11a) reduces to

(11b)

which has three special cases:
(1) At m ! 0, according to L’Hopital’s rule, limm!0 [1 (1 c)m ] =m = ln (1 c), which makes Eq.
(11b) grows fastest, namely,
dc
= (1 c) ln (1 c)
(12a)
dt
which results in a double exponential law:
c=1

exp et ln (1

c0 )

(12b)

where c0 = the dimensionless initial condition at t = 0. This case represents the fastest growth of a disease
spread and is plotted in Fig. 3, assuming c0 = 0:05.
(2) At m = 1, Eq. (11b) reduces to
dc
= c (1 c)
(13a)
dt
which results in the standard logistic function:
c=

1
1 + exp ( t + t1 )

(13b)

where t1 = dimensionless inflection time at c = 1=2. Eq. (13b) is plotted in Fig. 3 and represents a natural
spread of diseases under constant environmental and societal conditions.
(3) At m ! ∞, Eq. (11b) reduces to: dc=dt = 0, which gives
c = c0

(14)

plotted in Fig. 3. This extreme case states we could have suppressed COVID-19 to its initial condition c0
and squashed it in the bud if we had taken extreme mitigation measures (m ! ∞), for example, suspending
all international airlines and ships worldwide in February 2020.

which states that intervention measures change both the magnitude and the decay rate in the decay phase.
These extremes agree with our common understanding of the topic but are completely opposite to Eqs. (2a)
and (2b) from the Richards (1959) generalized logistic function.
The effects of the intervention parameter m are further explained in Fig. 3 by plotting Eq. (17a). It
shows that: as 0 m < 1, the cumulative curve c (t) is raised, compared with the natural spread (m = 1);
as m increases from 1, the cumulative curve c (t) is flattened; as m ! ∞, the disease is completely squashed
to its initial condition c0 . Mathematically, Eq. (17a) contains the three special cases so we call it the first
epidemic law, which answers our first research question.
Corollary 1: The dimensionless epidemic curve q (t) in terms of the daily new cases is derived by

Assuming c0 = 0:001 in Eq. (17b) for t1 , Eq. (19b) is then plotted in Fig. 4(a) in linear scale and Fig. 4(b)
in logarithmic scale. Letting dq=dt = 0 gives the maximum of daily cases at
ti = t1 + ln m

(20)

which states that the real inflection time ti in Fig. 3 is postponed by ln m if mitigation measures are applied
(m > 1). If m < 1, the real inflection time ti appears earlier than the natural inflection time t1 .
If m = 0, Eq. (12b) yields
q=

which gives both the fastest growth and the fastest decay of daily new cases, as shown in Fig. 4.

which is the symmetric solitary wave equation in shallow water hydrodynamics (Korteweg and de Vries
1895), quantum mechanics (Fermi et al. 1955) and mathematics (Wazwaz 2009). Thus, in this research, we
call a single epidemic wave a solitary epidemic wave or simply an epidemic soliton.
If 0 m < 1, the epidemic curves from Eq. (19b) grow and decay faster than the natural disease spread
(m = 1), as shown in Fig. 4(a). This states we can quickly reach herd immunity and end an epidemic by
mixing susceptible and infected individuals by mass gatherings and events. Nevertheless, this may quickly
overwhelm public health systems and thus risk population lives. To save lives from COVID-19 before
vaccines are invented, we should flatten the curves in Fig. 4(a) by increasing m from 1.
Particularly, Fig. 4(a) shows that unlike Fig. 2(b) from the generalized logistic function, the intervention
parameter m does not affect the initial growth, as expected from Eq. (18a). This is also explained in Fig.
4(b) with the logarithmic scale. Furthermore, Fig. 4(b) shows that Eq. (19b) successfully replicates the two
exponential laws in the growth and decay phases. Unfortunately, similar to the Richards (1959) generalized
logistic function of Eq. (1a), Eq. (19b) gives q (∞) = 0 and thus it cannot replicate the endemic phase in
Fig. 1(a), which is addressed below.

The Second Epidemic Law with an Endemic Phase
The endemic phase is an equilibrium state of an epidemic system under constant environmental and societal
conditions. If these conditions are disturbed by changes of climate, human behaviors and interventions, the
endemic triggers a second epidemic wave. Therefore, the endemic phase should be included if an epidemic
does not die asymptotically.
According to Hypothesis (5) and Fig. 1(b), an endemic phase exists if dc=dt = a at t ! ∞, where a = a
small positive constant. In terms of cumulative cases (integration), this implies at t ! ∞, we have
c = 1 + at

(23)

where the integration constant 1 is obtained from the first epidemic law where c (∞) = 1 at a = 0.
We can generalize Eq. (23) and the first epidemic law of Eq. (15b) into a single equation by c = Eq.
(15b) Eq. (23), resulting in
c = (1 f 1=m ) (1 + at)
(24a)
where (1 + at) = a dimensionless endemic factor. Applying Eq. (16b) in Eq. (24a) gives
n
o
c = 1 [1 + exp (t t1 )] 1=m (1 + at)

(24b)

which is plotted in Fig. 5(a), assuming c0 = 0:001 and m = 4. Eq. (24a) or (24b) is the second epidemic
law describing the cumulative cases with an endemic phase.
Similar to the intervention parameter m, the endemic constant a has no effects on the initial growth, as
shown in Fig. 5(a). Besides, if a = 0, Eq. (24b) reduces to Eq. (17a) so the first epidemic law is a special
case of the second epidemic law.

Figure 5: Graphical interpretation of the second epidemic law: (a) dimensionless cumulative cases from Eq.
(24b); (b) epidemic curve from Eq. (25b), assuming c0 = 0:001 and m = 4
which is plotted in Fig. 5(b) on the effects of the endemic constant a, assuming c0 = 0:001 and m = 4.
Clearly, if a = 0, the number of daily cases q tends to zero at t ! ∞, implying that an epidemic eventually
dies; if a is very small, the epidemic eventually becomes an endemic and it is controllable; yet, if a is very
large, the epidemic is out of control and many epidemic waves are coming one after another.
Let dq=dt = 0 in Eq. (25a), we obtain that the maximum of daily cases in Fig. 5(b) occurs at
#

1
(26)
ti = t1 + ln
m + 1 1 + ati
which is an implicit equation for ti . Eq. (26) states that the real inflection time ti is further postponed if an
endemic exists, as shown in Fig. 5(b).
Note that for a > 0, the value of C1 is simply a scale of C because an asymptotic value of C does not exists
in Fig. 5(a). Fig. 5(b) shows that Eq. (25a) replicates all of the three phases in Fig. 1(b), which provides an
advantage over the Richards (1959) generalized logistic function, including the Gompertz (1825) function
and the classic logistic function. Therefore, the second epidemic law of Eq. (24a) and Corollary 2 of Eq.
(25a) answer our second research question.

The Third Epidemic Law for Multiple Epidemic Waves
An epidemic system may have multiple epidemic waves because of several reasons: (1) It may have multiple
disease sources; (2) the endemic phase is disturbed by changes of mitigation measures or other factors; and
(3) the case scale C1 or C (∞) may not be constant in Eq. (6) because of national holidays, celebrations,
elections, protestations, and so on.
Once multiple epidemic waves occur, Hypothesis (6) states that the superposition principle applies. First,
if herd immunity is achieved after many epidemic waves, then q (∞) = 0, which requires a = 0 in Eqs. (24a)
and (25a). Therefore, each wave is an independent solitary wave described by the first epidemic law. The
superposition principle in terms of dimensional form then gives

3rd stage

Figure 6: Epidemic curve of COVID-19 in Australia with multiple waves (Worldometer 2020)
where Ck and mk = scale of cases and intervention parameter for the k-th epidemic wave, respectively; and
the corresponding Fermi function from Eq. (16b) is
fk =

1
1 + exp [µk (T

(27b)

Tk )]

where µk and Tk = initial infection rate and natural inflection time for the k-th wave, respectively.
Nevertheless, if an endemic exists even after n waves (Fig. 6), then as T ! ∞, all waves share a common
dimensionless endemic factor (1 + at) or (1 + AT ) with A as a small dimensional endemic constant (d 1 ).
Therefore, the superposition from the second epidemic law gives
n

C = (1 + AT ) ∑ Ck 1

which is the third epidemic law describing the cumulative cases with multiple epidemic waves. Eq. (28)

which has three possible results: (1) If Q (∞) is zero, then the epidemic dies or herd immunity is achieved,
which corresponds to Eq. (27a); (2) if Q (∞) is small, the epidemic is controllable even without vaccines;
and (3) if Q (∞) is large, then the epidemic transmission is out of control and the only way to suppress Eq.
(30) is to vaccinate a large part of population and thus to reduce the susceptible Ck according to Eq. (6).

Population and Sample Data
The three epidemic laws are derived for the cumulative cases from the population data of a closed system
(state or country). Nevertheless, the real number of cumulative cases is never known if without testing of

the entire population. All we know is the number of cumulative confirmed cases and the cumulative deaths.
In this research, we assume (1) the sample dataset is similar to the population dataset,

population

(2) the number of cumulative deaths (D) is also described by the three laws because of similarity of time
series data between daily new cases and daily deaths (Worldometer 2020).

Determination of Model Parameters
For a solitary epidemic wave, the second epidemic law of Eq. (24b) has five model parameters: the infection
rate µ; the scale C1 for cases; the intervention parameter m; the natural inflection time T1 ; and the endemic
constant A. They are obtained by fitting Eq. (24b) to data in terms of C (T ), using the Matlab (2020b)
least-squares function lsqcurvefit.m. The initial values of these parameters are set as follows:
The infection rate µ, defined by Eq. (9), is the daily new cases produced by an existing case during
an incubation period. We assume once a case is identified, it is completely contained without transmission. According to WHO (2020), the incubation period of COVID-19 is between 2 and 14 days
and the reproductive number R0 is between 1:4 and 2:5. This research then assumes R0 = 2 and the
incubation period to be 10 days in such a way that we set µ ' 0:2 d 1 .
The scale C1 starts at C1 = max (C). For death curves, C1 is replaced by D1 .
The intervention parameter m starts at m = 4 if mitigation measures are applied.
The natural inflection time T1 starts at T1 = Ti corresponding to the maximum of daily cases.
The value of A starts at A = 0 d

1

because A

0.

Similar initial values are set for each epidemic wave if an epidemic consists of multiple waves.

Test of the Second Epidemic Law with Data of Solitary Epidemic Waves
The first epidemic law is a special case of the second law that is best tested with data from countries that
are still in the first wave but with a fully developed endemic phase, as shown in Fig. 7 where (C; Q) =
cumulative cases and daily cases in sub-figures (a) and (b), respectively, and (D; Qd ) = cumulative deaths
and daily deaths in sub-figures (c) and (d), respectively. Fig. 7 includes data from 11 countries, including
South Africa, Chile, Bolivia, Qatar, Egypt, Eswatini, French Guyana, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, and
Yemen. These data confirm the second epidemic law and its corollary. Fig. 8 further validates the second
law with the first wave data from six developed countries, including the U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Italy,
and the State of New York in the U.S.
The model parameters from Figs. 7 and 8 are tabulated in Table 1. It shows that: (1) The mean value of
the initial infection rate, µ = 0:08 d 1 , from Fig. 7 is much less than µ = 0:21 d 1 from Fig. 8. The mean
value of the natural inflection time, T1 = 118 d, from Fig. 7 is much larger than T1 = 34 d from Fig. 8. These
values mean that COVID-19 spreads much faster in developed countries because of active economics. (2)
The mean value of the intervention parameter m for Fig. 7 is close to 1, meaning that COVID-19 spreads
in some undeveloped and developing countries almost naturally without mitigations. Yet, the mean value of
m is 4 for Fig. 8, meaning that COVID-19 is significantly suppressed by mitigation measures in developed
countries. (3) Although the endemic constants A in Table 1 for cases are small, they are the flames to trigger
second waves. (4) The death parameters are comparable with the case parameters because the death number
increases with increasing the case number.

Test of the Third Epidemic Law with Data of Multiple Epidemic Waves
We divide an epidemic system with multiple waves into three stages: The first stage is the exponential
growth phase of the first wave that spreads under the natural environmental and normal societal conditions
(Figs. 4 and 6). The second stage is affected by mitigation measures but a new normal is still developing
(Fig. 6). When the new normal is developed, the epidemic enters the third stage that is characterized by a
symmetric link between two consecutive waves or a symmetric wave with m = 1.
In what follows, we compare Eqs. (27a) and (28) with the COVID-19 data of the U.S. and Australia,
which represent two different patterns under different mitigation measures.
Data of Australia
Fig. 6 shows that Australia has experienced two complete epidemic waves with endemics. The first wave is
asymmetric and broke out under the natural environmental and normal societal conditions. The second wave
connects the first wave with a U-shaped symmetric link so the infection rate µ1 =m1 in the first decay phase
is equal to the infection rate µ2 in the second growth phase. This implies that the new normal condition has
been developed since the first peak. Under the new normal condition, the second wave follows the classic
logistic model and thus m2 = 1.
Based on these conditions, Eq. (28) is specified as:
i
o
n h
C = (1 + AT ) C1 1 f1 + exp [µ1 (T T1 )]g 1=m1 +C2 [1 + exp f[ (µ1 =m1 ) (T T2 )]g] 1
(32)
where µ1 , T1 , C1 , m1 , T2 , C2 and A are fit parameters. Fitting Eq. (32) to the data in Fig. 9(a) results in:

µ1 = 0:459 d 1 ,
T2 = 167 d,

T1 = 34 d,
C2 = 16939,

C1 = 6644, m1 = 4:52
A = 6:53 10 4 d 1

which yields the solid line in Fig. 9(a) with a determination coefficient R2 = 0:9999, meaning excellent
agreement. Note that the number of cumulative cases in Australia increases linearly as T becomes very
large until herd immunity is achieved, which is further explained with the daily cases.
The epidemic curve of daily cases from Eq. (29), together with the data, is plotted in Fig. 9(b). At
T ! ∞, Eq. (30) gives Q (∞) = 6:53 10 4 (6644 + 16939) = 15 cases/d, which implies that COVID-19
in Australia is controllable even without vaccines.
As for the death waves, we directly fit Eq. (28) to the cumulative death data in Fig. 9(c), resulting in
µ1 = 0:122 d 1 ,
T1 = 40 d,
1
µ2 = 0:0904 d , T2 = 174 d,
A = 2:29 10 14 d 1

D1 = 98,
D2 = 811,

m1 = 1:01
m2 = 1:04

which yields the solid line in Fig. 9(c) with a determination coefficient R2 = 0:9996. The death epidemic
curve from Eq. (29) and the data are then compared in Fig. 9(d). At T ! ∞, Eq. (30) gives Qd (∞) = 0,
implying that COVID-19 in Australia has been controlled. The total deaths will be D (∞) = D1 + D2 = 909.
Generally, the values of µ for deaths are less than those for cases, implying the death grows slower than
that of cases. Second, the natural inflection times Tk are comparable with those for cases, implying the death
pattern follows that of cases. Third, both values of m for deaths are close to 1, implying that the COVID-19
death in Australia grows almost naturally and can be well described by a double-logistic model.
Data of the U.S.
The COVID-19 data in the U.S. are plotted in Fig. 10 that is different from Fig. 9 for Australia, because
it does not have an endemic phase and two consecutive waves have a time overlap. Furthermore, a new
normal condition (the third stage) with constant mitigation measures has not been developed because each
state applied different measures in different times. For such a case, we fit Eq. (27a) to wave data one by one.
We first apply Eq. (27a) to the data until T = 100 d in Fig. 10(b) for the first wave, namely,
n
o
C = C1 1 f1 + exp [µ1 (T T1 )]g 1=m1
(33)

resulting in µ1 = 0:270 d 1 , T1 = 40 d, C1 = 4:51 106 , and m1 = 33 that means the first wave is significantly flattened. The resulting cumulative and daily cases equations are plotted in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b),
respectively, with dashed lines.
We next add the second wave to the first wave and fit the data until T = 200 d in Fig. 10(b) for the second
wave parameters, resulting in µ2 = 0:146 d 1 , T2 = 138 d, C2 = 4:72 106 , and m2 = 8:60. The resulting
cumulative and daily cases equations are also plotted in Fig. 10(a) and 10(b) with dashed lines. We see that
µ2 < µ1 , T2 T1 = 98 d > T1 = 40 d and m2 > 1. Thus, the second wave is further suppressed.
We then add the third wave to the second one. Because the third wave has not yet completed in Fig.
10(b), we assume m3 = 4 based on the values in Table 1 for developed countries and the first wave of
Australia. The other model parameters are then fitted as µ3 = 0:0647 d 1 , T3 = 274 d, and C3 = 2:09 107 .
We see that though µ3 < µ2 , T3 T2 = 174 d > T2 T1 = 98 d, which suppress the third wave, the value of
C3 is one order of magnitude larger than C1 and C2 and magnifies the daily cases significantly according to
Eq. (10b). Therefore, the current mitigation measures in the U.S. cannot further suppress the COVID-19
transmission. The only way for the U.S. to return to normal is to vaccinate a large part of the population, as
stated in Eq. (6), which then reduces the infection potential in Eq. (10b).

If without a fourth wave, the total cases in the U.S. will be C (∞) = C1 + C2 + C3 = 30M, which is
approximately 10% of the U.S. population.
Fig. 10(d) shows that the death waves follow the case waves. Similarly, we can find the wave parameters
as follows:
µ1 = 0:208 d 1 , T1 = 35 d,
D1 = 1:59 105 , m1 = 10:1
µ2 = 0:283 d 1 , T2 = 140 d, D2 = 1:63 105 , m2 = 48:4
µ3 = 0:079 d 1 T3 = 272 d D3 = 1:60 105 m3 = 4 (assumed)
which plot Eqs. (27a) and (29) with A = 0 in Figs. 10(c) and 10(d), respectively. The total deaths in the
U.S. will be D (∞) = D1 + D2 + D3 = 482K. The terminal case fatality rate in the U.S. is then approximately
482000= 30 106 = 1: 61%.
Briefly, the data of the U.S. and Australia validate the third epidemic law and its corollary. Yet, further
tests with the whole world data, including the U.S. states data, are needed in future studies. Besides, To
incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR model is also a research need, which is briefed below.

Future Research: SIR Model with Intervention Measures
Eq. (11a) describes the production of daily new cases, which can be used to improve the classic SIR model
proposed by Kermack and McKendrick (1927), who further divided C (T ) in Eq. (5) into active infectious
cases I (T ) and removed cases R (T ). The SIR model reads:
dS
I
= µS
dT
S0
dI
I
= µS
dT
S0
dR
= βI
dT

(34)
βI

(35)
(36)

where S0 = initial susceptible or the system population if Ph = Pv = 0 in Eqs. (5) and (6); I=S0 = probability
that susceptible meet infected individuals; and β = recovery rate. Eq. (34) is the daily decrease of susceptible; Eq. (35) is the daily change of active cases; and Eq. (36) is the daily removed cases including deaths
and recovered.
If intervention measures are applied, according to Eq. (11a), the infection rate µ becomes the effective
infection rate µ=m, and the probability that susceptible meet infected individuals becomes [1 (1 I=S0 )m ].
Therefore, Eqs. (34) and (35) are modified as:
dS
µ
=
1
dT
m

µ
=

These two equations reduce to Eqs. (34) and (35) at the initial growth where I S0 and at m = 1 if without
intervention measures. The detailed study of intervention measures on the SIR model through Eqs. (36)-(38)
is a future research need in epidemiology.

Conclusions
Based on the world COVID-19 data, we divided an epidemic curve into three phases: a growth phase, a decay
phase, and an endemic phase. We then discovered two simple epidemic laws inductively and deductively

to describe the three phases mathematically. Furthermore, we extended the two laws to an epidemic with
multiple epidemic waves to obtain a third epidemic law. Specifically, we reach the following conclusions:
The first epidemic law states that given an isolated epidemic system with human interventions, if the
epidemic decays out asymptotically without an endemic phase, the curve of cumulative cases is a
sigmoid curve (Fig. 3) described by the complement of the generalized Fermi function [Eq. (17a)].
As a corollary, this law leads to an epidemic curve that grows and decays both exponentially, but the
decay phase is flattened by intervention mitigation measures [Eq. (19b) and Fig. 4]. The classic
logistic law is a special case under constant environmental and normal societal conditions.
The second epidemic law combines the first law and the endemic phase [Eq. (24b)]. It states that if
an epidemic has an endemic phase, the number of cumulative cases increases linearly as time tends
to infinity [Fig. 5(a)]. As a corollary, this law states that the number of daily new cases grows
exponentially, decays exponentially, but tends to a constant in the endemic phase [Fig. 5(b)]. If
the endemic constant is small, the epidemic is controllable with mitigation measures even without
vaccines; otherwise, it is out of control if without vaccines.
The third epidemic law is a superposition principle for an epidemic system with multiple epidemic
waves. It states that: (1) If there is not an endemic phase between two consecutive waves, then the
resultant number of cumulative cases is a superposition of the first epidemic law [Eq. (27a)]. (2) If
an epidemic has an endemic phase even after multiple epidemic waves, then the resultant number of
cumulative cases is a superposition of the second epidemic law [Eq. (28)]. Similarly, an corollary can
be deduced for epidemic curves with multiple epidemic waves.
The three epidemic laws are confirmed with the COVID-19 data of cumulative cases from 18 countries
including undeveloped, developing and developed countries (Figs. 7 to 10). The three corollaries
agree with the time series data of daily new cases. Besides, the three laws and the three corollaries
are validated with the COVID-19 death data because of similarities of epidemic curves between daily
new cases and daily deaths (Figs. 7 to 10). To further validate the three epidemic laws, extensive
tests with other COVID-19 data, including the U.S. states data, and other epidemic data are required
in future studies.
Finally, we paved the way for future research to incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR
model.
