ABSTRACT

14

Objective: To assess whether mortality of patients admitted for covid-19 treatment was different in the

15

second UK epidemic wave of covid-19 compared to the first wave accounting for improvements in the

16

standard of care available and differences in the distribution of risk factors between the two waves.

17

Design: Single-centre, analytical, dynamic cohort study.

18

Participants: 2,701 adults (18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction

19

(PCR) and/or clinico-radiological diagnosis of covid-19, who required hospital admission to covid-19 specific

20

wards, between January 2020 and March 2021. There were 884 covid-19 admissions during the first wave

21

(before 30 Jun 2020) and 1,817 during the second wave.

22

Outcome measures: in-hospital covid-19 associated mortality, ascertained from clinical records and Medical

23

Certificate Cause of Death.

24

Results: The crude mortality rate was 25% lower during the second wave (2.23 and 1.66 deaths per 100

25

person-days in first and second wave respectively). However, after accounting for age, sex, dexamethasone,

26

oxygen requirements, symptoms at admission and Charlson Comorbidity Index, mortality hazard ratio

27

associated with covid-19 hospital admissions was 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.26, 2.08) times higher in

28

the second wave compared to the first.

29

Conclusions: Analysis of covid-19 admissions recorded in St. Georges Hospital, shows a larger second

30

epidemic wave, with a lower crude mortality in hospital admissions. Nevertheless, after accounting for other

31

factors underlying risk of death for covid-19 admissions was higher in the second wave. These findings are

32

temporally and ecologically correlated with an increased circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern

33

202012/1 (alpha).

INTRODUCTION

36

Since its emergence in December 2019, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has increased exponentially leading to the

37

declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, marking the

38

beginning of an outbreak that has posed immense challenges for health care systems across the globe [1].

39

The first confirmed case in the United Kingdom (UK) was registered on 31 January 2020. At the beginning of

40

March 2020, the growing transmission rates lead to the introduction of a series of control measures that

41

escalated to a full national lockdown (23 March 2020). This was subsequently followed by a drop in

42

transmission and hospitalisation rates with restrictions being eased over the summer months (Jun – Aug

43

2020). However, in October 2020 infections began to increase again leading to a second wave of covid-19

44

cases. The implementation of a second lockdown (04 November 2020) followed by tiered control measures,

45

in place until the beginning of March 2021, were needed to reduce the transmission rates again [2]. As of 01

46

May 2021, the UK has recorded 4,418,819 confirmed cases, 463,485 hospital admissions, and 127,571

47

deaths [3].

48
49

During the first wave of covid-19, relatively little was known about this novel illness and management was

50

largely based upon experience of treating other viral infections. However, since the start of the pandemic a

51

great deal has been learned about treatment of covid -19 and there have been several important changes to

52

the management of patients admitted with covid -19. From the start of the second wave, dexamethasone

53

was prescribed to all patients requiring supplemental oxygen and Remdesivir was administered to

54

hypoxemic patients presenting within 10 days of symptoms onset. The indications for Tocilizumab changed

55

during the second wave where patients initially had access to this only within clinical trials. Differences in the

56

management and standard of care across waves need to be accounted for when analysing covid-19 mortality

57

over time [4-8].

58

A key feature of the second wave of covid-19 in the UK, was the emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant

59

designated VOC 202012/01 or alpha (lineage B.1.1.7). This new variant was identified in December 2020 by

60

Public Health England through genomic sequencing of samples originally taken in south east England in early

61

October 2020. Since then, VOC 202012/01 has become the predominant variant circulating in the UK [9-11].

62

Several studies have established that VOC 202012/01 is more transmissible than pre-existing variants but its

63

impact on mortality has not been widely studied. To our knowledge, three studies have been recently

64

published, reporting an increase in mortality among those with a positive test in the community; however,

65

the impact on in-hospital mortality remains poorly understood [12-14].

66
67

St George’s University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is one of the largest hospitals in the UK and is based in

68

South West London. It serves a local catchment population of 560,000 and specialist services to 3.4 million

69

people. The objective of this study is to assess whether mortality of patients admitted for covid-19

70

treatment was different in the second UK wave of covid-19 compared to the first wave accounting for

71

differences in the standard of care available in each wave.

METHODS

73

Study design

74

This is a single-centre, analytical, dynamic cohort study using data extracted from routinely collected,

75

electronic medical records and hospital database.

76

Participants and setting

77

The study population for this cohort study comprised all adults (18 years) with SARS-CoV-2 infection

78

confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or clinico-radiological diagnosis of covid-19, who

79

required hospital admission to covid-19 specific wards at St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation

80

Trust (London, UK). Patients seen in the Emergency Department or in Acute Medical Units (AMU) who were

81

discharged on the same day were not included. Although covid-19 wards opened in March 2020, the study

82

period encompasses admissions between 01 Jan 2020 and 31 March 2021, as some of the early patients

83

admitted to covid-19 wards were already hospitalised. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria during the

84

study period were included in the cohort. There was no a priori study size calculation.

85

Data sources and measurement

86

The study cohort was identified retrospectively using hospital records of admissions to active covid-19

87

wards. These lists included patient identifiers, hospital admission date, ward and administrative information.

88

Respiratory and Intensive Care clinicians within the study team and involved in the care of covid-19 patients,

89

reviewed the electronic medical records for all the patients in the initial list, confirming criteria for covid-19

90

admission. In case of multiple covid-19 admissions, only the most severe, as defined by the highest

91

respiratory support needed, was included [15].

92

Study follow-up (from admission to discharge/outcome) was also carried out by clinicians, prospectively,

93

through review of electronic medical records. Patient data was extracted manually using a standardised

94

electronic questionnaire and was supervised by a senior clinician within the Respiratory team. These data

95

were also obtained through the informatic department and linked using hospital identifiers (laboratory,

96

pathology results and ethnicity data).

97

The follow-up period for this study began at admission and ended at outcome occurrence (death) or

98

censoring. Participants were censored at hospital discharge or at 6 months if admissions exceeded this

99

period (1 patient only).

100

PCR pathology results were available for all tests requested during the study period, so we matched these

101

with our cohort of patients. Those with positive PCR results dated at least 15 days after their hospital

102

admission were considered probable hospital acquired infections (HAI) and had the start of their follow-up

103

(time at risk) amended to be 14 days (maximum incubation period [16]) before the date of the positive PCR

104

result, instead of the actual admission day.

105

Variables

106

The outcome variable was in-hospital covid-19-associated mortality, ascertained from clinical records and

107

Medical Certificate Cause of Death (MCCD). The main explanatory variable for this analysis was covid-19

108

wave, and 31 June 2020 used as cut-off to separate both waves. First wave was used as baseline/reference.

109

Covariates of interest for this analysis included demographics (sex, age at admission, ethnicity), symptoms at

110

admission, Body Mass Index (BMI), treatment (dexamethasone, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab), oxygen

111

requirement, HFNO/CPAP (High Flow Nasal Oxygen/Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), invasive

112

ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, Clinical Frailty Score (CFS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI),

113

social history. Most variables were used in their original scale, others were recategorised using clinically

114

relevant categories with a sufficient number of participants in each group to avoid sparsity.

115

Where categorised, age groups in years were: [18,40), [40,60), [60,80), 80. BMI at admission was grouped

116

using categories derived from the WHO classification of BMI (in kg/m2): <18.5, [18.5,25), [25,30), 30[17].

117

Oxygen requirement was a dichotomous variable indicating whether the maximum FiO2 (Fraction of Inspired

118

Oxygen) was over 21%. ICU admission was defined as covid-19 pneumonitis admitted to ICU. Symptoms at

119

admission were respiratory or wider infective symptoms at time of presentation. The CFS level was collected

120

on a nine-point ordinal scale to assess frailty within two weeks of admission (1 being very fit, 2 well, 3

121

managing well, 4 vulnerable, 5 mildly frail, 6 moderately frail, 7 severely frail, 8 very severely frail, and 9

122

terminally ill); but to avoid sparsity categories 7 to 9 were grouped [18]. CFS was expanded to include all age

123

groups excepting those patients with disabilities which rendered it inappropriate. CCI is a widely used

124

comorbidity summary measure, based on age and a predefined number of conditions with an assigned

125

integer weight representing the severity of each condition; for this analysis scores of 8 or more were

126

grouped in one category [19]. All scores were calculated by clinicians experienced in the use of scales. Four

127

categories under social history reflected the level of assistance required for daily activities.

128

Statistical methods

129

The distribution of covariates was assessed for the entire cohort and across waves. Mortality rates and

130

person-time of observation were calculated for the main exposure groups and all covariates of interest. The

131

strength of the association was quantified using incidence rate ratios (IRR), and the statistical significance

132

using 95%CIs and p-values. Survival across the different waves was explored using time-to-event analysis and

133

log-rank to test the significance of the difference between the survival curves.

134

Cox regression was used to estimate the effect of wave on mortality adjusting for multiple covariates. The

135

proportional hazard assumption was explored graphically and by testing for a zero slope in Schoenfeld

136

residuals. Follow-up time was stratified using lexis expansion and to minimise bias, intervals were created so

137

they would contain the same number of events. The assumption of proportionality was supported.

138

A causal model was built using a stepwise backward approach where (non-forced) pre-defined covariates

139

were retained in the model unless there were problems with multicollinearity. Age and gender were

140

considered a priori confounders (forced variables). Age was fitted using restricted cubic splines, with knots

141

positioned so numbers of events between knots were approximately equally distributed. The full model

142

included age, gender and all variables found to confound the crude association between wave and mortality

143

(non-forced variables). A change in the magnitude  5.5% was considered an indication of confounding. ICU

144

admission was included in the model as a non-forced variable regardless of the degree of confounding of the

145

main association. Problems will multicollinearity on the main effect in the full model, were resolved using

146

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) reduction for backward deletion of non-forced variables. The RMSE for the

147

full model was used as reference for each step; and RMSE for each reduced model was calculated as √[〖〖

148

(𝛽〗_(1 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑) − 𝛽_(1 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙))〗^2 + 〖𝑆𝐸〗_𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑^2][20].

149

Following the same methodology, we carried out a sub-analysis among those requiring ICU admission. Data

150

management and statistical analysis were carried out using R.

RESULTS

156

Between 01 January 2020 and 31 March 2021, there were 3,376 covid-19 positive adult patients registered

157

at St. Georges Hospital. Of these, 2,701 were patients admitted to covid-19 wards for treatment, all of whom

158

were included. 32.7% (884) in the first wave and 67.3% (1,817) in the second wave (Figure 1). At the time of

159

database cut-off (23 May 2021), there were 16 patients with no outcome recorded.

160
161

The distribution of characteristics at admission for the entire cohort and across waves is shown in Table 1.

162

Covid-19 patients admitted during the second wave, were more likely to be younger, with patients aged 40

163

to 60 years being more prevalent in the second wave (495, 27.2%) and patients aged over 80 years being

164

more prevalent in the first wave (273, 30.9%). The distribution of sex was similar for both waves with males

165

being overrepresented (57.6%). During the second wave, patients were more likely to lead an independent

166

life (1,101, 61.1%) or have some level of family assistance (369, 20.5%); intermediate levels of frailty (3

167

managing well, 4 vulnerable, 5 mildly frail) were also more prevalent in the second wave (1,103, 60.7%) than

168

in the first wave (392, 44.3%). The proportion of severely frail patients (CFS 7-9) admitted was lower in the

169

second wave (197, 10.8% vs. 164, 18.6% in the first wave). Admissions scoring 0-3 in CCI were more

170

prevalent during the second wave (891, 49.0% vs. 386, 43.7%); the reverse occurred for CCI scores 4-5 and

171

over 6 (29.3% and 27.0% respectively for first wave, vs. 25.3% and 25.7% for second wave). Absence of

172

respiratory or wider infective symptoms at onset (initial diagnosis through PCR) was more prevalent in the

173

second wave (361, 19.9%) compared to the first wave (50, 5.7%).

174

The distribution of medical interventions after admission are listed in Table 2. The prevalence of admitted

175

patients requiring oxygen during admission was similar in both waves: 76.3% (668) in the first wave and

176

73.5% (1,328) in the second wave. The use of HFNO/CPAP was more prevalent in the second wave (400,

177

22.2%) than during the first wave (81, 9.3%), whilst invasive ventilation was more prevalent in the first wave.

178

The distribution of patients requiring ICU admission had a similar distribution across waves (23.1%). The use

179

of dexamethasone, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab was almost exclusively during the second wave. During the

180

first wave there was some use of Tocilizumab (23, 2.6%) and dexamethasone (58, 6.6%), both used in the

181

context of clinical trials (with a few cases additional cases of compassionate use for Tocilizumab).

182
183

A total of 752 patients died over the total time at risk (40,777 person-days); 297 (33.6%) deaths occurred

184

during the first wave and 455 (25.3%) during the second wave. The median time of follow-up for those

185

discharged was 10 days (IQR: 5-22 days) and for those who died was 11 days (IQR: 5-19 days). We found no

186

differences in the overall distribution of the follow-up time across waves. Among those discharged,

187

admissions with lengths of stay (LOS) over 35 days were similar across waves (11.9% for the first wave and

188

11.1% for the second); LOS between 0-7 days were more prevalent in the second wave (562, 41.8%) than in

189

the first wave (188, 32.0%). The median probability of survival was 29 days (95%CI 30-41 days) for the first

190

wave, and 37 days (95%CI 32-47 days) for the second.

191

In this cohort, patients admitted during the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic, had a (crude) mortality

192

rate 25% lower than that of patients admitted during the first wave (IRR 0.75, 95%CI 0.64, 0.86). Mortality

193

rates, and crude IRR for all variables of interest are shown in table 1 of the supplemental materials. Overall,

194

mortality rates were 1.19 times higher in men than in women (95%CI 1.03, 1.38) and 1.37 times higher in

195

patients of Asian ethnicity compared to white ethnicity (95%CI 1.12, 1.67). Crude IRR was 1.92 times higher

196

(95%CI 1.27, 3.09) among those aged 60-79 years, and 2.81 times (95%CI 1.85, 4.50) in those aged over 80

197

years compared to patients younger than 40 years. Mortality rates for patients with some degree of family

198

assistance was 1.69 higher (95%CI 1.42, 2.02) than those living an independent life. Further, IRR was 1.30

199

(95%CI 1.06, 1.59) for patients with formal social assistance and 2.13 (95%CI 1.68, 2.67) for those living in

200

care homes.

201

Mortality increased with increasing levels of frailty (CFS and CCI). The mortality rate among those with

202

oxygen requirement was 2.43 per 100 persons-day (95%CI 2.26, 2.61); there were very few deaths among

203

those not requiring oxygen (n=11), and all these occurred in patients who did not develop breathlessness

204

and died of an alternate cause (despite having covid-19 infection).

205
206

Table 3 shows the crude and adjusted IRR (IRRa) for the effect of wave on mortality on the same set of

207

observations. The strongest confounders of the association in this cohort were dexamethasone, oxygen

208

requirement, symptomatic at admission, CCI, and HFNO/CPAP. In all cases, removing the effect of the

209

confounder (IRRa) retained the protective effect of second wave to different degrees. Mortality was 43%

210

(95%CI 71%, 52%) lower in the second wave compared to the first wave when adjusting for the effect of

211

dexamethasone; and 16% (95%CI 3%, 27%) lower when adjusting for oxygen requirement. Thus, oxygen

212

requirement is acting as partial positive confounder whereas dexamethasone is acting as a negative

213

confounder in this cohort.

214

In the multivariable analysis, the hazard of death during the second wave was 1.62 times higher (95%CI 1.26,

215

2.08) than during the first wave, after conditioning on age, sex, dexamethasone, oxygen requirement,

216

symptoms at admission, and CCI. With age fitted as a flexible spline, and accounting for all the variables in

217

this model, males had HR 1.21 (95%CI 1.04, 1.40); those presenting with symptoms at admission a HR 1.72

218

(95%CI 1.35, 2.20) and increasing CCI was (non-linearly) associated with increasing hazards of death.

219

Dexamethasone reduced the hazard of death by 53% (95%CI 40%, 63%) when accounting for all the other

220

factors in the model.

221

In the subgroup analyses of covid-19 patients requiring ICU, the hazard of death during the second wave was

222

2.00 (95%CI 1.10, 3.62) after conditioning on age, sex, dexamethasone, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, and

223

HFNO/CPAP. A summary of model development is presented in the supplemental materials.

225

DISCUSSION

226

This cohort study examined differences in the risk of death of patients requiring in-hospital treatment for

227

covid-19, during the first and second wave of the covid-19 pandemic in UK.

228

The number of covid-19 admissions was 2.05 times higher in second wave compared to the first wave (1,817

229

vs. 884); the proportion of admitted covid-19 patients who died was 33.6% (297 of 884) during the first wave

230

and 25.3% (455 of 1,346) during the second wave. The crude mortality rate was 25% (95%CI 14%, 36%)

231

lower for those admitted during the second wave compared to those admitted during the first wave (IRR

232

0.75 95%CI 0.64, 0.86).

233

We summarised the distribution of baseline characteristics at admission and medical interventions across

234

waves for the entire study cohort (Table 1). During the second wave, younger admissions with moderate

235

levels of frailty/CCI were more prevalent, compared to either older and/or frailer patients in the first wave.

236

In addition to this, during the second wave, we observed an increase of covid-19 specific treatments as trial

237

data emerged for the use of dexamethasone, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab.

238

The multivariable analysis attempted to account for all the available factors unequally distributed across

239

waves and also associated with mortality (while avoiding multicollinearity in the model). We found a 1.62-

240

fold increase in the hazard of death (95%CI 1.26, 2.08), after controlling for the effect of age, sex,

241

dexamethasone, oxygen requirement (maximum FiO2>21%), symptoms at admission and CCI.

242

Dexamethasone therapy and oxygen requirement were strong confounders of the association of interest

243

and removing either variable from the model would cause a change in the direction of the main effect. This

244

is explained by an unequal distribution of two highly correlated covariates across waves. Oxygen and

245

dexamethasone administration are correlated in that, the benefits of dexamethasone in the management of

246

covid-19 hospitalised patients have been shown only for patients with hypoxaemia, but not among those

247

with milder disease (without hypoxaemia) [21, 22]. However, this correlation, was only observed in the

248

second wave in accordance with changes in the standard of care as evidence became available. In this

249

cohort, the observed proportion of those who survived among those receiving both oxygen and

250

dexamethasone was similar across waves: 75.5% (37 of 51) during the first wave, and 70.5% (866 of 1,228)

251

during the second wave. But, as shown in Table 2, the distribution of both interventions was different across

252

waves: in the first wave 76.3% (668 of 875) of those admitted required oxygen but 6.6% (58 of 884) received

253

dexamethasone; in the second wave 73.5% (1,328 of 1,806) received oxygen and 68.3% (1,241 of 1,817)

254

dexamethasone. Both variables were included in the model as the level of uncontrolled confounding

255

reduced was larger than the error introduced due to collinear effects. After accounting for the effect of age,

256

sex, dexamethasone, oxygen requirement, symptoms at admission, CCI and wave, dexamethasone reduced

257

the hazard of death in this population of patients by 53% (95%CI 40%, 63%).

258

We further explored the effect of wave on mortality on the subpopulation of patients admitted to ICU, i.e.,

259

the most severe covid-19 patients. All these patients had oxygen therapy so, this variable was not a factor in

260

the main model. Within this sub-group of patients, the hazard of death during the second wave was also

261

larger than in the first wave (HR: 2.00, 95%CI 1.10, 3.62) after accounting for the effect of age, sex,

262

dexamethasone, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and HFNO/CPAP. This further supports the observation that risk of

263

death in covid-19 hospitalised patients was higher in the second wave compared to the first wave, when

264

differences in the standard of care and the characteristics of the patients were taken into account.

265

There is some evidence that VOC 202012/01 (alpha) is associated with increased risk of death [12-14]; but

266

since S-gene target failure (SGTF) detection or genomic sequencing data were not available for this study

267

population, attributing our observation of increased in-hospital mortality to variant VOC 202012/01 would

268

largely depend on the acceptability of the assumption that said variant was dominant in our catchment area.

269

This might not be an unreasonable assumption as prevalence of SGTF (associated with this new variant), was

270

already at 5.8% at the beginning of November 2020, increasing sharply to reach 94.3% at the end of January

271

2021 [13].

272

Strengths and limitations

273

This was a large analytical cohort study comparing groups of patients at different points in time. The overall

274

goal was to investigate if different standards of care and possible changes in the natural history of the

275

disease (attributed to changes in SARS-CoV-2 variants), had an impact on in-hospital mortality. We included

276

all patients admitted to covid-19 wards for treatment.

277

All variables used in this study were extracted prospectively from electronic medical records ensuring data

278

collected were the same across waves. The majority of the data were collected by experienced respiratory

279

and ICU clinicians, and although some data inconsistencies were rectified early during data management,

280

misclassification of covariates due transcription errors cannot be ruled out. Laboratory variables such as

281

oxygenation parameters were obtained through the informatic department, but due to the limited quality of

282

the electronic records, data were inconsistent and, in many cases, missing. We dichotomised this variable

283

(FiO2) in an effort to reduce measurement error, but the coarse categorisation of oxygenation parameters

284

into a dichotomous variable is likely to have introduced residual confounding.

285

Outcome and date of outcome were collected separately and ascertained from MCCD (available for 752

286

deaths, 94.1%). The number of deaths we observed during the first wave is consistent with numbers

287

previously reported for the same catchment area and period [23]. However, it has been observed that

288

during the first epidemic wave in the UK there was a larger mortality within care homes [2], so it is possible

289

that we have underestimated the number of deaths in the first wave. This differential misclassification of

290

outcome could have led to an overestimation of the effect of the second wave. In addition, temporal effects

291

could also have explained some of the observed differences between waves, as fatality rates are known to

292

be higher during winter months, when the second wave unfolded. Overall, there was a good level of data

293

completeness with only BMI observing large numbers of missing values.

294

Generalisability

295

This study was looking at an overall population of hospitalised adults with covid-19 in a large reference

296

teaching London hospital. Findings are only generalisable to inpatient population.

CONCLUSIONS

298

Analysis of covid-19 admissions recorded in St. Georges Hospital between 01 Jan 2020 and 31 March 2021,

299

shows a second epidemic wave twice as large as the first one. Although crude rates would indicate a lower

300

in-hospital mortality during the second wave; accounting for differences in the distribution of protective and

301

risk factors (age, sex, dexamethasone use, oxygen requirement, symptoms at admission and comorbidities),

302

suggests a higher risk of death during the second epidemic wave compared to the first. Our findings are

303

temporally and ecologically correlated with an increased circulation of VOC 202012/01 (alpha), with

304

estimates in agreement community-based studies. The availability of improved management and new

305

treatments, particularly dexamethasone, was important in reducing risk of death during the second wave.

306

This study illustrates the importance of careful clinical studies to understand risks of mortality in any future

307

waves of covid-19.
