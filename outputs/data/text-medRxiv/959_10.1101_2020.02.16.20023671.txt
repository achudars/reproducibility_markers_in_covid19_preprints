Abstract
Background: The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of
patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and their correlation with the
disease severity remain unclear.

Methods: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed
COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and
cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays.

Results: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant
and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than
27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T
cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ
levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases.
T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the
disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to
those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were
identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe
COVID-19.

Conclusions: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is
higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the
disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification
of severe COVID-19 cases.

Introduction
First reported in Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019, an ongoing outbreak of a viral
pneumonia in humans has raised acute and grave global concern. The causative
pathogen was rapidly identified as a novel β-coronavirus, which has since been
formally named as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. According
to the daily report of the National Health Commission of China, the epidemic of
SARS-CoV-2 has so far caused 57,416 confirmed cases, including 11,272 severe
cases, and 1,665 deaths in China by February 15th, 2020[1]. The disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2 has been recently named as the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19)
by the World Health Organization. Previous studies about the epidemiological and
clinical characteristics of COVID-19 showed patients with COVID-19 may develop
either mild or severe symptoms of acute respiratory infection, while the mild patients
show symptoms of fever, dry cough, fatigue, abnormal chest CT findings but with a
good prognosis[2,3]. In contrast, some patients develop severe pneumonia, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, with death rates
ranging from between 4.3% to 15% according to different study reports[2,4].

Lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storm are typical laboratory abnormalities
observed during highly pathogenic coronavirus infections, such as the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections, and are believed to be associated
with disease severities[5,6]. Recent studies have also reported decreases in the counts
of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and increases in serum inflammatory cytokine

levels in COVID-19 patients[4,7]. However, it has remained largely unclear how
different lymphocyte subsets and the kinetics of inflammatory cytokines change in the
peripheral blood during COVID-19. In this study, we longitudinally characterized the
changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles in the peripheral blood of
COVID-19 patients with distinct disease severities.

Methods

Data collection
A written informed consent was regularly obtained from all patients upon admission
into Wuhan Union Hospital, China. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The
40 confirmed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Union Hospital during January 5 to
January 24, 2020 were enrolled into this retrospective single-center study. All medical
record information including epidemiological, demographic, clinical manifestation,
laboratory data, and outcome data were obtained. All data were checked by a team of
trained physicians.

Laboratory examination
Laboratory confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 was performed by local CDC according
to Chinese CDC protocol. Throat-swab specimens were collected from all patients
and the samples were maintained in viral-transport medium for laboratory testing. An
infection with other respiratory viruses including influenza A virus, influenza B virus,
Coxsackie virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus and enterovirus was
excluded by real-time RT-PCR. Specimens, including sputum or alveolar lavatory
fluid, blood, urine, and feces, were cultured to identify pathogenic bacteria or fungi
that may be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The specific IgG and IgM of
Chlamydia

pneumonia

and

Mycoplasma

pneumonia

were

detected

by

chemiluminescence immunoassay. The lymphocyte test kit (Beckman Coulter Inc., FL,
USA) was used for lymphocyte subset analysis. Plasma cytokines (IL2, IL4, IL6,
IL10, TNF - α and IFN - γ) were detected with human Th1/2 cytokine kit II (BD Ltd.,
Franklin lakes, NJ, USA). All tests are performed according to the product manual.

Statistical analyses
Classification variables are expressed in frequency or percentage, and significance is
detected by chi square or Fisher’s exact test. The quantized variables of parameters
are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and the significance is tested by t-test.
Nonparametric variables were expressed in median and quartile intervals, and
significance was tested by Mann Whitney U or Kruskal Wallis test. Data (nonnormal
distribution) from repeated measures were compared using the generalized linear
mixed model. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all statistical
analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the major
contributing factors among clinical parameters to distinguish mild and severe cases of
COVID-19 patients. The diagnostic values of selected parameters for differentiating
mild and severe cases of COVID-19 patients were assessed by receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). SPSS statistical software
(Macintosh version 26.0, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and R package are used for
statistical analysis.

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients
The diagnosis of COVID-19 for patients was performed according to the Guidelines
of the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 5) published
by the National Health Commission of China. Mild patients met all following
conditions: (1) Epidemiology history, (2) Fever or other respiratory symptoms, (3)
Typical CT image abnormities of viral pneumonia, and (4) Positive result of RT-PCR
for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Severe patients additionally met at least one of the following
conditions: (1) Shortness of breath, RR≥30 times/min, (2) Oxygen saturation (Resting
state) ≤93%, or (3) PaO2 / FiO2 ≤300mmHg. A total of 40 patients were enrolled in
this study, which were all Wuhan residents and laboratory confirmed cases. The
patients were divided into two groups according to above-mentioned conditions,
including 27 mild cases (67.5%) and 13 severe cases (32.5%). Two patients in the
severe group died on day 15 and 21 after disease onset.

The enrolled COVID-19 patients consisted of 15 males (37.5%) and 25 females
(62.5%) (Table 1). Only 3 patients (7.5%) had an exposure history (shopping) on the
Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The medium age of the patients was 48.7 ± 13.9
years old. The ages of the severe patient group (59.7 ± 10.1 years) were older than
that of the mild group (43.2 ± 12.3 years). A total of 14 (35%) patients in both groups
had basic diseases, including diabetes (6 [15%]), hypertension (6 [15%]), pituitary
adenoma (2 [5%]), thyroid disease (2 [5%]) and tumor disease (2 [5%]). Four severe
patients had mixed fungal infection and 1 severe patient had mixed bacterial infection
(Table 1). All severe patients and 85.2% of the mild patients had fever, while no
significant difference in the degrees of temperature was observed between the two
groups (Table 1). The severe patients showed significantly higher frequencies in the
occurrence of sputum production (p=0.032), myalgia (p=0.041) and nausea (p=0.029)

(Table 1). The levels of fibrinogen (p<0.001), D-dimer (P=0.008), total bilirubin
(p=0.007), aspartate transaminase (p<0.001), alanine transaminase (p=0.004), lactate
dehydrogenase (p<0.001), creatine kinase (p=0.010), C-reactive protein (p=0.006),
ferritin (p=0.015) and serum amyloid A protein (SAA, p=0.003) in the peripheral
blood of the severe patients were significantly higher at admission compared to the
mild patients (Table 2). No significant differences in the serum levels of
immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM), complement C3 or C4 were observed between
the two groups (Table 2).

Kinetic analysis of lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of COVID-19
patients
Lymphopenia was observed in 44.4% (12/27) of mild patients and 84.6% (11/13) of
severe patients at the onset of the disease. As shown in Table 2, the absolute counts of
lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the severe patients was significantly lower,
while the absolute counts of total white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils were
significantly higher, than those of the mild patients at the time of hospital admission.
No significant difference in monocyte counts was observed between the two groups
(Table 2). Next, we analyzed the kinetic changes of WBCs, neutrophils and
monocytes as well as different lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of
COVID-19 patients from the disease onset to at least 16 days later. The two
mortalities in the severe group were excluded from the analysis due to the lack of
kinetic data. Significant increases in total WBCs counts in the severe group were only
observed at the time point of onset (within 3 days) but not during the following period
of disease progression compared to the mild group (Figure 1A). Significant increases
in neutrophil counts of the severe group were observed not only at the time point of
disease onset, but also at 13-15 days after compared to the mild group (Figure 1B). In
contrast, a sustained decrease in lymphocyte counts of the severe group was observed

compared to those of the mild patients. The difference was significant at the time
point of disease onset and became even greater on 4-6 days later (Figure 1C). From
7-15 days after disease onset, the lymphocyte counts gradually increased in the severe
group, and reached a comparable level to that of the mild patients at 16 days after
disease onset (Figure 1C). No significant differences in monocyte counts were
observed between the two groups during the whole observation period (Figure 1D).

In order to further determine the kinetic changes of different lymphocyte subsets in
the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, we performed flow cytometry to stain
CD3+ T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, B cells and NK cells. Similar to the
findings for lymphocytes, sustained decreases in CD3, CD8 and CD4 T cell counts
was observed in the severe group compared to those of the mild patients during
clinical observation (Figure 2A-C, Supplementary figure 1). The lowest CD3, CD4
and CD8 T cell counts were observed at 4-6 days after disease onset (Figure 2A-C).
The differences in CD3 and CD8 T cell counts between the two groups were
significant at the time points of disease onset and 7-9 days later (Figure 2A and 2C).
However, the differences in CD4 T cell counts between the two groups did not reach a
statistical significance at any time point (Figure 2C). The T cell counts started to
gradually increase in the severe group starting at 7 days after disease onset, and
reached comparable levels to those in the mild patients on day 16 after disease onset
(Figure 2A-C). No significant differences in B cell and NK cell counts were observed
between the two groups during the whole course of the disease (Figure 2D and 2E).

Kinetic analysis of inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum of COVID-19
patients
A previous study demonstrated changes in inflammatory cytokine levels, such as IL-2,

IL-7, IL-10, and TNF-α, in the serum of COVID-19 patients[2]. Therefore, we further
characterized the kinetic changes of inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-2,
IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-α, in the serum of our patient cohort. Fluctuations
in the serum levels of these cytokines in the mild patient group were minor. In
contrast, the severe patient group showed more significant fluctuations in the serum
levels of these cytokines (Figure 3). All examined cytokines, except IL-6, reached
their peak levels in the serum at 3-6 days after disease onset (Figure 3). Both IL-6 and
IL-10 levels showed sustained increases in the severe group compared to the mild
group (Figure 3A and 3B). A decease in serum IL-6 levels in the severe group started
at 16 days after disease onset, and IL-10 levels were lowest at 13 days after disease
onset (Figure 3A and 3B). Significant increases in serum IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the
severe group were only observed at 4-6 days after disease onset (Figure 3C and 3F).
No significant differences in IL4 and TNF-α levels were observed between the two
groups during the whole course of the disease (Figure 3D and 3E). All examined
cytokines reached similar levels between the severe and mild patient groups at 16
days after disease onset (Figure 3).

Prognostic factors for identification of severe COVID-19 cases
Next, we examined the possibilities of using above-mentioned parameters as
prognostic factors for identifying severe cases in COVID-19 patients. PCA was firstly
performed by R package “factoextra” to identify correlated variables for
distinguishing severe patients from mild patients (Figure 4A). Four mostly
contributing

variables,

neutrophil-to-CD8+

ratio

(N8R),

neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil counts (NEC) and White Blood
Cells counts (WBCC) were selected as potential prognostic factors for further detailed

calculated by R package “pROC” (Figure 4B). The results of this analysis identified
N8R with a higher AUC (0.94) than NLR (0.93), NE (0.91) and WBC (0.85).
Simultaneously, the cutoff values were calculated from the ROC curves, with a value
of 21.9 for N8R (Specificity: 92.6%, Sensitivity: 84.6%), 5.0 for NLR (96.3%,
84.6%), 3.2 for NE (81.5%, 84.6%) and 4.3 for WBC (74.1%, 84.6%) (Figure 4B).
The further univariate analysis including the 4 factors of N8R>21.9, NLR>5.0,
NE>3.2 and WBC>4.3 were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) between severe and
mild groups. The results were obtained for NLR (OR: 143, 95% Cl: 11.72-1745.3),
N8R (OR: 68.75, 95% Cl: 8.55-552.68), NE (OR: 22, 95% Cl: 3.646-132.735) and
WBC (OR: 55, 95% Cl: 6.779-446.23) with our patient cohort as predictive factors for
severe COVID-19.

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the clinical features and immunological characteristics of
peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19. Although the majority of the patients did
not have an exposure history of the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the clinical
characteristics of these patients are very similar to those reported in previous
studies[2,4,7]. The ages of severe patients are older, and the proportion of underlying
diseases is higher, and co-infection also occurs in severe patients. Recent reports show
that the lymphocyte counts are normal in COVID-19 patients with mild diseases. In
contrast, 63%-70.3% of patients with severe diseases have lymphopenia and the
lymphocyte counts in patients with a mortal outcome remain at a low level[4,8]. Our
study also confirmed higher rates of developing lymphopenia in severe patients than
in mild patients (84.6% vs 44.4%). We found that the development of lymphopenia in
severe patients was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T
cells, especially CD8+ T cells, but not to B cells and NK cells. The decrease of T cells
in the severe patient group reaches its peak within the first week during the disease
course, and then T cell numbers gradually increase from the second week and recover
to a comparable level to that of the mild patient group in the third week. All these
severe patients included in our study survived the disease, and thus we speculate this
course is associated with a favorable outcome in severe COVID-19 patients.

Previous researches on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections have demonstrated the
correlation between T cell counts and the severity of the diseases, as well as explored
the possible mechanisms[9]. It has been shown that the acute SARS-CoV infection
was associated with marked lymphopenia in about 80% of patients, including a
dramatic loss of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in comparison with healthy control
individuals[10-12]. Decreases in T cell numbers are strongly correlated with the

severity of acute phase of SARS disease in patients[11,13]. Lymphopenia is also
observed in MERS-CoV infected patients. A detailed clinical study showed that 14 %
of MERS patients had leukopenia, while 34 % of the patients had lymphopenia[14].
The mechanism of developing lymphopenia may differ in SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV infections. SARS-CoV cannot productively infect T cells, however,
altered antigen presenting cells (APC) function and impaired dendritic cells migration
during SARS-CoV infection may result in insufficient T cell priming and thus
contribute to decreased numbers of virus-specific T cells in the lungs[15,16].
Moreover, delayed type I interferon response or inflammatory monocyte-macrophages
derived pro-inflammatory cytokines could also sensitize T cells to undergo
apoptosis[17]. In contrast, MERS-CoV was found to be able to infect many human
immune cells, including dendritic cells[18], macrophages[19], and T cells[20].
MERS-CoV infection of T cells results in apoptosis mediated by a combination of
extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, which is believed to contribute to virus
spread and the severe immunopathology[20]. So far, it remains unclear whether
SARS-CoV-2 induced T cell contraction is the result of a direct T cell infection or an
indirect effect cause by the virus, such as APC function disorder or overactive
inflammatory responses. Further studies are needed to investigate the corresponding
mechanisms in detail.

Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such
as IFN-γ, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8, are associated with severe lung injury and adverse
outcomes of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection[6,18,19,21]. Our results also
demonstrate that severe COVID-19 patients have higher concentrations of IL6, IL10,
IL2 and IFN-γ in the serum than mild cases, suggesting that the magnitude of
15

cytokine storm is associated with the disease severity. Additionally, T cells are
important for dampening overactive innate immune responses during viral
infection[22,23]. Thus, loss of T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection may result in
aggravated inflammatory responses, while restoring T cell numbers may alleviate
them. In line with this hypothesis, we observed that the kinetic changes of T cell
counts are reversely correlated with the kinetic changes of most examined cytokine
levels in the peripheral blood in severe COVID-19 patients. While T cell counts drop
to their lowest levels at 4-6 days after disease onset, serum IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α
and IFN-γ levels reach their peaks. The courses of restoring T cell numbers are
associated with decreases of serum IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels.

Early identification of risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients may facilitate
appropriate supportive care and promptly access to the intensive care unit if necessary.
A recent study in a 61-patient cohort reported that the NLR was the most useful
prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19[24]. The severity of
pathological injury during SARS or MERS correlates with the extensive infiltration of
neutrophils in the lung and increased neutrophil numbers in the peripheral blood[17].
Thus, the magnitude of increase in neutrophil counts may suggest the intensity of
inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients. Besides, the magnitude of decrease in
lymphocyte counts also indicates the extend of the impairment of immune system by
the viral infection. Therefore, NLR may serve as a useful factor to reflect the intensity
of imbalance of inflammation and immune responses in COVID-19 patients. In this
study, we also screened the potential prognostic factors affecting incidence of severe
illness in our patient cohort. Based on our findings with analyzing lymphocyte subsets,
we further included the ratio of neutrophils to different lymphocyte subsets as
parameters. Our kinetic analysis revealed that CD8+ T cells are the major lymphocyte
subset which decreases in cell numbers during COVID-19. In line with this finding,

our results demonstrate that N8R has even better performance with a higher AUC
value than NLR in the ROC curve analysis, and may serve as a more powerful factor
than NLR for predicting the severe illness incidence in COVID patients.

In summary, our study of immunological characteristics of the peripheral blood in
COVID-19 patients shows that the numbers of neutrophils and T cells, especially
CD8+ T cells, as well as the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood
is dynamically correlated with the severity of the disease. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to describe the kinetic changes of lymphocyte subsets
and cytokine profiles in COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we identified N8R and NLR
as powerful prognostic factors for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.
This work may help to achieve a better understanding of immune function disorder as
well as immunopathogenesis during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

(A) Principal component analysis was performed by R package “factoextra” to

32

identify correlated variables for distinguishing severe patients from mild COVID-19

33

patients. Four mostly contributing variables, neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R),

34

neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil counts (NE) and White Blood Cells

35

counts (WBC) were identified. (B) ROC curve and AUC were calculated for these 4

36

selected parameters by using R package “pROC”.

37

analysis including the 4 factors of N8R>21.9, NLR>5.0, NE>3.2 and WBC>4.3 was

38

used to calculate OR. The results were obtained for NLR (OR:143, 95%

39

Cl:11.72-1745.3), N8R (OR:68.75, 95% Cl:8.55-552.68), NE (OR:22, 95% Cl:

40

3.646-132.735) and WBC (OR:55, 95% Cl:6.779-446.23).
