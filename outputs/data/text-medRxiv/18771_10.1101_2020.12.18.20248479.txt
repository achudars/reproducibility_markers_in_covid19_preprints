Abstract: Antibody surveillance provides essential information for public health officials to work
with communities to discuss the spread and impact of COVID-19 in communities. At the state of
the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in the
diagnostic testing was limited with many asymptomatic cases. Irrespective of symptom severity,
antibodies develop within two to three weeks after disease onset and may persist 6 months or
more, antibody surveillance is an important tool for tracking trends in past infections across
diverse populations. This study includes adults and children recruited from a statewide sample
of past 2014-2020 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) participants. SHOW, an ongoing
population-based health examination study including a randomly selected sample of
households, partnered with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the Wisconsin
State Laboratory of Hygiene to conduct longitudinal antibody surveillance using the Abbott
Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test. WAVEs I and II of three planned WAVES were
complete in mid-summer to late fall respectively, WAVE III is planned for early 2021. From
WAVE I to WAVE II, crude estimates of seroprevalence in the total study population increased
four to five-fold from 1.9% to 7.3%. Within the statewide probability sample, weighted estimates
increased from an estimated 1.6% (95% CI:0.6-2.5%) seropositivity to 6.8% (95% CI:4.3-9.4%).
Seroprevalence varied by health region in both waves, and significant disparities in smaller
population groups were identified. Although there was no gender difference observed in WAVE
I, seropositivity rates was higher in men 9.4% (95% CI:4.3, 14.3) compared to women 4.3%
(2.7-5.3%) in WAVE II. This public health and academic partnership provides critical data for
public health response to the pandemic and lays the foundation for future research into longerterm immunity, health impacts and population level disparities.

Background: In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized as a significant public health
threat in March of 2020. Scaling up of diagnostic testing was slow at the start, particularly in
non-urban settings and non-hospitalized individuals. Community spread is linked to many
asymptomatic or mild cases[1]. Consequently, case counts based on antigen testing alone likely
underestimate the true number of infections. Antibodies develop within two to three weeks after
disease onset [2] for SARS-CoV-2 and may persist 6 months or more in some individuals[3-5] or
may decline within 3-5 months after infection[6-10]. By providing an indication of past infection,
antibody surveillance therefore provides a means to examine trends in antibody prevalence in
the population over time [11].
Methods: This study includes a longitudinal sample of adults recruited from the statewide
Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) study. Individuals were eligible if they had
participated in SHOW health examination protocols between 2014-2016 or were included in the
special population oversample conducted in the city of Milwaukee during 2018-2019. This
antibody surveillance study was designed in partnership with the Wisconsin Department of
Health Services (DHS).
Three waves of repeated blood sample collection among SHOW participants were planned
across the entire state. WAVE I collection occurred in early July through August 2020; WAVE II
began in late October and continued through early December. WAVE III is planned for early
2021. Twelve sample collection sites were identified across Wisconsin (e.g., health
departments, churches, and community-based organizations). Both urban and rural locations
were included. Data collection was conducted in English except for one site in Milwaukee that
offered Spanish interpreters. Each site was equipped with a small cooler and centrifuge.
Participants were screened for fever, COVID-19 symptoms and known past exposures. Those
with active COVID-19 infection or COVID-19 exposure within the past 2 weeks were excluded.
Blood samples were collected by trained phlebotomists and processed in the field. . The
samples were then collected by currier each evening and sent immediately to the Wisconsin
State Laboratory of Hygiene, where they were processed using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody test, with estimated specificity of 99.6%[11, 12]. The statewide surveillance was
deemed public health exempt, however, additional approval included consent for use of data
and additional sample collection for future COVID-19 research was approved by the University
of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB). Further details on study
protocols are available from study investigators.
Findings: A total of 1056 individuals were tested in WAVE I and 1070 in WAVE II,
corresponding to an average response rate of 39-40% among all eligible participants. Of these,
996 WAVE I and 994 WAVE II participants were in the original statewide population-based
probability sample and were used to estimate weighted statewide estimates reported in Table 1.
From WAVE I to WAVE II, crude estimates of seroprevalence in the total study population
increased from 1.9% to 7.3%. Within the statewide probability sample, weighted estimates
increased from an estimated 1.6% (95% CI:0.6-2.5%) seropositivity to 6.8% (95% CI:4.3-9.4%).
Seroprevalence varied by health region in both waves. Although there was no gender difference
observed in WAVE I, seropositivity rates was higher in men 9.4% (95% CI:4.3, 14.3) compared
to women 4.3% (2.7-5.3%) in WAVE II. Health regions are defined by the Wisconsin
Department of Health Services to represent geographic service areas for local and state public
health practitioners. In WAVE I, the greatest proportion of positive tests was detected in the
Southeastern region of the state, home to Milwaukee, the largest metropolitan area in the state
(3.1% positive; 95% CI:1.4-4.9%); this increased to 9.3% (95% CI:3.3-15.1%) in WAVE II.

The greatest change in antibody-positive results from WAVE I to WAVE II was in the North and
Northeast from 1.7% (0.0-4.3%) to 8.7% (95% CI: 5.0-12.4%). Prevalence also varied by age
and race-ethnicity with the highest WAVE II prevalence among 45-64 year-olds at 8.1% (5.610.7%) up from 1.9% positive in WAVE I and compared to 6.1% (1.5-10.8%) among participants
younger than 44 and 6.4% positive (3.3-9.5%) in those older than 65. Self-identified Non-whites
(n=133) also had a higher prevalence of 8.3 (0.3-16.4%) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites
(n=861) with 6.5% (3.8-9.2%). Among the non-white participants, n=55 were among a LatinX
population oversample recruited from a largely industrial and working-class community on
Milwaukee's south side. Of these individuals, over 25% had positive antibodies measured
during WAVE II.
A total of 876 individuals participated in both WAVE I and WAVE II. Of the 18 that tested
positive for antibodies in WAVE I and participated in WAVE II, 6 (33%) had a negative antibody
test in WAVE II.
There were 67 participants 18 years of age or younger in WAVE I and 80 in WAVE II. No
children were positive in the WAVE I, the prevalence on among child participants in WAVE II
was 10%.
Interpretation: Results show an overall four to fivefold increase in the prevalence of antibodies
across the state of Wisconsin from the first sample collection in July and August to the second
sample collection in later October through early December. Regional variation in trends is
consistent with statewide testing results and mirror the overall trends in COVID-19 infections in
Wisconsin. The antibody testing suggests that as of early November 2020, just prior to a second
statewide spike in COVID-19 infections, over 90% of the state's population did not have SARSCoV-2 antibodies (whether because of lack of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or because infection
had occurred, but antibodies were no longer detectable). The disparities in seroprevalence
among special population samples indicate significantly higher burden in these groups, likely
resulting from higher representation of front-line essential workers, health care employees, and
households living in more crowded conditions. However, additional research is needed to better
understand the significant sources of disparities among these populations. While it is unclear
how long individuals will have detectable levels of antibodies after a past infection of COVID-19,
results do reflect the increasing trends of COVID-19 infections that occurred between late
Spring and Fall across the state of Wisconsin. Further investigation regarding symptom severity,
exposure and lingering side effects will provide additional insights into the long term impacts of
COVID-19 infection on immunity and health outcomes. The third WAVE of antibody testing in
this population is planned for late February and early March 2020.
Funding: The Wisconsin Department of Health Services and The Wisconsin Partnership
Program.
Research in context: This is one of a few local and global population-based studies generated
from a random statewide sample of adults and children to show that antibody prevalence follows
infections in the population. Our observation that one third of participants who tested antibody
positive at WAVE I did not retest positive at WAVE II suggests that antibodies are not always
long-lasting, and the implications for long-term immunity remain unknown. It is also important to
point out that some changes could be due to specificity of the test itself. At 99.6% specificity, we
would expect a portion of the tests in both rounds are due to false positives, but it is hard to
ascertain how this is truly impacting study results [13, 14]. Nonetheless, these data provide
essential information for public health officials to work with communities to discuss the spread

past infections on health and well-being can be monitored as part of the ongoing Survey of the
Health of Wisconsin research program.
