ABSTRACT

25

There is an urgent need for evidence-based development and implementation of

26

engineering controls to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of

27

COVID-19. Ultraviolet (UV) light can inactivate coronaviruses, but the practicality of UV

28

light as an engineering control in public spaces is limited by the hazardous nature of

29

conventional UV lamps, which are Mercury (Hg)-based and emit a peak wavelength

30

(254 nm) that penetrates human skin and is carcinogenic. Recent advances in the

31

development and production of Krypton Chlorine (KrCl) excimer lamps hold promise in

32

this regard, as these emit a shorter peak wavelength (222 nm) and are recently being

33

produced to filter out emission above 240 nm. However, the disinfection kinetics of KrCl

34

UV excimer lamps against SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Here we provide the first dose

35

response report for SARS-CoV-2 exposed to a commercial filtered KrCl excimer light

36

source emitting primarily 222 nm UV light (UV222), using multiple assays of SARS-CoV-

37

2 viability. Plaque infectivity assays demonstrate the pseudo-first order rate constant of

38

SARS-CoV-2 reduction of infectivity to host cells to be 0.64 cm2/mJ (R2 = 0.95), which

39

equates to a D90 (dose for 1 log10 or 90% inactivation) of 1.6 mJ/cm2. Through RT-

40

qPCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene with a short (<100 bp) and long

41

(~1000 bp) amplicon in samples immediately after UV222 exposure, the reduction of

42

ability to amplify indicated an approximately 10% contribution of N gene damage to

43

disinfection kinetics. Through ELISA assay targeting the N protein in samples

44

immediately after UV222 exposure, we found no dose response of the ability to damage

45

the N protein. In both qPCR assays and the ELISA assay of viral outgrowth

46

supernatants collected 3 days after incubation of untreated and UV 222 treated SARS-

47

CoV-2, molecular damage rate constants were similar, but lower than disinfection rate

48

constants. These data provide quantitative evidence for UV222 doses required to

49

disinfect SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous solution that can be used to develop further

50

understanding of disinfection in air, and to inform decisions about implementing UV 222

51

for preventing transmission of COVID19.

INTRODUCTION

58

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent

59

of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a recently emerged infectious disease with

60

no cure. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily from person to person when mucous

61

membranes (e.g., lungs, eyes) are exposed to airborne viruses that have been emitted

62

by infected individuals in particles of various size1,2. Infection leads to a variable

63

disease course affecting multiple organ systems (respiratory, cardiac, neurological and

64

gastrointestinal); for this reason, the symptoms of COVID19 are variable and include

65

asymptomatic infection, fever, cough, dyspnea, malaise, nausea, ageusia/anosmia,

66

delirium and death. A number of antiviral and host-directed therapies have been or are

67

being explored as COVID19 treatments, including low-dose radiation3, nucleoside

68

analogs (e.g. remdesivir4, favipiravir5), hydroxychloroquine6, interferon beta7,

69

convalescent plasma8,9, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies10,11, and anti-inflammatories

70

such as dexamethasone12, IL6 inhibitors13, and JAK/STAT inhibitors14. Prophylactic

71

vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein have also recently become available15.

72

These treatments and vaccines are causes for optimism during the current COVID19

73

pandemic, which to date has killed nearly 2 million individuals; however, even after

74

vaccines become widely available, social distancing, face masks and other engineering

75

solutions that limit transmission will continue to be needed in the foreseeable future for

76

this and other emerging infectious diseases16.

77
78

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is an effective means of inactivating a number of respiratory

79

viruses, including human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43, a cause of the common

80

cold17) and SARS-CoV (etiological agent of the 2002 SARS epidemic18–20). UV is

81

commonly applied for upper room air disinfection, in HVAC systems, and in free-

82

standing air and surface purifiers. The feasibility of using UV on a widespread and

83

evidence-based level to minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2, however, is currently

84

limited by two reasons: (1) conventional mercury-based low pressure UV lamps are

85

impractical in many settings as they are hazardous to human health (the 254 nm

86

wavelength emission causes skin cancer21 and cataracts22) and the environment

87

(mercury from breaking fragile quartz lamp bulbs is toxic23), (2) the UV dose response

88

kinetics needed to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 are unknown. Should these two challenges

89

be overcome, the use of UV to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in environments with high

90

potential for transmission (e.g. congregate care facilities, convalescent patient homes,

91

hospital waiting rooms, airplane cabins) would be a practical and readily deployed

92

engineering solution to augment current prophylactic measures (social distancing, face

93

masks, vaccines). Due to a surge in interest and application of UV in various public

94

settings, there is an urgent need to understand the dose response kinetics of SARS-

95

CoV-2 to UV radiation to inform decisions which balance the risk to eyes and skin from

96

UV exposure with the risk of infection from virus transmission.

97
98

Here we demonstrate the dose response kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in liquid after

99

exposure to primarily 222 nm UV light emitted by a krypton-chlorine (KrCl) excimer lamp

100

(excilamp) filtered to reduce transmission of more harmful wavelengths > 240 nm. The

101

lower wavelength emission (222 nm) is neither carcinogenic in human skin models or

102

rodents24, nor causes acute corneal damage in rodents25. Additionally, the 222 nm

103

wavelength emitted by KrCl excilamps is inherently more effective at disinfection26,

104

nucleic acid damage27, and protein damage28,29 than 254 nm emitted by low pressure

105

mercury lamps due to greater absorbance of target biomolecules at lower wavelengths.

106

Krypton and chlorine in KrCl excilamps are much less toxic than mercury, and KrCl

107

excilamps have already been shown to be competitive in terms of electrical efficiency

108

with mercury lamps that have many more years of product development and

109

optimization30. Our results demonstrate that when an aqueous solution of pathogenic

110

SARS-CoV-2 is exposed to UV222 light emitted by a Kr-Cl excilamp, its infectivity and

111

integrity is attenuated in a UV dose-dependent manner, as measured by culture and

112

molecular assays. These first UV222 disinfection dose responses demonstrate the

113

feasibility of UV as an approach to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS

115

SARS-CoV-2 culture

116

SARS-CoV-2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, was obtained from Biodefense and Emerging

117

Infections Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources, Batch # 70034262) and

118

stored and cultured in the Ohio State University Biosafety Level 3 laboratory (IBC

119

Protocol # 2020R00000046). The viral stock used in this study was established by

120

thawing the Batch, diluting it 1:10,000 into incomplete DMEM (Gibco Cat# 11995-065,

121

supplemented with 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate), and adding it to

122

T175 flasks of confluent Vero cells (ATCC clone E6) for a one hour incubation period

123

(37°C, 5% CO2), after which the supernatant was removed and replaced with complete

124

DMEM (cDMEM; DMEM as above plus 4% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum). These

125

T175 flasks were incubated for 3 days (37°C, 5% CO2) to propagate infectious virus. At

126

the end of this period, visual inspection of the flasks under a light microscope

127

demonstrated that the nearly all Vero cells were dead. The supernatants in each of the

128

T175 flasks were presumed to contain infectious virus at this point, were carefully

129

transferred and combined into a 50mL conical, centrifuged at low speed to remove cell

130

debris, aliquoted into microcentrifuge tubes, frozen and stored at -80°C. The live virus

131

titer in frozen aliquots was determined to be ~107 plaque forming unit (PFU) per mL

132

using a modified version of plaque assay developed by the Diamond laboratory31 and

133

described below.

134

UV Dose Calculations

135

The UV222 light source (USHIO Care222®) is a KrCl excilamp that is optically filtered to

136

reduce emission > 240 nm. The UV source was turned on to warm up for 15 minutes

137

before any irradiance or spectral measurements or irradiations. Standardized

138

procedures were followed for carrying out quasi-collimated beam disinfection studies32

139

and calculating polychromatic UV doses33. The emission spectrum of the UV222 source

140

was measured using a NIST-traceable calibrated Ocean Optics HDX UV-Vis

141

spectroradiometer with an extreme solarization resistant 455 µ fiber and Spectralon

142

diffusing cosine corrector detector. Raw spectral data from the OceanView software

143

was interpolated to integer wavelengths using the FORECAST function in Microsoft

144

Excel and relativized to peak emission at 222 nm for use in dose calculations (Figures 1

145

and S1). Total incident UV-C irradiance was measured using an International Light

146

Technologies (ILT) 2400 radiometer with a SED 220/U solar blind detector, W Quartz

147

wide eye diffuser for cosine correction, and peak irradiance response NIST-traceable

148

calibration. For irradiance measurement, the peak wavelength calibration value was

149

input manually as the radiometer factor. The incident irradiance was measured with the

150

detection plane of the radiometer centered at the height and location of the sample

151

surface during UV exposures, and corrected for several factors to determine the

152

average irradiance through the sample depth. Spatial nonuniformity of emission was

153

accounted for each test by measuring irradiance at 0.5 cm increments from the center

154

to the edge of the petri dish and relativized to determine a petri factor, which was

155

always > 0.9. The typical detector spectral response was obtained from ILT and used to

156

calculate the radiometer factor integrated over the lamp emission, which was 0.9971.

157

As previously34, the reflection factor for water at the 222 nm peak wavelength was

158

assumed to be 0.9726. The divergence factor was determined each experiment day by

159

accounting for the distance between the lamp and the sample surface, and the sample

160

depth and was always > 0.9. The water factor was determined each sample day by the

161

ratio between the incident irradiance and the average irradiance integrated through the

162

sample depth after wavelength-specific absorption. The UV-vis absorbance of virus

163

working stocks (prepared fresh for each test) was measured in the biosafety cabinet

164

using a NanodropTM OneC spectrophotometer via the microvolume pedestal for

165

wavelengths 200 - 295 nm and the 1 cm quartz cuvette for wavelengths above 195 nm.

166

Working stock absorbance spectra for each test are shown in Figures 1 and S1. After

167

these adjustments to incident irradiance in the center of the sample, the average

168

irradiance was used to calculate exposure times (max: 15 minutes; min: 15 seconds) for

169

pre-determined UV doses (0-40 mJ/cm2) (summarized in Supplementary Table S1).

All UV measurements, sample preparation, UV treatments, and subsequent handling of

180

treated samples were performed in a biosafety cabinet. On the day of each three

181

biologically independent tests while the UV source warmed up and measurements were

182

taken for dose calculations, aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 (previously tittered at 107 PFU/mL)

183

were diluted in cDMEM to make a “working stock solution” with a target titer of 105

184

PFU/mL. For each UV dose tested, 3 mL of the working stock solution was pipetted into

185

a 3.7 cm2 area and 3.5 cm diameter polystyrene tissue culture dish (VWR Catalog #

186

82050-538) with a sterile Teflon-coated micro stir bar (VWR Catalog # 58948-353) and

187

positioned under the UV light on a small stir plate to achieve quiescent mixing while

188

blocking the UV light with a shutter. After removing the tissue culture dish lid, the

189

shutter was removed to expose the sample to UV light for the calculated exposure time

190

corresponding to the pre-determined UV dose before replacing the aperture to end the

191

UV exposure. Immediately afterwards, the treated media was transferred to a sterile 15

192

mL polypropylene centrifuge tube (VWR) and used for the assays described below.

193

Working stocks for untreated samples were placed on the stir plate for a representative

194

amount of time with the lamp off before transfer to centrifuge tube (0 mJ/cm 2).

195

SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay

196

Plaque assays were used to determine PFU/mL of samples before UV treatment (0

197

mJ/cm2) and after UV treatment (all other UV doses). The plaque assay used for this

198

study is a modification of that which was originally developed and reported by Case et

199

al,31 and is listed here as STEPS 1-5. (STEP 1) At least 18 hours prior to the assay, 12-

200

well plates were seeded with a sufficient number of Vero cells so that each well was

201

confluent by the assay start; plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. (STEP 2) On the

202

day of the assay, serial dilutions of virus-containing media (e.g UV treated virus

203

samples) were prepared in cDMEM (1:101, 1:102, 1:103, 1:104) and warmed to 37°C.

204

(STEP 3) Media from each well of the 12-well plate was gently removed via pipette and

205

replaced with 500uL of each virus serial dilution, the volume pipetted down the side of

206

the well so as not to disturb the Vero cell monolayer. (STEP 4) The plate was incubated

207

for one hour at 37°C, 5% CO2. (STEP 5) During that infection incubation period, a

208

solution comprising a 1:0.7 mixture of cDMEM and 2% methylcellulose (viscosity: 4000

209

cP) was freshly made and warmed to 37°C in a water bath. After the one hour infection

210

incubation period, the supernatant was removed from each well and replaced with 1 mL

211

of the warmed cDMEM/methylcellulose mixture. (STEP 6) The culture plate was then

212

returned to the incubator and left undisturbed for 3 days. On the final day,

213

cDMEM/methylcellulose mixture was removed from each well, cells were fixed with 4%

214

para-formaldehyde in PBS (20 minutes, room temperature), washed with PBS and

215

stained with 0.05% crystal violet (in 20% methanol). After rinsing plates with distilled

216

water, plates were dried and plaques were counted under a light microscope at 20X

217

magnification.

218

SARS-CoV-2 outgrowth assay

219

The virus outgrowth assay used for this study is identical to the plaque assay described

220

above, with the exception that after STEP 4 the virus laden media was replaced with 1

221

mL of warm cDMEM (instead of a cDMEM/methylcellulose mixture). Afterwards, the

222

culture plate was returned to the incubator and left undisturbed for 3 days. On the final

223

day, the cell supernatants of each well were collected, transferred into a microcentrifuge

224

tube, centrifuged at low speed to remove cell debris (1,000 x g, 10 min), aliquoted into

225

microcentrifuge tubes, frozen and stored at -80°C. Aliquots were subsequently used for

226

quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) measurement of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N)

227

gene copies, as well as ELISA determination of SARS-CoV-2 N protein concentrations.

228

SARS-CoV-2 N gene quantitation - N1 primer set

229

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 N gene directly in RNA

230

extracts of samples before UV treatment (0 mJ/cm2) and after UV treatment (all other

231

UV doses), and in RNA extracts of cell supernatant aliquots from outgrowth assays.

232

RNA was extracted from samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA method (Qiagen), and

233

converted to cDNA using the SuperScript IV first strand synthesis method with random

234

hexamer primers (Invitrogen). cDNA was subsequently amplified with the “N1 primer

235

set” and associated PCR conditions that were originally developed by the Centers for

236

Disease Control35. These primers are specific to nucleotides 13-85 of the N gene (NCBI

243

ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ1-3’; final concentration 125 nM). q-PCR

244

assays were run on a BioRad CFX Connect Real Time PCR system to determine CT

245

values from samples and standards. A standard curve was generated for the N1 primer

246

set by running serial dilutions on each plate of in vitro transcribed RNA converted to

247

cDNA relating N gene copy numbers to CT values. To generate this standard, RNA was

248

extracted from an aliquot of our SARS-CoV-2 stock and converted to cDNA before

249

amplification of the N gene using the N1 primer set as described above. The amplicon

250

was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, gel extracted and cloned/ligated into the

251

plasmid vector pCR II-TOPO (Invitrogen), downstream of the T7 promoter. Ligation

252

products were transformed into E. coli, and mini-preps of randomly selected colonies

253

were screened via PCR for the presence of insert. A single clone was then used to

254

produce in vitro transcribed (IVT) N gene RNA—a reagent necessary for accurate gene

255

copy number measurement—using the HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis

256

method (New England Biolabs). After treating the IVT RNA with DNase and performing

257

a cleanup reaction, the RNA concentration was determined via Nanodrop. The copies of

258

single stranded N gene RNA transcripts per µL was determined by the following

259

equation: [ RNA concentration (Nanodrop measurement, ng/µL) x the Avogadro number

260

(6.02 x 1023) ] / [Predicted molecular weight of transcript (23 kDa) x 109]. Serial dilutions

261

of IVT RNA were made (range: 1013→10-1 copies/L), converted to cDNA as above and

262

used as standards in the N gene copy number assay described above.

263

SARS-CoV-2 N gene quantitation - N1-2 primer set

264

qPCR was used to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 N gene in RNA extracts of samples of

265

working stocks before UV treatment (0 mJ/cm2) and immediately after UV treatment (all

266

other UV doses). RNA was extracted from samples and converted to cDNA as

267

described above. cDNA was subsequently quantified using a combination of the CDC

268

2019 N1 and N2 primer sets to generate a long (944 nt) amplicon: 2019-nCoV_N1-F

269

(forward) primer, 5’-GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT-3’; 2019-nCoV_N2-R (reverse)

270

primer, 5’-GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA-3’. Primers were obtained from IDT and final

271

RESULTS

300

SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity Response to UV222

301

Viral infectivity UV222 dose response was characterized by exponential decay kinetics

302

(Figure 2). At a mean initial viral titer of 6.51x104 PFU/mL, the pseudo first order rate

303

constant for viral disinfection was -1.48 cm2/mJ (R2 = 0.89). When expressed as LR of

304

viral infectivity after exposure to a given UV dose, the linear rate constant was 0.64

305

cm2/mJ (R2 = 0.95), which equates to a D90 (dose for 1 log10 or 90% inactivation) = 1.6

306

mJ/cm2. Doses ranges and initial Vero cell confluence were only sufficient in the Test 3

307

experimental replicate to quantify a dose response. However, in Test 2, the mean initial

308

viral titer of 3.54x104 PFU/mL in untreated samples was reduced to below detection by

309

the first dose tested of 10 mJ/cm2, equivalent to a LR of at least 4.25 logs. These

310

results were also consistent with qualitative results from Test 1, where Vero cells

311

appeared mostly dead in the untreated samples, appeared increasingly healthy through

312

doses 0.7 and 1.4 mJ/cm2, and appeared healthy at doses above 2 mJ/cm2.

SARS-CoV-2 N Gene and Protein Response to UV222

For the short amplicon spanning the N1 region of the N gene (CDC 2019), viral RNA

328

damage in response to UV222 immediately after treatment was also characterized by

329

exponential decay kinetics (Figure 3A). When expressed as LR of N1 copies/µL in

330

qPCR reactions after exposure to a given UV dose, the linear rate constant was 0.069 +

331

0.005 cm2/mJ (slope + standard error, R2 = 0.92). The N1 dose response was modeled

332

using the linear region between 0 - 20 mJ/cm2 to avoid tailing in the dose response.

333

When including only doses up to 10mJ/cm2 as for the plaque assay, the slope and R2 of

334

the N1 gene damage dose response was the same as for doses up to 20 mJ/cm2.

335

Compared with the LR rate constant for of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity measured by plaque

336

assay, the LR rate constant of N gene damage measured by N1 qPCR was

337

approximately 10-fold lower. Across all tests, the positive signal for SARS-CoV-2 in the

338

N1 assay was 10.75 + 0.25 log10 copies/L in cell cultures infected with untreated virus

339

(0 mJ/cm2), 4.89 + 0.86 log10 copies/L in uninfected cell culture supernatants, 5.49

340

log10 copies/L in RNA extraction negative control, 3.36 + 0.24 log10 copies/L in no

341

template RT-qPCR reaction controls (concentration data and standard curves shown in

342

Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). Despite this background signal, dose responses

343

were still discernable. For the N1 dose response after 3 days in the outgrowth assay for

344

doses up to 0 - 20 mJ/cm2, the linear rate constant was 0.260 + 0.036 cm2/mJ (slope +

345

standard error, R2 = 0.76). Although a positive dose response was apparent and the

346

slope was closer to the plaque assay (indicating better ability to predict plaque assay

347

dose response with combined cell culture with qPCR), the increased variability

348

introduced by cell culture decreased the strength of the regression.

349
350

For the long amplicon spanning both the N1 and N2 regions of N gene (CDC 2019),

351

viral RNA damage in response to UV222 immediately after treatment was also

352

characterized by exponential decay (Figure 3B). The linear rate constant for LR versus

353

UV222 dose was 0.054 + 0.003 cm2/mJ (slope + standard error, R2 = 0.94). Compared

354

with the LR rate constant for of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity measured by plaque assay, the

355

LR rate constant of N gene damage measured by N1-2 qPCR was approximately 10-

356

fold lower. This similarity indicates that increasing the amplicon length did not increase

357

the ability to detect gene damage that correlates with loss of viral infectivity. Across all

358

tests, the positive signal for SARS-CoV-2 in the N1-2 assay was 4.6 + 0.1 log10

359

copies/L in cell cultures infected with untreated virus, undetected in uninfected cell

361

(concentration data and standard curves shown in Supplementary Figures S2 and S3).

362

Because the long amplicon assay was used to investigate potential for improved

363

measurement of disinfection dose response without culture, no Day 3 samples were

364

analyzed.

365
366

Although no dose response was observed for LR of the N protein versus UV222 dose

367

immediately after treatment for doses up to 40 mJ/cm2 (0.002 + 0.001 cm2/mJ, slope +

368

standard error, R2 = 0.21), a stronger dose response was observed in Day 3 cell culture

369

supernatants for doses up to 20 mJ/cm2 (0.243 + 0.028 cm2/mJ, slope + standard error,

370

R2 = 0.21) (Figure 3C). Across all tests, the positive signal for SARS-CoV-2 in the N

371

protein assay was 2.69x105 + 9.83x104 pg/mL in untreated virus samples on Day 0,

372

1.41x108 + 2.99x108 in Day 3 cell culture supernatants infected with untreated virus,

373

and below detection in uninfected cell culture supernatants (concentration data and

DISCUSSION

397

This study provides the first rigorous UV222 dose response kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 in

398

aqueous solution, but there are limitations that must be acknowledged. Most

399

importantly, this study was conducted using virions suspended in aqueous solution.

400

This is only a starting point for quantifying dose response kinetics for airborne virus

401

disinfection that is most relevant for this virus, where many factors such as temperature,

402

humidity, air flow dynamics, and UV reactor specifics will impact dose responses.

403

Previous studies comparing disinfection kinetics of infectious agents in air at increasing

404

relative humidity to those in water36–41 indicate that these water dose responses may

405

present a conservative estimate of airborne disinfection kinetics because humidity in

406

many indoor environments is conditioned to reduce infectious agent persistence

407
408

One additional limitation of this study related to UV222 application in indoor environments

409

is that the disinfection impact of any ozone production by vacuum UV wavelengths

410

potentially emitted by the KrCl excilamp was not measured, but can likely be neglected

411

due to high airflows in the biosafety cabinet and BSL3 facility. The negative air quality

412

impacts and building material degradation by ozone potentially generated by these

413

lamps, and the potential health hazards and building material solarization from

414

wavelengths below 240 nm and the nonzero emission at wavelengths above 240 nm

415

(Supplementary Figure S1), should also be considered when weighing the benefits of

416

reducing infectious disease transmission by UV222 for COVID-19 and other infectious

417

diseases.

418
419

Considering these limitations, these data provide a strong foundation for future

420

development and application of UV222 for reducing airborne viral transmission. UV222 is

421

both 4.2 times safer for human exposure (the threshold limit values for human UV

422

exposure are 25 mJ/cm2 and 6 mJ/cm2 at 222 and 254 nm, respectively41) and at least

423

1.3 times as effective at disinfecting SARS-CoV-2 (the D90 we observed for UV222 (1.6

424

mJ/cm2) is lower than recently predicted by genomic modeling for UV254 (2.15

425

mJ/cm2)42). A recent study applying continuous UV222 at doses below these threshold

426

limit values to treat other airborne coronaviruses demonstrated multiple logs of

427

inactivation within minutes43. This low wavelength advantage for SARS-CoV-2

428

disinfection is consistent with a study where UV222 was more than twice as effective as

429

UV254 against MS2 bacteriophage34 and with other viral action spectra indicating greater

430

sensitivity at 222 nm than 254 nm26. A recent review44 predicted the median D90 for

431

coronavirus disinfection by UV254 to be 3.7 mJ/cm2. Our results and these predictions

432

are in general agreement with recent UV222 and UV254 disinfection studies of SARS-

433

CoV-2 as recently reviewed41. However, some of these studies are still in the process

434

of peer review and/or did not use standardized UV disinfection procedures that allow

435

comparisons between experiments and precise quantification of doses. In the only

436

UV222 SARS-CoV-2 surface decontamination study to date 45, researchers report 0.94

437

LR after 10 second exposure to 0.1 mW/cm2. Although UV dose cannot be calculated

438

for this study in the absence of sample absorbance and differences in experimental

439

setup, these results demonstrate a high degree of susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to

440

UV222 and generally align with ours.

441
442

Considering our data in context of literature, UV222 is a promising disinfection method for

443

SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous solution. These infectivity and molecular dose response data

444

could immediately inform measures to prevent transmission by water or wastewater

445

where infectious SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses have been shown to be potentially

446

persistent for days46,47. Although tailing was observed in dose responses for molecular

447

assays and may have been contributed from clumping of virus in the protein-laden

448

growth media, viruses were disinfected below detection in plaque assays, indicating that

449

aggregation did not interfere with complete viral inactivation. We did not observe a

450

strong relationship between the kinetics of N gene damage (measured by qPCR with a

451

short and long amplicon) and disinfection, which could reflect that protein damage

452

contributes more to disinfection than genome damage for SARS-CoV-2. One study of

453

MS2 bacteriophage found RNA genome damage to be closely related to and thus

454

contributed to disinfection kinetics27, whereas a study of Adenovirus found DNA genome

455

damage not to be closely related to disinfection48. This disparity between these viruses

456

with different structures and hosts was further demonstrated when it was shown that

457

protein damage, especially to external capsid proteins, contributes more strongly to UV

458

disinfection of Adenovirus49. However, we also did not see a strong association

459

between the kinetics of N protein damage and disinfection. Because we only measured

460

the N protein that closely associates with the viral genome, we may have missed

461

damage to external proteins such as the spike protein which are on the surface to

462

absorb incoming UV radiation and are vital in infection of host cells50. Additionally, the

463

confirmation and sequence of the genome and proteins can affect UV genetic

464

damage51–55, so the N protein and gene may not be the targets that primarily contribute

465

to disinfection-inducing molecular damage. These factors could explain the weak

466

relationships we observed between disinfection kinetics and N gene damage or N

467

protein damage, and warrant further investigation to unravel the mechanisms of

468

disinfection at this and other UV wavelengths. While these mechanistic complexities

469

remain to be resolved, the disinfection kinetics we report indicate the high degree of

470

susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in aqueous solution to UV222.

Figure S1: (A) The raw spectral emission from 200 - 300 nm of the filtered excilamp

711

(USHIO Care222®) was interpolated and relativized to the peak emission at 222 nm for

712

use in UV dose calculations and plotted on log scale to show orders of magnitude less

713

but non-zero emission at filtered wavelengths > 240 nm. (B) The absorbance spectrum

714

from 200 - 300 nm of SARS-CoV-2 at ~105 PFU/mL in cDMEM was measured for each

715
