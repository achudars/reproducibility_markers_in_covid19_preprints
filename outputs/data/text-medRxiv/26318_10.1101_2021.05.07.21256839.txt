Abstract (197 words)

50

Objectives: This study examined the association between perceived organizational

51

support (POS) and COVID-19 vaccine intention and the influence of the

52

implementation of workplace infection prevention measures.

53

Methods: We analyzed 23,846 workers using data from an Internet survey of workers

54

aged 20–65 years conducted in December 2020, during a period of widespread

55

COVID-19 infection in Japan.

56

Results: A higher POS was associated with a higher intention to vaccinate. The

57

relationship between POS and vaccine intention was attenuated when adjusted for

58

infection prevention measures in the workplace.

59

Conclusions: In workplaces where POS is present, a sense of responsibility to the

60

group and altruistic behavior may arise. This means employees act to acquire herd

61

immunity to protect others, which may result in increased vaccine intention. The

62

association between POS and vaccination intention was attenuated by adjusting for

63

workplace infection prevention measures, which suggested that infection prevention

64

measures may be a confounding factor or that POS created a health climate that

65

promoted infection prevention measures. The results suggest that working to improve

66

employee well-being and implementing appropriate workplace infection prevention

67

measures during infectious disease outbreaks may promote vaccination behavior and

68

contribute to the acquisition of herd immunity in the community.

Introduction

74

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of coronavirus

75

disease 2019 (COVID-19)1) was a pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory

76

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of April 1, 2021, 128,822,735 people

77

worldwide had been infected with COVID-19 and 2,815,166 people had died2).

78

Although the number of infected people in Japan was lower than that in Europe and the

79

United States, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency three times (as of

80

April 25, 2021)3). It is important to implement preventive actions against emerging

81

infectious diseases, and actions such as keeping a physical distance, wearing masks, and

82

hand disinfection were recommended to help combat COVID-194). In addition to these

83

infection prevention measures, acquisition of herd immunity is important to end the

84

pandemic5). However, given the few infected people at that time, a survey conducted in

85

December 2020 reported the antibody prevalence among Japanese people was 1.35% in

86

Tokyo, which was the city with the highest prevalence6).

87

The newly-developed COVID-19 vaccine is being administered in many

88

countries to achieve herd immunity. It is also important to achieve herd immunity

89

through vaccination in Japan to protect people from COVID-19 and restore economic

90

activities. In Japan, vaccination of approximately 40,000 healthcare workers began on

91

February 17, 2021, and vaccination of older people (aged ≥65 years) began in April

92

20217). However, many people are hesitant to be vaccinated, and some even refuse

93

vaccination8). This vaccine hesitancy is considered a major barrier to the acquisition of

94

herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccines may cause adverse reactions, and there

95

are ethical issues involved in making vaccination mandatory. Therefore, in most

96

countries, vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary and based on individual decision

97

making9). The vaccination rate in Japan is lower than that in other countries, including

98

for the seasonal influenza vaccine10), influenza A (H1N1) that occurred in 200911), and

99

the human papilloma virus vaccine (which appeared to be associated with side effects

100

although the causal relationship was unclear)12). Addressing vaccine hesitancy in Japan

101

is therefore important to achieve herd immunity to COVID-19.

102

Organizational factors such as leadership in health promotion and the health

103

climate have a significant impact on employees’ health behaviors13). With regard to

104

vaccination, in workplaces with a good health climate that supports employees’ health

105

promotion and when infection prevention measures are actively implemented, the

106

number of people in that workplace who are vaccinated may increase. Previous

107

literature on organizational factors in the workplace and vaccination behavior reported

108

that the presence of organizational governance influenced vaccination rates in

109

healthcare organizations14).

110

An indicator related to such a health climate is perceived organizational

111

support (POS). POS is based on social exchange theory and refers to an employee’s own

112

perception of whether their organization is supportive of improving the well-being of its

113

employees. A previous study found that employees with a high POS were more likely to

114

participate in wellness programs compared with those with a low POS15). Therefore,

115

employees working in organizations with high POS may be more willing to be

116

vaccinated to help prevent infection in the workplace. Furthermore, during the

117

COVID-19 pandemic, employers are expected to be proactive in adopting infection

118

prevention measures in collaboration with their employees. This suggests that proactive

119

infection prevention measures that seek to protect the health of employees may increase

120

POS. However, no previous studies have examined the relationship between POS in the

121

workplace during a

122

pandemic outbreak or the status of infection control efforts in the workplace and

123

vaccine intentions.

124

We therefore formulated two hypotheses: 1) “Employees with a high POS have

125

a high intention to be vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine” and 2) “The association

126

between POS and vaccine intention is influenced by the implementation status of

127

infection prevention measures in the workplace.” We examined these hypotheses using

128

data from an Internet survey conducted in Japan when COVID-19 vaccination was in

129

the planning stage.

Materials and Methods

147

A research group from the University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan,

148

conducted a prospective cohort study, known as the Collaborative Online Research on

149

Novel-coronavirus and Work study (CORoNaWork study). The self-administered

150

questionnaire survey was completed by a panel registered with the Internet survey

151

company Cross Marketing Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). During the baseline survey (conducted

152

December 22–25, 2020), Japan was in the third wave of the pandemic in which the

153

numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths were markedly higher than in the first and

154

second waves; therefore, the country was on high alert.

155

We used baseline survey data from the CORoNaWork study to conduct the

156

present cross-sectional study. The CORoNaWork study protocol, including the sampling

157

plan and participant recruitment procedure, has previously been reported in detail16).

158

Participants were aged 20–65 years and working at the time of the baseline survey (N =

159

33,087), and stratified using cluster sampling by gender, age, region, and occupation.

160

After excluding 6,051 participants who provided invalid responses, we included data for

161

27,036 participants from the database. The exclusion criteria for the present study were:

162

individuals who had been infected with the COVID-19 or who had been a close contact

163

of a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19; self-employed workers; workers in

164

small/home offices; and agriculture, forestry, and fishery workers. We finally analyzed

165

data for 23,846 workers.

166

The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of

167

Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan (reference No. R2-079). Informed

168

consent was obtained through the CORoNaWork study survey website at the time data

194

household income was classified into four categories: <2.50 million Japanese yen

195

(JPY); 2.50–3.74 million JPY; 3.75–4.99 million JPY; and ≥5.00 million JPY.

196

Education was classified into four categories: junior high school or high school,

197

vocational school, junior college or technical school, university, and graduate school.

198

Marital status was classified into three categories: married; divorced or bereaved; and

199

unmarried. In the baseline survey, participants chose one of 10 options for their

200

occupation: general employee; manager; executive manager; public employee, faculty

201

member

202

self-employed; small office/home office; agriculture, forestry, or fishing; professional

203

occupations (e.g., lawyer, tax accountant, medical-related); and other occupations. As

204

noted above, three of these categories were excluded from this study, meaning the

205

occupations were ultimately classified into seven categories. The number of employees

206

in the workplace was classified into four categories: 1–9, 10–99, 100–999, and ≥1000.

207

In addition, the cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 infection 1 month before the

208

survey was conducted in the prefectures of residence was used as a community-level

variable. This information was collected from the websites of public institutions.

Results

245

Table 1 shows participants’ characteristics by POS category. Of the 23,846 participants,

246

1,958 (8%) reported very high POS. In very high POS category 836 (43%) workers

247

wanted the COVID-19 vaccination, and in very low POS category 1,382 (36%) workers

248

wanted vaccination.

249

Table 2 shows the association between POS (continuous and categories) and

250

COVID-19 vaccine intention. In the analysis with POS as a continuous variable, POS

251

was associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention (Model 2: OR=1.11, 95% confidence

252

interval [CI]: 1.08–1.15, p<0.001). The OR decreased after additional adjustment for

253

number of workplace infection control measures (Model 3: OR=1.06, 95% CI:

254

1.02–1.09, p<0.001). In the analysis with POS as a categorical variable, very high POS

255

was associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention (reference: very low POS) (Model 2:

256

OR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.20–1.51, p<0.001). The OR decreased after additional adjustment

257

for number of workplace infection control measures (Model 3: OR=1.17, 95% CI:

258

1.04–1.31, p<0.001). In contrast, high POS was associated with COVID-19 vaccine

259

intention (Model 2: OR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.09–1.27, p<0.001), but was not associated

260

with vaccine intention after additional adjustment for number of workplace infection

261

control measures (Model 3: OR=1.05, 95% CI: 0.97–1.13, p=0.276).

Discussion

269

This study showed that higher the POS in the population, the higher the vaccine

270

intention. The relationship between POS and vaccine intention was attenuated when

271

adjusted for workplace infection prevention measures. POS is based on the social

272

exchange theory, which suggests that in workplaces with POS, there may be a sense of

273

responsibility toward the group and altruistic behavior toward organizational members,

274

meaning vaccine intentions for infection prevention may have increased20,21). Vaccine

275

intention also includes the social benefits of vaccination. The 5C (confidence,

276

complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility) scale has previously

277

been used as an indicator to evaluate the complex factors related to vaccine intention. In

278

the 5C scale, collective responsibility is positively correlated with both collectivist

279

tendencies and community orientation and is considered important because it

280

corresponds to the protection of others through herd immunity through one’s own

281

vaccination behavior22).

282

There are two possible reasons why the association between POS and vaccine

283

intention was attenuated by adjusting for workplace infection prevention measures. First,

284

if workplace infection prevention measures are a confounding factor, proactive infection

285

prevention measures during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to increase

286

employees’ POS. Although POS does not increase with measures based on laws and

287

regulations or mandatory measures, it is highly valued by organizational members when

288

measures are based on discretionary choices of the organization23). In addition,
12

289

proactive infection prevention measures may have increased employee health literacy

290

and weakened their concern about vaccines. Conversely, even after adjusting for

291

infection prevention measures, POS was associated with vaccination intention,

292

suggesting that POS itself may have a direct effect on vaccine intention. Second, POS

293

during the COVID-19 pandemic may have facilitated the implementation of workplace

294

infection prevention measures. The presence of leadership support in workplace health

295

promotion has been reported to increase POS15), and high POS in the workplace may

296

increase employee participation in health behaviors24). The same is likely to be true for

297

workplace infection prevention measures that are implemented with a collaborative

298

understanding between employees and the company. As a result, implementation of

299

various workplace infection prevention measures may have increased understanding of

300

vaccines and fostered a “norm of preventing infection” in the workplace, which may

301

have been associated with vaccination intention.

302

Vaccine intention is based on the relative perception of the efficacy of

303

vaccination and the risk for adverse reactions. As of December 2020, when the survey

304

for this study was conducted, international information regarding vaccine trials and

305

vaccination was still in being received, and it is unlikely that the public had sufficient

306

accurate information on the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, it is possible that correct

307

knowledge about the seriousness of infectious diseases gained in the process of

308

implementing workplace infection prevention measures may have raised awareness

309

regarding the need for vaccination. It has also been noted that vaccination behavior is

310

susceptible to social norms, and this may have influenced the intention to vaccinate25-28).

311

POS is rooted in the mutual relationship between the organization and its employees.

312

The present results suggested that a good mutual relationship between the two on a
13

313

regular basis may lead to an appropriate response to protect the health and life of the

314

organization and its employees in the event of a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

315

In addition, high POS has been associated with employees’ work-related indicators,

316

such as high organizational commitment, job performance, and lower turnover

317

attitudes23). Conversely, it has been suggested that an organization taking proactive

318

actions to ensure the health and life of its employees during a crisis may have a positive

319

impact on subsequent employee performance.

320

This study had several limitations that warrant mention. First, the generalizability of

321

the results is uncertain because this study was conducted through an Internet panel.

322

However, we attempted to reduce bias in the target population as much as possible by

323

sampling according to region, job type, and prefecture based on the infection incidence

324

rate. Second, the timing of the survey might have affected the responses of the target

325

population. Since the survey was conducted when Japan was experiencing a full-scale

326

spread of infection, vaccine intention and the status of implementation of workplace

327

infection prevention measures may have been affected. In addition, the vaccination plan

328

in Japan was undecided and it was unclear when the vaccination would be available,

329

which may have influenced vaccine intention responses. Third, POS was evaluated with

330

a simple question (“Your company supports employees in finding a balance between

331

active, productive working and healthy living” (Strongly agree/Agree/Disagree/Strongly

332

disagree), and the measurement validity of the original concept of POS was untested.

333

This study suggests that high POS during the COVID-19 pandemic increases

334

employees’ vaccination intention. In addition, the relationship between POS and

335

vaccination intention is strongly influenced by implementation of workplace infection

336

prevention measures. Therefore, promoting the improvement of employees’ well-being

and implementing appropriate workplace infection prevention measures in the event of

338

an emerging infectious disease outbreak may influence the vaccination behavior of

339

employees. In turn, this may contribute to the acquisition of herd immunity in the
