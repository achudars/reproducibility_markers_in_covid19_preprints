The objective of this research is to identify severity zones for the COVID-19 outbreak in
Malaysia. The technique employed for the purpose is fuzzy graph that can accommodate
scarcity, quantity, and availability of data set. Two published sets of data by the Ministry of
Health of Malaysia are used to implement the technique. The obtained results can offer
descriptive insight, reflection, assessment, and strategizing actions in combating the pandemic.

The public panic and discomfort on the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remind us of the
history of the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, whereby over 50 million people died worldwide. It
was a deadly pandemic, indeed. The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has claimed 259 593 lives worldwide as of 8th May 2020, 08:00 GMT, according to the
World Health Organization (WHO). Since the first case of pneumonia of unknown cause
detected in Wuhan reported to the WHO Country Office in China on 31st December 2019 and
followed by its declaration as a Public Health Emergency by the international body on 30 th
January 2020, researchers, scientists, and mathematicians have been racing in their efforts to
stop the potential devastating assault by the coronavirus.

Zhou et al. [1] first tipped off the world to the menace of the virus through their publication
in Nature. However, the researchers did not employ any specific mathematical tools in their
work. Most mathematical modelers have employed Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE),
such as Liang [2] as a tool in their predictive modeling of COVID-19. Similarly, Qianying et
al. [3] adopted the system of ordinary differential equations that previously used to model the
pandemic 1918 Spanish Flu for describing the current COVID-19 outbreak. Recently, Krantz
and Rao [4] described underreporting cases of COVID-19 for several countries using coupled
ODE-wavelets

Generally, a graph represents a relationship between objects. Objects are represented as
vertices and the relations by edges. A graph is formally defined as the following.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is only a publication that used graph for
COVID-19 related issues currently. It is in Forster et al. [8] whereby the researchers analyzed
the coronavirus genomes using the phylogenetic network, a special type of graph that has been
used mainly in archeological studies.
There are three main downsides for modeling COVID-19, namely, scarcity, quantity, and
availability of data that are essential to produce a good reliable mathematical model. This is
due to the fact that the outbreak is about six months old since the first case was reported.
Therefore, a flexible and robust mathematical technique that can handle such identified
shortcomings is necessary to model the outbreak. In this paper, a fuzzy graph analysis method
is presented, namely fuzzy autocatalytic set, that is capable of accommodating such constraints
to analyze the current pandemic.

Definition 1 (see [9]). A graph is a pair of sets (𝑉, 𝐸) where 𝑉 is the set of vertices and 𝐸 is
the set of edges.
Furthermore, another way to represent a graph is by its adjacency matrix. The definition of an
adjacency matrix for a graph is given in Definition 2 below.
Definition 2 (see [9]). An adjacency matrix of graph 𝐺(𝑉, 𝐸) with 𝑛 vertices is an 𝑛 × 𝑛 matrix
denoted by 𝐴(𝑎𝑖𝑗 ), where 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 1 if 𝐸 contains a directed edge (𝑗, 𝑖). It is an arrow pointing
from vertex 𝑗 to vertex 𝑖, and 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 0 otherwise.

The concepts of graph and fuzzy set have given ‘birth’ to a new mathematical structure,
namely, fuzzy graph. Definition 3 indicates that vertices and edges are both fuzzy. In other
words, the vertices and edges have values between 0 and 1. Figure 0.2 illustrates a fuzzy graph.

Definition 3 (see [10]). A fuzzy graph 𝐺(𝜎, 𝜇) is a pair of function 𝜎: 𝑆 ⟶ [0,1] and
𝜇: 𝑆 × 𝑆 ⟶ [0,1] such that ∀𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝑆, 𝜇(𝑥, 𝑦) ≤ 𝜎(𝑥) ⋀ 𝜎(𝑦).
An adjacency matrix of a fuzzy graph is defined as follows:
Definition 4 (see [10]). An adjacency matrix, 𝐴 of a fuzzy graph 𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝜎, 𝜇) is an 𝑛 × 𝑛
matrix defined as 𝐴 = (𝑎𝑖𝑗 ) such that 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 𝜇(𝑣𝑗 , 𝑣𝑖 ).

The concept of autocatalysis was originated in chemistry, in particular, for the description of
catalytic interaction between molecules [11], [12]. Further, Jain and Krishna [13] formalized
the concept of an autocatalytic set (ACS) as a directed graph in which its vertices represent
species and edges represent catalytic interactions among them. The formal definition of an
ACS is given as follows.
Definition 5 (see [13]). An autocatalytic set is a subgraph, each of whose vertices has at least
one incoming link from vertices belonging to the same subgraph.
Some examples of ACSs are illustrated in Figure 0.3. The simplest ACS is a vertex with 1cycle.

Figure 0.3

Some examples of ACS

The merger of the fuzzy graph and autocatalytic set has led to the idea of the fuzzy autocatalytic
set (FACS) by Tahir et al. [14]. The concept of FACS COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia is
depicted in Figure 0.4. The formal definition of FACS is laid as follows.
Definition 6 (see [14]). A fuzzy autocatalytic set is a subgraph each of whose vertices has at
least one incoming link with membership value, 𝜇(𝑒𝑖 ) ∈ (0,1], ∀𝑒𝑖 ∈ 𝐸 from any other vertices
are belonging to the same subgraph.

The adjacency matrix in Figure 0.1(b) and Figure 0.2(b) is then processed by the procedure
outlined in [14], [15] and improved by [16], respectively. The outcomes of the process are
determined via the following steps.
Step 1:

Keeping 𝐶(𝑠 × 𝑠) matrix fixed, 𝑥 evolved according to the following equation.
𝑛

𝑥𝑖′

= ∑ 𝑐𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑗 − 𝑥𝑖 ∑ 𝑐𝑘𝑗 𝑥𝑗 ,

Step 2:

Step 3:

𝑗,𝑘=1

for time 𝑡, which is large enough for 𝑥 to get reasonably close to its attractor 𝑿
(Perron Frobenius Eigenvector). We denoted 𝑋𝑖 ≡ 𝑥𝑖 (𝑡).
The set 𝐿 of nodes 𝑖 with the least value of 𝑋𝑖 is determined, i.e.
𝐿 = {𝑖 ∈ 𝑆 | 𝑋𝑖 = min𝑗∈𝑆 𝑋𝑗 , 𝑆 = {1, 2, 3, … , 𝑠}}.
This is the set of “least fit” nodes, identifying the relative concentration of a variable
in the attractor (or, more specifically, at 𝑡) with its “fitness” in the environment
defined by the graph. The least fit node is removed from the system along with its
links, leading a graph of 𝑠 − 1 variables.
𝐶 is now reduced to (𝑠 − 1) × (𝑠 − 1) matrix. The remaining nodes and links of 𝐶
remained unchanged. All these 𝑥𝑖 (0 ≤ 𝑥𝑖 ≤ 1) are rescaled to keep
𝑛−1

125

∑ 𝑥𝑖 = 1.
𝑖=1

126
127
128
129

131

Repeat all the steps until the 2 × 2 matrix is attained.
Figure 0.5 illustrates the initial step (Step 1). Then one of the nodes with the least eigenvector
is removed from the graph (Step 2). The node is removed along with its links, and the graph is
left with a reduced number of nodes and links (Step 3). This process is then repeated until a
graph with at least two nodes is attained.

The procedure to transform the graph into 2D-Euclidean space is adopted from [17], which is
based on the Laplacian matrix and solving a unique one-dimensional optimization problem in
order to determine their coordinates. The general overview of the transformation is depicted in
Figure 0.6.

The proposed technique is implemented on two sets of data. The data are collected from the
Ministry of Health, Malaysia (moh.gov.my), and presented in the following subsections. The
data of new, death, and recovery cases in Malaysia from 10th March to 10th April 2020 is given
in Table 0.1. However, the breakdown of reported new cases between states in Malaysia from
28th March to 5th April is considered for the first case. The period is selected due to the
erraticness of the data, as depicted in Figure 0.7a.

Using FACS for sampled data 28th March to 5th April 2020, 16 states are identified and
clustered, namely, Cluster 1 contains Perlis, Kedah, Pulau Pinang and Perak. Cluster 2
includes Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka and Johor whereas Cluster 3 is made of Pahang,
Trengganu, Kelantan and Sabah. Finally, Sarawak, WP Kuala Lumpur, WP Labuan and WP
Putrajaya formed Cluster 4.
These clusters are then classified into three zones (refer to Figure 0.8); Zones 1, 2, and
3. Zone 1 is named as the Under Control zone that comprises of Perlis, Kedah, Pulau Pinang,
and Perak. These four states are scattered in Zone 1, which reflects their disparity with low
reported new cases.
Zone 2 in the Medium zone is consisting of Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, and Sabah.
Increased new cases reported in these states only happened after 31st March. Although Zone 2
is dominated by Cluster 3, it is not total domination since there were a couple of instances
where Cluster 2 and 4 popped up in the zone. Hence, the government has to pay attention to
the states in Cluster 3 because these states have the potential to move into Zone 3. On top of
that, Zone 2 is clearly closed adjacent to Zone 3.

In fact, the government has gazetted 23 districts in these states as the red zone, namely,
Putrajaya, Jasin, Negeri Sembilan, Hulu Langat, Petaling, Johor Bahru, Kuching, and Tawau.
The district of Hulu Selangor in the state of Selangor has announced another red zone on 10th
April (Figure 0.10a). Our FACS analysis concurred with the list of states in red zones released
by Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (CPRC), Ministry of Health of Malaysia.

In Figure 0.12, we observed two significant features. First, the majority of the nodes are linedup at 𝒚 = 𝟎 (see Figure 0.13a). This feature hints that all the states in Malaysia are responding
well with Malaysia’s mitigation strategy during the period. In other words, no states are left
behind. Second, there are two axes, namely 𝒙 = − 𝟎. 𝟒 and 𝒙 = 𝟎. 𝟒, that divide the plane (see

Hence, three zones are observed, namely Zone 1 (green), Zone 2 (yellow), and Zone 3 (blue).
Zone 1 is dominated by Node 1, Zone 2 by Nodes 2 and 4, and Zone 3 by Node 3. Zone 1 is
the most comfortable zone, Zone 2 is where most activities occur, and states in Zone 3 are
maintaining their efforts but not out of the wood yet.

One of the most significant results is the comparison with regard to the implementation of the
FACS technique on the two sets of data is the alignment of zones. In Figure 0.8, these nodes
occupied three quadrants of the plane that led to 3 identified zones with respect to data 28 th
March 2020 – 5th April 2020. On the other hand, these nodes occupied three sectors vertically
for data 6th April 2020 – 2nd May 2020 (see Figure 0.12). The alignment of zones clearly
indicates that the mitigation strategy taken by the Malaysian government has been fruitful and
on the right track.

In this paper, we demonstrated a fuzzy autocatalytic analysis for the COVID-19 outbreak in
Malaysia. The method is able to identify some significant features of the pandemic outbreak
as well as some essential assessments on mitigation strategies. The method can be used to
model any future pandemic.
