Abstract

22

Within five weeks in early 2021, B.1.1.7 became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage at an

23

outpatient testing site in Berlin. Characteristics including Ct-values of 193 and 125 recently ill

24

outpatients with B.1.1.7 and wildtype virus, respectively, were similar, except for more

25

commonly reported sore throat and travel, and less frequently stated loss of smell and taste in

26

the former.

27

The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage (variant of concern [VOC] 202012/01, or 20I/501Y.V1)

28

likely emerged during autumn 2020 in the United Kingdom and quickly became the dominant

29

strain (1). It carries multiple mutations and deletions, including 501Y and deletion

30

∆H69/∆V70 (del69–70) in the spike protein. The B.1.1.7 variant is considered to exhibit

31

increased transmissibility compared to non-VOC lineages (1), hereafter referred to as

32

wildtype virus, whereas increased fatality is ambiguous (2,3).

33

At the outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing site of Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the

34

first patient infected with the B.1.1.7 variant was identified on January 18, 2021. Herein, we

35

describe lineage prevalence over time as well as demographic and clinical characteristics in

36

outpatients with the B.1.1.7 variant and those with the wildtype virus presenting until end of

37

March. Ethical approval for the analysis was obtained from Charité’s institutional review

38

board (EA4/083/20).

39
40

The study

41

Details of the testing site have been described (4). Upon presentation, physicians interviewed

42

patients on demographics, medical history, and symptoms. If indicated, an combined oro-

43

nasopharyngeal swab was collected. SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed applying a cobas®

44

6800/8800 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), targeting both ORF1ab and E

45

Gene (5). All positive samples were typed for the N501Y and del69–70 polymorphisms by

46

melting curve analysis. Variants including both polymorphisms were considered B.1.1.7.

47

Between January 18 and March 29, 2021, 349 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients

48

presented. In this period, the proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant increased from 2% to >90%

49

(Figure 1). In total, 35.8% (125/349) of the samples belonged to the wildtype lineage, 57.0%

50

(199/349) were the B.1.1.7 variant, and 7.2% (25/349) other non-wildtype variants (non-

51

VOCs).

52

Six patients previously had received ≥1 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (five, first dose

53

AZD1222 [Oxford-AstraZeneca] 4-24 days before; one, second BNT162b2

54

[Pfizer/BioNTech] dose 66 days before); all were infected with B.1.1.7 and were excluded

55

from analysis as were patients carrying lineages other than wildtype or B.1.1.7. Half of the

56

patients were female (49%); mean age was 36±15 years. Almost all reported symptoms

57

(97%). Median symptom duration until testing was 3 days (IQR, 2, 4). Leading complaints

58

were fatigue (72%), headache (69%), and muscle ache (60%). Fifteen percent reported travel

59

outside of Berlin in the last fourteen days, and half (49%) had had contact with a confirmed

60

SARS-CoV-2 case (Table 1).

61

Most assessed characteristics did not substantially differ between patients carrying the

62

SARS-CoV-2 wildtype or the B.1.1.7 lineage, including age, sex, leading complaints,

63

symptom duration, contacts to a confirmed case, and time passed since such contacts (Table

64

1). However, B.1.1.7 patients had travelled more frequently than those infected with the

65

wildtype strain (19% vs. 10%). As for symptoms, patients with B.1.1.7 more often reported

66

sore throat than those with the wildtype lineage (54% vs. 42%) but less often loss of

67

smell/taste (24% vs. 38%) (Table 1).

68

We observed no difference in cycle threshold (Ct)-values for the E Gene target

69

between B.1.1.7 and wildtype samples (medians, 20.2 vs. 20.1) (Table 1). In patients reporting

70

a symptom duration of ≥7 days, Ct-values appeared to be lower for the B.1.1.7 lineage

71

(median, 26.2; wildtype, 30.1; Mann-Whitney-U-test, P=0.7) (Table 1, Figure 2).

72

Lastly, we explored which combination of variables in our dataset best predicted the

73

B.1.1.7 variant in a logistic regression applying a backward stepwise selection based on the

74

Akaike information criterion. This identified the best set of predictors as absent loss of

75

smell/taste (P=0.01), longer symptom duration (P=0.02), sore throat (P=0.05), lower Ct-

76

value (P=0.07), travel in the last 14 days (P=0.08), lower age (P=0.09), and absent

77

rhinorrhea (P=0.12). We then used bootstrap technique to repeat the variable selection in

78

1,000 replicated datasets and evaluated how often these variables were selected with the

79

backward selection. This resulted in loss of smell/taste, 89%; symptom duration, 78%; travel,

80

73%; sore throat, 68%; Ct-value, 66%; age, 56%; rhinorrhea, 51%. Absent loss of smell/taste,

81

longer symptom duration, and travel were selected most often, indicating their importance in

82

B.1.1.7 variant prediction. All analyses were done in R version 3.6.3.

83
84

Discussion

85

The first B.1.1.7 case in Germany was notified in late December 2020 (6). At our testing site,

86

the B.1.1.7 lineage was first observed three weeks later and replaced the wildtype virus as the

87

dominant strain within five weeks only. The rapid emergence and dominance of this lineage

88

likely results from its increased transmissibility (1), which is potentially caused by spike

89

protein polymorphisms including 501Y conferring enhanced mucosal binding (7); 681H, near

90

a region important for transmission (8); deletion 69-70, linked to immune escape (9). Viral

91

replication in vitro does not differ from pre-existing strains (10).

92

The B.1.1.7 variant reportedly is associated with increased mortality (2), although this

93

has been questioned (3). In our young outpatient study population, we did not observe major,

94

lineage-dependent differences in leading symptoms. Nevertheless, loss of smell/taste, among

95

the most specific COVID-19 symptoms (4), was less common in patients infected with

96

B.1.1.7., whereas, sore throat was more frequently reported than in wildtype virus patients.

97

Similarly, a UK survey revealed less loss of smell/taste in B.1.1.7 patients but more sore

98

throat, cough, fatigue, myalgia, and fever (11). In contrast, no associations between SARS-

99

CoV-2 B.1.1.7 and self-reported symptoms, disease duration, or hospital admissions were

100

seen in another UK study (12). The most important factors for B.1.1.7 infection prediction in

101

our study appeared to be loss of smell/taste and longer symptom duration, in addition to

102

recent travel.

103

As for Ct-values, one study observed similar figures in patients infected with B.1.1.7

104

and wildtype lineages; however, a longer duration of infection with the B.1.1.7 variant was

105

suggestive by repeated sampling over time (13). Likewise, longer persistence has been

106

observed for B.1.1.7 (14), but also lower Ct-values (higher viral load) compared to wildtype

107

samples. Lower Ct-values were also seen in other studies on population (15) and inpatient

108

levels (3). In our cross-sectional assessment of recently ill outpatients, we did not observe

109

such differences. Still, increased transmissibility may result from the variant’s prolonged

110

excretion (13,14). Test timing appears crucial for the interpretation of Ct-values. Outpatients

111

are commonly tested earlier in the course of infection than inpatients. The combination of

112

prolonged viral shedding with different test timing might explain increased viral load in

113

B.1.1.7 samples in inpatients, but not in recently ill outpatients. In support of that, in our

114

outpatients with ≥7 days symptom duration, Ct-values in B.1.1.7 samples were suggestively

115

reduced. However, the comparison groups were small. Our data enable to detect a maximum

116

effect size on overall Ct-values, which corresponds to B.1.1.7 Ct-values being 1.5 units below

117

wildtype, or 1.0 above.

118

The main limitation in our study are limited subgroup sizes, which reduced the

119

likelihood to detect differences between rare characteristics. Others are the one-time

120

assessment, subjective symptom duration, and the variable manifestation of SARS-CoV-2

121

infection (4). Strengths include standardized procedures conducted by trained medical staff

122

and the prospective nature of the study evaluating patient groups during the same time period,

123

reducing the likelihood of confounding due to temporal effects.

SARS-CoV-2 VOC B.1.1.7 is now the dominant lineage in Berlin. On the outpatient
