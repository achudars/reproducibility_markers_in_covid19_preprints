ABSTRACT
Background
With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk
factors associated with clinical outcomes.
Methods
A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was
conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and
critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as
favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic
regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression.
Results
Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the
study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with
clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking,
critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (>10
x 109/L) and neutrophilia (>75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the
use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also
confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary
treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive

troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide
early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by a
newly identified coronavirus, named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first
recognized in December 2019 in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China.1,2 The disease has spread
rapidly to more than 190 countries, and as of March 24, 2020, 422,915 confirmed cases and
18,915 deaths have been officially reported worldwide.3-7 With sustained transmission on six
continents, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared COVID-19 as a global
pandemic.
Most previous studies of COVID-19 have focused primarily on epidemiological and
clinical characteristics.8-12 Wang and co-workers compared the clinical features of 138
hospitalized patients with non-severe and severe COVID-19.10 Guan and colleagues updated the
clinical characteristic and disease severity in 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases throughout
China.12 Only a few studies have investigated risk factors and clinical outcomes.13,14 So, it is
urgent to identify potential novel risk factors and treatments associated with patient-centered
outcomes of COVID-19.
In this study, we analyzed the clinical course of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19
from January 8 to March 10, 2020, in Wuhan, to identify risk factors associated with clinical
outcomes for improving management guidelines.
METHODS
Study design
The institutional ethics board of Tianyou Hospital, an affiliate of the Wuhan University of
Science and Technology, approved the conduct of this retrospective review. Oral consent was

obtained from patients and written informed consent was waived. Tianyou Hospital is one of
several designated hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 in Wuhan.

Case definition
Electronic medical records (EMR) from inpatients with COVID-19 at Tianyou Hospital were
studied. Diagnosis complied with the WHO interim guidance15 and the guidelines of COVID-19
diagnosis and treatment trial 5th edition, by the National Health Commission of the People’s
Republic of China.16
The COVID-19 diagnosis was based on (1) the exclusion of other known infectious and
non-infectious causes of pneumonia; (2) exposure history in Wuhan in the most recent 14 days or
contact history with a confirmed patient or disease cluster; and (3) clinical presentation of fever,
respiratory symptoms, characteristic chest computer tomography (CT) image and/or leukopenia
and lymphopenia.

Data sources
A total of 323 patients were enrolled from January 8 to February 20, 2020. Real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed on throat swab specimens of
all patients. Clinical signs, disease onset, laboratory tests (including rRT-PCR and CT),
treatments, co-morbidities, complications, and outcome data were collected from EMR. All raw
data were initially assessed by trained physicians. Based on the clinical presentation at the time
of admission, patients were categorized into one of three groups: non-severe, severe and critical.
Clinical outcomes (favorable or unfavorable) were based on an average observation period of 28
days, with March 10, 2020 as the final follow-up date.

Clinical classification
The disease severity groups included the following: non-severe (patients showed fever,
respiratory symptoms and CT presentation of pneumonia; severe (patients showed respiratory
distress with RR≥30 breaths/min, oxygen saturation less than 93%, arterial partial pressure of
oxygen/oxygen concentration less than 300 mmHg); critical (patients showed respiratory failure
requiring ventilatory support, as well as shock and organ dysfunction requiring intensive care).

Clinical outcomes
Disease improvement or favorable clinical outcome included full recovery and discharge,
progression from critical/severe to non-severe disease status, PCR positive to negative, and/or
maintenance of non-severe status. Disease progression or unfavorable clinical outcome included
death, progression from non-severe to severe/critical disease status or severe to critical status,
and/or maintenance of severe or critical status.
Statistics Analysis
Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables measurements. For
continuous variables, student T-test or Mann-Whitney test was used. Multiple imputation was
conducted to handle missing data.17 Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. For survival analysis, the
survival time was defined as the interval from the date of admission to the date of death or
discharge. The association of risk factors with clinical outcome was analyzed using the KaplanMeier method and log-rank test. All analyses were implemented with R software (version 3.6.2)

values were two-sided, and those < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS
Clinical characteristics
Of the 323 patients with COVID-19, 186 (57.6%) were rRT-PCR positive and 137 (42.4%)
patients were rRT-PCR negative but had typical chest CT image, respiratory symptoms and
compatible blood test results at the time of admission. At the end of the study, 252 patients had
recovered and were discharged, 35 patients had died (overall case fatality rate, 10.8%), and 36
patients were still hospitalized.
Based on their initial clinical presentation, the 323 patients were classified into the nonsevere (151), severe (146) and critical (26) disease groups (Table 1). There was no gender
difference between the three groups. The median age of patients was 61 years (range, 23–91).
Patients over 65 years were overrepresented within the severe (43.2%, 63/146) and critical
(57.7%, 15/26) disease groups.
On admission, fever (83.9%, 271/323) and cough (50.8%, 164/323) were the most common
symptoms, while dyspnea (4.3%, 14/323), chest distress (0.9%, 3/323) and headache (0.9%,
3/323) were uncommon.

Clinical outcomes
The average observation period for the 323 patients was 28 days (range, 20–47 days). Favorable
outcomes were recorded in 260 patients and unfavorable outcomes in 63 patients. Among the
three disease severity groups, 86.8% (131/151) and 84.9% (124/146) of patients in the non-

Hu et al. 8

severe and severe groups, respectively, had favorable outcomes. By contrast, 80.8% (21/26) of
patients in the critical group had unfavorable outcomes (Figure 1A). Patients older than 65 years
showed more unfavorable than favorable outcomes. Patients with diabetes and body mass index
(BMI) of 30 were more likely to have unfavorable outcomes (Table 1).
Zopiclone, a cyclopyrrolone-class drug for insomnia, was administered at a dose of 1 mg
per day to 82 patients (25.4%) for the duration of their hospitalization. Overall, favorable
outcomes were recorded in 77 of these patients (Table 1). In comparing hypnotics and nonhypnotics use in patients within the three disease groups, favorable clinical outcomes were more
prevalent among patients on hypnotics (94.7% vs. 88.5% for non-severe, 95% vs. 74.6% for
severe, and 66.7% vs. 13.0% for critical) (p<0.05) (Figure 1B). And favorable clinical outcomes
were associated with the administration of hypnotics among rRT-PCR-positive and rRT-PCRnegative patients in each disease severity group (Figures 1C and 1D).

CT and laboratory abnormalities
The radiologic and laboratory test results are summarized in Table 2 (a complete version is
available as Supplementary Table S1). CT abnormalities were found in 314 patients. Groundglass opacity (GGO) findings were bilateral in 55.0% (83/151), 52.1% (76/146) and 26.9%
(7/26) of patients in the non-severe, severe and critical disease groups, respectively. Multiple
bilateral pulmonary consolidations and intralocular interstitial thickening were observed more
frequently among patients with unfavorable outcomes (11.1%, 7/63) than those with favorable
outcomes (0.8%, 2/260). Representative CT images related to clinical outcomes are shown in
Figure S1.

Laboratory findings between patients with favorable and unfavorable outcomes showed
differences in leukocyte and neutrophil counts and C-reactive protein, as well as lactate
dehydrogenase, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea
nitrogen, glucose, and serum amyloid A, which were all higher among patients with unfavorable
outcomes. Lymphopenia also occurred among 83.6% of patients with unfavorable outcomes,
while D-dimer showed no significant differences.
At the time of admission, the initial rRT-PCR was positive in 186 cases and negative in
137. rRT-PCR was positive more often among patients in the critical (84.6%) and severe
(65.1%) disease groups, than in the non-severe group (45.7%). Patients whose rRT-PCR were
initially negative also had better clinical outcomes, with only 9.5% (13/137) having unfavorable
outcomes.
Treatments and complications
Results related to treatment and complications are shown in Table 3. Oseltamivir (69.7%,
225/323), ganciclovir (71.2%, 230/323), and arbidol (208/323, 64.4%) were the three most
frequently used antiviral medications. And one or more courses of moxifloxacin, a broadspectrum antibiotic, was administered to 94.1% (304/323) of patients. Also, 60.7% (196/323) of
patients were given corticosteroid and glucocorticoid, and 95.7% (309/323) received alternative
therapy or traditional Chinese medicine. Kaletra® (lopinavir/ritonavir), an antiretroviral drug for
human immunodeficiency virus infection, was more administered to patients in the critical
disease group (46.2%) and in those with unfavorable than favorable outcomes (23.8% vs 5.0%).
Interferon-α was also given more often to patients with unfavorable than favorable outcomes
(9.5% vs. 6.2%). Other medications showed no significant differences in clinical outcomes.

Oxygen therapy via invasive ventilation and non-invasive ventilation was also given
more often to patients with unfavorable clinical outcomes. In comparing the outcome of each
treatment within the non-severe or severe or critical disease groups, there was no clear
improvement (Figure S2).
Of the 63 patients with unfavorable outcomes, complications, such as arrhythmia (74.6%
vs. 19.6%), acute lung injury (69.8% vs. 21.5%), shock (55.6% vs. 3.1%), acute cardiac injury
(33.3% vs. 1.2%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (20.6% vs. 0%), were significantly
more common in patients with favorable outcomes (Table 3).

Risk factors associated with clinical outcomes and survival analysis
A total of 27 categorical variables were identified in univariate logistic regression analysis,
namely: age, smoking, BMI, hypnotics, dyspnea, diabetes, malignancy, cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases, serum amyloid A, procalcitonin, hypersensitive troponin I, creatine
kinase CMB, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood
urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, leukocyte count, neutrophil count, platelet count, rRT-PCR at
diagnosis, clinical status at admission, bilateral GGO, crazy paving sign, diffuse patchy ground
glass and air bronchogram, and multiple bilateral pulmonary consolidation and intralobular
interstitial thickening (Table S2). Eight variables were demonstrated as independent risk factors
based on the multivariate logistic regression model. The results indicated that age (patients over
65 years) , smoking , critical disease designation , diabetes, abnormally higher hypersensitive
troponin I (>0.04 pg/mL) , leukocyte count (>10x109/L ) and neutrophil count (>75 x109/L)
were significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcome, and hypnotics showed
significant beneficial effects on clinical outcomes (p<0.001) (Figure 2A).

Patients in the non-severe group showed significantly better survival compared with
those in the severe and critical groups (Figure 2B). Patients given hypnotics showed significant
favorable survival compared with the non-hypnotics (Figure 2C), and patients with positive rRTPCR results showed significantly poorer survival compared with those with negative rRT-PCR
(Figure 2D).

DISCUSSION
In contrast to a previous study,12 most patients with COVID-19 in the severe group of our series
showed favorable clinical outcomes, at approximately the same frequency as in non-severe cases
(84.9% vs 86.8%), and survival analysis demonstrated consistently higher survival rates in nonsevere and severe cases than in critical cases. Although previous studies failed to show that
smoking was a risk factor for COVID-19,9,14 multivariate analysis in our study demonstrated that
smoking was an independent risk factor for unfavorable outcome. Otherwise, we confirmed
findings from other studies10,12,13 that age over 65 years and leukocytosis with left shift were
associated with poorer clinical outcome.
Zopiclone, a commonly prescribed nonbenzodiazepine soporific, was significantly
associated with improved clinical outcome. Patients taking hypnotics showed better outcome at
the same disease stage than those not taking hypnotics. For patients in the more severe disease
groups, the improvement effect was even more pronounced. Also, in analyzing the effect of
hypnotics on rRT-PCR-positive and rRT-PCR-negative patients separately, we found hypnotics
had more striking effect on the former. Moreover, hypnotics were identified as an independent
factor in the risk model that contributed to better clinical outcomes. Also, patients administered
hypnotics had a better survival rate.

Patients usually showed strong anxiety, sleep deficiency and oxygen insufficiency during
disease progression, which will lead to the metabolic dysregulation18,19 and immune system
abnormalities20. Better sleep quality and stress reduction could be one partial reason for
prescribing hypnotics to COVID-19 patients. Dimitrov et al indicated that sleep can exert some
immune-supportive effects and potentially enhance an effective T cell response, and it has high
relevant with some specific sleep disorders or impaired sleep, such as depression and chronic
stress.21
In addition, the superior efficacy of zopiclone may be due to enhanced gamma
aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling. That is, zopiclone can interact with GABAA, and GABAA
receptor can magnify responses to GABA.22 GABA signaling promotes autophagy activation,
which improves phagosome maturation and promotes host protection against infections.23 To our
knowledge, the beneficial effect of hypnotics on clinical outcome has not been reported
previously in the management of COVID-19 patients.
Up till now, several description studies have mentioned the non-effective function of
current medication treatment no matter which stages or outcomes was10,12,24, and it was accord
with our study analysis. By specifically comparing the standard treatment effect at the same
disease status for each treatment (Figure S2), we didn’t see any standard therapy could improve
clinical outcome in the study. However, since only about 25% of patients in our study took
hypnotics, we assume that self-healing could be the major reason for the high recovery rate of
patients in the non-severe and severe disease groups. That is, COVID-19 is most likely a selflimited disease in the majority of patients.
Both rRT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and clinically diagnosed patients who were
rRT-PCR negative were included in this study. Due to the burgeoning epidemic and high

exposure situation in Wuhan, the guidelines for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment indicated
that residents of Wuhan with clinical presentations suggestive of COVID-19 (including
respiratory symptoms, CT scan results and laboratory tests excluding other infectious causes of
pneumonia) could be admitted to hospital irrespective of the rRT-PCR result. Actually, all of the
rRT-PCR-negative patients had CT image features compatible with COVID-19. Moreover, the
high false-negativity of rRT-PCR (about 20-40%)25 presents a significant burden on health care
providers to use their clinical judgment. And chest CT has a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of
COVID-19 than rRT-PCR.25
Several underlying reasons including uneven quality from different detection kits,
improper collection of throat swab specimens, and low concentration of virus in samples26 can
lead to the possible results deviation. Therefore, including the rRT-PCR-negative patients was an
important measure to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan. We found that
patients in the severe or critical disease groups were more likely to be rRT-PCR positive.
Survival analysis also corroborated that rRT-PCR-positive patients showed poorer clinical
outcomes.
Since all patients in our study were tested by the same experienced team using the same
rRT-PCR protocol, we believe the major reason for the negative rRT-PCR results in our patient
series was due to the low concentration of virus in the throat, which may indicate that patients
with negative rRT-PCR test might be less likely to infect other people. We found that only a
small portion of patients (less than 10%) with negative rRT-PCR had unfavorable outcomes. In
performing follow-up rRT-PCR on patients in the severe disease group with abnormal CT, we
found 23 cases whose first test was negative and later tests were positive. We believe the

inclusion of rRT-PCR-negative patients with clinically compatible presentation of COVID-19
will help guide clinicians in the care of such patients.
Higher BMI (30), hyperglycemia and diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were distinct
risk factors for unfavorable clinical outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), which
serves as a cell-entry receptor for SARS CoV-2,27 plays a protective role for both diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases.28,29 Kuba and colleagues demonstrated that SARS CoV downregulates
ACE2 protein,30 which could explain why COVID-19 patients with diabetes and cardiovascular
disease have worse clinical outcomes.
We found that abnormally high hypersensitive troponin I was an independent predictor
for poor clinical outcome. Increased troponin can enhance coagulation activation.31 In patients
with COVID-19, immune damage to the hematopoietic system, ischemic hypoxia-reperfusion
injury, and drugs can cause coagulation disorders.8,31-34 We speculate that increased troponin will
induce dysfunction of coagulation and thrombus formation with possible pulmonary embolism,
which would further aggravate the patient’s condition.
There were some limitations in our study. Incomplete laboratory test results in some
patient records may have caused deviations in statistical analysis. Except for hypnotics, we found
that all treatments were ineffective and many treatments showed unwanted side effects, including
liver injury.35-37 Although we did not conduct separate analysis for rRT-PCR-positive and rRTPCR-negative patients, our multivariate analysis identified eight independent risk factors, which
were independent of the rRT-PCR result.
Although the vast majority of patients recovered, approximately 20% of our hospitalized
patient cohort had unfavorable clinical outcomes. To what extent chronic respiratory
insufficiency or other organ system sequelae occur in COVID-19 patients will require careful

and prolonged follow-up studies. So far, it seems there is no effective standard treatment.
However, we have found that using hypnotics could significantly improve clinical outcome of
COVID-19. We also found that some novel risk factors that could predict patient outcome,
which can help in early decision making for improving treatment outcomes of COVID-19
patients.

Figure legends:
Figure 1. Clinical outcomes for the three disease severity groups.
(A) Overall clinical outcomes of patients in the non-severe, severe, and critical disease groups.
The percentages are calculated by the number of each outcome group (Unfavorable or
Favorable) divided by the total number of patients in each group. (B) Clinical outcomes of
patients in the non-severe, severe, and critical disease groups who were either administered
hypnotics or not. (C) Clinical outcomes of RT-PCR-positive patients in the non-severe, severe,
and critical disease groups who were either administered hypnotics or not . D) Clinical outcomes
of RT-PCR-negative patients in the non-severe, severe, and critical disease groups who were
either administered hypnotics or not. The percentages are calculated by the number of each
outcome group (Unfavorable or Favorable) divided by the total number at each diagnosis status
with either using (Yes) or not using (No) hypnotics .

Figure 2. Multivariate regression and Kaplan-Meier curves of survival analysis.
(A) Factors showing significantly independent association with clinical outcome. Odds ratio,
95%CI, and P values are derived from logistic regression modelling. (B) Kaplan-Meier curve
demonstrating survival of COVID-19 patients by disease severity group: non-severe, severe, and
critical. (C) Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrating survival of COVID-19 patients by the usage of
hypnotics. (D) Kaplan-Meier curve demonstrating survival of COVID-19 patients by RT-PCR
results. P values for survival analysis are derived by the log-rank test.

Figure S1. Representative dynamic changes in chest computer tomography (CT) scans from two patients with COVID-19. A1–A3, CT images of a 70year-old male patient, who progressed from the non-severe to critical disease group, and died. A1 (day 1), A2 (day 4), A3 (day 9): below the pleura are scattered shadows of
frosted glass, large sheet diffuse paving stones in both lungs, and extensive consolidation of both lungs with thickening of interlobular stroma repetitively. B1–B3, CT images of a
44-year-old female patient, who progressed from the critical to non-severe disease group. B1 (day 3) exhibiting extensive consolidation of both lungs; B2 (day 9) exhibiting
frosted hyaline change and paving stone signs. B3 (day 20) showing significant resolution of ground-glass opacities and subpleural cord changes.
