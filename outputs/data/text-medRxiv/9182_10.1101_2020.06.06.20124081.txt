ABSTRACT

36

Background Several municipalities in the Lombardy Region have been affected by the SARS-

37

CoV-2 infection since the earliest stages of the epidemic. To date, 89442 confirmed cases have

38

been diagnosed in Lombardy, and mortality in several municipalities has already surpassed that

39

of the past decade. Currently, the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown

40

as several affected subjects may have been asymptomatic or have presented mild disease, thus

41

not resulting in the identified COVID-19 cases.

42

Methods This cross-sectional study aims to define the spread of infection within the population

43

by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 by rapid

44

immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on venous blood by

45

liquid phase immunochemical testing, also allowing to compare the two methods. Testing will

46

be performed on adults and minors residing, domiciled or working in several municipalities of

47

the Lombardy Region, involved in the initial stages of the epidemic. The study will include

48

rapid finger-prick testing and venous sampling for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, and

49

nasopharyngeal swabbing (NPS). Concurrent notification of test results will occur via the

50

regional healthcare information system (SISS).

51

Discussion This study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of

52

SARS-CoV-2 infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus.

53

Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the implementation of

54

effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures facilitating the identification

55

of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of contacts.

56

This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Milan

57

(35/2020).

BACKGROUND

85
86

Several municipalities of the Lombardy Region have been affected by the Severe Acute

87

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection since the earliest stages of the

88

epidemic. In fact, the first so called “red zone”, a quarantined area where all movements were

89

restricted, was established in the Lodi province (south-eastern Lombardy) on the 23rd of

90

February, following the first Coronavirus Induced Disease (COVID-19) hospitalization from

91

Codogno (LO).

92

To date, a total of 89442 SARS-CoV-2 cases have been confirmed in the Lombardy Region1,

93

however the true extent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. In particular, the

94

number of infected subjects having presented minimal or no symptomatology has not been

95

precisely determined.

96

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the existence of a coronavirus responsible

97

for pneumonia in Wuhan, China on December 29th 20192. This virus, initially identified as n-

98

CoV-2019 (novel Coronavirus 2019), was subsequently referred to as SARS-CoV-2, and its

99

clinical manifestations known as Coronavirus Induced Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The

100

pandemic was declared on March 11th 20203.

101

Currently, the WHO considers forwarding scientific knowledge on mass screening essential for

102

the battle against the spread of SARS-CoV-2, in order to allow better understanding and

103

planning of current and future containment policies.

104

All countries that have made extensive use of diagnostic testing on the whole population,

105

regardless of presence or absence of symptoms, have achieved a drastic drop in infection and

106

spread4.

107

To date, the only diagnostic tool to be officially recognized by the Italian Ministry of Health

108

for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the NPS, that uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase

109

chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to identify and amplify traces of the SARS-CoV-2 genome within a

110

patient’s sample5. This diagnostic method has several limits, including high costs, long

111

complete analysis times, and many false negatives (low diagnostic sensitivity).

112

Alongside the diagnostic aspect, the development of knowledge regarding disease spread and

113

prevalence in the population will become increasingly important in the near future. For this

114

reason, the development of research on seroprevalence with appropriate methods is of

115

fundamental importance.

116

This study was developed with the desire to understand the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2

117

infection and the epidemiological transmission characteristics of this virus in the earliest

118

affected areas in Italy. Understanding the spread and severity of the disease could help in the

119

implementation of effective infection surveillance containment and countermeasures

120

facilitating the identification of cases that have been exposed to the virus and the traceability of

121

contacts.

122
123

METHODS & DESIGN

124

The primary objective of this cross-sectional study is to determine the spread of infection within

125

the population by determining the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-

126

CoV-2 by rapid immunochromatographic testing and subsequent confirmation by serology on

127

venous blood by liquid phase immunochemical testing.

128

Secondary objectives include comparing IgG and IgM antibody positivity obtained by rapid

129

testing via direct viral research to serological data obtained by the immunochemical method.

130

We also aim to establish a database for future prospective projects eg. serial antibody titer

131

assessed over time, possibly expanding the study to several municipalities particularly affected

132

by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic around the Lombardy region. This may help localize and isolate

133

possible current and future outbreaks.

134

For the municipalities included in first so-called “red zone”, thus more severely hit, we

135

hypothesize a seroprevalence of IgG antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 between 30%

136

and 50%, due to probable unrestricted viral circulation in the days or weeks before the first

137

hospitalized case. For the other, less severely affected, municipalities we estimate a prevalence

138

between 10 and 30%.

139

According to current regional legislation (DGR n. XI/3114 and DGR n. XI/3131) during the

140

second phase of the epidemic, NPS will be performed in all symptomatic individuals, flagged

141

as “suspect COVID-19 cases” by their family doctor, and in all traced contacts prior to

142

readmission in society. Although rRT-PCR on NPS is the current gold standard diagnostic test

143

for SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic accuracy depends on several pre-analytical and analytical

144

variables, and many patients can be asymptomatic (thus currently will not receive testing in the

145

Lombardy region). The measurement of specific COVID-19 antibodies could serve as an

146

additional tool for disease detection and management, playing a potential key role in

147

surveillance and screening. The latter may be even more advantageous if implemented in the

148

form of rapid finger-prick testing. In fact, as mentioned above, one of our secondary objectives

149

is the comparison of IgG and IgM antibody positivity obtained by rapid testing, to serological

150

data obtained by the immunochemical method. We hypothesize that antibody detection by rapid

151

finger-prick testing will be non-inferior to detection by venous sampling.

152

Testing will be performed at specific locations in the various municipalities, equipped with the

153

following rooms:

154

•

155

A waiting room of suitable size to allow the simultaneous presence of 8-10 evenly
spaced (at least 1.8 m apart) individuals equipped with suitable PPE (surgical masks).

156

•

A room for collection of personal data and for carrying out rapid tests.

157

•

A room for the execution of venous blood samples.

158

•

A room for carrying out NPS.

162

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

163

All following subjects may be included in the study:

164
165

1. The entire adult population living in the municipality, including residential care
facilities.

166

2. All individuals over 18 who were present in the municipality on a daily basis for work

167

reasons during the epidemic eg. law enforcement officers, traders, workers in local

168

companies etc.

169
170

3. All minors residing and/or domiciled in the municipality, upon explicit
parental/guardian request.

171

An absolute exclusion criterion is represented by being quarantined. However, data regarding

172

quarantine will be taken into account for defining the dynamics of the epidemic.

173
174

Population follow-up and counseling

175

1. Individuals with negative results to rapid testing who do not present symptoms

176

suggestive for acute infection will be sent home, after counseling on appropriate

177

behaviors aimed at avoiding infection.

178

2. Individuals with negative results to rapid testing who, however, present symptoms

179

suggestive for acute infection will be evaluated by medical personnel to determine the

180

need for further investigations (imaging or ER access) and quarantined, at home or in a

181

different location if home is deemed unsuitable, pending swab results. These individuals

182

will receive extensive counseling on best-practices during the quarantine period.

183

3. Individuals with positive results to IgM rapid testing, regardless of IgG results, will be

184

quarantined at home, or in a different location if home is deemed unsuitable, pending

185

swab results. If swab results are also positive, quarantine will be confirmed and

186

extended and counseling on best-practices during the quarantine period will be

187

provided.

188

4. Individuals with positive results to IgG rapid testing only will be sent home, without

189
190

need for fiduciary quarantine.
5. Quarantined individuals will be provided with pulse oximeter, surgical masks and

191

extensive counseling on best-practices during the quarantine period.

192

6. All swab positive individuals, regardless of rapid test results, will be notified to local

193

health authorities using a specific infectious disease digital notification platform for the

194

Lombardy Region. The swab positive individual will thus be quarantined, and follow-

195

up will be carried out by the local health authorities, as indicated in current regional

196

protocols.

197
198

Results reporting

199

Rapid test results will be communicated in real time and a full report comprising collected

200

anamnestic and epidemiological data, and rapid test results will be emailed or printed, according

201

to patient preference.

202

NPS results will be communicated as follows:

203

-

In case of a negative result, attending medical personnel will call the patient directly.

204

-

In case of a positive result, attending medical personnel will call the patient’s family

205

doctor, who will then notify the local health authorities via the regional infectious

206

disease digital notification platform, and communicate the positive result to the patient.

Sample management

209

1. Rapid tests will be analyzed by assigned staff within the timeframe suggested by the

210

manufacturer and will then be suitably disposed of by the same staff (biohazardous

211

waste).

212
213

2. Venous blood samples will be stored on site, refrigerated at +4°C, and transported to
the lab for analysis, daily.

214

3. Swabs will be stored on site, refrigerated at +4°C, and transported to the lab for analysis,

215

daily (or within 48 hours during the weekend). NPSs are placed in a triple container

216

during transportation: the collection tube is placed in a conical tube (“falcon” type tube),

217

and then in a spill proof box.

218
219

Sampling plan and determination of sample size

220

For the purposes of the primary objective of the study, random sampling will be carried out

221

from the municipal registry list, stratifying by gender and conventional age classes (0-19; 20-

222

39; 40-59; >=60). At present, geographical stratification does not seem necessary given the

223

homogenous distribution of cases identified to date. Confirmed cases that have already been

224

identified in the municipality must be included in the study sample with the same probability

225

as other subjects. In fact, the rapid test and venous sample seroprevalence results on previously

226

confirmed cases will provide further data useful for comparison.

227

A sample size of 355 subjects from a population of 4616 individuals provides a bilateral 95%

228

confidence interval with an accuracy (half-amplitude) of 0.05 when actual prevalence is close

229

to 0.56. In case of higher or lower prevalence, the sample size decreases to 302 subjects in case

230

of prevalence equaling 0.3, very close to current estimates, and to 234 subjects in case of a more

231

skeptical prevalence hypothesis of 0.8. Considering the largest population sample combined to

232

a possible 20% drop-out, sample size increases to 444 subjects.

233

Assuming an infinite population7,8, sample size would be determined at 402 subjects, to be

234

increased to 503 subjects considering 20% drop-out. Thus, a sample size of around 500 subjects

235

would seem reasonable for the main study objective.

236

Regarding the secondary objective, relating to sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test

237

compared to the gold-standard on venous blood samples, the sample size required for a bilateral

238

95% confidence interval with a maximum amplitude of 0.1, is 527 subjects for sensitivity and

239

438 subjects for specificity, assuming a prevalence of 0.3 with optimal sensitivity and

240

specificity equal to 0.9. Thus, in order for both confidence intervals to have a maximum

241

amplitude of 0.1, the largest of the two sample sizes (527 subjects) must be chosen9. Also,

242

sample size should be further increased to 659 subjects to allow for 20% drop-out.

243

Accordingly, in case of hypothesized sensitivity and specificity values equal to 0.8, the sample

244

size should be increased to 880 subjects, and to 1100 subjects to include 20% drop-out.

245

However, in an optimal situation, the sample size required for the secondary objective appears

246

compatible with that needed for the primary objective. In fact, a study that could effectively

247

recruit at least 500 people would continue to offer expected amplitudes of confidence intervals

248

up to 0.144 for sensitivity and <0.1 for specificity, even in conditions of lower diagnostic

249

performance, always hypothesizing a prevalence of 0.3.

250

Sample size calculations were carried out using PASS v. 16.0.3 validated software.

251
252

DISCUSSION

253

Location and testing procedures

254

Testing will be performed at various locations in the selected municipalities, equipped with the

255

following rooms:

256
257

•

A waiting room of suitable size to allow the simultaneous presence of 8-10 evenly
spaced (at least 1.8 m apart) individuals equipped with suitable PPE (surgical masks).

258

•

A room for collection of personal data and performing rapid tests.

259

•

A room for the execution of venous blood samples.

260

•

A room for carrying out NPS.

261

•

A room for the dressing and undressing of healthcare workers.

262

•

A storage room with refrigerator.

263

Separate paths will be defined for the entrance and exit of tested subjects, particularly to prevent

264

loitering between individuals waiting to be tested and those already tested, as well as to prevent

265

large gatherings in confined spaces like corridors, making social distancing impracticable.

266
267

Subjects are tested as follows:

268

1. Assembly of up to 10 people every 30 minutes to be examined according to geographical

269

location. Participation in the study is voluntary. Those called upon must be equipped

270

with a correctly worn surgical mask. Security personnel will be assigned to ensure

271

correct use of PPE and compliance with safety distance.

272

2. Acquisition of informed consent.

273

3. Rapid testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all individuals in the assembled

274
275
276
277
278

group.
4. Anamnestic and personal data collection on a local network electronic database and
printing of labels for sample identification.
5. Venous blood sampling in all those resulting positive to the rapid test and, at random,
in a proportion of negative subjects, still to be determined.

279

6. Swabbing of all individuals resulting positive to the rapid test, all people with recent

280

history of symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and in a proportion of negative

281

subjects, yet to be determined, chosen at random.

282

Given that examining the largest number of people in the shortest time possible is of paramount

283

importance in a cross-sectional study, we decided to perform rapid testing as the first procedure,

284

and to gather epidemiological and anamnestic data while waiting for the appropriate reading

285

time (10 to 20 minutes). This will enable us to perform between 200 and 250 rapid tests per

286

day.

287
288

Personnel protection measures

289

Seeing as the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is still active in the Lombardy region, participant and

290

personnel safety will be a main concern. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitization

291

of all rooms and equipment will be guaranteed for the all duration of the study.

292

All patients must be equipped with a correctly worn surgical mask and disposable gloves.

293

PPE will be provided according to personnel role, as follows:

294

1. Surgical mask and disposable gown for personnel assigned to anamnestic, personal data,

295
296

and rapid test collection
2. FFP2 or equivalent filtered mask, surgical cap, visor, gloves and waterproof disposable

297

gown for personnel assigned to NPS collection and venous sample collection.

298

Moreover, we decided to position a plexiglass barrier with a specifically-designed hole through

299

which the rapid test is performed. This guarantees additional safety for personnel assigned to

300

rapid testing and data collection, without the discomfort of wearing PPEs. The same barrier was

301

proposed to the nurses assigned to venous blood sampling, but was not implemented based on

302

previous negative experiences with this method of blood collection through the plexiglass

303

barrier.

304

Rooms and surfaces will be sanitized three times a day using 0.1-0.5% sodium hypochlorite

305

solution for large surfaces eg. floors, walls, chairs; and 62-71% alcohol for small surfaces

306

(whenever there is biological contamination) and remaining instrumentation.

307

Sanitization will be carried out with disposable cloths or paper towels, to be suitably eliminated

308

(biohazardous waste).

309

Sanitization of any medical devices (sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, etc.) will be carried

310

out between each use.

311
312

Data management

313

Study data will initially be stored on a certified database of the i-Care platform, provided by

314

MEDISPA. Subsequently, an original database will be created, in collaboration with the

315

University of Milan Data Science Research Center, for data processing and analysis, according

316

to i-Care database data protection requirements, from which data transfer will take place.

317

Patient data will be traceable to a completely anonymous identification code (no data from

318

which patient identity could be derived will be recorded), thus only the doctor assigned to

319

patient data collection and, if required, subjects authorized by national privacy regulations will

320

be able to trace data back to the specific patient via the abovementioned identification code. In

321

any case, these subjects are bound by confidentiality according to current legislation. Patient

322

data will be made public only via scientific publications or conferences, and only in anonymous

323

aggregate form, always respecting current privacy laws (including but not limited to, “legge

324

privacy”, 18/05/2018, n. 51 Legislative Decree; and the EU (GDPR) 2016/67910.

325

The protection of individuals will also be guaranteed according to the Oviedo Convention 11 and

326

the Declaration of Helsinki regarding ethical principles for medical research involving human

327

subjects12, adopted by the World Medical Association in 1964.
