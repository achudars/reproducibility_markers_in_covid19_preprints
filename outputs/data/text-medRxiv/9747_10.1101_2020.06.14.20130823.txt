Abstract

23

Background

24

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a mass of academic papers being published in a very brief

25

span of time. Our aim was to compare the amount and reporting characteristics of COVID-19 related

26

peer-reviewed and pre-prints publications. We also investigated the amount of ongoing trials and

27

systematic reviews.

28

Methods and findings

29

A cross-sectional study of publications covering the COVID-19 pandemic time frame, up to May 20,

30

2020 was conducted. PubMed with appropriate combinations of Medical Subject Headings and

31

COVID-19 section of MedRxiv and BioRxiv archives were searched. We examined Clinicaltrial.gov,

32

Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, EU Register and 15 other trial registers as well as the international

33

prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). Characteristics of each publication source

34

were extracted. Regression analyses and Z tests were used to analyze publication trends over the weeks

35

and compare their relative proportions.

36

We found 3635 peer-reviewed publications and 3805 pre-prints, of which 8.6% (n=329) were

37

published in indexed journals. Peer-reviewed and pre-print publications amount both increased

38

significantly over time (p<0.001). Case reports (peer-reviewed: 6% vs pre-prints: 0.9%, p<0.001) and

39

letters (17.4% vs 0.5%, p<0.001) accounted for a greater share of the peer-reviewed compared to pre-

40

print publications. In turn, randomized controlled trials (0.22% vs 0.63% p<0.001) and systematic

41

reviews (0.08% vs 5%) accounted for a significantly greater share of the pre-print publications.

42

Clinicaltrials.gov, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and EU register included 57.9%, 49.5 % and 98.9%

43

trials mostly still “recruiting”. PROSPERO amounted to 962 systematic review protocols.

44

Conclusion

45

Pre-prints were slightly more prevalent than peer-reviewed publications, yet both are growing. To fill

46

the void given by the absence of published primary studies, immediate opinions (i.e., letters) has

47

virulently been published in PubMed. However, preprints has been promoted as rapid responses to give

48

direct and promptly access at scientific findings in this pandemic.

Introduction

54

A novel human coronavirus named by the World Health Organization as Severe Acute Respiratory

55

Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has been causing a pandemic of flu-like disease from the end

56

of 2019 (1). The global health emergency asked for urgent research priorities needed to inform the

57

public health response to the worldwide spread of 2019-nCoV infections (2). However, the enormity of

58

the scientific efforts and the speed at which the knowledge on this topic has been generated pose

59

significant difficulties for everyone to stay abreast of these developments (3). SARS-COV-2 has

60

sparked a parallel viral spread: science is being conducted, posted, and shared at an unprecedented rate.

61

A bibliometric and scientometric analysis of publications can quantitatively examine the research

62

progress of any topic and offer a comprehensive assessment of scientific research trends, which is

63

widely used for mapping knowledge in different scientific disciplines (4, 5). In an effort to address

64

challenges in Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) era and to better organize the emerging and

65

rapidly scientific developments, scoping reviews with a bibliometric and scientometric analyses have

66

been conducted (3, 6, 7) showing and visualizing the networks of contributing authors, institutions, and

67

countries. However, none of these reviews have focused on epidemiology and reporting characteristics

68

(8, 9) of this global burden assessing the evolution of research over the pandemic time (10-12). In the

69

COVID-19 burden, the scientific effort has been spread in different sources: registers of primary

70

studies (i.e, trials) and systematic reviews, preprints and peer-reviewed publications.

71

A clinical trials registry is a platform which catalogs registered clinical trials. Clinical trials can play an

72

important role in the COVID-19 to translate evidence of experimental and observational researches into

73

clinical practice (13, 14). Whereas, a systematic review protocol registry is an international database

74

which prospectively lists systematic reviews in health and social care. Systematic reviews should be

75

registered at inception (i.e. at the protocol stage) to help avoid outcome reporting biases, publication

76

bias, unplanned duplication and waste of resource, especially true in a period of global health

77

emergency (15, 16). Preprints are “preliminary reports of work that have not been certified by peer

78

review, at least yet. Hence, they should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related

79

behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information” (17). Preprint servers

80

are open access online repositories housing preprint research articles that on one hand enable authors to

81

make their research immediately and freely available to receive commentary and peer review prior to

82

journal submission accelerating the dissemination of scientific findings (18). Preprints posted during

83

the Ebola and Zika outbreaks included novel analyses and new data, and most of those that were

84

matched to peer-reviewed publications were available more than 100 days before publication (18). On

85

the other hand, many pre-prints never become certified by peer review: indeed, less than 5% of Ebola

86

and Zika journal articles were posted as preprints prior to publication in journals (18). Therefore,

87

information in preprints lack the scrutiny and validity of an external, scientific review (19). In the

88

pandemic era, an analysis of preprints and ongoing researches (i.e., trials and reviews) can be important

89

since timeliness is key, even though peer reviews are expedited for new relevant research.

90
91

Aims

92

In the context above, we aim to provide a snapshot of the amount of scientific development on COVID-

93

19 worldwide, which may inform the current status of global research and provide insights on the needs

94

for future research in terms of its amount, design, publication venues, and reporting characteristics.

95

More specifically, we aim to do so by:

96

1) Comparing the amount of COVID-19 related research in peer-reviewed publications or pre-prints

97

(not peer-reviewed), including as stratified by key reported characteristics: species (ie. humans,

98

animals), study design (such as systematic reviews (SRs), randomized controlled trials (RCTs)) and

99

research area (such as drug treatment).

100

2) Inspect the amount and key reported characteristics of COVID-19 ongoing research in the registers

101

of clinical trials and systematic reviews (e.g., research Area).

Design: Cross-sectional study of publications and its key study and reporting characteristics COVID-19

105

related publications until May 20 2020.

106
107

Data sources

108

We searched for COVID-19 peer-reviewed publications in PubMed database through its indexation

109

system. PubMed is a comprehensive research database comprised of more than 30 million citations, as

110

of May 2020, for biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books (20). In

111

the health field, there is evidence that adding databases other than PubMed only had modest impact on

112

SR results (21). In PubMed, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) are organized in a hierarchical tree and

113

assigned to each paper by subject-specialist indexers. For COVID-19, we used the Supplementary

114

Concept Records (SCRs). MEDLINE indexers regularly come across substances in the literature that

115

are not currently MeSH headings. When this happens, the National Library of Medicine staff adds

116

these substances to the MeSH vocabulary as Supplementary Concept Records (SCRs). While MeSH

117

headings are updated annually, new SCRs are added weekly. Therefore, COVID-19 articles are

118

systemically indexed by research topic regardless of the specific words used by the authors. We

119

conducted target searches in PubMed that included the use appropriated combinations of MeSH terms

120

and SCRs (i.e. search filters) related to COVID-19 and related terms (e.g. SARS-COV-2, coronavirus

121

disease), filtered for specie, research designs, and research area (See S1 Appendix. PubMed

122

database).

123

We searched the two popular sources for COVID-19 related preprints, MedRxiv and BioRxiv

124

databases, proxy indicators of scientific not peer-reviewed literature. Papers are examined by in-house

125

staff who check for issues such as plagiarism and incompleteness (22) (see S1 Appendix. Preprints

126

MedRxiv and BioRxiv database).

127

We then investigated all primary registries that meet the requirements of the International Committee

128

of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) according to the WHO Registry Network. Primary registries in the

129

WHO Registry Network meet specific criteria for content, quality and validity, accessibility, unique

130

identification, technical capacity and administration (23). Additionally, we searched for International

131

prospective register of systematic reviews focusing on PROSPERO database (see S1 Appendix.

132

Primary register; S1 Appendix. PROSPERO register).

133

The whole searches in all sources were run in May 20, 2020 without restrictions on languages.

134
135

Data extraction

136

Data records obtained from PubMed, MedRxiv and BioRxiv, Trials registers and PROSPERO database

137

were imported to Excel for further grouping and analyses. Then the whole data extraction was

138

performed by one author and checked by the second author. Any uncertainties were discussed among

139

the data extractors.

140

For the peer-reviewed publications and pre-prints, we extracted the bibliometric data and then analyzed

141

and summarized the subsets focusing on the following study or reporting characteristics: specie (i.e.,

142

humans, animals), publication type (i.e., SRs, RCTs, Epidemiologic Studies, Letter), the distribution by

143

research area such as vaccine, treatment drug treatment, rehabilitation, diagnostic testing, measures for

144

infection prevention and control (i.e., social distance, masking), biology, according to the indexation

145

facilities and the respective search tags or filters. Since in the pre-prints no such filters/tags exists, we

146

manually extracted and coded the above topics. The study designs such as laboratory experiments (e.g.,

147

genomics), prognostic models were included in the epidemiology studies.

149

For the primary registers (e.g., trials), the following characteristics were filtered/tagged and extracted:

150

country, study type, phase, recruiting status. For data of PROSPERO database species and research

151

area/tag have been extracted.

152
153

Data analysis

154

Initially, descriptive statistics were used for the analysis. Over the volume of publications for each data

155

element (e.g. publication type), percentages and frequencies were computed and displayed in tabular

156

formats, paired between peer-reviewed and pre-print sources. After that, the amount of publications

157

over time (weekly) was plotted into a run chart. Then, simple linear regressions methods with the

158

ANOVA were used to analyze the growth of the number of COVID-19 publications over the weeks.

159

Finally, two-sample Z-tests, two tails, analyzed whether the proportion of each characteristics of peer-

160

reviewed source (i.e., PubMed) significantly differed from those of pre-print sources. P values <0.05

161

were considered significant. The data were stored and analyzed using STATA 16 software.

162
163

Results

164

We respond to each of our two specific study objectives in the respective subsections below.

165

1) Amount and Characteristics of COVID-19 research peer vs not peer-reviewed (pre-print)

166

publications

167

From December 2019 to May 2020, a total of 7440 COVID-19 related publications were found. From

168

these, 3635 (48.9%) were peer-reviewed, and 3805 (51.1%) were preprints. Fig 1 reports the weekly

169

amount of both peer-reviewed and pre-print publications, from December 2019 to May 2020. The

170

increase of peer-reviewed and pre-print publications are both statistically significant over time (peer-

171

reviewed publications: p<0.001 r2=0.8239, and pre-prints: p<0.001 r2=0.9133, respectively). Figs 2

172

and 3 shows the absolute and relative frequencies of peer-reviewed and pre-prints publications over

173

each week. Fig 4 shows the trend of the ratio between relative frequencies of peer-reviewed and pre7

174

prints publications over weeks. The difference of the increase rate among relative frequencies between

175

the two groups was found not statistically significant over weeks (p=0.2388, r2=0.0856).

Table 1 shows the reporting characteristics for both peer-reviewed and pre-prints COVID-19 related

188

publications. In both peer-reviewed publications and pre-prints, “human” subjects were predominant as

189

well as the most addressed research areas were prevention and control (26.1%, 950/3635 peer-reviewed

190

vs 42.4%, 1615/3805 pre-prints; p<0.001) and diagnosis (21.5%, 781/3635 peer-reviewed vs 25.3%,

191

962/3805 pre-prints; p<0.001).

192

Regarding the relative prevalence of study types, statistically significant differences were found among

193

peer-reviewed and pre-print publications. For instance, RCT designs were significantly more common

194

among pre-prints than among the peer-reviewed research (peer-reviewed: 0.2%; 8/3635 vs pre-prints:

195

0.6%, 24/3805; P<0.001). Similarly, SRs were significantly more common among preprints (peer8

196

reviewed: 0.8%, 29/3635 vs pre-prints: 5.0%, 193/3805; P<0.001). Observational studies were also

197

significantly more common in pre-print research than peer-reviewed publications (peer-reviewed:

198

0.6%, 21/3635 vs pre-prints: 24.7%, 940/3805; P<0.001). For case reports and letters, the picture was

199

reverse: these were significantly more common in peer-reviewed publications with a substantial

200

amount of letters to the editor (case reports, peer-reviewed: 6.0%, 219/3635 vs pre-prints: 0.9%,

201

35/3805; P<0.001; letters, peer-reviewed: 17.4%, 632/3635 vs pre-prints: 0.5%, 19/3805; P<0.001).

202

Overall, in both peer-reviewed publications and pre-prints the most addressed research areas were

203

prevention and control (26.1%, 950/3635 vs 42.4%, 1615/3805; P<0.001) and diagnosis (21.5%,

204

781/3635 vs 25.3%, 962/3805).

205

Among pre-print publications, the 8.6% (329/3805) have been converted into peer-reviewed journals,

206

up to the covered dates, among which the two study designs most published were the observational

207

study (87.8%, n=289/329) and the RCT (5.6%, n=18/329) while the research areas of most interest

208

were prevention and control (40.7%, n=134/329) and diagnosis (31.6%, n= 104/329).

Table 2 shows that, in the Clinicaltrials.gov, 1621 of the 339863 records were focused on COVID-19

219

disease (0.5%). In turn, 652 of the 32553 records included in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry

220

(ChiCTR), were focused on COVID-19 disease (2%). No other register had over 200 records of

221

COVID-19 research.

222

Table 3 reported characteristics of the two primary registries with most volume of research COVID-19

223

related. The most investigated study type were the interventional studies in Clinicaltrials.gov as well as

224

in ChiCTR (respectively, 60% and 50%), with the phase 3 most reported in Clinicaltrials.gov (15%).

225

Regarding recruiting status, the most prevalent was “ongoing” across all registers (min-max: 47%-

226

99%).

227

Table 4 provided reporting characteristics of PROSPERO database about the registered COVID-19

228

related systematic reviews. Almost all are focused on humans (99.7%) with the two most research areas

229

addressed to the treatments (19.1%) and health impacts (16.6%).

Discussion

248

The spread of COVID-19 has rapidly been matched by an impressive rise in related publications in

249

both peer-reviewed journals and pre-print servers (respectively, 3805 and 3635 records in about five

250

months, with both a significant statistically increase [p< 0.001]). However, it is critical for clinicians,

251

researchers and other stakeholders (e.g., government officers) to be able to identify, in a timely manner,

252

accurate, reliable and trustworthy research. The snapshot we obtained reveals the publication and study

253

register data on the first scientific endeavors to pandemic. To fill the void given by the absence of the

254

published primary studies, immediate opinions (i.e., letters, editorials and comments) has virulently

255

been published in the peer-reviewed literature, whereas empirical studies, including epidemiologic

256

aiming to discover the foundations for biologic, prognostic and prevention and controls research areas,

257

have been more commonly seen among pre-prints, up to May 20, 2020.

258

Our findings reflect a staged maturity of the research development. Even though the number of

259

recorded publications was found high and increasingly sharply in just a few months (not counting the

260

last few weeks likely due to indexation delays), we also found few higher-hierarchy evidence

261

publications like systematic reviews/meta-analysis (n=29) and randomized controlled trials (n=8) in

262

peer-reviewed journals. Others have found, similarly, a limited number of high-quality study designs

263

on the COVID-19 disease (14, 24, 25). There has been insufficient time to design, approve, execute,

264

and report such type of study designs; hence, it is probable that the percentage of these can rise over the

265

upcoming months. For instance, the numbers of trials protocols

266

“ongoing” in clinicaltrials.gov as well as in ChiCTR (respectively, n=795 and n=308) provide and

267

indicator of that upward trend. From both registers, we retrieved a total of 2273 trials: the growth of

268

this amount is remarkable since it has been reported on February 22, 2020, a total of 171 COVID-19-

269

related interventional trials (138 from ChiCTR and 33 from ClinicalTrials.gov (26) and on March 24,

270

2020, a total of

271

ClinicalTrials.gov) (27). This amount is justified by the breakthrough news from pandemic countries

272

(such as China) which drew significant attention to drug interventions (such as azithromycin,

that were found registered as

614 COVID-19-related interventional trials (471 from ChiCTR and 143 from

273

hydroxychloroquine and antiviral drug)(28).

274

Besides, an important amount of systematic review protocols has been also registered in PROSPERO

275

(n=962), and mainly focused on research treatments. However, these reviews can be limited by the low

276

amount of clinical trials, or the lower quality of them (14). Indeed, secondary literature can be

277

supported by indirect evidence represented by primary studies involving different patients from those

278

of interest (i.e., COVID-19) as suggested by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,

279

Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach (29).

280

The clinical development process to find answers, treatments and vaccines for pandemics is stronger if

281

based on the highest levels of evidence such as systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials.

282

Companies and universities have been doing their best to accelerate experimental drugs and vaccines

283

for COVID-19 through their pipeline (30). The World Health Organization (WHO)’s Blueprint list

284

recognized coronaviruses as disease of priority importance: given the public health emergencies of

285

international concern and the absence of efficacious drugs and vaccines, coronaviruses disease are

286

considered to need accelerated research and development (31). For the duration of the Coronavirus

287

disease (COVID-19) outbreak several journals supported the immediate available publications through

288

preprints posted online (32-34). However, until the pre-print is not published in a notable peer-

289

reviewed journal it might get stuck in the limbo of credibility. We found only the 8% of pre-prints been

290

published as peer-reviewed publications: does the explanation for such low percentage rely on too little

291

time for convertion into a published version and a consequent delay of publication? Or is it merely a

292

waste of research? On one hand, the time it takes for a completed manuscript to be published

293

traditionally can be lengthy, up to 166 days for a preprint to be posted as DOI of a journal article (35).

294

Article publication delay, often due to constraints associated with the peer review process, can prevent

295

the timely dissemination of information in a global health emergency as COVID-19 pandemic (35). On

296

the other hand, studies that remain unpublished, research’s “dark side of the moon”, could represent a

297

waste of efforts and money annually invested in health and medical research globally (36, 37). It also

298

happens that important results in some areas (such as mathematics) have been published only on

299

preprint servers as ArXiv (38, 39). The potential harm from posting erroneous provisional research is

300

one reason why the medical community was so cautious about preprints in the first place (40).

301

However, to date, it is interesting to observe that pre-prints are actually gaining more attention and

302

citations than the corresponding peer-reviewed article (41). For the COVID-19 related articles, it is still

303

soon to analyze citation trends; yet, the publication trends here reviewed (i.e. up to May 20, 2020)

304

showed a higher amount of preprints than peer-reviewed publications and higher percentage of

305

empirical research among preprints. This contrasts with the findings from Lv et al up to February 6,

306

2020, such as those that articles in peer-reviewed journals accounted for 77.1% of the study

307

publications, pre-prints 14.1%, while 8% of the articles were merely posted online (42). Explanations

308

for these discrepancies can rely on the substantial amount of recent empirical studies that have been

309

more rapidly available in preprint serves and not in peer-reviewed forms, at least yet. A better fruition

310

of the trusted science can be enhanced by the better utilization of preprints. Preprints aim to give a

311

new, faster, and iterative alternative or complement to the current journal publication and peer review

312

system, proposing catalyze biomedical discovery, support career advancement, and improve scientific

313

communication (35). If all publishers endorsed preprint posting for research, this would become an

314

intrinsic preliminary step prior to the publication giving a clear signal to all scientists that preprints are

315

integral part to scientific communication (18). Tracking the pre-print into the publication process can

316

allow to control the reliability of research and distinct it from the final peer-reviewed publication. Also,

317

it might give benefit for both individual authors and the scientific community. The former can

318

immediately share their research and getting attention early, the latter can have direct access to the

319

most updated research, give feedback to improve manuscripts, arise discussion leading to new ideas,

320

follow-up studies, or collaborations with other research groups (43). This might be viewed as a

321

reinforcement and an essential step toward a more open and transparent peer review process which is

322

the cornerstone of our scientific activities and the full-proof system that ensures only quality research

323

papers released into the scientific community (19). Commentaries, letters to editors and other forms of

324

non-research publications were found essentially in peer-reviewed publication venues. These

325

publication types seem less prone for a preprint form, or on the contrary benefit highly from

326

certification by external peer-review in terms of not being essentially biased or personal perspectives.

327

In turn, on empirical research, informed readers can more objectively appraise the research methods,

328

the data presented, the validity of its conclusions, or limitations that are applicable, either in preprint or

329

peer-reviewed versions. To answer the pandemic needs, the best challenge in this emergency would be

330

increase the amount of completed and published research and translate it into practice.

331
332

Limitations of the study

333

This study only covers journals and publications indexed in PubMed: a comprehensive but not

334

exhaustive health research database. For pre-prints we used the COVID-19 section of these servers to

335

investigate the preprint versions at the time of our data extraction. Our data collection period was a

336

tightly defined window (December 2019-May 2020). However, since no filter nor topics are present for

337

selecting pre-prints categories and the average time taken to display search results is not always

338

optimal in the servers (44), a preferred hand screening was made. This partly threatens the validity of

339

the comparisons of study types between peer-reviewed and preprint publications An illustrative

340

example may be that of the epidemiologic studies: in pre-prints, we recorded different study designs as

341

mentioned in the Methods section (such as Case-Control Studies, Cross-Sectional Studies but also

342

extending to biologic and mathematical models), whereas in PubMed we involved the regular MeSH

343

term that includes a clustered study designs (such as Case-Control Studies, Cross-Sectional Studies).

344

Besides, epidemiological studies are indexed in PubMed not as a “publication type” like RCTs; this can

345

affect the reliability, accuracy, and speed of the indexation of epidemiological studies in PubMed, e.g.

346

compared to pre-print servers. This may help explain why many studies in detected PubMed had no

347

classification for study type yet (i.e. the sum of the articles indexed for study types was clearly below

348

the total number of papers identified). Yet, clear-cut publication types like RCTs or letters to editors

349

may have had a faster a more reliable indexation. It could be reasonable to infer that many of the

350

studies without indexation for a publication or study type could be other than RCT or

351

commentaries/letters (e.g. epidemiologic, secondary data analysis, etc). Although indexation of

352

COVID-19 research has been prioritized, delays may apply and these may have been visible in the data

353

we obtained for the weeks of May, 2020.

354

When needed (i.e. when search filters or tags could not be reliably applied), manual coding was applied

355

by one researcher and verified by another rather than by two independent researchers. This is an option

356

typical of rapid review types, and a compromise needed to accelerate the results in an issue in which

357

the timeliness of the results is key and a certain degree of uncertainty on the precision of the results.

358

We did not adjusted characteristics for the country’s population size, for example by using World

359

Bank’s data in order to facilitate any comparison on the amount of studies per country

360

(https://data.worldbank.org/).

361
362

Conclusion

363

There is an unprecedented increase of publications amount on COVID-19 since the disease emerged.

364

There is a delay of accurate, reliable and trustworthy publication research. The vast majority of

365

scientific literature in the first five months of this epidemic outbreak is based on perspectives (e.g.

366

letters to the editor or commentaries) or reported (i.e. secondary) data rather than primary data. As

367

well, a large number of registered trials and systematic review with very few results were published so

368

far. The research focused on effective preventive/control and therapeutic strategies are still emerging

369

reflecting the initial response by the research community. For rapid responses, science should promote

370

preprints as a challenge and opportunity to give direct access to their research by submit them to

371

journals that accept preprints for their policies. However, at a time when journal editors and invited

372

reviewers are more solicited than ever, screening and reviewing preprints might benefit both the

373

authors and the scientific community and can provide the general public with timely access to scientific

374

discussion, helping to reinforce scientific credibility (33). Cautions should be taken regarding the

375

phenomenon of “publish or perish”: the efforts and time should be devoted to develop significant and
