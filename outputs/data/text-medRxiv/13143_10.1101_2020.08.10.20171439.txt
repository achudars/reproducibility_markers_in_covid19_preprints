Abstract

An extended SEIQR type model is considered in order to model the COVID-19 epidemic. It
contains the classes of susceptible individuals, exposed, infected symptomatic and asymptomatic,
quarantined, hospitalized and recovered. The basic reproduction number and the final size of epidemic are determined. The model is used to fit available data for some European countries. A
more detailed model with two different subclasses of susceptible individuals is introduced in order
to study the influence of social interaction on the disease progression. The coefficient of social
interaction K characterizes the level of social contacts in comparison with complete lockdown
(K = 0) and the absence of lockdown (K = 1). The fitting of data shows that the actual level
of this coefficient in some European countries is about 0.1, characterizing a slow disease progression. A slight increase of this value in the autumn can lead to a strong epidemic burst.
Keywords: COVID-19, reproduction number, two group model, relapse.

1 Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is now considered as the biggest global threat
worldwide. This disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) which belogs to a group of RNA virus causing respiratory track infection that can range mild to
lathel [1]. The first outbreak of COVID-19 was noticed in Hubei province, Wuhan, China [2] in
December 2019. Then it spread all over the world so rapidly that the World Health Organization
(WHO) revealed the COVID-19 to be a public health emergency and identified it as a pandemic on
March 11, 2020. Since December 2019, the first COVID-19 infected person was diagnosed, the
COVID-19 quickly spread to all Chinese province and, as of 1 April 2020, to 200 countries and
regions with the number of reported infected cases and the number of documented death reached 19
million and 717,792, respectively [3]. Among these countries, the more serious epidemic situations
are in the United States (5,032,278 total cases, 162,804 death cases), Brazil (2,917,562 total cases,
98,644 death cases), India (2,030,001 total cases, 41,673 death cases), Russia (871,894 total cases,

death cases), Spain (354,530 total cases, 28,500 death cases), Germany (215,210 total cases, 9,252
death cases), France (195,633 total cases, 30,312 death cases), and Iran (320,117 total cases, 17,976
death cases). In particular, the number of infection cases in the United States has grown very fast, the
number of reported infected cases increases from 15 to 288,721 spending 82 days [3].
The most alarming part of this disease is that the symptoms of this disease are not specific and
in many cases the infected person may be asymptomatic (who can infect persons without showing
any symptoms of the disease). The majority of the cases initially have symptoms like common cold
which includes dry cough, fever, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, headache, shortness of breathe etc.
Moreover, the growth of this infection further proceed to acute respiratory distress syndrome which
can lead to even death. It is also observed in an age-stratified analysis [4] that the large number of
severe cases in particular for the age groups above 60 and having other medical issues like diabetics,
kidney problems etc. The COVID-19 virus spreads at large extend between people when they come
in close contact with each other and the virus is transmitted through expelled droplets which enter a
person’s body through contact routes such as the mouth, eyes or nose. Contact with various surface is
another means for contracting the virus. In the absence of a definite treatment modality like medicine
or vaccine, physical distancing, wearing masks, washing hands etc. have been accepted globally as
the most efficient strategies for reducing the severity and spread of this virus and gaining control over
it at some extend [5]. So, the government of most of the countries had decided to go for complete
lockdown from mid or end of March, 2020. This complete lockdown also affected the economy of
those countries in a large extend. So, from the mid of the month of May, 2020, all the countries have
taken some policies for unlocking gradually.
Mathematical models of infectious disease dynamics nowadays became a very useful and important tool for the analysis of dynamics of infectious disease, to predict the future course of an outbreak
and to evaluate strategies to control an epidemic in recent years. The global problem of the outbreak
of COVID-19 has attracted the interest of researchers of different areas. Mathematical modeling
based on system of differential equations may provide a comprehensive mechanism for the dynamics
of COVID-19 transmission. Several modeling studies have already been performed for the COVID19 outbreak [6–11]. In [12], Lin et. al. suggested a conceptual model for the coronavirus disease
2019, which effectively catches the time line of the COVID-19 outbreak. A mathematical model
for reproducing the stage-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus by Chen et.al in [13]. Wu et
al. developed a susceptible exposed infectious recovered model (SEIR) based on the reported data
from December. 31st 2019 till January 28th 2020, to clarify the transmission dynamics and projected
national and global spread of disease [14]. They also calculated the basic reproduction number as
around 2.68 for COVID-19. Tang et al proposed a compartmental deterministic model that would
combine the clinical development of the disease, the epidemiological status of the patient and the
measures for intervention. Researchers also found that the amount of control reproduction number
may be as high as 6.47, and that methods of intervention including intensive touch tracing followed
by quarantine and isolation would effectively minimize COVID cases [15]. For the basic reproductive
number (R0 ), Read et al. reported a value of 3.1 based on the data fitting of an SEIR model, using
an assumption of Poisson-distributed daily time increments [16]. S. Zhao et al. estimated the mean
R0 for 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 (likely to be below 5
but above 3 with rising report rate) [17], which appeared slightly higher than those of SARS-CoV
(R0 : 2-5) [18]. A report by Cambridge University has indicated that India’s countrywide three-week
lockdown would not be adequate to prevent a resurgence of the new coronavirus epidemic that could
bounce back in months and cause thousands of infections [19]. They suggested that two or three
lockdowns can extend the slowdown longer with five-day breaks in between or a single 49-day lockdown. Data-driven mathematical modeling plays a key role in disease prevention, planning for future
outbreaks and determining the effectiveness of control. Several data-driven modeling experiments

have been performed in various regions [15]. In [20], a compartmental mathematical model to try to
understand the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mexico. This data driven analysis would let us compare
how different the outbreak will be in the two studied regions. By this approach, authorities can plan
a health care program and control the spread even with limited resources. In Rojas et al. [21], the
authors estimated the value of R0 which helped them to predict that in the city of Cali the outbreak
under current intervention of isolation and quarantine will last for 5-6 months and will need around
3500 beds on a given during the peak of the outbreak. Some other relevant works where the basic
reproduction number is estimated for different countries can be found in [22–28].
The most common mathematical formulations which represent the individual transition in a community between ‘compartments’ describe the situation of individual infection with a significant insight. These models of compartmental disease segregate a population into groups depending on each
individual’s infectious state and related population sizes with respect to time. There is a wide range of
mathematical models and approaches adopted by different researchers to develop viable mathematical
model to understand the propagation of disease spread for COVID-19 with different model assumptions. In our present work we have proposed and analyzed an ordinary differential equation model
to study the COVID-19 disease propagation which consists with initially six compartments namely
susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalised and recovered. We have divided the exposed
compartment into two sub-compartments E1 and E2 depending on their infectiousness and also divided the infected class into two sub-compartments namely asymptomatic (Ia ) and symptomatic (Is ).
Interesting and significant contribution of our work is the consideration of time dependent rate of
infection over various periods of time. This variation is adopted into the model in order to capture the
effect of lockdown, social distancing etc. which plays a crucial role to reduce the disease spread. Next
we have discussed the basic properties of our model and calculated the basic and controlled reproduction number. Final size of the epidemic is also described. Next we have divided susceptible, exposed
and infected classes into two sub-classes each based on their classification or behaviour which is directly responsible for the alteration of rate of disease spread. The classification or division into two
different groups may be due to the different age groups, different implementation of distancing measures, proper and improper use of face mask and so on. Then we have calculated the reproduction
number and maximum size of the epidemic for the new model. Next we have copulated the sensitivity
index to identify the parameters of greater interest and then fitted those parameter values with the data
of total cumulative cases of COVID-19 for different countries (Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK). Then
we have shown that with those best fitted parameter values our model simulation is matching well
with the 95% confidence interval of the daywise cumulative and daily case data which proved the
viability of our model system. This also depict the fact that nature of the disease transmission is different for different countries depending on the protective measures and policies taken by government,
different age distribution of the population, lack of consciousness etc.

2 Mathematical Model – 1
In the following, we consider a dynamic SEIQR type model for the COVID-19 disease propagation.
Basically the model consists with Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Quarantined (Q),
hospitalized (J) and Recovered (R) class. In the context of COVID-19, the exposed class is divided
into two subclasses namely non-infectious (E1 ) and infectious (E2 ) and the infected class is divided
into two sub- classes namely asymptomatic (Ia ) and symptomatic (Is ), where N = S + E1 + E2 +
Ia + Is + Q + J + R and N is not fixed since deceased individuals are not considered in the model.
The model assumptions are given as follows:
Susceptible population S(t): This subpopulation will decrease after an infection due to the interaction with an symptomatic infected individual (Is ), asymptomatic infected individual (Ia ), infectious

exposed individual (E2 ), quarantine (Q) or hospitalised one (J). The transmission coefficients will
be βIs , βp1 Ia , βp2 E2 , βp3 Q and βp4 J respectively. Here β is rate of infection per unit of time by
the symptomatic infected, p1 , p2 , p3 and p4 are the reduction factor of infectivity by Ia , E2 , Q and J
respectively compared to Is and satisfy the restriction 0 ≤ pj < 1, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. The rate of change
of the susceptible population is expressed in the following equation:
βS
dS
= − (Is + p1 Ia + p2 E2 + p3 Q + p4 J).
dt
N
Exposed polulation E(t): The exposed population (in the incubation period) is divided into two sub
classes: (i) exposed population who are at the beginning of the incubation period and cannot spread
the disease (E1 (t)) and (ii) exposed population who are at the end of the incubation period and can
spread the disease (E2 (t)). The transfer mechanism from the class S(t) to the class E1 (t) is guided
(Is + p1 Ia + p2 E2 + p3 Q + p4 J) and from the class E1 (t) to the class E2 (t) is
by the function βS
N
guided by µE1 , where µ is the rate at which individuals of E1 class become infectious exposed (E2 ).
The population E2 will decrease due to the transfer into the infected population with rate δ. Thus the
rate of change of the exposed population is expressed in the following two equations:
dE1
βS
=
(Is + p1 Ia + p2 E2 + p3 Q + p4 J) − µE1
dt
N
dE2
= µE1 − δE2 .
dt
Infected polulation I(t): The infected population is divided into two subclasses (i) asymptomatic
(having no symptoms) (Ia ) and (ii) symptomatic (having symptoms) (Is ). The transfer mechanism
from the class E2 (t) to the class Ia (t) is guided by the function (1 − σ)δE2 and from the class E2 (t) to
the class Is (t) is guided by the function σδE2 where σ (0 < σ < 1) is the fraction of E2 that becomes
symptomatic infected (Is ). The population Ia will decrease due to the transfer into the recovered
population with a rate η and Is will decrease with a rate (ρ1 + ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3 ), where ρ1 is the rate of
mortality due to the infection, ζ1 , ζ2 and ζ3 are the rate at which Is becomes quarantined, recovered
and hospitalised respectively. Thus the rate of change of the infected population is expressed in the
following two equations:
dIa
= (1 − σ)δE2 − ηIa ,
dt
dIs
= σδE2 − (ρ1 + ζ1 + ζ2 + ζ3 )Is .
dt
Quarantined population Q(t): This subpopulation will increase due to the transfer from the class
Is (t) with a rate ζ1 and will decrease with a rate (ξ1 + ξ2 ), where ξ1 and ξ2 are the rates at which Q becomes hospitalized and recovered respectively. Thus the rate of change of the quarantined population
is expressed in the following equation:
dQ
= ζ1 Is − (ξ1 + ξ2 )Q.
dt
Hospitalized population J(t): This subpopulation will increase due to the transfer from the classes
Is (t) and Q(t) with rates ζ3 and ξ1 respectively and will decrease with a rate (ρ2 + ν), where ρ2 is the
rate of mortality due to the infection and ν is the rate at which J becomes recovered. Thus the rate of
change of the quarantined population is expressed in the following equation:
dJ
= ζ3 Is + ξ1 Q − (ρ2 + ν)J.
dt

Recovered population R(t): This subpopulation will increase due to recovery from the disease from
the classes Ia (t), Is (t), Q(t) and J(t) with rates η, ζ2 , ξ2 and ν respectively. Thus the rate of change
of the recovered population is expressed in the following equation:

Interpretation for the parameters involved with the model (1) is summarized in Table 1 for a quick
reference. A schematic diagram for the transmission of disease and progression of the individuals

We have written the basic model with β as constant for the simplicity of forthcoming mathematical calculations. However, for numerical simulations and in order to fit the numerical results with
available data [3], we will consider β = β(t) as a function of time in order to model the effect of
lockdown. In reality the rate of infection is not a constant throughout the epidemic rather it changes
time to time due to variable social behavior. Although it is difficult to obtain actual pattern of variation

2.1

Positivity and boundedness

A viable mathematical model for epidemiology must ensure that the solutions of the model under
consideration remain non-negative once started from an interior point of the positive cone and remains bounded at all future time. The model considered here is not a completely new and several close versions are available in various articles on mathematical epidemiology. However, for
the completeness we just state the relevant result and a brief outline for the proof is provided at
the appendix. For this purpose we consider that the model (1) is subjected to the initial conditions (S(0), E1 (0), E2 (0), Ia (0), Is (0), Q(0), J(0), R(0)) ∈ R8+ , where positive cone of R8 is R8+ =
{(x1 , ..., x8 ) : xi ≥ 0, i = 1, ..., 8}. First we prove that the solution of the system (1) remains within
R8+ at all future time once started from a point within R8+ following the approach outlined in [29].
Theorem 1. The system (1) is invariant in R8+ .
Proof. See appendix.

In order to close the model (1), we can introduce the compartment for number of COVID related
deaths as follows
dD

Now if we write ND = S + E1 + E2 + Ia + Is + Q + J + R + D, then from (1) and (2), we find

With the previous urgument we can prove D(t) ≥ 0 and hence 0 < N = ND implies N is bounded
above, consequently all the constituent variables are also bounded.

Basic and controlled reproduction numbers

In this section, first we find the basic reproduction number for the model (1) in the absence of any
control measure like isolation, quarantine and hospitalization. For this purpose we assume that the
model consists with Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Recovered class only. The Quarantined and
Hospitalized classes are absent. Based upon this assumption we can find the following reduced model:

subjected to non-negative initial conditions S(0), E1 (0), E2 (0), Ia (0), Is (0), R(0) ≥ 0. For this
model N = S + E1 + E2 + Ia + Is + R. Here we calculate the basic reproduction number for
above model following the next generation matrix approached as introduced in [33]. The disease free
equilibrium point is given by (N, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), the derivation of basic reproduction number is based
upon the stability condition of disease free equilibrium point for the model (4). First we rearrange the
compartments of the model (4) such that first m(= 4) equations are related to infected compartments
from epidemiological point of view. Susceptible and recovered compartments will be placed at the
end. From (4), we can write

Here the matrix F1 consists of the terms involved with the appearence of new infection at all the
compartments and V1 contains the terms representing entry and exit of all other individuals, rather

Here the superscript ‘[1]’ stands for the first model considered in this manuscript, that is for the model
(1). This basic reproduction number is the sum of three terms, which represents the number of secondary infections produced by an infectious exposed individual, an asymptomatic infected individual,
and a symptomatic infected individual respectively. βp2NSE2 is the incidence of an exposed individuals
who are at the end of the incubation period and can spread the disease. The number of secondary
infection produced by an individual of E2 compartment in an entirely susceptible population is βp2
per unit of time. An individual spents an average 1δ units of time in E2 compartment. Hence the
number of secondary infection produced by an individual of E2 compartment is βpδ 2 . The number of
secondary infections produced by the individuals of Ia and Is compartments in an entirely susceptible population, per unit of time, are β(1 − σ)p1 and βσ respectively. The average time units spend
by the asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious individuals with their respective compartments are
1

and ρ1 +ζ
. Hence the number of secondary infection produced by the individuals of Ia and Is

comparments are β(1−σ)p

Henceforth we follow the similar notation and approach to calculate other relevant reproduction
numbers without providing much description. Now we calculate the controlled reproduction number
for the model (1).
The model (1) can be written as follows

Final sizes of epidemic

In order to understand the final sizes of the epidemic, we find three impotant quantites Sf , Rf and
Df . First we calculate the final size of the susceptible compartment that is Sf .

Now we assume that the model (1) is subjected to the initial condition that S0 , E10 > 0 and all
other components are absent at the initial time point t = 0. Consequently S0 + E10 = N . Now

Above equation possesses a solution within the interval (0, 1) when Rc > 1 and root of the equation
Φ(x) = 0 gives the final size of the epidemic. On the other hand the question of final size of the

epidemic will not arise in case of Rc ≤ 1 as there is disease growth. This claim can be verified from
the Fig. 2.

3 Mathematical Model - 2
In the following, we have divided the susceptible population (S), Exposed population (cannot spread
infection (E1 ) and can spread infection (E2 )), asymptomatic infective (Ia ) and symptomatic infective
(Is ) of model (1) into two subclasses, namely S1 , S2 , E11 , E21 , E12 , E22 , Ia1 , Ia2 , Is1 , Is2 respectively
based on their classification or behaviour which is directly responsible for the alteration of rate of
disease spread. The classification or division into two different groups may be due to the different age
groups, different implementation of distancing measures, proper and improper use of face mask and
so on. The total population size can be written as N = S1 + S2 + E11 + E21 + E12 + E22 + Ia1 +
Ia2 + Is1 + Is2 + Q + J + R and N is not fixed since deceased compartment is not included in the
model. The assumptions for the extended model formulation are given as follows:
Susceptible population S(t): This subpopulation is divided into two subclasses S1 and S2 . S1 will
decrease after an infection due to the interaction with an symptomatic infected individual (Is1 , Is2 )
with transmission coefficients β11 Is1 , β12 Is2 respectively, asymptomatic infected individual (Ia1 , Ia2 )
with transmission coefficients β11 p11 Ia1 , β12 p21 Ia2 respectively, infectious exposed individual (E12 ,
E22 ) with transmission coefficients β11 p12 E12 , β12 p22 E22 respectively, quarantine (Q) with transmission coefficients βQ Q or hospitalised one (J) with transmission coefficients βJ J. Here β11 , β12 are
rates of infection per unit of time by the symptomatic infected Is1 , Is2 respectively, βQ , βJ are rates
of infection per unit of time by the quarantined and hospitalized population (Q, J) respectively , p11 ,
p12 , p21 and p22 are the reduction factor of infectivity by Ia1 , E12 , Ia2 and E22 respectively compared
to Is1 and Is2 and satisfy the restriction 0 ≤ pij < 1, i, j = 1, 2. S2 will decrease after an infection
due to the interaction with an symptomatic infected individual (Is1 , Is2 ) with transmission coefficients
β21 Is1 , β22 Is2 respectively, asymptomatic infected individual (Ia1 , Ia2 ) with transmission coefficients
β21 p31 Ia1 , β22 p41 Ia2 respectively, infectious exposed individual (E12 , E22 ) with transmission coefficients β21 p32 E12 , β22 p42 E22 respectively, quarantine (Q) with transmission coefficients βQ Q or hospitalised one (J) with transmission coefficients βJ J. Here β21 , β22 are rates of infection per unit of
time by the symptomatic infected Is1 , Is2 respectively, βQ , βJ are rates of infection per unit of time
by the quarantined and hospitalized population (Q, J) respectively , p31 , p32 , p41 and p42 are the reduction factor of infectivity by Ia1 , E12 , Ia2 and E22 respectively compared to Is1 and Is2 and satisfy
the restriction 0 ≤ pij < 1, i = 3, 4, j = 1, 2. The rate of change of the susceptible population is
expressed in the following two equations:
S1
dS1
= − [β11 (Is1 + p11 Ia1 + p12 E12 ) + β12 (Is2 + p21 Ia2 + p22 E22 ) + βQ Q + βJ J] ,

= − [β21 (Is1 + p31 Ia1 + p32 E12 ) + β22 (Is2 + p41 Ia2 + p42 E22 ) + βQ Q + βJ J] .
dt
N
The rate of change of two groups of the exposed compartments, who are not infectious, is described by the follwoing two equations
dE11
S1
=
[β11 (Is1 + p11 Ia1 + p12 E12 ) + β12 (Is2 + p21 Ia2 + p22 E22 ) + βQ Q + βJ J] − µ1 E11 ,

where µ1 and µ2 are the rates at which E11 and E21 progress to the infectious exposed compartments
E12 and E22 respectively. The infectious exposed individuals leave the classes at rates δ1 and δ2

respectively and hence their rate of change with respect to time is given by
dE12
= µ1 E11 − δ1 E12 ,
dt
dE22
= µ2 E21 − δ2 E22 .
dt
The governing equations for the two groups of asymptomatic and symptomatic infected classes
are given as follows:
dIa1
= (1 − σ1 )δ1 E12 − η1 Ia1 ,
dt
dIa2
= (1 − σ2 )δ2 E22 − η2 Ia2 ,
dt
dIs1
= σ1 δ1 E12 − (ρ11 + ζ11 + ζ12 + ζ13 )Is1 ,
dt
dIs2
= σ2 δ2 E22 − (ρ21 + ζ21 + ζ22 + ζ23 )Is2 ,
dt
where the parameters σj , ρj1 , ζj1 , ζj2 and ζj3 (j = 1, 2) have the same interpretation as that of σ, ρ1 ,
ζ1 , ζ2 and ζ3 as described in Table 1 for model (1).
Distinction for quarantined, hospitalized and recovered compartments are not required as first two
groups are under indirect and direct medical interventions. Finally including the governing equations
for quarantined, hospitalized and recovered compartments and using previous equations we get the
final two-group infection model as follows,

Here ρ11 , ρ21 , ξ1 and ρ2 are the disease related death rates for the compartments Is1 , Is2 , Q and J
respectively. A schematic diagram is presented in Fig. 3 without the rate constants in order to avoid
clumsiness.

Figure 3: Schematic diagram for the disease progression described by the model (33). Solid arrows
represent the transfer from one compartment to another while the dotted line with arrow denote the
compartments responsible for disease transmission.
Before analyzing the above model, first we explain how the model (1) can be derived from the
model (33) under suitable assumptions. For this purpose first adding the equations (33e) and (33f),
we find
d
(E12 + E22 ) = (µ1 E11 + µ2 E21 ) − (δ1 E12 + δ2 E22 ).
dt
If we assume µ1 = µ2 = µ and δ1 = δ2 = δ, then we find
d
(E12 + E22 ) = µ(E11 + E21 ) − δ(E12 + E22 ),
dt
which is equation (1c) if we write (E11 + E21 ) = E1 and (E12 + E22 ) = E2 respectively.
Similarly, with the previous assumptions on parameters and variables, and additional assumptions
σ1 = σ2 = σ, η1 = η2 = η and Ia1 + Ia2 = Ia , we can derive (1d) by adding (33g) and (33h). We can
also derive (1e) from the equations (33i) and (33j) using the similar procedure.
Derivation of equation (1a) by adding equations (33a) and (33b) is little bit tricky. Adding (33a)
and (33b), and rearranging the terms, we can write

S1

Further if we assume pj1 = p1 , pj2 = p2 , j = 1, 2, 3, 4, we can write from above equation

above equation as

With the other necessary assumptions on the remaining parameters and variables we can derive the
model (1) from (33). Once the two group of individiuals are non-distinguishable, then the model (1)
results in from the model (33).

The controlled reproduction number is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix F3 V3−1 .

The matrix V3−1 is a lower triangular matrix. Based upon the non-zero entries of F3 , we need the
elements in first two columns of the matrix V3−1 in order to calculate the controlled reproduction

The matrix F3 V3−1 has at most two non-zero eigenvalues and eight zero eigenvalues. The maximum positive eigenvalue of the matrix F3 V3−1 is the controlled reproduction number for the model
(33). As a matter of fact the controlled reproduction number for the model (33) is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix [γij ]2×2 and is given by

where Sj0 and Sjf denote initial and final size of the j-th susceptible class, j = 1, 2. Now we assume
that the model (33) is subjected to the initial conditions such that S10 , S20 , E110 , E210 > 0 and all other
components are absent at the initial time point t = 0. Consequently S10 + S20 + E110 + E210 = N .
Now integrating (33e), (33f) between t = 0 and t = tf and with the assumption that E120 = E220 =
E12f = E22f = 0, we find

Entries of both the matrices P and Q are positive and as they are similar, the spectrum of two matrices

P that is equal to Rc .
The existence of final size of the epidemic depends upon the existence of a point of intersection
between two curves y = φ1 (x) and x = Φ2 (y) within the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1]. Existence of
such point of intersection follows from the Th. 1 in [37]. The two curves y = φ1 (x) and x = Φ2 (y)
[2]
intersect each other at a point (x̄, ȳ), 0 < x̄, ȳ < 1 whenever Rc > 1.

Numerical simulations

In this section we present the numerical simulation results for two models (1) and (33) considered in
this work. First we present the simulation results for the model (1) by fitting the numerical simulation
results with the COVID-19 data for Germany as an example. All the data used in this manuscript are
taken from [3]. In order to ensure that the obtained result and the validity of the model is not country

specific rather it can be matched with the data for other countries. Fitting of the data for Italy, UK and
Spain are provided at the appendix.
The sensitivity of various parameters involved with the model (1) plays an important role behind
numerical simulations. It would be quite lengthy calculations if we want to perform the same for the
model (33) and hence we have restricted ourselves to the first model only. For numerical simulations
and fitting with the data, we have considered the rate of infection as a function of time and hence
some of the estimated parameters do not remain fixed throughout the simulation and hence we have
presented the sensivity indices with respect to the estimated parameter values.

4.1

Sensitivity analysis
[1]

The sensitivity analysis for the endemic threshold (the controlled reproduction number Rc ) in equation (15) tells us how important each parameter is to disease transmission. It is used to understand
[1]
parameters that have a high impact on the threshold Rc and should be targeted by intervention strategies. More precisely, sensitivity indices allows us to measure the relative change in a variable when
a parameter changes. For that purpose, we use the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable
with respect to a given parameter, which is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable
to the relative change in the parameter. If such variable is differentiable with respect to the parameter,
then the sensitivity index is defined as follows.
[1]
The normalized forward sensitivity index of Rc , which is differentiable with respect to a given
parameter θ (say), is defined by
[1]

[1]

ΥθRc =

∂Rc θ
.
∂θ R[1]
c

(78)

From direct calculation and without using the numerical values we can determine the signs of
sensitivity indices with respect to some of the parameters. For the remaining sensitivity indices, we

We use the sensitivity indices to understand parameters that have a high impact on Rc . The
values of the sensitivity indices for different parameters depend on the choice of parameter values.
As we have mentioned earlier, the values of the sensitivity indices can be positive or negative. The
most positive (or negative) value of the sensitivity index for a parameter indicates that parameter is
[1]
most sensitive to Rc and the least positive (or negative) value of the sensitivity index for a parameter
[1]
indicates that parameter is least sensitive to Rc .

independent of any parameter. For example, ΥR
= 1 means that increasing (decreasing)β by a given
β

[1]

percentage increases (decreases) always Rc by that same percentage. The estimation of a sensitive
parameter should be carefully done, since a small perturbation in such parameter leads to relevant
quantitative changes. On the other hand, the estimation of a parameter with a rather small value for
the sensitivity index does not require as much attention to estimate, because a small perturbation in
that parameter leads to small changes. From Table 2, we conclude that the most sensitive parameters
[1]
to the basic reproduction number Rc of the COVID-19 model (1) are β, p1 , p2 , η, σ, δ. In concrete,
an increase of the value of β, p1 , p2 , σ will increase the basic reproduction number by 100%, 33.4%,
[1]
29.69%, 33.21% respectively and an increase of the value of η, δ will decrease Rc by 33.4% and
29.69% respectively. Sensitivity indices with respect to the parameter values as presented in Table 2
can be visualized from Fig. 4.

Simulation results for model - 1

We have fitted the parameters β, p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , µ, δ, σ, η, ρ1 , ξ2 for the range of the values given in
Table 1 and took ζ1 , ζ2 , ζ3 , ξ1 , ρ2 , ν fixed as given in Table 1. We estimated those values for three
different time intervals (1-30 th day, 31-42 nd day, 43-95 th day). We have considered the initial
values of the parameters as given in Table 2. We have chosen the time interval and end values of
different compartments from the fittings over the previous time intervals.
The optimization of parameters to describe the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany was fitted by
minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), in such a way that the solutions obtained by the model
approximate the reported cumulative number of infected cases. We applied three searches to minimize the SSE function: by using a gradient-based method first, followed by a step of minimization
with a gradient-free method, again followed by a third step of gradient-based method. MATLAB
based nonlinear least-square solver fmincon and patternsearch are used to fit simulated and observed
daywise cumulative number of infected cases for three different time intervals. Detailed description
of this method and its implementation can be found in [32, 38–40].
The model (1) is simulated with best fitted parameter values as mentioned above and the simulation result against the daily reported data and cumulative data are presented in Fig. 5a. In this case the

values of β are constants over three different range of days starting from the initial date of COVID-19
epidemic spread in Germany. For this figure some of the parameters are estimated as described above.
Another simulation result is presented in Fig. 5b where initially the value of β is constant for several
days, and then monotone decreasing over a range of days and then remain constant for the rest of the
period. The variation of β with respect to time is shown in Fig. 6. Interestingly the data are fitted
well in the case of time varying β where β(t) is continuous. For the simulation result presented in
Fig. 5b, the number of days for which β(t) remains constant and then start decaying are adjusted in
such a way that the outcome matches well with both the cumulative and daily data. Accordingly the
slope of decaying β(t), the day up to which it decays and the lower value of β(t) are chosen. The
numerical simulation and fitting with the data is carried out with the objective that the simulation result should be pretty close to the cumulative number of reported cases. We can claim that our attempt
is successful as the cumulative number of reported cases for Germany on 15th May, 2020 obtained
from the simulation is 180,788 and the reported data (see [3]) shows it is equal to 182,250. In this
case the choice of β(t) is as shown in Fig. 6a. Cumulative number of reported cases obtained from
the simulation with the β(t) as shown in Fig. 6b is equal to 180,808. Both the simulated values are
close to the reported data. Relative percentage error is less that 1% and is precisely equal to 0.79%.

present work. It is important to mention that the number of intervals over which we have to take
different values of β is not always limited to three as in the case of Germany. The number of intervals
over which we need to choose different values of β in order to match the simulation results with the
data from different countries varies significantly. Of course, in all such simuations the values of β
are decreasing with respect to the number of days. The simulations results for three more countries,
namely Italy, UK and Spain, are provided in the appendix along with the result for Germany again
where the 95% confidence intervals are shown. The parameter values used, the range of days over
which β remains constant and estimated parameter values are also provided at the appendix.

Simulation results for model - 2

In order to understand the usefullness of the model (33), we now present some numerical simulation
results. In Fig. 5 we have presented the simulation results for the model (1) up to 19th of May. For
the fitting with data, we have obtained three different values of β as β1 = 3.98, β2 = 1.77 and
β3 = 1.05. The partial lockdown was started at Germany on 13th March, 2020 and then went into
complete lock lockdown step by step. The process of unlocking at the essential sectors were started
from 15th of May, 2020 and by that time the spreading speed of COVID-19 was much reduced. There
are several restrictions like using mask, maitaining social distances and many other restrictions are in
place in order to prevent the further spread of the disease. As of now the disease is not completely
eradicated rather a minor number of cases are getting reported on a regular basis but the situation is
under control.
We are interested to see the situation if all the citizens do not follow the suggested restrictions then
what can happen afterward. For this purpose we now perform an interesting numerical simulations.
We have simulation results for the model (1) as described at the previous subsection up to 19th of
May. Now we start simulating the model (33) from the day immediately after 19th May and continue
up to the end of November 2020. We assume that a fraction of population are not following the
guideline and other fraction is following the safety and preventive norms appropriately. Let us define
the “coefficient of social interactions” as S1 /N and is denoted by K. If we assume that the 10% of
the population is not following the norm then S1 /N ≡ K = 0.1 and hence S2 /N = 0.9 = 1 − K. We
assume that β11 = β1 , β22 = β3 and β12 = β21 = (β1 + β3 )/2 where βj (j = 1, 2, 3) are the values
determined by fitting the data with the first model. Initial densities of E11 and E21 can be distributed
with the same proportion to K and 1 − K of the value of E1 on 19th May. Same procedure is adopted
for other components except Q, J and R. For simplicity we also assume that the other parameters
involved with the two group model are equal to the values of the corresponding parameter involved
with the model (1) and is equal to the numerical values as mentioned at the last column of Table 3.
For clearer understanding we can mention here some of the parameter values: pj1 = p1 = 0.34
(j = 1, 2, 3, 4), σ1 = σ2 = σ = 0.1 and so on.
With above choice of initial values and parameter values now we simulate the model (33) up to
the end of November, 2020. Two different simulations are performed and the simulation results are
presented in Fig. 8. For first simulation we have considered K = 0.1 fixed up to the end of November
2020 (see Fig. 8a). Second simulation is performed for K = 0.1 upto the end of August and then
K = 0.15 during September to November 2020. In the figure we have ploted the consolidated
compartments E1 , E2 , Ia and Is in order to avoid any confusion where we have obtained the values of
these compartments by adding the values of the respective compartments in two group. To be specific,
E1 = E11 + E12 and similary for other compartments. A relatively small increase of K lead to an
essential acceleration in the disease progression.
With the parameter setup mentioned above one can calculate the controlled reproduction number
[2]
Rc using the detailed formula given in Sub-section 3.1. Without any loss of generality we can make

a crude assumption that NN1 = K in order to find a value of Rc . Clearly the measure for NN2 will
be 1 − K. With K = 0.1, we can see slow growth in exposed and infected compartments as shown
[2]
in Fig. 8a as we find Rc = 1.089. Now if we change the value of K to K = 0.15 the revised
[2]
[2]
measure of Rc becomes Rc = 1.219. These results ensure the usefulness of our model along with
the mathematical details and supportive numerical simulations.

Model with relapse

Most of the important features and several issues related to COVID-19 remain unclear and immense
scientific efforts are required to understand various important issues. As it is reported at many sources
that some of the recovered individuals can become infected after a certain period of time as the recovery is seems to be temporary. In this section we want to revisit the model (1) with the modification
that a fraction of recovered population can return back to the susceptible class. We are mainly interested to calculate the final size of the infected compartment due to fact that the recovered individuals
join the susceptible class after a certain number of days. In order to find a rough estimate of the size
of the infected compartment and to obtain their estimate explicitly we can make a crude assumption.
The assumption is that the disease related death rate is negligible. With these assumptions the model
(1) with relapse of the disease can be written as follows

In order to come up with a closed form of estimate for the endemic steady-state in case of relapse
of the disease, we have assumed that the number of COVID-19 related death is negligible. In reality
this is not true however it help us to have a rough estimate for the endemic steady-state dependning
upon the value of . The parameter  is related to the relapse rate as 1 is the average number of days

for which B1 is less than one in order to have a feasible values for the components of endemic
equilibrium point in case of replase. In order to have a feasible values of I¯s and other components
we should have B1 > 1. Interestingly, with the parameter values mentioned at the last column of

have an admissible value of B1 , if we consider β = 1.2 and with other parameter values are same

as in the third column of Table 3 we find B1 = 0.98 although Rc remains less than one. Finally

A wide range of mathematical approaches are adopted to develop viable mathematical model to understand the propagation of disease spread for COVID-19. The proposed mathematical models are
not only diffierent in the context of basic assumptions behind the model formulation, rather incomplete or unclear understanding of disease spread for COVID-19 is another burden. In this paper we
have proposed and analyzed an ordinary differential equation model to study the COVID-19 disease
propagation which consists of fundamentally six compartments. The basic compartments are susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, hospitalised and recovered. It is evident that all the exposed
individuals can not spread the disease and hence the exposed compartment is divided into two subcompartments E1 and E2 where the individuals belonging to the second compartment can infect the
healthy individuals. Once the incubation period is over, exposed individuals are becoming actively
infected which means they can infect other individuals. In case of COVID-19 disease, every infected
individuals are not developing appropriate symptoms and asymptomatic individuals can recovered
from the disease without any serious medical intervention. The infected compartment is divided into
two namely asymptomatic infected and symptomatic infected.
There is significant variation in the collection and reporting of infected data and no uniformity
is maintained so far due to the rapid spread of the disease. From huge dataset, it is quite difficult to
understand when an individual is identified as a COVID-patient but at which category he belongs to
(whether an individual belongs to E1 , E2 , Ia or Is compartment). Without any loss of generality we
can assume that the individuals belonging to Ia and Is are tested to be positive. Once an individual is
tested to be positive, he/she needs to follow the appropriate guideline of the country and hence they
will be under isolation or quarantine assuming that they do not need any medical intervention through
hospitalization. Hence we have assumed that the individuals from Ia compartment directly move to
the recovered compartment and hospitalization is required for certain fraction of individuals belonging
to sysmptomatic infected and quarantined compartments. COVID-19 related death is assumed for the
Is and J compartments only. As the quarantined individuals are monitored on a regular basis and
the healthcare service is supposed to be effective, hence every needy individuals can be moved to
the hospital as per requirement. Based upon these assumptions we have considered two models here,
epidemic model (1) and two group epidemic model (33). Interesting and significant contribution of
our work is the consideration of time dependent rate of infection over various periods of time. This
variation is adopted into the model in order to capture the effect of lockdown, social distancing etc.
which plays a crucial role to reduce the disease spread. The date of implementation of lockdown and
the extent of lockdown varies from one country to another. Total lockdown is rarely implemented

rather most of the European countries went to step-by-step lockdown and sometimes they imposed
complete lockdown at some states and/or provinces instead of total lockdown accross the country.
In this present work we have considered different ranges of days over which the rate of infection
varies in order to match the simulation results with the cumulative number of reported infected individuals for four countries. The magnitudes of β(t) over various intervals are obtained through fitting
the simulated result with data but the choice of different periods remain in our hand. One can argue
that the obtained results might change with a variant assumption but at the same time we can claim
the appropriate nature of varying infectivity is not much clear yet. In order to show the effectiveness
of our analysis, the fitting is done for the data from four different countries. It is important to mention
here that the fitting with daily data seems to be are not in good agreement (we can see significant
variation around the fitted curve) but at the same time we need to keep in mind the irregularity of the
reporting protocol. It is a matter of fact that several contries have changed their reporting mechanism
time to time alongwith the change in the process of testing. A natural question may arise that we
are considering constant β(t) over different time intervals, so what will be the outcome if we match
the simulation result with the daily data or 7 days moving average? Answer is that either we need to
change β(t) in daily basis which is not a good idea for fitting the simulation results of ordinary differential equation models with the data or we can observe a significant disagreement with the cumulative
number of reported cases. For numerical simulation of the model (1) we have obtained three different
values of β and we can calculate the controlled basic reproduction numbers accordingly. For the set
of parameter values as mentioned in the three columns of Table 3, we can calculate the controlled
[1]
reproduction numbers as Rc = 2.9565, 1.2847, 0.7002. In Section 2 we have calculated the basic
[1]
reproduction number R0 , for model (1), apart from the controlled reproduction number Rc . If we
[1]
calculate the basic reproduction number R0 for model (1) with the parameter values given in the first
[1]
[1]
column of Table 3, we find R0 = 3.888 which is quite higher than Rc . It clearly indicates that the
disease can propagate much faster in the absence of the control measures.
The proposed two group epidemic model can capture the situation when one group of people are
following the social distancing norm, using face mask appropriately and other group is not obeying
the safety norms. We must admit that the data and relevant information for the parameter values
involved with the model (33) are not available yet. But the numerical simulation shows that is 10%
or more of the population start violating the safety norms then there is a resonable chance that the
disease can relapse. It is difficult to predict the size of the next epidemic but our model is capable to
capture the realistic scenario. The number of daily reported cases started increasing at some countries
like Iran, Spain etc. (see the data avialbale at [3]) compared to the number of reported infections on
the days close the end of complete lockdown.
The coefficient of social interaction K introduced in Section 4.3 characterizes the intensity of
the interaction between susceptible and infectious individuals, and it determines the rate of disease
progression. The value K = 0 corresponds to complete lockdown, and K = 1 to the absence of
lockdown. Partial measures of social distancing after the end of lockdown in a number of European
countries restrain its value to K ≈ 0.1 characterized by a slow growth of the number of infected
individuals. Even a slight increase of this coefficient up to K = 0.15, which can be expected in
September due to the end of vacation season and the beginning of academic year, can lead to an
important burst of epidemic.
We have calculated the maximum size of the epidemic for both the models considered in this
manuscript and obtained a rough estimate for the endemic steady-state analytically. The maximum
size of the epidemic are calculated assuming β is constant however the numerical simulations are carried out for non-constant β and their variation with time is already explained clearly. Here we justify
the analytical findings with supportive numerical results and argue for the effectivity of lockdown and
imposition of several social restrictions. We mentioned above that the controlled reproduction number

for Germany is Rc = 2.9565 with β = β1 = 3.98. With this value of Rc , solving the equation (26)
we find x = 0.06303. With the current population size of Germany which is approximately equal to
82.9 million gives us final size as Sf = 5, 225, 187. This result clearly indicates that a huge number
of people could be infected if no such restriction was imposed. Similar calculations can be done for
other compartments as well for two group model also. But we skip them here for the sake of brevity
and will address this issue in our future endevour with appropriate estimates for the values of other
parameters involved with the second model.

The inequalities mentioned above hold for any point belonging to the interior of R8+ or on the
boundary hyper-planes. Solutions starting from a non-negative initial condition and non-negativity of
the time derivaties imply that the system (1) is invariant in R8+ .

Appendix – B
Here we present the numerical simulation results and fitting with the data alongwith the 95% confidence intervals for Germany, Italy, Spain and UK. The data used for these fiiting are available at [3].
The model (1) is used to perform the simulations and fitting with data. Parameterization are also the
same as we have explained in Table 1. Details of the parameter values and their estimates for Germany
are provided in Table 3. Parameter values and and their estimates for rest of the countries are provided below. It is worthy to mention here that the values of β(t) are estimated over requisite number
of intervals in order to have a good fit with the cumulative reported number of infected individuals.
As a result the number of intervals over which β(t) is changing its constant magnitude varies from
one country to another. In case of Germany, the number of intervals over which β(t) takes different
constant values are three whereas the number of intervals for β(t) is five when we considered the
data for Italy. Also the number days over which the simulations are carried out is not unique as the
date implementation of lockdown and its partial withdrawal varies from one country to another. For
all the countries, we have started the simulation from the date 15th of February, 2020 and continued
approximately up to the end of strict lockdown restrictions.
