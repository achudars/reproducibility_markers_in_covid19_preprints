Key Points

Question: What are the expected impacts of post Covid-19 unemployment on excess
suicide and premature death.

Findings: A risk assessment applying pooled summary risk estimates from metaanalyses of observational studies predicts approximately 9,700 excess annual deaths from
suicide and 66,000 annual deaths from all causes among those recently unemployed due
to Covid-19.

Meaning: Indirect health impacts of societal responses to Covid-19 are identifiable,
multiple and quantifiable.

Abstract
Importance: The Covid-19 pandemic has driven behavioral and governmental
responses with large impacts on economic activity. Estimates of indirect health effects of
economic impacts may inform societal action.

Objective: To estimate the size of the impact of Covid-19 unemployment on suicides
and deaths from all causes.

Design: Risk assessment applying of pooled effects hazard ratios from published metaanalyses of observational epidemiological studies, post-Covid-19 unemployment, current
labor force composition data, and current age-adjusted mortality rates.

Results: This risk assessment estimates approximately 9,700 excess annual deaths from
suicide and 66,000 annual deaths from all causes among those recently unemployed due
to Covid-19.

Conclusions and Relevance: Indirect health impacts of societal responses to Covid19 are identifiable, multiple and quantifiable. Adverse health impacts, such as those from
unemployment, may endure longer than those of the Covid-19 pandemic itself. Decisionmakers can include indirect health impacts in policy-making calculi for Covid-19
mitigation and suppression strategies.

Introduction

To limit death and mitigate demand on health care systems from the transmission of
Covid-19 governments employed rarely used policies to limit mobility and economic
activity, including travel restrictions, bans on gathering, and community-wide stay-athome rules. Uncertainty and health threat required rapid decisions based on non-peer
reviewed predictive models and without an explicit trade-offs analysis. (1)

Behavioral responses to Covid-19 re-enforced by governmental social distancing rules
have resulted in a number of secondary consequence, business closures, unemployment,
bankruptcies, and delayed health care, fear and anxiety, and suicide crisis line calls.

Available risk assessment tools applied to some of these indirect impacts might quantify
secondary health effects of these impacts. (2,3) Weighing such indirect health impacts
might contribute to balancing responses to control Covid-19 with other health aims and
may inform the nature, scope, and adoption of policy countermeasures, such as income
supports and expansion of health and mental health services.

Between the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and May 14th, 2020, over 36 million
Americans had filed unemployment claims. A review of studies conducted following the
great recession of 2007 found that unemployment may contribute to hunger, the loss of
housing, declines in birth weigh, increased symptom reporting, substance abuse,
disability, medication use, and hospital visits, and untimely deaths due to suicide.

(4) Meta-analyses have produced summary risks estimates of the effect of unemployment
on several health outcomes. This analysis predicts the impact of Covid-19 unemployment
on suicide and all cause mortality using these estimates.

Methodology

Data on weekly unemployment claims came from the US Department of Labor. (5) Data
on the age composition of the current labor force in 2019 came from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. (6) Data on all cause age specific death rates and age-adjusted suicide rates
came from the National Bureau of Health Statistics. (7) The analysis used the average of
the gender specific rates.

Estimates of suicide risk attributable to unemployment came from a meta-analysis of 16
studies. (8) Studies included in the meta-analysis were published after 1980, had a
longitudinal cohort design, included data on duration of unemployment. Included studies
came from Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, which are all countries with strong social
safety nets and longitudinal employment and mortality registers. The overall pooled
relative risk of suicide associated with long-term unemployment (average follow-up time
7.8 years) compared to those currently employed was 1.70 (95% CI 1.22 to 2.18). The
authors found non-linear effects with the suicide hazard greater for unemployment < 5
years versus >5 years. Predictions applied in this analysis use estimates based on the 1-5
year follow up period (2.50; 95% CI 1.83 to 3.17). The publication did not provide
gender and age specific risk estimates.

Estimates of age-specific excess all-cause mortality risk due to unemployment came from
a published meta-analysis of 40 studies. (9) Studies were published between 1980 and
2008, came primarily from OECD countries, involved 20 million people, were of
observational designs and had longitudinal follow up for up to 10 years. Overall pooled
estimates of the hazard ratio in unemployed working aged people relative to the entire
population were 1.63 (95% CI 1.49 to 1.79). This estimate represents the average effect
over 10 years adjusted for age and other covariates, which varied by study. Estimates
used for this analysis were age-group specific and adjusted for health risk covariates. The
authors also estimated pooled hazard ratios stratified by duration of follow up but did not
publish separate estimates for age and duration.

Results

Applying age-specific hazard ratios from Milner et al. (2013) to the newly unemployed
population distributed based on the composition of the current labor force and agespecific suicide rates, produces the results in the table below (Table 1). The central
estimate based on the current number of the newly unemployed in the US population is
approximately 9700 excess suicide deaths per year.

Applying age-specific hazard ratios from Roelfs et al. (2011) to the newly unemployed
population distributed based on the composition of the current labor force and age
specific death rates, produces the results in the table below (Table 2). The central

estimate based on the current number of the newly unemployed in the US population is
approximately 66,000 excess deaths per year.

Discussion

This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of quantifying indirect health impacts of
societal responses to Covid-19. The risk assessment methodology, though simple,
provides an evidence-based prediction of the impact of current unemployment since
Covid-19 on excess suicide and pre-mature death.

This analysis is not a full accounting of all of the health impacts of either unemployment
or the overall Covid-19 response. The choice of unemployment as a measure of health
exposure and all-cause and suicide mortality as the measures of outcome is based on data
availability. Unemployment is an earl indicator of the economic effects of Covid-19
responses. The consequences of unemployment on mortality and suicide are well studied
and the subject of published meta-analyses. Further analyses may predict impact on
unemployment on other outcomes, including health symptoms, disease conditions, and
biological markers. (10-12)

The estimates have acknowledged uncertainties. For example, unemployment following
Covid-19 may be short lived or prolonged. Some share of the predicted health effects
might be mitigated by national policy countermeasures. Notably, most studies included
the meta-analyses occurred in countries where social safety nets are robust.

Other economic effects, including the loss of income and health insurance, which are also
associated with increased mortality, typically accompany unemployment. The effects of
poverty on mortality are consistent across well designed longitudinal cohort studies. In
the lower third of the income distribution each additional $10 000 of income reduces
mortality risk by >50%. (13) Lack of health insurance is an independent predictor of
mortality with smaller but consistent and statistically significant effects. (14) Given
limited data on income and insurance effects and in the interest of not double counting
impacts, these effects are not estimated separately.

Others have observed that overall mortality rates decline during economic downturns due
to declines in traffic and possibly improvement in behavioral risk factors. Health impacts
due to unemployment are distinct from and are experienced by a different group from the
general population. How trade-offs are made between population benefits of economic
decline and those directly impacted, such as the unemployed, is an important ethical
question.

Accounting for the health benefits and costs of Covid-19 responses are important for
optimizing public health. (15) In places where Covid-19 response has led to significant
economic and social disruption, policy leaders might develop indicators and tools to
monitor these effects. Longer-term income support, universal health insurance
coverage and other policy interventions may be warranted to mitigate the indirect health
impacts of Covid-19 response.
