Abstract
In this paper, we propose an enhanced SEIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious
-Recovered-Death) model with time varying case fatality and transmission rates for
confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. We show that when case fatalities and
transmission rates are represented by simple Sigmoid functions, historical cases and
fatalities can be fit with a relative-root-mean-squared-error accuracy on the order of 2%
for most American states over the period from initial cases to July 28 (2020). We find
that the model is most accurate for states that so far had not shown signs of multiple
waves of the disease (such as New York), and least accurate for states where
transmission rates increased after initially declining (such as Hawaii). For such states,
we propose an alternate multi-phase model. Both the base model and multi-phase
model provide a way to explain historical reported cases and deaths with a small set of
parameters, which in the future can enable analyses of uncertainty and variations in
disease progression across regions.

Introduction

1

COVID-19 has challenged the world to react to a new contagious virus in the absence of
effective medical treatment and vaccines. Over the course of nine months from the
outbreak in December 2019, when the first cases were confirmed in Wuhan, China, until
April 24th 2020, 213 countries and territories reported nearly 28 million confirmed cases
and a death toll exceeding 900,000 persons [1]. In the meantime, waiting for effective
clinical care and vaccination, countries have reacted to the pandemic by controlling
travel, implementing large-scale quarantine and restricting gatherings and contact
among people, as well as requiring hygiene measures and screening for possible cases.
Based on recent findings, compared to the global SARS epidemic in 2002 and MERS
in 2012, COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period, with a mean time of 5
days [2]. COVID-19 has also been found to be transmissible while individuals are
asymptomatic. Meanwhile, disease severity is widely variable, depending on age,
comorbidities, baseline health and access to care. Even those with mild or no symptoms,
who are often young adults, may still transmit the disease to others. These factors,
combined with limited testing and inconsistency in adherence to public health measures,
have made the virus hard to contain. Policy makers are also facing a dilemma,
balancing the goal of maintaining economic activity against saving lives through strict

measures, while at the same time learning about the effectiveness of interventions and
the nature of the disease.
In this paper, we seek to improve understanding of the dynamics of how COVID-19
is spread, utilizing a variation of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Death
(SEIRD) model. Our key innovation is representation of the transmission rate and case
fatality rate as continuously varying functions, which are optimally fit to historical data
on confirmed cases and deaths. We surmise that neither parameter is static, as they are
influenced by the enactment and adherence to public health measures and medical care,
neither of which is constant over time. We have applied our model to all 50 American
states to derive insights into how the disease has spread in different localities, which are
influenced by population health, disease exposure, localized public health interventions
and messaging, in addition to other place specific factors.

Prior research on COVID-19 has estimated disease-specific parameters, such as the
basic reproduction number and latent period [3–5], demonstrating why the disease is
highly transmissible. Mathematical models have also been used to analyze different
transmission scenarios, to inform policy makers as to possible futures and the effects of
interventions. For example, according to a statistical guideline model published in
2005 [6], the state of New York reacted to the urgent shortage of ventilators by
requesting more ventilators from the federal government and implementing new
interventions, such as closures of schools and restaurants [7].
Another use of disease transmission models has been to predict and plan for future
demands on the health care system, such as demands for hospital beds (ICU in
particular) and needs for health care resources, such as ventilators. Toward that
goal, [8] provides a statistical model of death data to predict future fatalities, assuming
that social distancing measures are maintained. From the projected fatality data, they
estimated hospital utilization with an individual-level microsimulation model based on
the historical statistics of age-specific ICU admission. [9] simulates the COVID-19
outbreak, parameterized with the US population demographics, with a compartmental
model under different scenarios of self-isolation, projecting hospital utilization and
recognizing the mitigation effect of self-isolation on hospital capacity.
Due to the limits of testing methods, the long incubation period, and cases with
mild or no symptoms and delayed reporting, there is potentially a huge (and unknown)
number of unreported cases, the extent to which could affect the future evolution of the
epidemic. Some researchers, therefore, have used the SIR (symptomatic-infectious
-recovered) model and SEIRD to estimate the number of undetected cases [10] and [11].
Some approaches also incorporate transportation information (such as human migration
data and community mobility data) to analyze the impact of travel on disease
transmission and thus the effect of travel restriction [12–14]. However, most studies
using SEIRD or SIR assume the transmission rate and death rate to be constant over
time. With improvement in clinical treatment and changing intervention policies, the
transmission rate and fatality rate will be time variable. Therefore, SEIRD models with
constant parameters cannot accurately depict the spread of disease. [15] and [16] both
consider time dependency of transmission parameters. Godio et al modify the new
recovery rate to a sinusoidal function and they adjust the transmission rate according to
mobility trends [15]. Piccolomini et al. compare two piecewise time-dependent infection
rate functions and fit the infection rate function, incubation rate, and death rate for
each uniformly divided time interval [16]. These approaches require introduction of
many parameters to depict time dependency, thus risking overfitting and reducing
model generality.

In our research we explore use of a concise formulation through which continuously
time varying transmission and case fatality rates are modeled with a small number of
parameters, which are fit to historical data. Like [7], we utilize a type of logistic
function (i.e., a Sigmoid function), but not simply to model reported deaths over time,
but to instead model transmission rate and case fatality rate within the SEIRD model.
Our objective is to improve the classical SEIRD model through an approach that adapts
to the dynamic pattern of transmission under different epidemic scenarios. Thus, we
provide insights into transmissibility of the disease while modeling historical data on
confirmed cases and confirmed deaths.

The Proposed Time Varying Model

We draw from the SEIRD compartmental model, which divides the population into five
groups: susceptible(S), exposed(E), infected(I), recovered(R) and dead(D). SEIRD
utilizes differential equations to model the evolution of the number of people in these
states over time. Susceptible individuals can catch the virus through contact with
infectious people and turn into the state of exposed. Exposed people are in a latent
state and then progress to the infectious state with a rate inversely related to the
incubation period (thus, exposed is defined as a state in which people are not yet
infectious). Infected people eventually progress into either the dead state, if they
succumb to the disease, or the recovered state, with different rates. Those who have
recovered are assumed to be no longer susceptible to contracting the disease.
We introduce death rate α (t) as a time varying function, representing the
proportion of infectious individuals who eventually die from the disease, by date. Those
who eventually die transfer from the infected to the died state at a rate of ρ,
representing the inverse of the time from becoming infectious until time of death. In our
model, ρ is assumed to be constant over time. Those who eventually recover do so at
the γ, representing the inverse of the time from becoming infectious until recovery. We
will also later derive the effective reproduction number Rep (t), representing the average
number of persons who are exposed to the disease by each infectious person, as a
function of time.
Taking these factors into account, the system of equations of the proposed SEIRD
model is given by::

Changes in intervention policy, global events and medical care affect α (t) and β (t).
While, in theory, these functions may change erratically as a consequence of discrete
events, such as new public health measures, we hypothesize that such discrete events do
not suddenly alter either function. Therefore, we seek to understand whether a simple
continuous model, with a minimal set of parameters, might accurately represent
historical data. For illustration, at the enactment of a new intervention policy, the
public may not react immediately, and neither do the transmission parameters. The
public will get used to the policy after a period of adaptation, and eventually the
effective reproduction number will stabilize. In addition, the public responds to both
government policies and communication about the disease. Communication comes from
many, sometimes conflicting, sources. How the public at large absorbs and responds to
such often confusing messages may be gradual.
A natural function to describe this pattern of change is the Sigmoid function.
Equation 2 is the general form of the Sigmoid function, where k determines the slope of
the function and a determines the x value at the middle point (i.e., point of time when
y = .5). A standard Sigmoid function with k = 1 and a = 0 is shown in Figure 1.

Parameter Estimation and Model Fitting

137

Parameters in Eqs. 1 were estimated with the objective of minimizing the weighted
summation of squared error between cumulative predicted and measured confirmed
cases and the summation of squared error between cumulative predicted and cumulative
confirmed deaths. Our analysis is based on the period from the day of first reported
case in each state until 07/28/2020, across all 50 American states. For each state of the
USA, we chose a start date of 4 days prior to the date of the first confirmed case. Four
days was chosen based on a report by CDC [17], indicating the median incubation
period is 4 days, ranging from 2 - 7 days.
Two methods were used for different sets of parameters, as described below. To
estimate the shape parameters m, n, a, b and the starting/ending parameters
βstart , βend , αstart , αend , we fit Eqs. 1 to the cumulative confirmed case numbers and
the cumulative confirmed death numbers with the nonlinear least square method. Other
parameters were derived from prior research.

As mentioned in the CDC reports [17–19], the median incubation period is 4 days,
ranging from 2 - 7. Among 305 hospitalized patients and 10,647 recorded deaths, the
median time of hospitalization was 8.5 days and the median interval from illness onset
to death was 10 days (IQR = 6 - 15 days). We assume the median hospitalization time
is the median time for infectious people to stop being contagious. Hence, we set these
parameters as the reciprocal of these time values: σ = 1/4, γ = 1/8.5, ρ = 1/10.

The remaining parameters are derived for each American state by optimizing the fit of
the model to historical case and death data, where the objective is to minimize a
weighted sum of daily squared error over the analysis period. We utilized a search
algorithm that required initialization and a constrained search space, as explained below.
We define the model function M (t; [βstart , βend , m, a, αstart , αend , n, b]) : t → R2 ,
where M (t; [βstart , βend , m, a, αstart , αend , n, b]) = [Iˆ (t) + R̂ (t) + D̂ (t) , D̂ (t)] and the
reported case number and death number at time t is [Cases(t), Deaths(t)].
Because it is unlikely for transmission and death rates to change drastically in a
single day, we set upper bounds for m and n at 0.33 (meaning that rates do not
suddenly change in less than three days) and initialize the search at 0.25. We permit
the turning point of the sigmoid function to occur on any day in the timeline; we set
a, b ∈ [0, 125], where 125 is the length of the period from March 1st to July 28th , in days

(as of March 1st few states had reported cases). Prior research suggests that the initial
effective reproduction number is around 3 [5], equivalent to a transmission rate of 0.75,
which we use for initialization. Because transmission rates vary significantly among
locations due to local conditions (such as crowding), we bound βstart ∈ [0.5, 7.5] and
βend ∈ [0, 2.5], thus permitting a wide range of results.
To summarize, the parameters set P = [βstart , βend , m, a, αstart , αend , n, b] is
initialized as [0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 10, 0.4, 0.1, 0.25, 10]. Then the parameter optimization
problem is:

The number of reported deaths is smaller than the number of reported cases in all
locations. Thus, treating errors in death estimation and case estimation the same will
lead to underfitting of the death data, in preference to minimizing the errors in case
data. Therefore, considering the accuracy of the reported death data and the fitting
accuracy, we optimized a weighted sum of squared death and case data, multiplying w
by deaths during the fitting process. The adjusted objective function is:

The parameters are estimated by solving the nonlinear constrained least-squares
problem in Eqs. 6, utilizing the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA). The LMA
algorithm adaptively varies the parameter updates between the gradient descent update
and the Gauss-Newton update and accelerates to a local minimum [20]. The LMA is
implemented to our model fitting by the lmfit package in Python. In our analysis we
utilized w = 20 , to yield similar error percentages for deaths and cases.

Data Limitations

191

We recognize that reported data are not the same as actual cases and actual deaths,
which are unknowable. Daily confirmed cases are influenced by widely varying testing
rates and policies, which change over time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the
limited test kits were restricted to those who suffer from severe symptoms and those
who are in a higher risk of exposure. Death data are likely to be more accurate, but
they too can suffer from reporting errors, due to how deaths are attributed to
COVID-19 (or not), the timing of filing reports and the general accuracy of reporting.
For these reasons, our model represents estimation of reported data rather than the
actual (but unknown) number of cases and number of deaths.
Reporting has also shown a consistent day-of-week variation across many locations,
with weekend data differing from weekday data. This variation is more likely the
consequence of different patterns of healthcare staffing, and differences in how patients
present for testing by day of week, rather than differences in disease transmission by day
of week. To smooth out these effects, we model the moving 7-day average data instead
of the daily reported data

The first case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported on January 20, 2020 [21].
As of July 28, 2020, a total of 4,459,2869 cases and 151,711 deaths had been reported
across the states and territories of America [22]. We fit the model with the dataset of
7-day moving average cases and deaths for the 50 states, provided by the COVID-19
tracking project lead by The Atlantic (derived from the Center for Disease Control), for
the period from the date of the first reported cases to July 28th . The fitting accuracy
across all states is presented in Figure 2, measured by the relative root mean square

Figure 3 and 4 show the specific fitting results for cases and deaths by day for the
two states with the largest number of cases (New York and California) as well as two
other states for which the fit is less accurate (Florida and Hawaii). For New York and
California, the fitting results almost coincide with the CDC data. Examining Florida
and Hawaii, the CDC data follows a pattern of two phases, which is not as well
captured by our model. Especially for Hawaii, the curve flattened for a period and then
rose. As discussed later, our model characterizes the transmission dynamic for a period
with one phase, i.e. the curve should become flat at most once.

Effective Reproduction Number Calculation and Trends

233

Effective reproduction number at any time t, which we define as Rep (t), is the average
number of people in a population who are infected per infectious case, where everyone is
susceptible to the disease. Rep (t) measures the transmission potential of infectious
diseases [23]. When Rep (t) > 1, the rate of new cases will increase over time, until the
population loses susceptibility to the disease. When Rep (t) < 1, the rate of new cases
will decline over time.
Rep (t) can be estimated with the next generation matrix method [24]. We define X
as the vector of infected class (i.e. E, I) and Y as the vector of uninfected class (i.e. S,
R, D). Let dX
dt = F (X, Y ) − V (X, Y ), where F (X, Y ) is the vector of new infection
rates (flows from Y to X) and V (X, Y ) is the vector of all other rates. Then for our
model, the next generation matrix is expressed as

At the beginning of the epidemic, Rep (t) reflects the natural transmissibility of
COVID-19, i.e. the basic reproduction number R0 in the absence of intervention. With
the evolution of the epidemic, Rep (t) changes dynamically, as do the transmission rate
β (t) and death rate α (t), which are influenced by both the intervention policy and
population immunity. Figures 5 and 6 show the fitted Rep (t) at the start of the
epidemic across all states and fitted Rep (t) on July 28th . We see that Rep (t) ranges
from 1.27 to 16.49, with a median value of 2.87. It should be kept in mind that this
optimal fit is a reflection of the reported data on cases. Increasingly aggressive testing
may make it appear that Rep (t) grows faster than the actual (unknown) number of
cases.

As noted, in the early stages of an epidemic, the reproduction number may seem
particularly large not only because the disease spreads rapidly but also because the rate
of testing is increasing. In this sense, the estimated reproduction number is a reflection
of both changes in the data collection process and the actual spread of disease.

Death Rate Trends

Death rate is another measure that shows the change in virus outcomes over time,
reflecting the health system’s ability to deal with the flood of infected people. Figure 8
provides examples. From the historical plot, we see the hardest-hit states, like New
York and Florida, experienced a much higher death rate in the early stage than the
average 3% death rate in the United States. The relatively high death rate could be

caused by the lack of effective medical treatment and hospital overload. It could also
reflect limited testing of patients, whereby only the sickest patients were recorded as
cases. With improvement of medical treatment, and perhaps increased testing, the
death rate per confirmed case for most states decreased to a stable value.

Multi-Phase Model

275

Our model as presented fits reported data for cases and deaths within 2% error in most
states. However, because it is premised on the assumption that transmission rates do
not at first go down, and then later go up, it needs to be modified for states that exhibit
multiple waves of the disease. Data for Hawaii – for which the model has the poorest fit
– are most indicative of this pattern.
For such locations, we propose an alternate multi-phase model. The Hawaii
Department of Health announced the first positive case on Oahu, Hawaii, on March 6th
and then enacted a stay at home order on March 25th . From April 19th to May 7th , the
case curve flattened. The state announced on May 7th that Hawaii would embark on
the first phase of reopening. The data reflect a second wave of coronavirus commencing
on or about May 7th .
We divide the Hawaii timeline into two periods, the first from March 6th until May
th
7 , and the second from May 7th to July 28th . We fit the first stage with the
initialization of only one exposed people at the start. To initialize the second phase, we
use the predicted number of exposed people, infectious people and recovered people
from the first phase, combined with the reported deaths as of May 7th . With this
modification, the RRMSE for cases declines below 2.5% and the RRMSE for deaths
declines below 2.7%. The fitting results in Figure 9 show that our two-phase model
captures the transmission pattern more precisely than the single-phase model.

starts from March 6 to May 7; The second phase (right figures) starts from May 7 to

The history of effective reproduction number and death rate are shown in Figure 10.
The first phase showed a decline in the reproduction number after the initial
announcement of the stay-at-home order. However, with the reopening, the
reproduction number increased, explaining increases in case rates. Death rates, by
contrast, exhibit a peculiar behavior, increasing over time in each phase, with a
discontinuity when transitioning from the first phase to the second. Beyond exhibiting
two phases, Hawaii has a small number of deaths, with no deaths occurring in the
transition period between phases. We surmise that the function, while representing the
data well, is peculiar because of the unusual pattern in deaths within Hawaii.

Conclusions

304

We have developed an extension of the SEIRD model that represents changing
transmission and death rates over time as a continuous Sigmoid function, under the
hypothesis that these rates change gradually, rather than immediately upon
implementation of public health policies or treatments. The model fits historical data
for the United States well for most states. Those with poorer fits exhibit patterns of
multiple waves of the disease. Using Hawaii as an example, a multi-phase extension of
the model provides a more accurate fit, where the transition from one phase to the next
is defined by a change in public health policy.
An advantage of the model is that it is defined by a small set of parameters. Thus, it
provides an efficient method for quantifying differences among regions in the spread and
outcomes of the disease. In the future, we intend to examine the predictive value for the
model, taking into consideration ranges of uncertainty in model estimates. By
examining historical trends, we can understand how variations in simple parameters can
lead to fewer or more cases and deaths. In the future, we will develop multi-region
extensions of the model, which permit representation of spread of disease from one
region to another, or perhaps within sub-regional groups.
Our research is premised on the method of modeling case and death data as they are
reported. We recognize that the true number of cases may differ from reported values,
as might the number of deaths, both of which are unknown. The variations from state
to state reflect in part the actual spread and outcomes of disease, as well as the extent
to which cases are detected and reported, as well as how deaths have been classified.
