Abstract
Objectives:

To identify exercise tests that are suitable for home-based or remote administration in

people with chronic lung disease.

Methods:

Rapid review of studies that reported home-based or remote administration of an

exercise test in people with chronic lung disease, and studies reporting their clinimetric properties.

Results:

84 studies were included. Tests used at home were the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, 2

studies), sit-to-stand tests (STS, 5 studies), Timed Up and Go (TUG, 4 studies) and step tests (2

studies). Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (2 studies) and step test (1 study).

Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but

shorter when performed at home (2 studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable

(intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and

moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less

desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported.

Discussion

: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document

desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be

prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.

Introduction
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many pulmonary rehabilitation programs have transitioned

rapidly to remote delivery models.

1, 2

Whilst studies have shown it is possible to deliver exercise

training, physical activity counselling, education and self-management training remotely, all existing

clinical trials have included an in-person exercise test prior to program commencement, to assess

safety of exercise (e.g. degree of oxyhaemoglobin desaturation) and enable accurate exercise

prescription.

3, 4

During the COVID-19 pandemic centre-based or in-person assessments of exercise

capacity are not able to be performed in most centres. As a result, some pulmonary rehabilitation

programs have commenced exercise testing at home, using tests with minimal space requirements

such as sit-to-stand (STS) or step tests, and with or without remote monitoring of oxyhaemoglobin

saturation (SpO2) and heart rate. Other programs are not conducting any exercise testing prior to
commencing patients on pulmonary rehabilitation programs at home. It is not clear which of our

current tests of functional exercise capacity are suitable for home and / or remote administration.

The research questions for this rapid review were:

1. Which functional exercise tests have been conducted in the home setting in people with chronic

lung disease?

2. Which functional exercise tests have been conducted remotely in people with chronic lung

disease?

3. What are the clinimetric properties of tests that have been conducted at home or remotely,

including feasibility, reliability, validity and responsiveness to pulmonary rehabilitation?

4. Can these functional exercise tests be used to assess safety (particularly oxyhaemoglobin

saturation) and prescribe exercise intensity, either in-person or remotely?

Methods
The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020182375) on 27

th

April 2020. Inclusion criteria

are presented in Box 1.

Types of studies:

We included any study that reported conducting an exercise test at home or

remotely in people with chronic respiratory disease. We also included studies conducted in any

setting that report use of tests that were being conducted at home in people with chronic

respiratory disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically step tests and sit-to-stand (STS)

tests. . These studies were included in order to report on their clinimetric properties (quality of

measurement instruments e.g. reproducibility) and clinical properties (e.g. ability to detect

desaturation and prescribe exercise). We did not include studies that reported the clinimetric

properties of the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in a centre-based setting, as these have been reported

in detail in a previous systematic review.

5

We did not include case studies. Review articles were not included, but we reviewed their reference

lists for studies that met our inclusion criteria. Otherwise there were no restrictions on study design.

We included studies investigating clinimetric properties, descriptive studies and studies where the

test was used to evaluate the effects of an intervention. Only studies published in English were

included.

Participants:

We included studies in which participants had any chronic lung disease including (but

not limited to) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), asthma,

cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis or pulmonary hypertension. We did not exclude studies based on

age, gender or physiological status of participants. We excluded studies that focused on participants

who were mechanically ventilated.

Search methods for identification of studies:

As this was a rapid review designed to respond to the

emerging COVID-19 pandemic, we elected to search MEDLINE from year 2000 to 25

th

April 2020.

The search strategy for MEDLINE is in supplementary Table 1. One author reviewed the title and

abstract of the identified studies to determine their inclusion.

Data extraction and management:

One author conducted data extraction using a standardised

template, with random checks on accuracy by a second reviewer. The following information was

extracted:

•

Methods of study (date/title of study, aim of study, study design, primary outcome, other

outcomes)

•

Participants (diagnosis, age, sex, disease severity, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria,

method of recruitment of participants)

•

Intervention (if applicable, description of the intervention)

•

Exercise test - name, details of protocol (if provided), location of test (home, centre, other)

and monitoring (in person, remote, none), variables monitored

•

Outcomes pre/post intervention data where applicable, details of clinimetric properties if

applicable

•

Details of any physiological monitoring, including but not limited to pulse oximetry

•

Whether the results of the test were used to prescribe exercise and if so, the methods used.

Assessment of risk of bias:

We considered risk of bias according to study design and methods of

analysis, and this was documented in the data extraction form. As this was a rapid review we did not

conduct a formal assessment using a risk of bias tool.

Outcomes:

The main outcomes of interest were the number of reports of home or remote

administration of each exercise test. Additional outcomes were patient variables monitored for each

test (e.g. SpO2, heart rate, symptoms, blood pressure); methods used to prescribe exercise training
intensity; and clinimetric properties for each test - feasibility, reliability, validity and responsiveness,

using the metrics reported by the authors.

Data synthesis:

A narrative synthesis was performed for each exercise test separately. For each

exercise test we reported whether it had been performed at home or with remote monitoring,

including the number of reports. Patient variables monitored for each test (e.g. SpO2, heart rate,
symptoms, blood pressure) were reported descriptively. Any methods used to prescribe exercise

training intensity were reported descriptively.

We reported clinimetric properties for each test, from all studies where these are reported, not just

those performed at home. We reported feasibility (eg number of participants who could perform the

test), reliability (e.g. intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)), validity (e.g. correlation with gold

standard exercise tests) and responsiveness to pulmonary rehabilitation (e.g mean changes pre/post

rehabilitation and measures of variability). Where possible we calculated an effect size to describe

responsiveness.

We had intended to examine outcomes separately by subgroups with different lung diseases (e.g.

COPD, ILD), but there were insufficient data for diseases other than COPD, so these analyses were

not performed.

centre (30 metres) and 42% of tests were conducted indoors. Comparison of indoor vs outdoors

6MWT (conducted on a flat sidewalk), both using a 30-metre track, showed no difference in the

distance walked(Table 1).

Remote: Two studies by the same group aimed to validate two different phone apps for remote

monitoring of the 6MWT in people with chronic respiratory conditions (mostly COPD and asthma).

8, 9

Both apps recorded the 6-minute walk distance using accelerometry, and one also provided voice

and vibrating instructions.

8

Both apps included monitoring by pulse oximetry, however these data

were not reported. The 6-minute walk distance measured by the apps was similar to that measured

by the researchers in person (Table 1).

Feasibility: One study in participants with COPD reported that 58% of tests were conducted outdoors

because a track of sufficient length was not available inside the home.

Intra-rater reliability was high for both outdoor and indoor

7

Safety assessment: All studies reported monitoring the 6MWT using pulse oximetry and three also

used symptom scales for dyspnoea and perceived exertion.

6, 7, 10

Exercise prescription: One study used the 6MWT for exercise prescription in 39 people with COPD.

10

Walking exercise was prescribed at 80% of the average speed walked on the 6MWT. This exercise

prescription was well tolerated over 10 minutes of walking, generally achieving more than 60% of

peak oxygen uptake (VO2) with a steady state by the 4

th

minute.

Sit-to-stand tests
Six different STS tests were used (Table S2). These were the five times sit to stand test (5STS, 14

studies), where the time taken to stand up and sit down five times from a standard height chair is

recorded; the ten times sit to stand test (10STS, 2 studies) using a similar protocol; the 30-second sit

to stand test (30secSTS, 9 studies) where the number of sit-to-stand repetitions in 30 seconds is

recorded; the 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1minSTS, 13 studies) as well as small numbers of studies

using 2-minute tests (2minSTS, 1 study) and 3-minute tests (3minSTS, 2 studies).

All home testing involved in-person supervision from a researcher or clinician.

Remote: No studies reported remote administration or monitoring of a STS test.

Feasibility: In a study of patients with stable COPD (n=475), 15% of participants were unable to

26

complete the 5STS.

Those who were unable to complete the test were significantly older (mean

(SD) 73(10) vs 68(10) years), had higher levels of chronic dyspnoea (Medical Research Council scale

4.1(1.0) vs 3.3(1.1) points), lower quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (44(13) vs

60(17)%predicted) and lower incremental shuttle walk distance (84(66) vs 224 (126) metres). A study

comparing the 5STS to the 30secSTS in 128 people with moderate to severe COPD reported that all

participants could complete the 5STS but 7% could not complete two trials of the 30secSTS.

44

One

additional trial reported that 3 of 50 participants with COPD (6%) could not complete any repetitions

of the 30secSTS.

25

Of those participants who felt it was strenuous to undergo a STS (69%), most

(93%) found the 30secSTS more strenuous than the 5STS.

44

In a clinical trial of inpatient pulmonary

rehabilitation including 60 participants with moderate to severe COPD, all could complete both the

30secSTS and the 1minSTS.

43

No feasibility data were reported for the 10STS, 2minSTS or 3minSTS.

Clinimetric properties: Reliability, validity and responsiveness of STS tests are in Table 2. Test-retest

reliability was high for the 5STS, 30secSTS and 1minSTS. The 5STS, 30secSTS and 1minSTS had

moderate to strong correlations with other measures of exercise capacity, with higher values for the

1minSTS than the other tests. There were moderate correlations with quadriceps strength and weak

correlations with daily life physical activity. Predictive validity was demonstrated only for the

1minSTS, with lower values predicting increased mortality at 2 and 5 years.

20, 35

Responsiveness to

pulmonary rehabilitation was evident for 5STS, 30secSTS and 1minSTS, with moderate to large effect

sizes.

Safety assessment: Most studies did not report using any monitoring during the STS test (24 / 40

studies, 60%, Table S2).

A comparison of three STS tests in people with COPD found significantly greater desaturation on the

1minSTS than the 30secSTS or 5STS (mean -3(SD 4) vs -1(2) and -1(2) respectively).

31

Greater

desaturation on 1minSTS than 30secSTS was reported in a second study in COPD (mean -2.6 (2) vs

43

2(1.8).

The 1minSTS also gave rise to significantly greater increases in heart rate than the 30secSTS

or 5STS (mean 22(13) vs 16 (10) and 7(7)) and higher fatigue scores (median 2 vs 0.5 vs 0).

31

Dyspnoea scores on 1minSTS did not differ from the 30secSTS but were significantly greater than

5STS (median 2.5 vs 1 vs 0) with a similar pattern of findings for systolic blood pressure (median 30

vs 20 vs 0 mmHg).

31

In comparison to the 6MWT and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), the 1minSTS provoked less

oxyhaemoglobin desaturation and a smaller rise in heart rate (Table 3). The VO2peak was also
significantly lower during 1minSTS than during the CPET (median 1.68 [IQR 1.38, 2.29] vs 1.25 [1.03,

36

1.86]).

Symptom scores for dyspnoea and fatigue were variable, with some studies reporting that

Exercise prescription: No studies used any of the STS tests for exercise prescription.

Step tests:
Five different step tests were used (Table 3): 6-minute stepper test (6MStepper)(15 studies), using a

hydraulic stepper; a 3-minute step test (3MST)(9 studies), most at a fixed cadence (7 studies);

incremental step tests (5 studies), where the stepping rate increases regularly throughout the test,

using either the Chester protocol (4 studies) or a version modified for patients with lung disease

(modified incremental step test, MIST, 3 studies); a step oximetry test (4 studies) involving either

stepping on and off a single step 15 times (3 studies) or for as long as possible (1 study); and a 6-

minute step test on a single step at a free cadence (2 studies).

Home: Two studies (3 reports) used the 6MStepper to assess exercise capacity before and after a

rehabilitation program at home.

18, 23, 49

These tests used a hydraulic stepper with in-person

supervision in the home. Participants (n=337) had moderate to severe COPD and some were using

long-term oxygen therapy.

Remote: One study compared a remotely supervised 3MST to a 3MST monitored in person in 10

adults with CF and moderate lung disease.

58

Remote supervision took place via videoconferencing

and included measures of SpO2 and pulse rate via pulse oximetry, with the monitor visible to the
health professional via videoconferencing. Measures of dyspnoea and perceived exertion were also

collected. There was good agreement between the directly supervised and remotely supervised tests

for nadir SpO2, pulse rate and rate of perceived exertion (Table 1). Nine of ten participants indicated
no preference for in-person or remote supervision, with one participant preferring in-person

supervision.

Feasibility:

Feasibility varied across the different step tests. One study reported that in patients with

bronchiectasis the Chester Step Test was not as well tolerated as the MIST, which starts at a lower

cadence and increases more slowly.

56

The Chester Step Test was stopped more frequently than the

MIST by the examiner (58% vs 41% of tests), either because the participant could not maintain the

cadence, or due to desaturation.

In contrast the entire 3MST at fixed cadence was completed by 97

One study reported that all participants (n=84 with ILD) could complete the

however people using supplemental oxygen were not included. Some studies

excluded participants with orthopaedic problems that would have prevented them undertaking the

75

test,

making it difficult to assess the feasibility of tests across the population of people with chronic

lung disease.

Clinimetric properties: Reliability, validity and responsiveness of step tests are in Table 4. The

6minStepper, MIST and Chester step tests demonstrated good test-retest reliability, with limited

data for other tests. Although the ICC for the 6minStepper was high (0.94) the second test recorded

up to 42 steps more than the first test, due to warming of the hydraulic jacks in the stepper device.

responsiveness to pulmonary rehabilitation was only available for the 6minStepper and 3MST (free

cadence), with variable effect sizes.

Safety assessment: All studies reported monitoring step tests with pulse oximetry and most also

used symptom scales for dyspnoea and perceived exertion (Table S3). Several studies reported that

the degree of desaturation was less on the 6minStepper than on 6MWT (SpO2 2.3 to 3% more

In contrast, an incremental step test (MIST) resulted in greater

desaturation than a CPET (-7(5)% vs -3(3)%), but with similar rise in heart rate and similar

symptoms.

A 6MST with free cadence caused a greater rise in heart rate and more lower limb

fatigue than a 6MWT,

51

with similar findings for the 6minStepper.

63

Exercise prescription: Three studies of the 6minStepper had developed equations for exercise

prescription. Two studies generated reference equations for prescribing aerobic training based on

heart rate during the 6minStepper, but the equations were not validated.

53, 64

and there were no

reports of their use to set training intensity in pulmonary rehabilitation programs. A third study

developed reference equations for prescription of resistance training and compared actual vs

predicted training load (70% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM)).

52

The mean difference was 30kg, and

the authors concluded this difference was not clinically acceptable and the prediction equation

should not be used as a substitute for a 1RM measure.

Clinimetric properties: Reliability, validity and responsiveness of the TUG are in Table 5. Test-retest

reliability was high. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by moderate to strong relationships

between TUG time and other measures of exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance, peak work,

peak VO2) and peak quadriceps force, although one study reported no relationship between leg
press and TUG time (data not reported).

82, 84, 85

Responsiveness varied, with effect sizes ranging from small

to large, and the minimal detectable change (95%) ranging from 14 to 33.5%.

Safety assessment: Only one out of 16 studies (6%) reported any monitoring of physiological

variables during the TUG (Table S4).

Exercise prescription: No studies used the TUG to prescribe exercise.

Discussion
This rapid review identified a range of exercise tests that have been used at home with supervision

in people with chronic lung disease (6MWT, STS, 6minStepper and TUG) and a more limited range of

tests that have been administered remotely (6MWT, 3MST). Administration of the 6MWT at home

may be limited by short track lengths inside the house, although outdoors administration may

provide a valid alternative where this is possible. The STS, step tests and TUG are feasible to perform

in the home environment but do not reveal the full extent of desaturation with walking. These tests

are useful to quantify improvements in physical function with home-based pulmonary rehabilitation

but a gap remains in exercise prescription. Consideration should be given to identifying patients at

risk of desaturation in whom centre-based exercise testing should be prioritised when local

circumstances allow this to be performed safely.

This rapid review addresses an important challenge for pulmonary rehabilitation clinicians during the

COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation programs at home is feasible

international bodies are advocating for remote delivery,

1, 2

3, 4

and

assessment of exercise capacity remains a

key gap for many services. This review identifies a number of simple exercise tests that can be

performed at home with supervision, when social distancing restrictions allow. These tests allow

quantification of pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes, which is particularly important to evaluate in

the context of a rapidly changing model of care. The small number of studies on remote

administration of the 6MWT and 3MST provides some evidence that this approach would be feasible

in selected patients (eg those not at risk of falls), but more data are required. Whilst the

6minStepper has been used to prescribe exercise in a small number of studies, reliability of this test

may be limited by the equipment required, which appears to require a variable warm up period for

the hydraulic jacks.

to some patients than an in-home or centre-based test, allowing social distancing to be better

maintained.

Limitations to this review relate to both the body of evidence and the review process. The included

studies often included a small number of participants and used a wide variety of testing protocols,

which limited data synthesis. Feasibility of the tests was poorly documented and key patient groups

were often excluded from studies (e.g. those using oxygen therapy or those who could not perform

the test. Clinimetric properties of tests were rarely assessed in the home setting, but given the

nature of the tests (STS, step and TUG) and the use of face-to-face supervision, these seem unlikely

to vary substantially from those properties documented in centre-based testing. A small number of

studies were available for patient groups other than COPD. A rapid review process was selected to

ensure we could quickly address the immediate challenge facing the pulmonary rehabilitation

community, but inherent limitations to this process must be acknowledged, including searching a

single electronic database (Medline), a single author undertaking study selection, and a single author

performing data extraction with accuracy checks on a random sample by a second reviewer. As this

was a rapid review we did not perform a formal quality assessment, although data extraction

included risk of bias related to study design and analysis, which was considered during data

synthesis.

In conclusion, pulmonary rehabilitation clinicians can confidently perform STS, step and TUG tests at

home in people with chronic lung disease, where in-person supervision is possible. Remote

supervision may also be possible in selected patients, although few data are available. These in-

home tests are useful to quantify the outcomes of home-based pulmonary rehabilitation, but do not

reveal the full extent of desaturation on exercise, and validated methods to prescribe exercise

intensity are not available. Consideration should be given to identifying patients at risk of

desaturation in whom centre-based exercise testing should be prioritised, when local circumstances

allow this to be performed safely.
