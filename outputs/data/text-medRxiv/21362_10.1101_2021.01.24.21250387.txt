Abstract
Although previous studies have shown that the host immune response is crucial in
determining clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients, the association between host
immune signatures and COVID-19 patient outcomes remains unclear. Based on the
enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures (eight immune-inciting and three immuneinhibiting signatures) in leukocytes of 100 COVID-19 patients, we identified three
COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. Im-C1 had
the lowest immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2
had medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. ImC3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting
signatures. Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the best and worst clinical outcomes,
respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of
COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response
had a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response. The
patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger persons
have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless, we did
not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in COVID19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was an
adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19. Our identification of COVID-19 immune
subtypes has potential clinical implications for the management of COVID-19
patients.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than 36
million cases and one million deaths as of October 8, 2020 (1). The host immune
defense system and immune response are crucial factors responsible for clinical
outcomes in COVID-19 patients (2-7). For example, Takahashi et al. demonstrated
that sex biases in COVID-19 were associated with differences in immune responses
between males and females (2). The excessive immune response to SARS-CoV-2,
known as COVID-19 cytokine storm, may cause severe COVID-19 (8). Despite these
previous studies, the association between host immune responses and clinical
outcomes in COVID-19 patients remains unclear.

In this study, using a publicly available RNA-Seq gene expression profiles in 100
leukocyte samples from COVID-19 patients (9), we performed an unsupervised
learning to identify COVID-19 subtypes based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune
signatures. Furthermore, we characterized the immunological and clinical features of
these COVID-19 subtypes.

Results
Identification of COVID-19 subtypes based on immune signature
enrichment levels
Based on the enrichment levels of 11 immune signatures, using the hierarchical
clustering method, we identified three COVID-19 immune subtypes, termed Im-C1,
Im-C2, and Im-C3 (Fig. 1A). Im-C1 had the lowest enrichment levels of HLA Class II,
CD8+ T cells, Tfh, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, NK cells, pDCs, and cytolytic activity
(termed immune-inciting signatures) while high enrichment levels of type II IFN

response, Treg, and neutrophils (termed immune-inhibiting signatures). Im-C2 had
medium immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. In
contrast to Im-C1, Im-C3 had the highest immune-inciting signatures and the lowest
immune-inhibiting signatures. Thus, Im-C3 and Im-C1 displayed the strongest and
weakest antiviral immune responses, respectively. As expected, the ratios of immunestimulatory to immune-inhibitory signatures (CD8+/CD4+ regulatory T cells and pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines) were the highest in Im-C3 and the lowest in Im-C1
(one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 1B). Principal component analysis
confirmed that these COVID-19 cases could be divided into three subgroups based on
the ssGSEA scores of these immune signatures (Fig. 1C).

We found that the proportion of the COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care
unit (ICU) was the lowest in Im-C3 (23.5%) and the highest in Im-C1 (92.6%)
(Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1D). Moreover, the proportion of COVID-19
patients requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS) was the lowest in Im-C3
(8.8%) and the highest in Im-C1 (81.5%) (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0.001). The scores
of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and the
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), both of which measure the severity of
ICU patients (10), were significantly different between the three subtypes: Im-C3 <
Im-C2 < Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1E). The numbers
of ventilator-free days, which is an outcome measure in treatments for acute
respiratory distress syndrome (11), and the hospital-free days at day 45 (HFD-45)
values, which correlated inversely with disease severity, were significantly different
between the three subtypes: Im-C3 > Im-C2 > Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann–Whitney U
test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 1E). Additionally, some laboratory measurements, such as C-

reactive protein, D-dimer, procalcitonin, ferritin, and lactate, whose elevation was
associated with COVID-19 severity, tended to display the lowest levels in Im-C3
while the highest levels in Im-C1 (Fig. 1F). Altogether, these results showed that the
Im-C3 subtype of COVID-19 had the best outcomes, while the Im-C1 subtype had the
worst outcomes. It suggests that antiviral immune responses can reduce COVID-19
disease severity. Furthermore, we found that the patients in Im-C3 were younger than
those in Im-C1 (one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test, P = 0.04) (Fig. 1G). It indicates
that younger persons tended to have a stronger antiviral immune response than older
persons after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we did not observe a significant
difference in the proportions of female and male patients between Im-C3 and Im-C1
(Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.61).

Associations between immune signatures and clinical features in
COVID-19 patients
We further analyzed associations between immune signatures and clinical features in
COVID-19 patients. As expected, the elevated enrichment of the eight immuneinciting signatures were correlated with higher HFD-45 values and more ventilatorfree days (Spearman’s correlation test, P < 0.01, ρ > 0.3) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, their
enrichment levels were significantly higher in non-ICU versus ICU patients and in
non-MVS versus MVS patients (one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2B).
Collectively, these results indicate that the enrichment of these immune-inciting
signatures has a positive association with outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In addition,
we found five immune-inciting signatures (HLA Class II, CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells,
Th2 cells, and NK cells) whose enrichment levels correlated inversely with ages of
COVID-19 patients (P < 0.1, ρ < -0.18) (Fig. 2C). However, none of the eight
immune-inciting signatures showed significantly different enrichment levels between

female and male patients. Again, these results indicate that younger patients have a
stronger immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection than older patients, while the
strength of immune response is not different between female and male patients. We
further demonstrated the significant negative correlation between the immune-inciting
signatures and ages of COVID-19 patients in two other RNA-Seq gene expression
profiling datasets for COVID-19 patients (GSE156063 (12) and GSE152075 (13) (Fig.
2C). Likewise, the associations between gender and these immune-inciting signatures
were not significant in both datasets. Interestingly, in GSE156063, six immuneinciting signatures displayed significantly lower enrichment levels in COVID-19
patients than in the patients infected with other viruses (one-tailed Mann–Whitney U
test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 2D). It suggests that SARS-CoV-2 causes a weaker human host
immune response compared to other viruses, a potential explanation for the higher
infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 versus other viruses. In contrast to the
immune-inciting signatures, the immune-inhibiting signatures were likely to have a
negative correlation with outcomes in COVID-19 patients, as evidenced by that the
three immune-inhibiting signatures (type II IFN response, Treg, and neutrophils)
displayed significantly higher enrichment levels in MVS than in non-MVS patients
(one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test, P < 0.05) (Fig. 2E). In addition, the type II IFN
response signature had inverse correlations with ventilator-free days and HFD-45
values (P < 0.05, ρ < -0.21) and was significantly higher in ICU versus non-ICU
patients (Fig. 2F).

Comparison of the contribution of different factors in the prediction
of COVID-19 outcomes
To compare the contribution of different factors in the prediction of outcomes in
COVID-19 patients, we used the logistic regression model with five predictors (age,

gender, CD8+ T cell score, NK cell score, and type II IFN response score) to predict
ICU (= 1) versus non-ICU (= 0) and MVS (= 1) versus non-MVS (= 0) patients,
respectively. In predicting MVS versus non-MVS, age, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells
were significant negative predictors, while type II IFN response was a significant
positive predictor (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3). In predicting ICU versus non-ICU, CD8+ T
cells and NK cells were significant negative predictors (P < 0.1), while type II IFN
response was a positive predictor (P = 0.186, β = 1.98). These results indicate that
COVID-19 outcomes are correlated positively with immune-inciting signatures and
negatively with immune-inhibiting signatures and age, consistent with previous
results. Meanwhile, logistic regression analyses indicate that the adaptive immune
response (CD8+ T cells) has a stronger impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the
innate immune response (NK cells), as evidenced by the larger β values of CD8+ T
cells versus NK cells in predicting ICU and MVS.

Identification of gene ontology differentially enriched between
COVID-19 subtypes
WGCNA identified seven gene modules (indicated in cyan, light yellow, brown, light
green, magenta, black, and turquoise color, respectively) that significantly
differentiated COVID-19 patients by COVID-19 subtypes (Im-C1, Im-C2, and Im-C3)
and outcomes (HFD-45, ICU, and MVS) (Fig. 4). The representative gene ontology
(GO) terms associated with the gene modules highly enriched in Im-C3 while lowly
enriched in Im-C1 included viral transcription, mitochondrial protein complex, RNA
processing, and endoplasmic reticulum part. Consistently, these modules were
associated with better outcomes of COVID-19. Besides, the immune response
downregulated in Im-C1 was positively associated with COVID-19 outcomes. In
addition, the protein modification process representing the black module, which was

downregulated in Im-C3 while upregulated in Im-C2, correlated with worse outcome
of MVS.

Identification of genes and pathways differentially expressed between
ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients
We identified 67 and 309 genes upregulated and downregulated in ICU versus nonICU COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S1). We found a number
of immune-related pathways associated with the upregulated genes in non-ICU,
including antigen processing and presentation, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity,
hematopoietic cell lineage, intestinal immune network for IgA production, T cell
receptor signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, Tolllike receptor signaling, RIG-I-like receptor signaling, cytosolic DNA-sensing, JakSTAT signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, and Fc epsilon RI signaling (Fig. 5B).
Again, these results indicate the stronger immune response in non-ICU versus ICU
COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, we performed a prediction of ICU versus non-ICU
patients based on gene expression profiles in leukocyte samples from 100 COVID-19
patients (GSE157103). The 3-fold cross validation (CV) accuracy was 83.1%, and the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 91.5% (Fig. 5C). It indicates that the gene
expression profiles in leukocytes of COVID-19 patients could be a potentially useful
predictor for the severity of COVID-19.

Discussion
Based on the enrichment levels (ssGSEA scores) of 11 immune signatures in
leukocytes of COVID-19 patients, we identified three COVID-19 subtypes: Im-C1,
Im-C2, and Im-C3, by clustering analysis. The ssGSEA scores-based clustering

method has been shown to be more robust than the gene expression values-based
method in identifying subtypes of diseases (14-16). Im-C1 had the lowest immuneinciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C2 had medium
immune-inciting signatures and high immune-inhibiting signatures. Im-C3 had the
highest immune-inciting signatures while the lowest immune-inhibiting signatures.
Im-C3 and Im-C1 COVID-19 patients had the best and worst clinical outcomes,
respectively, suggesting that antiviral immune responses alleviated the severity of
COVID-19 patients. We further demonstrated that the adaptive immune response
exerted a greater impact on COVID-19 outcomes than the innate immune response.
The patients in Im-C3 were younger than those in Im-C1, indicating that younger
persons have stronger antiviral immune responses than older persons. Nevertheless,
we did not observe a significant association between sex and immune responses in
COVID-19 patients. In addition, we found that the type II IFN response signature was
an adverse prognostic factor for COVID-19 in the dataset GSE157103. This result
appears inconsistent with previous findings (17-18). The reason behind this needs to
be further investigated.

Our data suggest that a strong antiviral immune response can reduce COVID-19
severity. Thus, a strong host immune system is crucial for fighting against COVID-19,
as bolstered by a recent study (19). However, previous studies have revealed that
serum inflammatory cytokine levels had an inverse association with clinical outcomes
in COVID-19 patients (20-23). It suggests that excessive immune response, known as
cytokine storm, may cause immunopathological damage in COVID-19 patients (7).
We compared the expression levels of several cytokine genes in leukocytes between
ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF, CCL2, CXCL10,

IFNG, IL7. We found that these genes displayed significantly higher expression levels
in non-ICU than in ICU patients (Fig. 5). A potential explanation for these different
results could be the different sources of these cytokine.

Methods
Datasets
We downloaded the RNA-Seq gene expression profile datasets in leukocyte samples
from 100 COVID-19 patients (GSE157103) and in SARS-CoV-2-infected human
tissues from nasopharyngeal swabs (GSE152075 and GSE156063) from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Supplementary
Table S2 summarizes these datasets.

Quantification of the enrichment levels of immune signatures
We used the single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) score [24] to
evaluate the enrichment level of an immune signature in a COVID-19 patient based
on the gene expression profiles. The ssGSEA score represents the enrichment score of
a gene set in a sample based on the degree of the genes in the gene set coordinately
up- or down-regulated in the sample. We analyzed 11 immune signatures, including
HLA Class II, CD8+ T cells, Tfh, Th1 cells. The gene sets representing these immune
signatures are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

Clustering analysis
We hierarchically clustered 100 leukocyte samples from COVID-19 patients
(GSE157103) based on the ssGSEA scores of the 11 immune cell types. We

performed the clustering analysis by using the R function “hclust” for hierarchical
agglomerative clustering.

Logistic regression analysis
We used logistic regression with five predictors (age, gender, CD8+ T cell score, NK
cell score, and type II IFN response score) to predict ICU and MVS, respectively. The
logistic regression analysis utilized the R function “glm” to fit the binary model and
the R function “lm.beta” in the R package “QuantPsyc” to calculate the standardized
regression coefficients (β values).

Identification of gene ontology associated with COVID-19 subtypes
We used WGCNA (25) to identify the gene modules differentially enriched in
COVID-19 subtypes and outcomes. The representative gene ontology (GO) terms
associated with the gene modules were identified. The WGCNA analysis was
performed by using the R package “WGCNA” (version 1.68).

Pathway analysis
We identified differentially expressed genes between ICU and non-ICU COVID-19
patients using Student’s t test with a threshold of adjusted P-value (false discovery
rate (FDR) < 0.05 and fold change (FC) of mean expression levels > 2. Based on the
differentially expressed genes, we identified KEGG (26) pathways differentially
enriched between ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients by (27) with a threshold of
FDR < 0.05. The FDR was calculated by using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (28).

We predicted ICU versus non-ICU patients based on gene expression profiles in
leukocyte samples from 100 COVID-19 patients (GSE157103). We performed 3-fold
CV in the 100 samples. Within each loop of the CV, we selected the 100 genes with
the largest absolute t-scores in the comparison of ICU versus non-ICU patients in the
training set; based on the 100 genes, we trained the Random Forest (RF) classifier and
predicted ICU versus non-ICU patients in the test set. We reported the prediction
performance (accuracy and AUC) as the average of them in the 3-fold CV. We carried
out the prediction algorithm in Weka (29) with the number of trees in the RF set to
500.

Statistical analysis
In comparison of two classes of data, we used Mann–Whitney U test if they were not
normally distributed and used Student’s t test if they were normally distributed. We
used Spearman’s correlation test to evaluate the correlation between two groups of
data on the assumption that they were not normally distributed. We used Fisher’s
exact test to evaluate the association between two categorical variables. All statistical
analyses were performed in the R programming environment (version 4.0.2).

Fig. 1. Identification of COVID-19 immune subtypes. A. Hierarchical clustering of
100 COVID-19 patients based on the enrichment scores of 11 immune signatures in
leukocytes. B. Comparisons of the ratios of immune-stimulatory to immune-inhibitory
signatures between the three COVID-19 subtypes. The ratios were the mean
expression levels of the marker genes of immune-stimulatory signatures over those of
immune-inhibitory signatures (log2-transformed). The Student’s t test P-values are
indicated. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001 (This also applies to the following
figures). C. Principal component analysis confirming that COVID-19 can be divided
into three subgroups based on the enrichment scores of the 11 immune signatures. D.
Proportions of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) or requiring
mechanical ventilatory support (MVS) in the COVID-19 subtypes. E. Comparisons of
the scores of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) and
the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), ventilator-free days, and the
hospital-free days at day 45 (HFD-45) values between the three COVID-19 subtypes.
F. Comparisons

of

the

COVID-19

severity-associated

laboratory

measurements between COVID-19 subtypes. G. Comparisons of the age between
COVID-19 subtypes. The one-tailed Mann–Whitney U test P-values are shown.
Fig. 2. Associations between immune signatures and clinical features in COVID19 patients. A. Associations between immune signature scores and HFD-45 values
and ventilator-free days. The Spearman’s correlation test P-values and correlation
coefficients are shown. B. Comparisons of immune signature scores between ICU and
non-ICU patients and between MVS and non-MVS patients. The one-tailed Mann–
Whitney U test P-values are shown. C. Associations between immune signature
scores and age. D. Comparisons of immune signature scores between COVID-19
patients and the patients infected with other viruses. E. Comparisons of the scores of
three immune-inhibiting signatures (type II IFN response, Treg, and neutrophils)
between non-MVS and MVS patients. F. The scores of type II IFN response have
negative correlations with HFD-45 values and ventilator-free days and are higher in
ICU than in non-ICU patients.
Fig. 3. Prediction of ICU versus non-ICU and MVS versus non-MVS patients
using five predictors (age, gender, CD8+ T cell score, NK cell score, and type II
IFN response score) by logistic regression analyses. The standardized regression
coefficients (β values) are shown.

Fig. 4. WGCNA identified seven gene modules significantly differentiating
COVID-19 patients by COVID-19 subtypes and outcomes. The representative
gene ontology terms for gene modules, correlation coefficients, and P-values are
shown.
Fig. 5. Genes and pathways differentially expressed between ICU and non-ICU
COVID-19 patients. A. Heatmap for 50 and 50 genes showing the highest increases
and decreases of the fold change of mean expression levels in ICU versus non-ICU
patients, respectively. B. Immune-related pathways upregulated in ICU versus nonICU patients. C. Prediction performance of gene expression profiles in leukocyte
samples from 100 COVID-19 patients in the prediction of ICU versus non-ICU
patients by Random Forest. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is shown for each
loop of the 3-fold cross validation (CV).
Fig. 6. Comparisons of the expression levels of cytokine genes in leukocytes
between ICU and non-ICU COVID-19 patients. The Student’s t test P-values are
shown.
