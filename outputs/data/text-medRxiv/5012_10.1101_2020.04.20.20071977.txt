(Dated: 19th April 2020)
We analyze current data on the COVID-19 spreading in Okinawa, Japan. We find that
the initial spread is characterized by a doubling time of about 5 days. We implement a
model to forecast the future spread under different scenarios. The model predicts that, if
significant containment measures are not taken, a large fraction of the population will be
infected with COVID-19, with the peak of the epidemic expected at the end of May and
intensive care units having largely exceeded capacity. We analyzed scenarios implementing
strong containment measures, similar to those imposed in Europe. The model predicts that
an immediate implementation of strong containment measures (on the 19th of April) will
significantly reduce the death count. We assess the negative consequences of these measures
being implemented with a delay, or not being sufficiently stringent.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The first cases of COVID-19 epidemic in Okinawa were detected in mid-February 2020. After
these few early cases, the epidemic was seemingly contained. The situation in Okinawa in February
2020 reflected a more general Japanese scenario where the epidemic was growing at a very slow
pace, in contrast to the exponential growth in the case counts observed first in China, then in
Europe, USA, and worldwide.
The situation in Japan and in Okinawa has drastically worsened since the end of March and
beginning of April 2020. In this manuscript, we focus on the Okinawan case. Current data reveal
that the number of cases in Okinawa in April 2020 has been growing exponentially, with a doubling
time of about 5 days, see Fig. 1. This doubling time is very close to the one characterizing the
early spreading dynamics in Wuhan, China [2, 3]. The last few data points seem to slightly depart
from the exponential curve. It is difficult to assess at this stage whether this departure is due to
early containment measures, or simply due to fluctuations. In the following, we shall first discuss
a scenario in which no effective containment measures are in place. This scenario is idealized, as

RESULTS

Model - no containment

Our main tool is a model designed to predict and track the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic
in a given region [4]. The model is a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model with
realistic parameters for COVID-19 epidemics. Each of these categories is divided into age groups
to account for the observed age-dependent risks [5]. The model permits to describe the import of
cases from outside the region, assesses the case load on hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs)
and includes a mortality risk due to ICUs exceeding capacity. It has recently been used to assess
the epidemic risk in the Chicago, USA metropolitan area [6]. These characteristics make it an ideal
model for our aims. We also developed an alternative SEIR model similar to that in [3] to verify
the robustness of our results.

We adapted the model to the Okinawan scenario. To this aim, we used currently available
estimates on COVID-19 parameters such as its incubation time and serial time [7–9], information
about air travelers to Okinawa, data on age distribution of the Okinawan population, and daily
number of confirmed and hospitalized cases in the Okinawan prefecture [1]. The model currently
does not implement a regional age distribution, so that our simulations are performed using the
Japanese age distribution. We shall discuss the potential impact of the different age distribution
in Okinawa and Japan. Parameter choices and their rationale are further discussed in Methods.
We first run the model in a no-containment scenario, where the epidemic will keep spreading
with the rate observed in Fig. 1 until herd immunity is reached. A crucial parameter to describe
an epidemic is R0 , the average number of infection caused by one infected person. We find that
an R0 close to 2.5 provides a good fit of rate of increase in the number of hospitalized case as a
function of time. Beside the parameters discussed in Methods, we had to make an assumption
about the initial number of cases. We conventionally set the start of the simulation on the 15th
of March 2020, a few days before the recent outbreak. We adjusted the initial number of cases so
that the model fitted the number of hospitalized patients. Such procedure leads to estimate that
in Okinawa there were about 10 cases on the 15th of March.
When fitting the number of hospitalized cases, the model predicts a staggering number of unseen
cases. In particular, the model infers that by the 15th of April there were several thousands of
infected and already recovered people in Okinawa – a number about 50 times larger than the
number of confirmed cases. To understand this discrepancy, we compared with estimates from
Europe. A recent study [8] performed a Bayesian analysis to estimate the percentage of infected
populations in European countries on the 15th of March, 2020. We compared their results with
the numbers of confirmed cases in Table III. This analysis reveals similar ratios between estimated
and confirmed cases, especially in countries that did not perform extensive testing. In any case, a
more conservative estimate of the number of infected cases would not significantly alter our results.
In the absence of containment measures, the model predicts that a large fraction of the Okinawan
population will bereached by the contagion, with a peak occurring roughly at the end of May. At
the peak, the model predicts about 5,000 critical patients requiring an ICU bed, far more than the
existing capacity. The predicted cumulative death count by the end of the epidemic exceeds 20,000
people. A large fraction of these deaths are predicted to occur after the peak in the number of
infections. A crucial assumption underlying this number is that the death rate of critical patients
is doubled if no ICU bed is available. This means that about half of the deaths predicted by the
model are ascribed to ICUs exceeding capacity.

hospitalized infected patients in Okinawa as reported in [1]. Lines are modeling predictions (color scheme
explained in the legend). The gray horizontal line denotes the current ICU capacity in Okinawa (24 beds).
The dark red line (ICU) denotes the number of critical patients requiring ICU beds.

The alternative model we implemented predicts a number of deaths exceeding 10,000, with a
similar peak time. The alternative model does not include the additional risk due to ICU overflow,
so that the predictions of the two models are consistent. This supports that our result is robust
with respect to model idiosyncrasies. We used the alternative model to estimate the error made
in using the Japanese age distribution as a proxy of the Okinawan one. The model predicts that
this approximation leads to an overestimate of the death count by about 20%. This overestimate
should be taken into account also in the scenarios discussed in the next section.
One choice that could affect the result is fitting the curve of hospitalized patients, as this makes
the results dependent on the threshold for hospitalization in Okinawa. However, changing this
threshold would shift the result by a few days to one week, without affecting our main conclusion.
We also remark that a death toll of 10000 plus consequences of ICU capacity is consistent with
an order of magnitude estimate, as the average mortality rate of COVID-19 is estimated to exceed
1% [10]. In case of a continued, uncontained spreading, the contagion will affect a large fraction
of the Okinawan population, which consists of about 1.4 million individuals.

CONTAINMENT SCENARIOS

The scenario of the previous section does not take into account containment measures set
up in response to the epidemic spreading. Some measures have already been taken, including
suspension of some public events [11] and closing of schools [12]. We summarize the effect of
containment by the number Rt of infections caused by each infected individuals in the presence of
these measures. Due to containment, Rt is expected to be is reduced compared to R0 , which is
the same parameter in the absence of containment measures. The percentage reduction quantifies
the combined effectiveness of containment measurements. In this section, we consider scenarios
with different values of this reduction factor, and different implementation times. In the Discussion
section, we then assess which concrete measures might lead to these reduction factors, based on
the experience in European countries.
We first ran the model in a hypothetical scenario where containment measures result in a Rt
being 65% smaller compared to R0 . This percentage is chosen so that Rt is below one, meaning
that the measure is sufficient to stop the epidemic.

Different curves are different model predictions as in Fig. 2. The gray region marks the time interval where

The model estimates that such containment measures, if implemented on the 19th of April,
would bring down the death count to about 1000, including the effect of ICU overload, see Fig. 3,
left. In this scenario, the ICU capacity required at the peak is of roughly 170 beds.

To assess the effect of a delay in implementing containment, we simulated an alternative scenario
where the same containment measures are implemented on the 1st of May, see Fig. 3, right. In this
case, the model predicts about 4000 deaths, with a required ICU capacity at the peak of about
800 beds.

FIG. 4: Model results for a containment measure reducing Rt by 40% with respect to R0 . The measure acts
since the 19th of April, 2020. Different curves are different model predictions as in Fig. 2. The gray region
marks the time interval where containment measures are in place.

In the containment scenarios discussed so far, it is crucial that the implemented measures reduce
Rt below one. To show that this is the case, we simulated a scenario in which containment measures
implemented on the 19th of April reduces Rt by only 40% with respect to R0 , see Fig. 4. Our
model predicts that such measures will significantly slow down the epidemic, delaying its peak to
the beginning of July. However, in the presence of such measures the model predicts a total death
count at the end of the epidemic of about 14,000 and a required ICU capacity at the peak of about
2700 beds.

DISCUSSION

Our analysis of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Okinawa reveals that its initial exponential growth rate is similar to that observed first in Wuhan, and more recently in many European

countries. A model based on information gathered from these cases predicts that a rapid and strong
reduction in the rate of spread is necessary to avert scenarios in which the Okinawan health care
system will not be able to cope with the epidemic.
Some measures to contain the epidemic have already been taken, partially following the declaration of a state of emergency over the COVID-19 epidemic by the central government on the 8th
of April 2020. Measures taken in Okinawa include suspension of some public events [11], closing
of schools [12], and increased controls at the airport. The mild reduction in the growth rate of the
epidemic observed in the last days (Fig.1) could be due to these measures, if we take into account
an expected lag of more than one week between the introduction of a measure and its measurable
effects.
It is crucial to assess whether the measures in place are likely to have brought Rt below one. An
analysis of containment measures introduced in different European countries attempts at dissecting
the impact on Rt by these measures [8], see Table I. The median effect on Rt of measures such
as school closure, increased social distancing and public events is rather moderate according to
this analysis. It should be noted that these estimates are affected by a large variability, caused
by data quality and different ways in which these measures have been implemented in different
countries. A “lockdown” requires people to remain at home wherever possible, leaving their house
for essential trips only (to buy food, medicine, and take daily exercise), and avoiding groups. The
analysis in Table I shows that lockdowns in Europe have reduced Rt much more effectively than
other measures. Combined with our modeling results, this leads to the conclusion that Okinawa
should consider imposing soon some sort of lockdown.
Available data and the experience of European countries suggest that the containment scenarios
predicted by the model are realistic and therefore more stringent measures should be considered

in Okinawa. Nevertheless, the model we implemented are necessarily simplified and it will be
possible to perform more accurate estimates once more information is available, for example about
the potential seasonality of the epidemic. As the epidemic develops, we expect stronger measures
to be taken, that will possibly skew the numbers away from the example scenarios we considered.
It will be therefore important to update our analysis at these later stages, thereby assessing the
efficacy of such measures.

METHODS
Parameters

• Incubation time, infectivity period, and serial interval. The incubation time of
COVID-19 is estimated to be around 5 days [7, 8]. During this period, pre-symptomatic
transmission may occur, which is not included in the SEIR model. Recent analysis suggest
a serial interval, i.e. a time between consecutive infection in a chain of transmission, on the
order of 5 to 6 days [9]. To account for presymptomatic transmission and predict a correct
serial interval, we fix an effective incubation time of 3 days and an infectivity period of 5
days.
• R0 . Studies of the early Wuhan epidemics estimate R0 ≈ 2.2 [13], R0 ≈ 2.35 [7], R0 ≈ 2.57
[14]. More recent estimates tend to the lower end of this spectrum [3] and a slightly longer
generation time. In order to reproduce the observed doubling time in the number of cases
we determine R0 = 2.5. A more precise estimate of R0 from the doubling time would require
more detailed information about the distribution of infection intervals [15].
• Imported cases per day. We estimate roughly 1000 passengers per day arriving at Naha
airport in March and early April. The majority of this passengers are from mainland Japan.
In Japan, during this period, there were on the order of 1000 confirmed cases. Including a
correcion for a large number of unobserved case, similar to that in Table III, we assume that

1% of the Japanese population was infected during this time window. This assumption leads
to about 10 infected passengers arriving at Naha airport per day. A more precise estimate
would be important to describe more accurately the initial stage of the epidemic, but would
not significantly affect its development once a large number of cases are present in Okinawa.
• Population structure.
Population structure is an important determinant of COVID-19 severity. The model accounts
for the official age distribution of the population, but currently only at a national level, i.e.
it assumes that the age distribution in Okinawa is the same as in Japan. Okinawa has
a younger age distribution than Japan, see Table. II. A comparison using our alternative
SEIR model reveals that using the Japanese population structure instead of the Okinawan
one leads to an overestimate of the death count on the order of 20%.
