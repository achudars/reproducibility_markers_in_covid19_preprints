ABSTRACT:
Backgrounds: ​COVID-19 has grown rapidly in Lombardy, particularly in the province of
Bergamo. To deal with the pressure the pandemic has exerted on the Italian health system;
many hospitals have had to reorganize their medical and surgical activities. The aim of this
study was to evaluate how the pandemic influenced the emergency department and urgent
surgical activity ​in a medium-size hospital in the province of Bergamo.
Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the number of admissions to
the medical and surgical Emergency Room and their severity compared with those in the
same period in previous years ​(2011-2019). Admission in the medical and surgical
department and urgent surgical operation was also assessed.
Results: ​From March 7th to April 5th, 2020, we observe a reduction in emergency
department access (-53%) when compared with the corresponding period of previous years.
The number of medical admissions was similar to the past years (+0.9%), we observed a
drastic reduction of surgical patients (-82.5%). W​e experienced a significant increase in
hospitalizations in the medical department (+359%) and a reduction of admission in the
surgical department (- 71.2%).
Conclusion: ​SARS-CoV2 disease has spread so suddenly and severely that it has stressed
Italian health system, in particular the Lombard one. Our data show the rise of critical
medical ER accesses and the significant expansion in hospitalisation in the medical
department with the necessary hospital reorganisation to face COVID-19 emergency. We also
observed a reduction in both surgical ER accesses and urgent surgical activity.

INTRODUCTION:
The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19)
originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China 1​​ , and then spread rapidly worldwide, until
COVID-19 was WHO declared a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 2​​ . In Italy, Lombardy was
the most affected region, the first case was identified on February 20th, 2020 3–5​
​ . The
emergency of the situa​tion was clear from the beginning of virus spreading, so the
government delineated red-zone areas where the citizens were isolated for 14 days to limit
contact to try reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection 6​​ . Despite these measures, COVID-19 has
grown fo​llowing an exponential trend, so the Government declared a national lockdown in
the night between 9th an​d 10th March 2020 7​​ . The movement of individuals in the whole
Italian national territory was limited unless strictly motivated by work or health reasons.
Schools, museums, cinemas, theatres, and any other social, recreational, or cultural centre
must stay closed. Any gathering in public spaces is forbidden, including sporting events,
church and funerals. Most shops must stay closed. Those selling essentials, such as
supermarkets or pharmacies, need to ensure a distance of at least 1 m between customers 8–10​
​ .
The province of Bergamo is located in Lombardy and has 1.12 million inhabitants, it was one
of the most affected areas in Italy​11–13 with 997 COVID-19 positive patients on 7th March and
9.815 on April 5th (0.8% of Bergamo population, Italian Ministry of Health). It should
additionally be noted that the pharyngeal swab test was performed only on symptomatic
patients, so the number of cases is probably more significant. The epidemiological analysis of
Flaxman et al. estimated that in Italy cumulatively 5.9 million people have been infected as of
March 28th, giving an attack rate of 9.8% of the population 14​
​ .
Policlinico San Pietro represents a hospital with 300 beds, located in the province of

Bergamo. It was one of the firsts Italian hospitals transforming itself into a COVID-19
hospital. From March 7th to April 5th, 509 patients were hospitalized in the medicine
department, almost all for bilateral interstitial pneumonia due to suspicion or confirmed
COVID-19. To manage this number of patients, medical and intensive-care beds have been
implemented, suspending all non-life-saving clinical activities. In our institute the elective
surgical activity was suspended after the session of March 6th due to COVID-19 emergency;
only urgent-emerging and life-saving surgery was active. The aim of this study was to
evaluate how the emergency department and urgent surgical activity changed during the
COVID-19 pandemic first month in a medium-sized hospital in a critical area.

MATERIAL AND METHODS:
In our institute the elective surgical activity was suspended after the session of March 6th due
to COVID-19 emergency, we considered the period between March 7th and April 5th. In our
emergency department, 30,537 people are evaluated every year (mean number of access in
2011-2019), about 84 patients per day. In our emergency department, patients are divided in
two groups (medical and surgical patients) according to the suspected diagnosis at the
entrance. If the suspected diagnosis is internalistic, cardiological or neurological, the patient
is referred to the medical emergency room (ER) while if the suspected diagnosis refers to
general surgery, orthopedics, traumatology, urology, neurosurgery, otolaryngology or
ophthalmology is directed to the surgical ER. Patients are first evaluated at the check-in desk
(Triage) and a color is assigned in accordance with the level of priority, clinical conditions
and vital signs: RED for life-threatening conditions, YELLOW for potentially critical
conditions, GREEN for minor injuries or illnesses, or WHITE for non-urgent conditions. We

analyzed data from the first 30 days from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in our
hospital (San Pietro Polyclinic, Bergamo, Italy). Two authors (EP and GB) independently
searched for numbers of emergency department access and classification by color in the
period between March 7th and April 5th. Data on the last 10 years (from 2011 to 2020) were
analyzed. The hospitalization criteria and the criteria for surgery intervention adopted during
COVID-19 emergency are the same as those used in previous years. The admissions in
surgical and medical ward from the emergency department and the number of urgent surgical
operations were also assessed. In the evaluation of urgent surgical operations, only patients
from ER were considered; reoperations after elective surgery, trauma and deferred
emergencies were excluded. Local Ethical Committees review of the protocol deemed that
formal approval was not required owing to the retrospective, observational, and anonymous
nature of this study. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (Statistical
Package for Social Science).

RESULTS:
From March 7th to April 5th, 2020, during COVID-19 Pandemic 1191 patients presented to
our emergency department (mean 39.7 pts/days). We observe 53% access reduction when
compared with the corresponding period of previous years (mean number of admission to
emergency department was 2534, 84.4 pts/days). Figure 1a. If the number of medical
admissions was similar to the mean of the past nine years (904 patients in 2020 vs 896
patients in the period of 2011-2019; 30.1 vs 29.9 pts/days), we observed a drastic reduction of
surgical patients. From March 7th to April 5th, 2011-2019, the mean number of admission in
surgical ER was 1638 vs only 287 of 2020 with 82.5% reduction (54.6 vs 9.6 pts/days).

accordance with the level of priority, clinical conditions and vital signs we notice a reduction
of white and green-code patients (respectively -80.6% and -72.9%) when compared with the
mean of the previous period; the number of yellow-code patients was similar 579 vs 614
(-5.8%) ​and there was an increase of critical red-code patients 101 vs 22 (+359%), Table 1.
In the 30 days analyzed in 2020, we experienced a reduction in minor accesses in medical ER
(-100% white-codes, -38.3% green-codes) and an increase in severe cases (+43.2%
yellow-codes, +405.3% red-codes) when compared with the corresponding period of
2011-2019 (table 1). In the surgical emergency room, we observed a reduction in all the
codes excluding the red ones (- 75% white-codes, -86,7% green-codes, -64.7% yellow-codes
and +78.6% red-codes). Thirteen of the 287 patients evaluated in surgical ER needed
hospitalization in the general surgery ward. The mean hospitalization from surgical ER in the
same period of 2011-2019 was 45 patients with 71.2% reducti​on. Figure 1c. Despite we
suffered a reduction in admission to the general surgery department, in the period between
March 7th and April 5th, 2020, 4.5% of patients evaluated in the surgical ER compared to a
mean of 2.77% in 2011-2019 same period were hospitalized in general surgery. W​e observed
a significant increase in hospitalizations in the medical department (+359%) with 509
hospitalizations in 2020 vs an mean of 111 in previous years (figure 1d).
From ​March 7th to April 5th, 2020, we perform six urgent surgical operations: one patient
underwent cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis, one appendicectomy was performed for
perforated appendicitis, two patients underwent hernia repair for incarcerated hernia and two
colonic resections were performed (one for colonic ischemia and the other for diverticular
perforation) (Table 2). ​When we analyze ​urgent-emergent surgical operations from March 7th
to April 5th, 2011-2019, we exclude reoperation after elective surgery, trauma and deferred
emergencies and consider only patients from ER. We notice a 47.5% reduction of

urgent-emergent surgery when compared 2020 with the period from 2011 to 2019. For
pathologies where conservative antibiotic treatment is possible (cholecystitis and
appendicitis) the reduction was 60% while for the other pathologies the reduction was 37.9%.

DISCUSSION:
SARS-CoV2 disease has spread so suddenly and severely that it has stressed Italian health
system, in particular the Lombard one, that had taken extraordinary measures to address the
constant patients increase in medical departments 15​
​ , as our data show in table 1. These
measures took place on two fronts: protection of healthcare personnel to avoid intra-hospital
COVID-19 diffusion (supply of Personal Protective Equipment, body temperature check
before each work shift, nasal swab in case of symptoms even mild) and creation of
COVID-dedicated beds. All departments blocked the elective activity to be able to meet the
beds demand from medical ER, which in our center were about 3.5-fold greater than in the
same period in the years 2011-2019. In particular, in the general surgery department most
patients, when clinically feasible, were discharged; all the elective surgery was suspended,
and the operating rooms were transformed into intensive-care beds; the number of attending
surgeons on the ward has reduced to cover work shifts in the emergency room and medical
department. Only 1 on 6 operating rooms was maintained for eventual emergent/urgent
surgery. Most of the Lombardy hospitals were mainly dedicated to coronavirus patients. The
Lombardy Region has identified 18 HUBs, hospitals reserved for major trauma, heart attacks,
strokes and other emergencies. All other hospitals, including ours have been classified as
SPOKE intended for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, especially intensive-care units.
Therefore, we decided not to include in our population the patients that in the period between
2011-2019 had been classified as trauma, to minimize the selection bias. During the 30 days

taken into consideration, there have been deep changes in ER access, we have seen a
reduction in minor codes, white and green, by 80.6% and 72.9% respectively, with a
substantial stability of the yellow codes (-5.8%) and red codes increase of 359%. Even more
interesting was the evaluation of ER access investigating medical and surgical area
separately. Surgical ER underwent to reduction of approximately 83% in the total amount of
accesses, in detail -75%, -86.7 and -64.7% respectively for white, green and yellow codes; on
the other hand, the data on red codes seem to go against the trend, showing +78.6% raise;
obviously the number is small to have an effective estimate of the real increase. This access
codes redistribution could be explained by general practitioners trying conservative treatment
at home and patients’ more expected attitude for fear of infection in overcrowded ER. During
the 30 days in the study, medical ER was deeply stressed (table 1), not for an overall
admission increase that was substantially stable (+0.9%), indeed we observed a drastic
reduction for minimal injuries patients (-100% white codes, -38.3% green codes), a notable
increase of significant clinical conditions (+43.2% yellow codes) and a dramatic expansion of
patients with life-threatening conditions (+405.3% red codes). If the Health Minister
ordinance to stay at home and contact general practitioners if flu symptoms and fever (up to
37.5°C) are present to avoid ER overcrowding, could explain the reduction of minor codes;
the severity and rapid onset of COVID-19 symptoms may justify the raise of critical
conditions. Of course, this change in the type of access (medical vs surgical) and in the
distribution of codes with a shift to the major codes leads accordingly to a greater number of
admissions in medical ward, approximately 360% increase (table 1); to meet this demand, the
departments suspended their elective activities; on the other hand, due to reduced access to
surgical ER, admissions to emergency surgery decreased by 71.2%, indeed the reduction in
surgical activity was much greater, considering also elective activity suspension. In this

scenario, the impact was also on emergency surgeries that overall had a drop of 47.5% (table
2); however, there is a significant difference in the reduction of interventions depending on
pathologies taken into consideration; in fact, for pathologies where a conservative approach is
not viable, the surgery number has remained almost stable, while pathologies with possible
conservative treatment have 60% decrease. In this dramatic situation our approach has been
to attempt conservative treatment where possible and to reschedule the subsequent surgery in
a elective regime to avoid prolonged hospitalization with relative infectious consequences.
Appendicitis and cholecystitis in which conservative treatment is possible, the surgery has
decreased by 70% and 40% respectively; for these illnesses often due to an infection,
according to guidelines 16​
​ , conservative treatment with antibiotic therapy is safe and feasible,
even at home in selected cases; for cholecystitis, another therapeutic option is
cholecystostomy, which has proven to be a valid alternative to cholecystectomy in fragile
patients who are not responsive to the antibiotic 17​
​ . Incarcerated/strangulated hernia and
bowel obstruction/perforation don’t seem to have reduction or increase, unfortunately
population is to small to perform reliable statistics analysis, because these conditions cause a
a life-threatening condition that needs emergency surgery, in fact conservative treatment is
often not conclusive for these patients 18–20​
​ . When surgery could not be postponed, measures
were taken during hospital stay to avoid any intra-hospital infection even in patients without
respiratory symptoms 21,22​
​ : hospitalization in covid free wards, patients’ use of a mask,
isolation in the room, healthcare personnel Personal Protective Equipment use.

CONCLUSION:
The result of COVID-19 pandemic on Italian healthcare has been dramatic, we analyzed the
first 30-days of pandemic in a medium-size Lombard hospital. Our results show the rise of

critical medical ER accesses and the significant expansion in hospitalisation in the medical
department with the necessary hospital reorganisation to face COVID-19 emergency. We also
observed a reduction in both surgical ER accesses and urgent surgical activity, with
conservative management as the first option where feasible. However, the number of
pathologies where an emergency surgical approach is necessary has not decreased
significantly compared to previous years. In the first 30-days of COVID-19 pandemic,
despite the overall ER access was stable when compared with previous years, it was stressed
due to an significantly increase of patients with critical and life-threatening conditions
associated with a drastic minor-code patients reduction.
