Abstract
COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease. Studies suggest that its severity is amplified in patients diagnosed with Diabetes
Mellitus. In this study, the correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and Diabetes was analyzed at the regional and
global scale using data extracted from WHO and IDF Diabetes Atlas. For the regional investigation data was assorted into ten
regions including Central Asia, Middle east and western Asia, Africa, North America and the Caribbean, South east Asia, East
Asia, Europe, South and Central America, South Asia and Oceania. The results show a positive correlation coefficient of 0.47
in Middle east and western Asia. While at the global scale analysis all the selected countries were considered together and a
correlation coefficient of 0.32 was observed. This number was increased to 0.69 when the top most affected countries by
COVID-19 were considered for the analysis. In order to investigate the time dependent relationship of the two diseases, the data
was analysed in five windows of 45 days each since the beginning of pandemic. The results show an increasing pattern of the
correlation coefficient in the last three windows. Overall, based on this study by increasing the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus,
the prevalence of COVID-19 cases may also increase.

1. Introduction
Following the occurrence of atypical pneumonia in
Wuhan China, and subsequently in Thailand, Japan,
South Korea, and eventually the rest of the world, a
pandemic was announced by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on 11th of March 2020. The first
infected human cases were reported on December 19th
2019 [1]. The disease was extensively spread around

the world and to this date more than 40 million cases
of COVID-19 have been reported and over 1.1 million
patients have died.
This is the third pandemic caused by beta
coronaviruses in the last two decades; the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARSCoV-1) emerged in 2002, with a mortality rate of 10%
and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2012 with a
mortality rate of 35% [2, 3].The coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Acute Respiratory

Biostatistical Investigation of Correlation Between COVID-19 and Diabetes Mellitus

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the origin of
which is believed to be bats as the primary hosts [4]
and the Malayan pangolin as the intermediate host [5].
The virus is extremely successful in hijacking the
human cells and presents a high infection rate.
Social distancing, home quarantines, and travel
restrictions are the main strategies in the management
of the disease. Due to the uneven spread of COVID-19
in countries, some countries have had higher numbers
of COVID-19 patients while others showed a much
lower prevalence.
Enormous funding has been put into making vaccines,
and researchers worldwide have been looking into
possible treatment options, but to this date, no cure has
been found yet [6]. Recent studies indicate that among
those suffering from COVID-19, patients with
diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus (DM) show higher
disease severity and risk of mortality [7-10]. This
could be due to hypertension, cardiovascular diseases,
obesity, and chronic kidney diseases often observed in
diabetic patients [11].
This study puts together all the available statistical
data to explore the relationship of DM and COVID-19
on a local and global scale. These analyses have
immediate benefits in management and treatment of
the DM patients who are affected by COVID-19.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Studied populations
Based on the World Health Organization and IDF
Atlas of Diabetes data sets, regional and accumulative
populations were chosen [12, 13]. It should be noted
that some countries were omitted due to the lack of
data. The regional populations were classified into 10
groups including; Central Asia, Middles east and
western Asia, Africa, North America and the
Caribbean, South east Asia, East Asia, Europe, South
and Central America, South Asia and Oceania.
Detailed list of the countries in each region is
mentioned in Table 1. The accumulative population
consists of all 190 countries which are mentioned in
Table 1.

2.2. Research Variables
In order to study the relationship between the number
of COVID-19 and DM patients, Variables C and D
were calculated; where C is the prevalence of COVID19 among the total population of each country
(Equation. 1) and D is the prevalence of DM in adults
(ages 20 – 79) of the total population in each country
(Equation. 2). Calculation of C and D variables was
carried out by Microsoft Excel 2016.

2.3. Data Collection
The number of adults who were diagnosed with DM
for each country was taken from IDF Diabetes Atlas
(https://www.diabetesatlas.org/en/data/). The data was
last updated 25th of November 2019.
The total population of the countries was extracted
from
Worldometers
(https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/).
The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was
taken from WHO webpage (https://covid19.who.int/).
This data was last updated on 11th of October 2020.

2.6. Statistical tests and analyses
2.4. Test of normality
The collected data for both C and D variables were
evaluated to check whether they present a normal
distribution. The normality of the data was tested using
the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality via IBM SPSS
Statistics 26 [14] which is widely used [15-18]
2.5. Calculation of the Correlation Coefficient
To assess the statistical relationship between C and D,
the correlation coefficient between the two variables,
was calculated using Minitab 19 Statistical Software
[19]. Among the studied populations, if both variables
were normally distributed, Pearson correlation
coefficient and if normality was not met for one or
both variables, Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient was calculated [20].
Notice that the correlation does not necessarily
indicate that a cause-and-effect relationship is at work.

Microsoft Excel 2016, Minitab 19 Statistical Software
[19] and IBM SPSS Statistics [14] were used to
analyse the data.

2.7. Graphs
The scatter plots were drawn using Minitab 19
Statistical Software [19]. Graphs and tables were
redesigned with Microsoft PowerPoint 2016.

2.8. Selective analysis of the countries with the highest
rate of COVID-19
For an accurate analysis of the correlation between
COVID-19 and DM, 15 countries with the highest
prevalence of COVID-19 were chosen. These
countries are as follows: Qatar, Bahrain, Aruba,
Andorra, Israel, Panama, Kuwait, Peru, Chile, Brazil,
The United States, San Marino, Oman, Maldives and
Argentina.

Biostatistical Investigation of Correlation Between COVID-19 and Diabetes Mellitus

Note that when testing the top 14 or 16 countries with
the highest prevalence of COVID-19, similar results
were observed.
2.9. Milestoning of the accumulative data
To determine the trend of C and D correlation
throughout the pandemic, the data of variable C among
the accumulative population were collected in five
milestones with a duration of 45 days each. The start
date was on 1/3/2020 and it ended on 11/10/2020.
Exact dates of each window can be found in Table 2.
Afterwards, the correlation coefficient between C and
D for each milestone was calculated using the method
mentioned in the “Normalization and Calculation of
the Correlation Coefficient between C and D” section.

3. Results
3.1. Regional correlation between variables C and D
Correlation between two variables C and D was
investigated in all regions. The results for each region
is discussed in Table 3.

3.2. Middle East and Western Asia
In this region, the correlation between the two
variables C and D was studied in 18 countries (Table
1). As shown in Table 3, the p-value is 0.049, which
indicates that the correlation coefficient of 0.47 in this
region is statistically significant. The positive
correlation coefficient indicates that when D increases,
C also increases.
3.3. Central Asia, South East Asia, North America
and the Caribbean, Africa, Oceania, East Asia,
Europe, South and Central America and South Asia
in these regions, the correlation between the two
variables C and D was studied by the assortment of the
countries according to Table 1. As shown in Table 3,
the p-values of the calculated correlation coefficients
for all of these regions are not statistically significant.

3.4. Accumulative Analysis
The correlation coefficient between C and D in all
countries investigated in this study is statistically
significant; P-Value < 0.0001. This moderately
positive correlation indicates that when D increases, C
also tends to increase. (Table 3 and Figure 1)
3.5. C and D correlation in the countries with the
highest rate of COVID-19
The correlation coefficient between C and D in the 15
countries with the highest COVID-19 rate (see
methods section) equals to 0.693 with P-Value= 0.018.
Which indicates that there is a strongly positive
correlation between the two variables (Table 3),
(Figure 1 and Figure 2).
It is worth mentioning that the reported data on the
confirmed cases of COVID-19 may not be accurate in
several countries. Hence, this analysis suggests that if
there will be sufficient statistics on the COVID-19
cases, there could be a strong positive correlation
between the two diseases.
3.6. Mile stones
The accumulative data was mile-stoned in windows of
45 days since the pandemic has started (Table 2). The
correlation between each mile stone and D variable,
indicates a significant and positive relationship in the
first, second, fourth and fifth windows (Table 4).

4. Discussion
This study explored the correlation between Diabetes
Mellitus and COVID-19 using all the available online
data until 11th of October 2020 at the local and global
scale. The results show a meaningful positive
correlation coefficient between the two diseases
globally and in the Middle East and Western Asia on
the local scale. In the countries with the highest rate of
COVID-19, the correlation coefficient between the
two diseases was found to be strongly positive and
significantly higher than those in the accumulative
study at the global scale. Overall, the results of this
work indicate that if the prevalence of Diabetes
Mellitus increases, the prevalence of COVID-19 cases
may also increase. According to the milestoning
investigation, there is an increasing pattern of the
correlation coefficient in the last three windows. This
increasing pattern was not observed in first and second
windows, due to the uneven spread of COVID-19 and
asynchronous pandemic peaks in different countries.
This study brings light to the potential treatment in
patients with a background of hyperglycemia and
diabetes and provides a foundation for further research

on the nutritional and genetics causes of the
relationship between the two diseases. These findings
must be expanded by paying utmost attention to
collection of data from patients with hyperglycemia,
DM types I and II separately and within different age
groups.
With many researchers working tirelessly, every day
we are getting closer to finding a vaccine for this
disease. By distributing this vaccine world-wide,
millions of lives will be saved. However,
understanding the relationship between Diabetes
Mellitus and COVID-19 as a viral infection will still
remain a significant topic of research that should be
expanded.
