Abstract

We describe clinical and laboratory findings in 35 consecutive patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal swab that presented one or multiple
syncopal events at disease onset. Neurological examination and electrocardiographic findings were normal.
Chest computed tomography showed findings consistent with interstitial pneumonia. Arterial blood gas
analysis showed low pO2, pCO2, and P/F ratio indicating hypocapnic hypoxemia, while patients did not
show the expected compensatory heart rate increase. Such mechanism could have led to syncope.
We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 could have caused angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor
internalization in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), thus altering the baroreflex response and inhibiting
the compensatory tachycardia during acute hypocapnic hypoxemia.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; syncope; hypocapnic hypoxemia; angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)

receptor; baroreceptor reflex.

Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in Italy
on February 19th, 2020, the Lombardy Region in Northern Italy has been one the most affected areas in
Europe. The public hospital in the town of Crema was one of the first to face the exponential influx of
patients. Thanks to the immediate adoption of available local procedures to cope with the hospitalization
of patients with a potential viral spread, based on 2009 SARS and H1N1 pandemic strategic plan revised on
December 2014 after Ebola outbreak, the Emergency Department could set up a standardized triage for
any individual either reporting or presenting with fever, cough, or dyspnea, or having had contact with
potentially Covid-19 carriers.
METHODS
Since February 21th, all consecutive suspected patients admitted to the hospital underwent a procedure
including body temperature and pulse oximetry (SO2) recording, hematological screening, chest X -ray
and/or computed tomography (CT) scan, and nasopharyngeal swab. Swabs were stored at +4°C and
immediately shipped to one of the laboratory of virology accredited by the Lombardy Region to perform
diagnostic SARS-COV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Based on the clinical,
laboratory, and radiological findings, patients were discharged to home in quarantine or admitted to the
hospital. All necessary patient consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have
been archived.
Recently, some case series have reported syncope as the first manifestation of SARS-CoV-2
infection, even in the absence of other common symptoms such as fever, cough, and dyspnea. Patients had
in common comorbidities for heart disease, coronary artery disease, post-permanent pacemaker (PPM) or
cardiac loop recorder implantation (Ebrille et al., 2020; Tape et al., 2020). We analyzed 411 consecutive
patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction at
nasopharyngeal swab among whom nearly 10% reported syncope at the onset of the infection (Benelli et
al., 2020). Herewith we describe clinical and laboratory findings in 35 consecutive patients that presented
one or multiple (9 patients; 25.7%) syncopal events at disease onset.
Syncope occurred within 3.6±2.7 days from hospital admission. Nine (25.7%) patients reported
head trauma and one subdural haemorrhage. Associated onset symptoms were fever >37.5°C in 17 (48.5%)
patients, cough in 8 (22.8%), and dyspnoea in 7 (20%). Hypertension (45.7%), dyslipidaemia (17%), renal
insufficiency, hypothyroidism, dementia, cancer (8.5%), anaemia and atrial fibrillation (5.7%) were the most

common comorbidities. Twenty-one (60%) patients reported intake of >3 drugs, 12 (34.3%) of 4-6 drugs
and 2 (5.7%) of >7 drugs. Eleven (31.4%) patients were taking beta-blockers.
The neurological examination was normal in all patients. Chest computed tomography showed
single or multiple ground-glass and/or consolidative lung opacities consistent with interstitial pneumonia in
all patients. Electrocardiogram showed corrected QT interval at rest ranging 409-511 ms (mean 451±30;
median 449.5; interquartile range 433-474), PR interval ranging 104-220 ms (mean 161±35.5; median 153;
interquartile range 136.5-195.5), and QRS complex duration ranging 66-134 ms (mean 95±18; median 93;
interquartile range 83-105.5), which were nearly within normal values. Initial arterial blood gas analysis
showed low pO2, pCO2, and P/F ratio consistent with hypocapnic hypoxemia in most patients (table 1).
However, patients did not show compensatory heart rate increase (fig. 1). Such mechanism likely underlay
the occurrence of syncope (Yasuma et al., 2000).
Cardiovascular and respiratory systems strongly interact to ensure adequate oxygen release to
tissues and organs, and the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs predominantly
regulates heart rate response. The increased compensatory tachycardia response to hypoxia induces higher
cardiac output, while stroke volume remains unchanged.
SARS-CoV-2 viral coat expresses the S protein that contains a receptor-binding region with high
affinity for the extracellular domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Binding leads to
ACE2 internalization. It has been shown that the loss of ACE2 at cell surface could precipitate existing
cardiovascular, kidney and brain diseases (South et al., 2020). The baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate
is regulated by the brain renin–angiotensin system in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of the
brainstem, where ACE2 is expressed (Doobay et al., 2007). Increased ACE2 activity in the brainstem
decreases baroreflex sensitivity and vagal tone, and increases sympathetic output and heart rate (Mukerjee
et al., 2019). Conversely, experimental injection of ACE2 antagonist in rat NTS increased sensitivity of the
baroreceptor reflex leading to bradycardia response (Diz et al., 2008).
In patients experiencing syncope, SARS-CoV-2 could have caused ACE2 internalization in the NTS,
thus altering the baroreflex response and inhibiting the compensatory increase of heart rate during acute
hypocapnic hypoxemia.
