ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to provide validated procedures allowing to detect the
SARS-CoV-2 and an internal control in a unique one-step duplex RT-qPCR. Two
internal controls were tested, targeting either the Schmallenberg virus RNA provided
by the NARILIS laboratory (University of Namur) with a HEX-labelled probe or a
Diagenode Diagnostics internal control with a Cy5-labelled probe. Our results
showed that Ct values of the RT-qPCR duplex assay were even smaller in the
optimized working conditions, allowing to use the optimized qPCR conditions in
routine diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION
A current international health crisis is shaking the world due to the new severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic infection causing the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The burden is not only on the health care
system but also on our society putting our economy at risk. Although most infected
individuals (approximately 80 %) show benign clinical signs, vulnerable and older
people can show severe symptoms [1]. Amongst the various option to reduce the
ongoing outbreak, rapid and early diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic
infected individuals are highly appreciated to rapidly quarantine the SARS-CoV-2
infected one’s or to rapidly clinically enroll patient with severe symptoms. As the
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, virology laboratories can
routinely detect with high sensitivity and specificity its viral genome present in various
clinical samples by reverse-transcriptase qualitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR). A rapid researcher solidarity allowed to share not only genomic
information (Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession number MN908947) deposed on the
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) but also in-house developed
laboratory assay protocols to detect and identify the emerged coronavirus deposed
among others on the WHO website [2, 3].
Based on their previous experiences, the team of C. Drosten together with an
European research network, published in January 2020 a validated diagnosis
workflow to detect the SARS-CoV1 [4]. Using Taqman probes in reversetranscriptase - quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), detection of the
envelop protein (E) sequence allowed for a highly sensitive pan-coronavirus
detection tool, with an analytical sensitivity of up to 3.2 viral RNA copies per reaction,

while detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RnRP) sequence targeted
more specifically the new SARS-CoV-2 genome [4].
In the absence of physical sources of positive control SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequence, quality controls of the clinical laboratory assays rely on documentation of
their analytical qualification and validation.
The impressive ongoing deployment of laboratory assay capacity by coordinated
action of academic, public and private laboratories is however highly dependent of
reagent availability. Indeed rapid lacks of specific commercial kits seriously impeded
clinical laboratory diagnosis capacity. Rapidly, the additional support of fundamental
research laboratories allowed to develop quality controlled diagnosis workflows. In
Belgium, a veterinary research unit of the University of Namur (NARILIS) developed
and provides an internal control, RNA extract containing Schmallenberg virus RNA
genome, for each RT-qPCR reaction [5]. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR are consequently
only validated when a parallel RT-qPCR targeting the Schmallenberg virus RNA
genome show positive results. Similar internal controls are also commercially
available. Those controls allow to assess nucleic acid extraction quality and to verify
the absence of PCR inhibitor or process error. Although their sequences have no
similarities with the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, they are usually performed in time and
reagent consuming parallel Taqman RT-qPCR assays, further increasing the risk of
detection kit and reagent shortage [5].
The aim of this study was to provide validated procedures allowing to detect the
SARS-CoV-2 and an internal control in a unique one-step duplex RT-qPCR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimen collection
Nasopharyngeal swabs (N=15 ) were obtained during the March 2020 and May 2020
from patients requiring SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology screening test from the
Clinical Microbiology laboratory of the Hospital Princesse Paola of Marche-enFamenne (IFAC– VIVALIA).

RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from the clinical samples by the QIAamp Virus Pathogen Midi Kit
on a QIASymphony automate (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) using manufacturer’s
intructions. Before RNA extraction procedure, an internal control was added to the
clinical samples, consisting either in 5 μL Schmallenberg virus RNA extract or in 10
μL Cy5 (DRIC-CY-L100) RNA control.

Real-time reverse transcription PCR
Reactions to detect SARS-CoV-2 E sequence were performed in 25 μL as described
by Coupeau et al . [5]. Briefly, a 25 μL reaction contained RNAse free water, 5 μL 5X
concentrated reaction master mix containing DNA polymerase, MgCl2 and dNTP
(Eurogentec Takyon One-Step No Rox Probe 5X MasterMix dTTP), 0.25 μL
Euroscript II reverse transcriptase and RNAse inhibitor and 0.25 μL additive (both
provided with the Eurogentec Takyon 5X MasterMix), 5 μL RNA and various
concentration of primers and probes. In singleplex assays, primers and probes

(targeting either the SARS-CoV-2 E or the Schmallenberg virus RNA) were at 400
nM and 200 nM final concentration, respectively, as previously described [5]. In
duplex assays, the working concentration of primers and probe targeting the SARSCoV-2 E sequence were at 100 nM and 50 nM, respectively, and the working
concentration of primers and probe targeting the Schmallenberg virus RNA internal
control were at 200 nM and 100 nM, respectively. Alternatively, when we used the
Cy5 internal control of Diagenode Diagnostics (Seraing, Belgium), 0.5 μL of RNA
internal control targeting Cy5 primers and probe (DICR-CY-L100) were included in
the 25 μL reaction. Thermocycler reactions were performed in the Rotor-Gene Q
(QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the following program : 10 min. 48°C, 95°C
3 min. followed by 45 cycles of 15 sec. at 95°C and 30 sec. at 58°C, as previously
described. Fluorescence were measured at 510 nm and 555 nm when using
Schmallenberg virus RNA internal control and additionally at 660 nm when using
Diagenode Diagnosis Cy5 internal control.
Statistical analysis
The independent t student test for paired samples was used to verify the significance
between the various Ct values obtained for same RNA samples in three RT-qPCR
methods, and using the singleplex RT-qPCR as reference. This was performed using
the Graphpad tools available on https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest2/.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to reduce time and reagent consumption, we worked to achieve the best
qPCR reaction conditions allowing to detect SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples in
a duplex one-step RT-qPCR (testing various master mixes and various primer and
probe concentrations). This was performed using residues of various positive sample
RNA extracts remaining after the routine singlexplex one-step RT-qPCR. The most
satisfying conditions were further validated using fifteen new RNA samples among
the various RNA specimens collected for suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection using
nasopharyngeal swabs. They were selected to be part of one of the 3 subgroups
containing 5 RNA samples (Ct25, Ct30 or Ct35) based on a singleplex one-step RTqPCR Ct result being around 25, 30 or 35, respectively. The mean of the Ct values
obtained by the singleplex one-step RT-qPCR for these positive specimens were
25.01, 30.36 and 36.47 for the FAM SARS-CoV-2 probe

(Figure 1). Using the

conditions described under “Materials and Methods”, we obtained satisfying Ct value
means for the FAM SARS-CoV-2 probe in the duplex one-step RT-qPCR using the
Schmallenberg virus RNA extract as internal control (24.43, 29.57, 37.33,
respectively) or using the Cy5 Diagenode Diagnosis internal control (24.99, 30.04,
34.16, respectively) (Figure 1). Statistical analysis of the Ct value means showed that
the Ct values obtained in the duplex one-step RT-qPCR with the Cy5 Diagenode
Diagnosis internal control were particularly satisfying to detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in samples with low viral load. Indeed, for Ct around 35, the p value in the
independent t student test for paired samples was significatively different with a p
value of 0.0315, a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.3353 to 4.2967 and a
standard error of difference (SED) of 0.713. In case of higher viral load (Ct values
around 25 or 30), the duplex one-step RT-qPCR with the Cy5 Diagenode Diagnosis

internal control performed similarly to the simplex RT-qPCR (for samples with Ct
around 25, the p= 0.8299, 95% CI is -0.2000 to 0.2360 and the SED is 0.138; for
samples with Ct around 30, the p= 0.0716, 95% CI is -0.0452 to 0.6892 and the SED
is 0.132) suggesting that the duplex one-step RT-qPCR with the Cy5 Diagenode
Diagnosis internal control could be used in order to reduce time and reagent
consumption.

When

with

the

Schmallenberg virus RNA extract as internal control, although this duplex one-step
RT-qPCR could statistically perform better when using high viral load (for Ct around
25, the p = 0.0006, 95% CI is 0.4114 to 0.7406 and SED is 0.059; for Ct around 30,
the p = 0.0046, 95% CI is 0.4058 to 1.1702 and the SED is 0.138), the Ct value
difference were quite reduced. Considering that in the presence of low viral load the
duplex one-step RT-qPCR with the Schmallenberg virus RNA extract as internal
control could also perform as the singleplex (p = 0.5024, 95%CI = -4.0931 to 2.3771,
SED = 1.165), the one-step RT-qPCR could be perform in duplex to save time and
reagents.
