Abstract
Background
Remote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have potential to be
severely impacted by COVID-19, with multiple factors predisposing to increased
transmission and disease severity. Our modelling aims to inform optimal public health
responses.

Methods
An individual-based simulation model represented communities ranging from 100 to 3,500
people, comprised of large interconnected households. A range of strategies for case finding,
quarantining of contacts, testing, and lockdown were examined, following the silent
introduction of a case.

Results
Multiple secondary infections are likely present by the time the first case is identified.
Quarantine of close contacts, defined by extended household membership, can reduce peak
infection prevalence from 60-70% to around 10%, but subsequent waves may occur when
community mixing resumes. Exit testing significantly reduces ongoing transmission.
Concurrent lockdown of non-quarantined households for 14 days is highly effective for
epidemic control and reduces overall testing requirements; peak prevalence of the initial
outbreak can be constrained to less than 5%, and the final community attack rate to less than
10% in modelled scenarios. Lockdown also mitigates the effect of a delay in the initial
response. Compliance with lockdown must be at least 80-90%, however, or epidemic control
will be lost.

Conclusions
A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak will spread rapidly in remote communities. Prompt case detection
with quarantining of extended-household contacts and a 14-day lockdown for all other
residents, combined with exit testing for all, is the most effective strategy for rapid
containment. Compliance is crucial, underscoring the need for community supported,
culturally sensitive responses.

Background
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality
worldwide, disproportionately affecting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups such as those
of lower socio-economic status, or with comorbidities [1]. Protecting such groups must be a
priority. As of mid-2020, Australia was in a favourable position until a resurgence of cases in
Melbourne highlighted ongoing susceptibility to outbreaks [2]. A city-wide lockdown has
followed, with strict lockdowns imposed on several crowded public housing complexes. No
cases of community transmission have yet occurred in remote Australian Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander communities.
Within Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples (hereafter respectfully
referred to as ‘Aboriginal’) are significantly more vulnerable to severe COVID-19, due to a
high prevalence of comorbidities associated with severe clinical outcomes [3]. The incidence
of chronic respiratory diseases is 1.2 times higher than for non-Aboriginal Australians, type 2
diabetes 3.3 times higher, and chronic kidney disease 3.7 times higher [4]. SARS-CoV-2
transmission is likely to be more intense within remote communities due to crowded housing,
larger family sizes, inadequate hygiene facilities, and residence across multiple dwellings (47). These communities are also further from specialist health services, with SARS-CoV-2
tests needing to be transported resulting in delays. Previous influenza outbreaks in these
communities have underscored their vulnerability. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, hospital
and ICU admissions for Aboriginal people were 12 and 5 times higher, respectively, than for
non-Aboriginal Australians [5]. Similarly, First Nations Americans of the Navajo Nation
have suffered the highest rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, with case fatality rates
more than triple that of Australia overall [6]. The consequences of overcrowding and
disadvantage have been demonstrated in Singapore, where migrant workers in overcrowded
dormitories suffered from infection rates of up to 20% [7].

In Australia, protection of remote Aboriginal communities was prioritised early, including
establishment of strict movement controls in consultation with communities, within
designated biosecurity zones [8]. A national advisory body, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Advisory Group on COVID-19 (the IAG), co-chaired by the Department of Health
and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, provides evidencebased and culturally safe guidance for COVID-19 preparedness and response to the
government and other key stakeholders, with a view to locally led adaptation within each
community [9]. This group liaises with peak national health advisory bodies on COVID-19
and commissioned the work that we present here to help inform optimal public health
response strategies in remote settings.

Methods
We compare plausibly implementable strategies in a remote Aboriginal community,
examining the impact of alternative scenarios in an outbreak response, including: initial
delays with testing; differing definitions of case-contacts and consequent quarantine
strategies; community-wide lockdowns; and exit testing strategies.
Participatory approach
A participatory approach was employed throughout this study. All of the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak response scenarios explored were designed through iterative engagement between
the academic investigators, the IAG, and other public health end-users to ensure cultural
sensitivity, and to maximise the relevance and uptake of findings.
Population assumptions
An individual-based model, repurposed from a framework developed to examine dynamics of
sexually transmitted infections in remote Australia, is used to explicitly represent each
community member [10]. Community sizes comprising 100, 500, 1,000 or 3,500 people are

modelled, with results presented here focusing on communities of 1,000 people but noting
key differences.
We adopt the population household structure described by Chisholm et al.[11], whereby
individuals have family connections across multiple dwellings. Each person’s time at home is
distributed between a main dwelling (core) 66% of the time, second dwelling (regular) 23%,
and third dwelling (on/off) 9%. The remaining 2% is spent at a randomly allocated dwelling.
The frequency of contact, and therefore likelihood of transmission, is higher between
individuals within the same dwellings. Section 3 (Appendix) provides a summary of
household distribution and contact rates.
Epidemic assumptions
The disease model follows a susceptible, infectious, recovered paradigm (see Figure 1). We
assume infectiousness commences 48 hours prior to symptom onset on average [12] and
ceases with symptom resolution. Table A-1 of the appendix summarises key transmission
parameters. The basic reproduction number R0 was calibrated to centre around 5, based on
similar contexts [13-15] and allowing for enhanced mixing anticipated in overcrowded
households [16-18] (Section 2 of appendix). We conservatively assume that only half of
infected patients will self-present for testing, due either to minimal/no symptoms, fear, or
stigma.

Figure 1: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered Model Assumptions. After exposure to SARS-CoV-2 a proportion of susceptible
individuals become infected, entering the incubation phase before proceeding to the disease phase. 50% of individuals in the
disease phase are assumed to spontaneously present to clinical services, the ‘presenting proportion’. The remaining ‘nonpresenting proportion’ (those with few or no symptoms or who avoid health services due to fear or stigma) will only be
identified through active case finding and testing efforts as part of the public health response. We assume infectiousness
commences 48 hours prior to onset of symptoms (if they occur) and persists until resolution of symptoms. While we do not
explicitly split out asymptomatics from the non-presenting proportion, we conservatively assume that they are as infectious
as individuals with symptoms.

Intervention assumptions
The impact of a multi-layered public health response is assessed following identification of
the index case. Cases (those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2) are assumed to be isolated
immediately and effectively. Contacts of cases, as variously defined below, are quarantined
alone and assumed to be completely separated from others.
1. Contact definitions and quarantine
Two broad strategies for contact definition are assessed as per Figure 2. For household-based,
we define immediate household contacts as those who share the same dwelling at the time of
tracing; extended household contacts are those who share other dwellings a case may inhabit.
For history-based contact tracing, contacts are those identified over the prior 2 days (close
and casual).

Figure 2: Definitions of contacts. Household-based contacts include the index case’s immediate and extended households
defined by dwelling. History-based contact tracing relies on active contact tracing for the preceding 2 days, including
household (close) contacts and community (casual) contacts.

2. Lockdown of community
Concurrent with the quarantining of contacts, the impact of a 14-day lockdown of all
households within a community is modelled. Under lockdown, individuals remain in their
core dwelling and can mix with other residents, but not with other households or the wider
community. The effect of non-compliance is assessed.
3. Testing
Initial testing of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 occurs following clinical presentation, or after
identification as a contact. We assume a 2-day delay between taking the test and the public
health response being initiated due to logistical factors. We also assume 100% test sensitivity.
The impact of subsequent testing is examined for various scenarios:
•

Entry testing of all contacts when commencing quarantine

•

Clearance testing prior to release from quarantine for all contacts (on day 12 of 14,
assuming a 2-day delay)

•

Clearance testing prior to release from isolation for all cases (on day 8 of 10,
assuming a 2-day delay)

•

Clearance testing prior to release from lockdown

Positive tests at any point are treated as new cases, triggering a further round of contact
tracing with subsequent isolation and quarantine (+/- lockdown).

Results
Impact of delays to case finding
We assume a scenario in which an initial case enters the community while pre-symptomatic
and is detected only on subsequent self-presentation and testing. The number of infected
individuals likely present in the community by the time the first case is identified is
summarised in Table 1. Projections for multiple initial cases being identified are also shown.
Figure A-2 (Appendix) summarises projected numbers if a lower proportion of cases selfpresent to health services.

Impact of definition of contacts, and quarantine strategies
In the absence of entry and clearance testing, the extended household-based contact tracing
and quarantine strategy results in a peak infection prevalence of approximately 40%, versus
50% for the history-based quarantine strategy (Figure 3, upper panels). The addition of entry
testing to quarantine reduces the peak infection prevalence for the extended household-based
strategy to approximately 10%, versus 40% for the history-based strategy (middle panels).
Adding both entry and clearance testing results in a small additional benefit to the extended
household strategy (largely in the reduction of outbreak duration), but no significant benefit
to the history-based strategy.

The impact of clearance testing with various quarantine strategies on total infection numbers
(i.e. not just peak prevalence) is greatest for the extended household approach (Table 2). In
all other strategies, more than 90% of the community are ultimately infected, with or without

testing. For extended household quarantine without clearance testing, 83% are infected,
∼87,000 person-days spent in quarantine and >4000 tests performed. The addition of
clearance testing results in ∼66% being infected, fewer person-days in quarantine (∼51,000)
but more tests (13,551), making it the most effective strategy.

Table 2: Impact of clearance testing on contact tracing and quarantine strategies for a community of 1,000 people. Size of
outbreak (total cumulative infections), quarantine person-days (per 1,000 population), and total tests performed during
outbreak are shown. Medians are reported, with interquartile ranges (in brackets) from 100 simulations. Note that
‘infections’ refers to all individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (whether tested and known to health services or not),
whereas ‘cases’ refers to those with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have tested positive, i.e. have been identified.

Impact of community lockdown
Building on the extended-household quarantine strategy, the impact of lockdown on all
remaining households (i.e. non-quarantined households) is shown to reduce both epidemic
peak and duration – particularly if clearance testing is undertaken (Figure 4). Clearance
testing from quarantine and lockdown is the most effective strategy to avert subsequent
waves of infection in the community (green line). Entry testing is assumed for all these
scenarios.

Figure 4: Impact of community lockdown on the extended household-based quarantine strategy, for a community of 1,000
people. The panel at left shows epidemic curves for the non-lockdown scenario (a composite of outputs from Figure 3), with
and without clearance tests from quarantine. The panel at right shows these scenarios with lockdown. Entry testing is
assumed for all individuals. Lines represent the median value and shaded areas the interquartile ranges from 100 simulations.

Lockdown with clearance testing is also the most effective strategy to reduce total cumulative
infections, when applied alongside the extended household quarantine strategy with clearance
testing (Table 3). Without any clearance testing (top row), lockdown alone has little impact
on total infections (>800), quarantine person-days (>85,000), or tests (∼4,000). Adding
clearance testing to quarantine only (middle row) results in fewer infections with lockdown
added (89 versus 655), similar quarantine person-days (∼5,000), and far fewer tests (1,402
versus 13,551). Undertaking clearance testing for both lockdown and quarantine (bottom
row) results in only 35 infections in total, fewer quarantine person-days, and ∼2,500 tests –
the optimal strategy.

and total tests performed during outbreak are shown. Figures are medians, with interquartile ranges.

Impact of lockdown on delays with intervention
The effect of delays between the identification of cases and implementation of interventions
is mitigated by the addition of lockdown (Figure 5). For the extended household quarantine
scenario, increasing the delay from 2 to 4 days in the absence of a lockdown, causes infection
prevalence to increase from <10% to ∼25%, and to ∼45% with a 6-day delay (left panel). The

addition of lockdown results in a peak prevalence of <15%, even with a 6-day delay to

Loss of epidemic control occurs even in the optimal strategy (lockdown alongside the

for individuals with lockdown falls below 80% (Figure 6).

For small communities of 100, lockdown has little additional impact as most are already
quarantined due to extended household membership (Figure 7). For communities of 500,
lockdown reduces peak prevalence from ∼10% under the extended household quarantine
strategy to ∼5%. Greatest benefit is seen in very large communities (3,500), where peak
prevalence is reduced from ∼10% to less than 1%, and subsequent waves of infection are
suppressed.

Discussion
Prompt case finding is essential to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a remote Aboriginal
community. A high transmission propensity, due to interconnected and often crowded
households, means that in an unmitigated scenario the majority of the community would be
rapidly infected. By the time early cases are identified, active infections in the community
may be up to ten-fold higher. We assume only half of all infected patients will self-present to
health services for testing, due to absent or minimal symptoms, fear, or stigma. This may be
an overestimate, but evidence that pre-symptomatic transmission may contribute >40% of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission exists [12, 19]. This non-presenting proportion may not be

detected using a passive case finding approach, although a high prevalence of other comorbidities may result in non-COVID related presentations resulting in ‘co-incidental’ case
detection. Higher non-presenting proportions would lead to poorer mitigation in all scenarios,
and vice versa (see Appendix).
Of the contact tracing strategies, quarantining extended household members (residents of all
dwellings used by the case) is the most effective strategy for constraining the initial outbreak,
reducing peak prevalence from 60-70% to ~10% (Figure 3). However, large numbers of
people must be quarantined for extended periods and infections may resurge when
community mixing resumes, with overall community attack rates exceeding 80% (Table 3).
Clearance testing modestly reduces this attack rate to 65%. Lockdown of all non-quarantined
households for 14 days, concurrent with this quarantine strategy, results in the greatest
likelihood of definitive outbreak control. Peak prevalence of the initial outbreak is less than
5%, and the overall attack rate less than 10%. Clearance testing from lockdown further
improves control, preventing subsequent waves of infection due to undetected infections
being released (Figure 4): overall infections are constrained to <5% with clearance testing,
versus >80% without. This strategy also requires fewer tests due to prompt suppression,
fewer person-days in quarantine, and remains effective with delays of up to 6 days (Figure 5).
Larger communities benefit most from lockdown, with the effect dampened in smaller
communities (100-500) by the large proportion already in quarantine. Compliance with
lockdown must be at least 80-90%, or epidemic control will be lost.
Our findings are consistent with recent guidelines for a ‘contain and test’ strategy developed
by Central Australian health organisations [8], which acknowledge that symptom-based case
identification will be insufficient, and endorse active case finding and lockdown with
multiple rounds of voluntary testing. Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks overseas also
support the effectiveness of lockdowns. In the Italian town of Vo, researchers concluded that

a 14-day lockdown reduced transmissibility of infections (including asymptomatic) by 8298% [20]. Lockdowns in Wuhan contributed to a significant decrease in spread [21], and an
analysis of French data suggested that over 80% of potential COVID-19 deaths were averted
by their lockdowns [22]. Recent modelling from the UK, examining the impact of delays
with testing and contact tracing, suggests that if cumulative delays exceed 3 days for these
processes, control of an outbreak is unlikely [23].
The participatory process employed between this study’s investigators, the IAG, and other
public health end users throughout, have allowed for direct feedback of our findings and
incorporation into IAG guidelines [9], and collaborative development of plain-language
messaging for health providers and community members. Prompt case finding and a rapid
public health response will be critical for effective control, with access to decentralised pointof-care testing (e.g. GeneXpert) facilitating this. Local planning and preparation should occur
in advance, and must involve community members to ensure cultural appropriateness, local
support and community control. Early patient presentation should be encouraged, and testing,
contact tracing and isolation/quarantine guidelines and facilities clarified. The extensive
public health response required to achieve best outcomes necessitates prior preparedness
planning to ensure that the significant logistical and human resources support needed can be
rapidly mobilised. Throughout an outbreak, community trust must be preserved in order to
maximise compliance; in particular, the historical context and consequent sensitivities
regarding enforced lockdowns in remote Aboriginal communities must be kept foremost in
mind in the design and implementation of such strategies.
Limitations
Our model is informed by simplifying assumptions derived from observational data regarding
population structure and mixing. Other ‘real world’ mixing opportunities (e.g. schools and
workplaces) have not been explicitly included. Assumptions regarding transmission

dynamics are derived from non-Aboriginal populations, but where possible we have erred on
the side of caution. The high R0 to which the model is calibrated is based on early estimates
from Wuhan and amplified to reflect the propensity for intense transmission in remote
households. We assume perfect sensitivity and specificity of testing throughout the infectious
period. Morbidity and mortality outcomes have not been estimated in this model, or the
anticipated demand on health resources (testing requirements aside).
We assume that cases in isolation and contacts in quarantine will have no contact with others
(i.e. will not transmit SARS-CoV-2). This may not be possible to achieve, but by
representing this ideal we assess the maximum effectiveness of these measures and
demonstrate the added value of lockdown.

Conclusions
Remote Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have the potential to be
severely impacted by COVID-19, due to factors favouring increased transmission and disease
severity. Our modelling affirms the need for early case detection, as multiple secondary
infections are likely already presents by the time an index case is identified. Quarantining of
extended household contacts, together with 14-day community-wide lockdown with
clearance testing, are the most effective strategies in limiting the outbreak.
