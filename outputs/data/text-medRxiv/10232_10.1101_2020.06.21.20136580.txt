Abstract—The reported COVID-19 cases in the USA have
crossed over 2 million, and a large number of infected cases
are undetected whose estimation can be done if country-wide
antibody testing is performed. In this work, we estimate this
undetected fraction of the population by modeling and simulation
approach. We propose a new epidemic model SIPHERD in
which three categories of infection carriers Symptomatic, Purely
Asymptomatic, and Exposed are considered with different
transmission rates that are taken dependent on the lockdown
conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is
taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first
validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for
prediction of total number of confirmed, active and death, and
daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study also
demonstrates the possibility of a second wave of the infection if
social distancing regulations are relaxed to a large extent. We
estimate that around 12.7 million people are already infected,
and in the absence of any vaccine, 17.7 million (range: 16.319.2) people, or 5.3% (range: 4.9–5.8) of the population will be
infected by when the disease spread ends in the USA. We find
the Infection to Fatality Ratio to be 0.93% (range: 0.85-1.01).

lockdown strategy, it is imperative that the prediction of the disease
spread is available to the policymakers.
COVID-19 is different from the previously known SARS (Severe
acute respiratory syndrome) infection, with features such as the
existence of purely asymptomatic cases [11] and the spread of
the infection from those as well as from the exposed ones in
the incubation period [12]. Our proposed mathematical model
incorporates the above facts for the COVID-19 epidemic. Many other
epidemiological models are proposed for the COVID-19 infection
spread [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].
In [18], Murray and his collaborators predicted the number of
hospital beds that will be needed, critical health care requirements
like ICU and ventilators based on the data of present COVID-19
patients and the total number of deaths in the United States and the
European Economic Area.
In this paper, we formulate a mathematical model, named
SIPHERD for the COVID-19 epidemic and apply it for forecasting
the number of total active and confirmed cases, daily new positive and
death cases in the USA, according to the conditions of the lockdown
and the number of tests performed per day.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The outbreak of pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
has led to more than 8 million total reported infections and 450
thousand deaths worldwide [1], and serious efforts are needed for
its containment. The Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has affected not just
the public health but made a drastic impact on the economy of the
world as well, due to the lockdown situations in many countries,
including the United States of America. In the USA, the first positive
case of COVID-19 is reported on January 20, 2020, in a man who
returned from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak was first identified,
and the first death took place in the first week of February [2].
A major control measure was announced on March 16, restricting
the gatherings of more than ten people. However, the COVID 19
spread to almost 50 states throughout the country by March-end [1],
[3]. Now, USA has become the most affected country in terms of
confirmed, active, and death cases in the world [1].
Pandemics have hit humanity many times in the past also, and
mathematical models are already available for infectious diseases
[4], [5], [6], [7]. Mathematical modeling of the epidemic has an
unavoidable role in helping the healthcare sector by predicting the
hospital requirements in advance and for setting up the critical
care systems for the patients [8] [9].Modeling and simulation can
also predict the extent of the contagious disease and helps the
administration of the nations in decision making to implement radical
control measures for its containment [10]. In order to devise the

A. Mathematical Model SIPHERD
We model the dynamics of the COVID-19 disease spread by
dividing the population into different categories, as listed below.
‚ S - fraction of the total population that is healthy and has never
caught the infection
‚ E - fraction of the total population that is exposed to infection,
transmit the infection and turn into either Symptomatic or
purely Asymptomatic, and not detected
‚ I - fraction of the total population infected by the virus that
shows symptoms and undetected
‚ P - fraction of the total population infected by the virus that
doesn’t show symptoms even after the incubation period and
undetected. These are the purely Asymptomatic cases
‚ H - fraction of the total population that are found positive in
the test and either hospitalized or quarantined
‚ R - fraction of the total population that has recovered from the
infection
‚ D - fraction of the total population that are deceased due to the
infection.
We model the dynamics of the COVID-19 disease spread by dividing
the population into different categories, as Susceptible (S), Exposed
(E), Symptomatic (I), Purely Asymptomatic (P), Hospitalized or
Quarantined (H), Recovered (R) and Deceased (D). The SIPHERD
model equations are a set of coupled ordinary differential equations
(1 to 7) for the defined entities (S,I,P,H,E,R,D). As seen in Fig.1,
the rates of transfer from one category to another are the model

As the existence of Purely Asymptomatic cases is a distinct feature
of COVID-19, and it is crucial to identify the proportion of such
cases among the total infected in order to build a realistic model. The
Diamond Princess Cruise study is the key to identify the proportion
of Asymptomatic cases as all the susceptible people onboard were
tested. The asymptomatic proportion of the infected persons onboard
the Diamond Princess Cruise is estimated in [11]. Among the 634
tested positive onboard, 328 were found asymptomatic, i.e. more than
50 percent of the confirmed cases were not showing any specific
symptoms of COVID-19. The ratio of purely Asymptomatic (P) to
total Asymptomatic (E+P) cases is reported to be 0.35, and the ratio
of purely Asymptomatic to the total infected (E+P+I) is 0.179 [11].
The above-observed ratios can be written in terms of the entities
on the Cruise (with a bar) as all the people onboard were tested,

E to S

parameters, and a set of differential equations for the entity in each
category is formed.
The probability of getting the infection is assumed uniform among
the susceptible people, although the disease spreads localized in hotspots. Therefore, even though the disease has spread very differently
in different US states, the model considers ’average effect’ for the
estimation of the infected and death cases.
We write the model equations that are independent of the
population of the country by considering the fraction of the people
in each category[19]. The various rates listed in TABLE I are the
parameters of the problem which are not known, and only possible
range is available and the initial conditions E(0), P(0) and I(0) are
also not exactly known. Some of the parameters such as rates of
infection (α, β, γ) change with time in steps, depending on the
lockdown and social distancing conditions, and probability rate of
detection (ν) changes with time depending on tests per day (TP D ).

where, tR and tD are the delay associated with the recovery and

into account this delay because the active cases are reported after
the testing and admission to healthcare or quarantine center, and the
number of recovery and death of the admitted will not immediately
follow the active or H category number. All fractions add up to unity
that can also be seen from summing the above equations.

The basic reproduction number (R0 ) can be written by observing
the inflow and outflow rates for each infectious category (E,I,P,H)
shown in Fig 1 of the manuscript. The contribution of each of these
categories for the reproduction number can be written as the ratio of
the sum of inflow rates and the sum of outflow rates multiplied by
the rate of transmission of infection of that category.

fix the proportion between ξP and ξI as 0.36 and the proportion of
initial conditions Ep0q, Ip0q and P p0q as well. In other words, out
of 136 exposed cases, after the incubation, 36 will turn to be purely
asymptomatic, and 100 will have symptoms.
The detection of the Asymptomatic and Symptomatic cases can be
taken dependent on the number of tests done per day (TP D ). For the
Symptomatic cases, the detection is more probable as the infected
person can approach for the tests and more likely to be tested. The
detection of Symptomatic is taken in two parts, a constant (ν0 ) and
another part proportional to the tests done per day. This can be written
in terms of parameters as,

Asymptomatic carriers of Coronavirus-nCoV2 do transmit the
disease. Also, the infection can be transmitted from the person who
is not showing illness during the incubation period [12]. This can
be included in the model by considering E category people and
their transmission rate α. Hospitalized and quarantined cases can
also transmit the disease, and this low rate is taken as parameter
δ. We model the transmission rate of infection change with time in
steps, depending on the conditions of the lockdown. The detection
of the Asymptomatic and Symptomatic cases is taken dependent on
the number of tests done per day (TP D ). For the Symptomatic cases,
the detection is more probable as the infected person can approach
for the tests and more likely to be tested. The transfer rate from E to
I (ξI ) is the inverse of the incubation period, whose mean is reported
5.2 days [20]. Recovery time of Symptomatic cases is taken as 14
days. The total confirmed cases are the addition of the active cases,
extinct cases, and a part of the recovered that were detected. The rate
of transmission of infection from the Asymptomatic carrier (α, γ) for
a country is typically taken higher than the Symptomatic ones (β) as
the Asymptomatic carrier may not be aware of his/her infection, and
Susceptible may not be keeping distance as no symptoms are seen.
The mortality rate (τ ) is taken differently for different countries as
it depends on the immunity and how effectively the critical patients
are taken care of by the hospitals.

B. Optimization of the Parameters
Some of the parameters namely, ω, η, ξP , ξI have fixed value as
those represent the characteristics of the disease itself. The remaining
parameters are to be obtained that generate the evolution of the

dynamical system close to the actual data. Manual tuning of the
parameters for the best fit is quite a tedious task. For this purpose,
we write a cost function in terms of the standard deviation from the
actual data and model data for the confirmed and the active cases as
the following

where, ρj are the different parameters that are to be obtained. For

where, PSI is the probability of the daily new symptomatic cases
develop severe symptoms after time a delay of tS days and were
reported as daily new cases (DNC). The net cost function is sum of
COST1 and COST2 .
A MATLAB function ’fmincon’ is used to find the minimum of
a problem depending on a set of parameters that can have upper
and lower bounds. fmincon returns the set of parameters within the
given range, which minimizes the COST function defined above.
As there could be multiple sets of parameters giving out ’good
fit’ to the real data, other physical constraints on the parameter
sets can be considered. One of them is a reasonable value of the
reproduction number. Secondly, the rate of transmission of infection
before lockdown has to be greater than after lockdown. The mortality
rate (τ ) is not optimized but rather calculated directly by the daily
number of deaths data (DND) and the active data. The mortality rate
for a particular day can be obtained as follows.

C. Numerical Implementation and Simulation
The set of coupled equations for the model for a given set of
parameters and initial values is solved numerically by dde23 solver
routine of MATLAB for ordinary differential equations with a time
lag in functions. The non-trivial part is the accurate determination
of the parameters that will mimic the situation on the ground. The
mathematical problem is to take into account the four actual data sets
of the total number of confirmed cases, active cases on a particular
day, cumulative deaths and tests done per day and find the set of
parameters that will provide the best possible match between the data
and model. The extraction of the parameters is automated so that the
model can be run on data for various countries. The minimizer of
the cost is found to obtain the optimized set of parameters that best
fit with the data available till date. The model and the optimization
scheme is implemented in MATLAB.
The parameters determined by our model are listed in TABLE II
for the countries we studied.
For USA, the rate of transmission of infection is taken to change
in three steps. This is done by plotting the total number of cases
in log scale and seeing the changes in the slopes and correlating
with the government’s regulations on social activities. As seen in
Appendix Fig.7 b, we fit the actual mortality rate in steps. It can
be seen that the mortality rate improved with time from 2.6% to
0.7% . The mortality rate is expected to improve further, as mild
cases will also be reported with more tests available. We estimate
the improvement in the mortality rate by calculating the fraction of
mild and severe cases and assuming that all mild cases are going to
recover. The probability of Symptomatic patients developing severe
symptoms (PSI ) such as breathlessness, high fever etc has definitely
approached the test and was tested in the initial phases. Data from
cases reported from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S.
territories (5) to CDC from February 12–March 16 shows that 20.7
reported cases were hospitalized [21]. COVID-NET regions show it
to be 21.4 % till April 4 [22], [23] and IHME data March 5- April

Fig. 1: Schematic of the SIPHERD Model: α, β, γ, δ are
rates of transmission of infection; ξI , ξP are rates of transfer
from exposed to Symptomatic and Asymptomatic; ω, η, σ are
recovery rates; µ, ν are detection rates, and τ is mortality rate.

4 shows that to be 20.3 % [24] [18]. The estimation of the total
infected to hospitalized is reported to be 3.6% in another study for
France [25]. Therefore, we estimate the total 17% („3.6/.21) of the
total infected develop symptoms that are not mild and are tested and
reported in the initial days. In China, this number of non-mild cases
is reported to be 19% [26]. For the first 40 days, we put a COST for
the above condition that every day, 20% (ξI ) of the exposed develop
symptoms, and 17% of them are reported as daily new cases with
an average delay of five days. It can be seen from Appendix Fig.8
d that this condition is indeed satisfied as the model curve and real
data overlap for the first few days. Later, the gap between the two
curves widens as more tests were made available and mild cases also
tested.
The projection for the total infected persons is strongly dependent
on the value of PSI , which we estimate to be 17% as discussed
above. We simulate two more situations for the PSI value 15% and
19% and plot the time dependence of the Susceptible and Extinct
cases in Appendix Fig.8.

D. Data Collection
We collected the data from the following publicly available data
sources: The total number of cases, active cases, daily new cases,
and total and daily new deaths is collected from the worldometer
[1]. Test per day data is collected from [27].Hospitalization data is
collected from [21] [22] [24].
The day on which lockdown is imposed in a country is also taken
into account as changes in the slopes of the data for confirmed cases
are observed according to it.

III. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION
We apply the SIPHERD model to South Korea and Germany for
testing the predictive capability of our model as the disease has
almost reached the end stages in these countries. We used the data
only for the first 20 and 40 days, respectively, i.e., till March 5 and
March 31, and compared the future evolution generated by the model
with the actual data, as shown in the grey region in Fig. 2a for South
Korea and in Fig.2b for Germany. Parameters extracted by the model
from the actual data for the countries studied are listed in TABLE
II.

A. Effect of Lockdown
The model, thus validated, is then applied to the existing data
of the USA for the prediction of the next 500 days, i.e., till July
2021, as shown in Fig.2c. Two scenarios are considered for lockdown
and social distancing conditions. One possible scenario is that the
conditions are kept the same, and the second one is that they are

relaxed after June 15. Test per day assumed to be increased by 10k,
which is close to the current trend and taken saturated at 1 million
for both the scenarios. The increase in the transmission rate if the
lockdown is relaxed is taken as 20% from the current value. The
recovery rate σ is taken improved after May 26, and the mortality
rate is calculated from the data and is improved in steps from initial
value 2.65% on March 1 to 0.78% on June 9 as seen in Appendix
Fig.7.b. A comparison of the two scenarios is plotted in Fig. 4b.
The projection of the ”Chris Murray” model is compared with
SIPHERD model for the total number of deaths in Fig.2d. The
prediction range of ”Chris Murray” Model can be seen large
compared to SIPHERD model.

B. Estimation of the undetected Cases
Since only symptomatic cases were tested, the detection
probability of Asymptomatic (µ) is taken zero. There can be
many parameter sets, including the probability rate of detection of

Symptomatic ν, that give a good match between the simulation
results and the actual data. It is, therefore, not possible to know
the exact number of undetected infected people merely by fitting
the model curves with the data. The value of ν is fixed by the
characteristics of the disease, which is the ratio of severe and mild
cases. Most of the COVID-19 patients show mild symptoms, and the
number of symptomatic patients that are considered severe is taken
17% of the total Symptomatic. In the initial days of the spread of the
infection, due to the lack of test availability, only severe cases were
tested. This fact can be used to get an estimate of the undetected
symptomatic cases. For illustration, out of 1000 exposed (E) cases,
20% (200) reach Symptomatic (I) category in a day as ξI “ 0.2, and
out of those after an average delay of five days, 17% (34) become
severe cases and reported as daily new cases in the initial days. This
relationship between the available real data of Daily new cases and
exposed category number in the initial days gives a constraint on the
estimated Exposed cases.

Fig. 3: Possibility of a Second Wave of Infection. a. The evolution of the undetected number of Infected in Exposed (E),
Symptomatic (I), and purely Asymptomatic (P) category with lockdown conditions kept the same. b. Model prediction for
daily new cases for USA with the increase of 10k tests per day with lockdown conditions kept the same. c, d. The evolution
of the undetected number of Infected in Exposed (E), Symptomatic (I) and purely Asymptomatic (P) category and Daily new
cases when lockdown situations relaxed after June 15 to the extent that rate of transmission of infection increases by 30%.

Application of this constraint in the model equations shows that
the peak number of undetected Symptomatic infected people go upto
1.4 million. The time evolution of the totally unknown and undetected
part of the infected categories for USA is plotted in Fig. 3a. As shown
in Fig. 4d, the total number of Susceptible can be around 313 million
by the end of this year, assuming that the conditions on lockdown and
social distancing remain the same and vaccine is not introduced. Till
June 15, 12.61 million, i.e. 3.81% of the USA population could be
infected, and this number will increase to 17.71 million people, which
is 5.35% of the total population when the infection ends according
to the model projections. This number is surprisingly close to the
estimated number by large scale antibody testing in Spain [28].

C. Second Wave Possibility
If the social distancing norms are relaxed from June 15, 2020, to
the extent that the current rate of transmission of infection increase
by 30%, then our model simulation shows that there is a possibility of

the second wave of infection spread as seen in Fig.3c,d. The number
of tests is taken increasing 10k every day for this study.
Our study finds that the infection to fatality ratio for USA could
be around 0.93 (see Appendix Fig.8 c), which is slightly higher
than reported in [25]. This could be due to a lower estimate of
the improvement in mortality rate in the coming months. The initial
reproduction number 4.8 on March 1 came down to a value of 1.2
on April 1, and to 0.8 on April 15, as seen in Appendix Fig.7 f.
The recovery rate of the Active (H) category for USA is found
to be low compared to South Korea or Germany, which may be
attributed to either incorrect reporting of the Active cases [29] or
the testing of serious cases only and lesser recovery in hospitals
compared to quarantined with mild symptoms. It can also be seen in
Appendix Fig.5 d and 6d that compared to South Korea and Germany,
the Symptomatic cases dominate the infected in USA rather than the
Exposed.

Fig. 4: Effect of increased tests and relaxed lockdown. a. Effect of increased testing on the total, active and extinct cases,
comparison of 10k and 20k increase in Tests per day (TP D ) saturated at 1 million and 2 million respectively b. Comparison of
the Total, Active and extinct cases in lockdown and relaxed lockdown situation c. Model prediction for daily new cases with
the increase of 10k tests per day with lockdown conditions relaxed after June 15 d. The evolution of the Susceptible when
lockdown situations kept same and relaxed after June 15 with tests per day increase by 10k and 20k.

D. Effect of Increase in Testing
The factor by which an increase in testing can contain the infection
is estimated for a relaxed lockdown situation. If there is 20% increase
in the rate of transmission of infection than the current value due to
this relaxation, then how fast the disease can be contained for 20k
increase in tests per day is also plotted in Fig.4a. The daily new
positive cases data and the prediction for the 10k increase in tests
per day are plotted in Fig. 4c.
We also report a couple of additional scenarios for the prediction.
If the lockdown is relaxed only for the month of June and due to
that, if there is a 20% increase in the rate of transmission of infection
than the current value, then how fast the disease will spread for 10k
increase in tests per day is also plotted in Appendix Fig.9. If the
lockdown is made stricter only for one month and if it is relaxed
after one month, the evolution can be seen in Appendix Fig.10. The
reproduction number is seen to go beyond one in the month of June
for the relaxed lockdown. The infection to fatality ratio (IFR) is
difficult to estimate during the course of the disease spread as the

entities in the model are dynamically changing with time. We make
a rough estimate by assuming that there is an average delay of 14
days between a person getting infected and becoming extinct.
The initial basic reproduction number for South Korea and
Germany turns out to be 3.18 and 3.5, respectively, and for the USA
it is 4.8. The South Korea reproduction number by our study is very
close to 3.2 reported in [30] and the USA reproduction number is
reported 4.2 on 16th March [3]. The USA basic reproduction number
appears higher than the mean reported value [31] [32]. However, the
Infection to Fatality Ratio (IFR) calculated with this high initial rate
of transmission turns out to be around 0.7% , which is close to the
reported value in [25].
A sensitivity study is carried out for the different parameters, as
seen in Appendix Fig.11 and 12. The parameters are increased and
decreased by 10% from the optimized values to see the changes in
the outcomes.

IV. C ONCLUSION
Our findings show that reported cases in the USA could only be

16.5% of the total infected by June 1. If the lockdown is relaxed
after June 15, it will lead to around 43k increase in total deaths,
and doubling the everyday increase in testing from 10k to 20k can
reduce this number by 13k. The model prediction shows that in
the absence of a vaccine, the infection can last long till the end
of this year and will infect around 5.35% of the total population,
and the number of deaths could be around 166k if lockdown and
social distancing conditions remain the same. Our simulation study
predicts the future evolution of COVID-19 in the USA for various
possible control measures in the coming months, including social
distancing conditions and the number of tests per day, and thereby
provides helpful inputs for policymakers.
