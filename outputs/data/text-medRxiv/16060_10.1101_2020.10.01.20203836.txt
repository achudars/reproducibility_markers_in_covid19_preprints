Abstract
Background: Reliable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics not requiring laboratory infrastructure could be a game changer
in the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Global South. We assessed performance, limit of detection and ease-ofuse of three antigen-detecting, rapid POC tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study recruited participants suspected to have SARS-CoV2 in Germany and the UK. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) or NP and/or oropharyngeal swabs (OP) were collected
from participants (one for clinical RT-PCR and one for Ag-RDT). Performance of each of three Ag-RDTs was compared
to RT-PCR overall, and according to predefined subcategories e.g. cycle threshold (CT)-value, days from symptoms
onset, etc. In addition, limited verification of the analytical limit-of-detection (LOD) was determined. To understand
the usability a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and ease-of-use (EoU) assessment were performed.

Results: Between April 17th and August 25th, 2020, 2417 participants were enrolled, with 70 (3.0%) testing positive by
RT-PCR. The best-performing test (SD Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q) was 76∙6% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 62∙886∙4) sensitive and 99∙3% (CI 98∙6-99∙6) specific. A sub-analysis showed all samples with RT-PCR CT-values <25 were
detectable by STANDARD Q. The test was considered easy-to-use (SUS 86/100) and suitable for POC. Bioeasy and Coris
showed specificity of 93∙1% (CI 91∙0%-94∙8%) and 95∙8% (CI 93∙4%-97∙4%), respectively, not meeting the predefined
target of ≥98%.

Conclusion: There is large variability in performance of Ag-RDT with SD Biosensor showing promise. Given the usability
at POC, this test is likely to have impact despite imperfect sensitivity; however further research and modelling are
needed.

Introduction
As of 23rd of September 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has affected the entire globe with over 30 million confirmed infections
worldwide, leading to almost one million fatalities. 1 Already early in the pandemic, the World Health Organization
(WHO) highlighted the critical importance of testing for epidemic control. 2 Reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. 3 Specialized laboratories for RT-PCR
testing are available in high-and low-resource settings.

4

However, global shortages of test reagents and limited

infrastructure and human resource capacity, have resulted in unavailability of testing or long turnaround times,
especially in the Global South. To combat transmission, fast, easy-to-use, accurate, and point-of-care (POC) diagnostic
tools are needed on a large scale.
Detection of pathogen-derived antigens on lateral flow assays is a proven concept with excellent performance, e.g.
for malaria in blood.

5

This method enables rapid, instrument-free, and low-cost POC testing. In respiratory samples,

however (e.g. for diagnosis of influenza), performance has been variable. 6
Since the onset of the pandemic, numerous companies have been working on bringing a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigendetection test (Ag-RDT) to the market. 7 Interest and funding support are substantial 8, and the USA, India and Japan,
among other countries have approved their use. 9-11 WHO has recently released interim guidance that the use of AgRDTs that meet at least 80% sensitivity and 97% specificity may be considered to diagnose active SARS-CoV-2 infection
“where nucleic acid amplification technology (NAAT) is unavailable or where prolonged turnaround times preclude
clinical testing.”.

12,13

Few peer-reviewed studies evaluating these novel assays have been published with only one

small study, to our knowledge, performed independently of the manufacturer. 14,15
Here we present a manufacturer-independent validation of three novel, antigen-detecting, rapid POC diagnostics for
SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, we performed a verification of analytical sensitivity, a large multi-centre clinical accuracy
study, and an ease-of-use (EoU)assessment. The work was conducted in partnership with the Foundation of Innovative
New Diagnostics (FIND) and has informed a WHO recommendation.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics.

Methods
Ethic statement
The study protocol was approved by the ethical review committee at the Heidelberg University Hospital for the study
sites in Heidelberg and Berlin (Registration number S-180/2020), and by the NHS review board, IRAS number 282147,
for the study in Liverpool, UK. Each participant provided written informed consent.

Tests evaluated
Three novel rapid antigen-based diagnostics were assessed:
(a) Bioeasy 2019-nCoV Ag Fluorescence Rapid Test Kit (Time-Resolved Fluorescence).

17

(Shenzhen Bioeasy

Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Guangdong Province, China; henceforth called Bioeasy), (b) COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip 18 (Coris
Bioconcept, Gembloux, Belgium; henceforth called Coris) and (c) STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test 19 (SD Biosensor, Inc.
Gyeonggi-do, Korea; henceforth called SD Biosensor).
All assays utilize the lateral flow assay principle for the detection of viral antigens. Both Coris and SD Biosensor use
colloidal gold conjugated to antibodies to enable a colour change and read-out with the naked eye, while Bioeasy uses
fluorescent readout and thus requires the use of a proprietary reader device. Coris is designed as a dipstick, whereas
Bioeasy and SD Biosensor use a cassette-based assay format. For Coris and SD Biosensor the manufacturers’
instructions for use (IFU) were followed; except for Bioeasy, the IFU was followed except the developer requested for
pipettes to be used to transfer adequate quantities of liquid (in the IFU no pipette is needed and a nozzle is provided).
17

Bioeasy and SD Biosensor include swabs within their test kits for sample collection, while for Coris, a commercially

available swab was used: the eSwab system from Copan Diagnostics (Murrieta, CA, USA), which contains 1ml of Amies
solution and was approved for use by Coris. A prespecified quantity of proprietary buffer solution was applied to the
lateral flow cassette for Bioeasy and SD Biosensor and into the test tube with the dipstick for Coris as per the respective
IFU. The readout was done within the recommended time for each Ag-RDT (10 minutes for Bioeasy, 15 minutes for
Coris and 15 to 30 minutes for SD Biosensor).

Analytical study
A limited verification of the analytical sensitivity (lower limit of detection) was performed using standardized,
quantified viral cultures.

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate REMRQ0001/Human/2020/Liverpool was propagated in Vero E6 cells (C1008; African green
monkey kidney cells). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 0∙05 mg/mL gentamycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 and FBS concentration was reduced to 4% for
viral propagation.
Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus stock starting from 1∙0 x 106 Plaque forming units (PFU)/ml were made using culture
media as a diluent (DMEM + 2% FBS % + 0∙05 mg/ml gentamycin). Two-fold dilutions were made between 1∙0 x 104 to
1∙0 x 102. Lateral flow tests were performed in triplicate. For SD Biosensor and Bioeasy, the swab included in each
individual kit was immersed into the virus dilutions and spiked (soaked). Subsequently, the test was performed using
the spiked swab following the manufacturer’s instructions. For Coris, the eSwab from Copan was spiked with serial
dilutions of virus and then added to the 1 ml of Amies solution contained in the swab tube. 100μl of each of the sample
dilutions were added to the test tube with the dipstick and was read-out as per manufacturer’s instructions.
Coris and SD Biosensor tests were read by two operators, each blinded to the result of the other. A third operator read
any discrepant tests and final result was agreed (2/3). The Bioeasy result is a digital readout, and the first operator
recorded the result, which was checked by the second operator, and printed out directly from the machine.

Clinical diagnostic accuracy study
Study design and participants
The primary objective of the clinical multicentre diagnostic accuracy study was to estimate the sensitivity and
specificity of a single antigen test compared to a single PCR test as the reference method.
Participant recruitment and sample collection was conducted at three sites: (1) A drive-in testing station in Heidelberg,
Germany; (2) a clinical ambulatory testing facility in Berlin, Germany and (3) secondary care facilities at Liverpool
University Hospital Foundation Trust, Royal and Aintree (LUHFT), Liverpool, United Kingdom. Participants screened for
the study were adults (age ≥18 years) identified as at risk for SARS CoV-2 infection according to the local department
of public health based on exposure to a SARS CoV-2 positive person, suggestive symptoms, or travel to a high risk area.
Participants were excluded if they had previously been diagnosed with SARS CoV-2 or if their command of either
English or German was insufficient to give informed consent for participation.

Study procedures
Antigen-detecting testing

After obtaining written consent, participants underwent a first swab for testing with RT-PCR, which was taken either
as (i) a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or (ii) oropharyngeal (OP) swab (if clinically contra-indicated to do a NP swab (e.g.
because of risk of bleeding)) in Heidelberg or (iii) combined as NP/OP swab in Berlin and Liverpool as per institutional
recommendations (with OP done first, followed by NP with the same swab). Subsequently, participants underwent
collection of the same type of swab again for Ag-RDT.
Ag-RDTs were performed at the sample collection site in Heidelberg and Berlin. In Liverpool samples were transported
on ice to a category 3 facility and then processed. For on-site testing, separate areas were maintained for clean
material (without sample) and ‘unclean’ areas of benches (material with sample) to avoid cross-contamination.
Disinfection was performed and gloves exchanged after each sample. Negative control testing with buffer without
sample was performed regularly to capture possible contamination. For the Ag-RDTs with visual read-out (Coris and
SD Biosensor), the results were interpreted by two operators, each blinded to the result of the other. If a discrepant
result was obtained, both operators re-read the result and agreed on a final result. Invalid results were repeated once
using the remaining buffer according to the respective IFUs.

RT-PCR testing
The swab (eSwab, Copan) for RT-PCR testing was sent to the referral laboratory in the provided Amies solution. The
RT-PCR assays were performed according to routine procedures at the referral laboratory. In Heidelberg, the SARS
CoV-2 assay from TibMolbiol (Berlin, Germany), the Allplex SARS-CoV-2 Assay from Seegene (Seoul, South Korea) or
the Abbott (Illinois, US) RealTime 2019-nCoV assay was performed. In Berlin the Roche Cobas SARS CoV-2 assay
(Pleasanton, CA United States) on the Cobas® 6800 or 8800 system or the SARS CoV-2 assay from TibMolbiol (Berlin,
Germany) was performed. In Liverpool, the Genesig® Real-Time Coronavirus COVID-19 PCR assay (Genesig, UK) was
performed. Assays were calibrated with the E-gene assay as described before. 3,19 Only samples that showed a signal
above the threshold in the relevant RT-PCR target regions for each assay were considered to be positive. Staff
performing the Ag-RDTs were blinded to results of RT-PCR tests and vice versa.
After completion of testing, the participants in Heidelberg were contacted for an interview focusing on symptoms and
co-morbidities via telephone or email according to the indicated preference on site. In Berlin and Liverpool participants
were interviewed directly on-site after obtaining the consent (questionnaire available in the supplement material
Section (B)).

All data were captured in a dedicated database utilizing Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCapTM, www.prorectredcap.org) hosted at the Heidelberg University Hospital or Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). REDCapTM
is a secure, web-based application, which provides audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures.
The protocol is provided in the supplement material Section (C).

System Usability Scale and Ease of Use Assessment
To understand the usability of the three Ag-RDTs, a standardized System Usability Scale (SUS) 20 questionnaire and a
ease-of-use assessment (EoU), specifically developed for the study, were performed. The questionnaire can be found
in the supplement material Section (D). The laboratory personnel from each study site (at least 3 operators per test)
were invited to complete the surveys separately for each assay. The complete EoU survey can be found in the
supplement material Section (D). For the interpretation of the SUS, it can be said that a SUS score above 68 would be
considered above average and anything below the score of 68 is below average. 20

Statistical Analysis
In the analytical assessment, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined as the lowest concentration for which all
three replicates scored positive.
In the clinical accuracy study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value
(NPV) of the Ag-RDTs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by comparing the Ag-RDT result to the gold
standard, RT-PCR, on the same day from the same participant (statistical analysis plan available upon request). A subanalysis was performed by CT-value. 21-23 Furthermore, a conversion of CT-values for RT-PCR tests into viral-load was
performed by calibrating the test systems using quantified specific in vitro-transcribed RNA. 24
A sample size of 1000 participants per Ag-RDT under evaluation was targeted but given the variable prevalence
throughout the pandemic this target was left flexible. Interim analyses were performed at predefined sample sizes
(25%, 50%) and an evaluation of an Ag-RDT was stopped if the predefined performance criterion for specificity (≥98%,
considering the upper bound of the confidence interval) was not met.

25

Invalid Ag-RDT results were reported

separately, whereas participants with invalid RT-PCR results were excluded from the analysis. Inter-operator variability
was assessed for tests read with the naked eye. The analysis was conducted with the statistical software R (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

For the usability assessment, the SUS score was calculated taking the mean of all answers given for each test. For the
EoU assessment, verbal answers were transferred into numerical values. Taking the mean across values, all answers
given for each test were summarized into a heat map. Both SUS and Ease of Use assessment were analysed with
Microsoft Excel.

Role of the funding source
The study was supported by FIND, Heidelberg University Hospital and Charité – University Hospital internal funds.
Pfizer funded the clinical team in Liverpool, UK. FIND provided input on the study design, and data analysis in
collaboration with the rest of the study team. The other external funders of the study had no role in study design, data
collection, or data analysis. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results
Analytical sensitivity and exclusivity
SD Biosensor was positive in all replicates at 5∙0 x 103 PFU/ml, and only one out of three replicates at 1∙0 x 103 PFU/ml,
which is approximately ten-fold higher than the supplier-reported LOD of 3∙06 x 102.2 TCID50/ml as per ATCC.org. 19
The Bioeasy assay was positive on all three replicates at 5∙0 x 103 PFU/ml (approximately 7∙14 x 103 TCID50/ml) and
only one out of three replicates at 2∙5 x 103 PFU/ml (approximately 3∙57 x 103 TCID50/ml). Coris was positive on all
three replicates at 1∙0 x 104 PFU/ml (approximately 1∙43 x 104 TCID50/ml), which is two-fold higher than the supplierreported LOD of 7∙14 x 103 TCID50/ml.

26

Coris was positive on only one of three replicates at 5∙0 x 103 PFU/ml

(approximately 7∙14 x 103 TCID50/ml).

Clinical diagnostic accuracy study
Between April 17th and August 25th 2020, 3160 participants with presumed SARS-CoV-2 infections were invited to
participate in the study. In total, 2417 met inclusion criteria, provided consent and were included in the analysis (Figure
1). Of those, 1263 participants were tested using SD Biosensor from July 20th to July 31st 2020 in Heidelberg (N=334),
from June 3rd to July 31st 2020 (N=910) in Berlin, and May 20th to June 12th 2020 (N=19) in Liverpool. Separately, 729
participants were tested using Bioeasy, 506 of whom were enrolled in Heidelberg between April 17th and May 3rd 2020,

and 223 in Berlin between May 14th and June 3rd 2020. 425 enrolled participants were tested using Coris: 286 in
Heidelberg from 11th to 25th May 2020; 105 in Berlin from 19th to 25th August 2020; and 34 in Liverpool from May 12th
to June 12th 2020. The variance in sample size is explained by the fact that both the Coris and Bioeasy evaluations were
aborted after interim analysis indicated that specificity did not meet predefined performance criteria, and after a
work-up for reasons for the false-positive results was completed.

Figure 1. Study Flow

We present clinical and demographic characteristics overall and by Ag-RDT in Table 1 (Supplement Tables 2, 3 and 4
show study characteristics by study site). The average age of participants presenting for testing was 40∙4 years
(Standard Deviation [SD] 14∙3) with 52∙8% being female and 35∙9% having comorbidities. On the day of testing, 80∙7%
of participants had one or more symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (questionnaire in the supplement material
Section (B)), with most (1868 (79∙3%)) reporting being only mildly ill and only 6 (0∙3%) stating that they are completely
bedridden due to illness (a more detailed list of symptoms and comorbidities is provided in the supplement Table 5).
Average duration of symptoms at the time of swab collection/testing was 5∙0 days (SD 9∙6 days). Of the 2407 analysed
participants, 70 (2∙9%) tested positive by RT-PCR, of which 30 (42∙9%) had CT values of <25. A description of symptoms
for all participants tested positive by RT-PCR is provided in supplement Table 5.

The best performing test among the three was SD Biosensor with a sensitivity of 76∙6% (36 out of 47 positives detected;
CI 62∙8-86∙4) and specificity of 99∙3% (CI 98∙6-99∙6) (Table 2). The sensitivity was 100% (CI 82∙4-100) for the 18 samples
with CT-values <25, while for those with CT ≥25, only 18 out of 29 scored positive (62∙1%; CI 44∙0-77∙3) (Table 3).
Corresponding viral load to CT values of RT-PCR positive results are provided in the supplement Table 6. A sub-analysis
of sensitivity of SD Biosensor by sampling strategy suggested that a NP swab alone might be less effective than a
combined NP/OP swab, however confidence intervals were overlapping (Table 4). No difference was seen by duration
of symptoms (one vs two weeks). A trend was observed for increased sensitivity by disease severity, although again
confidence intervals were overlapping (58∙8% [36∙0-78∙4], 85∙7% [65∙4-95∙0], 100% [51∙0-100] for normal activity, mild
and severe illness, respectively). No invalid results occurred. Two test results were excluded due to handling issues
(read-out after time limit). Inter-operator reliability was near perfect with a kappa of 0∙99. Overall, the usability was
considered very favourable, with a SUS score of 86/100, and the only challenges flagged by the EoU were occasional
difficulties when interpreting the test result (i.e. intensity of band; Figure 2).

Bioeasy had a sensitivity of 66∙7% (10 out of 15 detected; CI 41∙7-84∙9) and specificity of 93∙1% (49 false-positives; CI
91∙0-94∙8) (Table 2.). The sensitivity was 88∙9% (8/9 detected; CI 56∙5-99∙4) for samples with CT-values <25, while for

those with CT ≥25 only 2 out of 6 tested positive (33∙3%; CI 9∙7-70∙0). Further sub-analyses were not performed for
sensitivity because of the limited number of positive samples. Two invalid results occurred in 729 tests (0∙3%). Overall,
the usability was considered favourably with a SUS score of 73/100. The EoU identified a high number of test execution
steps (including precision pipetting) which resulted in challenges when performing multiple tests at the same time
possibly hindering the test’s wide-spread use (Figure 2).

Coris showed a sensitivity of 50% (4 out of 8; CI 21∙5-78∙5) and specificity of 95∙8% (CI 93∙4-97∙4). Two out of the three
samples with CT <25 were detected, while for the five specimens with CT ≥25, sensitivity was 40%. Further subanalyses were not performed for sensitivity because of the limited number of positive samples. The low specificity
determined the stop of the study as the upper margin of 95% CI was below 98%. Inter-operator reliability was very
good with a kappa of 0∙95. Invalid tests occurred on 8 occasions (1∙9%) either due to the control line not being visible
or due to smearing of the readout window. Four results were excluded due to handling issues (read-out after time
limit). Overall, the usability was considered unfavourable with a SUS score of 48/100 and the EoU pointed towards
challenges due to inconsistent test result interpretation (often only very faint lines visible) and deficiencies in both the
test kit quality and design (Figure 2).

An investigation of the false-positives was performed for all assays by (1) testing negative buffer (without swab)
interspersed with patient samples; (2) repeating RT-PCR from Ag-RDT buffer/swab sample for a subset of false-positive
Ag-RDT samples (where feasible from available quantity of buffer); (3) having the sampling performed by the same
person for Ag-RDT and PCR test (to limit variability in sampling); and (4) contacting participants again and retesting
with Ag-RDT and RT-PCR if they had persistent symptoms or COVID-19 cases in their surroundings. None of this workup yielded any evidence of cross-contamination, limited RT-PCR sensitivity or sampling error, which makes crossreactivity most likely as the reason for the false-positives (target of cross-reactivity unknown).

Discussion
Results of our multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study and analytical assessment show that the SD
Biosensor, Inc. STANDARD Q Ag-RDT COVID-19 Ag test can reach excellent sensitivity in high-viral load
infections, and good performance in the cohort overall 76∙6% (CI 62∙8-86∙4) with near-perfect
specificity (99∙3%; CI 98∙6-99∙6). These results hold promise for the performance of antigen-based
diagnosis and the control of the pandemic, particularly in low-resource settings.

SARS CoV-2 is a virus with a low dispersion factor, which indicates that a small number of infected
individuals are responsible for a large amount of the transmission - the so-called ‘super spreaders‘. 27
A super-spreader is likely to both have a high viral load, and the occasion to transmit to many people
due to aggregation of people in confined spaces. 28 With a sensitivity of 100% for the SD Biosensor in
infected persons with a high viral load, this Ag-RDT is likely to identify highly contagious individuals,
which would more substantially decrease transmission than what would be expected from its
imperfect overall sensitivity alone. Furthermore, the rapid turn-around time is likely to result in more
rapid isolation of cases and effective contact tracing. The ease-of-use and POC-suitability can enable
more frequent testing as compared to RT-PCR and thus, despite its limited sensitivity, the test is
expected to have impact on pandemic control based on a recent modelling study. 29

Considering the test in low prevalence settings (prevalence 1%), a negative test would have a negative
predictive value (NPV) of 99∙8%. And even at a prevalence of 10%, 97∙4% of negatively tested persons
would not be infected. Such an NPV would be considered acceptable outside of high-risk transmission
settings (e.g. in a hospital). The positive predictive value (PPV) would be 53% at 1% prevalence, ideally
requiring RT-PCR confirmation. At 10% prevalence, the PPV increases to 92%. This suggests that
several use-cases could be considered with substantial public health impact, but further
implementation research is needed to better detail how the tests can be used to the highest benefit.

Furthermore, stability only up to 30° Celsius and required storage conditions are a limitation for the
use in the Global South, and should be considered carefully in such settings.

Our study also shows wide variability in performance between Ag-RDTs with respect to performance
and ease-of-use, indicating the importance of manufacturer-independent validations. While our
findings largely corroborate the performance reported in the IFU of SD Biosensor, for Coris and
Bioeasy, they differed substantially in respect to specificity. For SD Biosensor, the lower overall
performance compared to the results in the IFU could relate to the fact that for some patients in our
study OP swabs were used. While this is not recommended by the manufacturer, the use of OP swabs
when NP is contraindicated, reflects a more clinically realistic scenario. NP/OP swabs were used based
on institutional recommendations in Berlin and Liverpool. While more proteases are expected in the
saliva that can degrade antigen, there should not be an impact on the sensitivity of Ag-RDTs in our
study, as swabs were processed immediately. Another aspect that could explain a lower senstivtiy is
the population tested in the study. The population tested was likely representative of the spectrum
of COVID-19, with less ill patients likely to have lower viral load at diagnosis and more likely Ag-RDT
negative. A higher clinical sensitivity would be expected when only hospitalized patients were
tested.30 For Bioeasy, our point estimate of specificity falls within the confidence interval of specificity
of the only other independently published study, which had few RT-PCR negative cases. 14

Overall, our study had several strengths. The study confirmed the accuracy of the tests by two
measures: analytical and clinical accuracy. The population enrolled for testing was representative of
the pandemic observed in Europe with a broad spectrum of age group (initially older age group and
with ongoing duration of the pandemic an increasingly younger age group presenting for testing) and
a spread of clinical presentations (from asymptomatic with high-risk contacts to severely ill). We
enrolled in two countries and although enrolment numbers in Liverpool were low, the results
confirmed findings in Germany. Due to the wide-spread testing available particularly in Germany, the

population tested is expected to be a representative spectrum of disease. The tests were performed
at POC at two sites (Berlin and Heidelberg) thus mimicking the real-world challenges of POC testing.
The comprehensive ease-of-use assessment with a standardized SUS-tool and a questionnaire,
developed specifically for the study, captured the differences between the tests and highlighted
important points for operationalization of the tests.

However, the study also has several limitations. First, the prevalence of positive cases decreased
substantially over the course of the study from 10% among tested individuals in early April as
documented by the local health department in Heidelberg, Germany, to 3% over the course of the
study. In addition, our study assessed a preselected population based on the regulations and criteria
from the local health department. Due to the nature of the pandemic, the selection criteria and
patient population changed throughout the study as visible from the percentage of patients with
symptoms and co-morbidities evaluated with the three Ag-RDTs, although differences between the
study populations were not significant. In addition, our study did use OP swabs for a subset of patients
as discussed above. Furthermore, the sub-analysis by CT-values has its limitations, as RT-PCR methods
varied across sites with different genome targets, PCR instruments and reagents. This might cause
misleading comparisons of CT-values between sites. 23 Therefore, we only performed an analysis of
dichotomized CT-values and considered <25 as high viral load and ≥25 as low viral load. In addition,
we translated CT-values into viral load, and determined the variability of the applied SARS-CoV-2
assays in testing of standardized dilutions of virus to be limited, as shown before. 21,22

Conclusion
Our results suggest that, though there is substantial variability between tests, at least one antigendetection POC test meets WHO targets and is now recommended by the WHO. 16 Given the fast turnaround-time and ease-of-use at POC, as well as the high sensitivity in patients with significant viral
load, the test is likely to have impact despite imperfect overall sensitivity; however, further

implementation research, economic evaluation and modelling are needed. With the agreement of
Roche and SD Biosensor, manufacturing scale-up and supply-chain solutions should guarantee
availability of the test. 31
