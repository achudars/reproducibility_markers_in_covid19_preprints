Abstract:

25

Management of the COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a significant challenge to policy

26

makers. This is in large part due to uneven reporting and the absence of open-access

27

visualization tools to present local trends and infer healthcare needs. Here we report the

28

development of CovidCounties.org, an interactive web application that depicts daily disease

29

trends at the level of US counties using time series plots and maps. This application is

30

accompanied by a manually curated dataset that catalogs all major public policy actions made

31

at the state-level, as well as technical validation of the primary data. Finally, the underlying

32

code for the site is also provided as open source, enabling others to validate and learn from this

33

work.

Introduction:

36
37

The disease known as COVID-19 was first reported in December of 2019 in Wuhan,

38

China1. Three months later it was declared a pandemic by the WHO, and since then its death

39

toll has reached over 150,000 while infecting over 2 million people across 210 countries

40

worldwide2. Additionally, the pandemic has disrupted the daily lives of billions and has incurred

41

significant socioeconomic costs at the global level.

42

In the US, the very assessment of the disease’s impact has been challenged by

43

limitations in accurate data capture and analysis. Variable testing, uneven reporting, barriers to

44

data sharing, and a lack of easy-to-use analytic tools have all contributed to a lack of clarity in

45

establishing and trending the state of the pandemic. As a consequence, policy makers at all

46

levels have been forced to make decisions of great socioeconomic consequence in the face of

47

significant uncertainty.

48

To improve the accessibility of basic COVID-19-related information in the US, especially

49

by the general public and policymakers without a data science background, we report the

50

creation of a new interactive visualization tool that depicts daily disease trends at the level of

51

individual US counties. This web application features the novel reuse of several publicly

52

available sources of data while also introducing a new, manually curated dataset accompanying

53

this manuscript. This site features several unique views, including local doubling times and

54

estimated ICU bed requirements by county. Additionally, we report the technical validation of

55

the primary data (counts per county per day) against other official- and commonly used sources

56

of data.

57
58

Methods:

59
60

Data sources: Data on state-wide and county-level counts were obtained from The New York

61

Times3 via their github repository (https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). County-wise

62

population data were obtained from the US Census4 using the R package tidycensus5. Data on

63

ICU bed availability per county was obtained from Kaiser Health News6.

64
65

As per The New York Times, cases and deaths reported from New York, Kings, Queens, Bronx

66

and Richmond counties were assigned to New York City. Similarly, Cass, Clay, Jackson and Platte

67

counties in Missouri were assigned to Kansas City. When a patient’s county of residence was

68

unknown or pending many state departments reported these cases as coming from “unknown”

69

counties. Cases reported from unknown counties were only included at the state level.

70
71

Data related to state-wide implementation of social-distancing policies were manually curated

72

by web search and independently reviewed by a second author; disagreements were rare and

73

resolved by discussion. Government websites were prioritized as sources of truth where

74

feasible; otherwise, news reports covering state-wide proclamations were used. All citations

75

are captured in the open data file accompanying this manuscript.

76

[https://datadryad.org/stash/share/whGecW9DWYmoAVMDdAHNF0z712Vbxrj9YwI5QKRAWUs

77

]. These data were up to date and confirmed as of the date of data deposit: April 19, 2020.

78
79

Ground truth data used for validation were manually curated from the websites of multiple

80

state departments of public health as well as Corona Data Scraper

81

[https://coronadatascraper.com/], a commonly used resource for aggregating county-level

82

tracking of COVID-19 over time. Citations of the validation data are included in the data file

Doubling Time: Doubling time was calculated for each state and county by taking the reciprocal

91

of difference between the log (base 2) case counts corresponding to adjacent days, then

92

applying the R function loess for smoothing. The input of this model required a minimum of 8

93

days of data where the minimum number of cases was greater than 10. Regularization was

94

performed by replacing extreme doubling times (>500 days) with the average of the

95

surrounding values.

96
97

ICU Bed Occupancy Model: We incorporated parameters related to rates of hospitalization and

98

ICU admission from work previously published by Ferguson et al.7. Although simpler than other

99

models, it fit publicly available county-level ICU bed data in California well and was easier to

100

understand for the user than more complicated models proposed 8–11. This model assumed a

101

4.4% rate of hospitalization among all new cases, a 30% rate of intensive care unit admission

102

among hospitalized patients, and a 9-day average length of stay (time until discharge or death).

103
104

Web Application Development and Deployment: See Figure 1 for an overall schematic of the

105

web application. The source code was written in R (4.1.0)12 using the shiny13, shinyjs14,

106

tidyverse15 and plotly16 packages. Software version control was achieved using Docker. The

107

entire software code for the site is publicly available on github

108

(https://github.com/vivical/ButteLabCOVID) and dockerhub

109

(https://hub.docker.com/r/pupster90/covid_tracker). The web hosting was organized as a

110

unified data share between all instances running R shiny code and controlled by a load balancer

111

using an auto-scaling mechanism. The web environment is hosted by Amazon Web Services and

112

is located at covidcounties.org.

113
114

Results:

115
116

CovidCounties derives a majority of its data from The New York Times Coronavirus github page

117

[https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data] which is updated daily with cases and deaths

118

reported in each state and county from the previous day. This time series dataset was derived

119

from a variety of governmental sources. However, to our knowledge this data has never been

120

formally validated against other reputed sources of COVID-19 reporting including state and

121

local departments of public health.

122
123

First, we demonstrate the high concordance of cumulative cases and deaths calculated and

124

displayed in CovidCounties at the county level by directly comparing these to numbers reported

125

by the Departments of Public Health in California and Connecticut (Figure 2A, 2B). These two

126

states were chosen because they both publicly report the daily counts of cases requiring

127

hospitalization or intensive care at the county level. R2 rates corresponding to the concordance

128

between predicted and actual counts ranged from 0.86 to 1. To our knowledge, California is

129

only state in the US to report county-wide ICU bed utilization rates. We found a high degree of

130

concordance (R2 = 0.87) with minimal model bias (Figure 2A), indicating a fairly high degree of

131

explained variation despite a relatively simplistic model.

132
133

An R2 of 1 was specifically found with respect to cumulative cases and deaths in Connecticut

134

(Figure 2B), suggesting a shared common data source.

135
136

We compared the concordance of our data with that reported by Corona Data Scraper

137

[https://coronadatascraper.com/], another widely used source of aggregated publicly-available

138

COVID-19 timeseries data at the county level. We found very high concordance (R2 = 0.95-0.97)

139

for deaths and cases respectively with no model bias (Figure 2C).

140
141

Lastly, we compared the concordance of our predicted hospitalizations, cases, and deaths from

142

our dataset against data reported by 8 different State Departments of Public Health (Figure 2D).

143

We noted some relative over-estimation of our estimated hospitalized counts against that

144

actual data reported by multiple State Departments of Public Health. Nonetheless concordance

145

was very high (R2 = 0.97-0.99).

146
147

Descriptive statistics on the New York Times data are provided in Table 1. 23 states reported

148

cases with unknown counties of residence, however, in all states except Rhode Island these

149

cases made up less than 4% of the total cases in that state (Table 1). The inability to map these

150

cases to specific counties may explain some of the discrepancies between the New York Times

data used in CovidCounties and the curated data from state public health departments and the

152

Corona Data Scraper.

153
154

The data and tools incorporated into CovidCounties support the effectiveness of social

155

distancing measures, consistent with several events that have occurred following the initial

156

release of the website. South Dakota, one of six states which does not have a statewide shelter

157

in place order (as of April 15, 2020), has experienced rapid case growth following an exposure

158

at a meat plant (Figure 3A). This has accounted for more than half of the state's cases17 as of

159

April 15, 2020, with the fastest statewide doubling time of 4.5 days (Figure 3B). By contrast,

160

states with early shelter in place times like Arizona on March 11, 2020, California on March 19,

161

2020, and Connecticut on March 20, 2020 (Figure 3A) have much slower doubling times of 19.3

162

days, 22.8 days, and 12.7 days respectively (Figure 3B).

163
164

The web application located at covidcounties.org was first released to the public on April 3,

165

2020. It features two sections: a line plot depicting time-series trends in disease dynamics, and

166

a map depicting geospatial relationships (Figure 4). The site has had over 15 thousand unique

167

site in the first week as of April 11, 2020, most of whom accessed the website using a mobile

168

device.

169
170

Discussion:

171
172

The effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hindered by both inaccurate

173

data collection and reporting, as well as relative inaccessibility by non-data scientists. Taken

174

together, these difficulties have impeded optimal policymaking by both government (imposing

175

social distancing policies) and health systems (anticipating ICU utilization) alike. Consequently,

176

responses across institutions have been highly variable and with varying degrees of success. To

177

help address these gaps we developed covidcounties.org and performed the technical

178

validation reported in this work.

180

The curation of COVID-19 case and death counts by The New York Times is an impressive effort

181

by over 60 reporters to collect, curate and analyze a constantly growing and evolving dataset3.

182

However, they acknowledge that the underlying data is extremely fragmented and comes from

183

thousands of different sources at both the state and county levels and thus is inherently limited

184

by accuracy, consistency, and timeliness. The New York Times notes that reported cases have

185

been corrected mere hours after the initial report and there have been numerous instances

186

where data has disappeared from databases without explanation. The New York Times has also

187

chosen to count patients where they were treated rather than their place of residence and

188

report on a number of geographic exceptions in their dataset

189

(https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) including the treatment of cities like New York City

190

and Kansas City and the allocation of cases from cruise ships. Further, there are a subset of

191

cases where the patient’s county of residence cannot or has not yet been identified which is

192

generally a small fraction of a state’s total cases but can be a significant number in a small state

193

like Rhode Island (Table 1).

194
195

Taken together, these subtleties of the data collection process imply that the COVID-19 data

196

from The New York Times may not exactly agree with the numbers reported by various state

197

and county Departments of Public Health. We quantified the consistencies between The New

198

York Times COVID-19 data and county (Figure 2A, 2B) and state (Figure 2D) Department of

199

Public Health data and found the datasets to be largely comparable. Based on the exact

200

agreement, it seems likely that The New York Times is deriving their data for Connecticut

201

directly from the Connecticut Department of Public Health (Figure 2B).

202
203

The comparison of our estimated hospitalized cases based on the simple model from Ferguson

204

et al.7 with state (Figure 2C) and county (Figure 2B) reported hospitalizations revealed a

205

systematic bias towards increased hospitalizations in our model. We suspect that this bias is

206

due to a number of factors including time lags between the date of hospitalization and the

207

results of testing, as well as miscalibration of the assumed 4.4% rate of hospitalization taken

208

from the Ferguson model7,8,11.

209
210

With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic we have observed a trend towards government

211

agencies at the municipal, county, state, and national levels making their data increasingly

212

accessible for re-use and therefore provide potential value. However, many of the most popular

213

tools which are built upon this freely available data do not provide their source code for further

214

development. The Johns Hopkins dashboard2, which receives more than 1.2 billion hits per day,

215

has made their data publicly available18, however, the source code for their dashboard is not

216

made available for further development by third parties. Similarly, the IHME dashboard19 which

217

has been referenced by the White House for making policy decisions20 has had their dashboard

218

peer reviewed21, however, their epidemiological model has yet to be peer reviewed9. While

219

IHME provides open source code on their data aggregation process

220

(https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019) and some features of their model

221

including the curve fitting of their projections (https://github.com/ihmeuw-msca/CurveFit), the

222

whole dashboard is not open source. Additionally, many states and counties are using Tableau,

223

a proprietary piece of software, to visualize COVID-1922 and as of 4/17/2020 there are 1,184

224

coronavirus dashboards on Tableau public23. While Tableau facilitates powerful data

225

visualization, the software is not open source and requires a license for use. To promote further

226

development of CovidCounties and fully leverage the available data we have implemented our

227

website using the commonly used R and Rshiny frameworks, and made all of our source code

228

freely available on github (https://github.com/vivical/ButteLabCOVID).

229
230

CovidCounties represents an improvement over existing dashboards in terms of both scope and

231

granularity. Existing COVID-19 dashboards generally focus either on county level data within a

232

particular state (primarily at a static timepoint) or at the state level across the United States.

233

We have developed an intuitive tool that facilitates temporal comparisons between all counties

234

in the US. However, we are inherently limited by the availability of data. While CovidCounties’

235

estimation of ICU needs at the county level allows for higher resolution allocation of resources

236

compared to the widely used state level model from IHME

237

(https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america), zip code level data would further

238

improve the value of these estimations for resource allocation. States like Maryland24,

239

Arizona25, and South Carolina26 and counties like Johnson County, Kansas27, San Diego County,

240

California28, and King County, Washington29 have already made zip code level data available.

241

However, there are many states and counties that are hesitant to provide data of this

242

granularity due to concerns over privacy thus highlighting the challenge of balancing privacy

243

with public good.

244
245

A limitation of CovidCounties is the inherent dependence on publicly available data. To date,

246

most states and counties are primarily providing case and death data with an increasing

247

number also providing hospitalization data. However, there is a severe lack of testing

248

information. The lack of testing data limits the ability to make inferences on the infection rate

249

in the population and the improvement of model trajectories. It has also been proposed that

250

there has been an under ascertainment of cases especially in the asymptomatic30, which can

251

influence case rates. States and counties are continuously ramping up testing and this sudden

252

availability of tests can artificially distort counts by attributing individuals who were infected

253

previously to a later date due to an earlier shortage of tests. These numbers are further

254

complicated by the wide variety of commercially available tests that rely on different

255

technologies with varying sensitivity and specificity.

256
257

With its release, covidcounties.org represents a powerful open-source platform to empower

258

non-data scientists to track the current trends of the COVID-19 pandemic at the county level to

259

help facilitate policy and healthcare decisions which can help improve outcomes. We welcome

volunteers (both technical and non-technical) to help us to further develop CovidCounties

Methods. Data was processed to reflect case and death counts at the level of states and

309

counties. Functions were written to perform x- and y-axis rescaling, normalization by

310

population, doubling time estimation, and ICU bed utilization. Results were depicted using

311

interactive line plots and maps.

A. Comparison of estimated ICU bed occupancy, cumulative cases, and cumulative deaths

315

reported by CovidCounties against corresponding data reported by the California Department

316

of Public Health. Each point corresponds to a measurement from a given California county on a

317

particular date where both datasets report counts. Data is from 4/1/2020 - 4/9/2020.

318

B. Comparison of the estimated hospital bed occupancy, cumulative cases, and cumulative

319

deaths reported by CovidCounties against corresponding data reported by the Connecticut

320

Department of Public Health. Each point corresponds to a measurement from a given

321

Connecticut county on a particular date where both datasets report counts. Data is from

322

3/24/2020 - 4/9/2020.

Figure 3: Effect of shelter in place orders on doubling time

334

A. States within the United States are color-coded by percentile of date to implement state

335

mandated shelter in place. White indicates earlier dates (among states) while dark orange

336

indicates later dates or no state mandate.

337

B. States within the United States are color-coded by percentile of case doubling time on April

338

15, 2020. Dark orange indicates a fast doubling time (among states), white indicates a slow

339

doubling time.

Figure 4: Overview of CovidCounties.org.

342

A. The primary view of CovidCounties.org is the line plot view, depicting time-series trends by

343

individual county. Depicted counties may be selected by single or double clicking the counties

344

displayed in the legend. They may also be selected by typing in counties (including from outside

345

of a given state) at the bottom.

346

B. User-selected individual states are color coded according to the variable of interest (e.g.

347

cumulative cases). Dark orange corresponds to the highest percentiles within the state, white

348

indicates the lowest percentile. Hovering functionality displays statistics corresponding to a

349

given county.

350

C. Line plot views can be extensively customized, with features to enable axis re-

351

centering/scaling, count normalization, depiction of doubling time, and predicted ICU bed

352

utilization. Individual state and United States plots update to reflect selected parameters where

353

appropriate.

354

D. States within the United States are color-coded by percentile according to the variable of

355

interest (e.g. cumulative cases). Dark orange indicates relatively high percentile (among states),

356

white indicates low percentile. Hovering functionality displays statistics corresponding to a

Data reported as of 4/16/2020. States with highest % of unknown cases shows the percent of

365

cases from unknown counties as a fraction of total cases in the state, the absolute number of

366

cases from unknown counties in the state, and the cases per million from unknown counties in

367

the state. States with lowest % of counties reporting shows the percentage of counties

368

reporting, the number of counties reporting, and total counties in the state. Counties with

369

highest estimated ICU needs shows the ICU needs as a percentage based on the estimated

370

number of ICU beds needed and KHN reported number of ICU beds.
