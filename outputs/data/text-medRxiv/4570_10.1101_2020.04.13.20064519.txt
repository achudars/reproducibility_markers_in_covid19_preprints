Abstract
We apply a model developed by The COVID-19 Response Team [S. Flaxman, S.
Mishra, A. Gandy, et al., “Estimating the number of infections and the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 11 European countries,” tech. rep.,
Imperial College London, 2020.] to estimate the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections
in the United States. Across the United States we estimate as of April 18, 2020 the
fraction of the population infected was 4.6% [3.6%, 5.8%], 21 times the portion of the
population with a positive test result. Excluding New York state, which we estimate
accounts for over half of infections in the United States, we estimate an infection rate of
2.3% [2.1%, 2.8%].
We include the timing of each state’s implementation of interventions including
encouraging social distancing, closing schools, banning public events, and a lockdown /
stay-at-home order. We assume fatalities are reported correctly and infer the number
and timing of infections based on the infection fatality rate measured in populations that
were tested universally for SARS-CoV-2. Underreporting of deaths would drive our
estimates to be too low. Reporting of deaths on the wrong day could drive errors in
either direction. This model does not include effects of herd immunity; in states where
the estimated infection rate is very high - namely, New York - our estimates may be too
high.

I. Introduction
The first case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, diagnosed in the United
States was discovered on January 21, 2020 [1]. Since then, limited availability of
SARS-CoV-2 tests has interfered with efforts to track the spread of the virus. As of April
18, 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University there were 732,200 reported cases in
the United States [2]. The true number of cases could be far higher.

Europe has faced similar constraints on SARS-CoV-2 testing. The COVID-19 Response
Team (CRT) at Imperial College London has responded to this challenge, in part, by
developing a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the true number of infections and
the impact of policies intended to slow the epidemic [3]. In this paper, we apply the CRT
model to individual states in the United States, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.
We remove states with fewer than 10 reported fatalities. We also reproduce the CRT
estimates for 11 European countries with data through April 18, 2020.
We briefly summarize the CRT model here, but refer to [3] for full details. The model
takes three inputs from each modeled population: 1) the age distribution, 2) the time
series of known COVID-19 fatalities, and 3) the start dates of four mitigation policies
(encouraging social distancing, closing schools and universities, banning public events,
and a lockdown / stay-at-home order). It also relies on four values estimated from prior
research: 1) the infection fatality ratio (IFR) by age, 2) the serial interval distribution, 3)
the infection-to-onset distribution, and 4) the onset-to-death distribution. These values
are measured from several cases in which all members of a small population at high
risk of infection were tested and observed, whether or not they showed symptoms. They
are not extracted from population data based on testing people who are already
symptomatic. We discuss the IFR further in section III.
There are several possible sources of error we do not account for. First, we assume
COVID-19 fatalities are reported correctly. If they are underreported, the infection
estimates here will be underestimates. If they are reported on the wrong day, the
estimates could be distorted in either direction. Second, the model extrapolates
exponential growth rates without reference to the size of the population. If the estimated
attack rate approaches the level of herd immunity, the model likely overestimates the
total number of infections. Third, we assume the IFR is known exactly. Propagating the
error from the IFR would increase the width of our confidence intervals.
The model estimates the baseline reproduction number of the virus without intervention,
R_0, and the impact of the considered interventions. It fits one value for each of these
variables across all populations simultaneously. The impact of any given intervention is
the same for all populations. Most of the interventions were implemented in Europe
before the United States. Therefore, the model estimates the impact of these
interventions mostly based on the trajectory of the epidemic in Europe. Using the
number of fatalities as of a given time, we can infer the number of infections in the past,
and extrapolate them to the present using the fitted reproduction numbers under
different policy regimes. The model does not use the reported number of infections.

This approach differs from the CRT’s model in [4], which is a detailed SIR model.
Instead, this model more closely matches that of the UW IHME [5], which forecasts
exponential growth rates after different policies are implemented based on historical
growth rates in countries and states that previously implemented similar policies.

II. Results
As in Europe, we estimate infections in the United States are much higher than reported
infections. As of April 18, 2020 we estimate the attack rate in the United States was
4.6% [3.6%, 5.8%], 21 times the reported infections of 732,200. The difference between
estimated and reported infections varies substantially by state. In New York, there are
an estimated 7,600,000 infections, 32 times the reported value of 237,000. Whereas, in
Utah, our estimate of infections is only 3.0 times the reported value.
In Figure 1 and Table 1 we report the estimated fraction of the population infected in
each state. The highest estimate is in New York, at 39.8% [22.8%, 56.9%], followed by
New Jersey at 19.7% [12.0%, 33.4%].

Table 2. Fraction of the population infected for each of 11 European countries and the
United States as of April 18, 2020, estimated from our model. *The fraction of the
population infected for the United States is the population-weighted average of the
states we are able to model. Those states sum to 98% of the US population.
In each population, the model infers the time series of infections that most likely gave
rise to the observed time series of fatalities. In the appendix, in Figure A1 through
Figure A56, we show the estimated and reported time series of infections and fatalities.
Model parameters are fit jointly across all populations. The first panel in each of these
figures shows how well the model reproduces the observed fatalities. The gap between
estimated and reported fatalities can be interpreted, in part, as a measure of how well
the model reproduces the epidemic in each population.

III. Methods
We retrieved dates for policy interventions as follows. We took lockdown dates from the
New York Times rounded to the nearest day (lockdowns going into effect past noon are
recorded as the next day) [6]. School closure dates are from [7]. Following [3], if a
school closure began on a Monday, we set the date of the school closure to the
previous Saturday. We set social distancing and the ban of public events to Mar 16,
2020 for all states, when federal guidelines were put into place [8]. See the dates we
assign for each region in each state in the Appendix (Table A1). Age distributions for
each state come from the US Census Bureau [9]. The time series of reported fatalities
and cases in the United States comes from the Johns Hopkins dashboard [2]. The time
series of reported fatalities and cases in the 11 European countries comes from the
European Centre of Disease Control (ECDC) [10]. We change the name of the country
“Georgia” to “Georgia(country)” in the ECDC data set to avoid confusion with the state
of Georgia. In the ECDC data we also delete the entries for Puerto Rico, for which we
get duplicate data as a US territory. For the 11 European countries, IFR comes from [3].
All other IFR’s are age-adjusted from [11].
