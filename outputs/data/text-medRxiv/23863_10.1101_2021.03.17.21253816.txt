ABSTRACT

34

Introduction: Early identification of COVID-19 patients at risk of critical illness is challenging

35

for clinicians. Immunological, virological, and routine laboratory markers to be used in

36

addition to clinical data are needed.

37

Aim and methods: Blood tests to measure neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), levels of

38

ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, complement components (C3, C4), lymphocyte subsets, and

39

cytokines, and SARS-Cov2 RT-PCR tests were performed in COVID-19 confirmed cases

40

within 48 hours of admission. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined by RT-PCR from

41

oral or nasopharyngeal swabs on the day of admission. Severity of symptoms was

42

categorized as mild (grade 1), severe (grade 2), and critical (grade 3).

43

Results: 120 patients were included. COVID-19 was mild in 49, severe in 32, and

44

critical in 39. Ferritin >370 ng/mL (OR 16.4, 95% CI 5.3-50.8), D-dimer >440 ng/mL (OR 5.45,

45

95% CI 2.36-12.61), CRP >7.65 mg/dL (OR 11.54, 95% CI 4.3-30.8), NLR >3.77 (OR 13.4,

46

95% CI 4.3-41.1), IL-6 >142.5 pg/mL (OR 8.76, 95% CI 3.56-21.54), IL-10 >10.8 pg/mL (OR

47

16.45, 95% CI 5.32-50.81), sIL-2rα (sCD25) >804.5 pg/mL (OR 14.06, 95% CI 4.56-43.28),

48

IL-1Ra >88.4 pg/mL (OR 4.54, 95% CI 2.03-10.17), and IL-18 >144 pg/mL (OR 17.85, 95%

49

CI 6.54-48.78) were associated with critical COVID-19 in the univariate age-adjusted

50

analysis. In the multivariate age-adjusted analysis, this association was confirmed only for

51

ferritin, CRP,NLR, IL-10, sIL-2rα, and IL-18. T, B, and NK cells were significantly decreased

52

in critical patients. SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in blood except in 3 patients with

53

indeterminate results. Ct values determined by RT-PCR from oral/nasopharyngeal swabs on

54

admission were not related to symptom severity.

Conclusion: levels of ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, NLR, and cytokines and cytokine receptors IL-

56

6, IL1-Ra, sCD25, IL-18, and IL-10, taken together with clinical data, can contribute to the

57

early identification of critical COVID-19 patients.

Background

62

The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel

63

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in China in December 2019 and rapidly escalated

64

to a global pandemic with millions of confirmed cases worldwide, with numbers still rising [1-

65

3]. Most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or result in only mild disease. However, in a

66

substantial percentage of patients, respiratory illness requiring hospital care develops.

67

Pulmonary disease can progress to critical illness with extensive lung damage and

68

hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support [1]. Strategies for

69

predicting the risk of disease progression are needed. Different clinical and laboratory

70

markers to be used in the emergency setting are under investigation [4, 5], and several score

71

models have been developed [6]. Identifying patients at high risk of critical illness on

72

admission is challenging for clinicians, but is crucial for screening patients in need of more

73

intensive treatment to improve prognosis. Several COVID-19 studies have shown an

74

association between increased levels of serum inflammatory markers and proinflammatory

75

cytokines and severe disease [7, 8]. A number of cytokines and chemokines have been

76

implicated in the induction of the so-called cytokine storm [9-11] and some, notably interleukin

77

(IL) 6, are now considered as both prognostic factors and therapeutic targets [12, 13]. Some

78

investigators have also suggested a prognostic value of semi-quantitative real-time reverse

transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs, which

80

determines viral load through cycle threshold (Ct) values, with lower Ct values associated

81

with worse outcomes [14]. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viremia has been reported in severe

82

cases [15].

83

The purpose of our study was to identify routine laboratory, immunological and

84

virological biomarkers to be used together with clinical data for early identification of patients

85

at risk of developing critical illness.

86

Methods

87

Participants and study design

88

Patients admitted to Son Espases and Son Llàtzer hospitals in Palma de Mallorca

89

between 17 April and 20 July 2020 with positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR test who

90

accepted to participate in the study were included. Blood samples to measure the

91

neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, complement

92

components (C3, C4), lymphocyte subsets, and serum levels of cytokines, and to perform

93

SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR testing were obtained within the first 48 hours of admission.

94

The severity of signs and symptoms developed during hospitalization was categorized as

95

mild (grade 1), severe (grade 2), and critical (grade 3). Mild disease was established when

96

the patient had symptoms without pneumonia or had mild pneumonia; severe disease was

97

established when dyspnea was associated with a respiratory rate ≥30/min or blood oxygen

98

saturation <93%, or a partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio

99

<300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours from admission; critical disease

100

was established for cases with respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ

101

dysfunction or failure [1]. The most severe category developed during hospitalization was

102

selected, and it occurred in the first 72h of admission in all cases.

Procedures

105

Routine blood examinations included leukocyte, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts

106

(cells*10^3/µL) and percentages. Serum biochemical tests recorded were ferritin (ng/L)

107

determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay in architect i2000 equipment , CRP

108

(mg/dL), and D-dimer (µg/L) quantified by immunoturbidimetry in architect 16.000,

109

Immunological tests recorded were serum complement levels (C3, C4), lymphocyte subset

110

cell counts (cells*10^3/µL) and percentages using flow cytometry, and plasma cytokine

111

levels.

112

ImmunoAssays,SA, Belgium) to measure serum levels of IL-6, a chemiluminiscence assay

113

(IMMULITE, Siemens, Germany) to determinate serum soluble IL-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2rα

114

or sCD25), and a human cytokine magnetic bead panel (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)

115

to measure levels of other cytokines associated with cytokine storm: IL-1β, IL-1 receptor

116

antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-22, interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor

117

alpha (TNF-α), and IL-10.

118

SARS-CoV-2 was determined in nasopharyngeal swab specimens (within 16 hours of their

119

collection) and in plasma samples stored at -70ºC until testing. Nucleic acids were extracted

120

using a Hamilton automated extraction platform and the amplification process was performed

121

in a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR detection instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using two

122

commercial RT-PCR kits: Allplex 2019-nCoV (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), which detects the

123

presence of 3 target genes E gene, RdRP gene, and N gene; and LightMix® Modular SARS-

124

CoV (COVID-19) E-gene (TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany).

125

In order to assess the correlation between semi-quantitative viral load values and pattern of

126

disease severity, Ct values were recorded for each gene.

Statistical analysis

129

Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages, and continuous

130

variables as mean and standard deviation (SD), or median and interquartile range (IQR)

131

values. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. The

132

independent group t test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for the comparison of

133

continuous normally and not normally distributed variables, respectively. Normal distribution

134

was studied by plotting histograms and with the Shapiro-Wilk test. A Kruskall Wallis test was

135

performed to compare the difference between the three groups of patients classified

136

according to disease severity. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used

137

to assess the diagnostic value of the biological markers, and the optimal cut-off value

138

providing the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity was selected with the Youden

139

index. Univariate and multivariate age-adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed

140

to explore the association between laboratory parameters and the risk of developing critical

141

disease, using the values provided by the Youden index as cut-off points.

142

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social

143

Sciences) version 22.0 software (SPSS Inc.). Two-sided P values of less than .05 were

144

considered statistically significant.

Results

147

Between 17 April and 20 July 2020, 120 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients

148

accepted to participate and were included in the study. There were 55 women and 65 men,

149

and median age was 59 years (29-89). COVID-19 was considered mild in 49 patients, severe

150

in 32 and critical in 39 cases. Twenty patients (16.67%) died during hospitalization. The death

151

of 2 of them was not related to COVID-19 but to an associated malignancy. Pulmonary

152

embolism (PE) was diagnosed in 15 patients (12.5%), and of these, 9 had critical COVID-19.

153

Demographic characteristics and comorbidities of SARs-COV-2 infected patients with mild,

154

severe, and critical disease are presented in Table 1. Compared with patients with mild or

155

severe disease, critically ill patients were significantly more likely to be men (p = .00), have

156

older age (p = .036), concomitant hypertension (p = .036), and diabetes mellitus (p = .023).

157

-Laboratory data:

158

Laboratory markers were tested on admission (Table 2), and their cut-off values were

159

calculated to predict the risk of developing critical COVID-19 (Fig 1). In the univariate

160

analysis, ferritin > 370 ng/mL (OR [odds ratio] 16.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-50.8),

161

D-dimer >440 ng/mL (OR 5.45, 95% CI 2.36-12.61), CRP > 7.65 mg/dL (OR 11.54, 95% CI

162

4.3-30.8), and NLR > 3.77 (OR 13.4, 95% CI 4.3-41.1) predicted the development of critical

163

COVID-19. In the multivariate analysis, the risk was statistically significant for ferritin (OR 8.1,

164

95% CI 2.1-30.6), NLR (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.6-24.0), and CRP (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.4-17.4), but

165

not for D-dimer.

166

-Immunological results:

167

Serum complement levels were measured on admission. Median values of C3 and C4

168

levels in critical COVID-19 patients (group 3) were 116 mg/dL (108.0–127.7) and 26.0 mg/dL

169

(17.0-39.0), respectively, whereas in mild and severe patients (groups 1 and 2) the median

170

values were 125 mg/dL (105.5–145.5) and 26.5 mg/dL (21.0-33.0), respectively (P > .05).

171

Low C4 levels (<20 mg/dL) were found in 5/15 (33.3%) patients with PE versus 22/105

172

(20.9%) patients without PE (p > .05) and in 10/39 (25.6%) patients with critical disease

173

versus 9/49 (18.4%) patients with mild disease (p > .05)

174

Levels of IL-6, sIL-2rα (sCD25), IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-8, IL-17A, IL-18, IL-22, IFN, IL-10,

175

and TNF-α were analyzed (Table 3). IL-6, IL-10, sIL-2rα, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 levels were

176

significantly elevated on admission in patients who developed a critical disease. A cut-off

177

value for each of these markers was determined to predict the risk of developing a critical

178

COVID-19 (Figure 1). Values of IL-6 > 142.5 pg/mL, IL-10 > 10.8 pg/mL, IL1β > 4.68pg/ml ,

179

sIL-2rα > 804.5 pg/mL, IL-1Ra > 88.4 pg/mL, and IL-18 > 144 pg/mL were associated with

180

the development of critical COVID-19 in the age-adjusted univariate analysis. In the age-

181

adjusted multivariate analysis, this association was confirmed only for IL-10, sIL-2rα, and IL-

182

18 (Table 4).

183

Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in peripheral blood in a subgroup of patients on

184

admission. The total number of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells was significantly decreased

185

in patients with more severe disease (Table 5). Neither a univariate nor a multivariate analysis

186

was performed due to the small number of patients with critical COVID-19.

187

-Microbiological study:

188

Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab samples obtained from 89 patients on the day

189

of admission were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR either targeting E, N, and RdRP genes

190

(72 patients) or E gene alone (17 patients). No significant differences in median Ct values

191

according to symptom severity were observed (Table 6). No statistically significant

192

differences between Ct values and number of days from symptom onset on admission or

193

mortality were found either. Ct values >34 (associated with a low viral load) for the E gene

194

on hospital admission were found in 16/89 (17.9%) patients; 2 had critical COVID-19 and 5

195

had severe COVID-19. Additionally, the N and RdPR genes were studied in 8/16 patients

196

and a Ct value >34 was found in 3 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed in blood

samples from 73 patients. All the results were interpreted as negative except in 3 cases that

198

gave an indeterminate result (only a Ct >38 for the N gene was detected).

199

Discussion

200

Our study has identified a number of biomarkers which, in combination with the clinical

201

classification, may be used to better evaluate the severity of COVID-19 and optimize

202

therapeutic management strategies. Moreover, we propose cut-off values for each of these

203

markers to predict the risk of developing critical COVID-19. sCD25, IL-1Ra, and IL-18 are of

204

special interest as they have rarely been described as prognostic factors in COVID-19.

205

CRP, D-dimer, and ferritin have been described early in the pandemic as markers of

206

hyperinflammatory state and disease severity [7, 16, 17], and COVID-19 guidelines have

207

suggested that measuring their levels may have prognostic value [18]. Ferritin may be

208

produced by activated pulmonary macrophages, and COVID-19 systemic inflammation is

209

now considered as part of the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndromes because a significant

210

increase in ferritin levels has been found in severe compared with non-severe COVID-19

211

patients [19-22]. Similarly, CRP and D-dimer have been identified as prognostic markers, and

212

cut-off values have been suggested in several studies: CRP > 4.96 mg/dL and D-dimer >

213

2600 ng/mL have been associated with critical illness in a study in China [7], whereas D-

214

dimer > 500 ng/mL or >1000 ng/mL was found to be a significant risk factor for death in other

215

studies [17, 23, 24]. However, in our study, the cut-off value of 440 ng/mL proposed for D-

216

dimer was associated with a higher risk of developing critical disease in the univariate

217

analysis but not in the multivariate analysis and neither was it associated with PE since D-

218

dimer concentrations >440 ng/mL were observed on admission in only 9/15 patients who

219

were later diagnosed with PE during hospitalization. NLR has already proven its prognostic

220

value in cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, in several types of cancer, and in some

221

bacterial diseases [25]. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, lymphopenia and

222

increased NLR have been widely described as markers of severity [9, 16, 17]. Different

223

mechanisms have been proposed for COVID-19-related lymphopenia: T cell exhaustion,

224

apoptosis, pyroptosis, and a direct cytopathic effect of the virus [26]. Flow cytometric

225

evaluation was useful in our study to investigate this lymphopenia. We found a significant

226

reduction of all lymphocyte subsets —CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells (with no inversion in

227

the CD4+/CD8+ ratio), NK cells, and B lymphocytes— in severe/critical patients compared

228

to mild patients, in line with findings from other studies [16, 27, 28]. In addition, CD3+CD8+ T

229

cell counts ≤75 cells/μL have been associated with death [23].

230

Immunological markers were investigated. Since hypocomplementemia has been

231

reported in several viral infections and activation of the complement system and vascular

232

deposition of complement components have been found in SARS-CoV thrombotic

233

microangiopathy, the complement system was assessed. Neither our study nor a previous

234

report found lower C3 or C4 levels in severe COVID-19 patients [29], but a relationship

235

between PE and low C4 levels cannot be excluded. However, a recent study addressed the

236

activation of the complement system measuring C3a, C3c, and the terminal complement

237

complex and found significant higher levels in ICU COVID-19 patients compared to non-ICU

238

COVID-19 patients [30].

239
240

Eleven cytokines or their receptors were tested on admission in the 120 patients, and
IL-6, IL-10, IL1, IL-1Ra, sIL-2rα (sCD25), and IL-18 were found to be of prognostic value.

241

High serum levels of IL-6 have been widely described as a hallmark of severity in

242

COVID-19 [9, 11, 16, 31, 32]. IL-6 plays a central role in the cytokine storm as it induces

243

cytotoxic T lymphocytes, promotes Th17 cell lineage, inhibits regulatory T cells, and activates

244

B cells and antibody production. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis [33]

245

concluded that threefold higher serum IL-6 levels were found in patients with severe COVID-

246

19 compared with those with noncomplicated disease, and that such increased levels were

247

significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including ICU admission, acute

248

respiratory distress syndrome, and death. Furthermore, several studies have suggested a

249

benefit of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor antagonists for the management of critical COVID-19

250

patients [12, 21, 34].

251

We found that both IL-1Ra and IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokines were significantly

252

elevated in critical cases compared with moderate or severe ones. IL-10 has been described

253

early in the pandemic as a marker of severe disease [9, 31]. IL-1Ra produced by activated

254

macrophages is a competitive antagonist for IL-1 and controls inflammatory responses,

255

modulating the production of other inflammatory cytokines. IL-1Ra has been previously

256

investigated in several small studies and increased levels have been found in severe clinical

257

cases [35, 36], supporting its role as an important marker of disease severity.

258

IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine that facilitates IFN-γ production by Th1 cells in

259

conjunction with IL-12 and activation of CD8+ T cells. In our study, significantly higher IL-18

260

levels were found in critical patients compared with moderate or mildly ill patients. A

261

correlation between IL-18 and the severity of COVID-19 had only been found in a small study

262

[8], but a recent study has suggested this cytokine has a prognostic value [37].

263

The serum sIL-2rα (sCD25) level is considered an important disease marker in

264

hemophagocytic syndromes/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis [38]. However, its value as

265

a prognostic factor in COVID-19 has been rarely reported. A small preliminary study in China

266

with 21 patients found significant increased serum sCD25 levels in critical patients compared

267

with patients with moderate disease [16], and the authors have suggested that sCD25 may

268

act as a negative regulatory factor for T cells, contributing to lymphopenia. Other investigators

269

have suggested the relevance of the sIL-2rα /lymphocyte index for early identification of

270

severe COVID-19 and prediction of the clinical progression of the disease [39]. In our study,

271

sCD25 was accurate in estimating the risk of complicated disease, as a cut-off value of >

272

804.5 pg/mL yielded a 73.3% sensitivity and 76.0% specificity for developing critical COVID-

273

19.

274

Finally, virological markers were studied as prognostic factors for the development of

275

severe disease, but our results failed to confirm any association. We did not find a correlation

276

between Ct values determined by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens and

277

severity of the disease. Previous studies have reported conflicting results: a correlation

278

between lower Ct values (representing higher viral loads) in respiratory samples and greater

279

disease severity has been shown in certain studies [40-43], but other studies of non-SARS-

280

CoV-2 respiratory viruses have not shown such correlation [14, 40-42, 44]. SARS-CoV-2

281

testing of blood samples from critical COVID-19 patients who died was negative in 70 patients

282

and indeterminate in 3. The detection of SARS-CoV in plasma was associated with critical

283

disease in the 2003 SARS pandemic [45], but COVID-19 studies have been scarce. One

284

study detected SARS-CoV-2 viremia in up to 41% of patients admitted in a hospital in

285

Zhejiang province, China [46].

286

Our study has some important limitations: it took place in a very specific geographic

287

area (two hospitals in the Mediterranean island of Majorca), and the number of patients is

288

small. In addition, patients were admitted at different times during the course of the COVID-

289

19 pandemic and received different therapies, which may have altered the outcomes.

290
291

In conclusion, ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, NLR, and cytokines and cytokine receptors IL-6,

292

IL-1Ra, sIL-2rα (sCD25), IL-18, and IL-10 contribute, in association with clinical data, to the

293

early identification of patients at risk of critical COVID-19 and susceptible of a more intensive
