Abstract. To date, COVID-19 case rates are disproportionately higher in Black and Latinx
communities across the U.S., leading to more hospitalizations and deaths in those communities.
These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with
differing race/ethnicities of their residents. Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more
adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health
experiencing higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to greater morbidity and
mortality resulting from equivalent SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence. We surveyed five pairs of
adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID-19 case rates for highly specific and
quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS-CoV-2 to compare with their
disparate COVID-19 case rates. Dried blood spot samples were self-collected at home by
internet-recruited participants in summer 2020, shortly after Chicago’s first wave of the COVID19 pandemic. Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID-19 case rates had
similar seropositivity rates for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies.
Overall, these findings of comparable exposure to SARS-CoV-2 across neighborhoods with very
disparate COVID-19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health, and the comorbidities related to them, driving differences in COVID-19 rates across neighborhoods.

The US has led the world in numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections (1) with Chicago
as one of the epicenters with 241,655 cases of COVID-19 resulting in 4,909 deaths by
February 20, 2021 (2). From early in the pandemic, stark racial/ethnic disparities were
evident in COVID-19 deaths. Subsequent analyses of public health surveillance data
further explicated the nature of COVID-19 racial disparities, with many studies showing
that communities with more Black or Latinx residents had higher case and mortality
rates (3). Studies examining the drivers of these racial/ethnic disparities have found
relatively consistent associations with residential segregation of economic
disadvantage, proportion of essential workers, and crowded living conditions (4-6).
There have been inconsistent results across studies regarding whether comorbidities
mediate the observed racial/ethnic disparities (3, 7, 8).
The analyses demonstrating such disparities mostly relied on molecular testing to
diagnose acute, symptomatic COVID-19 illness by detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal
and nasopharyngeal swabs (9). However, from the beginning of the pandemic until the
present, acute viral diagnostic testing has not always been readily accessible to all. This
could limit accurate estimation of the COVID-19 case rate and epidemiological patterns
of SARS-CoV-2 spread by not identifying minimally symptomatic and asymptomatic, but
potentially infectious, cases (10-13). Many infections are asymptomatic or minimally
symptomatic, although still capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to others (10). A
complementary epidemiological approach is serological testing to detect antibodies
against the virus (14, 15). Virus protein-specific antibodies emerge within weeks after
infection, and subsequent IgG specific antibodies remain detectable for 4 or more
months after infection, depending on assay sensitivity and specificity. This is much

longer than the several weeks that airway virus RNA remains detectable (16-19) after
recovery from symptoms (20). Thus, serology has portential to identify infections long
after their initiation, independent of clinical diagnosis and symptom experience,
potentially providing a fuller epidemiologic assessment of the pandemic. Assessment of
all SARS-CoV-2 exposures by antibody detection can also test the hypothesis that risk
of the viral infection itself varies by race/ethnicity, rather than only a subsequent COVID19 illness being associated with race/ethnicity.
Fewer seroprevalence studies of racial and geographic disparities have been
reported to date, relative to comparisons of virus RNA-based COVID-19 case
surveillance. These studies suggest there are racial/ethnic disparities in SARS-CoV-2
infection, although they have some limitations and inconsistent results. One early study
of fingerstick blood specimens collected at grocery stores in New York state observed
significantly higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
protein, assessed as detectable versus not detectable antibody, among Latinx, Black,
and Asian adults relative to white adults (21). Another study in Baton Rouge using the
qualitative Abbott SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleocapsid IgG nucleoprotein enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assay (ARCHITECTTM platform) was not indubitably
confirmatory, as it found much smaller differences. Weighted seroprevalence was 9.8%
among participants who were Black, 7.1% multiracial, 5.5% Asian, 4.5% White, and
5.3% Hispanic; confidence intervals were non-overlapping except for Asian and
Hispanic (22). Both reports had the limitation that the qualitative anti-nucleocapsid
antibody assays used have been reported to not be as sensitive and specific as
quantitative ELISA detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding

domain (RBD) IgG. Previous reports suggest that an anti-RBD IgG assay exhibits
superior performance compared to an anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay (19, 23-26). These
two earlier assessments of racial/ethnic disparities in seroprevalence also relied on inperson collection of samples at a clinical care or research site, which limits reach and
coverage during varying pandemic mitigations such as stay at home orders similarly to
acute virus diagnostic testing.
In Chicago, like many cities, there are large differences in documented rates of
COVID-19 cases and fatalities across neighborhoods that vary in their racial/ethnic and
socioeconomic composition (2). However, the lack of comprehensive seroprevalence
assessments reported to date has not yet enabled analysis of whether SARS-CoV-2
infections are similarly disparate. The current study tested the hypothesis that
geographic disparities in COVID-19 case rates will be mirrored in seroprevalence rates,
using a more sensitive, specific, and quantitative antibody assay than the earlier reports
(21, 22). Moreover, the antibody assay used here is not dependent upon access to inperson testing at care or research sites. To achieve this, we utilized dried blood spots
(DBS) collected in the home setting using a simple finger prick method. This followed
web- and mass media-facilitated participant recruitment and online
screening/consenting. After blood collection, participants’ DBS cards were returned to
the laboratory for testing in pre-paid mailers. We used a previously described the DBSbased quantitative ELISA for IgG to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
protein (27). Our study design offered a strong opportunity to confirm the hypothesis
that geographic disparities would be similar in molecular diagnostic and
serosurveillance assays across 5 pairs of Chicago ZIP codes that both bordered one

another and had very different COVID-19 case rates. Results instead suggest there are
differences in COVID-19 illness between these neighborhoods, but not SARS-CoV-2
infection.
METHODS
All research activities were implemented under conditions of informed consent
with protocols approved by the institutional review board of the university where the
authors are primarily affiliated. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap
electronic data capture tools (28).
To select ZIP code pairs, COVID-19 cumulative case rates by ZIP code were
obtained from Chicago Department of Public Health’s COVID-19 website (2). Additional
health, socio-economic, and demographic ZIP code level data were selected from US
Census Bureau American Community Survey (29) and the Chicago Health Atlas (listed
in Table 2) (30). ZIP codes were ranked based on the CDPH COVID-19 cumulative
case rate for the week of 4/26/20-5/2/20. Low case rate ZIP codes (category 1 or 2) that
were adjacent to high case rate ZIP codes (category 4 or 5) were selected for review. In
cases were multiple touching ZIPs met the criteria, a ZIP was selected based on
additional criteria listed in Table 2. Five ZIP code pairs were chosen based on
geographic location, highest case rates, and these additional socio-economic, health,
and demographic characteristics.
Procedures
To achieve a diverse representation of residents of these ZIP codes, participants
were recruited through two mechanisms. First, community-based participants (n =
1,509) were recruited from ten ZIP codes in Chicago through social media advertising,

outreach to local businesses and community leaders, and news articles about the study.
Participants were screened for eligibility, which included ZIP code residence and age of
18 years or over. To assure racial and gender diversity within the sample, enrollment of
women and white participants (groups that disproportionately completed the screener)
was adaptively matched to enrollment of men and racial-minority participants within
each ZIP code. Second, staff, students and faculty from the Northwestern University’s
Feinberg School of Medicine (FSM) in Chicago, IL were sent an email describing the
study with a link to the website (n = 158 who lived in one of the 10 study ZIP codes).
Eligible participants were invited to complete a questionnaire regarding health status,
including COVID-19 symptoms. Community participants received materials for DBS
collection through the United States Postal Service (USPS) and returned their test kits
using prepaid USPS envelopes provided to them by the study team. Those affiliated
with FSM were given a specific time to collect DBS kits in person and were instructed to
return their completed kits to the same location. The research team developed a video
that explained to participants all of the steps of DBS collection and return (31). Sample
collection occurred between June 24 and November 23, 2020.
We measured antibodies to RBD because previous studies have reported better
sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 infection detection than seen with antinucleocapsid antibodies (19, 23-26). Anti-RBD antibodies have infrequent and low-level
cross-reactivity to other seasonal human coronaviruses (32, 33), an advantage relative
to detection of antibodies to other SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The ELISA protocol we used
has been validated for DBS and previously described (27, 34). Samples were run in

duplicate and reported as the average. Results were normalized to the CR3022
antibody with known affinity (35). A value >0.39µg/ml CR3022 was considered positive.
Statistical analysis
Unadjusted and adjusted binomial logistic regression was performed to compare
seroprevalence within each ZIP code pair. Age, race/ethnicity, gender and prior COVID19 testing result were used as covariates when reporting adjusted odds ratios.
Geographical information system (GIS) analyses were conducted using ArcGIS Pro
2.6.2. Only participants who were geocoded using the StreetAddress or AddressPoint
locator and were geocoded to the ten ZIP codes chosen for analysis were included in
the geospatial analysis (n = 1,666). Data sources for GIS data are indicated in Table 2.
RESULTS
Table 1 reports sample characteristics. A slight majority of the sample was nonLatinx white (54.3%), most had never tested for COVID-19 (71.4%), and the sample
was heterogenous in terms of employment-based SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk. Overall,
the seroprevalence in the sample was 18.7%. As indicated by non-overlapping
confidence intervals in estimates in Table 1, seroprevalence was significantly higher in
Latinx (25.9%) than White non-Latinx (15.6%), and in those who had previously tested
COVID-19 positive (90.2%) than those who had never tested (17.2%) or tested negative
(16.1%).

negative participants within the 10 ZIP codes. Finer grain maps of participants’
residential locations with geographic features overlayed (e.g., highways, train yards,
waterways, etc.; not shown to protect participant confidentiality) suggested an even

distribution of participants within residential spaces in each ZIP code, with the exception
of 60643 in which there were few cases in residential areas east of the interstate
highway. This even distribution suggests a lack of clustering of participants along paired
ZIP code boundaries in a way that would have confounded our analyses of similarities
between case rates and seroprevalence. Multiple approaches to geospatial hotspot
analyses did not demonstrate significant cluster of seroprevalence within ZIP codes.
Table 2 presents characteristics of the 10 ZIP codes included in the study. In
each pair, the ZIP code with the higher case rate is in the column to the left of the ZIP
code with the lower case rate. Cumulative case rates in all ZIP codes increased from
the time when ZIP codes were first selected to the end of data collection, and most ZIP
code pairs were relatively stable in terms of the ratio of reported cases across pairs,
with the exception of pair 5 (60643 and 60655). In this pair, 60655 had a much larger
increase in the case rate than any other ZIP code. Rates of COVID-19 testing by ZIP
code were not available at the time of ZIP code selection, but were subsequently
released. Across pairs, cumulative test numbers in April/May were higher (pairs 1, 2, 4)
in ZIP codes with more cases or similar across pairs (pairs 3, 5). By November, number
of cumulative tests became more similar across pairs. Zip code pairs varied
considerably in certain observed characteristics, such as population size, markers of
healthcare accessibility (i.e., rates of avoidable emergency department visits),
transportation-based exposure risk (i.e., use of public transportation to work), poverty,
and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity of study participants also varied by ZIP code, but nonwhite participants were underrepresented in each. Better representation was achieved
with Latinx participants.

Figure 2 plots SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence vs. cumulative COVID-19 case rates
for each ZIP code pair. Table 3 shows odds ratios of seroprevalence within each of the
5 ZIP code pairs, none of which were significant; even trends across pairs did not
support the hypothesis that adjacent ZIP codes with higher case rates trended towards
a higher seroprevalence based on antibody testing. Adjustments with individual-level
covariates that differ across ZIP codes (e.g., race/ethnicity) did alter some point
estimates but did not change the pattern of significance of results. Analyses weighting
data to census characteristics (not shown) also did not alter the pattern or significance
of findings.
DISCUSSION
In this study we sought to test the hypothesis that geographic differences in
epidemiology of COVID-19 based on case reports would be confirmed in a
seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Our
comparison of 5 adjacent ZIP codes with substantially different COVID-19 case rates at
the time of selection did not confirm this hypothesis. In unadjusted, adjusted, and
weighted analyses, there were no significant differences in seroprevalence between ZIP
codes in the same pair. This suggests little association between case rates by ZIP code
and infection rates as estimated by serosurveillance.
There are several possible explanations for why seroprevalence may not track
case rates. First, it is possible that our seroprevalence study provided a better
representation of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology than case rates. We used a highly
sensitive assay (27), and therefore likely detected positive individuals who were
asymptomatic and never sought testing. At times, diagnostic testing in Chicago was

unavailable or extremely restricted, and therefore even symptomatic individuals were
not tested; these untested individuals would have been identified as having had COVID19 with this antibody screen. Further, participants in the current study could be
screened for antibodies by providing a sample they collect at home, and even when
diagnostic testing was available, some individuals feared leaving their home to go to
testing spaces. Along these same lines, serological antibody testing is a marker of past
infections, whereas PCR diagnostic testing only detects active infections. If serology is
indeed a more accurate representation of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, it would suggest
that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may have been more widespread than is indicated by
case rates. This conclusion is also supported by a recent study comparing
seroprevalence to case rates in 10 sites in the U.S. (36).
Second, it is possible that, due to the sensitivity of the assay used in our study,
we detected individuals who had lower doses of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus at the
time of exposure, which may be associated with an asymptomatic or less intense
clinical presentation (37, 38). If this is true, then observed variation in case rates across
ZIP codes may actually represent differences in severity of illness. Individuals with a
larger exposure doses may have an increased likelihood of experiencing symptoms and
subsequently receiving diagnostic testing. Thus, individuals across these ZIP code pairs
may not differ in their rates of actual exposure, but instead in their dose of exposure. If
this is the case, it suggests that the use of serosurveillance studies to inform public
health action may need to consider the disconnect between detection of any exposure
and clinical risk. Quantitative antibody assays linking levels of antibody response to
clinical presentation may be particularly useful for such research. At the same time,

larger exposure doses would likely be tied to a close proximity between an infected and
uninfected individual, such as those sharing a room in the same home. While 10 ZIP
codes is too few for a formal statistical test, in our study a widely used metric of
residential crowding (% of housing with 1.51+ occupants per room) showed little-to-no
association with ZIP code seroprevalence. Of course, ZIP code level living density is not
synonymous with density assessed at the level of a single home, so future research
should assess number of people in home and in a shared bedroom.
A third possibility is that case rates are closely tied to symptoms, and symptoms
are tied to older age and underlying comorbidities (39), so even in conditions of
constant levels of exposure/infection/transmission across neighborhoods, those with
more social determinants of chronic diseases would tend to have higher case rates—
assuming equal access to testing. When study ZIP codes were selected in April/May,
testing as a proportion of the population was low across all ZIP codes (mean = 8.3%
range 3.1-16.0%), but increased until at study completion most ZIP codes had more
cumulative tests than residents. While the current sample size of 10 ZIP codes is too
small to compute a correlation, the pattern of results does not suggest that diagnostic
testing rates are positively associated with seropositivity. Census markers of poor
healthcare access also did not show a strong positive trend with seropositivity.
Admittedly, these are crude markers of presence of chronic diseases so future studies
should examine additional markers. Overall, this pattern is consistent with more uniform
spread of infections, including those that are asymptomatic, across Chicago ZIP codes
than would be suggested by case surveillance data.

Our study also examined the relationship between individual characteristics and
seropositivity. Differences by age, gender groups, and employment status stratified by
possible exposure risk were not significant. As an epidemiological confirmation of the
validity of the antibody assay used in this study, participants who self-reported a prior
positive COVID test were substantially more likely to be seropositive than those who did
not (90.2% versus 16.1-17.2%). Most racial minority groups trended toward higher
seropositivity, but the only significant difference was between Latinx and White, nonLatinx participants (25.9% versus 15.6%). These findings are consistent with case
surveillance in Chicago, which indicated that at the time of the launch of data collection,
case rates were surging in the Latinx community. As of February 5, 2021, the infection
case rate in the Latinx population was higher than non-Latinx White and Black
combined (10,797.4, 4,851.2, and 5,227.8, respectively)(2). Test positivity rates showed
a similar pattern. Cumulative deaths since the beginning of the pandemic have occurred
substantially more among Black Chicagoans; in fact, this alarming pattern is what
inspired the focus of this study seeking to understand disparities in SARS-CoV-2
spread. Fortunately, these inequities in deaths from COVID-19 have shrunk over time
as death rates overall have declined in the context of more effective prevention and
treatment. This pattern is consistent with some partial role of pre-existing comorbidities
in explaining racial disparities in COVID-19 disease and death; the magnitude or
existence of such an effect is still contested in the existing literature and will require
further research (3, 7, 8). Such an effect would support repeating again the call to
urgently address social determinants of health that produce inequities in chronic
diseases that will exacerbate medical disparities when pandemic occur (40, 41).

Findings must be considered in the context of study limitations. This was not a
probability sample, but instead obtained through social and news media, community
outreach, and employees of a large medical school. Our goal was not to provide
population estimates of seroprevalence, rather we sought to look at relative rates within
pairs of carefully selected adjacent ZIP codes with differing case rates. Nevertheless,
our estimation of seroprevalence within ZIP codes may be biased by our sampling
approach. For example, despite attempts to target recruitment from Black communities,
the proportion of Black participants in the study underrepresented the demographics of
Chicago. We sought to partially correct for this with sensitivity analyses that included
demographic covariates and weighting. Further, individuals who opted to volunteer to
participate when reading about the study through widespread coverage in local news,
social media ads, or community outreach may not represent the entire community.
Second, participants were required to self-collect a DBS sample. Through wellproduced videos and collection materials we hoped to minimize concerns, but selection
biases may still have operated.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may be more consistent
across neighborhoods within Chicago than was previously thought based on reported
COVID-19 case rates. This suggests that factors other than differential seroprevalence
may play a role in driving disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. One possibility is that preexisting chronic conditions are associated with greater risks of symptomatic infection,
leading to higher rates of symptomatic illness and case detection in groups with higher
rates pre-existing chronic conditions. Another possibility is that the average dose of

exposure is higher in some neighborhoods compared to others, leading higher rates of
symptomatic illness and case detection in areas where the intensity of exposure is
greater. Differences in viral dose may occur for a variety of reasons including
differences in adherence to preventive behaviors, work environments, or living
situations. Our results highlight the importance of investigating other factors besides
differential exposure as potential drivers of inequity in COVID-19 outcomes.

Upper 95% CL
Cumulative Case rate per 100 people, week of 11/15 - 11/21

Figure 2. SARS-Cov-2 Seroprevalence rates vs. cumulative COVID-19 case rate by ZIP
code pair. Adjacent ZIP codes with substantial differences in cumulative case rates were
selected and surveyed for seroprevalence. We did not detect statistically significant differences
in seroprevalence between the high case rate ZIP code and the low case rate ZIP code for any
of the pairs surveyed. This suggests that the prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 exposure does not
account for neighborhood differences in COVID-19 case rates.
