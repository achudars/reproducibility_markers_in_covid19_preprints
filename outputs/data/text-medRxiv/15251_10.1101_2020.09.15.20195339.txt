Abstract
Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy,
with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we
investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain
and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course.
Methods. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the
outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixedeffects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial
strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for
multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income.
Findings. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive
symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income.
Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies.
Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one
study (US).
Interpretation. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms
and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety.
Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public
health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID19 has negative implications for mental health.
Funding. This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, the USIsrael Binational Science Foundation, Foundation Dora and Kirsh Foundation.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health1. To reduce virus spread,
many countries have ordered strict measures to impose social distancing2. While such
preventive measures are effective in reducing transmission, their economic costs are
overwhelming3–5. In April 2020, unemployment in the US reached 14·7%, a 10·3 percent
increase compared to the previous month, with 15·9 million newly unemployed workers. This
is the steepest one-month increase since 19483. Similar trends have been observed in other
areas of the world4. The World Bank has estimated that by the end of 2020, international
global gross domestic product (GDP) will decline by up to 5·2%, the worst global recession
in 80 years5. Behind the numbers, reduced GDP means greater unemployment, which is a
major risk factor for worsened mental health6. Unemployment increases psychological strain
as, besides the loss of income, it is accompanied with loss of social contact, status and sense
of competence7. Thus, the economic climate in mid-2020 poses an imminent threat to mental
health deterioration8, adding to the health-related stress invoked by the pandemic. Some
evidence from the 2007 economic crisis suggests that economic stress is specifically
associated with seeking mental health help due to depression9.
Recent findings indicate that the current COVID-19 crisis is no exception, with its economic
impact hitting hard on global mental health. In China, high levels of anxiety and depression
were associated with worries about income, job, study or inability to pay loans10. In a large
nationally representative study conducted in the UK, people who were unemployed or had no
income (e.g. were full-time students) during the pandemic were more distressed than those
employed. Furthermore, people who lost their job during the pandemic expressed greater
increase in distress than individuals who were already unemployed before COVID-1911. This
finding might reflect the link between the sharp decrease in financial security and
deterioration in mental health experienced by many workers; however, this study did not

address the specificity of financial concerns to mental health beyond other concerns such as
COVID-19 health-related worries11. A study from the U.S reported higher rate of depressive
symptoms during the pandemic compared with pre-pandemic, highlighting low household
income and savings as risk factors for depression; however this study did not compare
financial stressors with health-related stressors12. In a study from Switzerland, the impact of
financial concerns on internalizing symptoms (depression, anxiety, self-injury and suicidal
ideation) among young adults (N = 768, mean age 22) exceeded that of health-related
concerns13. This finding is in line with a report that young people are less physically
threatened by the virus, but are more vulnerable to losing their job14. In times of an ongoing
debate about whether economic considerations should be prioritized over health15, there is
need for data to clarify the link between finances and mental health and their trajectories
during COVID-191,16.
We recently described a crowdsourcing platform (covid19resilience.org) that collected data
on COVID-19 related stress (worries) and mental health in population primarily composed of
US and Israel participants sampled during the acute pandemic outbreak17. In the current
research, we investigated the specific association between self-reported financial
consequences of COVID-19 and mental health (anxiety and depression) during the pandemic,
over and above the impact of health-related concerns. We further analyzed data from an
independent study conducted in Israel. In each study we investigated (1) cross sectional
associations between financial hardship and concurrent mental health and (2) mental health
trajectories over a month during the pandemic. We hypothesized that loss of income
(objective financial hardship) and perceptions of financial strain (the subjective feeling of
economic well being18) would be associated with increased anxiety and depression symptoms
and would predict the exacerbation of symptoms over time above and beyond health related

COVID-19 concerns. We further tested whether financial stressors would be uniquely
associated with depression, above and beyond their effect on anxiety symptoms.

Methods
Study 1
Participants and procedure
Participants were ascertained through a crowdsourcing website (https://covid19resilience.org/)
that collected data on COVID-19 related stress (worries), resilience and mental health17. At
the end of the survey, participants received personalized feedback on their responses. The
feedback was meant to incentivize participants to complete the survey carefully. Participants
were offered the opportunity to leave their email address and be contacted for follow up
surveying. The study was advertised through, 1) the researchers’ social networks, including
emails to colleagues around the world; 2) social media; 3) the University of Pennsylvania and
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia internal notifications and websites; and 4) organizational
mailing lists. The survey was available in English and Hebrew. The results presented are
based on data collected from April 6th to May 5th, 2020 for the baseline cross sectional
analysis (T1); Participants who left their email address in T1 and consented to be re-contacted
received an email inviting them to participate in a longitudinal survey between May 12th and
June 21st (T2). Participation required responders to provide online consent. The study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.
Measures
Anxiety and depression were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)
questionnaire19 and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2)20, respectively. COVID-19related worries (self-contracting COVID-19, family contracting COVID-19, financial burden
due to COVID-19) were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale (from not at all to a great

deal). Participants were also asked whether they had lost their job or whether their pay/hours
were reduced since the beginning of the outbreak (collapsed into a binary income loss
measure [yes/no]).
Statistical analysis
Cross sectional models
Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate associations of financial hardship
with mental health (anxiety and depression symptoms) as the dependent variable. In the first
model, we considered income loss (yes/no) as the independent variable. In the second model,
we considered the COVID-19 related financial strain (stress/worry) as the independent
variable, contrasted against the stress of self-contracting COVID-19, which served as the
reference variable for pandemic-related worries. This model also included the stress of a
family member contracting COVID-19. Symptom type (anxiety or depression) was addressed
as within-person repeated measure. Models included multiple potential confounders: age,
gender, pre-COVID-19 annual income (in USD (ordinal measure)), relationship status, living
alone, country of origin and date of survey completion.
Longitudinal models
For the longitudinal analysis we used linear mixed-effects models with the symptoms as the
key dependent variable, where change over time could be observed due to the longitudinal
nature of the data. Model 1 included dynamics (change) in income loss from T1 to T2.
Change in income loss consisted of four possible values (1-0, 0-0, 1-1, 0-1; 0=no loss;
1=loss), where income loss at T2 was considered as deterioration in financial situation (even
if already reported at T1, due to expected regression to the mean). Model 2 considered
change in worries between T1 and T2 and was calculated as the difference in responses
between time-points. Symptom type (anxiety or depression) was addressed as within-person

repeated measure. Covariates were the same as cross-sectional models in addition to duration
between T1 and T2.
All analyses were performed using the lmerTest package21 in R.

Study 2
Participants and procedure
Participants were adult Israelis recruited through a survey link distributed among the
researchers’ social media network (WhatsApp contacts and in public groups on Facebook).
Data were collected between March 18th and 26th (T1), and again between April 22nd and May
7th (T2, for participants who agreed to be re-contacted for longitudinal surveying through
email). All surveys were conducted in Hebrew. Participation required providing online
consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sheba Medical Center.
Measures
We screened for anxiety and depression with the Hebrew version of the Patient-Reported
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety and Depression modules

. COVID-19-related stressors (worries) were compiled from questions that have been

shown to be pertinent to mental health in previous research on the SARS and N1H1
pandemics24, and were measured on a 4-point Likert-type scale (From not at all to always).
Sociodemographic questions were the same as in study 1 with the exception of income (from
considerably below average to considerably above average) and income loss (from no income
loss to extreme income loss) that were measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale.
Statistical analysis
We employed similar models as described in study 1 with a few alterations: The key
dependent variables in the cross-sectional and longitudinal models were PROMIS scores

(instead of GAD7/PHQ2). Income loss was on a 5-point scale (instead of binary in study 1),
therefore change in income loss was also calculated as the difference in responses between
T1 and T2.

Results
Study 1
Sample characteristics
Cross sectional data (T1) was collected from 5 717 participants who completed the resilience
survey and the COVID-19 related questions. Of them, 2 904 people completed GAD-7 and
PHQ-2 and were included in this study. Participants were mostly female (n = 2 259, 77·8%)
with mean age of 41·97 (SD = 13·55; range 18 to 91). 815 participants (28·1%) were in the
top income category (annual income>$150,000), 556 (19·0%) reported they experienced
income loss, and 223 (7·7%) endorsed the top category of financial worries due to COVID19. In the longitudinal survey (T2), data was obtained from 1 318 participants (54·8%
response rate out of n = 2 404 that were re-contacted after providing their email in T1).
Prevalence of females (n = 1 077, 81·7%), mean age (M = 40·79, SD = 13·59), income loss (n
= 246, 18·7%) and high financial strain (n = 99, 7·5%) resembled T1. Cohort characteristics
are presented in Table 1.
Cross sectional association of financial factors with mental health
Higher pre-COVID-19 income was negatively associated with overall anxiety and depression
(GAD7 and PHQ2) symptom load (β = -0.02, SE < 0.01, t (14 070) = -3.41, p < .001).
Income loss during COVID-19 (losing job or reduced pay) was associated with greater
depressive symptoms, but not anxiety (Figure 1A, income loss by symptom type

(anxiety/depression) interaction, p < .0001) and had no main effect on general (anxiety and
depression) symptom load (p = .738).
COVID-19 related worries (self-contracting, family contracting and financial worries) were
associated with greater symptom load (β = 0.13, SE = 0.01, t (15 280) = 13.35, p < .0001).
Financial worries were specifically associated with depressive symptoms (Table 2, financial
worries by symptom type interaction, p < .0001).
Longitudinal association of 1-month dynamics in financial factors with mental health
trajectories
Income loss at T2 was associated with 1-month increase in general symptoms load (β = 0.26).
The increase in anxiety symptoms was steeper than that of depression symptoms (Figure 2A,
Table 3).
Increase in COVID-19 related worries between T1 and T2 was associated with an increase in
general symptoms load (β = 0.13, SE = 0.02, t (7 176) = 6.20, p < .0001). Increase in financial
worries was specifically associated with depressive symptoms (increase in financial worries
by symptom type interaction, p < .035). Full model statistics are summarized in Table 3.

Study 2
Sample characteristics
We conducted similar analysis on a replication cohort from Israel. Of the 1 376 participants
that participated in the survey, 1 267 people completed PROMIS and COVID-19 related
questions, and were included in this study. Participants were majority female (n = 687,
54·2%) with mean age of 35·21 (SD = 12·26). 142 participants (11·7%) were in the top
income category (reporting their income to be considerably above average), 501 (39·5%)
reported that they experienced income loss, and 226 (17·8%) endorsed the top category of

financial worries due to COVID-19. In the longitudinal survey, data was obtained from 241
participants (49·7% response rate out of n = 485 that were re-contacted). Compared with T1,
the follow up sample included higher prevalence of females (n = 166, 68·9%) and lower
prevalence of people who endorsed the top category for COVID-19 related financial strain
(33, 13·7%). Age (M = 37·32, SD = 12·60) and rates of income loss (n = 102, 42·3%)
resembled T1. Cohort characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Cross sectional association of financial factors with mental health
Higher pre-COVID-19 income had no association with general symptoms (PROMIS
depression and anxiety) load (β = 0.02, SE = 0.02, t (2 192) = -1.37, p = .168). Income loss
during COVID-19 was associated with overall higher symptom load (Table 1, standardized
effect=.08, p < .0001). The association of income loss with depression was greater than the
association with anxiety (Figure 1B, income loss by symptom type interaction, p < .0001).
COVID-19 related worries (self-contracting, family contracting and financial worries) were
associated with greater symptoms load (β = 0.11, SE = 0.01, t (6 535) = 7.86, p < .0001).
Financial worries were specifically associated with depressive symptoms (Table 2, financial
worries by symptom type interaction, p < .0001).
Longitudinal (1-month) association of dynamics in financial factors with mental health
trajectories
A negative trend in financial situation (i.e., worsening of income loss by T2 compared to T1)
was associated with 1-month increase in depression (β = 0.07, p = .005), but had no
association with increase in general symptoms load (p = .817, Figure 2B, Table 3).
COVID-19 related worries had a trend-level effect on increase in general symptoms load (β =
0.07, p = .098). Increase in financial worries had no specific association with depressive

statistics are summarized in Table 3.

Discussion
Across two independent studies, we found a specific link between financial factors and
depression, above and beyond anxiety, which was greater than the association between
health-related worries and depression. In cross-sectional analyses of data collected from over
4 000 participants, both loss of income and financial worries had unique effects on depression
in the two studies. In longitudinal analyses of ~1 500 participants, participants from both
cohorts who reported a negative trend in income loss reported an increase in depressive
symptoms over time. A specific effect of income loss and of financial worries on longitudinal
worsening of depressive symptoms, independent of anxiety, was observed in one of two
studies. Our findings are in line with data from previous global crises like the 2008 recession
that showed a link between financial factors and increase in depression25.
The abrupt loss of income (during the pandemic) was associated with overall more anxiety
and depressive symptoms, but was associated more strongly with depression than anxiety
symptoms, in both cohorts. This dissociation between anxiety and depression may indicate
that acute loss of income is a specific risk factor for depression during the pandemic. Our
results from Study 2 suggest that recent income loss (measured on a 5-point Likert scale)
contributes not only to initial depressive response (data collected at the onset of the
pandemic), but may also cause its amplification over time, with a 1-month exacerbation in
depressive symptoms associated with worsening in income loss. While we observed an
increase in depressive symptoms in Cohort 1 over time in association with income loss, this
effect was also observed with worsening of anxiety, even to a larger extent. It is possible that
demographic differences between the two cohorts may explain this difference in findings, as

Cohort 1 was sampled from a wealthier population that was likely to have more “financial
buffering” capacity (i.e., savings, other financial resources beyond salary), and therefore the
impact on depression may not have been pronounced. It is also possible that the binary
measure that we had used in Cohort 1 to capture income loss (losing job/reduced pay) did not
allow sufficient variability in the data to specifically link the worsening of income loss with
depression. Our results are in line with recent COVID-19-related data12 and with previous
findings from economic crises, which associated unemployment and financial difficulties
(e.g., mortgage repayment difficulties, evictions, financial shortage ranging from difficulty in
paying loans to paying at the supermarket, etc.) with increased depression and help-seeking
behaviors9,25.
The link we observed between COVID-19 stress (worries) and depression was specific to
financial worries. Health-related worries about contracting COVID-19 or family contracting
it were associated with general symptoms load, but not depression specifically. This finding
controlled for pre-COVID-19 income, suggesting that the objective financial situation only
partly explains variability in depressive symptoms, and that worries about the financial
situation may be a sensitive marker (red flag) for depressive symptoms during the pandemic.
Coupled with the finding that objective income loss is tied to depressive symptoms and that
the results replicated across two independent cohorts, our data converge to support the
specific link between financial stressors and depressive symptoms. Previous works have
shown that financial strain - the subjective stress about financial concerns - is associated with
deterioration in mental health, even more than objective inability to meet financial
requirements18,26.
The urgent need for solid scientific data on the pandemic’s effect on health has spurred
concerns regarding validity and generalizability of COVID-19 related publications27. That
our cross-sectional results were replicated across two independent cohorts is a strength of the

current study, and enables generalization of the findings beyond a local perspective. It also
mitigates the risk that our conclusions ensue from a type I error. The cohorts differed in terms
of demographics - Cohort 1 being multinational (primarily US and Israel), composed mainly
of highly educated people, enriched with healthcare providers and having a high prevalence
of women compared with Cohort 2, which had a larger proportion of students and young
adults, was more balanced in terms of gender distribution, and composed of Israeli population
exclusively. In addition, that the two studies used different measurements and still results
generally replicated across studies further supports the generalizability of our findings to
other populations globally and augurs well for the internal validity of the data.
In light of the urgent dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between
health and economy28, the results of this study may have several implications for
policymakers. We show here that the economic impact, which is strongly driven by lockdown
policies, may have significant mental health implications like increase in depression. Due to
the rising concerns regarding increased suicide risk in the face of the pandemic29, the possible
link between the financial impact of COVID-19 and depressive symptoms may be a red flag
for policy makers as they determine policies of reopening the economy. Thus, our study
emphasizes the importance of maintaining balance between necessary social distancing and
minimization of economic slowdown. In addition, our findings can guide clinicians as they
encounter patients during the pandemic, suggesting that healthcare providers should actively
probe patients for a change for the worse in their income, and ask them specifically about
their subjective stress regarding the financial impact of COVID-19. Our results may suggest
that these financial stressors are sensitive markers for the development of depression.
Importantly, our results suggest that the impact of income loss and financial strain on
depressive symptoms are independent of pre-COVID-19 income. We therefore suggest that
people from all backgrounds who report stress about their financial situation during the

pandemic, including those with high income, are vulnerable to the effects of the financial
crisis on mental health, and therefore no one should be overlooked for their increased risk for
depression.
This study had several limitations. First, the sampling was not random, rather we employed a
“snowball” recruitment in both cohorts through the investigators’ social networks. Therefore,
potential biases that were reported recently in online surveys during COVID-19 should be
considered27. Second, we had substantial attrition between T1 and T2 in both studies,
especially in Cohort 2, where we were likely underpowered to test longitudinal trajectories.
Therefore, a type II error is possible. Third, in Cohort 1, the measure for income loss was
binary, which limited us in assessing variability in the trajectory over time. Lastly, our study
employed online crowdsourcing data collection, with all of its inherent limitations as
participants were not interviewed in person30. Still, arguably even when accounting for the
limitations mentioned above, that overall the association between objective (income loss) and
subjective (financial worries) financial factors with depressive symptoms was replicated in
two independent studies mitigates most concerns regarding generalizability of our findings.
To conclude, we provide converging evidence to suggest a specific association between
financial stressors and depression during a global pandemic. A decrease in income during this
time, as well as perceived financial strain, can lead to deterioration in mental health and
might generate depression in a specific manner. Our findings may suggest that the “financial
COVID-19” could have a serious impact on health, specifically mental health, which should
be gravely considered by policy makers as they decide steps resulting in economic slowdown
due to COVID-19 specific physical health concerns. In light of the growing concern about
increase in suicide following the pandemic29, our findings provide empirical data collected
during the pandemic that may help the efforts to improve early detection of and intervention
with people at increased risk for depression. Future research could focus on early
