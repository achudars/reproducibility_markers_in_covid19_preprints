Abstract:
Introduction Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than
3000 (including clinical diagnosis) healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China. This
study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of
HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient
sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured
questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate
the participants’ risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire
was used to identify the participants’ immediate psychological status. Descriptive
statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were
compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences.
Result A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones
(94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues
(72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and
medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress,
especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been
isolated and having family members or colleagues infected.
Conclusions The finding indicating that, faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs,
especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risks of infection and protective
measures, resulting in psychological distress, so further actions should be taken.

INTRODUCTION
Since December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 has developed in Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China, surrounding the epicenter of Huanan Seafood Market, a
local wet market. In the following weeks, the epidemic had spread rapidly, with
the number of suspected and confirmed cases steadily rising, resulting in a
magnitude of distribution far exceeding that of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in 2003. More than 60,000 HCWs are participating in handling and
treating the COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. COVID-19 is characterized by its
unambiguous capacity of person-to-person transmission1 2, which was not clearly
recognized initially. As a consequence, the protection for HCWs was sub-optimal,
and occupational exposures and infections were frequent.3
As the number of cases climbed up at a great speed, panics prevailed among the
general population and the capacity of local fever clinics was soon overwhelmed.
The speedily increasing number of COVID-19 cases prevented some confirmed
or suspected patients from receiving timely treatment. As a result, tensions and
anxieties were further fueled between patients and HCWs, with violence against
the latter occurring. By February 3

， a total of 20,438 confirmed cases, 23,214

suspected cases and 425 deaths had been reported in 31 province-level
administrative regions in China.4 And familial clusters are also observed.2 Under

such a medical and social background, HCWs are facing a multitude of
challenges: an abrupt outbreak of epidemic, a steep-ascending workload, a
substantial risk of occupational exposure and violence, a high risk of infection of
themselves and their family members, and insufficient supply of protective
materials. The psychological response of overloaded HCWs is of great
importance with regard to the effect of the defense against the epidemic. We
therefore investigated the general condition of HCWs in the early phases of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan as well as their perception of risks and
psychological states.
METHODS
Study design and Participants
The study was a cross-sectional survey, a convenience sample of 4,357 HCWs
from Wuhan, other regions of Hubei province, and other provinces was gathered.
Starting on February 3, 2020, the study lasted for eight days, during which, the
number of confirmed and suspected cases was increasing rapidly. As the
epidemic can be transmitted through droplets and contacts, in order to avoid
interpersonal contacts, structured questionnaires were forwarded online to all
HCWs through social software, and the respondents could decide whether to
participate in the survey. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology, and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT04260308.
Only a single response to the questionnaire was permitted for each person. The

questionnaire consisted of four parts: basic demographic data, the occupational
exposure experience, risk perception of COVID-19, and the General Health
Questionnaire.
Basic demographic data, Exposure to COVID-19 and Risk perception
The information of basic demography was collected, such as age, gender, marital
status and work experience. And the COVID-19 exposure experience was also
recorded in the survey. 6 questions were designed to investigate the participants’
perception of risk to COVID-19, which were assessed on a five-point Likert scale (1.
strongly worried; 2. worried; 3. not sure; 4. not too worried; 5. not worried at all), with
score points of 1 to 5 assigned, a lower score indicating a higher level of concern. The
6 questions are: 1. Are you worried about getting infected with COVID-19 yourself? 2.
Are you worried about your family members getting infected with COVID-19 from you?
3.Are you worried about medical violence? 4. Are you worried about colleagues at the
frontline (direct contact with the COVID-19 patients)? 5. Are you worried about
inadequate protective measure? And 6. Are you worried about the current grassroots
prevention and control strategy?
GHQ-12
General Health Questionnaire is a widely accepted mental health measurement, with
high reliability and validity. It has been translated into many languages and used in
many countries. Moreover, GHQ-12 showed a high positive rate in the evaluation of
people’s psychological state after the SARS epidemic 5 6 and Wenchuan earthquake7 8
in Chinese population. We adopted the scoring method of 0-0-1-1.9 During the study

period, the workload of HCWs was huge. Take Wuhan as an example: on February 3,
2020, a total of 8,279 COVID-19 patients were admitted in 28 designated hospitals.10
In order not to increase the burden of HCWs, we chose only 12 questions to screen
out the HCWs who may have psychological distress and need attention and
intervention in a simple and convenient way.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed by using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions 22.0
(SPSS 22.0). We first analyzed the exposure experience to COVID-19, and then
compared different region groups by means of chi-square tests. Independent t-test
and ANOVA test were used to analyze the five-point Likert scale. Finally, variables
significant at the level 0.05 were included in multivariate analysis to identify the
independent prognostic factors of psychological distress.
Patient and Public Involvement statement
Our study was carried out on HCWs, PPI representatives worked with us to refine the
research question. We have invited HCWs participated in this study to help us
develop our dissemination strategy.

During the study period, 1,404 (32.2%) of the 4,357 HCWs were participating in the
frontline treatment of COVID-19 patients. Among the 1,339 (30.7%) HCWs enrolled in
Wuhan, 516 (38.5%) were participating in the frontline treatment, including 133
doctors (25.8%) and 326 nurses (63.2%). In this study, 40 HCWs were infected with
COVID-19, 33 of whom were from Wuhan, 6 from other areas of Hubei province, and
only one from other provinces. 89.9% of the respondents expressed their willingness
to participated in the treatment. Compared with other regions, COVID-19 exposure
was even more severe in Wuhan. COVID-19 exposure experiences differentiated by
locations are depicted in Table 2.

Risk perception
The main concerns of HCWs were: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family
members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). Only
34.7% of HCWs expressed very worried about the risk of self-infection. About half of
the respondents expressed confidence (46.3%) or high confidence (9.1%) in the
current grassroots prevention and control strategy. The distribution of risk perception
is shown in Figure 1.
However, 40% of frontline HCWs expressed very worried about getting infected,
significantly higher than other three groups; and the score of Likert scales were much
lower (F=49.55, p=0.000). We found that compared with other regions, all of the 6
questions had lower scores, showing significant statistical differences in Wuhan. And
the HCWs in Wuhan had insufficient confidence in the current prevention and control
strategy.
In different treatment division of labor, nurses were more worried about their own
infection at work than doctors, technicians and support personnel (F = 33.262, p=
0.000).
Female respondents were more worried about infection and violence, and those who
had children were more worried about family members’ infection (F = 59.472, p=
0.000) and medical violence (F = 3.056, p= 0.080).

Psychological status
The scores of GHQ-12 for the general population were in a positive skew distribution,
with a score range of 0-12 and a median of 2 (SD: 2.56). Taking the total score of 3 as
the cut-off value, ≥ 3 points is considered a case that there may have psychological
distress, which needs further confirmation and intervention. Of the 4,357 HCWs,
1,704 (39.1%) had psychological distress.
Through the analysis of the basic demography and COVID-19 exposure experience,
the relevant factors affecting the mental health of the HCWs were confirmed. Through
one-way ANOVA test, 8 demographic data (gender, age, location, occupation, work
life, hospital level, marital status and fertility status) and 6 work exposure conditions
(participating in the frontline treatment, having been isolated, getting infected, having
family members infected, having colleagues infected, and volunteering for treatment)
were all related to the psychological state. Through multiple factor regression analysis,
it was found that women, working in Wuhan area and working in primary hospitals
were poor prognostic factors. In terms of COVID-19 exposure history, poor prognostic
factors include participating in frontline treatment, involuntarily participating in
treatment work, having been isolated, and having family members or colleagues
infected, while whether the respondents themselves have got infected or not was not
an independent prognostic factor of psychological disorder. Risk factors for GHQ are
depicted in Table 3.

DISCUSSION
Since mid-December 2019 when COVID-19 broke out in Wuhan, it has spread rapidly.
Since January 23, 2020, the city blockade has been carried out in Wuhan, and traffic
restrictions were enforced throughout China. People in Wuhan, even across China,
live on the horizon of COVID-19. The pathogen of this disease has been identified as
coronavirus, which has 86.9% nucleotide sequence homology with the bat SARS-like
coronavirus genome.11 According to the official statistics, 44,745 cases had been
diagnosed in China, and 398 in areas out of China, until the day this study ended,
February 11, 2020. Its impressing ability of spreading contagion exceeds SARS in
2003.12
In the initial stage, this disease didn’t arouse enough attention from administration
departments, and the Chinese traditional Spring Festival accelerated the spread of
epidemic across the whole nation, because the Spring Festival is the largest
population migration annually. The arrival of the Spring Festival cut the medical

protection industry’s capacities, which further aggravated the phenomenon of
insufficient protection. The rapidly uprising number of patients, and the public panics
after it proved highly contagious, plus shortage of protective supplies and frequent
occurrences of violent events in medical facilities

, seemed to make medical

burdens even heavier. 1,716 HCWs were infected and 6 staff died of this disease,
according to the Chinese official announcement, which is thought to be incomplete
statistics. We should pay more attention to HCWs' psychological tolerance, especially
those fighting at the frontline of controlling the plaque.
In this study, we used GHQ-12 to identify the mental health of HCWs. The criterion for
determining suspected mental health problems is defined as a score of ≥3 points. The
survey results of Chinese residents by using the GHQ-12 questionnaire showed that
the positive rate of residents with a GHQ-12 score of ≥3 points is about
12.8%-21.18%.14 Many studies have used this scale to evaluate scores of HCWs in
different countries, showing a positive rate of 25% -32%.14-16 A survey of frontline
HCWs in Hong Kong during the period of SARS through GHQ-12 questionnaire
showed 57% having experienced psychological distress.17 In this study, 39.1% of
respondents were with GHQ-12 score ≥3, it is suggested that the incidence of
psychological abnormality was significantly higher than that in normal times.
A higher proportion of HCWs from Wuhan showed psychological abnormalities. As
Wuhan is the epidemic focus of COVID-19, there are a huge number of patients, high
rate of severe illness and high mortality. Due to the shortage of HCWs in Wuhan, they

reported that their relatives were infected, while only 2.5% and 0.9% in other regions
of Hubei and other provinces, respectively. And in Wuhan, the COVID-19 infecting
rate among HCWs is much higher than other regions, reaching 20.2%. 58.3%
respondents in Wuhan indicated their colleagues were infected, while only 18.4% and
3.7% in other regions of Hubei and other provinces, respectively. In Wuhan, 38.5% of
the HCWs directly participated in the frontline treatment of the COVID-19 patients.
And through multiple regression analysis, we found that psychological abnormality
rate was much higher in the frontline HCWs. It is easy to understand that the frontline
HCWs needed to contact COVID-19 patients directly and might be equipped with
insufficient protective measures at any time, so they show more concerns for their
own safety. Similarly, nurses had longer periods of contacts with patients; and in the
infectious departments, because of no caregivers allowed in, nurses needed to take
care of all the life of patients, thus more worried about getting infected. However,
although the proportion of nurses with psychological disorder was higher than that of
other professions, there was no significant difference. In primary hospitals, the lack of
protective measures was more obvious, and primary HCWs lacked experience in
treating critical illness, so there was a higher rate of psychological distress.
Before and during the period of COVID-19 epidemic, incidents of violence against
HCWs occurred in some parts of the country, including in Wuhan. In answering the
questions on risk perception, 56.8% of the health workers said they were very worried
about the medical violence, while 43.7% and 48.3% in other regions of Hubei and
other provinces, respectively. How to prevent the medical violence and protect the

HCWs in the upfront line of defense against COVID-19 is another critical problem for
Chinese health administration.
Our study showed that 10.1% of HCWs enrolled were not willing to participate in the
COVID-19 treatment tasks, and the risk of abnormal mental state of these
respondents was 2.3 times higher than that of voluntary ones. There was a higher risk
of psychological abnormality among HCWs who had been or were being isolated or
had family members or colleagues infected. Familial clusters of pneumonia
associated with COVID-19 were also observed in and out of Wuhan.2 More than half
of the respondents expressed concerns about their family and colleagues in risk
perception questionnaire. Impressively high contagion rates, long incubation periods
and numerous asymptomatic virus carriers18 19 may mainly contribute to the HCWs’
concern over their family members, since doctors can’t distinguish the COVID-19
infector in their common clinical work. Some communities even prohibited HCWs from
entering the community after work, believing that they may be the potential source of
infection, which further aggravated the remorse of HCWs and their concern for their
families. As a result, most HCWs have to separate from their families, which further
weakens the support from their families. Nevertheless, 89.9% of HCWs voluntarily
participated in the frontline treatment of COVID-19.
Only 34.7% of HCWs expressed in the risk perception questionnaire they were very
worried about the risk of self-infection. Interestingly, it seems that there is no
significant difference in psychological state between respondents with or without
self-infection, which is quite unexpected for us. Previous studies of SARS have shown

that supports from colleagues, clear instructions and strict precautions helped HCWs
cope better with SARS and that they were less likely to develop psychological
abnormalities.20 A number of studies have suggested that when medical workers are
overburdened, their feeling too much responsibility for work, facing the uncertainty of
work and ambiguity of role, short of training, and lack of support from superiors and
colleagues, are all important exogenous factors causing occupational stresses on
medical workers.21 The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in a large number of
patients in need of admission and treatment; other professional doctors were also
engaged in infectious disease work; medical facilities were incomplete; materials were
in short supply; management processes were out of order; and medical personnel
were in great shortage due to colleagues’ infection and quarantine-- all of these cases
aggravated the occupational tension. However, in the context of epidemic disease
such as SARS and COVID-19, HCWs fell into a state of unstainable work that they
could not give up, resulting in the moral heroism and altruism of the medical group 22,
as well as the extreme sacrifice of the group, which led to the decline of HCWs’
attention to themselves.
LIMITATIONS
This study has several limitations. First, because of the disease outbreak, we were
unable to conduct face-to-face interviews; second, the results are limited by the use of
convenience sampling , which could not reflect the overall status of HCWs in China;
and third, due to the time constraints, the scale we used is so simple that it can only
provide a preliminary screening, further confirmation and intervention are needed.

CONCLUSION
In the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried
about the risk of infection and protective measures, causing 39.1% of them to have
developed psychological distress.
The prevention and control of epidemics should not rely on the sacrifice of a single
group. In the subsequent fight against COVID-19 epidemic, adequate protective
materials, enough rests, standard operations, protection training for non-infectious
medical professionals and strengthening the family support for HCWs are urgent
issues. Until this paper was submitted, the novel coronavirus has spread to 73
countries on all continents except Antarctic, European Union raised coronavirus risk
level to high from moderate. HCWs in other countries may be confronted with similar
difficulties as those in China, and we hoped that their demands and psychological
state would be concerned early.
