Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people all across the world. As a result,
there has been a collective effort to monitor, predict, and control the spread
of this disease. Among this effort is the development of mathematical models
that could capture accurately the available data and simulate closely the futuristic scenarios. In this paper, a fractional-order memory-dependent model
for simulating the spread of COVID-19 is proposed. In this model, the impact
of governmental action and public perception are incorporated as part of the
time-varying transmission rate. The model simulation is performed using the
two-step generalized exponential time-differencing method and tested for data
from Wuhan, China. The mean-square errors demonstrate the merit of the
fractional-order model and provide a good estimate of the optimal order.
Keywords: COVID-19, Memory-dependent SEIR, Exponential time
differencing, fractional models, Epidemiology models.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus pandemic, COVID-19, has impacted all aspects of our
life and the disease continues to threaten global economy, public health, human
interactions, and safety. Since the outbreak of the disease, there has been a
collective effort to monitor, predict, and control its spread. For this purpose,
different biological and non-biological techniques, tools, interventions, analysis,
and experiments have been employed to understand the dynamics of disease
spread.
Epidemiological mathematical models continue to play a pivotal role in understanding, capturing and predicting the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, first-order models such as SIR, SEIR, and many others, are intensively

explored to mimic the collected data and make effective predictions. In the
recent months, several such models have been developed to understand and
predict the transmission of COVID-19 pandemic. See for example [1, 2].
Fractional-order models have been recognized as a powerful mathematical
tool to study anomalous behaviors observed in many physical processes with
prominent memory and hereditary properties. In general, such properties might
not be satisfactorily captured by the integer-order counterpart models. This
motivated researchers to consider fractional-order compartmental models for
better understanding of dynamics of infectious diseases such as Dengue fever
[3, 4], Influenza [5], and recently COVID-19 [6].
In this article, we propose and simulate a system of fractional order differential equations for the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed model
uses the time varying transmission rate given in [1] and [7] which incorporates
the effects of governmental actions and public perception. Since the focus is to
provide adequate study and simulation of the fractional order model, we adopt
the two-step generalized time differencing GETD2 scheme developed by Garrappa and Popolizio in [8] to obtain the numerical results. However, to achieve a
cost-effective implementation of this scheme, we use the partial fraction decomposition of the global Padé approximants of the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler
function [9].
The merit of the proposed fractional model is highlighted by examining the
mean square errors between the predicted and reported data in [10]. In addition,
an approximation of the optimal fractional order is obtained by minimizing
these error. This feature can be used to make better data fitting for subsequent
predictions.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Next, the memory-dependent
SEIR model is introduced. The computational algorithm is described in Section
3. The simulation results are presented and discussed in Section 4.
2. Memory-Dependent COVID-19 Model
Following [1], we assume the total population N at any given time to be
distributed among the four compartments: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and
recovered, labeled by S, E, I and R, respectively. That is,
N (t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t).
The assumed dynamics among these populations is depicted in Figure 1 and
can be describes as follows:
• Susceptible individuals enter the exposed compartment at the rate βI/N ,
where β is a nonlinear transmission rate.
• Exposed individuals progress to the infectious compartment at the rate σ,
while the infectious individuals recover from the disease at a rate γ.
• The population is assumed to have a natural death rate µ.

Furthermore, we consider a variable P (t) to represent the public perception on
the risk of the pandemic. This quantity increases with the number of infections
at a rate φ × γ, where φ is the proportion of severe cases, and diminishes over
time at a rate λ.
The values σ −1 , γ −1 , and λ−1 can be interpreted as the mean latent period, mean infectious period, and mean duration of public reaction, respectively.

These quantities together with µ, and β all have units of (time) .

In the special case q = 1, the model in (1) reduces to a modification of COVID19 model introduced in [1].
As observed in the right-hand sided of (1), the qth power of the parameters
is used as suggested by Diethelm [3] and Angstmann et al. [11]. This is necessary to ensure the consistency in units since the left-hand side has the units of
(time)−q .

where ν is the strength of governmental action, β0 is the baseline transmission
rate, and κ is the intensity of individual reaction. Note that the transmission
rate decreases as the perception of risk per individual P/N and the strength of
action ν increase. Moreover, the transmission rate reduces to the baseline rate
β0 in the absence of governmental action and lack of any perception of risk.

As seen in (4) and (5), the implementation of GETD2 scheme involves matrixvector products for the Mittag-Leffler function of a matrix.
This implementation can be carried out using the technique discussed in [8].
However, that approach is costly. For efficient implementation of the GETD2
scheme, we use a technique based on the partial fraction decomposition of the
global Padé approximant of type (7, 2) developed in [9] for the Mittag-Leffler
function.
4. Model Simulation
In this section, we present the numerical simulations and demonstrate the
effectiveness of model (1) in matching the reported data. For this purpose, we
use the parameters given in [1] for China, namely,
β0 = 0.5944,

µ = 0.0205,

σ −1 = 3,

γ −1 = 5,

φ = 0.2,

λ−1 = 11.2 .

As per the lockdown records of Chinese Administrative Division, we take ν = 0
for the first 16 days (Jan 20 – Feb 4) and ν = 0.8478 for the period Feb 5 –
March 6, together with κ = 1117.3. The initial populations are
N0 = 14000000,

E0 = 1000,

I0 = 0,

R0 = 0.

On the other hand, due to the infection-free initial condition, the initial perception P0 is 0.
In Figures 2 and 3, the simulations highlight the main advantages of adopting the fractional order model (1). With the extra parameter q, the model
has a better capability of capturing the reported data. In particular, the model
performs quite well in capturing the peak and slow decay of the infectious population. This is asserted by examining the mean square errors which also indicate
that q = 0.955 is a good approximation of the optimal order. The model with
optimal fractional order can then be used to make future predictions.
In Figure 4, the transmission rate corresponding to different values of governmental action ν and intensity of human behavioral response κ are depicted.
As observed, for fixed intensity κ and fractional order q, the transmission rate
decreases significantly as the governmental action increases. Similar impact is
observed when the intensity κ is increased.
Overall, the obtained results emphasize the robustness of the fractional-order
model as a generalization of the integer-order model.
Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a nonlinear fractional order model to study the
dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. Using the data of the outbreak in Wuhan,
China, the effectiveness of the proposed model in simulating the spreading of the
disease is demonstrated. By examining the mean square error of the predicted
number of infections in our model and the reported data, we found that the
proposed fractional model gives better prediction of the reported data than the
integer order model.
