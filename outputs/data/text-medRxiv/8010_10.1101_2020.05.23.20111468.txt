Abstract: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally and the
meteorological factors vary greatly across the world. Understanding the effect of
meteorological factors and control strategies on COVID-19 transmission is critical to contain
the epidemic. Using individual-level data in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and
the number of confirmed cases in other regions, we explore the effect of temperature, relative
humidity, and control measures on the spread of COVID-19. We found that high temperature
mitigates the transmission of the disease. High relative humidity promotes COVID-19
transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is
high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease.
However, due to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic infections, the effect of the measures to
shorten onset-to-isolation time is markedly reduced and the importance of contact tracing and
quarantine and social distancing increases. The analytic results also highlight the importance of
early intervention to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Introduction
An outbreak of viral pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 occurred in
Wuhan, China in December 20191,2. The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has
exhibited high human-to-human transmissibility and rapidly spread to other Chinese
provinces, as well as 213 other countries, areas, or territories3,4. As of 30 April 2020, a total of
3,090,445 confirmed cases and 217,769 deaths have been reported by WHO4. Wilson et al.5
estimated that different levels of control (via contact reduction) will cause 22% to 63% of the
population in European countries sick, 0.20% to 0.60% hospitalized, and 0.07% to 0.28% dead.
At present, no effective treatment or vaccine is available for COVID-19. The only
approaches to contain the spread of the epidemic are classical control measures, such as social
distancing, isolation of confirmed cases, and contact tracing and quarantine. Understanding the
effect of these control measures on COVID-19 transmission is critical for containing the spread
of the virus. Moreover, the effectiveness of these control measures on virus transmission may
vary with meteorological conditions such as temperature and relative humidity6–8.
To investigate the effect of meteorological factors and control measures on the spread of
COVID-19, we first browsed and downloaded all reports published on the official websites of
local health commissions in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Then, we built a
dataset containing the number of onset cases at the beginning of the outbreak in China, the
individual information of travel history, symptom onset, seeking care at a hospital or clinic, and
isolation date for all patients in 11 provinces in mainland China (Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang,
Tianjin, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Yunnan, Anhui, and Chongqing), the individual
information of all the cases confirmed from 1 to 30 April 2020 in mainland China, and the
individual information reported by 17 March 2020 in Hong Kong and Singapore3,9–22. The
other provinces in mainland China only partially disclosed the epidemic information of the
patients confirmed before 1 April 2020. For Hong Kong and Singapore, certain epidemic

information, such as isolation date, is not publicly available after 17 March 2020. We also
obtained the doubling time of confirmed cases in the countries with no less than 180 cases by
25 March 202023.
Using an extended susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR) model and the
above data, we first estimated the transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers in
mainland China and Hong Kong. Then, using the transmission rates of the provinces in
mainland China and the doubling time of confirmed cases in 69 countries outside China,
together with the daily temperature and relative humidity obtained from World Weather
Online24, we analyzed the role of temperature and relative humidity in COVID-19
transmission. Thereafter, the effect of control measures is analyzed based on the detailed
information on the time of symptom onset and isolation, and the estimated epidemiological
parameters, such as transmission rate and pre-symptomatic transmission period. Finally, we
evaluate the effect of classical control measures on COVID-19 transmission in different
regions when the weather in the northern hemisphere warms up.

Results
Role of meteorological factors in COVID-19 transmission
COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
which is the seventh coronavirus known to infect humans25,26. Previous studies have shown
that meteorological factors, such as temperature and humidity, may influence the survival and
spread of human coronaviruses 229E, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV6-8. However, the role of
temperature and humidity in COVID-19 transmission has not yet been clearly established.
The transmission rate of the virus is mainly affected by meteorological factors and social
distancing measures. Almost the same level of control measures was implemented across the
provinces in mainland China27. That is, the effect of social distancing measures is naturally
controlled in the data. Therefore, using multiple regression, we clearly see the effect of

temperature and relative humidity on the transmission rate of COVID-19. The regression
results (Table 1) show that temperature has a negative effect and humidity has a positive effect
on the transmission rate of COVID-19. The transmission rates are initially estimated using the
extended SEIR model by setting the incubation period to 6.24 days, which is estimated based
on our data. To check the robustness of the results in Table 1, we further estimate the
transmission rates using the mean incubation periods of 5.80 days28 and 5.50 days29. The
results are qualitatively the same, as shown in Tables S1 and S2 in supplementary information.
Previous research of the human coronaviruses 229E shows that high relative humidity has
a positive effect on coronavirus transmission when temperature is low but a negative effect
when temperate is high30. The results in Table 1 are derived using the data from China when
temperature is low. To develop a more holistic picture, we further analyzed the effect of
temperature and relative humidity on the doubling time of confirmed cases in 69 other
countries with at least 180 confirmed cases by 25 March 2020.
As the early cases in other countries are often imported, analyzing the local transmission of
COVID-19 using the reported cases in the very beginning is inappropriate. Most cases in 8 of
the 69 countries are imported until 60 cases are confirmed23. Therefore, to investigate the local
transmission of the virus, we analyze the doubling time of confirmed cases when at least 70
cases have been confirmed in the countries. Moreover, the two countries, Russia and Pakistan,
in which most cases are imported until 180 cases are confirmed are excluded from the
sample23. We first use the duration from the 80th to 160th confirmed cases to represent the
doubling time. The regression results (Table 2) show that temperature negatively relates to
COVID-19 transmission. The effect of relative humility is moderated by temperature. High
humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low but tends to reduce
transmission when temperature is high. We also performed linear regression analyses using the

durations from 70th to 140th and 90th to 180th confirmed cases and derived similar results
(Tables S3 and S4).
Measures to reduce the infectious period
Various control strategies can be applied to contain the spread of COVID-19. To find
appropriate control strategies, we evaluate their effectiveness in reducing the effective
reproduction number
primary case. If

௘

௘,

which is defined as the average number of secondary cases per

exceeds one, the number of cases will increase over time and an outbreak

of the disease is possible. If

௘

is less than one, then the disease will gradually die out. The

effective reproduction number can be reduced in two ways: (1) by reducing the infectious
period of infected individuals and (2) by reducing the person-to-person transmission rate.
Rapid isolation of confirmed cases and timely contact tracing and quarantine are effective to
reduce the infectious period, while social distancing measures, such as travel restrictions and
contact precautions, help decrease the rate of disease transmission.
To examine the effect of classical control measures on infectious period reduction, we
compared the average infectious period including the pre-symptomatic transmission time of
the 11 provinces in mainland China before and after the first-level public health emergency
response. The average infectious period was 9.42 days when few control measures were
implemented. After most control measures were implemented, the average infectious period
decreased to 4.20 days, representing a 55.42% decrease. Among all infected cases, 14.63% of
them were quarantined before symptom onset, which contributed to 25.10% of total infectious
period reduction. For the cases not quarantined, the infectious period was reduced to 4.84 days,
accounting for 74.90% of total infectious period reduction.
However, such aggressive control measures to reduce the infectious period in mainland
China may not be applicable to other regions because of the difference in cultural, political, and
economic contexts. Therefore, we further examined the effectiveness of mild control measures

such as those implemented in the early stage of the outbreak in Hong Kong and Singapore. We
analyzed all the local cases until 29 February. After the mild control measures were
implemented, the average infectious period in Hong Kong decreased from 12.76 to 8.13 days,
representing a reduction of 36.30%. Only 4.76% of patients presenting symptoms were
quarantined, which contributed to 11.88% of total infectious period reduction. The infectious
period of cases not quarantined before the onset of symptoms was reduced to 8.48 days
accounted for 88.12% of the total infectious period reduction. For Singapore, the results are
similar. Only 1.64% of infected cases were quarantined before the onset of symptoms, and the
infectious period decreased from 13.03 to 7.55 days after the control measures were
implemented.
Notably, pre-symptomatic transmission plays a critical role especially when strict
containment strategies are applied. When few control measures were taken in mainland China,
28.66% of secondary cases were infected by the primary cases not showing symptoms yet.
However, after most control measures were implemented to control the epidemic, the
percentage increased to 56.49%. This implies that the effective reproduction number is
129.85% higher than that without pre-symptomatic transmission. To a certain degree, this
finding explains why COVID-19 is much more difficult to control than other coronavirus
infections such as SARS and MERS, of which pre-symptomatic transmission rarely occurs.
Moreover, the detailed information on the 131 local cases presenting symptoms after 1
April 2020, when people in mainland China have returned to normal life, shows that because of
pre-symptomatic transmission, the contribution of contact tracing and quarantine to the total
infectious period reduction increases from 54.56% to 61.94%. On the contrary, the measures to
shorten the onset-to-isolation time contributes 38.06% to the infectious period reduction
compared with 45.44% when no pre-symptomatic transmission occurs. These results indicate
that the effect of treatment and isolation measures for confirmed cases is markedly reduced and

the importance of tracing and quarantine of close contacts increases because of
pre-symptomatic infections.
Measures to reduce transmission rates
Using the simulation results of mainland China, we evaluated the effectiveness of social
distancing measures, such as compulsory mask wearing, closing most workplaces, and
suspending public transport, in reducing the transmission rate. By fitting the number of onset
cases of mainland China from 8 to 31 December, we found that the transmission rate in the
early stage of the outbreak was 0.257, when the control measures were not implemented
(Figure S1 and Table S5). Table S1 shows that the average transmission rate of the 11
provinces was 0.110, when most control measures were implemented. This implies that the
implementation of strict control measures in mainland China reduced the transmission rate by
57.20%.
The relative effectiveness of social distancing increases because of pre-symptomatic
infections. The reduction of

௘

is the combined effect of the reduction in transmission rate and

infectious period. Social distancing measures could decrease

௘

by 57.20% whether

pre-symptomatic infection occurs or not. However, the effectiveness of measures to reduce
infectious period is weakened in the presence of pre-symptomatic infections. These measures
could only decrease

௘

by 55.42% compared with 72.82% in the case of no pre-symptomatic

transmission. Thus, the contribution of social distancing measures to contain the spread of
COVID-19 becomes more prominent compared with the cases without pre-symptomatic
infections.
Timing of intervention
Early intervention is vital for containing the spread of epidemic. Using the epidemic and public
health data of the 11 provinces in China, we investigated the effect of the number of infections
before intervention on the infectious period of patients. The number of hospital beds per 10,000

people from China City Statistical Yearbook-2018 is used as a control variable. Logarithmic
transformation of the variables was performed to normalize the distribution of values. The
results show that the infectious period and thus the effective reproduction number Re increase
with the number of infections before intervention (Table 3).
On the one hand, less medical resources can be used to treat newly infected cases if
hospitals are already full of patients, which inevitably increases the onset-to-isolation time. On
the other hand, large-scale community transmission becomes more possible as more people are
infected before intervention, which increases the difficulty of tracing and quarantining
contacts. Therefore, implementing control measures as early as possible is important to contain
the spread of the disease.

Discussion
We find that temperature negatively relates to COVID-19 transmission. However, the effect of
relative humidity relies on temperature. High humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission
when temperature is low but reduces COVID-19 transmission when temperature is high.
Currently, the temperature of most countries in the northern hemisphere is rising, which
will gradually decrease the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, regions such as Singapore
and Philippines with high temperature and high humidity throughout the year have inherent
advantages of containing the disease spread. In regions such as Japan, the temperature and
humidity increase simultaneously. This greatly favors COVID-19 containment. In regions such
as United States, England, and Spain, the relative humidity is expected to decrease when the
weather becomes warmer. Although suppressing COVID-19 transmission in the regions is
becoming more optimistic, the effect of changing meteorological conditions would be lower
compared with the other regions in the northern hemisphere.
By contrast, the meteorological factors of countries in the southern hemisphere are
becoming more unfavorable to contain the epidemic. For instance, in Australia and South

Africa, control measures of the same intensity are expected to be less effective when the
temperature decreases and the humidity increases. The meteorological data on the above
countries for the past two years are shown in Figure 1.
The outbreak of COVID-19 in Singapore and Philippines shows that high temperature is
not sufficient to contain the epidemic. Implementing stringent measures of social distancing,
contact tracing and quarantine, and treatment and isolation of confirmed cases is important for
controlling the COVID-19 transmission. Owing to the occurrence of pre-symptomatic
infections, the effect of social distancing and contact tracing and quarantine is enhanced. In
mainland China, these two types of measures contributed to 69.26% and 13.91% of the
reduction in

௘,

respectively. Although placing a large number of people in quarantine,

closing most workplaces, and suspending public transportation are costly, the epidemic cannot
be controlled during a short period without these measures when there is already an outbreak of
COVID-19. Both China and South Korea, the countries successfully controlled the spread of
the diseases, implemented strict social distancing and contact tracing and quarantine measures,
such as compulsory mask wearing and digital contact tracing.
However, if workplaces are not closed and individual movements are not restricted, then
the transmission rate cannot be significantly reduced. In such cases, the epidemic still can be
contained if measures to reduce the infectious period, such as contact tracing and quarantine,
and treatment and isolation of confirmed cases, are strictly implemented. Most people in
mainland China have returned to normal life since April 2020. Analyzing the local cases
presenting symptoms after 1 April 2020 shows that the infectious period has been reduced to
2.57 days by quarantining 46.56% of the infected cases before symptom onset and shortening
the onset-to-isolation time. The effective reproduction number is much lower than one in
mainland China as the current transmission rate cannot be higher than 0.257, the transmission
rate at the beginning of the outbreak. This result implies that if the control measures are well

implemented, then the second round of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China is almost
impossible even when individual movements are not restricted. Analyzing the cases showing
symptoms after 1 March 2020 in Hong Kong yields similar results. During this period, 38.46%
of infected cases are quarantined before the onset of symptoms and the infectious period is
reduced to 2.46 days. Moreover, through simulation, we find that the average transmission rate
in Hong Kong is 0.074 (95% CI: 0.037–0.112) (Table S6). This implies that the outbreak of
COVID-19 can be avoided by tracing and quarantining a large proportion of contacts and
reducing the onset-to-isolation time.
This study has several limitations. First, our findings on the relationships between
meteorological factors and the transmission rate of COVID-19 are derived from statistical and
mathematical analyses using real-life data. Highly rigorous controlled medical experiments are
still necessary to show their effect in a laboratory environment. Second, control measures are
mainly evaluated in the context of mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. The differences
in economics, politics, and even culture may lead to varying effects of control measures.
Therefore, an issue that needs to be investigated in a global context is whether the control
measures can be replicated outside these regions.

Methods
An extended SEIR model for estimating transmission parameters
We use an extended SEIR model to describe the transmission process of COVID-19. To the
best of our knowledge, pre-symptomatic transmissions are possible for COVID-19, and a
certain percentage of patients are quarantined before the onset of symptoms in some regions.
Therefore, we extend the original SEIR model by adding the pre-symptomatic transmission
process and the transmission process of the patients quarantined before symptom onset. We
assume that a patient’s infectivity remains constant during the infectious period.

Model Fitting
The model parameters best describing the onset data are identified using the least squares
method. To avoid the influence of imported cases on local transmission, we only simulated
the transmission process when the control measures were implemented and new imported
cases were rare.
For the eleven provinces in mainland China, the time window of the simulation is from
the first day after the first-level public health emergency response when the influence of
imported cases on local transmission is negligible to 10 February 2020 after which few cases
presenting symptoms. To understand the transmission process without intervention, we fitted
the number of onset cases from 8 December 2019 when the first patient presenting symptom
to 31 December 2019 when a cluster of COVID-19 disease cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 are
first reported in mainland China22. For Hong Kong, we studied the local transmission of
COVID-19 from 31 January 2020 when Hong Kong closed its port connecting mainland
China to 6 March 2020 after which the number of onset cases may be underestimated due to
delayed reporting. We used fifteen days’ onset data to fit the model; thus, the simulation
period is from 31 January 2020 to 14 February 2020. Then, we started another simulation
using the symptom onset data from 3 to 17 February 2020. Finally, we obtained eight values
of transmission rate. Figures S1–S12 and Tables S6–S8 present the simulation results.
Meteorological Factors
Data on temperature and relative humidity are collected from World Weather Online24. The
meteorological data of the cities over the world are updated every three hours. The average of
eight values (temperature or relative humidity) in one day is used as the daily value of a city.

The meteorological factors of the 11 provinces are used for the regression analysis on
the transmission of COVID-19 in mainland China. To derive the meteorological factors of the
provinces, we first counted the infected cases in the cities of the provinces before the
first-level public health emergency response. The weight of a city is defined as the ratio of
the infected cases in the city and the total infected cases in the corresponding province. The
mean temperature (relative humidity) of a city are defined as the average temperature
(relative humidity) during the time window of the simulation. For instance, the first-level
public health emergency response was activated on 25 January 2020 in Shaanxi Province.
Accordingly, the time window of the simulation is from 26 January 2020 to 10 February
2020, and the mean temperature and relative humidity are the average values during this
period. Finally, the mean temperature (relative humidity) of a province is calculated as the
sum of the products of the weights of the cities in the province and the corresponding average
temperatures (relative humidities).
We also analyzed the effect of temperature and relative humidity on the epidemic
doubling time in the countries with at least 180 confirmed cases by 25 March 202023. To
derive the meteorological factors of the countries, we first searched the initially reported
cases in a country to determine the province where most of the early cases are infected. Then,
we used the temperature and relative humidity of the provincial capital city to represent those
of the country. To derive the temperature or relative humidity when the cases were infected,
we need to estimate the median incubation period and the median time from symptom onset
to laboratory confirmation. The average median incubation period based on our data and the
relevant literature is five days27,29,31-33. The average time from symptom onset to laboratory
confirmation in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore before implementing strict
control measures is seven days. Therefore, we believe that most of the cases are infected
around 12 days before the confirmation day. Specifically, the temperature and relative

humidity during 12±3 days before the confirmation day of the cases are collected. Then the
average temperature and relative humidity during the period are used in the regression
analysis. For example, in Argentina, the 80th case was confirmed on 19 March 2020 and the
160th case was confirmed on 22 March 2020. Thus, the average temperature and relative
humidity during 4 to 13 March in Argentina were calculated. Then, these data are used to
analyze the effect of meteorological factors on the epidemic doubling time measured as the
duration from the 80th to 160th confirmed cases.
Effect of meteorological factors on COVID-19 transmission in other countries
We first use the transmission rates in eleven provinces in mainland China as the dependent
variable in multiple regression. The intensity of local transmission and meteorological
conditions in different provinces vary largely. Moreover, inter-provincial travel is restricted
after the first-level public health emergency response, the highest state of emergency, is
activated. Therefore, we can estimate the transmission rate in each province separately. We
first extracted the key parameters of our SEIR model from the locally infected cases in each
province, including the number of onset cases per day, incubation period, percentage of
infected cases quarantined before the onset of symptoms, pre-symptomatic but infectious
time of the cases quarantined before the onset of symptoms, and onset-to-isolation time of the
cases not quarantined. Based on the extended SEIR model, the predicted onset case numbers
and transmission rates of the provinces are derived as shown in Figures S2–S12, Table S5
and Tables S7-8. Then, we collected daily values of temperature and relative humidity during
the simulation period for all the cities in the 11 provinces from World Weather Online24. The
regression results are shown in Table 1.
Then, we use the doubling time of confirmed cases from the 80th to 160th confirmed
cases in the countries outside China as the dependent variable in multiple regression. The
population of a country and health resources such as the number of hospital beds, number of

nurses, and number of physicians per 1,000 people are used as control variables. Logarithmic
transformation of the doubling time and the control variables was performed to normalize the
distribution of values. Temperature and relative humidity are the explanatory variables. We
define a dummy variable as 1 if the temperature is above 25

otherwise, 0. The

interaction between the dummy variable and relative humidity is introduced to check whether
the effect of humidity on disease transmission differs when the temperature becomes high.
Table 2 presents the results. We also performed linear regression analyses using the durations
from the 70th to 140th and 90th to 180th confirmed cases (Table S3–S4). Moreover, we used
the temperature and relative humidity during 12±2 days before the confirmation days of the
cases to further check the robustness of the findings. The results are qualitatively the same, as
shown in Table S9.
Infectious Period
For mainland China, the average infectious period of all patients with symptom onset before
20 January 2020 in the 11 provinces was used to indicate the infectious period before
implementing control measures. This is because human-to-human transmission of COVID-19
was confirmed on 20 January 2020, and few control measures were implemented before this
time. The first-level public health emergency response was activated on 24 or 25 January in
the 11 provinces. Afterwards, the strict control measures were implemented. Given the lag
between the time of implementing control measures and the time at which the measures take
effect, we used the average infectious period of all patients with symptom onset between 1
and 10 February 2020 to indicate the infectious period after implementing control measures.
Similarly, for Hong Kong and Singapore, local cases with symptom onset before 30 January
2020 and those between 5 and 29 February 2020 are used to estimate the infectious periods
before and after implementing control measures, respectively.
The infectious period is composed of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic infectious

periods. Through our simulation results, on average, the pre-symptomatic infectious is 2.70
days. If a patient is quarantined three days before the onset of symptoms, then the infectious
period is 0. For the patients quarantined one and two days before the onset of symptoms, the
infectious periods are 1.70 and 0.70 days, respectively. For cases who are not quarantined
before symptom onset, their infectious period is the sum of the pre-symptomatic infectious
period and the onset-to-isolation time.
