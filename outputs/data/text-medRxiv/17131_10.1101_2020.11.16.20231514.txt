ABSTRACT
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) as pandemic in March 2020. Currently there is no vaccine or specific effective
treatment for COVID-19. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is severe pneumonia leading to
respiratory failure. Radiation in low doses (<100 cGy) has been known for its anti-inflammatory
effect and therefore, low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) to lungs can potentially mitigate the
severity of pneumonia and reduce mortality. We conducted a pilot trial to study the feasibility and
clinical efficacy of LDRT to lungs in the management of patients with COVID-19.
Methods: From June to Aug 2020, we enrolled 10 patients with COVID-19 having moderate to
severe risk disease [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of ≥5]. Patients were treated as per
the standard COVID-19 management guidelines along with LDRT to both lungs with a dose of
70cGy in single fraction. Response assessment was done based on the clinical parameters using
the NEWS.
Results: All patients completed the prescribed treatment. Nine patients had complete clinical
recovery mostly within a period ranging from 3-7 days. One patient, who was a known
hypertensive, showed clinical deterioration and died 24 days after LDRT. No patients showed the
signs of acute radiation toxicity.
Conclusion: Results of our study (90% response rate) suggest the feasibility and clinical
effectiveness of LDRT in COVID-19 patients having moderate to severe risk disease. This
mandates a randomized controlled trial to establish the clinical efficacy of LDRT in COVID-19
pneumonia.

INTRODUCTION
Currently, there is a global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the WHO has declared COVID-19 as a
pandemic and as on 14th Novemebr 2020, there are a total of 52487476 confirmed cases and
1290653 deaths. (1) The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic to clinical
conditions characterized by respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and
intensive care unit (ICU) support. Severe pneumonia progressing to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) is the cause of death in majority of cases. The death rate ranges from 2-15%
in different group of patients. (2,3,4)
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug available for COVID-19. The treatment is
symptomatic, and oxygen therapy represents the major treatment intervention for patients with
severe infection. Based on severity of symptoms, there are several scoring methods which can
predict the outcome of disease. The NEWS is a popular scoring system used for non-ICU
patients suffering from acute illness. (5) This score helps in quickly determining the degree of
illness and intervention required. It also provides likelihood of death or admission to an ICU.
Based on this score, any illness can be categorized as mild (Score <4), moderate (Score 5-6 or
individual 3) and severe (Score ≥7). According to this scoring system, COVID-19 patients
having a score of 5-6 will have probability of 15.7% critical events (ICU admission or 30-day
mortality) and those having score≥7 will have about 24.1% critical events.(5)
The pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonitis appears to involve a cytokine storm with elevated
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFα among many others, leading to respiratory
failure. (6) Radiation therapy (RT) in low doses (<100 cGy) is known to have its antiinflammatory action by downregulating pro-inflammatory macrophages and upregulating antiinflammatory macrophages (interleukin-10, transforming growth factor β1) and natural killer
(NK) T cells thus countering the immune reaction incited by COVID-19. (7) Low dose lung
irradiation can potentially mitigate the severity of pneumonitis thereby reducing the risk of death.
It was a popular treatment of viral pneumonias until 1940s. (8) Historical data (9-13) suggests
that LDRT to whole lung can possibly prevent cytokine storm and ARDS. A few recent trials
(14, 15), though with small sample size and short-term results have shown encouraging results
with LDRT doses ranging from 0.5-1.5 Gy. We therefore conducted a pilot trial to study the
feasibility and clinical efficacy of LDRT to lungs in the management of patients with COVID19.

METHODS
This pilot study was conducted at our Institute to assess feasibility and clinical efficacy of LDRT
in patients with COVID-19. The study was initiated after approval by Institute Ethics committee
(Ref. No. IEC-465/22.05.2020, RP-01/2020). It is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT04394793) and Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2020/06/025862). The study protocol
was designed jointly by the radiation oncology team and Institute COVID Management Team
(comprising of members from departments of Internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, intensive
care, hospital infection control committee). The sample size of 10 patients was determined based

on multiple factors like incidence of COVID-19 disease, severity of disease, risk of viral exposure
to radiation oncology team, availability of radiation therapy resources, distance between the
COVID-19 indoor unit and radiation therapy machine etc. Eligible patients (as per inclusion
criteria) were enrolled in the study after obtaining their consent. In order to avoid viral exposure
to team, video conference facility was used while counseling them and taking their consent.
Complete details about the trial, steps involved, benefits or side effects of treatment were
explained to every patient.
Eligibility Criteria: Eligibility criteria included age more than 18 years, diagnosis of COVID-19
confirmed by RT-PCR and moderate to severe illness (NEWS ≥5). Generally, the febrile patients
who were already admitted to our indoor unit for COVID-19 management and having respiratory
rate of >24 per minute and or oxygen saturation of <94% were screened for inclusion as they were
likely to fulfill the eligibility criteria. Patients requiring mechanical ventilatory support or having
unstable hemodynamic status were excluded. As COVID-19 virus is highly contagious and poses a
risk to the various staff members during laboratory and radiological investigations, we adopted
NEWS for inclusion of patients as well as response assessment as this is mostly based on clinical
parameters (Table 1). We targeted patients having moderate to severe disease to assess the
efficacy of LDRT. The study outcome measures were: 1) number of ICU admissions or deaths; 2)
improvement in NEWS score post LDRT and 3) length of hospital stay post LDRT.
Treatment and workflow to RT machine: All patients were treated as per the Institute COVID19 standard management guidelines along with intervention of LDRT to both lungs with a dose of
70cGy in single fraction. The standard medical treatment generally consisted of oxygen
supplementation, antibiotics, dexamethasone and general supportive care. LDRT was delivered
employing 2 opposed antero-posterior and postero-anterior open portals. We did not use CT based
RT planning as the prescribed dose is very low and the expected dose to organs at risk (OAR) is
negligible. Additionally, CT simulation would increase the risk of viral exposure to staff. For
patient transport from indoor unit to RT machine (Varian True Beam Radiotherapy System Linear
Accelerator), the corridor was isolated. Patients were made to wear personal protective equipment
(PPE), or mask covering face and head before they were shifted to RT area. The patient was
positioned supine with hands above head. Machine gantry was rotated to 90 degree and a lateral
chest X-ray portal image was taken in order to guide in measuring dose prescription point. Gantry
was rotated back to 0 degree; an adequate field size was opened in order to cover both lungs. Upper
border of the field was kept above the superior edge of lateral end of clavicle extending 1 cm
superior to lung apex on portal imaging. Lower border extended below at the level of the L1
vertebrae (transpyloric plane) in order to cover costophrenic angle. Lateral borders were in the air
on both sides of chest. A dose of 70 cGy in single fraction was prescribed at the midpoint of
anterior-posterior chest separation using 6MV X-ray photons. Oxygen saturation level was
continuously monitored during the entire treatment by placing the pulse oximetry monitor facing
the CCTV camera. After completion of treatment, the patient was transported back to indoor unit
through the same corridor. The Linear Accelerator unit was sanitized as per the cleaning and
disinfection guidelines provided by the vendor.
Response Assessment: The response assessment was done mainly on clinical parameters as per
the NEWS. Imaging, routine hematological investigations and serum markers levels (like C-

reactive peptide, D-dimer, interleukin-6, ferritin etc.) were done as and when needed, but not
mandatorily for response assessment. The NEWS was recorded on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14.
These scores were compared with baseline score recorded on the day of LDRT i.e. on Day 0.
Clinical response was defined as subject achieving NEWS of 0 within 14 days following LDRT.
Failure was defined as ICU admission anytime after LDRT or death within 30 days. Patients were
generally discharged from the hospital after they attained NEWS of 0 along with negative test for
COVID-19. They were contacted on phone for any further required information.

RESULTS
A total of 10 patients were recruited and treated from June to Aug 2020. Table 2 shows various
clinical characteristics of the patients. All the patients were male with a median age of 51 years
(range 38 to 63 years). The shortness of breath was the commonest symptoms, found in all
patients. The median respiratory rate was 22 per minute (range 21-27 per minute). Majority of
patients (8 out of 10) had NEWS of 5-6. Three patients had co-morbidities (hypertension, 2 and
diabetes, 1).
LDRT was delivered after a mean of 3 days (range 1-9 days) of indoor admission (Table 3). Two
patients (patient no. 3 and 8) received LDRT after 6 and 9 days of hospitalization respectively as
they were having mild symptoms initially. All patients completed the prescribed LDRT. Average
time taken for LDRT (from entering to exiting treatment room) was 11 minutes (8-34 minutes).
One patient took unexpectedly longer time during treatment (34 minutes) due to technical
problem in switching on the machine. Another patient took 19 minutes since the radiation therapy
technologist had difficulty in starting the treatment due to fogging inside wall of face shield. No
patient required RT interruption due to deterioration of vitals or oxygen saturation.
Table 3 shows the progress in NEWS post LDRT. One patient, showed clinical deterioration and
had to be intubated. He finally succumbed of ARDS on day 24. Rest 9 patients had complete
clinical response and finally discharged from the hospital after their COVID test was negative.
The average hospital stay of the cured patients was 15 days (range 10-24 days). Fig. 1 depicts the
speed of clinical recovery. Most patients achieved a NEWS of 0 by Day-7. Day-30 clinical status
was determined by communicating the patients or relatives on phone. All 9 patients discharged
from hospital were alive. No patients showed the signs of acute radiation toxicity.

DISCUSSION
The results of our study have proven the feasibility of using LDRT for treatment of COVID-19
patients with moderate to severe risk disease. All patients completed the prescribed treatment
without any hurdles. None of the radiation therapy team members involved in LDRT of these
patients acquired COVID-19 infection. We used simple, open field technique for RT to minimize
the radiation planning and delivery time. No patient showed any signs of acute toxicity and
therefore it is clinically safe.
In terms of clinical improvement, we observed 90% clinical response rate in our study which This
suggests that LDRT is clinically efficacious in COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe illnes.

Only one patient, who had associated co-morbidity (HT) did not respond to LDRT and died of
ARDS. It is well known that the patients with co-morbidities have higher risk of mortality. The
other 2 patients in our series (patient no. 5 and 7) who had co-morbidities had good response and
recovered within a week and discharged in less than 2 weeks of LDRT. Overall results of our
study have been very encouraging and justifies the conduction of future randomized controlled
trial with larger sample size. Besides clinical efficacy, LDRT also helps in averting the need of
ICU admission. ICU care consumes lot of manpower resources and cost which are constrained in
developing countries like India having high incidence of COVID-19.
The initial report using X-rays to treat patients with pneumonia was in 1907 by Edsall and
Pemberton (9). Subsequent reports till 1940s suggested that LDRT was successful in decreasing
the mortality rate in untreated patients from about 30% to 5-10%. (10-13) In 1943, Oppenheimer
(13) reported the results of LDRT using 50 rontgen in 56 patients of viral pneumonia and
observed cure rate of 80%. During that time, there was no concept of lung correction factor and
therefore the actual dose delivered to lungs in Oppenheimer's study was more than 50 rontgen. He
further observed that if radiation was delivered in the first week of disease phase, the cure rate
was 100% as compared to 50% when delivered after 2 weeks. Despite good clinical results
reported in these trials (10-13), LDRT slowly vanished after the arrival of penicillin. Kirkby and
Mackenzie first suggested the use of LDRT in current COVID-19. (16)
Recently, two studies (14, 15), to the best of our knowledge, have been published reporting the
use of LDRT for COVID-19 and ours is the third one being reported here. Table 4 shows the
comparison of these two studies with our present study. Our study has the largest sample size (10
vs 5 vs 5 patients). Both trials (14, 15) had higher median age and co-morbidities as compared to
ours. LDRT dose was highest in the study by Hess at al. (15) Though it is difficult to compare
clinical outcome due to small sample sizes in all three studies (Table 4), the recovery rate was
relatively higher in our study (90% vs 80% vs 80%). This is probably because our patients had
relatively less severe disease and lower frequency of co-morbidities. We believe LDRT is most
effective in averting the cytokine storm and therefore may be used before the cytokine storm has
set in. Therefore our study was designed to enroll patients with moderate to severe illness.
Castillo et al. (17) have recently published a report of 64 year old patient treated with LDRT.
They adopted CT based planning prescribing a dose of 1.0 Gy with VMAT technique. Clinical
target volume (CTV) consisting of whole lung and (OAR) were contoured. A circumferential 5mm and craniocaudal 10-mm PTV expansion was created. Procedure duration consisted of 30
minutes planning and about 13 minutes of treatment delivery (including cone beam CT scan
performance). The patient showed improvement after 3 days of LDRT and shifted out of ICU
after 6 days. We do not encourage CT based planning considering negligible dose to OAR due to
low prescription dose.
Although it is hypothesized that LDRT potentially mitigate the COVID-19 pneumonitis by
inducing an anti-inflammatory effect; animal, human and in vitro studies indicate that LDRT may
have the potential to control bacterial pneumonia. (18) Therefore, LDRT may also be capable of
reducing bacterial co-infections in patients with COVID-19. Additionally, LDRT might prevent

accelerated viral drug-related mutation thus potentially improving the immune response by means
of the enhanced RNA damage compared to antiviral therapy. (18, 19)
Whenever RT is employed for benign conditions, concerns are expressed about risk of radiation
induced carcinogenesis. It is often ignored that even without radiation exposure; a healthy human
being does carry a certain amount of life-time risk of developing cancer. The excess absolute risk
(EAR) induced by radiation exposure is determined by the below formula proposed by Preston
(20) considering the β = 10, θ = − 0.05 and γ = 1.
ࢇࢍࢋ γ
ቁ
૞૙

EAR per 10000 personyears = βDe θ(agex − 25)ቀ

According to this formula, the increase in EAR is about 0.4% for 0.5 Gy and 1.2% for 1.5 Gy over
a 20 year period. The LDRT involves only thoracic organs as OAR rather than whole body
exposure thus further minimizing the risk. This EAR is negligible considering the potential benefit
of LDRT in the current pandemic.
Our study has several limitations including small sample size and response assessment without
radiological or laboratory investigations. We wanted to keep the study design simple and
convenient for smooth conduction considering the fear of radiation exposure amongst the patient
population and also the panic in radiation therapy team which is primarily a non-COVID team.
There are several ongoing trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04427566, NCT04572412,
NCT04377477, NCT04493294 and NCT04393948) with primary outcome assessment based on
clinical parameters. (21)
In conclusion, the results of our pilot study suggest that LDRT is feasible and clinically effective
in COVID-19 patients having moderate to severe disease. Based on the encouraging results of two
recently published trials (14, 15) and our study, it is justified to conduct large randomized
controlled trials to establish the clinical efficacy of LDRT to reduce the COVID-19 mortality.

Interpretation
• A low score (NEWS 1–4) should prompt assessment by a competent registered nurse who should
decide if a change to frequency of clinical monitoring or an escalation of clinical care is required.
• A medium score (i.e. NEWS of 5–6 or a RED score) should prompt an urgent review by a clinician
skilled with competencies in the assessment of acute illness – usually a ward-based doctor or acute
team nurse, who should consider whether escalation of care to a team with critical-care skills is
required (ie critical care outreach team).
o A RED score refers to an extreme variation in a single physiological parameter (i.e., a score
of 3 on the NEWS chart in any one physiological parameter, colored RED to aid
identification; e.g., heart rate

A high score (NEWS ≥7) should prompt emergency assessment by a clinical team/critical care
outreach team with critical-care competencies and usually transfer of the patient to a higher
dependency care area.
