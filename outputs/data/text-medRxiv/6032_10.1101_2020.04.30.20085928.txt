Abstract
Background: Cancer patients have been reported to be at higher risk of COVID-19 complications and
deaths. We report the characteristics and outcome of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during breast
cancer treatment at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH, Paris area, France).
th

Methods: An IRB-approved prospective registry was set up at ICH on March 13 , 2020 for all breast
cancer patients with COVID-19 symptoms or radiologic signs. Registered data included patient history,
tumor characteristics and treatments, COVID-19 symptoms, radiological features and outcome. Data
th

extraction was done on April 25 , 2020. COVID-19 patients were defined as those with either a positive
RNA test or typical, newly appeared lung CT-scan abnormalities.
Results: Among 15,600 patients actively treated for early or metastatic breast cancer during the last 4
months at ICH, 76 patients with suspected COVID-19 infection were included in the registry and followed.
Fifty-nine of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 based on viral RNA testing (N=41) or typical
radiologic signs: 37/59 (63%) COVID-19 patients were treated for metastatic breast cancer, and 13/59
(22%) of them were taking corticosteroids daily. Common clinical features mostly consisted of fever and/or
cough, while ground-glass opacities were the most common radiologic sign at diagnosis. We found no
association between prior radiation therapy fields or extent of radiation therapy sequelae and extent of
COVID-19 lung lesions. Twenty-eight of these 59 patients (47%) were hospitalized and 6 (10%) were
transferred to an intensive care unit. At the time of analysis, 45/59 (76%) patients were recovering or had
been cured, 10/59 (17%) were still followed and 4/59 (7%) had died from COVID-19. All 4 patients who
died had significant non-cancer comorbidities. In univariate analysis, hypertension and age (>70) were the
two factors associated with a higher risk of intensive care unit admission and/or death.
Conclusions: This prospective registry analysis suggests that the COVID-19 mortality rate in breast
cancer patients depends more on comorbidities than prior radiation therapy or current anti-cancer
treatment. Special attention must be paid to comorbidities when estimating the risk of severe COVID-19 in
breast cancer patients.

Background
st

On December 31 , 2019, the World Health Organization was informed about cases of pneumonia of
unknown cause in Wuhan, China [1]. A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [2].
Over the following months, the viral outbreak shifted from China to the rest of the world and was
subsequently recognized as a pandemic [3]. In France, the number of confirmed cases rose during early
March: more than 2,800 confirmed cases were officially reported on March 13, 2020, when the French
hospital emergency response plan, which coordinates all hospitals, was increased to its maximum
th

readiness level [4]. As of April 24, France is the 6 most severely affected country in the world (in terms of
absolute numbers), with more than 21,000 official COVID-19-related deaths [4, 5]. With about 6,000
deaths, the Paris area is one of the most severely affected regions in France [6].
th

The first report on COVID-19 outcome in cancer patients was published on February 14 [7]: in a series of
18 Chinese patients with a history of cancer and a diagnosis of COVID-19, 7 (39%) had to be treated in
the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or died. This seminal retrospective study prompted major concerns about
the risk of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. Further studies confirmed that, compared to the Chinese
general population, cancer patients are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death [7-10] .
Cancer patients with blood, lung or metastatic cancers were reported to have the highest frequency of
severe outcome [8, 10]. These retrospective reports, of limited size and restricted to patients hospitalized
in Chinese hospitals, may not be fully transposable to Western healthcare systems, as suggested by a
preliminary report on New Yorkers admitted to ICU [11].
Our study reports the COVID-19 features and outcomes experienced by inpatients and outpatients
actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie hospitals (ICH) in the Paris area, France.

Methods
Registry
The prospective COVID-19 registry was approved by the ICH institutional review board, which waived
documentation of informed consent due to its observational nature. Starting from March 13th, 2020, all
proven or suspected COVID-19 cases were prospectively registered. Declaration of all proven or
suspected cases was made mandatory by the ICH Director, and done by any doctor or nurse to a unique
email address, even if RNA test was not done or available. Emails were checked several times a day by a
team of 5 doctors; all declared patients were included in the registry on the same day (day 1) and
followed-up. The standardized follow-up included phone calls to patients which were scheduled at days 8,
14 and 28 and tracked in the central registry. Follow-up calls were initially given by doctors, later joined by
other ICH qualified healthcare workers (such as genetic counsellors, who received a training on COVID19) for patients that had mild symptoms or who were recovering. More frequent and/or longer follow-up
was provided whenever medically necessary. Patients hospitalized outside IC hospitals were also
registered and prospectively followed. The list of patients who had an RNA test prescribed at ICH was
also investigated (with no missing case identified). Data captured in the registry are displayed in
th

Supplementary Methods 1. For this analysis, data were extracted on April 25 , 2020. This report was
written according to the STROBE checklist.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. Testing was initially restricted to critically ill patients with COVID-19 symptoms,
but subsequently became available to all cancer patients (including outpatients that were under active
treatment) with suspected COVID-19 at the end of March 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 2 regions of the
viral RdRp gene. All assays used in France had to be validated by the French National Reference Center
(Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) [12, 13].
CT scan protocol and image interpretation. Whenever available, CT images were centrally reviewed by
two senior radiologists with consensus qualitative and semiquantitative assessment. In accordance with

previous reports on COVID-19 imaging [14, 15], the following patterns were sought: ground-glass opacity,
crazy paving (ground glass opacity associated with interlobular septal thickening [16]), focal consolidation
and linear consolidation. To be included in the COVID-19 population, patients with negative or not
available RNA test had to display typical and newly acquired (i.e. not pre-existing on the previous CTscan) COVID-19 related lung lesions. The predominant pattern was determined for each examination. The
severity (%) of lung involvement was evaluated according to the French Society of Radiology guidelines
[17]. The presence of lung or pleural metastases was assessed by comparison with previous CT scans.
Lung radiation therapy sequelae were evaluated by semiquantitative evaluation of confluent radiologic
opacities (grade 3 of the Lent-Soma scoring system [18]) affecting the right, left or middle lobes (no
involvement; ≤10% of lung volumes; 11-25%; ≥26%).
Statistics
The main study population, “COVID-19 patients”, is defined as those with positive RNA test or for whom
RT-PCR result was not available (or pending) but who had suggestive radiologic findings. We also report
data on the subgroup of patients who had biological confirmation of COVID-19 status using RT-PCR,
referred to as “RNA-positive subgroup”, but did not perform statistical analyses on that subgroup. Main
outcome of patients was defined as death or ICU admission. Descriptive and univariate prognostic factor
analysis was performed. Two sensitivity analyses were performed: (i) using death only and (ii) using time
to death or ICU admission to account for patients with partial follow-up. As sensitivity analyses, prognostic
factor analysis of death only. Due to the highly explorative nature of the report and the small number of
events, no adjustment for multiple testing was applied and multivariate analysis was not done. All
analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 and R software.

From March 13 , 2020 to April 25 , 2020 (date of data extraction), 76 patients actively treated for breast
cancer were included in the ICH COVID-19 registry. For comparison, 15,600 breast cancer patients had at
least one consultation or treatment for breast cancer at one of the IC hospitals in the 4 months before
lockdown (11/01/2019 to 02/28/2020). The patient flow-chart for the COVID-19 registry is displayed in

Figure 1A. RNA testing was performed in 58 patients, while CT scan was performed in 39 patients. A total
of 59 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on either a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test (N=41
patients; “RNA-positive subgroup”) or, in the case of negative or missing RNA test, radiologic findings
(N=18 patients). Seventeen patients only reported symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 that were not
confirmed by RNA test and/or lung CT scan. Most patients in the subgroup who underwent both RNA
testing and CT scan presented concordant results, as displayed in Figure 1B.
Patient history
Breast cancer patient history and comorbidities are shown in Table 1. Ten of the 59 COVID-19 patients
(17%) were older than 70. Other notable comorbidities among COVID-19 patients included hypertension
(36%), obesity (17%), diabetes (17%) and heart disease (14%). The most frequent comedication in this
population was corticosteroids (22%, defined as a daily intake of more than 20 mg-equivalent dose of
prednisolone, excluding chemotherapy comedications). Reasons for corticosteroid intake were
symptomatic brain or leptomeningeal metastasis (10%), epiduritis (5%), other cancer-related symptoms
(5%) and autoimmune hepatitis (2%), respectfully. All these patients have been under corticosteroids for
at least one month. About two-thirds of COVID-19 patients (and all those treated with corticosteroids) were
treated for metastatic breast cancer. As shown in Table 2, ongoing anti-cancer treatments were
representative of those currently administered to patients treated for early or metastatic disease, most
commonly chemotherapy (49%), followed by endocrine therapy (32%).
Features at diagnosis
Clinical, laboratory and radiologic features at diagnosis are displayed in Table 3. Fever and cough were
the most common symptoms, observed in 46% and 37% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Nine of the
59 patients (18%) developed COVID-19 symptoms more than 2 days after being admitted to hospital (IC
or elsewhere), corresponding to the interval used to define nosocomial infections. The mean absolute
3

lymphocyte count was normal (1.5/mm ). Most patients had no or limited extent of COVID-19 lung
disease, as 25/28 patients (89%) had less than 25% involvement of their lung volume. Twenty-eight CTscan were available for central review: the most common radiologic feature was ground-glass opacities,
observed in 14/28 (50%) of COVID-19 patients with CT scan at diagnosis. No significant association was
observed between these characteristics or the presence of lung metastases and the extent of COVID-19

lung disease. Supplementary Figure 1 displays, for each COVID-19 patient, the prior radiation therapy
fields, radiation therapy sequelae and extent of COVID-19 lung disease. There was no association
between prior radiation therapy and the extent of COVID-19 lesions (≤10% vs >10%, Fisher exact test
p=0.69).
Outcome and prognostic factors
All patient outcomes were updated 2 days prior to this analysis. Of the 59 breast cancer patients
diagnosed with COVID-19, 28 (47%) were hospitalized, while 31 (53%) returned home. Twenty-three
(82%) of the 28 hospitalized patients received antibiotics and 3 (11%) received corticosteroids. No
patients received hydroxychloroquine, antiviral or immunomodulating drugs as frontline treatment at
admission. The use of these putative treatments, which were available whenever necessary throughout
the patient’s stay in hospital and was not always available for patients hospitalized outside ICH.
None of the 17 symptom-only patients had to be hospitalized. The flow of COVID-19 patients during the
course disease is shown in Figure 2. Four patients were transferred to ICU at diagnosis or during
th

hospitalization. As of April 24 , 45 (76%) of the 59 COVID-19 patients were considered to be either
recovering or cured. The outcome of 10 (17%) patients remains undetermined (most recent cases with
limited follow-up), while 4 (6.7%) patients died: 2 patients were receiving later lines of treatment for
metastatic breast cancer (these patients were not transferred to ICU), 1 patient had recently started firstline endocrine therapy combined with palbociclib and 1 patient was receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Noteworthy, this last patient was treated with an anti-CD80/86 antibody (regulating CTLA-4 signaling).
Further details on the history of the four deceased patients are available in Table 4.
An exploratory analysis of factors associated with either ICU admission and/or death in the COVID-19
population showed that, among all factors listed in Tables 1-3, only age > 70 years and hypertension were
significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (both p<0.05). More specifically, the ongoing systemic
treatment type (Supplementary Table 1), lymphopenia (<0.5G/L), neutropenia (<1G/L) and use of
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers had no significant prognostic
impact (all p value >0.6). Age and hypertension remained as prognostic factors in the subgroup of RNA
test-positive patients except that hypertension was of borderline significance. Same statistical conclusions
were obtained with the analyses of time to death or ICU admission.

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is the first viral pandemic affecting cancer patients and oncology teams. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on COVID-19 diagnosis, signs and outcome in breast
cancer patients.
While 15,600 patients were actively treated for breast cancer at Institut Curie Hospitals over the 4 months
prior to the pandemic, only 59 were diagnosed with COVID-19 by either RNA test or CT scan. A recent
study estimated that more than 10% of inhabitants of the greater Paris area have been infected by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus [19]. While our study cannot determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection among
breast cancer patients, the small number of diagnosed cases suggests that breast cancer patients do not
appear to be at higher risk than the general population. This apparent low incidence could possibly be
attributed to much stricter application of social distancing procedures by cancer patients, who had been
informed that they may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Prophylactic changes implemented
in breast cancer care (e.g., postponement of all non-mandatory visits to ICH, changes in medical
treatments, etc.) may also have contributed to further reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A limitation
of our study is that some patients may have been treated by their family physicians or referred to local
hospitals, without any notification to ICH. Although no data was available to compare COVID-19 patients
to the other breast cancer patients seen at ICH, rates of high BMI and hypertension in our COVID-19
patient cohort were very similar to those reported in a recent prospective large-scale report on French
breast cancer patients [20], suggesting that these comorbidities do not increase the risk of COVID-19. Our
analyses showed that breast cancer patients have similar clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 to
those previously described in other reports on non-cancer COVID-19 patients. Importantly, we found no
trend in favor of a relationship between a history of breast and lymph node radiation therapy, radiation
therapy sequela and radiologic extent of disease or outcome. Thrombotic, cardiovascular, microvascular
and dermatological events were not recorded, as their association with COVID-19 was not fully recognized
when the registry was set up.
In terms of COVID-19 outcome, we observed a non-negligible mortality rate of 6.7% (4/59) among breast
cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with a higher mortality rate of 9.7% (4/41) in the RNA-positive

th

subgroup. As of April 26 , the reported mortality rate among RNA-positive patients in the general
population ranges from 18.2% in France to 5.6% in the USA and 3.7% in Germany [4]. However, these
percentages reflect more testing policy more than true differences in mortality rates. As in the general
population, the true infection and mortality rates could subsequently be determined by serology tests
detecting an immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, on univariate analysis, age and
hypertension were associated with disease severity rather than the extent of disease or ongoing cancer
therapy. More specifically, we found no statistical relationship between ongoing chemotherapy and
outcome. Overall, our data suggest that breast cancer patients share the same risk factors for severe
COVID-19 as the general population. Strikingly, the only early breast cancer patient who died was
concomitantly treated for a systemic disease by a CTLA-4 signalling modulator, suggesting that breast
cancer per se is not a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality. Limitations of this analysis include the
limited number of patients, a potential under-declaration due to the difficulty in identifying COVID-19 cases
in outpatients who may have been referred to other hospitals. A longer follow-up of this registry may help
defining more precisely the outcome of breast cancer patients with COVID-19.

Conclusions
While lockdown lifting procedures are being discussed in most Western countries, this first report on
breast cancer patients suggests that comorbidities (apart from breast cancer) should be the primary focus
of attention to define patients at high risk. Further studies devoted to breast cancer patients will help to
define breast cancer care for the following months, until preventive treatments, such as a vaccine, have
been found.

Table 4: Description of COVID-19-related deaths.

Patient #1 was a 69-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and rheumatoid arthritis treated by abatacept (a CTLA-4 immunoglobulin). She was
diagnosed with stage IIB triple-negative breast cancer in February 2020 and started neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) in March. Three days after the first cycle, she was
referred to the emergency room (ER) with chest pain, fever and lung infection (day 1). SARS-CoV-2
infection was diagnosed based on positive RNA PCR and chest CT scan. She was admitted to ICU
for acute respiratory distress on day 7, treated with antibiotics, antiviral therapy (chloroquine and
lopinavir/ritonavir) and endotracheal intubation and ventilation. She died 19 days later (day 26).

Patient #2 was a 44-year-old patient with no relevant medical history, diagnosed with de novo stage
IV hormone-sensitive breast cancer (node, bone and hepatic metastases, with 4N cytolysis) in
February 2020. She received a first-line combination of CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor and
complete ovarian function suppression. On day 17 of her first month of treatment, she was referred
to the ER for asthenia, dyspnea, grade IV thrombocytopenia (14G/L) and grade IV neutropenia
(0.2G/L). She was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 lung infection complicated by thrombotic
microangiopathy, based on positive RNA test, chest CT scan and laboratory data. She was treated
symptomatically, including antibiotics, and was not transferred to ICU due to her metastatic disease
and major multiple organ failure. She died 8 days after ER admission.

Patient #3 was a 78-year-old woman with a history of hypertension. She had been treated since
November 2013 for stage IV hormone-sensitive breast cancer (lung and bone metastases). In March
2020, she received two cycles of weekly paclitaxel as second-line chemotherapy. Five days after the
last injection, she was referred to the ER with dyspnea and hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was
diagnosed based on a typical chest CT scan with extensive consolidation involving approximately
50% of the lungs. PCR RNA test was negative. Hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics were rapidly
initiated on day 1, but the patient was not transferred to ICU due to her limited oncological life
expectancy. She died on day 4.
Patient #4 was a 80-year-old woman treated for metastatic hormone-sensitive breast cancer (bone
metastasis only) since February 2016. Since January 2020, after tumor progression, systemic
therapies were stopped in favor of best supportive care. She had been hospitalized for tumor-related
symptoms since February 2020. In late March, she presented signs of lung infection, followed by
acute respiratory distress. Nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed based on positive
RNA PCR and chest CT scan with ground-glass opacities involving approximately 20% of the lungs.
Palliative symptomatic treatments with nasal oxygen therapy were initiated and the patient died 12
days after onset of the first symptoms.

Supplementary Methods 2
Patient flow. Starting on March 9, 2020, ICH provided information about COVID-19 symptoms and
guidelines to patients by means of regular e-mail and text messages. Follow-up consultations were
postponed. Consultations not requiring physical examination or detailed explanations were replaced by
teleconsultations. Patients were systematically subjected to COVID-19 symptom screening and body
temperature checks at the hospital entrances. Those with COVID-19 symptoms were directed to specific
emergency room areas and were tested. When necessary, patients with suspected or proven COVID-19
were hospitalized in specific wards or transferred to internal or external ICU. Of note, Paris and its area
did not run out of standard inpatients or ICU beds.
Surgery. The French hospital emergency response plan (“plan blanc”) required postponement of all nonurgent surgery. ICH surgeons complied with the national guidelines for breast cancer patients issued by
learned societies [1], included postponement of surgery for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19, in
whom an alternate treatment option was available (eg, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy was proposed in
elderly ER+ breast cancer patients). Patients were systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(nasopharyngeal swabs) in the two days prior to general anesthesia, even in the absence of symptoms.
Medical oncology. Internal guidelines were applied at ICH starting from March 9, in line with national
guidelines for breast cancer patients [1]: ongoing chemotherapy was not discontinued. Neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was avoided in patients with smaller tumors (< 3 cm), even including triple-negative and
HER2-positive subtypes. Adjuvant chemotherapy indications were mostly maintained, but situations
associated with a marginal survival benefit had to be discussed with the patients. Dose-dense
anthracycline regimens were discouraged. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis was
systematically used for anthracycline-based regimens and docetaxel, with the docetaxel dose reduced to
2

75 mg/m . In patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (proven or unproven), the next chemotherapy
cycle was delayed until 14 days after the first day of symptoms, pending the clearance of hyperthermia
and dyspnea. Endocrine therapy indications and doses were not modified. Targeted therapy (including
CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors) indications and doses were not modified, except for alpelisib and
everolimus. Initiation of a new line of therapy with alpelisib was discouraged, but ongoing treatment was
maintained. Everolimus was discontinued in all patients, except for a handful of patients with prolonged

objective response. Atezolizumab indications and doses were not modified, but close monitoring of these
patients was recommended. When used as comedication for chemotherapy, corticosteroid doses were
systematically reduced by one-half and were discontinued whenever possible.
Radiation therapy. Indications and ongoing treatments were not modified, but adjuvant radiotherapy was
hypofractionated whenever possible [1, 2].
Palliative care. For patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer and/or severe pre-existing
comorbidities, a dedicated COVID-19 videoconference multidisciplinary meeting was held daily to discuss
the medical and ethical relevance of antiviral treatments and transfer to ICU. Palliative care for breast
cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted according to the guidelines issued by the
French society of palliative care [3].
