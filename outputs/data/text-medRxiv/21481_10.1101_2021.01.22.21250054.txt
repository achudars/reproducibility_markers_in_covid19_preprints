HIGHLIGHTS

•

Dysfunctional spike-specific T cells are characteristic of severe COVID-19

•

Spike-specific CD127+ Th1 cells are increased in survivors of severe COVID-19

•

Spike-specific Tregs and IL6+ CD8+ T cells are increased in fatal COVID-19

•

Escalation of activated lung-homing CXCR4+ T cells associates with fatal COVID-19

BRIEF SUMMARY
By conducting CyTOF on total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from longitudinal specimens
spanning the entire spectrum of COVID-19 diseases, Neidleman et al. demonstrate that spikespecific Th1 cells capable of IL7-dependent homeostatic proliferation predict survival from
severe COVID-19, while Tregs and IL6+ CD8+ T cells recognizing spike predict fatal outcome.
Fatal COVID-19 is characterized by escalating activation of bystander CXCR4+ T cells in the
lungs. Boosting SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T effector responses while diminishing CXCR4mediated homing may help recovery from severe disease.

SUMMARY
Although T cells are likely players in SARS-CoV-2 immunity, little is known about the
phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associated with recovery from severe
COVID-19. We analyzed T cells from longitudinal specimens of 34 COVID-19 patients with
severities ranging from mild (outpatient) to critical culminating in death. Relative to patients that
succumbed, individuals that recovered from severe COVID-19 harbored elevated and
increasing numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells capable of homeostatic proliferation. In
contrast, fatal COVID-19 displayed elevated numbers of SARS-CoV-2-specific regulatory T cells
and a time-dependent escalation in activated bystander CXCR4+ T cells. Together with the
demonstration of increased proportions of inflammatory CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs of severe
COVID-19 patients, these results support a model whereby lung-homing T cells activated
through bystander effects contribute to immunopathology, while a robust, non-suppressive
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response limits pathogenesis and promotes recovery from severe
COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has taken an
unprecedented toll on the world’s healthcare systems and economy, and a year since its
emergence has already claimed over 2 million lives with fatality rates reaching as high as 20%
in some countries (Sorci et al., 2020). While most infected individuals are asymptomatic or
mildly symptomatic, up to ~20% require hospitalization, and this rate increases dramatically in
the elderly (>65 years) and those with underlying health conditions (Docherty et al., 2020;
Grasselli et al., 2020). Evidence to date suggests variability in host response, rather than viral
genetics, to be the prime driver behind the wide range of disease manifestation. For example,
individuals genetically pre-disposed to low type I IFN activity, due to inborn loss-of-function
genetic variants or autoantibodies against these innate immune cytokines, have increased risk
of severe disease (Bastard et al., 2020; van der Made et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
The adaptive immune system, consisting of cellular (T cell) and humoral (B cell)
immunity, is also important in the host’s defense against SARS-CoV-2. While a coordinated
response between the cellular and humoral arms seems to be important in effective control
(Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020), T cells appear able to resolve infection when B cell
responses are insufficient. Indeed, the recovery of two individuals with X-linked
agammaglobulinemia without the need for oxygen supplementation or intensive care suggests
that antibodies are not absolutely required for clearing SARS-CoV-2 (Soresina et al., 2020). In
fact, high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are associated with more severe disease
(Garcia-Beltran et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Woodruff et al., 2020), suggesting that high
antibody levels may not always be effective. A consistent hallmark of severe COVID-19 is T cell
lymphopenia (Chen et al., 2020a; Zhao et al., 2020a), which is unlikely to simply reflect T cell
sequestration in the infected lungs (Liao et al., 2020). Importantly, while overall T cell
lymphopenia is observed, the frequencies of some T cell subsets positively associate with
disease severity. For example, activated T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been

reported to be elevated in severe cases (De Biasi et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020). It is
however unclear whether these T cells are specific or not to SARS-CoV-2.
Indeed, while many studies have profiled total T cells across the entire spectrum of
COVID-19 severity, few studies have analyzed the features of T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2
epitopes. As these antigen-specific cells are the ones that can directly recognize virally-infected
cells and aid in the generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, they have the most potential
to exert a beneficial effect on recovery from disease and are the T cell targets of vaccination.
We recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from convalescent individuals that
had recovered from mild disease produced IFNg, but not IL4, IL6, or IL17 (Neidleman et al.,
2020a). The undetected cytokines, particularly IL6, have been implicated in COVID-19associated pathogenesis (Del Valle et al., 2020; Hotez et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Mathew
et al., 2020; Pacha et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), although whether SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cells secrete these cytokines during severe disease, and, if so, whether this contributes to
pathogenesis, are not clear. In fact, the fundamental question of whether SARS-CoV-2-specific
T cells are beneficial or detrimental during acute infection is debated. A recent study found that
a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, but not a strong antibody response, negatively
associates with disease severity (Mathew et al., 2020), while another research group reported a
pathogenic role for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (Anft et al., 2020; Thieme et al., 2020).
Differences in experimental design may account for these discrepant results, but, importantly,
these prior studies did not compare fatal to non-fatal COVID-19 cases. Most studies to date
have compared immune features associated with moderate versus severe COVID-19 cases,
and to our knowledge no studies have compared the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cells in severe cases of COVID-19 that ultimately recover from or succumb to disease.
Here, we define the features T cells from individuals hospitalized in the ICU for COVID19, including some that recovered and some that died from disease. We implemented deepphenotyping of both total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using 38-parameter CyTOF, a

technique we recently applied to characterize T cells from convalescent individuals (Neidleman
et al., 2020a). By conducting longitudinal assessments on 34 COVID-19 patients with disease
manifestations ranging from mild to fatal, we identified unique phenotypic features of SARSCoV-2-specific and bystander T cells associated with recovery from severe disease, and paired
this analysis with a detailed examination of the features of T cells in the lungs of COVID-19
patients.

RESULTS
Patient cohorts and experimental design
The demographics and clinical features of the COVID-19 patient cohort are presented in Table
S1. We analyzed a total of 48 blood specimens from 34 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, along
with samples from 11 uninfected controls. Of the 48 specimens, 33 were from individuals
hospitalized in the ICU (“severe”) and 6 from patients hospitalized but not in the ICU
(“moderate”). The last 9 came from patients who were never hospitalized (“mild”). An additional
11 SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals hospitalized in the ICU were phenotyped by CyTOF. In
total, 59 specimens were analyzed for total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. All specimens
were analyzed fresh, on the day of the blood draw, to avoid potential confounders associated
with cell cryopreservation. Immediately following PBMC isolation, a portion of the cells was fixed
for CyTOF, while remaining cells were stimulated with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2
spike to enable detection of induced cytokines. The unstimulated (“baseline”) and peptidestimulated specimens were analyzed simultaneously using the CyTOF panel presented in Table
S2. This panel was designed to include multiple markers of T cell differentiation state, activation
status, exhaustion, proliferative potential, and homing properties.

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are elicited during mild, moderate, and
severe COVID-19

Manual gating was used to identify CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the 59 specimens
analyzed by CyTOF. Because activation markers but not IFNg were expressed in the baseline
specimens (Fig. S1A, Fig. 1A), we used IFNg to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in the
stimulated samples, similar to our recent study (Neidleman et al., 2020a). While cells producing
high levels of IFNg were readily identified following peptide stimulation (Fig. 1A), cells producing
high levels of cytokines IL4, IL6, or IL17 were not observed (Fig. S1B, C). IFNg+ cells were
detected in the stimulated samples from all three patient groups and amounted to a total of
3,735 cells. Their frequencies ranged from undetectable to almost 2% of the patients’ T cells,
and were not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 1B). In comparison, total (nonantigen-specific) CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequencies from the baseline specimens were
significantly diminished in the moderate and severe groups (Fig. 1C), consistent with the
lymphopenia previously reported in hospitalized, acutely infected individuals (Chen et al.,
2020a; Zhao et al., 2020a).
As cross-reactive T cell responses have been reported in some individuals never
exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020), we
assessed to what extent the responses we detected in COVID-19 patients were generated de
novo. We acquired 11 fresh blood specimens from individuals hospitalized in the ICU for
reasons unrelated to COVID-19 and confirmed by RT-PCR to not be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were significantly more frequent in the infected ICU patients
than the uninfected ICU patients (Fig. 1D), confirming de novo production of SARS-CoV-2specific CD4+ T cells by severe COVID-19 patients. Although we did see evidence of low levels
of cross-reactive responses, even in the uninfected individual with the strongest response to
peptide stimulation, SARS-CoV-2-specific cells only accounted for 0.01% of the CD4+ T cells
(Fig. 1D, inset). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing spike were also detected at
higher frequencies in the infected relative to uninfected individuals. However, due to their low

frequencies relative to CD4+ T cells (consistent with prior observations (Ferretti et al., 2020;
Neidleman et al., 2020a)), this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1D). Together, these
data suggest that despite lymphopenia, de novo T cell responses are mounted against SARSCoV-2 in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

Phenotypes of total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells differ in mild, moderate, and severe
COVID-19
As an initial examination of the phenotypes of the T cells in infected patients, we
calculated the mean signal intensity (MSI) of each antigen (Fig. S2, Fig. S3), and compared
them between the 3 patient groups for the following cell populations: Baseline, Bystander, and
SARS-CoV-2-specific. Among baseline samples, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from severe cases
expressed significantly higher levels of activation markers HLADR, CD69, CD25, and PD1, as
well as chemokine receptor CXCR4, which directs cells to inflamed and damaged lung tissues
(Mamazhakypov et al., 2019), relative to mild cases. Among SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells,
antigens significantly upregulated in severe relative to mild cases included the
activation/exhaustion markers PD1 and TIGIT.
We next assessed the subset distribution of total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using
manual gating. CD45RO expression is commonly used to define memory T cells, and CD45RA
to define naïve T cells (Tn), although CD45RA is also expressed on terminally differentiated
effector memory (Temra) and stem cell memory (Tscm) T cells. We found that for both CD4+
and CD8+ T cells, CD45RO+CD45RA- frequencies were highest in the severe group while
CD45RO-CD45RA+ were the lowest (Fig. 2A, B). This was observed for both total and SARSCoV-2-specific T cells, and is consistent with the severe group expressing overall higher levels
of CD45RO and lower levels of CD45RA (Fig. S2, S3). Gating within the CD45RO+CD45RAand CD45RO-CD45RA+ populations allowed us to identify the proportions of central memory
(Tcm), effector memory (Tem), transitional memory (Ttm), Tn, Temra, and Tscm subsets (Fig.

2A, B). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were enriched for Tem cells and relatively depleted
of Temra cells. Changes in subset distribution were also observed among total T cells. For
example, the severe group harbored significantly higher proportions of CD8+ Tem and CD4+
Tscm, and lower proportions of CD8+ Ttm.
We then examined the percentages of CD4+ Tregs and circulating T follicular helper
(cTfh) cells, subsets important in immunoregulation and helping antibody responses,
respectively. The frequencies of Tregs were similar between the three patient groups, although
there was a trend for higher levels in the severe group. By contrast, the moderate and severe
groups had significantly higher frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific cTfh than the mild group
did (Fig. 2C), suggesting potential elicitation of antibody production through T-cell help during
moderate/severe acute infection. Additional manual gating revealed PD1+CD95+ T cells, within
both the total and SARS-CoV-2-specific compartments, to be most abundant during severe
infection (Fig. 2D). Total and SARS-CoV-2-specific PD1+TIGIT+ T cells were also more
frequent during severe infection, but only within the CD8 compartment (Fig. 2E). These findings
are consistent with the increased expression of PD1, CD95, and TIGIT in severe cases (Fig. S2,
S3). As co-expression of PD1 and CD95 is characteristic of apoptosis-prone cells while coexpression of PD1 and TIGIT is characteristic of exhausted cells, these findings together
suggest an increased T cell dysfunction during severe COVID-19.

Clustering reveals an accumulation in activation and exhaustion markers in T cells from
severe COVID-19 patients
Having analyzed cellular subsets through manual gating, we then implemented a more
holistic approach integrating all the CyTOF phenotyping markers in our panel to identify
populations of cells associated with disease severity. Clustering by FlowSOM (Van Gassen et
al., 2015) revealed differences between mild, moderate, and severe infection in both total and
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, and among both the CD4+ (Fig. 3A-D) and CD8+ (Fig. 4A-D)

compartments. Among total CD4+ T cells, the most noticeable difference was a single cluster
(B4.9), composed of activated memory CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of the homing
receptor CCR6 (Ito et al., 2011), which was present at higher frequencies in the severe group.
However, this difference became insignificant after correction for multiple testing (Fig. 3E). In
comparison, total CD8+ T cells revealed four clusters that were significantly enriched in the
severe group (Fig. 4E). These clusters all expressed elevated levels of HLADR, but only some
expressed CD38 (Fig. 4F), suggesting that HLADR may be a more universal marker of SARSCoV-2-induced global T cell activation than CD38. One cluster (B8.1) was enriched in the mild
group (Fig. 4E), albeit insignificantly after adjustment for multiple correction, and this cluster
expressed low levels of both HLADR and CD38 (Fig. 4F).
Examination of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell clusters revealed one CD4+ and one CD8+
T cell cluster enriched in the severe group, and one CD4+ T cell cluster enriched in the mild
group (Fig. 3G, 4G). The two clusters enriched in the severe group shared phenotypic features,
including increased expression levels of the activation markers HLADR and CD38 and
exhaustion markers PD1 and CTLA4, and decreased expression of the IL7 receptor alpha chain
CD127 (Fig. 3H, 4H). These markers were not differentially expressed among the CD4+ cluster
enriched in the mild group (Fig. 3H). To determine whether a subset of the markers identified by
FlowSOM are sufficient to enrich for cells from the severe group, we manually gated on cells
expressing the two activation/exhaustion markers PD1 and CTLA4. PD1+CTLA4+ cells were
more frequent in the severe groups among both SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 3I, 4I). These findings, together with the earlier observations based solely on manual
gating, point to an overabundance of exhausted T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike during
severe COVID-19.

Recovery from severe COVID-19 associates with enhanced SARS-CoV-2-specific effector
T cell response

Of our specimens analyzed by CyTOF, 33 were from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals
in the ICU, 32% of whom subsequently died from COVID-19. We next focused on these
specimens to try to identify T cell signatures associated with survival from severe disease. Age
did not account for the differential survival outcomes, as the ages of survivors and non-survivors
were not significantly different (p = 0.8131) and the magnitude of the T cell response did not
associate with age (R2 = 0.0032 among severe patients). Although male sex is a risk factor for
severe COVID-19, we in fact found among our ICU patients a lower proportion of male patients
that died (22%, compared to 40% for females). Furthermore, we found similar frequencies of
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells among our hospitalized male and female patients, and no marked
phenotypic differences although there was a trend for higher activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific
T cells in females (Fig. S4), consistent with previous reports of total HLADR+CD38+ T cells
being higher in female COVID-19 patients (Takahashi et al., 2020). Because prior studies found
high levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to be associated with more severe disease (GarciaBeltran et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Woodruff et al., 2020), we assessed whether IgG and IgM
against the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid were enriched in non-survivors. We did not
find this to be the case, although we observed moderate/severe cases to harbor higher levels of
antibodies than mild cases (Fig. S5).
We then examined whether the T cells from survivors and non-survivors differed in their
response to spike peptide stimulation. Non-survivors more frequently failed to mount a robust
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, particularly for CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5A). The SARS-CoV-2specific CD8+ T cell response trended higher in the survivors, but this did not reach statistical
significance because of lower overall responses. Patients that mounted detectable SARS-CoV2-specific T cell responses harbored significantly lower frequencies of total HLADR+CD69+
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. S6), suggesting that an overall heightened state of T cell
activation may hinder the development of T responses directed specifically against SARS-CoV2.

Interestingly, two individuals mounted very robust CD8+ T cell responses to spike
peptides, and one of these survived while the other did not (highlighted in blue and red,
respectively, in Fig. 5A). After comparing all the antigens on these two patients’ CD8+ T cells,
we found that IL6 levels within the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were lower in the survivor
than in the non-survivor, and this phenomenon was not observed among total CD8+ T cells
(Fig. 5B). Of note, the subtleness of the increase in IL6 in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells
from the non-survivor was not due to weak antibody staining, as a positive control of LPSstimulated monocytes led to robust detection of IL6 (Fig. S7). This observation prompted us to
examine IL6 expression among all the ICU individuals that did elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+
T cell responses. Indeed, we found a highly significant increase in IL6-producing SARS-CoV-2specific CD8+ T cells in non-survivors, but not among total CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5B). These results
suggest the possibility that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells producing both IFNg and IL6
may contribute to lethal immunopathogenesis, although follow-up studies will be needed to
confirm this hypothesis.
We next assessed whether the major T cell subsets were differentially distributed among
the survivors and non-survivors. Memory CD4+ T cells were statistically more frequent in the
survivors, but no statistically significant differences were observed among the Tcm, Tem, Ttm,
Tn, Temra, or Tscm subsets (Fig. S8). Interestingly, however, SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs were
significantly more frequent among non-survivors, though total Tregs were not (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, Tfh frequencies were equivalent between survivors and non-survivors (Fig. 5C).
Together, these observations are consistent with a model whereby Tregs recognizing SARSCoV-2 spike can hinder the elicitation of a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, and
thus prevent recovery from severe disease.

Clustering reveals more activated, long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in
survivors of severe COVID-19

To compare T cells from survivors and non-survivors in an unbiased fashion, we
subjected them to clustering via FlowSOM, and found phenotypic differences between the two
groups for both CD4+ (Fig. 6A, B) and CD8+ (Fig. S9A, B) T cells. Among total CD4+ T cells,
two clusters (B4.1 and B4.9) were enriched in the survivor group, although the former did not
meet statistical significance (Fig. 6C). Both clusters consisted of activated (HLADR+) memory
(CD45RO+) cells. While B4.1 expressed the additional activation markers CD38, CD69, and
CCR5, B4.9 did not, consistent with earlier observations of HLADR being a more universal
marker of T cell activation. Similar analyses among total CD8+ T cells revealed cluster B8.6 to
be more frequent among survivors, albeit insignificantly after multiple correction (Fig. S9C). This
cluster also harbored activated cells, and were predominantly Tem cells as suggested by low
expression of CCR7 and CD62L. Interestingly, of all the CD8+ T cell clusters, this one harbored
the highest levels of HLADR (Fig. S9D). These results support the concept that global CD4+
and CD8+ T cell activation, as assessed by canonical activation markers such as HLADR, is not
detrimental but in fact, at least in our cohort, associated with survival from severe COVID-19.
This was further supported by our observation that activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells identified
by manual gating were significantly higher in the survivor than the non-survivor groups (Fig. 6D,
S9E).
We then assessed the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among the CD4+ T cells, S4.5 was
increased in non-survivors, while S4.9 was increased in the survivors. While S4.5 exhibited
features of exhausted T cells (expressing high levels of PD1 and CTLA4), S4.9 exhibited
features of cTfh cells with high proliferative potential (expressing high levels of CXCR5 and
CD127) (Fig. 6E). Manual gating confirmed a significant increase in CD127-expressing SARSCoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in patients that survived severe disease (Fig. 6F). As cluster S4.9
also expressed high levels of activation marker CD69 (Fig. 6E), we assessed whether activated
CD127+ cells were increased in survivors, and found this to indeed be the case (Fig. 6G).
Further analysis of cluster S4.9 confirmed it to be highly activated (expressing activation

markers HLADR, CD38, CCR5, and Ox40 in addition to CD69), exhibit features of Tcm
(expressing high levels of CCR7 and CD62L), and have mucosal tissue-homing potential
(expressing high levels of CCR6 and CD49d) (Fig. S10). By contrast, cluster S4.5 did not harbor
most of these features (Fig. S10). A cluster of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells significantly
enriched in survivors was also identified (S8.2), and this cluster harbored phenotypic features
distinct from the cluster of survivor-associated SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells (Fig. S9F).
S8.2 was not activated (expressing low levels of HLADR and CD38) and, unlike S4.9,
expressed low levels of CD127. Accordingly, unlike what was observed among SARS-CoV-2specific CD4+ T cells, the percentages of CD127-expressing cells among SARS-CoV-2-specific
CD8+ T cells were not increased among survivors (Fig. S9G). This suggests that relative to their
CD4+ counterparts, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells in survivors may be less long-lived,
although the observation that these cells express low levels of the terminal differentiation
marker CD57 (Fig. S9F) suggests that they may be able to differentiate through nonhomeostatic proliferative mechanisms.

Escalating levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and dampening of bystander lunghoming activated cells predicts recovery from severe COVID-19
Finally, to better understand T cell features associated with survival of severe COVID19, we assessed longitudinal specimens from our ICU cohort (Table S1). While survivors tended
to increase the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells over time, non-survivors tended to not
have much of these cells to begin with, or the frequency of these cells stagnated or decreased
over time (Fig. 7A, B). We then analyzed the high-dimensional phenotyping datasets of the
longitudinal specimens for predictors of survival. Interestingly, total CD4+ and CD8+ T cell coexpressing CD69 and CXCR4 decreased over time in survivors, while the opposite was
observed for non-survivors. Correspondingly, CD69-CXCR4- T cell frequencies increased in the
days leading up to discharge from hospital, while they decreased in the days leading up to

death (Fig. 7C). As CD69 is an activation marker and CXCR4 directs cells to various tissues,
including the inflamed and damaged lung (Mamazhakypov et al., 2019), these observations
support a model whereby activated bystander T cells recruited to the lung lead to poor disease
outcome.
To provide further support for this model, we mined a public single-cell RNAseq
(scRNAseq) dataset (Liao et al., 2020) of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from
severe/critical COVID-19 patients, and compared it to BAL from moderate COVID-19 which
harbored lower lung viral loads (Fig. 7D). Elevated expression of CXCR4 was observed in T but
not epithelial cells of severe patients (Fig. 7E). Visualization of the T cells by UMAP (Fig. 7F,
S11A) revealed co-expression of CXCR4 and CD69 in the same subsets (Fig. 7G). These cells
likely infiltrated from the periphery as they express low levels of the T resident memory (Trm)
marker CD103 (Fig. 7H). To assess whether pulmonary T cells may themselves recruit more
CXCR4+ T cells, we assessed for expression of the CXCR4 ligands CXCL12 and HMGB1
(Schiraldi et al., 2012). While CXCL12 was not expressed (Fig. S11B), HMGB1 was, particularly
in a subset of CD8+ T cells over-represented in severe patients (Fig. 7I). These CD8+ T cells
comprise a unique cluster (Fig. S11C) and express relatively low levels of CXCR4 but high
levels of CD103 suggesting they are mostly Trm. Together, these data suggest that during
severe COVID-19, activated bystander T cells may, through expression of CXCR4, be recruited
to the lung by HMGB1 produced by pulmonary cells particularly CD8+ Trm cells, which could
contribute to COVID-19-associated mortality.

DISCUSSION
T cell lymphopenia was identified early on during the COVID-19 pandemic as a hallmark
of severe disease, implying an important role for T cells in the control of SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the
T cell subsets that may contribute to recovery and the role of T cells directly recognizing SARSCoV-2 epitopes has not been investigated in depth. In this study, we compared total and SARS-

CoV-2-specific T cells from mild, moderate, and severe cases of COVID-19, and within the
severe cases conducted in-depth analyses of longitudinal specimens to identify features
predicting who will survive severe COVID-19. As discussed below, we discovered T cell
features associated with recovery from disease, but also some implicated in disease
pathogenesis. As part of our study, we provide as a resource the raw CyTOF single-cell
datasets for all the total and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells for further data mining by the research
community (see methods).

Elevated levels of activated and exhausted T cells during severe COVID-19
The phenotypes of total T cells from COVID-19 patients from our study are largely
consistent with a recent study that conducted deep-profiling of immune cells (including T cells)
using high-parameter flow cytometry (Mathew et al., 2020). We, like the prior study, had
observed higher frequencies of CD8+ Ttm cells in mild patients, and a higher frequency of
activated, PD1-expressing T cells in severe patients. We also, similar to multiple other studies
(Mathew et al., 2020; Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020), found memory T cells to be
significantly more abundant in severe patients, although this was likely due to the older age of
the severe group, which affects memory cell frequencies (Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020).
Among SARS-CoV-2-specific cells, CD4+ Tem cells were increased in severe cases, but
CD4+ Temra cells were markedly depleted. The biological significance of this difference is
unclear, as both Tem and Temra cells can play important roles in antiviral immunity (Dunne et
al., 2002; Lilleri et al., 2008; Northfield et al., 2007; Sridhar et al., 2013; Weiskopf et al., 2015).
SARS-CoV-2-specific cTfh cells were also more abundant in moderate and severe cases, and
this paralleled a corresponding increase in total cTfh cells in more severe cases, the latter of
which was previously reported (Oja et al., 2020).
T cell exhaustion as defined by the exhaustion marker PD1 was reported early during
the pandemic (De Biasi et al., 2020; Diao et al., 2020) but a recent study suggested that PD1+

CD8+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 patients can be functional and that PD1 may more
often represent an activation marker in these individuals (Rha et al., 2020). We therefore looked
within our datasets for features of T cell exhaustion among our total and SARS-CoV-2-specific
cells. We defined exhausted cells as those dually expressing elevated PD1 and TIGIT, or PD1
and CTLA4. In both instances we found a significant increase in exhausted SARS-CoV-2specific T cells in severe cases. These results, together with the finding that T cells from
hospitalized patients activated by SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation express elevated transcript
levels of multiple exhaustion markers (PD1, TIGIT, LAG3, TIM3) relative to those from nonhospitalized patients (Meckiff et al., 2020), suggest that T cell exhaustion correlates with
disease severity. We also observed co-expression of PD1 with the Fas receptor CD95 involved
in apoptosis, and that PD1+CD95+ T cells, within both the total and SARS-CoV-2-specific
compartments, were elevated in severe relative to mild cases. These observations are in line
with an upregulation of CD95 transcripts on total T cells during COVID-19 (Zhu et al., 2020),
and with reports of apoptotic T cells during severe (Yao et al., 2020) and fatal (Feng et al.,
2020) COVID-19, during which elevated CD95 was observed in the dying cells. Together these
results suggest increased proportions of exhausted and apoptotic-prone T cells during severe
COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell frequency predicts survival from severe COVID-19
To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare via in-depth immune
phenotyping the features of T cells from severe (ICU) COVID-19 patients that do vs. do not
survive disease. We discovered in a cross-sectional analysis that survivors mounted a higher
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, and longitudinal analyses revealed that this response
increases in survivors prior to recovery, whereas it does not in non-survivors. These data
suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are protective during severe COVID-19, and are in
line with a number of other reports, including: a recent report of greater expansion of SARS-

CoV-2-specific T cells during moderate than severe COVID-19 (Liao et al., 2020); the finding
that antigen-specific T cells against SARS-CoV-1, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, are
protective in mouse infection models (Zhao et al., 2016); and a recent study demonstrating
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, as defined by AIM markers, to be associated with less
severe disease (Rydyznski Moderbacher et al., 2020). Although that latter study did not focus
on fatal vs. non-fatal outcomes, it included one fatal case with longitudinal sampling, and
observed that patient to have had no detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses 16 and
11 days prior to death, in line with our findings. Of note, however, a separate research group
reported the opposite trend—AIM-identified SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells associating with more
severe disease—although the results did not meet statistical significance (Anft et al., 2020;
Thieme et al., 2020). Regardless, our data comparing fatal vs. non-fatal severe COVID-19 are
consistent with the notion SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells being beneficial rather than detrimental
for surviving severe COVID-19. That being said, we did find that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T
cells co-producing IFNg and IL6 were elevated in individuals that did not survive severe disease.
Plasma IL6 levels associate with COVID-19 severity (Huang et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020) and predict COVID-19-associated death (Del Valle et al., 2020). However,
save a study that reported elevated IL6 production in total CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients
in the ICU, IL6 is not thought to be produced by T cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether
IL6 production by SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells directly contributes to
immunopathogenesis remains to be determined.

Potential mechanisms underlying diminished SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in
non-survivors of severe COVID-19
Our data suggest multiple mechanisms by which severe patients may control the
production of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Hospitalized patients that produced few SARSCoV-2-specific T cells—and were more likely to die—harbored higher frequencies of SARS-

CoV-2-specific Tregs. Although little is known about SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs, the proportion
of Tregs among total T cells has been reported to be both increased (De Biasi et al., 2020) and
decreased (Qin et al., 2020) during severe COVID-19. Consistent with increased levels of Tregs
during severe infection are observations of disease severity positively associating with levels
IL10, a regulatory cytokine commonly produced by Tregs (Han et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b).
We did not observe increased levels of total Tregs in fatal vs. non-fatal cases of severe COVID19, but the increased number of SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs in non-survivors may suffice to
hinder the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific effector T cells.
Our finding may seem at odds with a recent study suggesting a decrease in SARS-CoV2-specific Tregs during severe disease (Meckiff et al., 2020). However, differences in
experimental design likely account for the differences. While our study compared ICU patients
that survived vs. did not survive, the other study compared ICU patients to non-hospitalized
ones. Furthermore, the prior study identified SARS-CoV-2-specific Tregs as those expressing
AIM markers after stimulating for 24 hours with SARS-CoV-2 peptides, while we identified the
cells as those producing IFNg after 6 hours of stimulation. As all the SARS-CoV-2-specific cells
characterized in our study were defined based on IFNg induction, the SARS-CoV-2-specific
Tregs we identified are in fact a subset of all possible Tregs. These IFNg+ Tregs have been
reported to play important roles during graft rejection and autoimmunity (Daniel et al., 2008;
McClymont et al., 2011), but to our knowledge have not been described during viral infections.
Another potential mechanism accounting for increased frequencies of SARS-CoV-2specific T cells in survivors is their harboring increased expression of CD127, a component of
the IL7 receptor complex important for homeostatic proliferation. We recently demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from convalescent patients homeostatically proliferate in response
to IL7 signaling (Neidleman et al., 2020a), demonstrating the expansion potential of these cells.
We speculate that during severe COVID-19, elevated expression of CD127 allows SARS-CoV-

2-specific T cells to expand more rapidly and thereby persist in sufficient quantities to aid in
recovery.

CXCR4 antagonism as target for T cell-mediated immunopathogenesis in the lung
One of the most interesting findings of this study came out of our analysis of longitudinal
specimens from fatal vs. non-fatal severe cases, where we found CXCR4+CD69+ T cells
decreasing over time in those that survive, and increasing in those that do not. CXCR4 plays
important roles in lymphocyte chemotaxis and in homing of hematopoietic stem cells to bone
marrow. Its primary ligand, CXCL12, is expressed in multiple tissues, but of importance for this
study, is elevated in the damaged lung, particularly the lung vasculature (Mamazhakypov et al.,
2019). Interestingly, CD69+CXCR4+ T cells have been found at elevated levels in non-small cell
lung cancer tissues as compared to normal lung tissue (Wald et al., 2006), suggesting their
increased presence under pathologic conditions. Indeed, we found that T cells expressing
CXCR4 and CD69 are in fact elevated in BAL of severe COVID-19 patients. These cells likely
migrated from the periphery as they express low levels of the Trm marker CD103. Consistent
with an infiltration of pathogenic T cells during severe COVID-19 are observations that
pulmonary T cells during critical as compared to moderate disease expressed fewer tissueresident transcripts (Liao et al., 2020) and proteins (Oja et al., 2020). Trm cells may, however,
play a role in pathogenesis by producing the CXCR4 ligand HMGB1, which, consistent with our
findings, has been reported to be elevated during fatal COVID-19 (Chen et al., 2020b).
Together with the observation of activation of CMV- and EBV-specific T cells during the
acute phase of COVID-19 (Sekine et al., 2020), these findings bring up the possibility that
during critical and fatal COVID-19, T cells in the periphery activated through bystander effects
are recruited to the lung via CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis, and this contributes to pulmonary
damage. If CXCR4-driven T cell infiltration does indeed contribute to fatal COVID-19, then
inhibitors against this receptor may be useful. AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist that has been

used to mobilize stem cells (Cashen et al., 2007), could be tested in clinical trials. Of note,
optimized derivatives of a peptide called EPI-X4, originally discovered by virtue of its ability to
inhibit CXCR4-tropic HIV infection of target cells (Zirafi et al., 2015), exhibit superior activity over
AMD3100 for blocking CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis, and have been shown to potently block
migration of immune cells into the lungs of asthmatic mice (Harms et al., 2020). These
derivatives represent intriguing candidates for treatment of severe COVID-19.

Conclusions
In summary, our findings overall support a beneficial rather than immunopathologic role
for effector SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells during severe acute infection. This was evidenced by
survivors of severe infection exhibiting: 1) escalating SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell numbers
before recovery, 2) increased levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with homeostatic
proliferative potential, and 3) diminished numbers of immunosuppressive SARS-CoV-2-specific
Tregs. The mechanisms by which T cells would help recovery from severe infection is not clear,
but likely involves providing B cell help and direct cytolysis of infected cells. In addition, as IFNg
downregulates ACE2 (de Lang et al., 2006), production of this cytokine by SARS-CoV-2-specific
T cells may limit the availability of host cells for the virus. Exceptions to the notion of “beneficial”
T cells, however, are our observations of non-survivors expressing elevated levels of IL6producing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, and the increase of activated, lung-homing
bystander T cells in the days leading up to death. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the
longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells (Zuo et al., 2020), our results suggest that strategies
to boost the effector functions of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, including by vaccination, will be
beneficial for decreasing COVID-19 mortality and helping to end this devastating pandemic.

Our study has limitations. To enable deep-phenotyping of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells,
we had to characterize a relatively small cohort of 34 infected individuals. This may have
accounted for our inability to detect sex-based differences. A second limitation was our use of
peptide stimulation to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific cells. The phenotypes of our SARS-CoV-2specific T cells therefore correspond to those immediately following antigen encounter, rather
than at baseline. Importantly, however, we did not compare the phenotypes of baseline cells to
SARS-CoV-2-specific ones, as such a comparison would include artifacts resulting from the
stimulation. Instead, we always compared SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells between different
patient groups. Future studies using tetramers will be needed to assess the phenotypes of
baseline SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells along the entire spectrum of COVID-19 disease. Such
studies, however, would be limited to analyzing responses against a small number of epitopes,
and would be for the most part limited to CD8+ T cells as tetramer reagents for CD4+ T cells are
generally not reliable. A third limitation was our restricting analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cells to those recognizing the spike protein, which elicits a limited CD8+ T cell response. Future
studies should examine responses against proteins more commonly recognized by SARS-CoV2-specific CD8+ T cells (Ferretti et al., 2020). Fourthly, this study was a phenotyping and
correlative study, so follow-up functional assays will be required to establish cause vs. effect.
Finally, our CyTOF analysis was limited to cells from the blood, although we confirmed the
presence of activated CXCR4+ T cells in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Subjects
Blood was drawn from 34 SARS-CoV-2-infected and 11 uninfected individuals. Infection status
was established by RT-PCR. Of the infected individuals, 19 experienced a severe course of
disease as defined by being in the ICU (designated “survivor” in this study), and 6 of these
individuals died from COVID-19 (designated “non-survivor” in this study). Moderate cases were
defined as non-ICU hospitalizations for COVID-19. Eight of the individuals that experienced
severe disease were sampled longitudinally at up to 4 timepoints. All specimens from
hospitalized patients were from a timepoint when the patients were still hospitalized, and this
ranged from 0-76 days after initial positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Mild cases consisted of those
never hospitalized for COVID-19, and were generally analyzed 20-154 after initial positive
SARS-CoV-2 test. While specimens from mild, moderate, and severe cases may have been
collected at similar times after infection, the specimens from the moderate and severe cases
were from hospitalized individuals, and are therefore considered acute specimens. By contrast,

specimens from the mild cases were from outpatient individuals that were no longer
symptomatic at the time of sampling and therefore can be considered convalescent specimens.
Additional clinical features, including patient gender, age, race, and whether patients were given
convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, or remdesivir for COVID-19, are indicated in Table S1.
Consistent with male sex, advanced age, and non-white race being risk factors for severe
disease, mild cases were predominantly female (81%, vs. 48% for hospitalized patients),
younger (median age 41, vs. 64 for hospitalized patients), and all of white ethnicity (vs. 72%
LatinX for hospitalized patients). The demographics of severe fatal vs. non-fatal cases of
COVID-19 were more closely matched. In our cohort, fatal cases were more frequently female
(67%, vs. 54% for non-fatal), older (median age 73, vs. 64 for non-fatal), and LatinX (100%, vs.
61.5% for non-fatal). Hospitalized patients were all from the Zuckerberg San Francisco General
Hospital (ZSFG), while out-patients were recruited from the COVID-19 Host Immune
Pathogenesis (CHIRP) study. This study was approved by the University of California, San
Francisco (IRB # 20-30588).

METHOD DETAILS
Preparation of specimens for CyTOF
On the day of each blood draw, PBMCs were isolated from blood using LymphoprepTM
(StemCell Technologies). Six million cells were then immediately treated with cisplatin (SigmaAldrich) as a live/dead marker and fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) as previously described
(Ma et al., 2020; Neidleman et al., 2020a), unless there were insufficient cell numbers in which
case fewer cells were treated in this manner. Fixation was carried out by resuspending cells in 2
ml PBS (Rockland) with 2 mM EDTA (Corning), and then adding 2 ml of PBS containing 2 mM
EDTA and 25 μM cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich). After 1 min of incubation, cisplatin staining was
quenched with 10 ml of CyFACS (metal contaminant-free PBS (Rockland) supplemented with
0.1% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich)). The cells were then centrifuged,

resuspended in 2% PFA in CyFACS, and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. After
two more washes with CyFACS, cells were resuspended in CyFACS containing 10% DMSO
and stored at -80°C until analysis by CyTOF. These cells constituted the “baseline” specimens.
The remaining cells were stimulated for 6 hours with the co-stimulatory agents 0.5 µg/ml
anti-CD49d clone L25 and 0.5 µg/ml anti-CD28 clone L293 (both from BD Biosciences) and 0.5
μM of overlapping 15-mer SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides PepMix™ SARS-CoV-2 Peptide (Spike
Glycoprotein) (JPT Peptide Technologies) in RP10 media (RPMI 1640 medium (Corning)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, VWR), 1% penicillin (Gibco), and 1%
streptomycin (Gibco)). To test the functionality of the IL6 antibody, PBMCs were stimulated
instead with 200 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide LPS (Sigma-Aldrich). A final concentration of 3 µg/ml
Brefeldin A Solution (eBioscience) was also included to enable detection of intracellular
cytokines. For samples that had sufficient cell yield, a positive control of stimulation with 16 nM
PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 μm ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) was additionally included. Treated
cells were then cisplatin-treated and PFA-fixed as described above.

CyTOF staining and data acquisition
CyTOF staining was conducted using recently described methods (Cavrois et al., 2017;
Ma et al., 2020; Neidleman et al., 2020a; Neidleman et al., 2020b). Cisplatin-treated cells were
thawed and washed with CyFACS in Nunc 96 DeepWellTM polystyrene plates (Thermo Fisher)
at a concentration of 6 x 106 cells / 800 μl in each well. Cells were then blocked with mouse
(Thermo Fisher), rat (Thermo Fisher), and human AB (Sigma-Aldrich) sera for 15 minutes at
4°C. Samples were then washed twice in CyFACS and stained at 4°C for 45 minutes with
surface CyTOF antibodies (Table S2) in a final volume of 100 µl. The samples were then
washed three times with CyFACS, and fixed overnight at 4°C in 100 μl of 2% PFA in PBS.
Samples were then washed twice with Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer

(eBioscience) and incubated for 45 minutes at 4°C. After two additional washes with
Permeabilization Buffer (eBioscience), samples were blocked for 15 minutes at 4°C in 100 μl of
mouse and rat sera diluted in Permeabilization Buffer. After another round of washing with
Permeabilization Buffer, samples were stained at 4°C for 45 minutes with intracellular CyTOF
antibodies (Table S2) in a final volume of 100 µl. The cells were then washed with CyFACS, and
stained for 20 minutes at room temperature with 250 nM of Cell-IDTM Intercalator-IR (Fluidigm).
Immediately prior to sample acquisition, cells were washed twice with CyFACS buffer, once with
MaxPar® cell staining buffer (Fluidigm), and once with Cell acquisition solution (CAS, Fluidigm),
and then resuspended in EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) diluted in CAS.
Samples were acquired on a Helios-upgraded CyTOF2 instrument (Fluidigm) at the UCSF
Parnassus flow core facility.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATICAL ANALYSIS
CyTOF data analysis
CyTOF datasets were exported as flow cytometry standard (FCS) files, and de-barcoded
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Fluidigm). FlowJo software (BD Biosciences) was
used to identify CD4+ T cells (live, singlet CD3+CD19-CD4+CD8-) and CD8+ T cells (live,
singlet CD3+CD19-CD4-CD8+) among the baseline and stimulated samples. Peptide-stimulated
samples were further separated into bystander (IFNg-) and SARS-CoV-2-specific (IFNg+) T
cells. For subset and high-dimensional analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, we excluded
patients with fewer than three SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to limit skewing of data. All subset
percentages were reported relative to number of live, singlet PBMCs, or the indicated T cell
subset. t-SNE analyses were performed using the Cytobank software with default settings. All
phenotyping cellular markers not used in the upstream gating strategy were included in
generating the t-SNE plots. Non-cellular markers (e.g., live/dead stain) and cytokines were

excluded for the generation of t-SNE plots. Dot plots were generated using both Cytobank and
FlowJo. Clustering was conducted using the unsupervised clustering algorithm FlowSOM (Van
Gassen et al., 2015) within Cytobank, using default settings (Clustering method: Hierarchical
consensus; Iterations: 10; Seed: Automatic). The same parameters used in t-SNE plot
generation were used as FlowSOM clustering parameters. The statistical tests used in
comparison of groups are indicated within the figure legends.

Antibody Measurement
IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and
nucleocapsid protein (NP) were measured in samples from patients that did not receive
convalescent plasma, using the Pylon 3D automated immunoassay system (ET Healthcare) as
described (Lynch et al., 2020). Briefly, quartz glass probes precoated with either affinity-purified
goat anti-human IgM (to capture IgM) or Protein G (to capture IgG) were dipped into 15 µl of
diluted patient plasma. After washing, the probe was dipped into the assay reagent containing
both biotinylated recombinant RBD and NP. After additional washes, the probe was incubated
with a Cy5-conjugated streptavidin polysaccharide conjugate reagent. The backgroundcorrected signal was reported as relative fluorescent units (RFU), reflecting the relative levels of
specific antibodies in each specimen.

Analysis of public scRNAseq datasets of COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens
FASTQ files generated from BAL samples of two moderate (GSM4339769, GSM4339770) and
six severe/critical patients were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database under accession code GSE145926
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145926) (Liao et al., 2020). These
scRNAseq datasets were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 5’ library preparation kit
(10X Genomics). Cell Ranger software version 3.1.0 (10x Genomics) was used to generate the

filtered cell-barcode matrices. A standard Seurat v.3 workflow (Stuart et al., 2019) was used to
generate cell clusters after filtering out dead cells (those containing more than 10% of
mitochondrial gene counts). T and epithelial cell clusters were then extracted from each sample,
by identification of clusters expressing the CD3 and EPACM genes, respectively. The filtered
gene-barcode matrices for the extracted cells were normalized using ‘LogNormalize’ with default
parameters. The top 2,000 variable genes were then identified using the ‘vst’ method by the
‘FindVariableFeatures’ function. To integrate the 8 BAL samples and remove potential batch
effects, we used the standard integration Seurat v.3 workflow. The first 30 dimensions from
canonical correlation analysis (CCA) were used as the input parameter for the
‘FindTransferAnchors’ function. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the
top 2,000 variable genes of the integrated matrix, followed by implementation of the graphbased clustering algorithm on the PCA-reduced data. Finally, UMAP visualizations were
generated using the top 30 PCA. The UMAP resolution was set to 0.8. To detect SARS-CoV-2
transcripts, a customized reference genome/transcriptome was built by integrating the both
human GRCh38 and SARS-CoV-2 genomes (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome, GenBank MN908947.3
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3/) and FASTQ alignment was performed
using the splice-aware aligner STAR (Dobin et al., 2013).

datasets reflecting percentages of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells producing IFNg at baseline or in
response to a 6-hour stimulation with overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 spike in
representative donors from mild, moderate, and severe cases. Results are gated on live, singlet
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. (B) Percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFNg in response

Not shown are the opposite trend for CXCR4+CD69+ cells which over time decrease in
survivors and increase in non-survivors. (D-I) Higher levels of infiltrating CXCR4+CD69+ T cells
are present in lungs of severe/critical vs. moderate COVID-19 patients as determined by mining
of public BAL scRNAseq datasets. Higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral reads in T and epithelial
cells were detected during severe COVID-19 (D), which were also associated with higher levels
of CXCR4 in T cells as depicted by violin plots (E). Note viral reads detected in T cells likely
reflect cell-surface virion sticking as these cells do not express ACE2. UMAP visualization of T
and epithelial cells from the scRNAseq datasets (F) revealed elevated expression of CXCR4
and CD69 on subsets of T cells (G) separate from T cells expressing high levels of the Trm

Figure S1. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells by AIM and cytokine production –
Related to Figure 1. (A-C) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were assessed for the production of
activation-induced markers (AIM) in pairs (A), or of individual cytokines IFNg, IL4, IL5, and IL17
(B, C) in the absence or presence of stimulation with overlapping 15-mers spanning SARS-CoV2 spike. (A) The AIM markers were assessed in baseline and SARS-CoV-2 peptide-stimulated
samples from a representative severe COVID-19 patient. Although AIM markers were
upregulated upon peptide stimulation, they were also expressed at substantial levels in the
baseline samples, and responding cells could not be clearly distinguished from non-responding
cells based on AIM expression. Numbers refer to the percentages of cells within the
corresponding gates. (B) Peptide stimulation of CD4+ T cells from the donor from panel A
induced the production of IFNg, but not IL4, IL5, IL6, and IL17. Numbers refer to the
percentages of cells within the corresponding gates. (C) Cumulative data from all donors

survivor relative to the non-survivor group. Right: Cells from cluster B8.6 express high levels of
activation markers HLADR, CD38, and CCR5, and low levels of the Tcm markers CCR7 and
CD62L. Expression levels from cluster B8.6 are displayed in pink, while those from total CD8+ T
cells are displayed in grey. (D) Among all clusters of total CD8+ T cells, cells from cluster B8.6
express the highest levels of HLADR. (E) Survivors of severe COVID-19 express elevated
frequencies of activated (CD38+CCR5+) CD8+ T cells. (F) Survivors of severe COVID-19
harbor more SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells expressing low levels CD57 and CD49d. Left:
Cluster S8.2 was enriched in survivors. Right: Cells from cluster S8.2 do not express elevated
levels of HLADR, CD38, or CD127, and express low levels of the terminal differentiation marker

CD57 and the integrin component CD49d. Expression levels from cluster S8.2 are displayed in
pink, while those from total SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cells are displayed in grey. * p < 0.05 as
determined by a Student’s unpaired t-test. (G) The proportions of CD127+ cells among SARSCoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells are similar between survivors and non-survivors of severe COVID19. * p < 0.05 as determined by a Student’s unpaired t-test.

Figure S10. Distinct phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell clusters enriched in
survivors vs. non-survivors of severe COVID-19 – Related to Figure 6. SARS-CoV-2-

specific FlowSOM cluster S4.5 (enriched in non-survivors) and S4.9 (enriched in
survivors) described in Fig. 6E were examined in more detail. Among activation
markers, both clusters expressed elevated levels of HLADR, CD38, CCR5, and Ox40,
while S4.9 selectively upregulated CD69, and S4.5 selectively upregulated ICOS, PD1,
and CTLA4. Of note, PD1 and CTLA4 additionally serve as exhaustion markers. The
tissue homing receptors CCR6 and CD49d, Tcm markers (CCR7, CD62L), the cTfh
marker CXCR5, and CD127 were upregulated in cluster S4.9.

Figure S11. Subset identification of T and epithelial cells from lungs of COVID-19 patients
– Related to Figure 7. (A) The CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and epithelial cell subsets were

extracted from public scRNAseq datasets generated from BAL of COVID-19 patients
with moderate or severe/critical disease as illustrated in Fig. 7F, and verified by
assessing RNA expression levels of the T cell marker CD3D, CD4, the alpha chain of
CD8 (CD8A), and the epithelial marker EpCAM. Expression levels are depicted as
UMAP heatmaps. (B) In contrast to HMGB1 (Fig. 7I), the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 is
poorly expressed in T and epithelial cells of the lung. (C) Clustering of pulmonary T and
