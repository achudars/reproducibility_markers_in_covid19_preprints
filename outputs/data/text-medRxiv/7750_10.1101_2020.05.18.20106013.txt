Abstract
Despite some similarities of the dynamic of COVID-19 spread in Morocco and
other countries, the infection, recovery and death rates remain very variable.
In this paper, we analyze the spread dynamics of COVID-19 in Morocco within
a standard susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered–death (SEIRD) model. We
have combined SEIRD model with a time–dependent infection rate function, to
fit the real data of i) infection counts and ii) death rates due to COVID-19, for
the period between March 2nd and Mai 15th 2020. By fitting the infection rate,
SEIRD model placed the infection peak on 04/24/2020 and could reproduce it
to a large extent on the expense of recovery and death rates. Fitting the SEIRD
model to death rates gives rather satisfactory predictions with a maximum of
infections on 04/06/2020. Regardless of the low peak position, the confirmed
cases and transmission rate were well reproduced.

1. Introduction
The spread of an epidemic disease depends on the availability of susceptible
individuals that can lead the virus to survive. New susceptible persons will keep
transmission between individuals and therefore promote the virus to survive.

As the severe acute respiratory disease COVID-19 presents a high transmission
rate, it will very likely save it from been extinct, at least for several years. To

slow-down the transmission of COVID-19 among the population and to avoid
a high fatality rate, each country was forced to adopt drastic containment and
preventive measures going from social distancing to a complete lock-down of the
10

entire country.

Earlier in March 2020, Morocco found itself fighting against COVID-19,
which seems to be one of the worst waves of transmissible diseases that hits
the country in the past 200 years. Morocco took strict preventive measures to
15

limit the spread of the virus, including the closure of borders, the nationwide
lock-down, as well as the compulsory wearing of face-masks. Thanks to these
measures, the COVID-19 spread seems to be controlled so far. However, a clear
picture regarding the magnitude and the dynamics of the epidemic wave is still
not yet drawn.

20

In this paper, we report the result of modeling the outbreak of COVID-19
in Morocco using SEIRD model, we discuss the validity and limits of the model
and we give an estimate of the magnitude of the epidemic wave, i.e. number
of infected individuals, transmission rate and an estimated end of the epidemic
25

wave.

2. Methods and Theory
Although its novelty, the corona virus COVID-19 seems to follow the same
spread dynamic like other pathogens. Since the outstanding work by W. O.
Kermack and A. G. McKendrick [1] who laid the foundation of the SIR model
30

(susceptible-infected-recovered), several mathematical models have been developed to describe the spread of several infectious diseases [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Nowadays,
these models are not new and have many open-source Python and Matlab code
implementations available online.
In this work, we have used a known mathematical model, which consists of five

35

compartments (S − E − I − R − D): Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected

(I), Recovered (R) and Dead (D). Any individual in the fraction of the population that will get sick belongs to one of the aforementioned compartments.
Since COVID-19 has an incubation time, the E compartment (for exposed)
is allocated for individuals that have been infected but are not yet infectious

themselves. The system of equations in the SEIRD model is given by:

where N is the total number of individuals in the considered population. At
each time N is equal to the sum of (Eq.1) N = S + E + I + R + D. β represents
the infection rate, i.e., an expected amount of people an infected person infects
per day, α is the incubation rate and TI is the average infectious period and f
is the rate at which people die. The same model has been used elsewhere [7]
to describe the widespread of COVID-19 in Italy. The total number of infected
people in a population is determined by the R0 number. This can be expressed
as the infection rate multiplied by the mean time of recovery or deaths. It
describes the expected number of individuals an infected person infects in a
susceptible population. Equivalently, R0 is computed as:
R0

= β.TI

The system of Eq.(1) is solved with initial conditions [S(t0 ), E(t0 ), I(t0 ), R(t0 ), D(t0 )]
for some initial time t0 . To test the model, we have used a set of parameters and
initial conditions found in literature for the COVID-19 spread in China and Italy
[α = 0.1, 1/TI = 2.73.10−2 , f = 0.3 − 0.6], [S(t0 ) = N − 1, E(t0 ) = 1, 0, 0, 0]
and let β float (data not shown). Although the model reproduces the gross features of the full time course of the data, it gives rather unrealistic values for the

transmission rate β. The projection of COVID-19 dynamics in China and Italy
to that of Morocco seems to be very rough, as the prevention measures taken by
each country differ greatly. The latter should cause a decrease in the number of
contacts between Infected and Susceptible population. Thus, β cannot remain
constant or even abruptly jumps from one value to another. Therefore, we have
adopted a time–dependent β(t) decreasing function of the form:

3.1. Adjusting the Model to real data

3.1.1. Daily infections I(t)
In order to come as close as possible to the real numbers and make informed
predictions of the COVID-19 spread in Morocco, SEIRD model has been fitted
to daily reported infection counts of COVID-19 data, for the period between
March 2nd and Mai 15th 2020 (03/02/2020 − 05/15/2020), using the time–

50

dependent β(t) function. To initialize the system of equations, the following
initial parameters [S(t0 ) = N − 1, E(t0 ) = 1, 0, 0, 0] have been used, where N ,
represents the total number of population of Morocco and t0 corresponds to the
first day of the first infected person. Morocco has detected the first infection on
March 2nd . Thus, the infection could have in fact been days or weeks earlier.

55

Consequently, we have tried several negative lag-time between 05 ≤ t0 ≤ 20.

The t0 value which seems to reproduce best the data was 7 days. Note that
a lag-time of t0 = 30 days has been observed for Italy in order to reproduce
the outset of the outbreak [10]. The best-fit parameters as well as those fixed
are reported in table 1. Figure 1 (a) represents the best-fit to the daily counts
60

of infections of COVID-19 in Morocco. It is noteworthy to visualize that the
inflection point of I(t) was very well reproduced with our model, although it
seems to underestimates the reported values around April 20th and Mai 8th .
As the set of initial conditions were adequately adjusted, we believe that this
mismatch is very likely due to the abrupt change in testing rate at this period

65

related to the presence of several hotbeds of contagion throughout the country.
One can also note that starting from March 8th a visible increase of the number of infections is also accompanied by an increasing number of the performed
tests. Figure 2 (a) represents the predicted evolution of COVID-19 spread in
Morocco, as calculated using the parameters set in table 1. It can be remarked

70

from Figure 2 (a) that the global fit of the SEIRD model to the I(t) COVID-19
data in Morocco, while predicting the observed position of the epidemic peak,
it does so at the price of a bad estimation of the growth of recovered and death
population. Figure 3 (a) illustrates the evolution of the reproductive number
R0 (t) as function of time. The assessment of R0 = 2.05, looks reasonable at

75

the early stage of the epidemic period, though it is much lower than that of
COVID-19 worldwide. Such low predicted R0 would inevitably induce a massive decrease of the infected population. The total number of the cumulative
confirmed cases (C = R + D) is also underestimated (see Figure 4), this suggests that the decay of the infection rate I(t) is higher than that recorded for

80

the data. This discrepancy will very likely to get reduced when more data on
the COVID-19 spread in Morocco will be available.

Despite, its reproducibility of the infection dynamics, the analysis of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco, using the fit of SEIRD model seems to be very
85

crude. First, the data contain several spikes and looks noisy (though it has
been averaged), and second the number of tests that have been performed, is

very low, as compared to those performed in Italy, Germany or China. Note
that during the early stage of the epidemic period, Morocco made tests to only
those who presented COVID-19 symptoms, so obviously, infected individuals
90

who did not present symptoms, have escaped to the tests. This explains the
low estimation of confirmed cases.

3.1.2. Death rate D(t)
In order to avoid external factors and get more accurate analysis of the
95

COVID-19 spread in Morocco, SEIRD model has been fitted death cases due to
COVID-19 in Morocco, for the period between 03/02/2020 − 05/15/2020. As
Morocco, did not have an intensive wave of death cases due to COVID-19, as
the one observed in Italy or China for example, the reported COVID-19 death
cases should be reliable as it is hard to miss any case.

100

To initialize the system of equations, we have used the same initial parameters
[S(t0 ) = N − 1, E(t0 ) = 1, 0, 0, 0] with t0 = 7. The best-fit parameters as
well as those fixed are reported in table 1. Figure 1 (b) represents the best-fit
to the reported death cases due to COVID-19 in Morocco. The fit gives rather
satisfactory reproduction of the expected ”S” shape of the death data. Further,

105

it reaches a plateau of about 220 death cases, which looks quite reasonable, if
considering the low number of individuals in intensive care and the low fatality
rate ' 0.03 in Morocco. This suggests also that our fixed initial conditions
were very well estimated. Figure 2 (b) represents the predicted evolution of
COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco, as calculated using the parameters set in table

110

1. As it is seen from Figure 2 (b), the position of the epidemic peak, occurs
18 days earlier than the one reported in real data and also the number of the
infected individuals is ten times higher than that in the real case. Analysis of
R0 = 2.5 at the early stage of the epidemic period seems be rather satisfactory
as it agrees very well with that computed from the real reported infection data

115

(Figure 3). This also explains the low infection cases and low fatality rate seen
in Morocco. It is important to note that starting from 03/30/2020, R0 (t) de-

creased considerably as a result of preventive measures together with complete
nation lock-down, adopted by the Moroccan Government on 03/20/2020 (just
10 days later).
120

Indeed, the flaw of the model in predicting the infection rate will undoubtedly get reduced when more data on the COVID-19 outbreak in Morocco will
be available but one can already make some remarks. The down-shift of the
epidemic peak as well as the predicted large number of infected cases can be
125

understood if we take into account the initial low testing performed by Morocco,
especially at the early stage of the epidemic period. Theoretically, by increasing
the testing rate, we can expect a down-shift of the inflection point and an increase of infected cases, as this population would be detected earlier. One more
important evidence about the robustness of this model is the total number of

130

confirmed cases C(t) which saturates at ' 7000. Figure 4 shows the evolution
of the predicted confirmed cases C(t) together with real COVID-19 data. Even
if the predicted curve is down shifted (as consequence of the inflection point in
the predicted infection curve), both curves seems to follow the same trend, with
a constant difference (due always to the same reasons discussed above). The

135

predicted saturation value saturates at the end of the epidemic wave (' 7000),
seems to be realistic with the trend of COVID-19 dynamics in Morocco, unless
other external factors enter into account such as hotbeds of contagion.

4. Conclusion
140

In this paper, we have analyzed the data of COVID-19 epidemic wave that
hits the Moroccan territory starting from March 2nd . Thanks to the aggressiveness of containment measures, the country has recorded one of the low death
rates across the Globe. The analysis of COVID-19 data using a standard model
composed of five compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered and

145

dead (SEIRD) during the period 03/02/2020 − 05/15/2020 suggest that the

country has already gone through the peak of infections with a minimum of infection is expected around 06/14/2020. The fit of SEIRD model to the COVID19 infection counts in Morocco, placed the infection peak on 04/24/2020 and
could reproduce to large extent the daily number of infections. However, it
150

underestimates the recovery and death rates, leading thus to a low prediction
of the total number of the confirmed cases. The R0 = 2.05 at the beginning
of the epidemic period is lower than that expected for COVID-19 worldwide.
Even if the model seems to be reliable in predicting the infection rates, it does
so at the expense of other compartment of the population. Accordingly, the

155

interpretation of such predictions should be take with care. On the other hand,
fitting the SEIRD model to death rates due to COVID-19, looks more reliable
especially as the data did not depend on external factors. Indeed, the death rate
depends on several factors, like the health system, the average age of the elderly
people, their health conditions, availability of intensive care units, etc. But in

160

the absence of statistics regarding the factors influencing death rates, it is still
premature to draw conclusions. Besides that, the fit gives rather satisfactory
reproduction of the death data. Further, it reaches a plateau of about 220 death
cases, which seems reasonable, with the data reported so far. The drawback of
such approach is the down-shift of the position of the epidemic peak and the

165

large number of infections reported on that day. Although, this is rather harsh
but it still not very surprising if taking into account the low testing rate. Moreover, the predicted R0 and the total number of infections C(t) further support
the robustness of this approach when fitting the model to data.
