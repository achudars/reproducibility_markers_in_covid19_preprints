Summary
Background COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is primarily diagnosed
using laboratory tests, which are frequently not administered until after symptom onset. However, SARSCoV-2 is contagious multiple days before symptom onset and diagnosis, thus enhancing its transmission
through the population.
Methods In this retrospective study, we collected 15 seconds to one-minute heart rate and steps interval
data from Fitbit devices during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 until June 2020). Resting heart rate
was computed by selecting the heart rate intervals where steps were zero for 12 minutes ahead of an
interrogated time point. Data for each participant was divided into train or baseline by taking the days
before the non-infectious period and test data by taking the days during the COVID-19 infectious period.
Data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training days. Here, we developed a deep learning
approach based on a Long Short-Term Memory Networks-based autoencoder, called LAAD, to predict
COVID-19 infection by detecting abnormal resting heart rate in test data relative to the user’s baseline.
Findings We detected an abnormal resting heart rate during the period of viral infection (7 days before
the symptom onset and 21 days after) in 92% (23 out of 25 cases) of patients with laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19. In 56% (14) of cases, LAAD detection identified cases in their pre-symptomatic phase
whereas 36% (9 cases) were detected after the onset of symptoms with an average precision score of 0·91
(SD 0·13, 95% CI 0·854–0·967), a recall score of 0·36 (0·295, 0·232–0·487), and a F-beta score of 0·79
(0·226, 0·693–0·888). In COVID-19 positive patients, abnormal RHR patterns start 5 days before
symptom onset (6·9 days in pre-symptomatic cases and 1·9 days later in post-symptomatic cases).
COVID-19+ patients have longer abnormal resting heart rate periods (89 hours or 3·7 days) as compared
to healthy individuals (25 hours or 1·1 days).
Interpretation These findings show that deep learning neural networks and wearables data are an
effective method for the early detection of COVID-19 infection. Additional validation data will help
guide the use of this and similar techniques in real-world infection surveillance and isolation policies to
reduce transmission and end the pandemic.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
COVID-19 resulted in up to 1·7 million deaths worldwide in 2020. COVID-19 detection using laboratory
tests is usually performed after symptom onset. This delay can allow the spread of viral infection and can
cause outbreaks. We searched PubMed, Google, and Google Scholar for research articles published in
English up to Dec 1, 2020, using common search terms including “COVID-19 and wearables”, “Resting
heart rate and viral infection”, “Resting heart rate and COVID-19”, “machine learning and COVID-19”
and “deep-learning and COVID-19”. Previous studies have attempted to use an elevated resting heart rate
as an indicator of viral infection. Although these studies have investigated the early prediction of COVID19 using resting heart rate and other wearables data, studies to investigate a deep learning-based
prediction model with performance evaluation metrics at the user level has not been reported.
Added value of this study
In this study, we created a deep-learning system that used wearables data such as abnormal resting heart
rate to predict COVID-19 before the symptom onset. The deep-learning system was created using
retrospective time-series datasets collected from 25 COVID-19+ patients, 11 non-COVID-19, and 70
healthy individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first deep-learning model to identify an early viral
infection using wearables data at the user level. This study also greatly extends our previous phase-1
study and factors unpredictable behavior and time-series nature of the data, limited data size, and lack of
data labels to evaluate performance metrics. The use of a real-time version of this model using more data
along with user feedback may help to scale early detection as the number of patients with COVID-19
continues to grow.
Implications of all the available evidence
In the future, wearable devices may provide high-resolution sleep, temperature, saturated oxygen,
respiration rate, and electrocardiogram, which could be used to further characterize an individual’s
baseline and improve the deep-learning model performance for infectious disease detection. Using multisensor data with a real-time deep-learning model has the potential to alert individuals of illness prior to
symptom onset and may greatly reduce the viral spread.

Introduction
COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).1 As of 6 December 2020, more than 66·7 million people have
been infected world-wide with 14·6 million in the U.S alone, and the number of cases continues to rise.4
COVID-19 PCR and antigen testing, shelter-in-place, and social distancing are effective and
complementary public health strategies, but in their patchwork implementation, have not been adequate to
stop ongoing virus transmission. Viral load (number of viral particles) and duration of viral shedding
(where the virus replicates and is released into the environment by an asymptomatic or symptomatic host)
are important determinants for COVID-19 transmission.2,3 Based on current literature, viral shedding of
SARS-CoV-2 may begin 5 to 6 days before the onset of symptoms and then declines 14·6 days to 17·2
days following symptom onset, although in some cases of protracted infection, shedding may continue for
much longer.2,3 In contrast to the etiology of related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, where
symptom onset was rapid and enabled swift isolation procedures, the long asymptomatic contagious
period of COVID-19 adds urgency to the issue of early infection detection to guide testing, treatment, and
isolation policies and reduce spread.
Tracking biometric data from wearable devices is a promising method for detecting COVID-195–9 and
other respiratory viral infections.10 Wearable devices contain a myriad of different sensors that collect
distinct data types such as heart rate, steps, and sleep, which can potentially be used to track viral
infections over time and proactively detect their onset using statistical methods like cumulative sum
(CUSUM), RHR-Diff, and HROS-AD, as in our previous work.5 However, physiological measurements
are often affected by external factors or variables such as environmental conditions (high temperature and
altitude etc.), and this can lead to inherently unpredictable time-series data.11 Detecting anomalies in these
scenarios can be challenging with standard approaches based on statistical measures that use static data or
a pre-specified time-window to detect changes in the underlying distribution or prediction errors.11
Here, we employed a deep learning framework, Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)-based
Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection (LAAD), that learns temporal dependencies from the input data
(baseline or training data) to reconstruct ‘normal’ time-series output, calculate a threshold based on the
reconstruction error from the baseline, and uses it to detect anomalies in the test data.11 LAAD contains an
encoder that learns a vector representation of the input time-series data and a decoder that uses this
representation to reconstruct the baseline data. For the implementation of both the encoder and the
decoder, we use LSTM cells. LSTMs can learn dependencies from one instance to another while solving
the vanishing-gradient problem that affects standard recurrent neural networks.11 This capability is due to
a more complex cell architecture that accurately maintains a memory of important correlations. LAAD’s
ability to learn higher-level temporal patterns without prior knowledge of the pattern duration and its
ability to learn from ‘normal’ data makes it robust to both predictable and unpredictable time-series
data.11

Methods
Datasets
We used publicly shared data from a previously-published Phase-1 study.5 We selected 25 COVIDpositive, 11 non-COVID-19 illness, and 70 healthy individuals with enough data to train, test and
evaluate metrics. It also contains metadata with self-reported symptom dates and diagnosis dates. We
used a sample function from pandas library (https://pandas.pydata.org) to randomly assign a symptom

date for each healthy individual using their test data time intervals with a fixed random seed. For two
COVID positive datasets without symptom dates, we used diagnosis dates as symptom dates.
LAAD framework
Pre-processing. For each user, we selected the heart rate data and merged the step data with the same
exact time-stamp as heart rate. Merged data was aggregated to one-minute resolution using the resample
function from pandas library. Next, the resting heart rate was calculated by selecting the heart rate
intervals where steps were zero for 12 minutes ahead of a given time point. Finally, we used movingaverages (mean = 400 hours) to smooth the time-series data with the rolling function from pandas and
further aggregated to one-hour resolution by taking the mean.
Data splitting and normalization. We labeled the data as infectious, non-infectious and recovery periods
based on general consensus of the recent COVID-19 literature.1–3 Seven days before and 21 days after the
symptom onset were considered as infectious, 10 to 20 days before the infectious period as non-infectious
period and days after infectious period as a recovery period (figure 1A). Using these labels we divided
the data into training data or baseline using the days before the non-infectious period and test data by
taking the days during the non-infectious, infectious period and recovery periods.
Training data is further divided into 95% training and 5% validation data after applying data
augmentation (Methods). Train data and test data were standardized separately and transformed into a
tensor format before feeding them into the LAAD framework. Data was standardized by setting the mean
to zero and variance to one with the help of a standard scaler from sklearn library (https://scikitlearn.org).
Data windowing. We split the RHR sequence and grouped the resulting data using a fixed-length window
(W) of size 8. The value of W defines how many time-lags are processed by the LAAD that classifies the
input as an anomaly or not. Finally, we reshaped the data format to tensor with features: number of
samples (batch size), number of time steps per sample (sequence length), number of features.
Data augmentation. We applied seven time-series data augmentation techniques found in the
literature.12,13 Scaling - changes the magnitude of the data in a window by multiplying by a scalar. The
scalar was determined by a Gaussian distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0·1. Rotations applies arbitrary rotations to the existing data. Permutation - randomly perturbs the temporal location of
within-window events. To perturb the location of the data in a single window, we first slice the data into
N same length segments, with N ranging from 1 to 5, and randomly permute the segments to create a new
window. Magnitude-warping – changes the magnitude of each time series is multiplied by a curve created
by a cubic spline with four knots at random magnitudes with a mean 1 and standard deviation 0·2. Timewarping - perturb the temporal location using a random smooth warping curve generated by a cubic spline
with four knots at random magnitudes with a mean 1 and standard deviation 0·2. Window-warping selects a random window of 10% of the original data and either speed it up by 2 or slows it down by 0:5.
Window-slicing - a window of 90% of the original time series is chosen at random. We created eight
times the size of the baseline data by applying scaling on the baseline data and rotations on scaled data
and so on.
LSTM-based Autoencoder. We used a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder since our data consists of timeseries sequences (figure 1B). The objective was to reconstruct the RHR data using an encoded
representation of the input (baseline) time-series sequences. The autoencoder consists of an encoder and
decoder.11 An LSTM encoder learns a fixed-length vector representation of the input RHR time-series
data and the LSTM decoder uses this representation to reconstruct the RHR time-series using the current
hidden state and the value predicted from the previous time-step. For the implementation of both the
encoder and the decoder, we used LSTM layers, which consider temporal dependencies from one

sequence to another. We trained the autoencoder using the baseline data with baseline RHR temporal
sequences and reconstructed it with a low reconstruction error and then used it to detect anomalies in test
data.
We used Talos (https://github.com/autonomio/talos) to evaluate the algorithm performance by measuring
the reconstruction error with a different set of hyper-parameters and considered the model that gave the
lowest error as best. Early stopping callback was used to avoid overfitting by stopping the training at the
optimal time.
For LAAD, we used 4 LSTM layers: one RepeatVector layer, one TimeDense layer, and 128 hidden
neurons for implementing both the encoder and decoder. The reconstruction error is calculated as an MSE
(Mean Squared Error) and the ADAM algorithm is used to optimize the learning process. We split the
training dataset and used 5% of that data as a validation set for evaluation and monitoring validation loss.
We set a value (maximum value) of reconstruction error from the baseline data as a threshold and
annotated any value in the test data that is greater than this threshold as an anomaly.
Anomaly distance, signal strength
Anomaly distance was calculated by subtracting the date and time of the first anomalous event during the
COVID-19 infectious period from the symptom onset date. Anomaly signal strength was calculated by
dividing the number of anomalous events in a pre-symptomatic window (7 days before the symptom
onset) with the loss calculated by mean square error (MSE) and further divided by the length of the
window (7 days) and multiplied by 100. In post-symptomatic cases, 21 days after the symptom onset and
21 days window length were used. Cases that have more than 6 anomaly signal strength scores were
grouped as strong and those with less than 6 were grouped as weak.
Number of abnormal RHR hours, delta abnormal RHR
For each user, a number of abnormal RHR hours were counted during COVID-19 infectious period. For
each user, delta RHR was calculated by subtracting the total RHR of the anomalies in test data (COVID19 infectious period) from baseline/training data. Delta RHR was further grouped as elevated if the RHR
was positive and lowered if the RHR was negative.
Performance evaluation
True positives (TP) are the number of anomalous RHR hours that are correctly identified as anomalous.
False positives (FP) are the number of normal hours that are incorrectly identified as anomalous. True
negatives (TN) are the number of normal hours that are correctly identified as normal. False negatives
(FN) are the number of anomalous hours that are incorrectly identified as normal. We calculated the
performance metrics as follows: precision-recall, where precision is defined as the ratio between true
positives and the sum between true positives and false positives (Precision = TP / (TP + FP)) and recall
(also known as sensitivity or true-positive rate) is defined as the ratio between the true positives and the
sum between true positives and false negatives (Recall = TP / (TP + FN)). Precision measures the
proportion of anomalous hours that are relevant and recall measures of how many hours are anomalous.
Furthermore, we calculated the F-beta score, a weighted mean of both precision and recall. The F-beta
score is a generalization of the F-score that adds a configuration parameter called beta. A default beta
value is 1·0, which is the same as the F-score. We used a beta value, such as 0·1, that gives more weight
to precision and less to recall, assuming false positives are more important to minimize, but false
negatives are still important (F-beta = ((1 + beta2) x Precision x Recall) / (beta2 x Precision + Recall)).

Results
We collected heart rate and steps wearable data from 106 individuals, including 25 COVID-19+, 11 nonCOVID-19 illness with self-reported symptoms, and 70 healthy individuals with no symptoms or illness
(table 1; appendix 2 pp 1) during the COVID-19 period (February 2020 until June 2020) to examine
whether there is any consistent anomalous signal during the COVID-19 infectious period (defined as 7
days prior and 21 days after symptom onset) (figure 1A). Before applying the deep learning framework,
we inferred resting heart rate (RHR) from heart rate and steps data and then aggregated resulting RHR
data to one-hour resolution. We defined the anomalous signal or abnormal RHR based on its deviations
(either elevated or lowered) from the baseline (figure 1A). We then divided the wearable data into
baseline or training data using the days before the non-infectious period and test data using the days
during the non-infectious and the infectious period (figure 1A; appendix 2 pp 2). Next, we transformed
univariate RHR data into sub-sequences by combining time steps contiguous data values using a data
windowing method.
Deep learning models typically require large datasets for training. Otherwise, the model is prone to
overfitting. In our case, we only have a limited number of days available for training (appendix 2 pp 2).
Augmented data can cover unexplored input space, prevent overfitting, and improve the generalization
ability of a deep learning model.12,13 To do this, we applied different data augmentation techniques12,13 on
our limited training data by transforming each user’s training data into approximately eight times the size.
Next, we built an LAAD model that takes input with a specific shape (batch size, sequence length,
number of features) and learns the structure by reconstructing an output of the same shape (figure 1B).
We used augmented training data as the input to the LAAD model. We further split training data into 95%
training and 5% validation sets and used these to train the LAAD model. To get optimal performance, we
used tuned hyper-parameters (hidden layers = 6, number of neurons = 128, batch size = 64, number of
epochs = 1200 with early stopping callbacks, learning rate = 0·0001, optimizer = adam). Using a
reconstruction loss technique, mean square error (MSE), we built a threshold where, if the MSE for a test
sample is greater than this threshold, that sample is labeled as an anomaly or abnormal RHR (appendix 1
pp 4,5; appendix 2 pp 3-5).
Using LAAD and data from the COVID-19 patients, we detected an abnormal RHR signal in 14
individuals during pre-symptomatic (early), in 9 individuals during post-symptomatic periods (late), and
failed to detect a signal in two individuals (missed) (figure 2A; appendix 1 pp 6, appendix 2 pp 6). As
an example, in the COVID-19 positive individual, ASFODQR, the anomaly score representing the level
of abnormal RHR starts before symptom onset and increases during the COVID-19 infectious period as
compared to the baseline, non-infectious or recovery periods (figure 2B). Abnormal RHR starts 5·04 days
before symptom onset, comprising 6·94 days early in pre-symptomatic cases and 1·92 days late in the
post-symptomatic cases (figure 2C; appendix 2 pp 6). Of 14 pre-symptomatic cases, 7 had strong and 7
had weak abnormal RHR signals during the pre-symptomatic period, and of the 9 post-symptomatic
cases, 4 had strong and 5 had weak abnormal RHR signals during the post-symptomatic period

(figure2A; appendix 2 pp 6). This indicates that not all COVID-19 positive individuals have similar
levels of abnormal RHR and also suggests that LAAD can successfully detect cases where the signal is
not strong.
To measure the performance of this model, we further divided test data into a) test-normal by analyzing
the days during the non-infectious period and b) test-anomaly by examining the infectious period, and
evaluated predictions against each other (figure 1A; table 1; appendix 2 pp 2). On average, the anomaly
detection model had a precision of 0·91 (SD 0·13, 95% CI 0·854–0·967), a recall of 0·36 (0·295, 0·232–
0·487), and a F-beta score of 0·79 (0·226, 0·693–0·888) (appendix 2 pp 9). Precision, P, was defined as
the ratio between true positives, TP (the number of samples or RHR hours belonging to the anomaly class
that are correctly classified as anomalous) and the sum of TP and false positives, FP, where FP represents
the number of samples belonging to the normal class that are incorrectly classified as anomalous. Recall,
R, was defined as the ratio between the TP and the sum of TPs and false negatives FN, which are the
number of samples belonging to the anomaly class that are incorrectly classified as normal. Finally, the Fbeta score is defined as the weighted mean of P and R. This allows a model to be evaluated by using a
single score that accounts for both precision and recall performance.
Next, we investigated 11 non-COVID-19 individuals and found abnormal RHR signals in seven
individuals during the pre-symptomatic period and two individuals during the post-symptomatic period
but failed to detect a signal in two individuals (appendix 1 pp 1; appendix 2 pp 4,7). On average, the
anomaly detection model had a precision of 0·803 (0·262, 0·602–1), a recall of 0·472 (0·405, 0·16–
0·783), and an F-beta score of 0·771 (0·252, 0·577–0·965) (appendix 2 pp 10). We further investigated
70 healthy individuals by randomly assigning a symptom date for the test data and detected abnormal
RHR signal in 44 individuals during the randomly selected pre-symptomatic period and 15 individuals
during the randomly selected post-symptomatic period and failed to detect a signal in 11 individuals
(appendix 1 pp 2; appendix 2 pp 5,8). On average, the anomaly detection model had a precision of
0·803 (0·262, 0·726–0·88), a recall of 0·289 (0·336, 0·19–0·387), and a F-beta score of 0·703 (0·259,
0·627–0·78) (appendix 2 pp 9-11). Overall, LAAD performed well across all three groups with an
average F-beta score of 0·75 (SD 0.04) (figure 2D).
COVID-19+ cases showed longer hours of abnormal RHR (89 hours or 3·7 days) during the infectious
period as compared to non-COVID-19 (87·5 hours, 3·65 days) and healthy (25 hours, 1·04 days) cases,
suggesting that COVID-19 infection lasts longer than anomalous periods for healthy cases and slightly
longer than other types of infections (figure 2E; appendix 1 pp 3; appendix 2 pp 12). In total, 78·3%
(18 of 23 cases) of COVID-19+ cases had more than one day of abnormal RHR signal compared to 70%
(7 of 10 cases) of non-COVID19 and 51·56% (33 of 64 cases) of healthy cases (appendix 1 pp 3). These
results suggest that the duration of abnormal RHR can predict COVID-19 and discriminate from healthy
cases but not from non-COVID-19 cases. Abnormal RHR levels during the infectious period were
elevated by 5·1 days and lowered by 3·9 days compared to the baseline (Delta RHR) (figure 2F;
appendix 1 pp 3; appendix 2 pp 13). In non-COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals, abnormal RHR
was elevated for 4·1 days and 6·4 days and lowered by 5·7 days and 6·5 days, respectively (figure 2F;
appendix 2 pp 13). These results suggest that the levels of abnormal RHR can predict COVID-19 but
cannot discriminate from non-COVID-19 cases and healthy cases.

Discussion
We demonstrate that deep learning can identify periods of COVID-19 and is more sensitive than
approaches used in other previously reported studies.5,10 However, our study has several limitations.
First, all symptom onset dates were self-reported by the patients, usually after diagnostic confirmation of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.21249474; this version posted January 9, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

COVID-19. Since the data was divided into training and test sets and all metrics calculations were based
on the self-reported symptom onset date, errors in self-reporting can introduce bias in our results and
model performance. Second, we divided the symptomatic period into pre-symptomatic and postsymptomatic periods using recent studies on the viral infectiousness period. However, the length of these
periods could vary substantially from one patient to another and thus introduce bias in our results. Third,
none of the healthy patients had COVID-19 tests, and it is therefore possible that some of them had
asymptomatic infections. Indeed, we found 11 healthy cases where abnormal RHR was detected for 3·7
days (89 hours) more during the infectious period, similar to COVID-19 patients (appendix 2 pp 12).
Fourth, on average only approximately 3 months of data was collected per user and thus deriving training,
validation and test data from such limited data may be a limiting factor for the model performance. Fifth,
we did not test any confirmed COVID19 negative cases, which limits the potential of our study. Sixth,
only 25 COVID-19 cases were used in the analysis. Adding more samples will improve our
understanding of wearable data performance in detecting COVID-19. Seventh, all data used in this study
were collected from Fitbit smartwatch heart rate and activity data. Adding other data types like
temperature, saturated oxygen, sleep, and data from other devices such as the Apple watch or Garmin
watch could potentially improve COVID-19 detection. Eighth, choosing a correct baseline with enough
data size to train the model has a major impact on predictions. For example, A7EM0B6 with only 4 days
of training data showed severe underfitting of the model (appendix 2 pp 4). Ninth, sleep data was
inconsistent and not the same resolution as heart rate and activity data, which limited the inclusion of
sleep data in our model. Tenth, no cross-validation was performed to test the performance of the deep
learning model on unseen datasets. Testing new COVID-19+ patients data with LAAD could validate and
potentially improve the model. Finally, this deep learning framework uses retrospective data and is
designed as a proof-of-concept. It has yet to be tested in a prospective real-time fashion using preannotated labels from users.
Overall, our work suggests that wearable sensor data could be used as a marker for early prediction of
COVID-19. This study also greatly extends our previous phase-1 study5 and factors unpredictable
behavior and time-series nature of the data, limited data size, and lack of data labels to evaluate
performance metrics. A detailed real-time wearable study on the COVID-19 patients with symptoms
annotated by users and confirmed by laboratory tests will further our understanding about tracking,
modeling, and detecting outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1 Data design and LAAD framework (LSTM Encoder-Decoder inference steps for input to
reconstruct the output). (A) To detect abnormal RHR (resting heart rate) data was split into baseline (train) and
test sign symptom onset day as a reference. First, test data was set by taking 20 days prior to symptom onset and 21
days after. Second, test data was split into infectious period (7 days prior symptom onset and 21 days after) and noninfectious period (20 to 10 days before infectious period), and recovery period (days after infectious period). If the
RHR during the infectious period is changed (elevated or lowered) from its user’s baseline, it would be classified as
“abnormal RHR”. Further, to evaluate the model performance, predictions in the infectious period were compared
against the non-infectious period. (B) LAAD takes baseline standardized RHR data of shape (BS, SL, NF), where BS
is batch size, NF is the number of features and SL is sequence length or time steps and passes it to the first layer. The
input data has 8 timesteps and one feature. First layer has as many LSTM cells as the SL and makes each cell per
timestep emit a signal to a second layer. Layer 1, LSTM(128), reads the input data and outputs 128 features with 8
timesteps. Second layer has half the size of LSTM cells than the previous and only the last cell emits an output.
Layer 2, LSTM(64), takes the 8x128 input from Layer 1 and reduces the feature size to 64. The output of this layer
is the encoded feature vector of the input data. Third layer uses a Repeat Vector that replicates the feature vector 3

times and gets a 2D array for the fourth layer (1st LSTM layer in Decoder) and acts as a bridge between encoder and
decoder. The decoder layers unfold the encoding by stacking LSTM layers in the. reverse order of the encoder.
Layer 4, LSTM (64), and Layer 5, LSTM (128), are the mirror images of Layer 2 and Layer 1, respectively. Layer 6,
TimeDistributed (Dense(1)), is added in the end to get the reconstructed output, where “1” is the number of features
in the input data.

RHR between COVID-19, healthy and non-COVID-19 groups. (A) On the left, bar plots showing anomaly
scores obtained from reconstruction error or mean squared error (MSE) and timings of infection detection from the
LAAD model with respect to the different periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection for COVID-19+ participants. Based on
the time of detection, participants were grouped into early and late groups. Based on anomaly signal strength, these
groups were further sub-grouped into strong and weak. Participants were ordered based on early and strong to weak
and late grouping order. One participant, whose LAAD failed to detect anomaly during infectious period was
annotated as “missed”. The x-axis shows days before, during and after the infection and the y axis shows loss values
from LAAD (green bars). On the right, a table showing performance metrics (TP - true positives, FP - false

Figure S.6- LAAD predictions in COVID-19+ patients (normal – blue, anomaly – red). The red dotted line is the
symptom onset date, gold line represents the pre-symptomatic window (7 days before symptom onset) and purple
line represents the post-symptomatic window (21 days after symptom onset), and the grey horizontal dotted line
represents the selected threshold.

Section 5 - Supplemental Table 5. Anomalies predicted by LAAD in healthy participants.
Section 6 - Supplemental Table 6. COVID-19 patients grouped into early, late depending on time of detection and
number of anomalies (signal), strong and weak groups depending on signal strength during the infectious period.
Section 7 - Supplemental Table 7. Non-COVID-19 participants grouped into early, late depending on the time of
detection and number of anomalies (signal), strong and weak groups depending on signal strength during the
infectious period.
Section 8 - Supplemental Table 8. Healthy participants grouped into early, late depending on time of detection and
number of anomalies (signal), strong and weak groups depending on signal strength during infectious periods.
Section 9 - Supplemental Table 9. Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F-beta score) in COVID-19 patients.
Section 10 - Supplemental Table 10. Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F-beta score) in non-COVID-19
participants.
Section 11 - Supplemental Table 11. Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F-beta score) in healthy participants.
Section 12 - Supplemental Table 12. Duration of the abnormal RHR during infectious period in COVID-19
patients, non-COVID-19 and healthy participants. 11 users listed as possible asymptomatic based on more than 89
hours of abnormal RHR during the infectious period.
Section 13 - Supplemental Table 13. Delta RHR (the median difference between abnormal RHR from the
infectious period and RHR from baseline) in COVID-19 patients, non-COVID-19 and healthy participants. TRUE in
the positive column indicates increased RHR and FALSE indicates lowered RHR.
