Italy is currently experiencing an epidemic of COVID-19 which emerged in the
Lombardy region 1. During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of
COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which
were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a
traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria,
Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route
of introduction2.

We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index
of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA)
for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used
the methods of Fraser et al3 to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in
order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of
COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are
non-residents of Italy (63%)4 and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days)5, and
assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020 6.
We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries
regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the
relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries
and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel.
When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI
2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting nonidentification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552
to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases) (Table).
We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a
far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this
difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran7. In summary,
we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an
epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par
