ABSTRACT
Introduction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life
and programs and services that promote and protect early childhood development. Global
stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and
other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of
young children and therefore likely impacting children's development.
Methodology. This rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young
children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive
search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30
countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely:
responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and children's safety and security.
Results. There are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families,
including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies' findings
reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties
and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited
opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect
and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote
learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education.
Conclusion. The findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased
support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected
during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for action-oriented implementation
studies – those that go beyond identifying trends and begin to pinpoint "what works" to

pandemic.

Key questions
What is already known?
The most fundamental promotive experiences in the early years of life to reach optimal
development come from nurturing care and protection received from parents, family, and
community, which have lifelong benefits including improved health and wellbeing. Health
and other emergencies are detrimental to the provision of nurturing care.
What are the new findings?
Findings from this rapid review reveal numerous areas of concern, including families
reporting mental health difficulties and less responsive parent-child relationships, increased
screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for
responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. As with other features of this
pandemic, not all families are affected equally: financially vulnerable families are much more
likely to experience negative ramifications. The pandemic is also disproportionately affecting
parents and other caregivers with young children, particularly mothers, those with pre-existing
mental health difficulties, and those caring for children with disabilities.
What do the new findings imply?
Findings highlight the need for action by governments, civil society, international and
community-based organizations to improve support for families so that the pandemic does not
break the provision of nurturing care and wipe out decades of progress, especially for
vulnerable families and children.

INTRODUCTION
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in family life on every
continent. There have been prolonged containment measures in many countries, with second
waves and renewed lockdowns. Families are "locked in" together, without access to their usual
forms of social support and with disruptions to services and programmes that protect and
promote early childhood development (i.e., childcare, early childhood education, parenting
programmes, health services). Global stakeholders have raised concerns that essential
components of 'nurturing care' for early childhood development have been harmed during the
pandemic [1,2]. The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and World Bank Group
advocate that young children require five inter-related components of nurturing care for optimal
development and well-being: good health, adequate nutrition, a family environment rich in
responsive caregiving, opportunities for formal and informal early learning, and protection from
safety risks and maltreatment [3]. During the first years of life, parents, intimate family members
and caregivers are the closest to the young child and thus the best providers of nurturing care.
This is why secure family environments are important for young children. In order to provide
caregivers with time and resources to provide nurturing care, multisectoral policies, services and
community supports need to be in place. Health, nutrition, education, social welfare, and child
protection all have a role to play in creating an enabling environment for nurturing care (for
further details, see https://nurturing-care.org).
Evidence shows that epidemics and pandemics are associated with disruptions to nurturing
care and child development, stemming from increased caregiver social isolation and stress [4],
disruption to family routines [5], traumatic stress among caregivers [6], household conflict and
anxiety [7], early termination of breastfeeding [8], and reduced play among children and

engagement in team-based sports [9]. This rapid review aimed to capture the emerging evidence
on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on three components of nurturing care: responsive
caregiving, early learning opportunities, and child safety and protection from violence and
neglect. This is a broad inquiry that is explored through different outcomes that are critical for
nurturing care and child development. For responsive caregiving, it includes good mental health
of parents and caregivers, warm and responsive parent-child relationships, breastfeeding support
(to promote emotional bonds and attachment), and fathers’ engagement in caregiving. For early
learning, it includes access to formal and home-based learning, parent–child reading and other
early learning activities, and safe play spaces. For children's safety and security, it includes
protecting children against injury, neglect and abuse, including child protection and referral
services for suspected maltreatment. This review did not examine child health and nutrition, the
other components of nurturing care, due to ongoing work and recently published reviews in these
areas. The review findings can help identify and conceptualize priority issues for early years’
policy and programming during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and identify the
literature gaps where future studies are required.

METHODS
To generate evidence in a short time, we employed abbreviated systematic review methods. A
single reviewer completed the study selection and data extraction with verification by a second
reviewer, and we omitted quality assessments of the included studies. The population of interest
is young children (birth to 8 years old) and their caregivers, including birth parents, adoptive
parents, and formal caregivers. Studies involving children up to 18 years old and their caregivers
are included as long as the studies also included results for children under 8 years old. Published

quantitative or qualitative studies that document their full methodology are included, and
preprints and the grey literature to ensure representativeness and due to the rapidly evolving
nature of COVID-19 pandemic impact evidence.
We focused on studies that reported on responsive caregiving during the COVID-19
pandemic (e.g., parental mental health, caregiver stress, parent–child interactions, family
functioning, fathers' engagement in caregiving, gender roles and norms, breastfeeding, skin-toskin contact, social support). We also included studies that reported on opportunities for early
learning during the pandemic (e.g., access to formal and home-based learning, parent–child
reading and other early learning activities, outdoor play, physical activity, screen time, sedentary
behaviour). Lastly, we included studies that reported on children's safety and security during the
pandemic (e.g., child injuries, child maltreatment referrals, child physical or psychological
abuse, family violence). We searched two databases (PubMed and ERIC) based on a search
strategy developed and pilot-tested in collaboration with a librarian. Also, for the grey literature,
the review team manually searched the websites of more than 80 multilateral and bilateral
organizations, internal NGOs, foundations, and so forth. Lastly, we screened the reference lists
of the included studies for further relevant citations. We restricted the search to papers available
in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. Studies were published between 1 January 2020
and 25 October 2020.
Identified records were exported and managed on Zotero. After removing duplicates, the
titles and abstracts of the remaining records were screened against the eligibility criteria,
followed by full-text screening. We extracted data from the studies using a standardized form,
with a second reviewer assessing for completeness and accuracy. Data extracted included, but
was not limited to, investigators/authors, year of publication, setting, context, details of the

methods and data collection, participants, outcomes, results, and conclusions. Data extraction
was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
checklist items. The preliminary stages of the synthesis involved organizing the extracted data
through itemizing the data into thematic areas and tabulating the results to systematically identify
patterns within and between studies and variations across studies. Because of the heterogeneity
of the available primary studies, we synthesized the results narratively in the report.

RESULTS
After excluding duplicates, the initial search yielded 4210 papers from the database search and
86 publications through the organizational website search. After the title, abstract and full-text
review, 112 publications were included in the review. The PRISMA flow diagram in Figure 1
provides an overview of the study selection process.

While most studies (89) in the review focus on high-income countries, there is increasing
geographic diversity from low- and middle-income countries (23). In terms of the thematic areas,
the largest number of papers focused predominantly on issues related to 'responsive caregiving'
(59), which points towards increased parent and other caregiver stress, burnout, depression and
anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, and harsher parenting and less warm or responsive
parenting. Evidence suggests increased fathers’ engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. On
the other hand, evidence indicates that COVID-19 restrictions have hampered access to
traditional lactation support services. The next largest number of studies examined issues related
to 'safety and security' (35), which point towards drop in child abuse and neglect referrals to
child protection services, and a reduction in emergency department visits for child injuries.
Lastly, a relatively small number of studies addressed opportunities for early learning and play
during the COVID-19 pandemic (18). These studies point towards increased screen time among
children, and a reduction in outdoor play and physical activities. Evidence is limited on homebased learning for young children (age 3-5 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic. What is
available suggests challenges, frustrations and inequitable access to distance learning for the
youngest learners. Results include 95 quantitative studies (primarily cross-sectional due to the
nature of the pandemic), nine qualitative studies, and eight mixed methods designs. Key findings
of included studies are synthesized in the following sections, and a summary of each study can
be found in the complementary table.

Figure 1. Key review findings on nurturing care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Parent and caregiver stress, mental health, and responsive caregiving
The review results indicate that parents' and other caregivers' mental health has been among the
most researched topics related to nurturing care during the pandemic. During the period under
review, more than 30 studies across various geographic and demographic contexts examined the
implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on parent and caregiver stress, burnout, depression, and
anxiety [10–45]. The presented evidence indicates that the pandemic crisis has been detrimental
to caregiver stress and mental health, particularly for parents and other caregivers of young
children and mothers [14,16,30,31,33], being single [30], economically vulnerable families
[14,27,42], and those with pre-existing mental health issues [14,42]. Parents and other caregivers

of children with disabilities also showed a heightened prevalence of depressive symptoms,
anxiety, and stress during the pandemic [11,18,43].
While this evidence base is heterogeneous, with variations in the data, context, and
methodology, the findings are generally consistent in revealing that the pandemic and its related
policy response measures drive increases in caregiver stress and poor mental health. For
example, a study of 192 Italian mothers found that 29% of mothers who had given birth during
the COVID-19 lockdown had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) global score
above the cut-off score of >12, compared to only 12% in the control group who had given birth
during the same period the year before COVID-19 [45]. A study of 651 Finnish parents of
children (aged 5 to 8 years old) found that 26% met the clinical EPDS cut-off score for potential
depression during the pandemic, compared to 15% among the same sample parents with data
collected between 2014 and 2019 [33].
While the literature identified multiple and often overlapping COVID-19-related stressors
that adversely affected the mental health of parents and other caregivers of children, economic
insecurity stands out as one of the strongest and most consistent sources of parent and caregiver
stress [12,24,25,28,42,46–49]. For example, using data from 2,174 Bangladeshi mothers with
children aged 0–5 years old, Hamadani et al. [25] found that 96% of respondents experienced a
reduction in paid work during a COVID-19 lockdown, with average monthly family income
falling from US$212 to US$59, and food insecurity increasing by more than 50%. Self-reported
maternal depressive symptoms, as measured by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression
Scale (CESD-D), significantly increased during the lockdown period compared to before the
pandemic; and nearly 70% of the sample reported that their anxiety had risen during the
lockdown. A US study of 561 parents and other caregivers of young children (aged 2–7 years

old) and who were hourly workers found that the majority of respondents reported a loss of
household income (69%) and even job loss (60%), which linked with increased anxiety,
depression, anger, and irritability, as well as worse sleep quality [24].
Numerous studies found that parent and caregiver stress, depression, and anxiety during
the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with reduced responsive caregiving, including, for
example, lower parent–child closeness and more avoidant or harsher parenting attitudes and
behaviours [10,13,16,27,28,32,37,38,41,42,48]. A New Zealand study found that parents of
young children (aged 4–5 years old) who experienced more significant depressive symptoms and
perceived stress during a COVID-19 lockdown reported harsher parenting and less
warm/responsive parenting, as measured by the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire
(PSDQ); and parent–child relationships were also of lower quality [32]. A US study of lowincome families with preschool-age children found that parental job loss and income loss during
the pandemic were strongly associated with parents' depressive symptoms, stress, diminished
sense of hope, and negative parent–child interactions, including losing their temper or yelling at
their child [27]. However, parents who lost their job but did not experience corresponding
household income decline, perhaps due to economic stimulus relief for low-income families,
were more likely to report enjoying spending time with their child during the COVID-19
pandemic and engaging in positive parent-child interactions, such as playing with or hugging
their child, compared to those who experienced a decline in household income. These results
suggest that efforts to ensure economic security may help address parents' and other caregivers'
mental health needs and reduce adverse parenting risk. Studies also noted more couple conflict
[50] and increased substance use [51] among parents and caregivers experiencing stress and
anxiety during the pandemic.

Few studies to date have discussed potential interventions to support parents and other
caregivers with COVID-19-related stress, anxiety, and mental health issues or ways to protect
parents' capacity for responsive caregiving during the crisis. One study found mothers rarely
utilized mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic due to various barriers, such as a
lack of time or energy, cost of service, not believing they needed such services, and uncertainty
on access [14]. Studies found that partner support and cooperative co-parenting [13,14,20,32]
and moderate physical exercise [17,29] were associated with better mental health and coping
among parents and caregivers during the pandemic. Thus pandemic-related strategies for parents
and caregivers could focus on supportive parenting interventions and home or internet-based
exercise interventions. Lastly, a few studies point towards mixed and potentially positive
impacts of the COVID-19 restrictions on deepening family ties, improving couples' relationships,
and developing new family hobbies or activities [13,22,46,52–54]. However, such positive
benefits were typically found among the parents and caregivers of older children or adolescents
and among families with several protective factors, including financial stability, comfortable and
safe homes, enough food to eat, good health, and healthy couple relationships [22,46].
Breastfeeding support during COVID-19
Breastfeeding not only provides an infant with nutrition, but it is also a process of responsive
caregiving in which the mother and her young child interact closely in a safe and secure
relationship. Five studies related to breastfeeding support during the pandemic indicate that
lockdowns resulted in reduced breastfeeding support and care [55–59]. For example, over a
quarter of respondents in a national U.K. study struggled to access breastfeeding support during
the pandemic, and some stopped breastfeeding before they intended to [55]. Among the women
who stopped breastfeeding during the pandemic, the most common reason was the lack of

13

breastfeeding support and face-to-face help with practical problems, such as latching. Some
valued the virtual health appointments among the women who had to shift from face-to-face
lactation support to digital consultations. In contrast, others reported feeling violated during this
impersonal interaction, describing how they felt discomfort recording their infant trying to latch
onto the breast [59]. During the pandemic, some breastfeeding women reported some positive
benefits, including having more time to focus on breastfeeding and responsive feeding, with
fewer visitors, more, privacy and more significant breastfeeding support from fathers [58].
Fathers' engagement in childcare and gendered employment patterns
The evidence suggests that increases in fathers' time at home during COVID-19 have reduced
gender gaps in childcare division, which may have promoted positive changes to family
dynamics and more similar caregiving arrangements. In total, eight studies reported that fathers
took on more childcare responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic [60–67]. For example, a
survey of 1,536 Australian parents of children (aged 0–16 years old) reported that fathers
averaged 2.21 daily hours on active childcare before the pandemic, and this average increased to
3.64 hours during the pandemic, thereby narrowing the childcare gap between mothers and
fathers [62]. However, mothers continued to carry the burden of extra childcare and household
responsibilities during the pandemic [68], and gendered employment patterns were exacerbated
[60,67,69–71]. In particular, mothers were more likely than fathers to lose their jobs during the
crisis, spend less time on paid work, and be interrupted during work hours, principally by
childcare [1]. There is an absence of studies examining how parents and other caregivers of
young children, including infants and toddlers, negotiate childcare responsibilities and household
work during crises. There was also a lack of studies discussing male caregivers' perspectives and

experiences of caregiving during the pandemic and quality of interaction and exploring
caregiving responsibilities and arrangements of single parents.
Opportunities for early learning during COVID-19
Evidence on home-based early learning during the COVID-19 pandemic is limited compared to
the other thematic areas in the review. What is available indicates that many children in early
childhood education did not have contact with teachers or access to remote early learning during
school closure [66,72,73]. For example, a study of Ethiopian parents and caregivers of young
children found that only 10% of children who enrolled in pre-primary had been in contact with
teachers or school principals, with significant differences found by household wealth and across
regions [73].In this study, half of parents and caregivers reported supporting educational or
learning activities for pre-primary children, including 12% who had used radio lessons while
schools were closed. Children living in rural or remote areas had significant disadvantages
regarding access to electricity, technologies, and children's books or learning materials.
Other studies provide evidence of frustration and negative attitudes among caregivers
about distance learning benefits and values, especially for preschool-aged children [74–76].
Home-based learning has been challenging for young children for various reasons, including
limited learning materials and technological barriers [77,78]. Children who were looked after by
grandparents faced challenges due to their limited awareness about online technologies [77].
Parents noted concerns about lack of social interaction, sedentary behaviour, and limited physical
activity during school closures [21,79,80]. A study of parents of children (aged 2-4 years)
reported that almost half of the children spent no time playing with another child in their
household during lockdowns [21]. Evidence is limited and mixed on the nature and extent of
caregiver engagement in adult-child reading, playful parenting, and other early learning activities

during the lockdown. Some studies find that parents engaged more in such activities during the
lockdown [66,73] while others reported they engaged less than before the pandemic [72]. Parents
who met the criteria for probable major or severe depression and parenting stress were negatively
associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home [79].
Children's play and physical activity during COVID-19
Nine studies reported that COVID-19 restrictions, such as the closure of schools and
playgrounds, the cancellation of sports and activity classes, and reduced social interactions with
peers, were linked to reduced outdoor play and physical activity and more sedentary behaviour
among children [72,81–88]. One study found that nearly 9 out of 10 Canadian parents reported
increased screen time since the beginning of the pandemic among young children aged 18
months old to 5 years old [81]. More than half of the parents in this study reported that children's
physical activity decreased during the pandemic, citing challenges due to the lack of indoor
space and the variety of available toys. Another study found a dramatic decline in children's
outdoor physical activity and much higher screen time use (average of 5 hrs/day) during the
initial period of the COVID-19 outbreak, compared with before the restrictions [83]. Play
indoors did not seem to replace active play outdoors, resulting in a net decline in children's playbased activities. Cities and areas with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, and thus most
stringent restrictions, had the most significant drop in children's outdoor play [84]. Living in
houses (as opposed to apartments) was correlated with increased outdoor activities [86].
Child protection from violence and neglect during COVID-19
In terms of children's safety and security, evidence indicates that COVID-19 has reduced child
maltreatment referrals. Thirteen studies across seven countries, mostly utilizing publicly
available administrative data, suggest that referrals of potential abuse, neglect, and maltreatment

16

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.10.21251507; this version posted February 16, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

to child protective services were substantially lower during the COVID-19 pandemic than before
quarantine measures were put in place [89–101]. Surveys of child protection workers similarly
reported decreased referrals and more difficulty identifying children and families in need during
lockdown [99,102,103]. For example, a study based on data from January 2015 to May 2020 for
New York City's Administration for Children's Services reports there were 29% fewer
allegations of child maltreatment for March 2020—when school closures first began— compared
to previous years [96]. Substantially fewer allegations of child maltreatment were reported by
education personnel and other mandated reporters, including childcare personnel and medical
health personnel during this time. Non-mandated reporters, including family members and
neighbours, also made fewer referrals, which may be linked to social distancing and limited
contact between children and those outside their households. Bullinger et al. (2020a, 2020b)
found that in Chicago and Georgia in the United States, emergency calls for domestic crimes
rose in March and April 2020 but calls for potential child abuse fell, potentially due to the
lessened visibility of child victims than adults.
These changes do not reflect an actual reduction in the incidence or prevalence of maltreatment.
The decrease in referrals is likely due to the given lockdown measures that preclude children
from having regular contact with educators and other mandated reporters. Although many school
districts have transitioned to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence suggests
that educators typically receive inadequate education related to recognizing and responding to
child maltreatment. Virtual formats for teaching do not lend themselves readily to the
identification of child maltreatment. With reduced exposure to schools and other social services,
there is widespread concern that child maltreatment victims are going undetected.

Two studies indicate a striking rise in child abuse-related injuries among babies and
toddlers during the pandemic [104,105]. Comparing cases of children's head trauma caused by
suspected abuse, there were 10 cases at an urban medical facility in the United Kingdom over the
March–April 2020 period, representing an increase of 1493% compared to the previous three
years preceding the lockdown [105]. Although alarming, it is important to consider that COVID19 has led to significant healthcare delivery changes, and many centres have diverted nonCOVID-related health emergencies to specific healthcare facilities, which may account for the
increases in abuse head trauma at particular institutions. One additional study examined the
association between COVID-19 and potential child abuse and found that COVID-19 job loss
among parents and caregivers was significantly associated with psychological maltreatment,
including verbal threats, belittling, and ridiculing, with larger effects for younger children [106].
Given previous evidence detailing the strong links between caregiver stress and the risk of child
maltreatment, the economic-related impacts of COVID-19 may contribute to elevated rates of
child maltreatment; however, this relationship has not yet been substantiated.
Child injuries during COVID-19
Data on emergency department visits and injuries suggest that children's environments have
shifted during the pandemic and present different child safety threats. Nine studies from eight
countries reported a significant reduction in emergency department presentations and operations
for injuries among children during government-imposed lockdown restrictions, especially related
to admissions and operations for sporting-related injuries and those that occur on playgrounds
bans on sports and access to playgrounds [107–115]. For example, a study based on data from a
large acute paediatric hospital in London, UK, found that the prevalence of referrals for child
injuries was reduced by nearly two-thirds during the lockdown from 17 March to 28 April 2020,

compared to in the same period in 2019 [111]. In contrast, some centres found a relative increase
in injuries, including bicycle injuries [107,109], burn injuries [116], ingestions and poisonings
[108], and electrical injuries [114]. The higher incidence of child burn injuries during COVID-19
lockdown was equivalent to the percentage of admissions during a typical summer break and
suggests that child supervision may be a significant factor during school closures [116]. The
general demographic of those presenting with injuries also changed during the pandemic
compared to before the pandemic, with a significantly younger median age [111,113,115].
Parents and other caregivers may have treated more minor injuries at home or, in some cases,
may have avoided seeking medical attention due to the concern of contracting COVID-19 in
hospital facilities. Physical distancing measures, including a ban on sports and children's use of
playgrounds during lockdowns, is likely linked to the overall reduction in child injuries seen
through emergency room admissions. At the same time, there may have also been a shift in careseeking behaviour, with parents and caregivers being more anxious about attending hospital due
to the risk to themselves and the child of contracting COVID-19.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Emerging evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly drawn from parents and other
caregivers' surveys, shows striking similarities in how essential components of nurturing care –
responsive caregiving, support for young children's learning, and children’s safety and security have been disrupted. While there are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the
pandemic on families, such as increased involvement in caregiving among fathers, more
commonly, the studies' findings reveal issues of concern, with parent and caregiver mental health
difficulties and strained parent–child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited

opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect
and maltreatment. As with many other features of this pandemic, not all families are affected
equally. Those with salaried jobs are far less likely to experience income loss than those with
informal, daily wage jobs. Social safety nets such as stimulus packages for families may reduce
parenting stress brought about by COVID-19-related economic hardship and reduce the risk of
harsh and non-responsive parenting. The pandemic is disproportionately affecting parents and
other caregivers with pre-existing mental health conditions and caregivers of children with
disabilities. Families with young children, particularly mothers, may be disproportionately
affected by childcare and school closures, the reduced ability to undertake paid work, and
increased caregiving demands.
Based on these findings, we suggest policy and programme responses for action by governments,
civil society, international and community-based organizations (see Box 1). All of these options
should be pursued vigorously and simultaneously so that the pandemic does not break the
continuity nor lower the quality of provision of nurturing care and wipe out decades of progress,
especially for low-income families and children. These approaches must be coordinated across
sectors and aligned with practical social safety support to families and other caregivers of young
children who experience socioeconomic hardship.

Box 1: Key programme and policy implications
1. Scale-up of social protection mechanisms to ensure families can meet their basic
income needs and food and housing security. Governments should reflect on, and
rebalance, expenditures going to families and children. Supporting parent and
caregiver mental health and minimizing family stress should continue to be a top
priority in COVID-19 response plans and prevention-based approaches. There remains
a huge unmet need to expand and diversify social protection responses, including the
immediate delivery of food packages, longer-term paid parental leave, accessible
childcare, universal basic income, and waivers for utility bills and rent or mortgage
payments, to avoid further indebtedness or evictions. Families are much less likely to
benefit from family and parenting support when their basic needs are not met.
2. Improve access to and use of mental health and psychosocial support services for
parents and other caregivers of young children are essential. Digital interventions
for anxiety and depression might include information provision, connectivity and
triage, automated and blended therapeutic interventions (such as apps and online
programmes), and telephone calls and home visits, especially for those without
connectivity. Given the need to disseminate affordable mental health support widely
due to COVID-19, group-based telehealth interventions may allow for an increased
reach of psychological services in a time of elevated need.
3. More evidence is needed on scalable responsive caregiving interventions,
responsive caregiving, early learning activities and play, appropriate for the
conditions of physical distancing and lockdowns. Programs that foster peer support
and online platforms should be evaluated to ensure acceptable efficacy in supporting
caregivers with young children, particularly on aspects of early learning and play.
Guidance and resources to help parents with balancing screen time with physically
active, screen-free activities may be warranted.
4. Child protection systems should be redesigned, and educators trained to identify

signs of child abuse and neglect specific to a distance-learning model. Home visitation
programmes, with appropriate protection of social service staff, should continue to the
extent possible, particularly with high-risk families. To increase awareness and access
to reporting hotlines and other maltreatment reporting resources, policy makers may
consider a variety of dissemination means, including public signage, as well as
broadcast and social media.

A recent report of case studies of programme implementation to support nurturing care during
COVID-19 illustrates several innovative examples of how organizations in various contexts have
adapted to support nurturing care efforts during COVID-19 [117]. For instance, programmes
have organized emergency food delivery services for vulnerable families. Others have developed

new training materials for frontline workers that integrate both mental health and nurturing care
components. Organizations concerned with children's health and development in many countries
have implemented virtual caregiver support meetings, telephone or internet-guided learning
activities for young children, and online stress reduction resources for parents and other
caregivers.
The evidence in this rapid review was primarily collected during the pandemic's first stage of
lockdowns, representing only the early phase of the pandemic. Future research must investigate
the longer-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families as we enter a period of a gradual
relaxation of lockdown measures in some regions and second waves in others. Gaps in the
evidence base remain, with a lack of studies in low- and middle-income countries. There is an
urgent need for action-oriented implementation studies – those that go beyond identifying trends
and begin to pinpoint "what works" to effectively promote and protect nurturing care during
health emergencies such as COVID-19. In particular, there is a need to identify effective
interventions and strategies for families experiencing income loss, food insecurity, mothers with
young children, families with disabled children, and those with pre-existing mental health
challenges. Also, further inquiry is needed into the effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on early
learning and children's play, which is transformative for children, allowing them to creatively
develop their imagination, dexterity, and growth. The relative absence of studies related to early
learning and playful parenting indicates a need for additional evidence on the nature and
prevalence of early learning and playful parenting and innovative ways to protect and promote
them during health emergencies.

participants were asked
to answer the following
free response question:
Please describe in your
own words how the
coronavirus outbreak is
affecting your mental
health and your child’s
mental health.

Both parents and children appear to be experiencing
loss, worry and changes in mood and behaviour as a
result of the rapid social changes that have occurred.
Some parents reported feeling overwhelmed and
described the impact of child understanding and
awareness. Finally, a minority of parents reported that
COVID-19 has had little impact on mental health in
their family, or has even led to improvements.

conducted from April 21
to May 9, 2020, to
examine the relationships
among COVID-19 risk
factors, mental health
risk factors, protective
factors, parental
perceived stress, and
child abuse potential.

Greater COVID-19 related stressors and high anxiety
and depressive symptoms are associated with higher
parental perceived stress. Receipt of financial assistance
and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are
associated with higher child abuse potential.
Conversely, greater parental support and perceived
control during the pandemic are associated with lower
perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results
indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19
related stressors. 10% reported a positive change:
having more time with family.

rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental
health, while negative perception on homecare therapy

(i.e., in late February)

Most respondents (66.5%) had to stop working or to
start working from home. A general worsening of sleep
quality and distortion of time experience in both
mothers and children, as well as increasing emotional
symptoms and self-regulation difficulties in children,
was observed. Moreover, even when the interplay
between the behavioral and psychological factors was
investigated, the factor that seems to mostly impact
both mothers' and children's psychological well-being
was their sleep quality.

of mothers showing at least mild symptoms of
psychological distress in early April, as compared to
41% of women without school-age children. (In the
U.S., schools closed in all states between March 16-24)
This new gap in psychological distress observed

paid work, exercise,
personal care, childcare
and sleep.

On average, fathers are now doing some childcare
during 8 hours of the day, compared with 4 hours in
2014/15. Of parents who were in paid work prior to the
lockdown, mothers are one-and-a-half times more
likely than fathers to have either lost their job or quit
since the lockdown began. In 2014/15, mothers were in
paid work at 80% of the rate of fathers; now this is
70% of the fathers’ rate. Compared with fathers,
mothers are spending less time on paid work but more
time on household responsibilities.

Results show an overall increase in domestic
responsibilities for mothers, who were already doing
most of the household labor, as well as an increase in
fathers’ contributions. Driven by increases in fathers’
time spent on housework and childcare, we find that
both mothers and fathers report a general shift toward
more egalitarian divisions of household labor.

‘extremely’ or ‘somewhat’ satisfied with how they

During the restrictions, the proportions of fathers and

An online survey
conducted in April and
July 2019 and April
2020 to examine changes
in employment status,
hours of work, childcare,
income and satisfaction
regarding their work and
family during the
emergency.

Both men and women are spending more time on
housework and childcare, but the distribution is
unequal: with 68% of women spending more time in
housework and only 40% of men. The percentages for
childcare are 61% and 51%, respectively. Hence, while
most of the burden has fallen on women, the additional
childcare is more equally shared than housework. Yet
this balance disappears when we consider the amount
of time spent on housework: 64% of women and 58%
of men increase the amount of housework they do.
Another predictor of higher child-related workload is
the age of the children: children younger than 10 years
old require more time from both working mothers and
fathers. Working women with children age 0–5 are
those most likely to report it is difficult to balance
work and family due to excessive domestic
responsibilities.

mothers have been carrying a heavier load on the
provision of childcare. In households with children,
44% of women report being the sole provider of care
for their children as compared to 14% of men. Even
while currently working, women are 27 percentage
points more likely to be the only providers of childcare
than working men, and 41 percentage points less likely
to report that their partner is the only provider of care.
Among working parents who are married or living with
a partner, women were 17 percentage points more
likely than men to become the sole childcare provider

For some respondents the lockdown brought advantages, such as increased
time at home and the presence of fathers and other co-parents. However,
for many the time was one of very considerable stress. Women cited
feeling rushed out of hospital, poor follow-up care and poor access to
information and support once at home as the main barriers to establishing
breastfeeding with their babies. Black or Black British respondents were
least likely to have had any contact with breastfeeding support
organisations or charities. Younger respondents (<25 years of age) were
most likely to cite the following as main concerns, all of which were
higher than their older counterparts: their mental health, financial worries,
relationship with others, eating a healthy diet, getting reliable pregnancy
information and housing issues. Greater numbers of respondents whose
income is below £16k reported to have concerns for their emotional and

had negative beliefs about the values and benefits of online
learning and preferred traditional learning in early childhood
settings. They tended to resist and even reject online learning
for three key reasons: shortcomings of online learning, young
children’s inadequate self-regulation, and their lack of time
and professional knowledge in supporting children’s online
learning. Also, the hardship caused by the COVID-19
pandemic has made them suffer, thus more resistant to online

More than half of respondents reported they do not have

caregivers who are not literate. A large difference between
urban and rural locations was also observed for families’
access to electricity and technologies to support children’s
learning. Most have received little support from schools or
local governments. Only 10% of caregivers reported they have
been in contact with pre-primary teachers or school principals,
with significant differences by household wealth and across
regions. Only half report they have engaged in supporting
learning activities for pre-primary children, which favours
families living in urban areas. Mothers are most likely to be
responsible for supporting children’s learning at home; yet
mothers are less likely to be literate. Around three quarters
reported they play more often with their child since the
COVID-19 crisis than before, including telling stories or
singing songs. However, caregivers from poorer households or
who are illiterate are less likely to engage in such activities.
Only 12% said they had used radio lessons with their children.

involved in any school activity at the date of interview.
Changes in reading to preschool children, who listen to their
parents reading, increased by almost half an hour more per
day. During lockdown, all children watched about twice as
much TV (about 3 hours for kindergarten and primary school
children). Labor market restrictions imposed during lockdown
resulted in increases in fathers’ involvement in childcare and
homeschooling. Fathers’ involvement had a positive
association with child emotional well-being, but no impact on
reading hours and educational progress.

children. Technological barriers (bad internet connectivity,
costs of internet connection and limited availability of a devise
to connect) while significant were not the highest reported
challenges. Overall, there was a consensus that school closures
are going to lead to school dropout, which respondents link to
the impact that COVID-19 is having on livelihoods and to the
perceived increase in child labour.

to compare behaviours before
and during the COVID-19
outbreak.

Change in child and youth outdoor behaviour ranged from 1
(much less play) to 5 (much more play) with 3 representing
no change. Overall, we found that all regions exhibited a
decrease in time spent outdoors and in outdoor play (i.e.,
below 3), with Ontario having experienced the greatest
decline in both time spent outdoors and in outdoor play (p <

Over 80% of children are reported by participating
parents/carers to be getting at least 30 minutes of exercise a
day but only 22% are reported to be getting the
recommended 3 hours. Almost half of the children (47%)
are reported to be spending no time playing with another
child in their household. The top 3 stressors for
participating parents/carers were (i) work, (ii) child’s screen
time, (iii) their child’s wellbeing. Participating
parents/carers particularly want support around managing
children’s emotions, educational demands, behaviours and
coming out of social isolation.

The most common physical activities during the earlyCOVID-19 period were free play/unstructured activity (e.g.,
running around, tag) (90% of children) and going for a walk
(55% of children). Children engaged in about 90 min of
school-related sitting and over 8 h of leisure-related sitting a
day. Girls and older children generally spent more time in
sedentary behaviors than boys and younger children.
Children were more likely to perform physical activity at
home indoors or on neighborhood streets during the earlyvs. pre-COVID-19 periods.

Leverage monthly data to predict the

Using counterfactual distribution of county-level
data from Florida, results show the number of
reported child maltreatment allegations was
approximately 27% or 15,000 lower than expected
for the months of March and April 2020, the first
two months in which schools closed. Counties with
higher numbers of educators trained to identify and
report child maltreatment (e.g., school
psychologists and school nurses) experience a
disproportionately larger reduction in the number of
child maltreatment allegations.

Relative to 2018 and 2019 trends during the same

approximately 55% following the emergency
declaration. Maltreatment referrals begin to slowly
return to pre-COVID-19 levels around 7 weeks
following the emergency declaration, but never
fully rebound during the study period. As time at
home during the pandemic increased, the risk of
supervisory neglect increased, with largest impacts
in metropolitan counties and counties with more
poverty.

Results show domestic-related police calls
increased by 8% during the stay at home order. The
effects are largest in areas with more households
that are married with children, areas with relatively
high rates of rental residences, and areas that
experienced the largest changes in staying at home.
Did not find significant effects for domestic crimes
against children, as measured by physical child
abuse. This result may indicate that although
domestic crimes rose in March-April 2020, calls for
child abuse fell, potentially due to lessened
visibility of child victims and limitations of various
reporting channels for child maltreatment crimes.

Crosssectional

An online survey was distributed to
all domestic violence refuges in
Norway from April 8-23, 2020, with
the aim of obtaining an overview of
the impact of the COVID‐19 crisis
and the virus control measures on
victims of domestic violence and
abuse. The survey contained 15 items
with fixed answers, follow‐up
questions and an opportunity for the
refuges to provide supplementary
qualitative descriptions and
examples.

56% of respondents reported there had been a
reduction in the number of requests from clients,
many expressed concerns that it is ‘too quiet out
there.’ Refuge staff reported being most concerned
about children. Refuge staff were concerned that
children exposed to violence who were living
outside of the refuge would no longer receive the
help that they need from professionals; and,
moreover, that the violence they experience would
remain undisclosed, as contact between adults
outside of the family and the abused child is
dramatically reduced. Closed schools and daycare
centres are of particular concern as school
represents normality and a zone free from the
abusive parent.

April and May 2020, the number of reports was
approximately half of what was expected.
Significant decreases in child maltreatment
reporting were also noted for all reporter subtypes
including mandated reporters such as educational
personnel, child care personnel and medical health
personnel, and non-mandated reporters such as
family members and neighbours.

Over 1 in 5 parents/caregivers (22%) surveyed
reported an increase in their use of negative or
violent parenting methods. 32% of households had
a child and/or parent/caregiver reporting that
violence had occurred in the home, including
children and/or adults being verbally or physically
abused. The vast majority of parents/caregivers
(89%) reported an increase in negative feelings due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. While 83% of the
parents/caregivers reported an increase in negative
feelings when schools were closed between 1 to 4
weeks, the reports of negative feelings were higher
for the vast majority of adults (95%) when schools
had been closed for 17 to 19 weeks.

respect to the context of the COVID19 pandemic within the United States
and Israel.

Professionals in both countries were extremely
concerned by the lack of opportunity to report the
abuse. A surge in reports of intrafamilial child
sexual abuse (IFCSA) was predicted after the
COVID-19 period ends. Findings reveal mostly
negative changes in the dynamics of IFCSA
families during COVID-19, including financial,
environmental, and emotional hardships, as well as
some positive changes in relationships among
family members. Risks of transferring to internet

included technical issues, limited internet access
among ultra-Orthodox families, lack of proper
separate space for therapy, and difficulties engaging
younger children.

narratives. Assessed the impact of
COVID-19 on organisational design
and, the workers’ ability to conduct a
diagnosis of a child’s care context.

Results pointed towards challenges to facilitating
children's protection during the pandemic. CPWs
reported more difficulty identifying children and
families in need; a decrease in referrals from the
formal network (typically schools and
kindergartens); perception of overload of the work
by the networking partners; and a drop in provision
of services for families in need, especially family
therapy, psychology and child psychiatry. CPWs
reported that child well-being and protection
became a secondary consideration, and families'
basic food needs and individual health protection
from the virus became priorities.
