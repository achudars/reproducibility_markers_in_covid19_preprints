Abstract
We here predicted some trajectories of COVID-19 in the coming days (until April 30, 2020)
using the most advanced Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). Our
analysis predicted very frightening outcomes, which defines to worsen the conditions in Iran,
entire Europe, especially Italy, Spain, and France. While South Korea, after the initial blast, has
come to stability, the same goes for the COVID-19 origin country China with more positive
recovery cases and confirm to remain stable. The United States of America (USA) will come as a
surprise and going to become the epicenter for new cases during the mid-April 2020. Based on
our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp the power
exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are urgently needed to
curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since January 2020, the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 [SARS-CoV-2])
from Wuhan, China, has continued to spread around the world and turned into Pandemic as
novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1-2]. Due to rapid pandemic potential and the absence
of vaccines and drugs, the contagious COVID-19 disease devastated the normal life across the
globe. Currently, Coronavirus infected more than half a million population, and killed more than
25 thousand people, and also forced more than 3 billion to stay with their homes [3]. Due to a
lack of knowledge about this virus, the COVID-19 pandemic placed tremendous strain on
everyone around the world. In order to prevent further transmission, strong preventive measures
are intensified from the past weeks; however, the number of infected cases are consistently
increasing around the world, even after undergoing lockdown.
Mathematical approaches are widely used to infer critical epidemiological transitions and
parameters of COVID-19. Methods such as epidemic curve fitting, surveillance data during the
early transmission R0, and other epidemic models are frequently applied to generate forecasts of
COVID-19 pandemic across the world [4-6].
Methods
We used the data of cumulative confirmed death and recovery of COVID-19 cases reported from
January 21 until March 26, 2020, that were obtained from John Hopkins Coronavirus resource
center (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). We analyzed the data using dynamic models to generate 30
days forecasts and to understand the positive effect in the near future as well as projecting trends
over trajectories. We used different statistical phenomenological models in the R-language
platform to analyze the disease-based trajectories model for prediction purposes. We precisely
used four models to analyze the aggregate data set for time series analysis. This includes the

ARIMA model, which is a mass model of two different models, including the AR model (Auto
Regression) and the MA (Moving Average) model [7]. This model results over Akaike
information criterion (AIC) statistics and coverage of regression analysis.
Another type of COVID-19, like SARS disease (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), is
analyzed without breaking the current situation and predicting the future perspective [8]. VAR
model (Vector Auto Average) model is used to predict the spatial extinct while using remote
sensing data and for the purpose of creation of GIS map of worldwide on three different
variables [9]. These three variables in the GIS environment create a map of cumulative
confirmed cases country-wise as well as recovered and death map [10]. The use of another
statistical analysis is a generalized logistic growth model (GLM), which generally depicted as a
scaling parameter of integrating an additional result-oriented value put method [11]. Some
epidemic models used in disease epidemic conditions measure oscillates some multiple peak
parameters inferred in sub-epidemic and pandemic conditions to determine the projected
outcomes [12].
After standardizing all the models, the data of the top 20 countries were included to analyze the
forecasting models of differential spatial adjacent, and projected trajectories are analyzed up to
April 30, 2020. By using GIS and Remote sensing to determine the epidemic mapping and
analyzing the upcoming effects of COVID-19.
Results and discussion
An overview of epidemic trends of COVID-19 across 170 countries and territories from January
to March 26, 2020, is presented in Figure 1. From these top 20 countries, with a high number of
confirmed cases are stratified to include in mathematical mode. The comparison between

cumulative incident cases, mortality, and recovery of COVID-19 information among the top 15
affected countries is shown in Figure 2. Top countries' data of China, Italy, Spain, and Iran
showed highly disastrous mortality and badly effected with a vast number of COVID-19 cases.
On the other hand, some European countries such as Switzerland, United Kingdom, Netherlands,
Austria, Belgium, Norway, and Sweden had huge confirmed cases but negligible number in case
of recover and death cases.
Furthermore, data smoothening was applied to stabilize the data by removing changes in the
level of a time series, and therefore eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality. After this,
the forecast prediction model was applied by using AR and MA models to generate plots of the
different trends in upcoming days. The outcome of these predictions is presented in Figure 3.
Our findings revealed linearity in the current cumulative cases and showed a rapid exponential
growth phase in the world span may occur roughly during April 8 to April 30, 2020, when the
number of COVID-19 cases may skyrocket near to one million in the USA, 300,000 in Italy, and
250,000 in Germany, 150,000 in the United Kingdom and Iran (120,000). Other countries with a
smaller number of cases but showing a sharp upward trend include Switzerland, Austria, and
Canada. However, the cases of COVID-19 in China and South Korea remain stable. Public
health officials in these countries need to grasp the powerful wave of exponential growth before
COVID-19 collapses the entire health system.
The fast raising COVID-19 infection rates may lead to the exponential death toll in the top 15
countries. Our analysis detected that the number of deaths would increase more rapidly in
thousands during the mid of April 2020 (Figure 4). The associated mortality rate will be much
higher in Italy, and Spain with roughly 30,000 deaths in each country, following France, USA
and Iran will record around 10,000 deaths, and also the death in UK, Netherlands, Belgium, and

Switzerland started to incline the death rates rapidly than the rest of current top 15 countries. The
recovery rates will stay slow in initial time but then rapidly increase in Italy, Germany, Spain,
and Iran by the end of prediction (Figure 5).
Our forecast analysis of COVID-19 dynamics showed a different angle for the whole world, and
it looks scarier than imagined. Overall, our analysis confirmed the with an increase in the
number of cases, the number of deaths is going to rise exponentially to rising in the future time
(Figure 6). Interestingly, the recovery numbers also look promising, going to pack up during
mid-April. Thus, it can slow down the surge of COVID-19 pandemic by the end of April.
Conclusion
Based on our predictions, public health officials should tailor aggressive interventions to grasp
the power exponential growth, and rapid infection control measures at hospital levels are
urgently needed to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.
