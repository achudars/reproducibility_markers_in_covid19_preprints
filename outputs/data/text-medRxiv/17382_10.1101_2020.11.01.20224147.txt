ABSTRACT
Background. The ability to preferentially protect high-groups in COVID-19 is hotly debated. Here,
the aim is to present simple metrics of such precision shielding of people at high-risk of death after
infection by SARS-CoV-2; demonstrate how they can estimated; and examine whether precision
shielding was successfully achieved in the first COVID-19 wave.
Methods. The shielding ratio, S, is defined as the ratio of prevalence of infection among people at a
high-risk group versus among people in a low-risk group. The contrasted risk groups examined here
are according to age (>=70 versus <70 years), and institutionalized (nursing home) setting. For agerelated precision shielding, data were used from large seroprevalence studies with separate
prevalence data for elderly versus non-elderly and with at least 1000 assessed people >=70 years old.
For setting-related precision shielding, data were analyzed from 10 countries where information was
available on numbers of nursing home residents, proportion of nursing home residents among
COVID-19 deaths, and overall population infection fatality rate.
Findings. Across 17 seroprevalence studies, the shielding ratio S for elderly versus non-elderly
varied between 0.4 (substantial shielding) and 1.6 (substantial inverse protection, i.e. low-risk people
being protected more than high-risk people). Five studies in USA all yielded S=0.4-0.8, consistent
with some shielding being achieved, while two studies in China yielded S=1.5-1.6, consistent with
inverse protection. Assuming 25% infection fatality rate among nursing home residents, S values for
nursing home residents ranged from 0.07 to 3.1. The best shielding was seen in South Korea
(S=0.07) and modest shielding was achieved in Israel, Slovenia, Germany, and Denmark. No
shielding was achieved in Hungary and Sweden. In Belgium (S=1.9), UK (S=2.2) and Spain (S=3.1),
nursing home residents were far more frequently infected that the rest of the population.

Interpretation. The experience from the first wave of COVID-19 suggests that different locations
and settings varied markedly in the extent to which they protected high-risk groups. Both effective
precision shielding and detrimental inverse protection can happen in real-life circumstances. COVID19 interventions should seek to achieve maximal precision shielding.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study
There is very heated debate on whether targeted protection of high-risk groups is a feasible strategy
for management of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is strong evidence for risk stratification in
COVID-19 risk of death after infection, with major effects of age, institutionalized setting, and other
factors. It is less known whether high-risk groups defined according to age and institutionalization
criteria have been preferentially protected at all until now in the real-world experience of the first
wave of COVID-19.
Added value of this study
The shielding ratio is introduced, as the ratio of the proportion of people infected in a group at high
risk of death when infected versus the group at low risk of death when infected. It is shown how the
shielding ratio can be derived from seroprevalence studies; and how it can be inferred indirectly also
from data on the proportion of deaths in the high-risk group. Shielding ratios are estimated for 17
large seroprevalence studies worldwide and they show wide variation (0.4-1.6), suggesting a range
from substantial shielding to inverse protection (where low-risk people have been more protected
than the high-risk ones). Shielding ratios are also calculated for nursing home residents in 10
countries and are found to have even greater variation (0.07-3.1). Some countries achieved precision
shielding for high-risk groups according to age and institutionalization status and had minimal
fatalities in the first wave. Conversely, countries with inverse protection had very high fatality loads.
Implications of all the available evidence
Both major precision shielding and inverse protection can be seen in real-world data. Interventions to
manage COVID-19 need to be examined on whether they can achieve substantial precision shielding
and monitored for their impact on such shielding.

A major tension in the scientific community regarding the management of the COVID-19
pandemic is between proponents of targeted approaches, where people at high-risk are preferentially
protected, and those who believe that such approaches are practically infeasible.1-3 The term
precision shielding will be used henceforth to denote the extent to which people at higher risk of
death (if infected) can be made to be less frequently infected than people for whom infection would
carry a lower risk of death.
The tension between these opposing schools may be exacerbated because to-date there is
mostly theoretical polarized debate without solid quantification of precision shielding. It would be
useful to have standard metrics that can assess whether precision shielding is achieved. This would
allow to explore the feasibility of these debated approaches in real-life data and to monitor the impact
of different non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 using such metrics.
The aim of this article is to present simple metrics of precision shielding; demonstrate how
they can estimated from stratified population seroprevalence data or from information on proportion
of deaths occurring in high-risk groups; and examine whether precision shielding was successfully
achieved in the first wave of COVID-19, or, conversely, high-risk groups were more frequently
infected than low-risk groups (“inverse protection”).

METHODS
Conceptual background of precision shielding
Precision shielding stems from the concept of precision medicine and precision public
health.4 The terms stratified medicine, individualized medicine, and personalized medicine are also
used. The success of the concept has two prerequisites: first, the ability to identify and separate
reliably individuals who have very different risks; and second, the availability of effective

interventions specifically for those at high-risk. The proof that these prerequisites have been met is
provided by the improved outcomes of these select, high-risk individuals who are targeted precisely.
There is very strong evidence that the risk of severe adverse outcomes and death in SARSCoV-2 infected individuals shows extreme risk stratification according to age, and additional
substantial risk stratification is possible according to gender, socioeconomic and clinical features.5-8
Different individuals (e.g. children versus debilitated elderly people) vary over 1000-fold in their
estimated risk of death and other serious outcomes (e.g. hospitalization), if infected. Therefore, since
the first prerequisite is met, the main question is whether the second prerequisite can also be met, i.e.
whether interventions exist that can offer enhanced protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection targeted
to those individuals who are at high-risk.

Metrics of precision shielding
To answer this question, it is important to have some robust metrics that can assess reliably
whether precision shielding is achieved or not. The most direct measure is the ratio of prevalence of
ensuing infections among people at a high-risk group versus the prevalence of infections among
people in a low-risk group. Let us call this ratio, S, the shielding ratio. The contrasted risk groups
need to be specified: e.g. according to age (e.g. >=70 versus <70 years old), setting (e.g.
institutionalized versus non-institutionalized), socioeconomic background, or multi-variable risk
scores.
The potential benefit of precision shielding would be greater, when the shielding ratio is
lower. A shielding ratio of S=1 means that low- and high-risk people are equally frequently infected,
a shielding ratio of S=0.5 means that that high-risk people have half the risk of being infected than

low-risk ones. S may also take values above 1, if somehow high-risk people get more frequently
infected than low-risk people.
In this framework, the number of lives saved by precision shielding of some high-risk group
is proportional to the infection fatality rate (IFR) in the high-risk group, IFRh, the proportion of the
high-risk group in the population, fh, and the complement of the shielding ratio, 1-S. The number of
COVID-19 deaths in the high-risk group is

Dh=S*P*IFRh*fh*N (eq. 1)

and the number of COVID-19 deaths in the low-risk group is

Dl=P*IFRl*(1-fh)*N (eq. 2)

where P is the prevalence of the infection in the low-risk group and N is the total population of
interest. The proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in the high-risk group is then given by

G=Dh/(Dh+Dl)= S*IFRh*fh/(S*IFRh*fh)+IFRl*(1-fh) (eq. 3)

Estimation of precision shielding from prevalence data
Seroprevalence studies that assess the frequency of infection in the general population (or in
samples that try to approximate the general population) can be used to examine the extent of
precision shielding achieved in different risk groups. Seroprevalence studies do have several caveats
and biases that have been previously described, e.g. related to sampling and selection biases and test

performance.9,10 When their data are used to evaluate whether precision shielding has been achieved,
some additional issues should be considered. Specifically, the sampling and selection biases and the
test performance of the antibody assays may be different in groups of high- versus low-risk
individuals.
For example, if the high- versus low-risk groups are defined based on age, sampling bias and
selection forces may be different in the two groups. E.g. individuals in poorer health (and thus at
higher risk of poor outcomes if infected with SARS-CoV-2) may be less likely to be sampled. This
bias may be more prominent in the elderly group in some studies or in the non-elderly group in
others. Or, antibody test performance (sensitivity and specificity) may be different in the elderly
versus non-elderly group, e.g. infections that do not generate detectable antibodies or where antibody
titers decline faster may be more common in younger people who experience a less severe
infection,11 or in those who are older and more debilitated to launch an immune response.
Acknowledging these caveats, one can assess the shielding ratio S for elderly (e.g. >=70 years
old) versus non-elderly in large seroprevalence studies that have substantial amounts of data for both
these high- and low-risk groups. Here, seroprevalence studies from 4 recent systematic reviews10,12-14
were screened. Studies were selected for analysis if they had at least 1000 participants >=70 years
old, so that a substantial amount of data from this group would be available for a meaningful
assessment against the younger age group.
Information was extracted on the crude seroprevalence in the elderly versus non-elderly
group. Whenever adjusted estimates were provided (e.g. adjusting for test performance,
demographics, sampling or design features, ethnicity/race, and/or other factors), the maximally
adjusted estimates were also extracted for each group. Unadjusted and adjusted estimates were
compared, but the latter were preferred, whenever available. The default comparison used a 70 years

cut-off, but when data were not presented for this cut-off, a lower cut-off (the one most proximal to
70 years) was used. The share of the high-risk group (>=70 years) in the general population was
derived from population pyramids for the respective countries/locations.

Estimation of precision shielding from proportion of COVID-19 deaths occurring in the high-risk
group
For many risk factors other than age, data on the prevalence of the infection in high- and lowrisk groups may not be available. In these cases, one can estimate the shielding ratio S if the
proportion of COVID-19 deaths that are contributed by the high-risk group (G), the relative share of
the high-risk group in the general population (fh), and the IFR in the low- and high-risk groups (IFRl
IFRh) are known or can be reasonably approximated. S is then obtained by solving equation 3 for S.

S=G*IFRl*(1-fh)/(IFRh*(fh-G*fh)) (eq. 4)

For example, extremely high risk of COVID-19 death is seen in institutionalized elderly
individuals in nursing homes, where IFRh is in the range of 25%,15 i.e. about 1000-fold higher than in
non-institutionalized people. As of this writing, there are no large published seroprevalence studies
to-date that have evaluated representative samples of nursing home residents at national level in
different countries. However, one can estimate S by using available data from countries where there
is information on the proportion of COVID-19 deaths that happened among institutionalized elderly
people, the share of this group in the general population, and the IFR in the general population (and
hence also in the non-institutionalized population). A range of values 15-35% for IFRh may be used
in sensitivity analyses with IFR=25% in the baseline scenario.

For the purposes of calculations done here, information of nursing and elderly home beds in
different countries and on the proportion of COVID-19 deaths that occurred in nursing homes in the
first wave is derived from the International Long Term Care Policy Network16 considering the last
update of their review on COVID-19 mortality in nursing homes (released on October 14, 2020).
Information on the overall population IFR is derived from ref. 10; data were used only from
countries where IFR estimation had been informed from >1500 samples, so that there would be less
uncertainty on the IFR estimate. IFR in non-institutionalized people is calculated by the overall IFR
excluding the deaths in nursing homes from the numerator and the number of nursing home residents
from the denominator (country population).

RESULTS
Precision shielding according to age
Table 1 shows the characteristics of 17 eligible large population seroprevalence studies17-33
where results were separately available in elderly versus younger groups. Table 2 shows the
shielding ratios based on crude (unadjusted) and adjusted seroprevalence data. As shown, the
shielding ratio ranged from 0.4 to 1.6.
The elderly were infected substantially more frequently than the younger populations in Spain
and China and possibly in Hungary, although in Hungary the 95% confidence interval (CI) could not
exclude values less than 1. Two studies in China yielded very similar estimates of S (1.5-1.6). The
Dominican Republic, India, and Canada had S values very close to 1.0 (no shielding) and 95% CIs
exclude major shielding. Modest shielding was suggested in Brazil (estimated S=0.8), but the 95%
CI could not exclude values above 1. In the USA, five studies all show S value estimates below 1,
with three of them yielding modest estimates of S=0.8 and the other two yielding S=0.6 and S=0.4,

but with largely overlapping CIs. The two lowest estimates come from studies on life insurance
applicants and blood donors, where selection biases that depend on age cannot be excluded. E.g.
stronger healthy volunteer bias may exist in the elderly life insurance applicants and blood donors.
The best S values (S=0.5-0.7) suggesting relatively successful age-related shielding were seen in
Denmark, Iceland and in 2 studies in the UK, but the 95% CI had large uncertainty in Denmark.
Of note, most of the seroprevalence estimates in Table 1 were from crude, unadjusted
analyses (positive samples per total tested samples). Adjustments were used only in the Denmark,
Spain, UK, Brazil, USA-hemodialysis, USA-New York studies, and adjusted point estimates tended
to be similar to the unadjusted ones. The proportion of people >=70 years old in the general
population was 9-15% in high-income countries, and 4-7% in other countries.

Precision shielding according to institutionalized setting
Table 3 runs calculations for precision shielding of nursing home residents in 10 countries
during the first wave of COVID-19. They include 8 European countries, Israel and South Korea.
As shown, Belgium, UK, and Spain have had very unfavorable S values (S=1.9, 2.2. and 3.1
in the baseline scenario, potentially even higher in sensitivity analyses). This means that people who
were institutionalized in nursing homes were approximately twice as likely to be infected than the
non-institutionalized population in Belgium and the UK, and more than 3 times more likely to be
infected than the non-institutionalized population in Spain.
Sweden and Hungary seemed to have been unable to protect their nursing homes more than
the general population and sensitivity analysis for Sweden suggests that it is possible that nursing
home residents were even infected more than twice as frequently than the rest of the population.
Some substantial shielding was seen in Denmark, Slovenia, Germany, and Israel (S=0.3-0.5 in the

baseline scenario). Extremely effective shielding was achieved in South Korea, where one can
estimate S=0.07. Only 8% of COVID-19 deaths in this country occurred in nursing home residents.

DISCUSSION
Shielding ratio and overall load of fatalities
The shielding ratio can be used as a metric to assess whether protection of high-risk
populations is being achieved in a given country or jurisdiction. As shown, data from the first wave
of COVID-19 suggest that the shielding ratio can take very different values, ranging from extremely
effective protection of vulnerable high-risk populations to major inverse protection, where high-risk
populations have been protected far less successfully than low-risk populations.
Fatality rates tend to be relatively low in countries where the elderly (and even more so the
institutionalized elderly) have been effectively protected. It is possible that one can achieve better
values of shielding (lower S) in nursing homes than in non-institutionalized elderly who are
unavoidably more freely mobile in the community. Countries that have avoided massive infections in
nursing homes, have had much lower fatality burden from COVID-19 in the first wave. It is
estimated16 that in the first wave only 0.01% of South Korean nursing home residents died with
COVID-19, as opposed to 3.3% in Sweden and more than 5% in Belgium, England, and Spain.
While there may be differences on how deaths are attributed to COVID-19 among nursing home
residents, these are unlikely to explain away such major differences across countries. Besides nursing
homes, some differential protection can be achieved even for the non-institutionalized elderly and
this may result in substantially lower fatalities overall. Thus, Iceland and Denmark did have 20% and
35% of the COVID-19 occur in nursing homes, but they seem to have protected effectively their
elderly; therefore, they have had low fatalities in the first wave.

The worst fatality rates have been seen in locations with high proportions of elderly and/or
institutionalized people and where there was strong inverse protection. For example, Castiglione
d’Adda,34 a small town in Lombardy had 47 COVID-19 deaths in a population of 4550 people.
Seroprevalence data34 showed IgG positivity in 51/155 people >=60 years old versus 64/290 in
younger people, which translate into S=1.5 for age-related shielding and the town also had nursing
homes affected. Another seroprevalence study in Northern Italy locations found that seroprevalence
was 4.5 times larger in nursing home residents compared to non-institutionalized people.35 While
these data may not necessarily be representative of Italy as a whole, they are congruent with the very
high fatalities in particular areas of Lombardy.36
Some countries may have had mixed patterns, e.g. protecting somehow their elderly, but not
specifically their institutionalized elderly, as in the case of the UK and probably also the USA where
44% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in the 0.59% of the population that resides in nursing homes.16
This pattern can still translate to heavy cumulative death toll. Institutionalized elderly are at much
higher risk of death than other elderly people, and they can contribute a lion’s share to the overall
death count.
While only age and nursing home residence were explored here, other risk factors may also
be assessed in a similar fashion in terms of the extent of precision shielding. For example,
socioeconomic factors are known to be strong determinants of the infection rate.37 Minorities and
disadvantaged populations are more likely to be infected and it is possible that may also have more
adverse outcomes due to poorer health status.

Impact of horizontal and targeted measures on precision shielding metrics

Different measures against the spread of COVID-19 need to be assessed in terms of their
effect on precision shielding. One might argue that horizontal measures to mitigate COVID-19 for
everyone without making discriminations according to risk would have S=1, as infection rates would
be decreased equally in all groups. In many/most circumstances, this may not hold true. Most
measures may eventually leave some population subgroups more exposed than others. The groups
that still remain unavoidably highly exposed may occasionally be among those that have lower risk
(e.g. young, healthy military personnel in congested areas like barracks or military vessels).
However, in most situations horizontal measures may unintentionally leave high-risk groups more
exposed than low-risk groups.
For example, horizontal lockdown measures typically protect young, healthy professionals
who can work from home, but leave far more exposed the essential workers and those who are
disadvantaged, e.g. the homeless. These poorly sheltered populations often have a higher burden of
background comorbidities and more limited medical care – and are thus at higher risk of death, if
infected by SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, horizontal lockdowns may leave nursing home populations less
protected than non-institutionalized populations, unless additional targeted measures are taken
focused on nursing homes specifically. Nursing home residents have very limited mobility and often
live together in closed, congested spaces – as opposed to young, healthy individuals who shelter in
place alone or in smaller numbers with their families. Thus, massive infections are easier to occur in
nursing homes. The situation may become even worse, if nursing home personnel also has a high S
value, since personnel will then infect the residents. This was apparently the case with Stockholm
during the first wave, where seroprevalence among nursing home personnel was 23% in the first 20
days of April,38 three times higher than general population of Stockholm at the same time. Nursing
home personnel in Stockholm was highly mobile and exposed across different nursing homes.

Lockdown measures also force young low-risk individuals to spend more time indoors and this may
increase the exposure of any high-risk family members who have to live in the same house.

Implications for future interventions and metrics of their success
The most-widely used metric for the success of interventions against COVID-19 to-date has
been the number of infections. This metric alone is problematic, because the vast majority of
infections remain unrecorded and the documented infections depend on how many tests are done. A
more informative metric of success is the ability of different interventions to generate a most
favorable shielding ratio for the most high-risk subgroups of the population. These subgroups may
account for the vast majority of the potential deaths and, if properly protected, many deaths can be
avoided.
Estimates for the shielding ratio and its evolution as the epidemic wave progresses and as
different interventions are employed can be obtained from prevalence studies using antibodies, or
other tests (e.g. antigen testing).39,40 Alternatively, they can be obtained from assessments of the
profile of fatalities, provided that the relative representation of the high-risk groups of interest in the
general population is known, and that some fair estimate of the IFR in low-and high-risk groups
exists from previous studies. S can be used as an outcome in COVID-19 interventional studies.41

Limitations
Estimates of precision shielding may have some considerable error margin and biases,
inherent in the parameters that go in the calculation of S. Thus, one has to interpret the ensuing S
values with caution and allow for substantial uncertainty. These values should be able to convey
whether some substantial shielding is achieved, or whether gross inverse protection is making things

worse. Small differences in S estimates should not be over-interpreted. Validation with multiple,
preferably large and unbiased, studies on the same population may help get a better sense of the
accuracy and heterogeneity of such estimates.
Most data analyzed here came from high income countries. Limited data from two other
countries (India and Dominican Republic) showed estimates of S very close to 1, suggesting no
achieved shielding. It is possible that shielding is more difficult to achieve in some resource-poor
settings and in congested, highly-mixing populations where most people cannot shelter effectively
and have limited private space, living in multigenerational families. Similarly, even within the same
country, or sub-location, there may be sub-populations that can achieve much better precision
shielding than others, due to socioeconomic circumstances and other factors. Job circumstances may
be particularly important and further studies should evaluate precision shielding in different high-risk
jobs. For example, some data suggest that age-specific precision shielding can be successfully
achieved for health care, first response, and public safety personnel: S was 0.4 for such personnel
based on a 65 years cut-off in Detroit.42

Precision health and COVID-19
Precision approaches had received enthusiastic support before the COVID-19 era as a way to
transform medicine and health at large. Hopes (and hype)43,44 were fueled in particular by perceived
improvements in predictive ability, especially with the advent of -omics. However, the
discriminating ability of most -omics discoveries had been modest: e.g. single gene variants often
differentiated risk by less than 1.1-fold and even complex molecular signatures and multi-gene
models often differentiated risk by less than 3-fold between high- and low-risk individuals. In this

at materializing precision medicine. If the risk stratification offered by COVID-19 does not suffice
for precision purposes, then it is unlikely that the concept of precision medicine can find fruitful
applications with major impact across medicine (perhaps with the exception of some rare conditions).
At a minimum, it is worth trying to make precision approaches work for COVID-19. Even modest
shielding ratios may translate into hundreds of thousands or even millions of lives saved during the
multi-year course of the pandemic.45

* information available does not allow reliable calculation of 95% confidence intervals
The exact number of participants >=70 years tested is not provided for the studies in Iceland, Canada
and Dominical Republic, but based on the number of participants in the highest provided age stratum
and the age-structure of the population in these countries, it is likely that those >=70 would exceed
the minimum required sample of n=1000. For Iceland, the data include the cases detected with
positive PRC test (the majority) plus those estimated to be infected based on antibody testing.
ND, no data; S, shielding ratio; CI, confidence interval; fh, population >=70 years old in the location.
