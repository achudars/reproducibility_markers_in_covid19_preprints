Abstract
Background
The city of Melbourne, Australia experienced two waves of the COVID-19 epidemic
peaking, the first in March and a more substantial wave in July 2020. During the
second wave, a series of control measure were progressively introduced that initially
slowed the growth of the epidemic then resulted in decreasing cases until there was no
detectable local transmission.
Methods
To determine the relative efficacy of the progressively introduced intervention
measures, we modelled the second wave as a series of exponential growth and decay
curves. We used a linear regression of the log of daily cases vs time, using a foursegment linear spline model corresponding to implementation of the three successive
major public health measures. The primary model used all reported cases between 14
June and 15 September then compared the projection of the model with observed
cases predict future case trajectory up until the 31 October to assess the use of
exponential models in projecting the future course and planning future interventions.
The main outcome measures were the exponential daily growth constants, analysis of
residuals and estimates of the 95% confidence intervals for the expected case
distributions, comparison of predicted daily cases.
Results: The exponential growth/decay constants in the primary analysis were: 0.122
(s.e. 0.004), 0.035 (s.e. 0.005), -0.037 (s.e. 0.011 ), and -0.069 (s.e. 0.003) for the
initial growth rate, Stage 3, stage 3 + compulsory masks and Stage 4, respectively.
Extrapolation of the regression model from the 14 September to the 31 October
matched the decline in observed cases over this period.
Conclusions: The four-segment exponential model provided an excellent fit of the
observed reported case data and predicted the day-to-day range of expected cases.
The extrapolated regression accurately predicted the decline leading to epidemic
control in Melbourne.

Background
Australia experienced a rise in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in early 2020,
peaking on 28 March 2020 and then declining in April after federal and state
governments introduced strict community controls, travel bans and quarantining of
international arrivals [1]. There was a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the
Australian state of Victoria starting in June, with almost all COVID-19 cases (95%)
occurring in people living in the Victoria’s capital Melbourne and surrounding area, a
population of 4.93 million out of the total Victorian population of 6.36 million. The
resurgence led to the Victorian Government progressively introducing a series of
control measures. These measures led to an initial slowing of the growth of the
epidemic, then a rapid decline in cases and eventual local epidemic control (i.e., no
observed cases for ≥28 days). New diagnoses of COVID-19 in Melbourne peaked at
652 cases on the 4 August 2020. The last diagnosed case associated with this
resurgence was reported on the 28 October. A description of this “second wave”, and
associated control measure and outcomes has been published [1]. As determined from
the sequences of 12,320 SARS-CoV-2 isolates (collected from 1 May 2020 to 30
September 2020) submitted to the GIUSAID database, 97.7% of circulating virus was
the D.2 lineage of the GR clade.
The restrictions were primarily applied to metropolitan Melbourne and the adjoining
shire of Mitchell (hereafter “Melbourne”), although some were applied state-wide. In
Melbourne, from June to October there were five main stages of the restrictions: (1)
“pre-Stage 3” (2) “Stage 3”; (3) “Stage 3 + masks”; (4) “Stage 4”; and (5) a gradual
easing of restrictions (Table 1). These major directives were accompanied by a
vigorous testing of symptomatic people, extensive contact tracing, isolation of
infected people and quarantining of close contacts.
A previous regression analysis showed that the introduction of Stage 3 restrictions
was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the epidemic growth rate,
but it was insufficient to stop the epidemic expansion [2]. Similarly the introduction
of mandatory masks, in addition to Stage 3 restrictions, was associated with an
exponential but slow decline in cases[3]. Detailed information on the impact of the
introduction of masks, including the level of uptake of mask usage and the impact of
potentially confounding factors e.g. infections in health care workers, changed
movement patterns have been previously reported and therefore are not further

considered in this study [3]. The incremental impact of Stage 4 restrictions have not
been previously assessed. These two prior analyses considered restricted time-periods
over the epidemic wave (from 14 June to 7 July, and from 10 July to 10 August,
respectively), with a common theme being that simple exponential models provided
excellent fits to the time series of daily detected cases in the first three stages of
restrictions (i.e., linear models fitted the logarithm of daily detected cases).
In this analysis, we fit a statistical model to the combined time-series of detected
cases across the four restriction phases (pre-Stage 3; Stage 3; Stage 3 + masks and
Stage 4) to estimate and compare:
1. the incremental impact of each set of restrictions on the epidemic
growth/decline rate. This expands previous analyses by estimation of the
potential impact of Stage 4 restrictions and provides better estimates of the
epidemic growth/decline in all stages due to the use of a larger data set;
2. the utility of the exponential regression model to describe the daily ranges in
observed cases; and
3. the validity of using simple exponential model to predict future trends in daily
cases as a tool for planning interventions.
The findings of this work are of considerable interest, as to date Melbourne is one of
the few cities globally that experienced a significant outbreak of COVID-19 and then
regained control of the epidemic following the introduction of increasing government
restrictions and mask use.

Methods
Data
Daily diagnosed cases for each Local Government Area (LGA) from 25 Jan 2020 to
20 Nov 2020 were downloaded on the 21 Nov 2020 as the
NCOV_COVID_Cases_by_LGA_Source_20201120.cvs file from the Victorian
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) website [4]. Infections in people
living outside of metropolitan Melbourne or acquired overseas were excluded.

The predictive model was based on reported cases a from 14 June to 14 September
2020 inclusive, and hence covers epidemic growth/decline in four distinct phases of
restrictions: “pre-Stage 3”, “Stage 3”, “Stage 3 + masks”, and “Stage 4”.
The 14 June starting day was selected to match the previous study on the introduction
of “Stage 3” restrictions in Melbourne [2] and because the daily case numbers were
inadequate to prevent significant heteroskedasticity at earlier times. On the 14
September, a decision was made to stop the periodic updates of the model. By this
date, there was a clear downward trend in daily cases and stopping the analysis on the
14 September allowed testing the ability of the regression model to predict future
cases. The primary analysis reported in this paper (Fig. 1A) was conducted on the 14
September 2020.
Statistical model
The growth or decay rates were estimated using a non-weighted linear regression to
fit the natural logarithm of the daily cases against time, using a linear spline model
with three knots with the lspline R routine [5]. The three knots divide the model into 4
linked linear segments with the knot days (i.e., the day on which the linear segments
are “tied” together) corresponding to the times at which impact of successively
introduced control procedures are predicted to start. The knots allow deflections in
the line of best fit due to the impact of the introduction of different restrictions. The
assumption of linearity of the four segments, and hence the presumption of an
exponential growth/decay was tested by assessing whether studentized residuals were
normally distributed and independent of the time (i.e., no significant
heteroskedasticity).
Due to the generation interval for SARS-CoV-2 infection (a mean of 4-6 days [6, 7])
and delays in testing and reporting, there is an expected delay between the
introduction of restrictions and observing them in diagnosis data. The knot days were
estimated to be 8 days following the introduction of new control measures; for
example, the introduction of Stage 3 restrictions took place on 2 July, so the knot day
was 3 July + 8 days = 11 July. This delay was based on a previous study that
estimated an 8-day delay between the introduction of mandatory face masks in
Melbourne and the change in the epidemic growth rate [3].

This analysis estimated the instantaneous growth constant (k) (i.e., the slope of the
ln(daily cases) vs time regression) for each segment and the difference between these
growth constants was used as the primary measure to test for a significant association
between successive public health measures being introduced and subsequent changes
in growth/decay rates.
The doubling/halving time of the epidemic was calculated as t2 = ln(2)/k

Effective Reproduction ratio (Reff)
We calculated Reff as the ratio of new cases separated by one serial interval for SARSCoV-2 infections using the Lotka–Euler equation [8]. Due to uncertainties in the
serial interval, we estimate a range for Reff based on two measurements of the serial
interval: a normal distribution with mean 3.96, standard deviation 4.75 days based on
468 pairs of infections in China [6], and a gamma distribution with mean 6.49,
standard deviation 4.90 days based on 1015 pairs of infections in China, Japan and
Singapore [7]. We include changes in estimated Reff as a secondary estimate to allow
comparisons with other studies but emphasize that the estimates of Reff are subject to
uncertainty in estimates of the generation interval (approximated as the serial interval)
and its distribution.
We also use the change in Reff as a measure of the relative impact of successively
increasing control measures for both the 3.96 and the 6.49-day serial interval
estimates.

Extension to 31 October
To test the utility of the regression analysis to predict future trends, we extrapolated
the regression line from the last day of data fitted (14 September) to the end of
October. We calculated the predicted 95% range of daily cases in this period
assuming an inverse Poisson distribution using two methods: the estimated daily cases
calculated as the antilog of the mean ln(cases) or the mean ln(cases) ±the 95%
confidence intervals from the regression line, to provide minimum and maximum
estimates of the range, respectively.

Results
Regression analysis 14 July to 14 September2020
The regression analysis of the ln(daily cases) vs time is shown in Fig. 1A for the
model with four log-linear segments joined by three knots with each knot 8 days after
the introduction of the increased control measures (Fig. 1). For each log-linear
segment, the corresponding instantaneous growth rate, doubling/having time and Reff
are shown are shown in Table 2, alongside the percentage reduction in Reff between
segments. These growth constants translate into from a 14% daily increase in prestage 3 to a 3.3 % increase in daily cases during of Stage 3; then to a 3.5% decrease in
daily cases after introduction of mandatory masks and a further a 6.7% decrease in
Stage 4.
Over the whole of the regression, the observed daily cases were only outside the 95%
predicted confidence limits for three of the 93 days analysed. I.e., the distribution
fitted on 96% of the days as expected for a 95% confidence interval.
The 4-segment linear exponential model gave a good fit of the observed data to the
model as judged by the goodness-of fit tests detailed in the Supplementary data, but to
summarize: the distribution of studentized residual values of the log transformed
cases was indistinguishable from a normal distribution (QQ plot and Shapiro-Wilk
Test, p= 0.73). There was no significant autocorrelation (Durbin-Watson Test) and no
outlier data that significantly impacted on the regression (maximum Cook’s D value
was 0.085). However, one test that showed a deviation from an ideal regression:
there was evidence of heteroskedasticity (Breusch-Pagan test p= 0.0013, White test
p=0.0014). Inspection of the residuals indicted that the initial data points had a higher
scatter consistent with the lower daily cases in June. A regression using three
segments with two knots for the period 11 July to 14 September (i.e., starting at the
day of the first expected impact of Stage 3) gave a fit with no significant
heteroskedasticity and the growth constants for the stage 3, stage 3+masks and stage 4
were essentially unchanged from those obtained with the full model (Table 2). Thus,
the observed heteroskedasticity at in the start of the first segment had no impact on
the estimates of growth constants for stage 3, stage 3+masks or Stage 4.
Extrapolation to the 31 October 2020

The observed distribution of cases over the period 15 September to 31 October
closely matched the projected distribution, with most cases lying within the 95%
confidence intervals. Importantly, this projection showed a high probability of zero
cases at the end of October (31% probability of zero cases on the 31 October). Since
the confidence interval for the regression line was small compared to the Poisson
confidence intervals, there was little difference in the confidence interval calculated
with the two methods based on the mean or the mean ± 95% confidence interval.

Discussion
From 14 June to 14 September, the four-segment linear model gave a good fit to the
observed daily cases in Melbourne. There was a highly significant change in the
growth constants (and associated Reff) following the three major changes in control
measures. The biggest successive impact as measured by the successive percent
change in Reff, was the addition of masks to the existing Stage 3 restrictions, followed
by increased restrictions at the start Stage 3 , regardless of the underlying assumptions
about serial interval (Table 2).
Although introduction of masks had the largest effect, the addition of further
restrictions at the start of Stage 4 still was associated with a statistically significant
change in the growth constant. Without Stage 4, the extrapolated trend predicted 18
new cases per day on the 31 October compared to the 1.2 cases predicted with the
additional Stage 4 restrictions. Alternatively, it would have taken until the 15
January to reach an average of 1.2 cases per day. Also, the addition of Stage 4 is
estimated to have prevented approximately 3900 cases compared to continued use of
just Stage 3 + masks until local epidemic control.
Growth constants and associated Reff had previously been reported using regression
analyses for the initial growth period and Stage 3 for all cases in Victoria [2, 3] and
for Stage 3 with and without masks for Melbourne cases [3]. The analyses in this
paper used a wider range of data and importantly, included the additional Stage 4
restrictions: The first study fitted the data to two independent linear regression lines of
the ln(daily cases) vs time and the second to a model with two linear segments and a
single knot. As a result of the larger database and by constraining the end of each
segment through the use of the knots, the precision of the estimates are improved as

judged by the smaller standard errors of the estimated growth constants in the current
study compared to the earlier studies (Table 3).
As previously noted, earlier work considered a range of possible confounding factors
that might change the estimated growth rates in the Stage 3 to Stage 3 + Masks
transition [3], including the impact of COVID-19 cases on testing patterns, infections
in health care workers and the impact of changed (reduced) movement patterns. None
of the potential confounding factors had a significant impact on the estimated changes
in the growth constant going from Stage 3 to Stage 3 + Masks and were not
considered in this broader study. However, as concluded in the previous work,
although no statistically significant impact was observed, these confounding factors
were likely to result in an under-estimate of the impact of each of the increased
restrictions. For example, health care workers were already using masks and other
PPE over the whole period.
Our results have several implications for real time control decisions to guide the
future imposition or relaxation of control measures. These include:
1. Managing community expectation in the fluctuations of observed daily cases.
The power of the statistics associated with a regression analysis provides an
estimate of the expected daily range. As shown in Fig 1, this analysis
accurately predicted the range of daily cases expected (i.e., for the main
analysis period, for 90 out of 93 days (96%), the observed distribution lay
within the 95% estimated range). It will give a short-term estimate of
expected range. If applied in future outbreaks may give either reassurance or a
rapid warning that the epidemic situation is changing.
2. Longer term prediction of future trends. Extrapolation of the regression
analysis from the 14 September to the 31 October correctly predicted the trend
of the epidemic. This approach differs from the 14-day rolling average
approach used in Victoria to provide Go/No Go decision on relaxing controls
[1]. Because the regression analysis is based on all available data and built
around a statistical model, it can be projected into the future with realistic
confidence ranges. The rolling average is based on much less data (14 days)
and is subject to greater variation (Fig. 1B) and gives an historical view on
where the epidemic was on average 7 days previously. It cannot provide

estimates of the expected daily fluctuations in case number or a statistical
basis including confidence ranges on predicting future cases.
3. Quantitative data on the impact of progressively imposed control measures.
As judged by Reff, this study highlights that the single most important
sequential control measure was the addition of mandatory masks. The much
more stringent control measures subsequently imposed with Stage 4 had a
significant but smaller impact on the time to epidemic control but at a much
greater cost to the community. If future, with a much smaller outbreak, Stage
3 + masks alone may be sufficient. Alternatively, if faced with a more highly
transmissible strain [9] the data from this study may be useful in calibrating
future models of what will be required for local epidemic control.

Conclusions
A simple and easily calculated linear regression model with knots at each significant
change in control measures, gave an adequate fit to the observed daily cases in
Melbourne’s second COVID-19 wave, providing quantitative data on the relatively
impact of the different controls and provides a framework for simple models to guide
future outbreaks responses should this be required.
