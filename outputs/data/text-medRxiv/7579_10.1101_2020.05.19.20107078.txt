ABSTRACT
Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps to cope with negative emotions and
learn from experience. The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to
widespread social isolation. Does dreaming change and/or reflect mental suffering? To address
these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports from
67 individuals either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, when quarantine
was imposed in Brazil following the pandemic announcement by the WHO. Pandemic dreams
showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words, and higher average semantic similarities
to the terms “contamination” and “cleanness”. These features were associated with mental
suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative
subscale (p=0.0092). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect
mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits.

The relationship between dreams and fear has long been expressed across different
cultures, since the dawn of civilization 1. What ancient cultures interpreted as divine advice has
now been hypothesized as a memory mechanism to metabolize negative emotions and learn from
experience, preparing individuals for the challenges in everyday life 2. We have been facing a
global threat at the moment - the COVID-19 pandemic - and new strategies to overcome this
danger have been proposed, such as social isolation. This affects people's lives in different ways,
from the reassessment of economic perspectives to the effort to maintain safe and meaningful
relationships. How can dreams reflect our inner suffering and even mitigate or create solutions
for our challenges?
There has been an intense academic debate about the function of dreams and the underlying
brain mechanisms

3,4.

One issue in such debate is how episodic memories (memories of lived

experiences) are manifested during dreaming 5-9. A related question is whether threatening events
- such as the pandemic spread of a virus - can influence people's dreaming patterns. For individual
trauma, the role of dreaming is already recognized, and recurrent dreams depicting threatening
situations are an important sign in the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder

10-16.

However,

the scenario is far less clear when it comes to collective trauma, such as the one we have been
experiencing with COVID-19.
Like an episodic memory, the concept of 'day-residue', which became central to Freud's
psychoanalytic theory and therapy

17,

refers to elements experienced during the previous days,

which can be identified once dreams are carefully scrutinized. Although it seems to be irrefutable
today that the waking life is part of dreaming, recent studies have shown that only isolated spatial
and temporal fragments of episodic memory are present in dreams

3,10,11.

However, when

traumatic experiences are at stake, dream imagery can get highly episodic. One explanation is
that when something out of the ordinary happens — like a pandemic — our brains may process
the experience through dreaming. Episodic fragments (such as characters and settings), as well
as semantic information, are brought together over time, maintaining a sense of first-person and
continuous present perspective.
Dream reports collected after the 9/11 attacks show that many New Yorkers reported dreams
of being overwhelmed by a tidal wave or being attacked and robbed

12.

According to the authors

of that study, dreams are thought to be the brain’s way of working out our emotional problems,
and the more anxious we become in waking life, the more vivid our dream images seem to
become.
Barrett et al. examined the dream contents produced by British officers held in a Nazi
camp for prisoners of war (POW) between 1940–1942

13.

These POW dreams showed more

content concerning battles, imprisonment, escape, and food than the male norms from the same
era. Not much of any type of social interaction was detected in the POW dream reports, with less
friendliness, sexuality, and even less aggression than the male norms. However, aggression was
unusually extreme when it occurred, and its content was linked to previous battles rather than
camp life. POW's had less good fortune or misfortune in their dreams along with frequent bland
dreams about the camp’s tedium.

Dream reports produced by German civilians during the Nazi regime were extremely
bland, and the author's main conclusion was that the oppressive environment was so extreme as
to repress even dreams

16.

One caveat is that most data about dreams collected during

confinement or obtained from former war combatants have been gathered only after the person
is away from the arena of combat 12. Studies of dream reports during extended confinement, like
the present one, are scarce and called for.
The subjective nature of dreams challenges its scientific investigation, just like psychiatric
evaluation. How to precisely characterize aspects from oral reports that in human contact we can
describe with words, just like the specialist evaluation of human behavior in a psychiatric
interview? To overcome this problem and allow an objective metric of content and structural
analysis of oral reports, natural language processing tools have been applied with success in the
field of psychometric evaluation

18-25.

Structural analysis applying graph representation of word

trajectory reveals mental disorganization related to negative symptoms in schizophrenia, allowing
an automated diagnosis with more than 90% accuracy in different disorder stages and different
languages 19-21,24,26.
Interestingly, dream reports seem to contain the most revealing content yielding this
precise discrimination of schizophrenia diagnosis 19,21. The estimation of semantic similarity based
on the co-occurrence of terms in a large corpus has enabled the identification of substance use
and dose by calculating semantic similarity between experience oral reports and probe words
related to psychotropic substances like methamphetamine

23.

To conclude, estimation of the

proportion of affective words with positive or negative valence has been useful to identify mood
disorders such as bipolar disorder, also using dream reports

27.

It also predicts the response of

psilocybin treatment for resistant depression 28.
More than just tracking signs of mental suffering, could the observation of dreams help
us understand personal challenges and mitigate suffering? Blagrove and collaborators proposed
that dreams sharing has an empathic effect on the dreamer and on significant others engaged in
a dream telling situation29. Trait empathy was found to be significantly associated with the
frequency of listening to the dreams of others, frequency of telling one’s dreams to others, and
attitude toward dreams. Moreover, the dream-discusser state of empathy towards the dreamsharer was found to increase significantly as a result of the dream discussion, with medium effect
size, whereas the dream-sharer presented a small decrease in empathy towards the dreamdiscusser. Based on these results, the authors suggest that dreams act as a piece of fiction that
can be explored by the dreamer together with other people, inducing, thus, empathy about the
life circumstances of the dreamer. They also speculate that the story-like characteristics of adult
human dreams may have been positively selected during human evolution as part of the selection
for emotional intelligence, empathy, and social bonding.
Here we aim to use natural language processing tools to investigate the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic in dream experience, testing the following hypotheses: 1. The content and
structure of pandemic dream reports are different from the same features obtained from dream
reports collected before the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and these peculiarities evolve; 2. The

RESULTS

We followed 42 participants just after the pandemic announcement by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and during the first month of social isolation in Brazil (March 12 – April 21),
collecting oral dream reports through a smartphone application designed to gather audio data
collection files for mental health monitoring. From this sample, 11 participants reported the use of
psychotropic medication and mental health diagnoses related to mood and anxiety disorders
(Figure 1B). Those participants were analyzed separately. A group of 31 healthy participants
without mental health diagnosis and free from any psychotropic medication was analyzed. Five
of them (and one participant that were using psychotropic medication during the pandemic period
but were not before COVID-19) had already used the same smartphone application before the
existence of COVID-19. These 6 participants plus 25 healthy participants that also used the
smartphone application before the COVID-19 pandemic, composed a paired control group to be
compared with the pandemic group (Figure 1B). These six participants' dream reports are
presented as illustrative examples for content analysis in Figure 1C.

Comparison between Pandemic x Control Dreams and the longitudinal observation:

The structural analysis did not differ between pandemic dreams and controls: despite
pandemic dreams presenting a higher amount of words in general, no difference was found
regarding word connectedness (Figure 2A, Table 2).
Although structure seems to be preserved, emotional and semantic content revealed
peculiarities: the proportion of anger and sadness-related words was higher for pandemic dreams.
Semantic similarities to the terms “contamination” and “cleanness” were also higher (Figure 2B
and C, Table 2). No difference was found for the proportion of positive emotions, negative
emotions, or anxiety-related words, neither for semantic similarities to the terms “sickness”,
“health”, “death” or “life” (Figure 2B and C, Table 2).
The analyses of connectedness and word proportion are already controlled for word count
(see Methods), but semantic similarities might be impacted by the higher amount of words in
pandemic dreams. For that reason, we verified Spearman correlations between word count and
semantic similarities and no correlation was significant (Table 2).
Consecutively, we verified whether the pandemic dreams peculiarities increase or
decrease over time, during the dream observation period. To do so, Spearman correlations with
the time of dream observation was performed. The semantic similarity to the term “cleanness”

Association with mental suffering:
Pandemic dreams peculiarities such as the proportion of anger or sadness related words,
or semantic similarities to “contamination” and “cleanness” were combined and correlated with
the scores from PANSS (a psychometric scale that evaluate positive symptoms linked to
psychosis such as hallucinations and delusions; negative symptoms linked to social isolation and
cognitive impairment; and a general subscale linked to unspecific mental suffering such as mood
and anxiety symptoms, using canonical regression (Figure 3). We found a significant correlation
between the combination of dream content peculiarities and mental suffering (Figure 3A). PANSS
negative subscale and semantic similarity to the term "cleanness" contributed with higher
coefficients to the canonical correlation, and both co-varied in the same direction (the higher the
semantic similarities to “cleanness” in the dream report, the higher the severity of negative
subscales in PANSS (Figure 3B). This result was confirmed by multi-linear correlation between
the combination of pandemic dreams peculiarities and PANSS negative subscale or mental
suffering related to social isolation (R2 = 0.39, p=0.0092, Coefficients: 1.3 Anger proportion + (0.043) Sadness proportion + 18 “Contamination” similarity + 984.79 “Cleanness” similarity + 7.7).
In other words, pandemic dreams peculiarities explained 39% of PANSS negative subscale

variation. To better understand which items were particularly related to the similarity to
“cleanness”, we calculated the canonical correlation between all 7 items of PANSS negative
subscale and the semantic similarity to the term “cleanness” (Figure 3C). We found that most of
the variance of this correlation was due to the co-variance between the semantic similarity of
dream reports to the term “cleanness” and the items N3 of PANSS negative subscale (Poor
Rapport), with a smaller contribution in the same direction of the item N4 (Passive Social
Withdrawal), and in the opposite direction of the item N6 (Lack of Spontaneity on Talking). In
other words, the more similar to cleanness the dream report was, the higher the severity of poor
rapport, passive social withdrawal, and higher spontaneity on talking during the interview.
We performed the same multilinear correlation analysis for a group of participants under
psychotropic medication that self-reported mood and/or anxiety disorder. No significant
correlation was found between peculiarities of pandemic dreams and psychometric evaluation,
perhaps because the sample size was too small to reach a significant level (Total PANSS: R 2 =
0.30, p=0.8458, Positive Subscale: R2 = 0.68, p=0.3675, Negative Subscale: R2 = 0.26, p=0.8843,
General Subscale: R2 = 0.19, p=0.9369). Interestingly, however, the association with the positive
subscale was the strongest found, a different pattern than for the group with no mental disorder
diagnosis.

Association with the affective impact of dream observation (self-evaluation scale):

To verify a potential affective impact of the dream observation process, at the end of the
data collection we applied a self-evaluation questionnaire, in which participants rated, using a 1
to 10 scale, to which extent the dream observation experience increased their states of being
happy/sad,

calm/anxious,

energetic/tired,

peaceful/aggressive,

altruistic/selfish,

and

creative/confused. We constituted pairs of positive/negative subjective evaluations. First, we
compared the scores assigned, in order to verify how participants self-evaluated the dreamobservation experience in positive and negative terms. We found higher positive evaluation for
almost all the pairs of subjective impact analyzed (more happy than sad, more energetic than
tired, more peaceful than aggressive, more altruistic than selfish, and more creative than
confused) (Figure 4A). There was no difference between calm and anxious (Figure 4A). We then
correlated all pandemic dreams peculiarities to the positive and the negative self-evaluated
aspects and a significant canonical correlation to negative aspects of dream observation was
found (Figure 4B). Also, while analyzing canonical coefficients, we noticed that most of the
correlation variance is explained by the co-variance of the semantic similarity to the term
“contamination” with the scores on the self-evaluation for aggressiveness (i.e., the more similar
to contamination the semantic content of the dream report, the higher the feeling of being
aggressive, or selfishness and self-confusion) (Figure 4C). However, the higher the similarity to
“cleanness”, the lower the scores for aggressiveness, selfishness or self-confusion, and a higher
effect of anxiety) (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION
The results are in accord with the hypothesis that dreams from the pandemic period
reflect negative emotions such as anger and sadness and similarity to “contamination” and
“cleanness”. This seems to show in dream content all different sources of fear and frustration to
this global challenge. Economic fears, social distancing from relatives, friends, and peers, and
uncertainties on future planning are possible explanations for the above-reported changes on
dream content and the increase of mental suffering.

10

Besides, pandemic dreams reflect changes in habits, more than worries related to greater
impacts or tragic ends in people's lives. There is a great similarity to daily concerns, with concrete
changes in habits (related to contamination and cleanness), which tends to increase during the
follow-up. Those are changes that are globally discussed and adopted

30.

Nevertheless, disease

and fear of death, during the first month of observation, were not concretely faced as a challenge
for most of the participants (only one individual had confirmed the disease during the follow-up
and another had a close relative with confirmed infection). Maybe this result could be different in
another time point, or if sickness and death concretely appeared as a reality in sample majority.
But what concretely affected the daily routine of individuals, the change of habits, and fear of
contamination was tracked by the higher similarity to these terms.
Although this sample did not experience an individual severe trauma by fear of death or
grief of losing a beloved person or a job, the change, in reality, was already enough for some
individuals to experience mental suffering throughout this ongoing pandemic period. Moreover,
the combination of dream content changes (higher proportion of anger and sadness combined
with higher semantic similarity to “contamination” and “cleanness”) was significantly correlated
with mental suffering related to aspects of social isolation, reflecting 39% of PANSS negative
subscale variance. Even though this psychometric scale has been designed to quantify the
severity of negative symptoms related to psychosis, the mental suffering associated with poor
rapport and passive social withdraw, combined with more fluency while talking during the
interview was associated with higher similarity to the term “cleanness”. Changes in dream content
seem to reflect mental suffering similar to what happens with patients experiencing harsh changes
in reality at a psychotic break. Not that this suffering was severe to the point of being considered
pathological, but, as reality during a pandemic period seems too threatening, dream contents
reflect this modulation, capturing this quality of suffering from the loss of social interaction.
Interestingly, a subsample of individuals with a diagnosis of mood and/or anxiety disorder
did not show the same level of significant association with the same class of symptoms. Although
the sample size of this group is too small to be conclusive, R-squares seem to indicate that there
might be a real association, emphasizing the importance of increasing the sample size.
Furthermore, psychotropic medications have a major impact on dreaming

31,32.

Importantly, changes in structural language analysis were not observed. Those changes
have been associated with cognitive impairments in psychosis or during development, being,
thus, a deep effect, not expected to be found in scenarios like the one under analysis. Also, during
the pandemic period, dream reports were longer, wordier. This may indicate that humans are
paying more attention to dream experiences at the current moment. It might as well suggest an
increase in the ability to remember dreams details due to the possibility of staying in bed after
waking, during the quarantine, although this factor did not interact with other results (correlations
were not significant).

Moreover, observing dreams were more positively evaluated. This result may indicate a
relatively safe way for self-observation and mental health management that can be oriented
during this period of reality uncertainties 29. The simple act of observing and reporting dreams can
have a positive impact on mental health. Also, dream reports peculiarities can signal the need to
be cautious: on one hand, the more similar dreams were to the term “contamination”, the more
people reported being aggressive, selfish, or confused after dream observation. On the other
hand, the more similar the dreams were to the term “cleanness”, the higher the feeling of being
anxious after dream observation. Dream observation seems, thus, informative about mental
health issues, showing different perspectives of self-evaluation.
This study has several limitations such as a small sample size, without representative
diversity related to gender balance, age, or educational level. Although this might impede
generalizing the obtained result to the global population, it does suggest a relatively simple and
safe manner to track mental suffering during periods of forced social isolation. Larger studies in
diverse samples should light our understanding of dreams as a reflector of inner suffering and
fears. It might as well help us identify early signs of mental issues, being thus part of the
prevention of severe mental impact.
In conclusion, our results support the theory that dreams reflect daily changes during this
critical period of our lives, associated with mental suffering. Observing and reporting dreams,
thus, may help individuals to overcome this challenge, flagging feelings such as anxiety and
sadness.

METHODS

Participants:
To address the 3 hypotheses formulated we followed 42 participants during the initials days of
lockdown in Brazil after the announcement of COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health
Organization WHO (from March 12th to April 21st), according to each participant location (Figure
1B and Table 1). As eleven of them reported continuous use of psychotropic medication and
mental health diagnosis, we analyzed their data separately (Figure 1B). Then we constituted a
control group of 31 participants pared to the 31 participants free from mental health diagnosis
(Figure 1B and Table 1). All the control participants were also free from mental health symptoms,
diagnosis, or psychotropic medication. They used the same method to collect dream reports
remotely before the existence of the COVID-19 virus (using a customized smartphone application
designed for access to memory oral reports to track for mental health suffering signs). Six of the
31 participants of the control group could also participate in this pandemic period of data collection
(Figure 1B), and these 6 paired examples of changes in dream reports are shown in Figure 1C.
Mean and standard deviation of age and educational level are summarized in Table 1, as well as

the sex distribution. All the participants agreed to participate and signed informed consent. The
study was approved by the UFRN Research Ethics Committee (permit # 3.613.186).
Protocol:
Before the Pandemic period, the participants were invited to test a smartphone application
designed to remotely collect oral memory reports to be used for remote mental health tracking
during September to November 2019. The application prompted a request to report a dream that
had to have at least 30 seconds to keep the flow of memory reports. In sequence, the application
requested a report from the previous day and prompted 3 images to then request to tell a story
based on that picture. All the audio files were already and safely transferred to the university
server and researchers transcribed all the audios into text files. For this study, we focused on the
dream reports memory, to compare it to pandemic dream reports. The other memory reports were
not considered. A total of 31 dream reports from this period well before the COVID-19 Pandemic
were generated.
During the Pandemic period, the participants had to initially answer an online survey related to
general information like sex, age, educational level, family income, sleep pattern, and mental
health diagnosis and/or medication in use. They were instructed to daily record their dreams in
an audio file (using the smartphone application designed for scientific purposes or other online
resources that were available) and share it with the researcher to transcribe it to text files. A total
of 208 dream reports from this period (first month of COVID-19 Pandemic) were generated and
averaged per subject to compare with pared controls.
At the end of this observation period, a trained psychiatrist applied the PANSS scale to measure
the severity of mental suffering related to this pandemic period. This scale is divided into 3
subscales and the major focus is on psychosis. The first sub-scale is composed by 7 questions
and called as the positive symptoms scale, that focus on symptoms such as delusions and
hallucinations; the second is also composed by 7 questions and is called the negative sub-scale,
and related to symptoms associated with social withdraw, isolation, cognitive impairment, and
recursive thinking. And the last sub-scale is composed of 16 general questions related to mood
and anxiety symptoms such as tension, depression, panic attacks, time/space orientation, or lack
of judgment. All questions are graded from 1 to 7.
To conclude, we applied a final online survey related to the self-evaluation of the subjective impact
of dream observation during this period. The scale requested the participants to grade from 1 to
10 to how the dream observation experience made them: happy, sad, anxious, calm, energetic,
tired, peaceful, aggressive, altruistic, selfish, creative, or confuse.
Text Analysis:
After the transcription of all the words on dream reports, we performed 3 different computational
language analysis using different strategies:

Structural Analysis using SpeechGraphs software

20:

for this analysis, each word in the text file

was considered as a node and the temporal sequence between words were represented as
directed edges. Here we focused on the total word count (WC) and connectedness attributes
(LCC – the number of nodes in the largest connected component and LSC – the number of nodes
in the largest strongly connected component) as these attributes were the ones most associated
with mental health disorder (such as Schizophrenia

19-21,24).

As there was no maximum limit for

an oral report of a dream, to control for word count differences, we performed graphs of 30 words,
using a step of one word to perform the next graph 20. Then, we calculate the LCC and LSC of all
30 word-graphs and average all LCCs and LSCs from the same reports.
The proportion of words using LIWC with Brazilian Portuguese Dictionary: we used the LIWC
software

33

that searches and classify words in the dream reports according to a validated

Brazilian Portuguese Dictionary

34

to find words with emotional content (positive emotions,

negative emotions, anxiety, anger, and sadness related words). The software returns the
proportion of words with the specific content in the dream report. As it is already a proportion, the
result is controlled by word count differences.
Semantic similarity using customized software to perform Fast text method in Python: In order to
investigate how the dream content must reflect pandemic related concerns or change of daily
habits, we estimated the semantic similarity of dream reports to the probe words (“contamination”,
“cleanness”, “sickness”, “health”, “death”, “life”). We did this using word embedding techniques.
Word embedding is based on the distributional hypothesis, which states that semantically similar
words tend to appear in similar contexts

35.

Given that the reports were in Portuguese, we used

the Fast text pre-trained multilingual word embedding

36,37.

This model is built using a sliding

window of predefined length that moves along a Portuguese Wikipedia corpus. At each step, a
neural network is trained to predict the central word from the context, that is, from the other words
in the window. Once the neural network is trained, a vector representation for each word in the
corpus is extracted from the input and output layers of the model, which is used as the word
embedding. The original text files were transformed to lowercase, word-tokenized, and cleared
from non-alphabetic tokens and stop-words (using nltk Portuguese stop-word list

38).

Then, for

each text file, we calculated the semantic similarity of each word to the probe words by calculating
the cosine between the word and the probe word. To control for the possible difference in word
count and also to refine the results for only the most related words to the probe terms, we
considered to the final average similarity only those words that reached the threshold of 0.3 (the
maximum similarity is 1). All the words that reached at least this threshold were considered and
averaged to compose a final semantic similarity of the dream report to the probe words.
So, the semantic similarity of a dream report to a probe word was calculated as the average
similarity of all the words on dream reports that reached the minimum similarity of 0.3 to the probe
word. Semantic similarity between a word (v1) to a probe word (v2) is the cosine between these
two vectors:

where |v2| refers to the probe words (“contamination”, “cleanness”, “sickness”, “health”, “death”,
“life”) and |v1 to N| refers to the all the words on dream reports that presented at least a similarity
of 0.3 to the probe word considered.

Statistical analysis:
To address the first hypothesis, we compared the dream reports produced during the COVID-19
pandemic period (Pandemic Dreams) to dream reports produced before the existence of the
COVID-19 virus. For that, we average all dream reports from the same participant produced
during the pandemic period, to have only one data point for each participant. As the data was not
normally distributed (all the text analyses were tested for normality distribution using the
Kolmogorov Smirnoff test and all p values were lower than 0.0001), we used a nonparametric test
Wilcoxon Ranksum. We stratified the analysis as structural analysis (3 attributes: WC, LCC, and
LSC), the proportion of emotional content analysis (5 attributes: positive emotions, negative
emotions, anxiety, anger, and sadness related words) and semantic similarity analysis to 6 probe
words (“contamination”, “cleanness”, “sickness”, “health”, “death”, “life”). We corrected for multiple
comparisons considering each analysis, so we considered significant results of p-value lower than
0.0167 for structural analysis, 0.0100 for the proportion of emotional analysis, and lower than
0.0083 for semantic similarity to probe words.
For the longitudinal analysis, we correlated only the dream peculiarities found on the previous
comparison and correlated to the time of dream observation counted in days. As we found 5
attributes, we corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method and considered
difference p values lower than 0.0100.
To investigate the association to mental suffering, we combined and correlated all the pandemic
dream content differences found to the PANSS sub-scales (positive, negative and general) using
canonical correlation, and confirmed the result by performing a multi-linear correlation between
the PANSS subscale with the higher canonical coefficient with the pandemic dreams variables.
To better understand which symptoms were leading the correlations, we performed a canonical
correlation between all questions in the PANSS subscale and the pandemic dreams variable that
showed the higher canonical coefficient. To study the group of individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis and under medication, we performed only the multi-linear correlation (to avoid
overfitting combining multiple variables as this group was too small).
To investigate how the experience of dream observation was self-evaluated with the dream
reports peculiarities, we first compared 6 positive aspects of this questionnaire with 6 paired
negative aspects of this scale, correcting the results for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni
method (considering significant p < 0.0083). In sequence, we correlated the positive and the
