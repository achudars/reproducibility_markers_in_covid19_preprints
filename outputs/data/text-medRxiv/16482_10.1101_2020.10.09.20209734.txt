ABSTRACT
Background: Studies show that having some symptoms seems to be associated with more
severe disease and poor prognosis. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic
COVID-19 disease is important to provide targeted preventive and management practice. The
aim of the study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic disease among COVID19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
Methods: A case-control study was conducted from August to September 2020 among a
randomly selected 765 COVID-19 patients (372 Asymptomatic and 393 Symptomatic patients).
Chi-square test and independent t-test were used to detect the presence of a statistically
significant difference in the characteristics of the cases (symptomatic) and controls
(asymptomatic), where p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant
difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant
association between the independent variables and developing symptomatic COVID-19 where
Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance
and interpretation of results.
Results: The result of the multivariable binary logistic regression shows that age group (AOR=
1.818, 95% CI= 1.210, 2.731, p-value=0.004 for 30-39 years; AOR= 1.611, 95% CI= 1.016,
2.554, p-value=0.043 for 40-49 years and AOR= 4.076, 95% CI= 2.582, 6.435, p-value=0.0001
for years and above), sex (AOR= 1.672, 95% CI= 1.216, 2.299, p-value=0.002) and history of
diabetes mellitus (AOR= 2.406, 95% CI= 1.384, 4.181, p-value=0.002) were found to be
significant factors that determine the development of symptomatic disease in COVID-19
patients.

Conclusions: Developing a symptomatic COVID-19 disease was found to be determined by
exposures of old age, male sex, and being diabetic. Therefore, patients with the above factors
should be given enough attention in the prevention and management process, including inpatient
management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have
a favorable treatment outcome.

INTRODUCTION
The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a virus in the coronaviruses family
called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in
China in December 2019 and declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization in
March 20201.
Till today, there is no such pathognomonic feature identified for the disease presentation. But
according to studies, the COVID-19 disease could present with different symptoms and signs.
Regarding the spectrum of symptoms, studies show that the presentation spectrum could range
from having no symptoms at all while being infected (asymptomatic cases) to different types of
one or more symptoms. Respiratory and constitutional symptoms are reported to be the
commonest presentation in most setups2-4.
Also, atypical presentations like hyposmia, hypogeusia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sputum,
cerebrovascular accidents, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are reported. These atypical
symptoms are reported to be observed in the majority of patients in a study conducted in Europe
but only in few patients in the United States making it difficult to generalize these symptoms as
atypical for all setups 2-8.
Studies about what determines becoming symptomatic are lacking but different studies and
reports point that acquiring the disease, developing symptomatic infection, having severe disease
and bad prognosis shows a difference in terms of sex showing that the male sex is more
vulnerable to worse conditions. Different explanations are given starting from the genetic level
up to behavioral factors that could cause men to be more susceptible to the disease 9-15.
Studies including the ones conducted in our center showed that having some symptoms seems to
be associated with more severe disease and poor prognosis rather than other symptoms or have
no symptoms at all. Therefore, knowing who is more susceptible to symptomatic COVID-19
disease is important to provide a better preventive practice and stratified patient management and
follow up. But there is no such study conducted in the study area.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the determinants of having symptomatic
disease among COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study setting and period
The study was conducted at Millennium COVID-19 Care Center (MCCC), a makeshift hospital
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Study Design
Institution based case-control study design was employed.
Source and Study Population
The source population was all patients admitted to MCCC with a confirmed diagnosis of
COVID-19 using RT-PCR by a laboratory given mandate to test such patients by the Ethiopian
Federal Ministry of Health16.
-

-

Case (symptomatic): all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the MCCC
and who presented with one or more symptoms at admission and during the clinical
course of the disease.
Control (asymptomatic): all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the
MCCC and who did not have any symptoms during the clinical course of the disease.

The study population was all selected COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up
at MCCC and who full fill the inclusion criteria.
Sample Size Determination and Sampling Technique
The sample size was determined using sample size calculation for a case-control study with the
following assumptions; 95% confidence interval, power of 90%, one to one ratio of cases and
controls, the proportion of males who are symptomatic as 0.85, and proportion of females who
are asymptomatic as 0.75 and considering a non-response rate of 10%. Therefore, the total
sample size calculated becomes 778 cases of COVID-19 (389 symptomatic and 389
asymptomatic).
To select both the cases and the controls, simple random sampling method was used.
Eligibility criteria
All COVID-19 patients who were on treatment and follow up at MCCC and whose clinical
history regarding presenting symptom and symptoms developed during the clinical course of the
disease is well documented were included.

Operational Definition
Asymptomatic patient: any patient who has tested positive for COVID-19 but does not have
any symptoms. These patients are detected after isolation and contact tracing as done by
Ethiopian Public Health Institute 16.
Data Collection Procedures and Quality Assurance
A data abstraction tool to pick all the relevant variables was drafted based on the patient
registration and follow-up form and then pretested on 5% of randomly selected charts which
were not included in the final data collection. The final data abstraction tool was then developed
after modification based on the pretest. Data was collected by six trained General practitioners.
Data consistency and completeness were checked before an attempt was made to enter the code
and analyze the data.
Data Management and Analysis
The extracted data were coded, entered into Epi-Info version 7.2.1.0, cleaned, stored, and
exported to SPSS version 25.0 software for analysis. Categorical covariates were summarized
using frequencies and percentages and numerical variables were summarized with a mean value.
A chi-square test (Fischer’s exact test for those variables that do not meet the chi-square test
assumptions) and an independent t-test were run to determine the presence of a significant
difference between the independent variables and the developmentof symptom. The assumptions
of the chi-square test, that no cell should have an expected frequency of less than 5, and the
assumptions of t-test, normal distribution, and equality of variance, were checked before the
analysis, and all assumptions were met. A statistically significant difference was detected for
variables with a P-value of ≤ 0.05.
The association between the dependent variable and independent variables was analyzed using
multivariable Binary Logistic Regression. Univariate analysis was done at a 25% level of
significance to screen out independent variables used in the multiple Binary Logistic regression
model. The adequacy of the final model was assessed using the Hosmer and Lemeshow
goodness of fit test and the final model fitted the data well (x2(7)=6.298 and p-value = 0.505). For
the Binary Logistic regression, a 95% confidence interval for AOR was calculated and variables
with p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered as statistically associated with the development of
symptoms (Symptomatic Vs Asymptomatic).
RESULT
Socio–demographic, co-morbid illness and disease related variables and comparison
between Symptomatic Vs Asymptomatic
From the 778 charts, information was collected from 765 charts making the response rate 98.3%.
The majorities (25.9%) of the patients involved in the study were in the two extreme age groups,

< 30 years (33.9%) and ≥ 50 years (26.3%). Four hundred fifty (56.8%) were males. Close to one
third (29.8%) of the patients had a history of one or more pre-existing co-morbid illness. The
majority had hypertension (16.6%), diabetes mellitus (11.9%), cardiac disease (3.7%), and
Asthma (3.4%). One hundred forty-four (18.8%) patients needed oxygen therapy.
Based on the chi-square/ Fischer’s exact test result, a significant difference in the presence of
symptom was found among the different age groups, sex, different COVID-19 severity, those
with a history of pre-existing co-morbid illness, cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
asthma and the need of oxygen supplement.
Accordingly, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the age group of < 30 years were
asymptomatic (66.5 % Vs 33.5%, p-value=0.0001). On the other hand for the rest of the three
age groups, a significantly higher proportion of patients were symptomatic. The majority of
females were asymptomatic (55.9% Vs 44.1%, p-value=0.001) and males were symptomatic
(43.6% Vs 56.4%, p-value=0.001). A greater proportion of moderate (83.3% Vs 16.7%, pvalue=0.0001) and severe (96.8% Vs 24.4%, p-value=0.0001) patients were symptomatic and the
mild patients were asymptomatic (83.4% Vs 16.6%, p-value=0.0001). The majority of patients
with pre-existing co-morbid illness (71.1% Vs 28.9%, p-value=0.0001) were symptomatic.
Similarly, patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were symptomatic
compared with those patients with no such illness. Those who needed oxygen therapy (97.2% Vs
2.8%, p-value=0.0001) were symptomatic compared to those who was on room air. (Table 1)

Based on the results of the independent t-test, symptomatic patients were relatively tachypnic
(19.9/min Vs 23.2/min, p-value=0.0001) and have lower oxygen saturation (95.6% Vs 93.7%, pvalue=0.0001). In addition, the symptomatic patients had a neutrophil predominant cell count
(78.3% Vs 57.7%, p-value=0.005)
Symptomatic patients have a significantly raised urea (22.9 mg/dl Vs 35.7 mg/dl, p-value=0.027)
and alanine transaminase (21.6 IU/L Vs 49.9 IU/L, p-value=0.005). On the other raised aspartate
transaminase was seen in the asymptomatic patients (53.9 IU/L Vs 44.9%, p-value=0.007).

Factors associated with the presence of symptom in COVID-19 patients
Univariate analysis at 25% level of significance was conducted and age group, sex, hypertension,
and diabetes mellitus history were found to be significantly associated with the development of
symptoms.
On the multivariable binary logistic regression, age group, sex, and diabetes mellitus were found
to be significantly associated with the development of symptoms at 5% level of significance.
Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of developing symptomatic disease
was more likely among patients in the age range of 30 years and above compared with those

DISCUSSION
This study has tried to assess the determinants of developing symptomatic COVID-19 disease
among RT-PCR confirmed patients admitted at MCCC. The chi-square test result of the study
shows that a significant difference in having symptomatic Vs asymptomatic infection is observed
in some of the variables showing that symptomatic disease is significantly associated with old
age, male sex, having moderate and severe disease, having one or more co-morbid illness and
requiring oxygen therapy. Based on the t-test, symptomatic infection is significantly associated

with a relatively higher respiratory rate, lower oxygen saturation, neutrophil predominance,
raised urea and alanine transaminase, and lower aspartate transaminase.
On the multivariable binary logistic regression; age group, sex, and diabetes mellitus were
significantly associated with the development of symptoms.
Older age was found to be a significant factor that affects the development of symptomatic
COVID-19. Accordingly, after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of developing symptoms
were more likely among patients in the age range of 30 years and above compared with those
patients < 30 years old. The odds are higher (more than four times) for those patients 50 years
and above. That means older age groups are more susceptible to developing symptomatic disease
once they are infected. This could be because, as it is already known, the body’s immune defense
mechanism tends to get weaker with age making aged people more susceptible to severe disease
and worse outcomes from both infectious and non-infectious diseases. This is especially
compounded by the presence of other underlying conditions (comorbidities) which are highly
likely to be developed as someone gets older. The participants included in the study have also a
significantly higher proportion of patients with comorbid illnesses that can be attributed to the
increased odds of developing symptomatic disease17-20.

Male sex was associated with symptomatic COVID-19 infection. The odd of having
symptomatic COVID-19 among males was 1.672 times than female patients. This disparity in
sex in terms of symptoms and also acquiring the disease, having a more severe disease course,
and worse outcome is observed in many countries with reports showing that a significantly
higher proportion of men are getting hospitalized and dying from the disease compared to
females. Different explanations have been given to the disparity, from genetics up to behavioral
factors as contributors. Studies show that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is
found to be a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 is found to be present in high concentration among
males, which makes them vulnerable to have a more severe disease pattern and worse outcome 915
. It is also hypothesized that men might not be as good as women in terms of taking necessary
precautions to prevent acquiring the disease and also in seeking early medical attention if they
get infected and become symptomatic. Understanding these modifiable behavioral factors is
important to provide intervention to decrease severe disease and worse outcomes in men.
The other important factor that determines the development of symptomatic infection was being
a diabetic patient. The odds of developing symptomatic disease among diabetic patients were
2.368 times compared to patients with no such illness. It is well known that diabetes mellitus is
one of the chronic medical illnesses that is associated with depressed body immunity that will
leave the patient to be susceptible to any infectious diseases. It also increases the patients’
probability of developing another comorbid illness which in turn could result in diabetes disease

progression and development of short and long-term complications including poor glycaemic
control that will make the patient more susceptible to external invaders resulting in symptomatic
infection, severe disease, and poor outcome. This is also found to be the case in other studies,
where having diabetes is associated with unfavorable clinical presentation and COVID-19
outcome17-20.

CONCLUSION
Developing a symptomatic COVID-19 infection was found to be determined by the following
factors; old age, male sex, and being diabetic.
Therefore, patients with the above factors should be given enough attention, including inpatient
management, to pick symptoms earlier and to manage accordingly so that these patients can have
a favorable treatment outcome. In addition, further study should be conducted to assess the role
of behavioral factors as a cause of the disease course disparity between the two sexes, so that
intervention can be made on the identified modifiable behaviors.
