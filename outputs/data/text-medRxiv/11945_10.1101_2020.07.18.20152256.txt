ABSTRACT

Concerns of mothers seeking breastfeeding support during the COVID-19
pandemic, and the experiences of Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA)
volunteers who assisted them, were explored via an online survey. Surveys were
completed 16th March to 18th of May 2020 and described the COVID-19 related
concerns of 340 individuals. One hundred and thirty six mothers (64%) sought
support to protect their infants by continuing breastfeeding, increasing milk
supply, or restarting breastfeeding. Mothers were commonly stressed, isolated
and needing reassurance. Thirty four (10%) raised concerns about COVID-19
and breastfeeding safety. One hundred and twenty nine (61%) informed
volunteers they were unable to access face-to-face health services because of
fear or unavailability. Most common breastfeeding concerns were related to
insufficient milk or weight gain, painful breasts, relactation, and reducing
supplemental milk. Volunteers reported mothers were worried stress had
reduced milk supply, that milk supply concerns were exacerbated by the
inability to weigh infants, and that seeking medical treatment was being delayed.
ABA volunteers stated they felt supported and confident assisting mothers while
also expressing distress at mothers’ situation. ABA’s role in emergency response
should be recognised and national planning for infant and young child feeding in
emergencies, must be urgently developed, funded, and implemented.

INTRODUCTION

On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of
the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic (Ghebreyesus, 2020). In
Australia, the first confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus,
was identified on 25 January 2020 (Department of Health, 2020c). While virus
spread was initially slow, by 24 March there were 2051 cases (Department of
Health, 2020a). In the third and fourth week of March, Australian governments
imposed a variety of public health measures to reduce transmission. These
included banning international travel, closure of clubs, gyms, and restaurants,
limitation of individual movement outside the home, and gathering restrictions.
Schools and universities also shifted to remote learning. At the same time, health
services reduced in-person antenatal, postnatal, and child health appointments,
and cancelled mothers’ groups. The Australian Breastfeeding Association (ABA)
remained operational and continued to support women with breastfeeding.

Formed in 1964, ABA aims to provide women with practical mother-to-mother
support to enable them to breastfeed their infants and young children
(Australian Breastfeeding Association, 2019). ABA is a registered training
organisation and its volunteers undertake competency-based training to receive
a Certificate IV in Breastfeeding Education (Counselling or Community). ABA has
more than 1000 volunteer breastfeeding counsellors and community educators
who deliver antenatal breastfeeding education classes, run mothers’ groups,
facilitate social media groups, provide text-based support via the ABA LiveChat
service, and provide telephone counselling through the ABA National
Breastfeeding Helpline. The National Breastfeeding Helpline received more than

70,000 calls in 2018–19, operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, and
receives funding support from the Australian Government (Australian
Breastfeeding Association, 2019).

WHO made it clear even before the pandemic was declared, that mothers with
COVID-19 should be supported to breastfeed their infants (World Health
Organization, 2020c). While early research indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection
causes serious disease in 20% of people, significant illness in children was rare
(Wei et al., 2020; World Health Organization, 2020d). Experience with other
respiratory viruses suggested SAS-CoV-2 transmission via breastmilk was
unlikely (World Health Organization, 2020c). The role of breastfeeding in
protecting infant health required breastfeeding not be impeded (World Health
Organization, 2020c).

WHO published detailed guidance on COVID-19 and neonatal care on 13 March
2020 (World Health Organization, 2020a). This guidance stated that infants born
to women who are suspected or confirmed as having COVID-19 should be placed
skin-to-skin with their mothers immediately after birth, initiate breastfeeding
within an hour of birth, be kept proximate to their mothers day and night, and
exclusively breastfeed. These breastfeeding practices should be maintained
alongside infection prevention and control practices including respiratory
hygiene, hand hygiene, and the cleaning of surfaces (World Health Organization,
2020a). WHO also advised that all mothers should receive support to initiate and
establish breastfeeding and to manage breastfeeding difficulties from

appropriately trained health professionals and lay breastfeeding counsellors
(World Health Organization, 2020a).

From the end of the first week of March, ABA volunteers started reporting
mothers were delaying ceasing breastfeeding because of COVID-19 and an
increasing number of women wanting relactation assistance. It appeared the
pandemic might be changing the feeding practices of mothers and the support
ABA volunteers were being asked to provide. ABA national management team
members decided to launch an ABA volunteers survey to assess whether ABA
was providing volunteers, mothers, and other service users with the support
they needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS

Data was collected via an online survey using the SurveyMonkey® platform
accessed via a password-protected section of the ABA website between 16 March
and 18 May 2020. ABA volunteers were sent an email informing them of the
survey, and were also given a message about the survey when they logged into
the National Breastfeeding Helpline to take calls. They were asked to complete a
survey if people contacting them for assistance as an ABA volunteer raised
concerns about COVID-19 or mentioned COVID-19 as a reason for seeking
support from ABA.

The survey consisted of nine open-ended questions. Respondents were asked to
provide non-identifying information about how and when they were contacted,
and the concerns of the person seeking support, noting relactation and

increasing milk supply as potential areas of concern.They were also asked
whether there was anything they would like to share in relation to their
volunteer role and COVID-19 such as whether they felt they had the needed
knowledge and skills. Respondents could describe more than one contact in a
survey completion and could also complete the survey more than once. No
identifying information was collected from respondents.

Survey responses were exported into Excel® and coded using conventional
content analysis (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). The process of coding involved the
authors each reading all survey responses and two authors independently
undertaking open coding to identify the main ideas being expressed. The three
authors then discussed the coding outcomes and finalised a coding framework.
The full data set was then re-coded by one author using the finalised framework
which was then checked by another author. Where there was ambiguity, the
authors determined the appropriate code through discussion. Codes were
arranged into themes encompassing the data. Since the data was pre-existing,
contains no identifying information, and is of negligible risk, the research was
determined to be exempt from the need for ethical review by the Western
Sydney University Human Research Ethics Committee.

RESULTS

The online survey was completed 211 times and described the concerns of 340
individual contacts, including 336 mothers, two fathers, and one grandmother,
regarding 341 infants and young children, and one pregnant woman.
Respondents stated 207 times they were reporting on contacts made via the

Seeking support to protect infants by breastfeeding in the COVID-19

pandemic

One hundred and thirty-six mothers (64% of contacts) were reported to have
sought support to continue breastfeeding, to increase their milk supply or to
restart breastfeeding to protect their infants.

Support to continue breastfeeding
Sixty-four of these women had contacted ABA seeking support to continue
breastfeeding or avoid using infant formula. Children of these women ranged
from the very young, to older babies and toddlers. For example,

‘Baby was 12

days old… Had previous poor breastfeeding experiences and happily used formula

for other 3 babies. This time mother is concerned about the virus and wants the

baby to receive breastmilk’,

‘

I had two mothers of newborns under 10 days old.

Both had significant anxiety about keeping breastfeeding going to help protect the

baby from COVID-19’,

and

‘Mother thinking of weaning at 12 months but due to

pandemic had decided to continue breastfeeding’.

Support to increase milk supply to avoid or eliminate supplementary formula
feeds
Thirty-nine mothers sought assistance to increase their milk supply or reduce
infant formula supplementation because of COVID-19. Often infants were young
and mothers had been supplementing because of breastfeeding challenges. For
example, ‘

Nine-day-old baby who had been mostly formula-fed in hospital due to

latching difficulties and jaundice ... wanting to get the baby back onto the breast

fully’

, and

‘Mother was struggling with attachment, had started… formula but

wanted to get breastfeeding right’.

planned weaning was desired,

There were also instances where reversal of a

’10-month-old baby. Mother had begun the

weaning process, but due to COVID-19, was keen to increase supply so that she

could continue to breastfeed’.

Support to restart breastfeeding
Finally, 33 women were reported to have sought assistance with restarting
breastfeeding. In some cases, it had been a short time since breastfeeding had
ceased and they were reinitiating breastfeeding with a likely existent milk
supply, in other cases relactation was necessary. For example, ‘

8 days. Lost

weight at birth so formula. Baby willing to breastfeed. Loves it!!’ ‘Mother ceased

breastfeeding when babe was 3wks of age. Now 10 weeks…with threat of

coronovirus, wants to try to relactate’

, and

premature, mum decided to formula-feed from the start in hospital ... wanted to

know if she could start breastfeeding’

.

Why breastfeeding was viewed as protective

In almost half of cases (n=65, 48%) where women had sought support to protect
their infants by breastfeeding, ABA volunteers recorded why mothers viewed
breastfeeding as protective. In the majority of instances (n=55), it was because of
the anti-infective properties of breastmilk. For example,

‘Nine day old baby who

had been mostly formula fed in hospital…The mother was aware of COVID-19 and

,

wanted the immune system benefits of breastmilk’ ‘Mother wanted to keep her 11

day old breastfeeding to support his immune system ... for the best protection

against the coronavirus’,

and

‘Mum has a 9 month old and stopped breastfeeding 6

weeks ago ... hoping to relactate because she feels breastmilk is important for

immune factors with the COVID 19 crisis’.

A small number of of women (n=10) told volunteers they wanted to breastfeed
because they were concerned they might not be able to access infant formula.
For example,

‘Baby 4 weeks old…Mother now wanting to ditch formula and

exclusively breastfeed ‘in case he becomes reliant on the formula and I can no

longer get it’,

and

‘5 1/2-month-old baby … highly anxious and teary, worried that

if baby continues to refuse and weans anytime over the next few uncertain months

that she won't be able to get formula’.

Inability to access to face-to-face services because of COVID-19

An inability to access face-to-face health services was mentioned by 129 (61%)
of those who sought support from ABA. In about half of these cases, mothers
expressed an unwillingness to go to their General Practitioner (GP) or to see
their Maternal and Child Health Nurse (MCHN) because of a fear of exposure to
COVID-19. For example,

‘Mother of 3 week old having difficulty seeing her GP and

reluctant to see other health professionals, even refused a visit from a maternal

and child health nurse because of being worried about COVID-19,’ and ‘Whilst the

mother needed help she didn't want to go out of the house’.

In the other half of cases, volunteers reported mothers had been unable to access
health services because of service reductions. For example,

‘Early discharge due

to COVID19 but no associated extra support. This mother was in a rural location

with a 1-day-old baby receiving no support at all’, ’10 day old baby, mother not

received any midwife/MCHN visits since being discharged from hospital due to

COVID-19’,

and

‘Mum with 8-week-old, concerned about her milk supply…she could

not get any local assistance from her health service because all their facilities are

closed’.

Safety concerns related to COVID-19

Volunteers reported 34 instances where contacts raised safety concerns
regarding COVID-19. Most concerns were general in nature regarding whether
breastfeeding was safe when mothers are infected with SARS-CoV-2. For
example,

‘Concerns about feeding her 3 week old baby if she was to contract

Covid19 and whether she should wean’.

11

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .

In a few instances, the concern was more specific. For example,

‘A mother in NSW

who has been tested for the coronavirus and wanted to know if she could continue

BF… Very anxious and didn't want to feed if it would harm her baby’

‘

and

Grandmother made contact as her daughter had been advised by care providers at

a major tertiary hospital to stop breastfeeding while self-isolating after a possible

exposure event’

.

Although relatively small in number (n=9), it was nonetheless striking that
health professionals who were breastfeeding themselves, contacted ABA to ask
for information. For example,

‘Mum works in healthcare with Covid-19 patients,

wanted to know the safety of continuing to express at work v offering baby

formula’

and

‘Health care worker ... preparing to work with COVID-19 cases ...

looking for info about safely cleaning her pumping equipment in a shared sink

’.

Emotional wellbeing needs

ABA volunteers described 31 mothers who were finding isolation because of
COVID-19 difficult, 53 mothers who were anxious or stressed, and 63 instances
of mothers needing reassurance or providing mothers with reassurance. For
example,

‘Two mothers with babies under 1 week who were feeling very isolated

and insecure. I was able to give them information and reassurance’, ‘Was very

anxious and stressed as a result of feeling isolated from her mothers' group and

other contacts and felt like she was alone and stuck in ground hog day’

, and

‘Feeling very isolated with 10 week old baby. She was very grateful for info re

online ABA services’.

Sometimes volunteers described mothers just wanting to have someone to talk
to,

‘Mum feeling isolated and just wanted to talk’,

and

‘Many mothers appear to

want to talk and be listened to and are on the line for much longer than normal.

They just want to talk about the birth, what's happening with breastfeeding and

their baby and their home life’.

In some circumstances, stress and the need for reassurance was related to being
unable to access informal or health professional supports,

‘Mother was very

stressed as her normal supports could not help her ...[gave] reassurance’,

and

‘Mother of 6 day old had no in person consults scheduled and had a baby with signs

of inadequate intake. Was stressed as did not know how baby would be assessed

and cared for appropriately’.

Some mothers were stressed about the direct threat of COVID-19 and needed
reassurance, for example,

‘Both the mothers were very anxious about their babies

contracting the coronavirus’,

and

‘Both parents COVID positive and in isolation at

home. Much reassurance’.

Infant feeding concerns raised with ABA volunteers

There were 292 separate breastfeeding concerns raised with ABA volunteers
and reported in the survey. The four most common were regarding insufficient
milk or inadequate weight gain, painful breasts or nipples, relactation, and infant
formula supplementation (Table 2). In many instances, COVID-19 was a factor in
why mothers had these concerns and how these concerns presented.

Insufficient milk supply or inadequate weight gain
Eighty mothers (38%) sought assistance from ABA volunteers because they
believed their milk supply or infant’s weight gains were inadequate. Many
mothers stated they believed the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic had
negatively impacted their milk supply. For example,

‘Mother indicated she felt her

supply may have been affected due to her levels of anxiety around COVID’,

and

‘Mother was incredibly anxious about the impact of Covid-19. Her partner was a

high risk of exposure in his workplace so she was self-isolating with her 4-week-old

... worried that the stress was also affecting her supply’.

Concerns around weight gain were driven or exacerbated by the inability of
mothers to access face-to-face health services and to have their infant weighed.
For example,

‘Worried about not being able to weigh baby properly as unable to

see [health professionals] and using bathroom scales instead’,

and

‘Baby 17 days

old. Low supply, not sure if baby is getting enough, as baby can't be weighed.

Expressing and supplementing with formula with no extra support’.

Painful breasts and nipples
Forty-nine women (23% of contacts) sought assistance from ABA volunteers
with symptoms of mastitis or other breast infections. Many mothers had avoided
seeking medical attention for symptoms because of COVID-19. For example,

‘All

in relation to mastitis/blocked ducts. They said they would have usually gone to

their GP, but they were too scared to because of Covid-19’

and

‘Mother believes she

has mastitis (cold chills, breast pain etc over 24 hours) concerned about leaving the

house to see GP to get antibiotics’.

In one case, access to a doctor was prevented

by infection control policies not accounting for mothers having multiple children,
‘Mother had what sounded like a breast infection… I suggested GP visit. She said

she had two children and was unable to take both of them to her clinic because

they are limited to only 2 people in each consult.’

In other instances, concerns

regarding the overlap of symptoms between mastitis and COVID-19 jeopardised
access to medical care,

‘Mum with mastitis … GP refused to see her in person due to

temperature and flu-like symptoms’

and

‘Mum had a blocked duct and was worried

that her doctor wouldn't treat her appropriately if it becomes mastitis, due to the

flu-like symptoms… being COVID symptoms’.

As previously described, concerns related to relactation and reducing infant
formula supplementation were connected to mothers wanting to protect their
infants in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Council, 2012). Ninety-three percent of Australian women initiate breastfeeding
but premature cessation of exclusive and any breastfeeding is common
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2019). In the early postnatal period, as many as
22% of infants are fed supplementary infant formula and a further 16% cease
breastfeeding entirely (Ogbo et al., 2017). By 1 year of age, only 40% of infants
receive any breastmilk (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2019). However, our
study shows, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, mothers who had not initiated
or had stopped breastfeeding, or who were supplementary formula-feeding
contacted ABA for assistance to start/restart breastfeeding or increase their milk
supply. Infectious disease risk and concerns regarding infant formula availability
motivated women to breastfeed. It was particularly notable how many women
sought assistance with relactation. Under normal circumstances, support for
relactation is an uncommon reason for women to contact ABA. The 2019 ABA
client survey (n=395) included only three mothers who nominated relactation as
their contact reason. However, the heightened importance of immune protection
and food security provided by breastfeeding was a motivation for mothers to
restart breastfeeding in the COVID-19 pandemic (Salmon, 2015; Victora et al.,
2016).

With the exception of relactation, the most common breastfeeding concerns
related to COVID-19 were not different from those encountered under nonemergency conditions. Sore nipples or breasts are consistently the most common
concern reported in the annual ABA client survey. Similarly, concerns about low

milk supply (which may include concern about weight gain or a desire to
decrease formula supplementation) have been in the top four concerns of
mothers contacting ABA over the last 3 years. However, lack of access to health
care because of COVID-19 had an impact on how these concerns presented. Many
mothers described experiencing breast pain and other symptoms likely caused
by mastitis but were unable or afraid to visit their doctor to obtain treatment. If
left untreated, mastitis can result in tissue destruction and development of
abscesses requiring hospitalisation and surgery (Boakes, Woods, Johnson, &
Kadoglou, 2018). Anecdotally, La Leche League Italia reported an increase in
breast abscesses during the COVID-19 wave of March–April 2020 because
mothers had similarly delayed medical treatment (A. Venturini, personal
communication, July 10, 2020).

Concerns about milk supply and infant weight gain were also exacerbated by
lack of health care access and the inability of infants to be weighed. Similar
concerns associated regarding lack of ability to weigh infants has been reported
by the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers in the UK (E. Pickett, personal
communication, July 17, 2020). Feeding infant formula because of unresolved
milk supply concerns would adversely impact infant health (Quigley, Carson,
Sacker, & Kelly, 2016). Unidentified dehydration or failure-to-thrive could have
serious negative consequences (Jang et al., 2020; Livingstone, Willis, AbdelWareth, Thiessen, & Lockitch, 2000; Payne & Quigley, 2016). In two hospitals in
Italy, an 84% reduction in paediatric presentations and a 75% decline in
admissions occurred in March and April of 2020 raising concerns that fear of
seeking medical treatment could imperil child health (Manzoni, Militello, Fiorica,

Manzionna, & Cappiello). It seems possible fear or inability to access health care
because of COVID-19 could be affecting mothers and infants in many contexts.

Some mothers were concerned stress had affected their milk supply. The
erroneous belief that stress reduces milk production is common and, in
emergencies, women often perceive milk insufficiency (Gribble, 2014). Changes
in infant behaviour such as increased fussiness, more frequent feeds, night
waking, and an intolerance of maternal separation are commonly interpreted by
mothers as signifying milk supply problems. However, none of these behaviours
are reliable indicators of insufficient milk. Rather, such behaviour change is most
likely in response to altered circumstances and maternal distress in emergencies
and is to be expected. Stress can result in some temporary slowing of oxytocin
release and milk flow (but not milk production) also making infants fussy at the
breast (Ueda, Yokoyama, Irahara, & Aono, 1994). Breastfeeding counselling can
enable women who believe their milk supply is reduced due to stress, to regain
confidence in their ability to breastfeed and avoid infant formula use (UNICEF,
2008). For this reason, international infant feeding in emergency guidance
requires that emergency plans include provision for breastfeeding counselling
(IFE Core Group, 2017).

Inability to access health care, isolation from others, and concerns directly
related to COVID-19 were difficult for many mothers. Women were often in need
of not only practical assistance and information regarding breastfeeding but
reassurance and someone to talk to. The year following the birth of a child is a
time of transition as women experience changes to their body, the physical and

emotional demands of infant care, and changes in relationships, self-perception,
and employment (Fahey & Shenassa, 2013). During this time, social support
assists women to develop parenting self-efficacy and facilitates good mental
health (Leahy-Warren, McCarthy, & Corcoran, 2012). The pandemic reduced
mothers’ access to formal support mediated by the health system and informal
support from friends and relatives. Research from Belgium found high rates of
symptoms of anxiety and depression in new mothers during COVID-19 lockdown
(Ceulemans, Hompes, & Foulon, 2020). Contact with ABA provided women with
a form of social support as well as other components of breastfeeding support,
like emotional support and reassurance, practical assistance, and informational
support (McFadden et al., 2017). The mother-to-mother support ABA provides,
may have been particularly salient as volunteers had the shared experience of
isolation from family and friends, often were also caring for infants and young
children, and all had breastfed themselves (Rossman et al., 2011). Proactive
telephone support by ABA counsellors increases breastfeeding rates at 6 months
of age (Forster et al., 2019). However, it may be the emotional support provided
by volunteers was especially significant to the wellbeing of mothers who were
isolated because of COVID-19.

ABA launched the survey reported on in this study partly in order to ascertain
whether volunteers were adequately supported. It was reassuring that the
majority of those who commented on their volunteer role, stated they felt
supported and confident. Their comments noted their general training and the
specific ABA COVID-19 resources as of assistance. In March and April 2020, ABA
produced COVID-19 resources for volunteers, parents, and health professionals.

Resources regarding the safety of breastfeeding and COVID-19 were targeted at
all groups and based on WHO guidance (World Health Organization, 2020a,
2020b). Support materials for volunteers focused on accessing governmentfunded telehealth services (Department of Health, 2020b), and relactation. A
video for health professionals on assessing infant milk intake during telehealth
consultations without the ability to weigh was produced (Australian
Breastfeeding Association, 2020).

Volunteers reported feeling distressed for mothers and satisfaction in providing
assistance. Cultivation of empathy with mothers is core to breastfeeding
counselling (World Health Organization, 1993). However, empathic response to
individuals in difficulty can lead to helpers experiencing traumatic stress
(Regehr, Goldberg, & Hughes, 2002). Alternatively, where assistance is effective,
it can lead to compassion satisfaction (Wagaman, Geiger, Shockley, & Segal,
2015). Comments from ABA volunteers reflected some had experienced
compassion satisfaction but the distress and workload pressure noted by others
underlines the importance of supporting volunteers. It is noteworthy that female
ABA volunteers were undertaking their ABA work often alongside paid
employment, and a disproportionate burden of household management,
childcare, and education supervision noted as impacting women in the pandemic
(McLaren, Wong, Nguyen, & Mahamadachchi, 2020).

This research highlights the role of ABA in Australia’s COVID-19 health response.
Particularly during the early stages of the pandemic, health service provision
suffered as major adjustments had to be made. However, ABA service design

meant support to mothers continued largely uninterrupted during the March–
May lockdown. ABA volunteers staffing the National Breastfeeding Helpline and
LiveChat work from home and no adjustments for isolation measures were
necessary. ABA has run online mother support groups (particularly in remote or
rural areas) for many years and ABA support groups moved more broadly to
online provision from 17 March. Demand for services increased; in April 2020,
the National Breastfeeding Helpline received 500–1000 calls in excess of that
expected. It is undoubtedly the case that ABA’s services provided a safety net
that helped protect mothers and infants. However, as noted by one survey
respondent, lack of promotion of ABA’s services may have resulted in underutilisation. It may have also left a gap for commercial expoitation. The infant
formula manufacturer (Nutricia) targeted doctors with advertisements for their
helpline stating they were ‘here to help … share the load’ during the crisis.
Doctors were invited to direct patients with feeding concerns to their helpline
which begins each call with an advertisement for their infant formula store. The
exploitation of the pandemic by the baby food industry appears to be an
international phenomenon (Cullinan, 2020) which Australia is not immune to.

Despite the role ABA played in supporting mothers and infants during the
COVID-19 pandemic, ABA is not mentioned in any Australian emergency plans.
More broadly, this pandemic has highlighted again that Australia lacks
emergency planning for infants. The National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness
Plan recognises infants as a vulnerable group and advises specific strategies be
implemented to protect them (Department of Health, 2019). However, neither it
nor any state or territory pandemic plan contains infant feeding content. A

recent audit of Australian emergency plans and guidance revealed a dearth of
planning for infants at all levels of government and in all emergency types
(Gribble, Peterson, & Brown, 2019). Nonetheless, the Australian Government’s
funding support for the National Breastfeeding Helpline was a measure that
contributed to resilience in Australia’s health systems in the COVID-19 pandemic
to the benefit of mothers and infants. The Council of Australian Governments’
National Breastfeeding Strategy states that skilled breastfeeding support should
be available to mothers and infants during emergencies and that a national
policy on infant and young child feeding in emergencies should be developed.
The shortcomings of the emergency response in the 2019–20 Black Summer of
Bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear such planning must be
urgently developed, funded, and implemented.

Study Limitations

It is a limitation of this study that not all ABA volunteers who were contacted by
individuals with concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have
completed the study survey. In addition, not all individuals whose breastfeeding
concerns were related to the pandemic may have mentioned this to ABA
volunteers or fully explained their concerns.

CONCLUSION

Mothers are responsive to awareness of heightened risks to infants in
emergencies and are willing to change feeding practices as a result. Exclusive
and continued breastfeeding provides infants with a safe and secure food and
water supply and protection from infection and should be promoted as an

emergency preparedness activity promoting community resilience. Mothers
were negatively impacted by the reduction or removal of formal and informal
supports for breastfeeding and mothering during the pandemic. However, ABA
services continued to provide support and were able to rapidly deploy key
information to mothers, ABA volunteers, and health professionals. The role ABA
can play in emergency response should be recognised and reflected in
emergency planning. There is an urgent need for the Federal Department of
Health to convene and fund a national advisory committee to adapt international
infant and young child feeding emergency planning and guidance (IFE Core
Group, 2017) for the Australian context.
