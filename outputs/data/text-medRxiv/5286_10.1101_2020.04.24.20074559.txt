Abstract

15

Multiple laboratory developed tests and commercially available assays have emerged to meet

16

diagnostic needs related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To date, there is limited comparison

17

data for these different testing platforms. We compared the analytical performance of a

18

laboratory developed test (LDT) developed in our clinical laboratory based on CDC primer sets

19

and four commercially available, FDA emergency use authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2

20

(Cepheid, DiaSorin, Hologic Panther, and Roche Cobas) on a total of 169 nasopharyngeal swabs.

21

The LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays were the most sensitive assays for SARS-

22

CoV-2 with 100% agreement across specimens. The Hologic Panther Fusion, DiaSorin Simplexa,

23

and Roche Cobas 6800 only failed to detect positive specimens near the limit of detection of

24

our CDC-based LDT assay. All assays were 100% specific, using our CDC-based LDT as the gold

25

standard. Our results provide initial test performance characteristics for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

26

and highlight the importance of having multiple viral detection testing platforms available in a

27

public health emergency.

Introduction

29

Since the first infection with SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the United States in January

30

2020 (1), there has been an exponential growth in cases and deaths (2). At the time of this

31

writing, the US case count exceeds 600,000 with more than 30,000 deaths and considerable

32

geographic heterogeneity (2, 3). Despite social distancing policies, the outbreak of Covid-19, the

33

disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to grow and threatens to overwhelm hospital systems

34

in multiple states (2).

35

The explosion of Covid-19 cases in the United States has highlighted the critical role

36

diagnostic testing plays in medical and public health decision making in containing and

37

mitigating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Reliable test results enable appropriate utilization of

38

scarce hospital resources, including personal protective equipment (PPE) and negative pressure

39

isolation rooms, as well as public health resources for contact tracing or isolation decision-

40

making (4). In rapid succession in March 2020, multiple assays have become available including

41

both FDA-EUA test platforms and laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for use in high-complexity

42

clinical laboratories. To solve supply chain difficulties, clinical laboratories have had to

43

implement multiple assays using scarce reagent resources, rendering thorough comparisons

44

challenging. A clear understanding of the analytical parameters of these options is important to

45

help guide assay selection by clinical laboratories when supply chain considerations subside (4).

46

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the mainstay of SARS-CoV-2

47

detection in vitro (5). FDA EUA authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 have mostly targeted two loci

48

of the positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus by real time RT-PCR and are reported

49

qualitatively. Our laboratory has recently reported that the CDC N2 and WHO E-gene

50

primer/probe sets are among the most sensitive and have detected no false positives in our

51

LDTs (6). FDA EUA authorized platforms use a variety of different primer/probe sets, resulting in

52

the potential for differing analytical sensitivities. In addition to differing analytical sensitivities,

53

commercially available platforms have important operational differences including integrated

54

sample extraction, run time, random access, and acceptable sample types.

55

Here, the performances of one LDT-EUA assay developed in our clinical laboratory and

56

four FDA-EUA cleared assays were evaluated for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The FDA-EUA cleared

57

assays included were: Hologic Panther Fusion (both RUO and EUA versions, EUA version

58

performed at two study sites), DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct (EUA), Cepheid Xpert Xpress

59

SARS-CoV-2 (EUA), and Roche Cobas 6800 (EUA). Test performance characteristics of each RT-

60

PCR were determined compared to our reference LDT assay.

61

63

Specimen collection and consensus panel selection. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs (N =

64

169) were collected from patient specimens submitted to the University of Washington Medical

65

Center laboratories for clinical diagnostic testing. LDT performance was validated based on

66

detection of 20 of 20 positives sent by the Washington State Public Health Laboratory in early

67

March. Residual clinical samples were used for validation/verification of each subsequent

68

instrument, including a common panel of 26 specimens (12 positive, 1 inconclusive, and 13

69

negative) tested at UW by the UW CDC EUA-based LDT (CDC LDT), DiaSorin Simplexa (positives

70

only), Roche Cobas 6800, and tested at LabCorp Seattle on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress, and

71

Panther Fusion (12 positives only). Additional residual (N = 115) specimens were tested at UW

on individual assays and compared to the reference method (LDT): Panther Fusion (RUO), N =

73

36; Panther Fusion (EUA)-UW, N = 20; DiaSorin Simplexa (EUA), N = 19; Cobas 6800, N = 40.

74

Finally, 28 specimens were used to compare the SARS-CoV-2 assay on the UW Panther Fusion

75

with the DiaSorin Simplexa assay. All same-sample comparisons were performed on specimens

76

stored at 4oC for less than 72 hours with no freeze-thaws. Inconclusive results (one of two

77

targets detected) were considered positive due to the high specificity of all assays and limited

78

cross-reactivity seen for SARS-CoV-2 primer sets. This work was approved under a consent

79

waiver from the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

80
81

Sample processing. For the UW CDC LDT, total nucleic acid (NA) was extracted from

82

200µL of VTM on the Roche MP96 and eluted in 50µL of elution buffer. Real-time RT-PCR was

83

set up on 5µL of eluate using the CDC N1, N2, and RP (or Exo internal control) primers and run

84

on ABI 7500 real-time PCR instruments as reported previously (6). For the Hologic Panther

85

Fusion, 500µL of VTM was transferred to lysis buffer in manufacturer-provided tubes and

86

loaded directly on the instrument. For the DiaSorin Simplexa and Cepheid Xpert Xpress, 50µL or

87

300µL of VTM sample respectively was loaded directly into the reaction cartridge with

88

integrated sample process. For the Roche Cobas 6800, 600µL of specimen VTM was added to a

89

barcoded 12x75mm secondary tube and loaded directly on the instrument.

94

Panther Fusion RUO and EUA assays were slightly less sensitive than the CDC-based LDT,

95

missing one positive/inconclusive in each sample set (Table 1a/b). One additional specimen was

96

initially negative with the RUO reagents but was detected upon repeat with the Panther Fusion

97

EUA assay. Discordant specimens were either inconclusive (one target of two detected) or had

98

high average CTs (>37) by the CDC LDT test. All 29 negative specimens generated “Not

99

detected” results by the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay.

100
101

DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2. We next compared the DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2 assay to

102

our CDC-based LDT. All 19 specimens (11 positives and 8 negatives) demonstrated complete

103

concordance between the two platforms (Table 2a) with lower CTs recovered by the DiaSorin

104

compared to the LDT on all specimens (average CT difference -2.1 [IQR -2.3 – -1.7]). When we

105

compared SARS-CoV-2 detection on the DiaSorin Simplexa to the Hologic Panther Fusion, all 16

106

Hologic Panther Fusion positives were detected by the DiaSorin Simplexa, while the DiaSorin

107

Simplexa generated one additional positive in the 12 specimens that were negative by the

108

Hologic Panther Fusion (Table 2b). This discordant specimen was detected by the CDC-based

109

LDT with CTs of 36.8 (N1) and 35.8 (N2), confirming the DiaSorin Simplexa result.

110
111

Roche Cobas SARS-CoV-2. We next compared the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay to our CDC

112

LDT. All 20 negatives demonstrated complete concordance between the two platforms (Table

113

3). One of the 20 positives was not detected by the Roche assay. This specimen had CTs of 38.0

114

(N1) and 37.4 (N2) in the LDT. Across the 20 positive specimens, CTs were only slightly higher

on the Roche Cobas assay compared to the CDC-based LDT, with an average CT difference of

116

0.6 [IQR -0.1 – 1.5].

117
118

Five-way same-sample comparison including Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay

119

After performing the above pairwise comparisons, we next compared twenty-six specimens (13

120

positive, 13 negative) from another high-complexity hospital laboratory (LabCorp Seattle). All

121

26 were also tested on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Table 4). All specimens

122

with CT < 35 on the CDC-based LDT were detected by all platforms, and all specimens not

123

detected by the Cepheid Xpert were not detected by two other platforms examined (CDC LDT,

124

Roche Cobas). One of 13 positive specimens was a presumptive positive on the Cepheid assay

125

(E-gene CT 42.6, N2-gene negative); upon repeat per package insert, the N2-gene was detected

126

at CT 42.7 but the E-gene was not detected, yielding a positive result. The CDC LDT

127

demonstrated 100% concordance with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress, also detecting the extremely

128

low viral load specimen above as an inconclusive (N1 37.4, N2 not detected). No other assay

129

detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in this specimen. In addition, the DiaSorin Simplexa failed to detect a

130

positive specimen that on repeat was detected only by the ORF1ab primer set.

131
132

Discussion

133

This analysis compared the performance characteristics of several in vitro diagnostic real

134

time RT-PCR assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 in high-complexity clinical laboratories in one of the

135

early US epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrated excellent

136

performance of a CDC-based LDT and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress, concurring with a previous

137

evaluation that demonstrated high sensitivity of the E-gene and N2 primer sets used by the

138

Cepheid assay (6). The Panther Fusion was somewhat less sensitive than either the LDT or the

139

DiaSorin; however, the Panther Fusion detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in one specimen that was

140

inconclusive (1 of 2 targets detected, thus presumed positive) by the UW CDC LDT. The Roche

141

assay performed on the Cobas 6800 platform detected 28/30 positive samples; both of these

142

discordant specimens had low viral titers (UW CDC LDT CT >37) and one was the inconclusive

143

specimen. Therefore, we conclude that all the tested assays show good sensitivity for the

144

detection of SARS-CoV-2, with the UW CDC LDT and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assays

145

having the best and similar sensitivity, followed by the Roche Cobas 6800, DiaSorin Simplexa,

146

and Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assays.

147

Our results are chiefly limited by the small sample sets used to compare these different

148

assays as well as asynchronous comparisons that only allowed for pairwise comparisons early in

149

the pandemic. For instance, these asynchronous panels most greatly affected our CDC LDT

150

versus Hologic Panther Fusion comparison, which had a greater proportion of high CT positive

151

specimens that resulted in a lower measured sensitivity for the Panther Fusion. . In clinical

152

practice, the minor differences in sensitivity are likely to have little effect on Hologic Panther

153

Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay performance on VTM specimens, given the CT ranges we have

154

observed in our clinical populations.

155

Despite their limitations, these data provide a basis for differences in analytical

156

sensitivity at different CTs that may be seen between platforms. For instance, recent reports

157

have demonstrated a slightly higher analytical sensitivity of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-

158

CoV-2 assay compared to the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test, and a slightly lower sensitivity of

159

the DiaSorin Simplexa SARS-CoV-2 assay compared to a modified CDC assay, both of which are

160

concordant with our data (7, 8). We also note that, while analytical sensitivity is of critical

161

importance, many other considerations factor into assay platform selection including assay

162

availability, cost, turnaround time, and throughput.

163

Our results provide an early assessment of performance characteristics of five separate

164

assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. During March 2020, reagent availability for SARS-COV-2

165

RT-PCR assays was heavily constrained, necessitating more limited assay comparisons. All

166

platforms examined here had acceptable performance criteria for testing during the early part

167

of this pandemic. As the supply chain for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR attempts to catch up with testing

168

demand, we look forward to additional assay comparison data.
