Abstract

The impact of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV-r) to

treat patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and commonly used drugs in clinical

practice is not well-known. Thus, we evaluated the rate and severity of DDI between LPV-r

for COVID-19 treatment and concomitant medications. This was a cross-sectional study

including all individuals diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with LPV-r and attended

st

at a single center in Southern Spain (March 1

th

to April 30 , 2020). The frequency [95%

confidence interval (95% CI)] of potential and major DDI were calculated. Overall, 469

patients were diagnosed of COVID-19, 125 (27%) of them were prescribed LPV-r. LPV-r had

potential DDI with concomitant medications in 97 (78%, 95% CI: 69%-85%) patients, and in

33 (26%, 95% CI: 19%-35%) individuals showed major DDI. Twelve (36%) patients with major

DDI and 14 (15%) individuals without major DDI died (p=0.010). After adjustment, only the

Charlson index was independently associated with death [adjusted OR (95% CI) for Charlson

index ≥5: 85 (10-731), p <0.001]. LPV-r was discontinued due to side effects in 31 (25%)

patients. Management by the Infectious Diseases Unit was associated with a lower likelihood

of major DDI [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.53), p=0.003). In conclusion, a high

frequency of DDI between LPV-r for treating COVID-19 and concomitant medications was

found, including major DDI. Patients with major DDI showed worse outcomes, but this

association was explained by the older age and comorbidities. Patients managed by the

Infectious Diseases Unit had lower risk of major DDI.

Introduction

Since December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

infection has become pandemic in a few months. The rapid spread of this novel coronavirus

has been further complicated by a wide spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19),

spanning asymptomatic or mild disease to multiorgan failure

1–3

. Lacking efficacy-proved

treatments, the approach to the management of COVID-19 has been largely empirical, based
on indirect data on the antiviral activity of compounds not formally assessed in randomized

controlled clinical trials for safety and efficacy

4,5

.

Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV-r) was initially used as antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 infection

based on indirect data. Thus, LPV-r has in vitro inhibitory activity against severe acute

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

6

. In addition, a non-randomized study

suggested a positive clinical and virological effect of LPV-r added to ribavirin among patients

with SARS-CoV infection

7

. LPV-r showed in vitro and in an animal model activity against

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)

8,9

. Viral clearance was reported

for some MERS-CoV cases receiving combinations including LPV-r

10

. Finally, a clinical trial

randomizing patients with COVID-19 to standard of care or standard of care plus LPV-r has

been reported

11

. The median time to clinical improvement was shorter in the group treated

with LPV-r in the modified intention-to-treat analysis

11

. However, the trial failed to find

differences in the primary objective.

One issue with LPV-r is the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDI) affecting a wide variety

of commonly used medications

12

. Among those, lipid lowering drugs, antiarrhythmics,

cardiovascular drugs, analgesics or anticoagulants are frequently used by aged patients.

These older patients are more likely to present with more severe COVID-19 requiring

admission and respiratory support, and, due to this, more likely candidates to receive drugs

with potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, as LPV-r. Management of LPV-r by non-

infectious diseases doctors, not used to the DDI profile of this drug, along with the need for a

fast response and the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 in some areas might have led to a

high rate of major DDI between LPV-r and concomitant prescriptions. DDI could have an
impact on the tolerability of LPV-r and DDI may even be associated with worse outcomes.

However, to our knowledge, there is no data on the frequency and impact of DDI between

LPV-r to treat patients with COVID-19 and commonly used drugs in clinical practice. Because

of these, we evaluated the rate and severity of DDI between LPV-r for COVID-19 treatment

and concomitant medications.

Results

Characteristics of the study population

Four hundred and sixty-nine patients had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection

during the study period. Among them, 125 (27%) individuals were prescribed LPV-r for

COVID-19. The median (Q1-Q3) duration of LPV-r treatment was 5 (3-7) days, ranging from 1

to 14 days. Most patients presented comorbidities detected before SARS-CoV-2 infection

(Table 1). Thirty-four (27%) patients did not show any previous comorbidity. The median

(Q1-Q3) Charlson index was 3 (1-4). Approximately one quarter of the study population

showed a Charlson index ≥5 (Table 1). The most frequent clinical presentation of LPV-r-

treated patients was pneumonia (Table 1). One hundred and twenty-one (97%) patients
were admitted to the hospital, 14 (12%) of them required intensive care, and 26 (21%) died.

The characteristics of the study population are summarized in table 1.

Frequency and severity drug-drug interactions

Overall, LPV-r had DDI with concomitant medications in 103 (82%, 95% CI: 75%-89%)

subjects. In 97 (78%, 95% CI: 69%-85%) patients, potential DDI were disclosed, and in 33

(26%, 95% CI: 19%-35%) individuals major DDI were found. Concomitant medications with

potential DDI classified by therapeutic group are summarized in figure 1a. Drugs with major

DDI with LPV-r are shown in Figure 1b. Twenty-two (23%) of 97 individuals undergoing
potential DDI between LPV-r and their concomitant medication died compared with 4 (14%)

of 28 patients without potential DDI (p=0.335). Twelve (36%) of 33 patients with major DDI

and 14 (15%) of 92 individuals without major DDI died (p=0.010). After adjustment, only the

Charlson index was independently associated with death (Table 2).

Among patients managed in the Infectious Diseases Unit, 41 (76%) of 54 individuals showed

potential DDI compared with 56 (79%) of 71 patients treated outside the Infectious Diseases

Unit (p=0.695). Major DDI were observed in 9 (17%) patients vs. 24 (34%) patients managed

by the Infectious Diseases Unit vs. units other than the Infectious Diseases Unit, respectively
(p=0.031). The median Charlson index was 2 (1-4) compared with 3 (2-4) for patients

managed by the Infectious Diseases Unit and by other units, respectively (p=0.024). The

proportion of patients with major DDI treated within the Infectious Diseases Unit by the

Charlson index was: Charlson index 0-2, 2 (6.1%); Charlson index 3-4, 1 (8.3%); Charlson

index ≥5, 6 (67%) (p<0.001). The proportion of patients with major DDI managed by other

units by the Charlson index was: Charlson index 0-2, 7 (24%); Charlson index 3-4, 11 (44%);

Charlson index ≥5, 6 (35%) (p=0.303). After adjustment by sex and the Charlson index,

management by the Infectious Diseases Unit was independently associated with a lower
likelihood of major DDI [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI): 0.14 (0.04-0.53), p=0.003).

LPV-r was discontinued due to side effects in 31 (25%) patients. One patient with pre-

existing chronic end-stage renal failure suffered grade 3 diarrhea. LPV-r was discontinued,

Discussion

In the present study, we found a high overall frequency of DDI between LPV-r for treating

COVID-19 and concomitant medications. Moreover, nearly one third of the patients were

treated with commonly used medications with major DDI with LPV-r. Patients in whom

major DDI were observed showed a worse clinical outcome, but this association was

explained by the older age and comorbidities of these patients. Finally, patients managed by
the Infectious Diseases Unit had lower risk of major DDI.

Coadministration of LPV-r with drugs that are major substrates of and highly dependent on

CYP3A for clearance is associated with increased plasma concentrations of such drugs or

their metabolites. In our study, many commonly used medications with that metabolic

interaction

with

LPV-r

were

prescribed

to

patients

with

COVID-19.

Antiarrhythmics,

symvastatin or budesonide were found to be administered to the study patients. Elevated

plasma concentrations of some of those medications are associated with life-threatening
reactions. In this regard, we found a significantly higher frequency of deaths among patients

who were treated with medications with major DDI with LPV-r. However, after adjustment in

a multivariate model, drugs with major DDI with LPV-r were not independently associated

with the risk of death. Instead, the main predictor of death was the Charlson index.

Therefore, the patient profile, i.e. older individuals with concomitant diseases needing drugs

posing contraindications with LPV-r, accounted for the association between deaths and

major interactions with LPV-r.

Patients with COVID-19 treated with LPV-r in the present study were severely ill. The

majority needed admission and had high Charlson index scores. More importantly, the

overall death rate was 21%, i.e. greater than the mortality reported in hospitalized patients

in China

1,2

. The older age of patients and their elevated Charlson index could explain the

higher death rate in our study.

Discontinuations of LPV-r due to adverse events among HIV-infected patients were lower

than 10% after two years of antiretroviral treatment

14

. In a randomized clinical trial of LPV-r

for COVID-19 in China, patients stopped early a course of 14 days of LPV-r even more

frequently

11

. Nearly 14% of LPV-r recipients were unable to complete treatment due to

adverse events in that trial. In our study, one fourth of the patients discontinued LPV-r

because of severe adverse events. The aged and fragile population receiving LPV-r in our

study could be more prone to develop LPV-r-related side effects. In fact, our study

population was older and accumulated more coexisting conditions than the patients

recruited in the Chinese trial of LPV-r for COVID-19

11

. The elevated frequency of LPV-r

discontinuations in fragile patients with severe COVID-19 questions the clinical applicability

of LPV-r as antiviral in such patients.

We found that major DDI between comedications and LPV-r were more frequent among

patients managed by non-Infectious Diseases Units compared with the Infectious Diseases

Unit. After adjustment by the Charlson index, an independent association between major

DDI with LPV-r and the treating unit was confirmed. A few factors could explain this finding.

First, the overwhelming COVID-19 crisis in our center led to admitting patients with COVID-

19 in wards other than the Infectious Diseases ward. In this situation, treatment stewardship

by Infectious Diseases doctors was not feasible. Second, management by Infectious Diseases

specialists has demonstrated to improve the outcome of patients with other infections

15,16

.

However, even Infectious Diseases physicians, more aware of the DDI of ritonavir-boosted

HIV protease inhibitors than other specialists, exposed patients to major DDI with LPV-r. The

complexity of patients, staff shortage due to quarantines of doctors falling ill or exposed to

unprotected close contacts, and the many difficulties imposed by a health crisis might partly
explain those prescription mistakes.

The present study may have some limitations. First, due to LPV-r supply shortage, this

antiviral drug was restricted mostly to more severe patients, those requiring hospitalization.

This population represents an extreme of the pandemic, with more complications needing

medical intervention and worse outcomes. LPV-r given to younger and less fragile patients

might have been more tolerable, with less DDI and discontinuations. Second, post-discharge

deaths at home or nursing facilities were not evaluated, only deaths during admissions or at
the emergency room were evaluable for the present study. Death rates could have been

even higher than those reported herein with a follow-up after discharge, as suggested by

another study

17

. Third, the main source of data was the electronic clinical records and the

Pharmacy electronic prescriptions. This might have precluded detailed medical record

review and it could have led to data loss. However, currently in the Andalusian Health

System, health and medical records of every patient are collected in a common electronic

database by all caring physicians and nurses. Medications are also prescribed using

electronic prescriptions both for outpatients and inpatients. In this regard, individual patient

electronic medical records were manually evaluated. These are strengths of the present

study.

In conclusion, LPV-r for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 frequently interacts with

concomitant medications. Major DDI contraindicating the coadministration of LPV-r and

common medications were alarmingly overlooked in the setting of the COVID-19 health care

crisis. Safer antiviral treatments for COVID-19, with a better interaction profile, are clearly
warranted.

Patients and methods

This was a cross-sectional study. All individuals diagnosed of SARS-CoV-2 infection from

st

March 1

th

to April 30 , 2020 attended at a single center in Seville, Southern Spain, were

evaluated to identify those treated with LPV-r. All patients with COVID-19, confirmed by

SARS-CoV-2 PCR or serology, who were prescribed LPV-r as a part of their treatment for

SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The electronic clinical records and Pharmacy electronic
prescriptions of all patients were examined to select those who received at least one dose of

LPV-r. Concomitant medications were collected from the electronic prescriptions.

The

electronic clinical records were used to identify comorbid conditions to calculate the

Charlson index for each patient

13

. The vital status of patients was established querying

electronic clinical records and it was last updated in May 22

nd

, 2020.

DDI were evaluated using the COVID-19 Drug Interactions site (https://www.covid19-

druginteractions.org/) by the Liverpool Drug Interaction Group. The frequency and grade of
DDI was assessed. DDI were graded, according to the Liverpool Drug Interaction Group, as

potential and major. Potential DDI does not preclude co-administration, since they are

usually manageable, but they indicate the need to balance risks and benefits for an

individual patient. Major DDI correspond to the “do not co-administer” classification of the

Liverpool Drug Interaction Group. The death rate by the severity of DDI was assessed. In

addition, side effects leading to discontinuation of LPV-r were examined.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were compared by the Student-t test, or the Mann-Whitney U if

applicable. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test, or the Fisher test

where necessary. 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the overall,

potential and major frequencies of DDI. Factors associated with death were entered in a

logistic regression model, adjusted by age and sex. The STATA 16.0 and IBM SPSS 25

packages were used for the analysis.

Ethics issues

The study was designed and performed according to the Helsinki declaration and approved

by the Ethics Committee of the Valme University Hospital (Seville, Spain). Informed consent
was waived by the Ethics Committee of the Valme University Hospital due to the

observational retrospective design of the study.
