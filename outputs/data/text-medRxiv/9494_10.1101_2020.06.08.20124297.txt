Abstract
Background
African Americans have been severely affected by COVID-19 noted with the rising
mortality rates within the African American community. Health disparities, health
inequities and issues with systemic health access are some of the pre-existing issues
African Americans were subjected to within the southern states in the United States.
Second, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to reduce the
spread of COVID-19. However, social distancing was not practical and presented a
challenge within the African American community, specifically, in the southern states.
Objective
This article assesses the effect of COVID-19 on African Americans in the southern
states.
Methodology
This short communication queried the publicly available Department of Health statistics
on COVID-19 related mortality and underlying health conditions in four southern states
(Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA] and Mississippi [MS]) with a high
proportion of African American residents. Second, the unacast COVID-19 toolkit was
used to derive a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three
different metrics: (i) percent change in average distance travelled (ii) percent change in
non-essential visits and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national
baseline).
Results
Across the four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in
the African American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of
the population cumulatively. This article finds that all four southern states received a
social distancing grade of F. COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are
higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed racial disparities in our healthcare system that
disproportionately impacts African Americans within the four states of the southern
United States. In addition, the lack of diversity in the healthcare system likely impacts
this disproportionate impact on African American communities because it is not able to
address its primary obligations within minority communities. Recognizing that there is a
great need for African American representation or diversity in the health workforce
would be able to better address the health disparities.

We have read with great interest the recent series of commentaries in CDC on
disparities in hospitalization and death rates amongst African American populations
compared to Caucasians 1-3. However, a systematic quantitative assessment of these
important metrics, critical for implementing public health measures like testing, tracing
and isolation in the highest risk communities, is still lacking.
We queried the publicly available Department of Health (DOH) statistics on COVID-19
related mortality in four southern states (Alabama [AL], Georgia [GA], Louisiana [LA]
and Mississippi [MS]) with a high proportion of African American residents. Across the
four states, on average, as many as 54% of COVID-19 related deaths are in the African
American community, although this minority group comprises only 32% of the
population cumulatively. Specifically, the proportion of African Americans residing in a
given southern state and the proportion of COVID-19 related mortality that are
comprised of African Americans in that state are as follows: AL – 26.6% and `50%, GA
– 31.5% and ~50%, LA – 32.2% and 59%, and MS – 37.7% and 57%. The number of
deaths in the minority population has kept at par with Caucasians in three of the four
states, and exceeded the latter in the hardest hit state of LA (Figure 1).
There are likely to be several reasons for the disproportionate causes of mortality
amongst African Americans in the four southern states we have interrogated here. First,
emerging clinical series on COVID-19 have demonstrated that adverse outcomes are
higher in individuals with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular
diseases, or pre-existing pulmonary compromise 4,5. Indeed, in three of the states (AL,
LA and MS) where such data is publicly cataloged, many of the patients dying from
causes related to confirmed COVID-19 had an underlying chronic health condition
(Table 1). Secondly, social distancing is a critical non-pharmacological intervention to
reduce
the
spread
of
COVID-19.
The
unacast
COVID-19
toolkit
(https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard) can be used to derive
a social distancing (SD) grade for any given state, based on three different metrics: (i)
percent change in average distance traveled (ii) percent change in non-essential visits
and (iii) decrease in human encounters (compared to national baseline), each of is an
average to create the overall grade for that state. Based on these parameters, all four
states received a SD grade of F. Unfortunately, the suboptimal SD measures adopted
statewide is even more likely to impact individuals living in crowded urban localities,
those relying on public transport, or families where one or more members have been
deemed
as
“essential”
at-work
personnel.
According
to
PovertyUSA
(www.povertyUSA.org), the poverty rates in the four states stands at 18.4% on average,
which is greater than the national rate of 14.1%; in addition, of the reported overall
numbers, the average poverty rate amongst the African American community (29.1%) is
approximately 2.3 times higher compared to Caucasians (12.6%). The median
household income reported by US Census Bureau for AL, GA, LA and MS were
$49,861, $58,756, $47,905, and $44,717, respectively, which is, on average, more than
$11,600 less than the national median household income ($61,937).
While we cannot exclude an underlying genetic basis to the disproportionate burden of
mortality related to COVID-19 among the African American community (for example

ACE2 polymorphisms), the emerging data strongly suggests that African American
communities face an array of social and economic inequities that impact their baseline
health status and access to healthcare, and is likely driving the course of the pandemic
in this population 6. Measures at mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on African Africans
need to address these inequities in lockstep with more conventional interventions.
