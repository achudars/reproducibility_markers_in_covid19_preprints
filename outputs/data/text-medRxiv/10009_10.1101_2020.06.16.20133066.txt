ABSTRACT
Background: Some studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective drug in
reducing the in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, the in vivo effect of HCQ still unclear.
This study aims to evaluate viral load clearance in patients with COVID-19 who underwent HCQ
treatment in comparison with a control group that did not receive the drug. Methods: This
prospective study comprised consecutive viral load measurements in patients with COVID-19
hospitalized with a moderate illness. Patients received 400 mg of HCQ every 12 hours for 10 days
according to the medical decision. Nasal swab samples were collected at the 1st, 7th, and 14th days of
the admission. Results: 155 samples were collected from 66 patients with COVID-19 (60%
female), with a median age of 58 years. The viral load between studied groups, assumed as a
semiquantitative measure of cycle threshold (Ct) values, presented no significant difference within
the three consecutive measures (ΔCt) (p>0.05). We also analyzed the

ΔCt viral load at different

intervals of sample collection (Δt <7; 7-12 and >12 days) without significant differences at any ΔCt
(p>0.05). Conclusion: In this study, we did not observe any change in viral load in vivo with the
use of HCQ.

INTRODUCTION
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019
(COVID-19), a pandemic, when the virus reached five continents [1]. Since then, several
medications have been tested in the treatment of this disease such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
[2], tocilizumab [3, 4], remdesivir [5], and heparin [6].
Some studies have already demonstrated the broad-spectrum antiviral potential of HCQ, a drug
widely used as an antimalarial or in the treatment of autoimmune disease [7, 8]. Some studies have
demonstrated the in vitro effectiveness of HCQ and chloroquine in controlling the replication of
SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10].
On May 22, a multinational registry analysis was published with 96032 patients with COVID-19
that received chloroquine alone or combined with a macrolide, as well as HCQ alone or combined
with a macrolide. The study found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ had a
higher risk of death than those in the control group [11]. As a result, WHO advised against
continuing studies with HCQ as an alternative drug for the treatment of COVID-19. However,
several concerns were raised regarding the veracity and analysis of the data conducted by the
authors. Due to concerns involving reevaluation of original data by a new peer review, the authors
could no longer vouch for the veracity of the data and requested the retraction of the paper [12].
Therefore, more studies need to be carried out to understand the real benefit of HCQ in the
treatment of the disease. The present study aimed to evaluate viral load clearance in patients with
COVID-19 who underwent treatment with HCQ in comparison with a control group that did not
receive the drug.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients and drug administration
This prospective study comprised consecutive viral load evaluations in patients with COVID-19. A
total of 155 samples from 66 hospitalized patients at university hospital Sao Paulo, Brazil, aging >
18 years of age, were included in the study. They were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) due to COVID-19. We excluded patients under 18 years old, ICU patients, and
those presenting with severe conditions including malignancy, heart, liver, or renal diseases and
severe decompensation (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), inadequacy for
oral administration, inability to cooperate due to cognitive impairment or poor mental status,
pregnancy or lactation and HCQ allergy. In the original protocol, patients with severe COVID-19
were excluded.
The HCQ was prescribed according to medical decision and acceptance of the patient. A dose of
400 mg HCQ was administered every 12 hours for 10 days. The patients were included after
approval of the study by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (CEP n. 4.013.602).

Samples and RNA preparation
Nasal swab samples were collected from patients during the early (Ct1), intermediary (Ct2), and
final clinical stage of COVID-19 (Ct3), corresponding to the 1st, 7th, and 14th days of the
admission, respectively, to evaluate the viral clearance.
The RNA of samples was purified using the Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research, USA)
according to manufacturer instructions. Purified RNA was stored at -80°C.

SARS-CoV-2 detection
Viral detection was performed with AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Reagents, in a total of 20 µL
reaction volume, containing 5,0 µL of purified RNA, primers and probes (400 nM and 200 nM,
respectively) aiming at the CDC USA protocol N1 and N2 targets of the SARS-CoV-2

nucleoprotein gene, and human ribonuclease P gene (RNAse P) as endogenous control [13].
Samples with Ct values < 40 were considered positive.

Viral load analysis method
We used the cycle threshold (Ct) values as a semiquantitative measure of viral load. The amount of
viral RNA target present in positive samples is inversely proportional to the corresponding Ct value,
meaning that the greater amount of viral RNA, the lower the Ct value obtained.
To assess the Ct value variation along time, consecutive RT-PCR tests were conducted in the
patients with COVID-19, during hospitalization or after discharge, until undetected Ct values. The
variation between consecutive Ct values for each patient analyzed was evaluated as ΔCt.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test (χ2) and two-way ANOVA to compare
categorical values, with a significance level of p <0.05.

RESULTS
Among the 66 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted at São Paulo Hospital, 60%
(40/66) were male. The median age was 58 (range 18-85) years. The patients presented mild to
severe symptoms, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, feverish or not, and received supplemental
oxygen therapy until 5 L/min and, but none were classified as ‘severe’ or ‘critical’, and none were
further admitted to ICU. The majority of patients reported comorbidities such as hypertension,
diabetes mellitus type 2, and dyslipidemia.
The 155 nasal swabs from the 66 patients were collected from first-day symptoms up to the 36th
day. We detected the highest viral loads soon after symptom onset, which then gradually decreased
towards the detection limit at about the second week. Viral loads were very heterogeneous as shown
in Figure 1.

Patients were categorized into two periods according to the timing of sample collection in relation
to illness onset. There was no difference in Ct values obtained from the first samples (p=0.335),
demonstrating the results are homogeneous among the values of the first sample (Table 1).

We compared the median viral load obtained for different clinical stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection

prior to the HCQ administration as an optional drug for treatment. On the other hand, the MannWhitney test (for non-parametric data) was used to analyze the Ct2 and Ct3 value differences
between patients that have used HCQ in comparison to the control group (no HCQ use). The data
are shown in table 2.

Next, we compared patients with use and no use of HCQ according to clearance of viral load (ΔCt)
at intervals between the first and second sample collection (Δt). The two groups were analyzed on
the three intervals defined by data of all subjects sampling over the study. No significant viral load
clearance was observed among the groups (p=0.362 for Δt<7 days, 0.403 for Δt 7-12, and 0.516 for

Δt>12 days, two-way ANOVA test). The data are shown in figure 2.

DISCUSSION
The hypothesis that HCQ could be effective is still open. Although the study with a greater number
of patients did not show differences in outcome [2], the theme remains under discussion even
though the fact that their effect on viral replication is not well understood.
We establish a study to assess viral clearance in patients without a severe outcome so that we could
compare patients more homogeneously. The viral load is an established method used for the
evaluation of therapies and was a biomarker on the study of lopinavir/ritonavir [14]. Viral load
clearance also was used in many studies for SARS-CoV-2 showing a gradual decrease in tertiary
patients [15, 16].
Zou et al. [16] reported that patients with a severe form of COVID-19 who required hospitalization
in an intensive care unit had a high viral load 10 days after the onset of respiratory symptoms and

later as well. Lescure et al. [17] reported the viral load dynamics of two patients who later
developed respiratory deterioration despite the disappearance of nasopharyngeal viral RNA. They
also suggested that the viral load could be used to indicate possible clinical strategies for the
treatment of COVID-19.
We could not find any difference in viral load reduction among samples of patients considering the
same time score established in other studies that analyzed the clearance of viral load in different
clinical presentations. Liu et al. [18] in their study analyzed the clinical outcome of COVID-19
subjects but none patient was under HCQ.
The results of this study must be interpreted in light of methodological limitations. All patients
included were hospitalized with moderate severity neither critical nor mild and the difference in
viral load may be less striking than a large inclusion could demonstrate. In addition, it is possible
that measuring viral load in the nasopharynx may not fully capture the total amount of virus shed by
an individual. Patients were selected based on the availability of samples that had tested positive for
COVID-19. Therefore, the sampling time of all serial samples for each patient presented some
variation. To reduce any bias, we categorized all patients using the ΔCt and Δt analysis to minimize
that limitation.
In conclusion, we did not observe any change in viral load in vivo with the use of HCQ.
