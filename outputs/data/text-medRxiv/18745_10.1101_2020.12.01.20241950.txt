Abstract
Background
The COVID-19 pandemic led to social and physical distancing measures that reduced social contact and
support. We explored whether people with more frequent and supportive social contact had fewer
depressive symptoms during the UK Spring 2020 ‘lockdown’, whether this applied to face-to-face and
remote electronic contact, and whether people with higher empathy levels, or more frequent pre-COVID
social contact with others were more protected.

Methods
UK dwelling participants aged ≥18 in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to
22 weekly questionnaires about frequency of face-to-face and phone/video social contact, perceived social
support, and depressive symptoms assessed with the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed linear
models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined
for interaction by empathic concern and perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency.

Results
In 71,117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15) we found that daily face-to-face or
phone/video contact was associated with lower PHQ-9 scores (mean difference 0.258 (95% confidence
interval 0.225, 0.290) and 0.117 (0.080, 0.154) respectively) compared to having no contact. Those with high
social support scored 1.836 (1.801, 1.871) PHQ-9 points lower than those with low support. The odds ratio
for depression for those with daily face-to-face social contact compared to no face-to-face contact was 0.712
(0.678, 0.747). Daily compared to no phone/video contact was associated with odds ratio for depression
0.825 (0.779, 0.873). And reporting high, compared to low, social support was associated with 0.145 (95%CI
0.138, 0.152) odds ratio for depression. The negative association between social relationships and
depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual
sociability.

Conclusions
Those who had more face-to-face contact during lockdown had fewer depressive symptoms. Phone or video
communication were beneficial but less so. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy
were more likely to have depressive symptoms during enforced reduced social contact. Results have
implications both for our management of COVID-19 and potential future pandemics, and for our
understanding of the relationship between social factors and mental health.

Background
The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related disease (COVID-19) [1] spread globally during early 2020, leading
the World Health Organisation to declare an international public health emergency on 30th January 2020 and
a pandemic on 11th March 2020. Its highly infectious nature and the effect on individuals and health services
caused many countries to initiate physical and social distancing measures and close non-essential businesses
and services. On 16th March 2020, people in the UK were advised against all unnecessary social contact
which included avoiding pubs, clubs, cinemas and restaurants [2]. One week later on 23rd March 2020 a
‘lockdown’ was announced in the UK [3]. These regulations specified that people should not leave home
except for once-daily exercise, medical needs, essential shopping or work. Gatherings of more than two
people were prohibited. This legislation was changed on 1st June 2020 when people living alone were
permitted to meet with one other person outside, again on 13th June when two single-adult households
were allowed to pair with one another and have unlimited contact, and on 4th July two households could to
meet indoors and multiple households could meet outdoors.
The potential detrimental impact on mental health of changes in social relationships resulting from the
lockdown, including reduced frequency of social contact and insufficient social support, has been
acknowledged [4] and noted in previous pandemic quarantines [5]. Social relationships can be measured in
several ways, and commonly is divided into structural social relationships (i.e. the number and type of
people with whom a person interacts), and functional aspects (meaning the qualitative experience of those
interactions, such as perception of social support or loneliness) [6]. Having better structural or functional
social relationships is linked to improved mental health. A systematic review of observational studies found
that perceived support from others was associated with lowered risk of depression and depressive
symptoms [7]. Another added that having more extensive social networks was associated with lower risk of
depression [8]. These associations are found throughout the life-course including in older people [8] and
children and adolescents [9].
The experience of social relationships changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. People turned to remote
methods of communication, with increased use of phone calls - for example average call duration increased
from 3.7 to 5.4 minutes from January to April 2020 in the UK [10] - and higher use of mobile messaging and
video-calling in the UK and throughout Europe[11]. It is important to consider whether these approaches to
maintain relationships were associated with better mental health, as this may guide policy to reduce the
impact of future periods of lockdown during COVID-19 and other pandemics.
Further, whilst there is evidence that richer social relationships are beneficial for mental health, it is unclear
whether the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, where reduction in social contact was
imposed on all UK citizens, impacted the effect of social isolation on mental health. Socially active people

may have suffered more from having social contact involuntarily reduced than those who had infrequent
social contact prior to the pandemic. Furthermore, as reduced social contact was imposed on all for the
purpose of promoting public health, it may have meant that psychological ability to think of others and
conceive of the ‘greater good’ affected the experience of the lockdown. Higher empathic concern for others
is associated with worse mental health, while higher ability to take the perspective of others is associated
with better mental health [12, 13], so empathy may have moderated the effect of impaired social
relationships on mental health, potentially creating high risk groups for psychiatric distress during periods of
lockdown.
Therefore, we aimed to test, in a large prospective study initiated at the start of the UK lockdown, our
hypotheses that poor structural social relationships measured by frequency of face-to-face and phone or
video contact and functional social relationships (measured by perceived social support) would be associated
with more depressive symptoms and higher risk of depression. We used data with repeated weekly
measures of social relationships (exposure) and depressive symptoms (outcome) to give more robust
estimates of the associations and capture changes in social relationships as lockdown regulations changed.
Additionally, we explored whether these associations would be strengthened in those with previous high
sociability and high levels of empathic concern, and ameliorated in those with higher perspective-taking
ability.

Methods
Study design and participants
UCL Research Ethics Committee [12467/005] approved the study and all participants gave informed consent.
We conducted a longitudinal analysis of data from the COVID-19 Social Study [14] of UK-dwelling
participants aged 18 years and older. The COVID-19 Social Study started on 21st March 2020 to consider
social and mental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK at the beginning of the lockdown. The study
was promoted through several routes: large databases of people who had consented to be contacted about
health research; United Kingdom Research and Innovation mental health research networks; media
coverage; and targeted recruitment to increase representativeness to people from low income, low
educational, unemployed backgrounds, and vulnerable groups. Full details of the study protocol are
available at www.covidsocialstudy.org.
Participants were invited by email to complete online questionnaires using the Redcap online survey tool
(https://www.project-redcap.org/). They could enrol in the study at any time after 21st March 2020 and,
following their first extensive baseline questionnaire, received a weekly email until 21st August with a link to
a shorter follow-up questionnaire. Participants who did not complete the weekly questionnaire received two
reminder emails. If they still did not respond to the survey then they were counted as lost to follow-up.

Eligibility criteria for participants in our study were 1) being aged ≥18 years, 2) joining the COVID-19 study
any time between study inception on 21st March 2020 and 21st August 2020, the last date of weekly data
collection, and 3) residing in the UK at the time of baseline questionnaire completion.

Measures
Social relationship variables
Data about social relationships were collected weekly . For structural relationships, we asked:
1) The number of days during the past week on which participants had at least 15 minutes of face-to-face
social contact (including with those with whom they live).
2) The number of days during the past week on which participants had at least 15 minutes of telephone or
video social contact.
We treated face-to-face and virtual contact separately, as responses to the two questions did not correlate (r
= 0.05). Responses were 0-7, and we considered this as a continuous scale, and also categorised into none (0
days), some (1-6 days) and daily (7 days).
For functional relationships we used an adapted version of the six item short form of Perceived Social
Support Questionnaire, which was administered weekly. It has good psychometric properties [15] and we
made minor adaptations to make the language more relevant to experiences during COVID-10 pandemic
(appendix 1). Participants were asked to rate their agreement on a 5 point Likert scale from ‘not at all true’
to ‘very true’ with six statements about their feelings during the past week. Higher scores indicated more
perceived social support. We considered this as a continuous variable and categorised scores into tertiles
based on the distribution of the group (low <3, medium = 3 to 3.99, high ≥4.)

Depressive symptoms
We measured depressive symptoms weekly using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) [16], a standard
instrument for assessing the severity of depressive symptoms in primary care settings. The questionnaire
involves nine items, with responses on a Likert scale of 0 to 3 ranging from ‘not at all’ to ‘nearly every day’
with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. We used the scale as continuous, and also
generated a binary variable as depressed / not depressed using a cut-off point of ≥10 [17].

Potential moderators
Empathic concern and perspective taking
We used 14 questions from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) [18] to evaluate self-reported empathic
concern and perspective taking in one of the weekly surveys during week 13 of the study (13th-20th June
2020). Empathic concern and perspective taking have low-moderate correlation [18] and differential
associations with depressive symptoms [12] so were treated separately in our analyses. The IRI is validated

in the general population and is a measure of ‘trait-based’ empathy aiming to assess long-term, rather than
situational, empathic responses, so does not focus on feelings related to the COVID-19 pandemic [19].
Participants were asked to rate their agreement with statements on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
“Does not describe me well” to “Describes me very well”. Scores for the two subscales were averaged across
each domain giving mean scores for empathic concern and perspective taking. We used this mean score and
categorised tertiles based on the distribution in the sample (low <3.7, medium 3.7 to 4.19, high ≥4.2 for
empathic concern, and low <3.3, medium 3.3 to 3.99, high ≥4 for perspective taking).
Usual social contact
We measured social contact prior to the COVID-19 pandemic at baseline with the question ‘Usually in your
life, how often do you meet up with people face to face socially, not for work (e.g. friends, family, relatives
or social events with colleagues)?’ Participants chose from response options ‘less than once weekly’, ‘once
or twice per week’, or ‘three or more per week’.

Confounders
We used other variables from the baseline interview which we considered from previous evidence to be
potential confounders: age; gender (male, female, other/prefer not to say); ethnicity (White, other); highest
educational attainment (lower secondary (GCSE/O-level or lower), higher secondary (A-level or equivalent),
graduate or higher); living alone or living with others; marital status (cohabiting with partner or spouse,
partner or spouse but living apart, divorced or widowed, single and never married); in employment/study or
retired/not working; annual household income less or more than £30,000.

Analysis
We summarised the demographic characteristics of our sample and on the social relationship variables, and
their correlation using Spearman’s rank test, and depression scale, as well as the potential moderators of
empathic concern, perspective taking and usual pre-COVID social contact.
Association of social relationships with depressive symptoms and depression
We used mixed linear models with a random effect for intercept because data were clustered by individuals
within study week. This method is preferable to statistical approaches that take just a single cross-sectional
time-point for each individual as they allowed us to use all available exposure (social relationships) and
outcome (PHQ-9) weekly data within the period of data collection which was appropriate to allow our
analysis to account for the variation in lockdown restrictions during the study.
We constructed models examining the association, in separate models, of face to face contact, phone/video
contact, or social support with depressive symptoms, which were initially unadjusted (model 1), adjusted for
age and sex (model 2), and additionally adjusted for education, employment status and income (model 3). A

final model (model 4) additionally adjusted for amount of social contact (time-varying), meaning that the
model examining face-to-face contact additionally adjusted for phone/video contact, the model with
phone/video contact additionally adjusted for face-to-face contact, and the model for social support
adjusted for both face-to-face and phone/video contact. We examined the social relationship variables as
both continuous and categorical. We repeated these analyses in mixed effect logistic regression models with
depression as a binary outcome with a cut-point from PHQ-9 of 10, adjusted as in the linear regression
models.
Moderation by empathy and usual social contact
We repeated model 3 of the analysis of social relationships (treated as continuous variables) and depressive
symptoms with the potential moderating variables of empathic concern and perspective taking (as
continuous variables) and usual social contact (as a categorical variable) and interaction terms of these with
the social relationship variables (continuous) in separate models with depressive symptoms outcomes.
Where there was statistical evidence of interaction (p<0.05), we presented results for the association
between the social relationship variables and depressive symptoms stratified according to tertiles of
empathic concern, perspective taking, and the three categories of usual social contact.

Results
We included 71,117 participants who answered 679,615 weekly questionnaires between 21st March and 21st
August 2020; Table 1 details their demographic characteristics . Three quarters (53,026) were women and
the mean age was 49 years (standard deviation (SD) 15). 66,673 (93.8%) were from White ethnic groups and
47,652 (67.0%) had attained graduate or higher educational level. 44,863 (63.1%) were married or
cohabiting with their partner or spouse and 12,735 (17.9%) were living alone. 46,333 (65.2%) were in
employment or full-time education with the remainder not employed or retired.
Of the 69,975 participants (Table 2) who gave baseline information about face-to-face contact, the median
number of days with face-to-face contact at baseline was 7 (interquartile range (IQR) 3, 7), with 44,676
(63.9%) having daily contact and 10,476 (15.0%) having no face-to-face contact during the preceding week.
The median number of days on which participants (n=70,074) had 15 minutes or more of phone/video
contact was 4 (IQR 2,7) with 5,964 (8.5%) reporting no days, 43,022 (61.4%) 1-6 days and 21,088 (30.1%)
reporting daily phone/video contact. Median social support score was 4.0 (IQR 3.2, 4.5) in the 68,784 who
completed this questionnaire at baseline. The correlation between face-to-face and phone/video contact
was 0.05; between face-to-face and social support was 0.27; and between phone/video contact and social
support was 0.21. Mean PHQ-9 score was 7.1 (SD 6.1) and 20,235 of 69,671 participants (29.0%) scored 10 or
more.

Association of social relationships with depressive symptoms and depression
Results from our analyses of the association between social relationships and depressive symptoms are
summarised in Table 3. Each additional day of face-to-face contact was associated with 0.052 (95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.048, 0.057) lower depression score adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics,
and 0.051 (95%CI 0.047, 0.056) when additionally adjusted for phone/ video contact. Having daily contact
was associated with 0.258 (95%CI 0.225, 0.290) lower PHQ-9 score than having no face-to-face contact,
(0.247 (0.215, 0.280) when adjusted for phone/video contact).
Each additional day of phone/video contact was associated with 0.026 (95%CI 0.021, 0.031) lower PHQ-9
score (0.023 (95%CI 0.018, 0.028) when adjusted for amount of face-to-face contact). Having some or daily
phone or video contact was associated with lower depressive symptoms compared to no phone or video
contact when adjusted for face-to-face contact; PHQ-9 scores 0.043 (95%CI 0.013, 0.073), and 0.117 (95%CI
0.080, 0.154) lower for some and daily contact respectively compared to no phone/video contact.
Higher reported perceived social support was associated with lower depressive symptoms: for each
additional point, PHQ-9 score was 1.033 (95%CI 1.018, 1.048) lower in models adjusting for
sociodemographic characteristics and 1.035 (95%CI 1.020, 1.050) when additionally adjusting for amount of
face-to-face and phone/video contact. Those in the highest social support tertile scored a mean 1.836
(95%CI 1.801, 1.871) points lower on PHQ-9 than those in the lowest tertile in fully adjusted models.
A similar pattern of results was seen in multilevel logistic regression models with a binary depression
outcome (Table 4). The odds ratio for depression for people having daily compared to no face-to-face social
contact was 0.712 (95%CI 0.747, 0.678) in models adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and
phone/video contact. Those with daily phone/video contact compared to no contact had odds ratio for
depression 0.825 (95%CI 0.779, 0.873) in fully adjusted models. Reporting high, compared to low, social
support was associated with 0.145 (95%CI 0.138, 0.152) odds ratio for depression, adjusted for
sociodemographic status and face-to-face and phone/video contact.
Moderation by empathy and usual social contact
We repeated analyses with interaction terms for potential moderators, results are described in Figure 1,
which shows the number of points difference on PHQ-9 depression scale associated with one point higher
social relationship score, stratified by level of empathic concern, perspective taking and social contact. We
found an interaction for both empathic concern and perspective taking in the negative relationship between
face-to-face contact and depressive symptoms, with a higher association in participants with higher
empathy. In the 29,567 people who completed the empathic concern section of the IRI, those with high
empathic concern scored 0.068 (95%CI 0.058, 0.077) points lower on PHQ-9 for each additional day of social
contact, compared to those with low empathic concern who scored 0.041 (95%CI 0.033, 0.050) lower with

more social contact. In the 29,701 people who completed the perspective taking questionnaire, participants
with high perspective taking scores scored 0.075 (95%CI 0.066, 0.084) points lower on depressive symptoms
for each additional day of face-to-face contact, whereas those with low perspective taking scored 0.038
(95%CI 0.029, 0.047) points lower with more face-to-face contact. Higher empathic concern and perspective
taking however was linked to smaller association between perceived social support and depressive
symptoms. Those with higher empathic concern and perspective taking reported lower depressive
symptoms with additional social support, compared to those with lower scores on the empathy variables.
We found evidence of interaction between pre-COVID social contact and the relationship between face-toface contact and depressive symptoms. Those who usually had three or more social meetings per week
scored 0.066 (95%CI 0.058, 0.073) points lower on the depression scale with each extra day of social contact
during the lockdown, whereas those who usually met socially with people less than once weekly experienced
less effect on depression with social contact, scoring 0.035 (95%CI 0.026, 0.044) points lower on the
depression scale for each additional social contact. Small differences were seen in the associations between
phone/video contact and depressive symptoms and social support and depressive symptoms according to
level of usual pre-COVID social contact. In these analyses those who usually had more social contact
experienced a marginally smaller effect of having more phone/video contact or social support on depressive
symptoms than those who usually had infrequent social contact.

Discussion
This study explored how structural and functional aspects of social relationships, measured by the frequency
of face-to-face and phone/video contact and level of perceived social support from others, were associated
with depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 related lockdown in the UK. We found that both more
frequent face-to-face and phone/video contact were associated with lower depressive symptoms, including
when mutually adjusted for one another, and in-person contact had more effect than digital contact. Those
with higher levels of perceived social support had lower depressive symptoms and depression risk. These
relationships persisted when adjusted for the amount of actual weekly face-to-face or digital social contact.
Our main finding that having more or better social relationships was associated with lower depressive
symptoms and risk of depression is consistent with the literature. A systematic review of 51 studies, of which
23 were prospective, reported strong consistent findings that having more perceived support from others
and more extensive social networks was associated with lower risk of depression [8]. Establishing the
direction of this association can be challenging. Many studies suggest that having positive and enjoyable
social experiences and recalling socially rewarding information is linked to lower depressive symptoms [20],
that experiencing loneliness is linked to higher threat vigilance which may promote depressive cognitions
[21], and that social support may moderate the effect of stressful life events on health [22]. This has been

confirmed through studies tracking experiences longitudinally, including a recent study of UK older adults
that found greater risk of depression up to 12 years later in those reporting loneliness [23]. However, the
association may be bidirectional as depressive symptoms such as reduced capacity for enjoyment, interest
and concentration, and impaired self-esteem and self-confidence may impair social relationships or a
person’s perception of them. Therefore, associations between self-rated structural and functional aspects of
relationships may partly be a manifestation of depressive symptomatology. What is unique in this study is
that quantity of social relationship was affected by law for everyone in the UK. While people who are
depressed may usually decide not to see people socially, during this period everyone had their social contact
restricted.
Our findings also have specific relevance to the social context of the COVID-19 pandemic, echoing some
previous studies. For example, one cross-sectional study of 7,127 UK older adults aged 70 on average who
self-reported whether their mental health had changed, found that loneliness was associated with reporting
a worsening of depression and anxiety symptoms, although this study did not objectively identify change in
mental health [24]. In our study, the association was relatively modest; the minimum difference on the PHQ9 considered to indicate a clinically meaningful improvement in response to treatment being between 2.8
and 5 points [25]. Associations with depression were stronger for the functional rather than structural
measure of social relationships and persisted when adjustment for structural relationships was included.
This may indicate that it is the quality, rather than quantity, of social relationships which matters most, or
may reflect the overlap between depressive symptomatology and negative judgment about support from
others. Importantly, our study also provided new findings on the relationship between face-to-face vs virtual
communication and mental health.
Some studies conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested similar benefits of video contact. In
a study of young adults, both face to face and video enjoyable interactions were associated with
improvements in self-esteem but face-to-face interaction had a stronger effect [26]. A further study of US
college students reported that affect improved more following in-person communication than digital
communication [27]and another study reported that relationship strength was higher following face-to-face
communication compared to video, audio and text communication [28]. Our study suggests that these
experimental findings apply in a pandemic-enforced lockdown. Face-to-face contact appeared to confer
greater benefit, but when in-person communication was taken into account, remote communication
remained beneficial. Use of social media for communication is common, with 88% of young adults reporting
using it in 2018 [29], and use has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic [10]. Social information
processing theory suggests that frequent use of digital communication over time allows users to convey and
process personal information effectively, despite fewer nonverbal cues than in face-to-face settings [30] so

social contact during the lockdown captured contact with close family and friends, as contact was most likely
with cohabiting people, whereas digital contact was more likely to be with more distant contacts. Therefore
the stronger association of in-person rather than digital communication may have partly reflected the
relationship, rather than the method of contact.
A secondary aim of our study was to explore whether having more empathy for others or usual sociability
affected these associations; the first known study to do this. We found that higher empathic concern for
others was linked to a stronger effect of structural and functional social relationships on increasing
depression, which is consistent with the associations between higher empathic concern and depressive
symptoms [31]. Deprivation of social relationships may be felt more strongly for those who empathise more
with others. Contrary to our hypothesis, higher perspective taking did not attenuate the detrimental effect
of social isolation on mental health and instead, strengthened the relationship. Our hypothesis was based on
studies reporting an inverse relationship between perspective taking and depressive symptoms, usually in
caring groups such as family carers and healthcare workers [12, 13, 32, 33], suggesting that ability to
conceptualise another’s perspective may moderate the experience of their distress. However, our finding
may indicate that people who had others’ perspectives in mind found the lockdown more difficult as, in
these circumstances, they had little agency to act to alleviate others’ situations.
Finally, we report a novel finding that the effect of impaired structural and functional relationships during
the lockdown was associated more strongly with depression in people who were previously more socially
active. Several studies have suggested that unmarried people who live alone have wider and more active
social networks and these have a greater impact on wellbeing for single people than for those in
relationships [34-36]. In our sample, those with less daily face-to-face contact were likely to be living alone
and therefore unable to mix socially with the wide range of people with whom they would normally do so,
and this may have been detrimental to mental health.

Limitations
While our large sample size covered an extensive range of sociodemographic characteristics, it was not
nationally representative with some groups being underrepresented, for example those from lower
sociodemographic groups and minority ethnic groups. However, the potential bias in selection is less
relevant for examining risk factor-outcome associations [37]. All variables were by self-report, so negative
perspectives common in depression may have influenced report of structural and functional relationships,
which would likely overestimate the association.
The questionnaire design, whereby respondents had to answer all questions to proceed to the next page,
meant that there was little missing data for the different questionnaire domains, but participation varied
longitudinally, with around 10% answering only one questionnaire, and only 10% answering all the weekly

questionnaires. Our analysis did not account for attrition which may have been higher in those with
depressive symptoms, and we could only examine moderation by empathy in the smaller sample of
participants who answered that weekly questionnaire. Participants also joined at different stages, with
around 40% joining within the first week of the survey in late March 2020, and others joining at any
subsequent point. Our analytic approach allowed us to make use of all repeated exposure and outcome
variables, and this was particularly relevant for the circumstances of lockdown whereby social contact with
others could vary markedly from week-to-week as new legislation came into force, but our approach makes
it difficult to be certain of the direction of association and reverse causality may have affected our results.
Finally, we lacked detail about the nature of social interactions, such as the duration and intensity of social
contact and there is the potential for residual confounding from unmeasured confounders.

Clinical and research implications
This large longitudinal study of structural and functional relationships and depressive symptoms throughout
the first COVID-19 related lockdown in the UK supports the existing literature that both structural and
functional aspects of social relationships are associated with better mental health. Our study adds that good
quality and supportive face-to-face contact with others is likely to be most beneficial but that, even when
this is not available or permitted, phone and video contact may be beneficial. We also find that the impact of
social isolation may be most hard-felt for those who are usually socially active and more empathic.
These findings have immediate clinical and public health relevance. The UK has already had further periods
of physical and social distancing due to COVID-19 and these are likely in the future, so identifying high risk
groups for negative effects is important. Social isolation is associated with other adverse cognitive [38] and
physical effects [39], so public health policy should facilitate social contact, where possible, to alleviate the
burden on mental health especially for those who live alone and are accustomed to contact with others.
Individuals should use digital methods of communication when in-person meetings are limited. There is need
for actions to improve social connectedness throughout this and potential future pandemics [40] to reduce
the potential for mental illness arising from social isolation.
