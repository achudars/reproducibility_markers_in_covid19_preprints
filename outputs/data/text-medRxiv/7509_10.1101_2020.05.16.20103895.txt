Time series forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases with ARIMA model in the South
East Asian countries of India and Thailand: a comparative case study
Abstract:
Background: As economic burden makes it increasingly difficult for countries to continue
imposing control measures, it is vital for countries to make predictions using time series
forecasting before making decisions on lifting the restrictions. Aim: Since apparent differences
were noted in the disease transmission between the two South East Asian countries of India and
Thailand, the study aims to draw comparative account of the progression of COVID 19 in near
future between these two countries. Methods: The study used data of COVID 19 confirmed
cases in India and Thailand from WHO COVID 19 situation reports during the time period
between 25th March, 2020 and 14th May, 2020. After determination of stationarity in the data and
differencing, observation of autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function
(PACF), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) (2,2,1) model was used to
forecast the COVID 19 confirmed cases in both these countries for two weeks (i.e. 28th May,
2020). IBM SPSS version 20.0 software was used for data analysis. Results: The study
demonstrated a possible increasing trend in number of COVID 19 cases in India in the coming
two weeks with an estimated point forecast of 1,28,772 (95% CI 115023–142520) by 28th May,
2020. A stationary phase was forecasted for Thailand with a difference of only 43 cases between
14th May (the last case of input data) and 28th May. Conclusion: The time series forecasting
employed in the present study warrants thorough preparation on part of the Indian health care
system and authorities and calls for caution with regard to decisions made on lifting the control
measures. The difference in the time series forecasting between these two South East Asian
countries also highlights the need for strengthening of public health systems.

Time series forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases with ARIMA model in the South
East Asian countries of India and Thailand: a comparative case study
Introduction:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is one of the greatest challenges the world has
encountered in recent times. Since the initial reports of outbreak in late December, 2019, the
numbers have been consistently rising with the disease affecting 4.3 million people in 181
countries worldwide as of 15th May, 2020.1 The frailty of a multitude of health care systems
across the globe has been exposed by COVID-19. With the surfacing negative socioeconomic
consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdown affecting the vulnerable,
especially in developing countries, and the plethora of uncertainties around eradication of
COVID-19, governments are eyeing at easing the restrictions that have long been in place.2 It is
imperative to understand that lifting the control measures for economic salvage, without
thoroughly preparing for the possible consequences, may only result in further economic decline
and health crisis. WHO in its strategic advice for countries looking to life the control measures
illustrated six criteria in a sequential manner to be considered: control of transmission;
preparation of health systems for active contact tracing and optimum care provision; careful
management of health facilities to prevent outbreaks; adherence to preventive measures as the
essential services resume; management of importation risks; indoctrination of the ‘new norm’
among communities by active engagement.3 In this scenario, it is vital for countries to make
predictions using time series forecasting. Since apparent differences were noted in the disease
transmission between the two South East Asian countries of India and Thailand, the study aims
to draw comparative account of the progression of COVID-19 in near future between these two
countries.

Methods:
The time series analysis in this study was based on the daily number of laboratory
confirmed cases reported from 25th March, 2020 to 14th May, 2020 collected from the WHO
COVID-19 situation reports.4 In this study Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model, an advanced time series forecasting technique was employed. ARIMA models
decompose the past data basing on the knowledge of past values (autoregressive component),
stabilizing the data pattern (integrated component), and adjusting for the past error terms
(moving average component), which are expressed as p, d, q respectively.5 The data from both
the countries were analyzed in the following manner:

a) inspection for stationarity using

sequence charts and correlograms; b) differencing to transform non-stationary data to stationary;
c) creation of ARIMA models based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial
autocorrelation functions (PACF); d) determination of ARIMA(p,d,q) model fit; e) forecasting
the time series for next two weeks i.e. till 28th May, 2020; f) cross validation of the ARIMA
model by comparison of predicted confirmed cases with the true confirmed cases over the time
period from which the data was collected. IBM SPSS Version 20.0 software (IBM SPSS
statistics for windows version 20, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis.
Results:
Preliminary observation of data from both the countries revealed an upward quadratic
trend. Since the data pattern did not demonstrate stationarity with first order differencing, second
order differencing was done to achieve stationarity. Figure 1 shows the second order differenced
data pattern for both the countries showing stationarity. On observation of ACF and PACF plots
with second order differencing, a single significant spike in ACF was observed at Lag 1 and two

spikes were observed in PACF at Lag 1 and lag 2, which were suggestive of MA(1) and AR(2),
respectively (Figure 2). Based on these observations, ARIMA(2,2,1) modeling was performed.
The model demonstrated good fit (Table 1). Figure 3 shows the ACF and PACF of the residuals
of ARIMA (2,2,1). The number of confirmed cases was forecasted for a period of two weeks in
both the countries (Table 2, Figure 4). Figure 5 shows the cross validation of the performed
ARIMA model by comparing the model predicted confirmed cases with true confirmed cases
from 25th March, 2020 to 14th May, 2020. The high correlation between the predicted and true
values highlights the predictive accuracy of the model. Another important observation from this
study is that the time series forecasting based on past data predict a stationary phase in Thailand,
where as the trend in India was predicted to be considerably rising. According to the results from
ARIMA(2,2,1) forecasting in the present study, the confirmed cases in India by 28th May, 2020
has a point forecast of 1,28,772 (95% CI 1,15,023 – 1,42,520).
Discussion:
The key reason behind comparison of Indian and Thai contexts was to verify if stronger
public health systems, matched for geographical and cultural background to a major extent, can
play a role in successfully fighting the COVID-19 global pandemic. A comparative account of
few indicators comparing the Thai and Indian health care system is provided in Table 3. From a
broader perspective, the distribution of health professionals at different operational levels was
considerably equitable in Thailand regardless of the economic status of the provinces, which
could be a result of the focused health infrastructure development since the past few decades.
Concentration on improving the primary health-care system encompassing optimum number of
health care workers at different operational levels and increasing the financial risk protection, to
ensure financial hardships do not come in the way of accessing quality health care, have been the

most prolific measures adopted by Thailand which made the country set an example for
developing world.6 To compare a few health system related parameters between India and
Thailand, the latter offers health care delivery predominantly through Ministry of Public Health
(MOPH) facilities while the former’s health care delivery is increasingly been privatized. The
appointments of all the health professionals in Thailand are regular, while India has preferred
contractual employment.7 Thailand has special tracks to enroll students from underserved areas
and rural communities into medical schools since 19748; India does not have such mechanisms.
The comparison of nurse and midwifery professionals per 10,000 population and community
health workers between Thailand (27.59 and 10,64,434 respectively) and India (17.271 and
9,70,676 respectively) reveals a huge disparity at these operational levels between the health
systems.9 Moreover, Thailand spends 3.208% of GDP as public health expenditure; whereas
India’s public spending on health care is 1.4% of GDP.10 While it is impossible to ignore the
huge difference in the size of populations between these countries, there are obvious lessons that
Indian health care system can emulate from Thai’s, which include: strengthening public health
care delivery systems; restructuring the medical education system in an informed manner;
preparing health work force at various levels; increasing public health expenditure to at least 3%
GDP.
Conclusion:
The numbers from the time series forecasting employed in the present study warrant
thorough preparation on part of the Indian health care system and authorities and call for caution
with regard to decisions made on lifting the lockdown. While Thailand is preparing for easing
the lockdown restrictions from 17th May, 2020, it is apparent that a fourth lockdown may be
considered in India after 17th May. While COVID-19 certainly has been an unfortunate pandemic

of unprecedented magnitude in recent times, it also poses questions which many systems around
the world have conveniently ignored over the years, and thus provides an important opportunity
for the health systems to revive and restructure.
