Abstract
Background
In the absence of a standard of treatment for COVID-19, the combined use of anti-inflammatory
(corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs may be more effective than using either modality
alone in the treatment of COVID-19.
Methods
Patients hospitalized between April 10th, 2020, through May 10th, 2020, who had confirmed COVID-19
infection with clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, in which 65 patients have moderate
COVID-19 pneumonia, and 63 patients have severe COVID-19 pneumonia. All patients received early
combination therapy of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs. They
assessed for type and duration of treatment, and days need to wean from oxygen therapy, length of
stay, virus clearance time, and complication or adverse events. All patients had more than 28 days follow
up after discharge from the hospital.
Results
Moderate COVID-19 pneumonia group were 65 patients who received Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs,
empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 50
(76.9 %) and female patients were 15 (23.1 %). 34 (52.3 %) patients have comorbidity, 25 (38.5%)
patients have Diabetes Mellitus and 2 (3.1 %) pregnant ladies. 19 (29.2 %) patients were on low flow
oxygen therapy, 3L oxygen or less to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92%. All patients discharged
home with no major or minor bleeding complications or significant complications. Severe COVID-19
pneumonia group were 63 patients who received methylprednisolone, enoxaparin, antiviral drugs,
empirical antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 55
(87.3 %) and female patients were 8 (12.7 %). 37 (58.7 %) patients have comorbidity, and 24 (38.1%)
patients have Diabetes Mellitus. 32 (50.8 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 4-9L oxygen, and
31 (49.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen or more, including 12 patients on a
non-rebreathing mask. Patients received methylprednisolone were 37 (58.7 %) for 3 days, 16 (25.4 %)
for 5 days and 10 (15.9 %) for more than 5 days. Sixty-two patients discharged home with one patient
had a long stay, and the other two transferred to ICU. One long-stay patient transferred to ICU on low
flow oxygen therapy.
Conclusion
Early use of a combined anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs
treatment in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia prevent complications of the
disease and improve clinical outcomes.

Introduction
The Novel Coronavirus 2019 was first reported on in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019. The outbreak
was declared a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020, and on March 11 th,
2020, the outbreak was declared a global pandemic1. The virus has been named severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease it causes has become known as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).1
An estimated 20% of COVID-19 cases are sick enough to require hospitalization, with a subset of 5% of
patients requiring intensive care. Although most reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%).2
Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, about 10-20% of patients are admitted to ICU, 3-10%
require intubation, and 2-5% die.3 As of April 30th, the Case Fatality Rate prediction interval is 0.829.64%.4
To date, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. All the treatment options come from
experience treating SARS, MERS, or some other new influenza virus previously. Treatments are mainly
symptomatic and respiratory support. There is no current evidence from RCTs to recommend any
specific treatment for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
No studies were found explicitly examining the role of steroids for the treatment of the COVID-19
pneumonia. Corticosteroids were widely used in China to prevent the development of ARDS in patients
with COVID-19 pneumonia. Among patients who have been admitted to the hospital with COVID-19
pneumonia, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against the use of corticosteroids. 5 Surviving Sepsis
Campaign guideline on managing critically ill adults with COVID-19 supports using corticosteroids in
mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (but not those
with respiratory failure in the absence of that syndrome) and patients with COVID-19 and refractory
shock; short-course, low-dose regimens are preferred.6
In the absence of a standard of treatment for COVID-19, the combined use of anti-inflammatory
(corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs may be more effective than using either modality
alone in the treatment of COVID-19. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a combination treatment
of anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs to treat severe COVID-19
pneumonia.

Methods
Study setting, patients and Design
This study was done at Al Madinah Al Munawarah Hospital in Al Madinah, Saudi Arabia, from April 10 th
to June 10th, 2020. Patients were received and admitted through the Emergency Department. Cases were
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with findings of pneumonia clinically or radiologically on a chest xray or CT scan. All patients were followed by the infectious diseases team from admission to discharge,
and more than 28 days post-discharge follow up for complications or readmission. All patients signed
informed consent for receiving medical acts and care.

All patients hospitalized between April 10th, 2020 through May 10th, 2020, were eligible for inclusion if
they were 18 years of age or older, had confirmed COVID-19 infection with clinical or radiographic
evidence of pneumonia. Patients were excluded if they were immunocompromised with cancer,
chemotherapy, transplant, or end-stage renal disease on renal replacement therapy.

Definitions:
A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a patient that had a positive reverse-transcriptase–
polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal sample tested by AlMadinah region central lab.
Severe COVID-19 pneumonia defined as confirmed COVID-19 infection, with clinical or radiographic
evidence of pneumonia, and oxygen saturation less than 90 with pulse oximetry.
Moderate COVID-19 pneumonia defined as confirmed COVID-19 infection, with clinical or radiographic
evidence of pneumonia, and oxygen saturation more than 90 with pulse oximetry.

Treatment:
1) Intravenous methylprednisolone: only for severe COVID-19 pneumonia; if the patient needs
more than 10L oxygen therapy, methylprednisolone is 40mg four times daily for 3 to 5 days, if
the patient does not improve, continue until his oxygen saturation becomes more than 90% on
ambient air, then methylprednisolone is tapering to once daily and to be stopped if oxygen
saturation more than 93% on ambient air. If the patient needs less than 10L oxygen therapy,
methylprednisolone is 40mg three times daily for 3 to 5 days if the patient does not improve,
continue until his oxygen saturation becomes more than 90% on ambient air, then
methylprednisolone is tapering to once daily and to be stopped if oxygen saturation more than
93% on ambient air.
2) Enoxaparin treatment according to D-Dimer, patient weight, and severity of pneumonia.

Enoxaparin duration for severe COVID-19 pneumonia is three to five days, if the patient doesn’t improve,
continue enoxaparin until oxygen saturation becomes more than 90% on ambient air, then decrease the
enoxaparin according to his weight, continue enoxaparin until oxygen saturation becomes more than
93% on ambient air, then change enoxaparin dose to 40mg once daily until home discharge.
3) Antiviral drugs were hydroxychloroquine 400 mg every 12 hours for one day, followed by 200 mg
twice daily for 5 – 7 days or Lopinavir/Ritonavir 400/100 mg twice daily for ten days.
4) Empirical antibiotics for pneumonia.
5) Other treatments: standard treatment for comorbidity.
Study Assessments
All patients assessed for type and duration of treatment, days need to wean from oxygen therapy, length
of stay, virus clearance time, and complication or adverse events. All patients had 28 days follow up or
more after discharge from the hospital by mobile phone or emergency department visit for hospital
readmission or complication.
Outcome definitions
1) ICU transfer after admission in the medical ward due to respiratory failure or any reason.
2) Patient discharged home.
3) Long stay mor than 21 days.
4) Death due to any cause.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS for Windows. Statistical analyses of demographics, clinical,
laboratory, treatment, length of stay, virus clearance time, and outcome descriptive data are tabulated.
Descriptive statistics such as means and standard deviation mean (±SD) were used for quantitative
variables, absolute and relative frequency (%) for qualitative variables.
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
Between April 10th to May 10th, 2020, A total of 128 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, in which 65
patients have moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, and 63 patients have severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Table
1 shows the baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups.
Moderate COVID-19 pneumonia group received Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical antibiotics for
pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 50 (76.9 %) and female
patients were 15 (23.1 %). A 34 (52.3 %) patients have comorbidity, 25 (38.5%) patients have Diabetes

Mellitus and 2 (3.1 %) pregnant ladies. A 19 (29.2 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 3L oxygen
or less to maintain oxygen saturation more than 92. 42 (64.6 %) patients received azithromycin, and
hydroxychloroquine treatment and 23 (35.4 %) patients received Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The length of stay
mean was 6.7 days (18 – 3), and virus clearance time mean was 14.3 days (24 – 10). All patients in the
group discharged home with no major or minor bleeding complication or significant complication. All
patients have 28 days follow up, or more after discharge without readmission or complication noticed.
The length of stay was higher among patients with comorbidity, and the mean was 7.08 (18-3) days. It
also was higher among patients who received Lopinavir/Ritonavir only, and the mean was 7.59 (18-3)
days, where the mean was 5.95 (14-3) days among patients received azithromycin and
hydroxychloroquine treatment. Virus clearance time was prolonged among patients had low flow oxygen
therapy with mean of 15.21 (24-10) day and prolonged among patients who received Lopinavir/Ritonavir
only, and the mean was 15.45 (24-10) day, where the mean was 13.14 (24-10) day among patients
received azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine treatment. Patients with comorbidity 13 (8.25%) needed
more Low flow oxygen therapy than patients with no comorbidity.
Severe COVID-19 pneumonia group received methylprednisolone, Enoxaparin, antiviral drugs, empirical
antibiotics for pneumonia, and standard treatment for comorbidity. Male patients were 55 (87.3 %) and
female patients were 8 (12.7 %). 37 (58.7 %) patients have comorbidity, and 24 (38.1%) patients have
Diabetes Mellitus. 32 (50.8 %) patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 4-9L oxygen, and 31 (49.2 %)
patients were on low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen or more, including 12 patients on the nonrebreathing mask. Patients received methylprednisolone were 37 (58.7 %) for 3 days, 16 (25.4 %) for 5
days and 10 (15.9 %) for more than 5 days. 50 (79.4 %) patients received azithromycin, and
hydroxychloroquine treatment and 13 (20.6 %) patients received Lopinavir/Ritonavir. Length of stay
mean was 9.7 days (30 – 3), and virus clearance time mean was 14.3 (27 – 6). A 59 (93.6 %) patients in
the group discharged home with no major or minor bleeding complication or septic shock. The most
common complication was hyperglycemia among diabetic patients. There are two patients transferred
to ICU due to respiratory failure and managed with non-invasive ventilation (BiPAP) for three days, then
transferred back to the medical ward and discharged home. There is one patient in medical ward needs
low flow oxygen therapy and methylprednisolone for more than 21 days due to unknown reason or
confirmed significant lung disease or infection, but Bactrim was given empirically for possible
pneumocystis pneumonia, then improved and discharged home. There is also one patient with diabetes
mellitus and ischemic heart disease transferred to ICU due respiratory failure and managed with an
invasive ventilator for 23 days and ended with a tracheostomy tube and severe lung fibrosis, currently
he is conscious and pulmonary rehabilitation started. All patients have 28 days follow up, or more after
discharge without readmission or complication noticed.
Length of stay was higher among patients with comorbidity, and the mean was 11.30 (30-6) day. It also
was higher among patients who received 10L or more low flow oxygen therapy, and the mean was 12.47
(30-5) day. It also was high among patients who received Lopinavir/Ritonavir only, and the mean was
11.15 (30-7) day, where the mean was 10.06 (30-5) day among patients received azithromycin and
hydroxychloroquine treatment. Virus clearance time was prolonged among patients who had low flow

oxygen therapy with a mean of 15.03 (24-8) day and prolonged among patients who received
methylprednisolone for more than five days, and the mean was 16.20 (24-8) day. Patients with
comorbidity 22 (59.5%) needed more Low flow oxygen therapy, 10L oxygen, or more than patients with
no comorbidity.
D-Dimer level was measured in all patients on admission in both groups—no significant association
between D-Dimer level and hypoxemia, length of stay, or virus clearance time.

Discussion
The clinical course of COVID-19 could be divided into three phases: viremia phase, acute phase
(pneumonia phase) and severe or recovery phase.7
Patients with competent immune functions and without apparent risk factors (old age, comorbidities,
etc.) may generate effective and adequate immune responses to suppress the virus in the first or second
phase without immune over-reaction. In contrast, patients with immune dysfunction may have a higher
risk of failing the initial phase and becoming severe or critical type with higher mortality.8
Therefore, treatment of COVID-19 should be based on the staging of patients, and the window of
opportunity may lie between the first and the second phases, when clinical deterioration is observed
with evidence of abrupt inflammation and hypercoagulable states. With no proved antivirals, early
intervention has mainly focused on the correct timing of disease stages and implementing ways to stop
or slow disease progression. Once the patients enter the critical status, nothing could be relied on other
than comprehensive management.8
The combined use of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs may be more effective than using either
modality alone. Based on in vitro evidence for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication and blocking SARS-Co-2
infection-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production.9
Clinical-Therapeutic Staging Proposal 10,11
•

Stage I: Mild (Early Infection)
Administration of steroid during the early infection could increase viral replication and perhaps delay
development of adaptive immunity. This might be expected to be detrimental.
•
•

Stage IIa: Moderate (Pulmonary Involvement without Hypoxia)
Stage IIb: Moderate (Pulmonary Involvement with Hypoxia)
Low-dose steroid administration during the pulmonary involvement might be expected to be beneficial
(by blunting the severity of inflammation and thereby preventing a severe hyper-inflammation phase).
•

Stage III: Severe (Systemic Hyperinflammation)
For those patients who develop a marked hyper-inflammation phase, low-dose steroid might be
inadequate to treat this. Higher doses of steroid or targeted immunosuppressive (e.g. tocilizumab) could
be necessary to treat established hyper-inflammation. However, higher doses of steroids have greater
side-effects – so delaying steroid administration until Stage III could result in missing the window of
optimal intervention

Low peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (Spo2; with the cutoff of 90%) after receiving oxygen support
along with the presence of dyspnea were found to be a strong predictor of mortality. 12 Exertional
dyspnea, an easily assessed symptom, is associated with death in patients with COVID-19 associated
pneumonia independently of age and sex.12 Among patients who developed severe disease, the mean
duration to develop dyspnea is 5 - 8 days, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from 8 –12 days,
ICU admission is 10 –12 days. Some patients can rapidly deteriorate one week after illness onset.
Mortality among patients admitted to the ICU is 39% –72%, and the Median length of hospitalization
among survivors is 10 –13 days.13,14 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of
mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia.15 Therefore, COVID-19 patients with exertional dyspnea with or
without hypoxia should be admitted to hospitals, evaluated for pulmonary involvement clinically and
radiologically, and treated early with anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs.
Proper management of COVID-19 mandates a better understanding of disease pathogenesis. Two main
features preceding severe respiratory failure associated with COVID-19: the first is macrophage
activation syndrome-like state; the second is defective antigen-presentation driven by interleukin-6.2
The peculiar clinical course of CAP caused by SARS-CoV-2, including the sudden deterioration of the
clinical condition 7– 8 days after the first symptoms, generates the hypothesis that this illness is driven
by a unique pattern of immune dysfunction that is likely different from sepsis. The features of
lymphopenia with hepatic dysfunction and increase of D-dimers in these patients with severe disease
further support this hypothesis.2,16
It was reported that IL-6 and IL-8 could cause hypercoagulation, leading to scattered fibrin clots,
shortening the clot dissolution time, and maximizing the dissolution rate.17 It was also observed that
severe COVID-19 patients had higher levels of IL-6,18, suggesting that the hypercoagulation status of
COVID-19 patients may be related to the elevated levels of cytokines. Pathological observations support
the current concept of a hypercoagulative state in critically ill patients, showing that the frequency of
pulmonary micro-thrombosis is high.19 Because organ dysfunction is mainly limited in lung and virus is
the primary pathogen, the coagulation feature of severe COVID-19 might not be identical with sepsis in
general.20
American Society of Hematology recommends LMWH should be considered in ALL patients (including
non-critically ill) who require hospital admission for COVID-19 infection, in the absence of any
contraindications like active bleeding, platelet count <25×109/L, monitoring advised in severe renal
impairment and abnormal PT or aPTT is not a contraindication.21Despite the lack of quality published
evidence, many institutional protocols have adopted an intermediate-intensity (i.e., administering the
usual daily LMWH dose twice daily) or even a therapeutic-intensity dose strategy for thromboprophylaxis
based on local experience.22
LMWH not only improves the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients but exerts an antiinflammatory effect through reducing IL-6 and increasing lymphocyte%.23

If a MAS-like state exists and excessive IL-6 levels are detrimental, why shouldn't corticosteroids be firstline therapy as these will vigorously suppress IL-6 and a raft of other cytokines? Although the recent
open-label study from Wu and colleagues showed a benefit for corticosteroids, 24 the consensus is that
these should not be used based on clinical experience in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other infections
including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection, where collectively there is evidence for
delayed viral clearance.25 An early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to
severe COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes in a multi-center pre/post
study evaluating the effect of a protocol involving early steroid administration within a health system in
Michigan (including five hospitals).26
In this study, Enoxaparin was given as anti-inflammatory to COVID-19 pneumonia without major or
minor bleeding complications. Enoxaparin dose based on D-Dimer level and oxygen saturation +/methylprednisolone plus antiviral drugs is associated with better outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia.
Enoxaparin was given for three to five days or more until oxygen saturation is more than 93%.
Methylprednisolone 40mg three or four times daily according to the severity of hypoxia. Patients oxygen
saturation often improved to more than 93% on ambient air after 3 to 5 days of methylprednisolone
treatment. During methylprednisolone treatment, oxygen saturation sometimes becomes abruptly
normal, even if patients were on more than 5L oxygen therapy. Hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and
hypokalemia were monitored and treated. Routine sepsis monitoring, including bloodwork and
monitoring for recurrence of inflammation and signs of adrenal insufficiency after stopping
methylprednisolone, were performed. Some patients had high blood pressure, gastritis/duodenitis, and
insomnia during methylprednisolone treatment. The rate of occurrence of infectious complications
increases, and mild infection may become severe and fatal. Corticosteroids may also mask some signs of
current infection. Latent infections may be activated, or there may be an exacerbation of intercurrent
infections due to pathogens, including those caused by Amoeba, Candida, Cryptococcus,
Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pneumocystis, Toxoplasma, and fungal infection. There is one patient who
was given methylprednisolone for more than 21 days, after ten days of steroids therapy, workup for
possible infections were done, no confirmed significant lung disease or infection was found, and Bactrim
was given empirically for possible pneumocystis pneumonia, then improved and discharged home.
Some patients were treated by methylprednisolone for ten days and more due to slowly improved
hypoxemia. Those patients routinely monitored for pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections.
Antiviral drugs available at study time were hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir.
Lopinavir/Ritonavir was given to patients who cannot take hydroxychloroquine because of prolonged
QTc interval, old age, and multiple comorbidities, which explained the prolonged duration of virus
clearance time and the length of stay in hospital inpatients taking Lopinavir/Ritonavir. The antiviral drugs
with evidence of improving COVID-19 pneumonia can be combined with anti-inflammatory drugs to treat
COVID-19 patients in hospitals.
Empirical antibiotics with standard community-acquired pneumonia regimen (ceftriaxone plus
azithromycin or levofloxacin) in moderate COVID-19 pneumonia was given to 48 (73.8 %) patients. Most

patients with diabetes mellitus (especially longstanding and uncontrolled) not improved on standard
regimen or worse after 48 hours of admission, so hospital-acquired pneumonia regimen (Cefepime or
Meropenem or PIP-TAZO + Azithromycin or Levofloxacin) was given and patients improved and
discharged home. Extra days of length of stay, and virus clearance time, higher oxygen therapy among
patients with comorbidity and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. MRSA coverage was given to patients
with a high risk of MRSA and not improved with hospital-acquired pneumonia regimen.
Diabetes is a risk factor for hospitalization and mortality of the COVID-19 infection. Diabetes was a
comorbidity in 22% of 32 non-survivors in a study of 52 intensive care patients. 13 In another study of 173
patients with severe disease, 16.2% had diabetes, and in further study of 140 hospitalized patients, 12%
had diabetes.27,28 When comparing intensive care and non-intensive care patients with COVID-19, there
appears to be a twofold increase in the incidence of patients in intensive care having diabetes.30
Mortality seems to be about threefold higher in people with diabetes compared with the general
mortality of COVID-19 in China.13,29
In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, empirical antibiotics with hospital-acquired pneumonia
regimen (Cefepime or Meropenem or PIP-TAZO + Azithromycin or Levofloxacin) was given because of
steroids therapy. Standard community-acquired pneumonia regimen with steroid therapy was failed
many times because the patients have bilateral pulmonary involvement with hypoxemia. Comorbidity in
severe COVID-19 pneumonia required more oxygen therapy and length of stay. MRSA coverage was
given to patients with a high risk of MRSA and not improved with hospital-acquired pneumonia regimen.
Empirical Bactrim was given once due to the possibility of pneumocystis pneumonia.
CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY
Larger randomized studies and more analysis of patient subtypes to determine benefit from the use of
combined anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral drugs treatment. It is hoped
that the above analysis can provide a testable theoretical framework to allow for advances in our
understanding and control of this deadly viral epidemic.
In conclusion, early use of a combined anti-inflammatory (corticosteroids and Enoxaparin) and antiviral
drugs treatment, an inexpensive and readily available agents, in patients with moderate to severe
COVID-19 pneumonia prevent complications of the disease and improve clinical outcomes. The
combination therapy of anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs can over great benefits to COVID-19
patients with ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and ICU bed and mechanical ventilator shortages.
