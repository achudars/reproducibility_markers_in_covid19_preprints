Immunopathological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 cases in
Guangzhou, China
Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disorder caused by the highly
contagious SARS-CoV-2. The immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19
patients, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present
study, we analyzed both the changes in the cellularity of various immune cell types as
well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate
that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes
including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of
immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild
COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with
severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay
underwent a similar “rise-decline”pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In
conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the
elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disorder caused by a new
coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-21. This virus probably arose from an unidentified
animal source and is subsequently transmitted from person to person2. Transmission
of COVID-19 is through the air by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, or

touching a virus-contaminated object and then touching mouth, nose, or possibly eyes.
COVID-19’s initial manifestations include cough, fever, and respiratory distress. The
thorough clinical profile of COVID-19 has not been completely comprehended.
Reported illnesses range from mild to severe or even death. The severity of COVID19 varies among individual patients during the same outbreak and among patient
groups during different outbreaks in different regions.
The immune response in COVID-19 patients, either systemic or local, has not been
well studied even one month after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Although the
chest CT scan has suggested progressive pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, the
inflammatory process and immune reaction have not been detailed. In one report,
elevation of neutrophil cellularity, serum IL-6, and c-reactive protein was found
together with lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients3. Other clinical studies indicate that
COVID-19 patients develop lymphopenia and high-levels of various cytokines such
as G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-α4, 5. The surge of proinflammatory
cytokines incurred the cytokine storm which might induce viral sepsis and
tissue/organ damages to result in shock or even multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies seem to be produced in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the
mounting of humoral responses3. However, the comprehensive status of either innate
immunity or adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown.
In the current study, we analyzed multiple cytokines and immune cell populations in
the blood of Chinese COVID-19 patients. Our study outlines the immunopathological
profile in COVID-19 patients, and may provide helpful information for developing
future therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Materials and methods
Patients
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangzhou Eighth People’s
Hospital. Thirty-one individuals who were diagnosed to have mild/moderate COVID19 symptoms (17 men, 14 women, average age=44.5), and 25 individuals who were
diagnosed to show severe COVID-19 symptoms (18 males, 7 females, average
age=66) in Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital between January 2020 and February
2020 were enrolled in the study with informed consent. Diagnosis of COVID-19
infection, pneumonia and clinical classification was based on the new coronavirus
pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 6) issued by the National
Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. The clinical classifications are
on the basis of the following manifestations: (1) mild/moderate: fever, respiratory
tract symptoms, and pneumonia on chest CT scan. Respiratory rate > 30 beats/min, or
mean oxygen saturation < 93% (2) severe: one of the following: respiratory distress
with respiratory rate > 30 beats/min, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, the
ratio of partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) < 300,
respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, Shock, ICU admission required
for combined organ failure, pulmonary pathological progression. All patients were
confirmed by the test on upper respiratory throat swab samples using the
standard COVID-19 test kit. Individuals with fever and negative for the SARS-CoV-2
test were recruited as controls.
Sample collection
Two to four milliliters of peripheral venous blood was withdrawn from each patient
into K3 EDTA blood collection tubes. The complete blood cell count was performed

on an XN-A1 automatic blood analyzer (Sysmex). The reagents, calibrators, and
quality controls were from the same vendor.
Flow cytometry assay
To analyze serum cytokines, the whole blood was centrifuged at 500×g for 5 minutes
at 4oC. The serum was carefully harvested and stored at -80oC before analysis.
Multiple serum cytokines were quantified using the Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine Kit II
(Guangzhou Weimi Bio-Tech) following the manufacturer’s manual.
To measure lymphocytes and T cell subsets, 100 µl of whole blood was incubated in
900 µl of Tris-NH4Cl buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 5
minutes to lyse erythrocytes. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
cells were incubated with BD Multitest 6-Color TBNK Reagent or BD Multitest
CD3/CD8/CD45/CD4 (BD Biosciences) following the vendor’s instructions. After
another two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 µl of PBS
To evaluate regulatory T cells, erythrocytes were lysed as described above. The blood
samples were then incubated with FITC-conjugated CD4 antibody, Violet 450conjugated CD127 antibody, Percp-conjugated CD45 antibody, and APC-conjugated
CD25 antibody (5µg/ml each, all from BD Biosciences) for 15 minutes on ice. After
another two washes with PBS, cells were resuspended in 500 µl of PBS.
Samples were analyzed on a BD FACSCanto Plus flow cytometer. Among all
collected events, single events were gated between FSC-A and FSC-H. Cell debris
was excluded and intact cells were then gated from single events based on FSC-A and
SSC. Each cell population was then detected based on the antibody staining.

Results
T cell cellularity is reduced in COVID-19 patients
To assess the general immune status of COVID-19 patients, we first quantified the
absolute number of whole white blood cells (WBC) and immune cell populations in
blood samples of patients at inpatient admission. As indicated in Figure 1A, WBC
number was significantly decreased in mild patients as compared with the control
group. However, WBC number was not remarkably changed in severe patients. Total
lymphocyte number was decreased in severe patients but not in mild patients,
suggesting the lymphopenia severe patients (Figure 1B). Neutrophils were increased
in severe patients but not in mild patients (Figure 1C). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio (NLR), consistent with the change in lymphocytes, was moderately increased in
mild patients and profoundly increased in severe patients, in comparison to the control
group (Figure 1D). To analyze the adaptive immune cell populations, we conducted
flow cytometry analysis on CD45+CD3+ total T cells, CD3+CD4+ T helper cells and
CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Figure 1E). We found a similar decrease in CD45+
lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients (Figure 1F). Total T cell number was significantly
decreased in COVID-19 patients, but no significant difference was observed between
mild and severe patients (Figure 1G). Similarly, CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+
cytotoxic T cells were diminished in COVID-19 patients as compared with the control
group, but no significant difference was found between mild and severe patients
(Figure 1H & 1I). The ratio between CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was not changed
(Figure 1J).
B cells and NK cells are decreased in COVID-19 patients

Other immune cells including CD3-CD19+ B cells, CD3-CD16+CD56+ NK cells and
CD3+CD16+CD56+ NKT cells were also evaluated in blood samples (Figure 2A).
We found that in comparison with the control group, there was a trend of decrease in
B cell cellularity in mild COVID-19 patients, and a notable reduction in B cells of
severe COVID-19 patients (Figure 2B). A similar decrease was also seen in COVID19 patients’ NK cells (Figure 2C). No remarkable change in NKT cellularity was
observed in COVID-19 patients (Figure 2D).
Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are increased in mild COVID-19 patients
Tregs are an important T cell subset for immune tolerance and anti-inflammatory
reaction. In our study, we measured the cellularity of CD3+CD4+CD25+CD127- T
cells which were considered a Treg-enriched population (Figure 3A). We found that
Tregs were increased in mild COVID-19 patients as compared with controls (Figure
3B). There was only a slight increase in Tregs in severe patients (Figure 3B).
IL-2, IL-10, and IL-6 reflect the severity of COVID-19
Cytokines are crucial biomarkers of the progression of various inflammatory disorders
including pneumonia. We characterized the expression of Th1 cytokine (IL-2 & IFN-

γ), Th2 cytokines (IL-4 & IL-10), and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 & TNF-α) in
the blood samples of patients at inpatient admission (Figure 4A). As demonstrated in
Figure 4B, as compared with controls, IL-2 was considerably increased in severe
patients but not in mild patients. IL-4 was remarkably raised in mild patients but not
in severe patients (Figure 4C). IL-6 was significantly increased in severe patients but
not in mild patients (Figure 4D). Like IL-2 and IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α were
significantly increased in severe patients but not in mild patients (Figure 4E & 4F).
IFN-γ, however, showed no significant change in COVID-19 patients (Figure 4G).

We also evaluated the cytokine concentrations relative to the length of stay hospital.
We found that severe patients always had a higher IL-2 level than mild patients in the
same time intervals, and IL-2 reached a peak in severe patients on day 15-20,
followed by a moderate decline. IL-2 was not significantly changed in mild patients
along the stay (Figure 4H). No dramatic temporal change of IL-4 was observed in
either mild patients or severe patients (Figure 4I). The IL-6 level in mild patients was
always very low, while IL-6 was drastically increased in severe patients. Interestingly,
as IL-2, IL-6 stayed at a relatively stable levels within two weeks, and then went up
on day 15-20 followed by a decline back to the initial level (Figure 4J). IL-10, too,
was always higher in severe patients than mild patients. Besides, IL-10 in severe
patients underwent a further up-regulation on day 5-10 and day 10-15, respectively
(Figure 4K). The changes in the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ were almost neglectable
(Figure 4L & 4M), suggesting that they probably are not good indicators of COVID19 severity.

Discussion
The outbreak of COVID-19 poses an urgent demand of understanding the role of
immunity in the progression of viral infection and subsequent pneumonia. As a new
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious probably owing to the virus spread
through asymptomatic-infected individuals6. Until recently, very few publications
characterized the comprehensive changes in the innate and adaptive immunity in
SARS-CoV-2 infected people, although some non-peer reviewed sources such as
Medrxiv released some information.
In the present clinical study, we analyzed almost all immune cell types in both mild
and severe COVID-19 patients. We found lymphopenia consistent with former
reports4, 7, 8. Neutrophils, however, were increased in severe patients. It is noteworthy
that the lymphopenia seemed to arise from a comprehensive reduction of all
lymphocyte populations, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells.
The decrease in blood lymphocytes might be due to the recruitment of reactive
lymphocytes in the lungs. It will be helpful to investigate infiltrating cells in the lungs
to test if the infiltrates are predominantly lymphocytes other than granulocytes.
Another possibility is that lymphocytes are more sensitive than granulocytes to the
disturbed homeostasis and then underwent significant cell death. Whatever the case,
lymphopenia is an indicator of severe COVID-19.
Blood conventional T cells especially CD8+ T cells were reduced even in mild
COVID-19 patients. This phenomenon might suggest the recruitment of reactive antiviral CD8+ T cells into the infection site. According to reported T cell response in
SARS-CoV infection, CD8+ T cell reaction was more frequent and robust than CD4+
T cell reaction9. It is therefore possible that this is also the case in COVID-19. Indeed,
a latest case report shows the sign of excessive T cell activation in COVID-19, as

evidenced by high proportions of HLA-DR (CD4 3.47%) and CD38 (CD8 39.4%)
double-positive T cell fraction5. unpublished data indicate highly expanded clonal
CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild COVID-19 patients, suggesting a
robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19
(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.20026690v1.full.pdf). However, B
cell and NK cell number were also remarkably reduced in severe patients, suggesting
a profound suppression of lymphocytes. Interestingly, Tregs, which play a crucial role
in immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory response10, were elevated in mild patients,
suggesting a possible immunosuppression. In severe patients, the Tregs cellularity
was comparable to that in control individuals, probably due to an overall T cell
deficiency. Although the reduction of lymphocytes is clear, the changes in the
functions of lymphocyte populations remain unknown. In future it will be necessary
to test the functions of distinct immune cell populations, so as to tell whether the
innate or adaptive immunity is activated or impaired in COVID-19.
Recent research reveals the fatal cytokine storm in critical COVID-19 patients.
Increased serum IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNFα were observed in COVID19 patients8. Several cytokine levels were also evaluated in our study. We found that
serum IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α were mainly up-regulated in severe patients,
while the first three cytokines exhibited a more meaningful increase. Thus, serum IL2, IL-6, IL-10 could be used to assess the severity of COVID-19.
Cytokines are produced by both innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells. IL-2
is mainly secreted by activated T cells11, 12. The higher IL-2 level in COVID-19
patients likely reflects T cell activation. IL-6 is a well-known pro-inflammatory
cytokine but it can also act as an anti-inflammatory mediator13. The cellular sources of
IL-6 include myeloid cells, T cells, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, etc14. In

COVID-19 patients, the dramatic increase in IL-6 likely originated from activated
macrophages, consistent with another report3 and similar to the IL-6 up-regulation in
SARS patients15. IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine deriving from
alternatively activated macrophages, Th2 cells, Tregs, etc16. The significant increase
of IL-10 in severe patients might be a negative feedback of the systemic and local
inflammation. It is noteworthy that both IL-2 and IL-6 were dramatically up-regulated
in severe patients on day 15-20 after inpatient admission and then declined. This
similar pattern might suggest the aggravation of the disease and the following
remission caused by therapies. However, more data are in demand to accurately
explain the changes. Surprisingly, IFN-γ, which is a crucial anti-viral cytokine
produced by both CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, NK cells and macrophages17,

18

,

remained at a low level in COVID-19 patients. It has been reported that IFN-γ
participated in the cytokine storm in SARS patients19. Perhaps serum IFN-γ remains
unchanged while IFN-γ in the lung tissue is elevated. More investigations are needed
to test this hypothesis. Moreover, IFN-γ can downregulate the expression of the SARS
coronavirus receptor ACE2 in a lab study20. SARS-CoV-2 seems to bind to the same
receptor to infect target cells21. Hence, the potential effect of IFN-γ against SARSCoV-2 infection needs further research.
In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and
the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.
