LUNG ULTRASOUND FINDINGS IN COVID-19 RESPIRATORY DISEASE AND
CORRELATION TO DISEASE SEVERITY

ABSTRACT
Lung ultrasonography has emerged as a promising imaging modality during the COVID-19
pandemic with potential use in triage, diagnosis, prognosis and disease progression.
This retrospective observational cohort study carried out in a busy urban Emergency
Department in the United Kingdom provides a systematic analysis of lung ultrasound findings
(pleural irregularities, B-lines, consolidations, pleural effusions) in SARS-CoV-2 positive
patients and correlates these findings to disease severity as defined by oxygen-deficiency based
on the Berlin Criteria for ARDS.
Our results show that wide B-lines, as well pleural irregularities and subpleural consolidations
are frequent findings in COVID-19 disease. Lung abnormalities occur bilaterally, interspersed
with normal lung, and without significant predilection for specific lung areas. Wide B-lines are
a strong feature in COVID-19 infection. We also describe a finding of small localised peripleural effusions in 8.3% (95% C.I. 5.9-10.8%) of lung zones.
Disease severity correlates strongly to the frequency of abnormal ultrasound findings. Irregular
pleura and subpleural consolidations increase from 40% (95% C.I. 33.3-46.1%) and 27.7%
(C.I.95% 21.8-33.5%) of zones affected in mild disease to 85.7% (C.I.95% 79.8-91.7%) and
66.2% (C.I.95% 58.1-74.2%) in severe disease. Wide B-lines increase from 15.6% (C.I.95%
10.9-20.4%) to 45.1% (C.I.95% 36.7-53.6%). There is an inverse correlation to the amount of
normal lung seen, decreasing from 57.1% (C.I.95% 50.6-63.6%) to 6% (C.I.95% 2.0-10.1%)
of lung zones.
These results contribute to a more thorough understanding of the lung changes in COVID-19
pneumonia and enhance the evidence base for the application of ultrasound in triage, diagnosis,
treatment, and prognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, first identified in China in 2019,
which spread rapidly across the world with pandemic status declared in March 2020 by the
World Health Organisation(1). Clinically the infection has a broad range of manifestations, but
presents predominantly as a respiratory illness with a wide range of severity, including
asymptomatic cases, mild flu-like symptoms, as well as viral pneumonia, and in extreme cases
ARDS-like illness with a high mortality rate(2).
Evidence from computerised tomography (CT) imaging of the chest showed that COVID-19
respiratory disease gives rise to a classic appearance of patchy peripheral ground-glass
opacities (GGO) with ill-defined margins and inter- and intralobular septal thickening leading
to so-called “crazy paving” cobble-stone patterns. Areas of ground glass opacification and
small consolidations occur bilaterally, peripherally and all lung segments can be involved.
There are also associated pleural abnormalities(3)(4)(5). Whilst CT is the imaging goldstandard for diagnosis and assessment of disease severity in COVID-19 pneumonia, it has
significant disadvantages which become particularly poignant in the setting of a pandemic.
These include radiation exposure which has to be considered particularly in paediatric and
pregnant patients, infection control problems, the need for specialist reporting and the length
of time needed from scan to report.
Since the start if the COVID-19 outbreak, lung ultrasound has attracted significant attention
with a large amount of literature dedicated to its potential use and benefits, especially given the
relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of CXR for the changes typical for COVID-19(6).
The usefulness of lung ultrasound in the context of viral pneumonias has been previously
explored in the H1N1 (swine-flu) and H7N9 (avian influenza) pandemics in 2009 and 2013
respectively(7)(8).
The typical findings seen on lung ultrasound of Covid-19 pneumonia include pleural
irregularities, subpleural consolidations, as well as vertical artefacts known as B-lines, which
signify interstitial abnormalities. B-lines appear in a variety of morphologies, from thin
scattered lines to wide confluent bands that can span an entire rib space. Large consolidations
and pleural effusions are rare(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15). These abnormalities are found in
patchy distribution throughout both lungs and are similar to those described for ARDS. The

changes appear to relate to disease severity with anterior involvement a high predictor of need
for respiratory support (16). Although sensitivity of lung ultrasound for detection of COVID19 lung disease is comparable to CT with 90-94%, its poor specificity, shown to be ranging
between 7-83% with a high dependence on disease prevalence has cast doubt on its usefulness
(16)(17)(18)(19).
Many potential applications have been suggested for the use of lung ultrasound in this
pandemic ranging from triage to diagnosis, disease monitoring and therapeutic guidance,
however none of these applications have found standardisation and validation as of yet. Despite
growing evidence, methodologically sound and detailed studies describing lung ultrasound
findings in COVID-19 are still evolving. Differences in scanning approaches, disease severity
of population scanned, abnormalities examined, and small sample sizes have led to significant
heterogeneity in findings, particularly with respect to irregular pleura and subpleural
consolidations which have been described in ranges from 13% to 100% of
patients(20)(21)(14)(22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(12)(27). With respect to examining sensitivity and
specificity of lung ultrasound, no consensus definition is yet reached as to what constitutes a
scan ‘positive’ for COVID-19 infection(28). In order to characterise and validate the lung
ultrasound features in COVID-19 pneumonia with a view to finding potential abnormality
patterns that may increase specificity, more systematically analysed data is needed
In this retrospective observational cohort study, a 12-zone scanning approach is used to assess
each lung zone for 8 different lung findings (pleural irregularities, B-lines in 3 different
morphologies, large and small consolidations, large and small pleural effusions). The
percentages of total lung zones affected by each abnormality are compared between different
anatomical locations within the lung, and the findings are also correlated to clinical severity
as determined by SpO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratio, with cut-off values based on the Berlin Criteria for the
diagnosis of ARDS(29). The findings from our study could further guide future research into
the utility of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis and prognostication of COVID-19.

METHODS
Selection of patients
Patients who had presented to the ED in a 6-week period (from 15. March to the 30. of April
2020) with symptoms consistent with COVID-19(30) and also had received a lung ultrasound
by one of the ED doctors involved in the study as part of their routine clinical assessment were
considered for the study (n=60). Retrospectively, SARS-CoV-2 infection status as determined
by RT-PCR was ascertained by cross-referencing patient’s notes on e-RecordÔ patient. This
resulted in 44 patients.
Patients were divided into three clinical severity groups based on oxygenation deficit as
determined by SpO2/FiO2 (S/F) ratio: mild (S/F>315), moderate (S/F 148-315), and severe (S/F
<148). The cut-off values were based on the Berlin Diagnostic criteria for ARDS (29) and were
determined using an equivalence calculation for translating PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratios into S/F
ratios as suggested by Rice et al (31)(32) (Table 2).
Ultrasound
Lung ultrasound scans were performed by one of three doctors in the Emergency Department,
one of which was an expert with >5 years experience in POCUS and both other doctors had
completed a formal ultrasound fellowship, as well as ten supervised 12-zone LUNG
ULTRASOUND scans prior to the study. Two ultrasound machines were used in the
department - a SonoSite Xport Ô (FUJIFILM SonoSite Inc, Bothell, WA, USA) with set to
abdominal pre-set with Tissue Harmonic Imaging (THI) and Compound Imaging (CI)
manually turned off , or a GE VenueÔ (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, US) with lung preset. The intercostal spaces were scanned sagitally with a low-frequency transducer (3-5MHz)
at a depth of 13-16 cm. The focal zone was set to the pleural line. Each lung zone was scanned
following a ‘lawn-mower approach’ and the image with most abnormalities was saved. Still
images and clips of each zone were saved for analysis.
Twelve lung zones were assessed where the patients’ clinical condition allowed. Zones were
identified as follows: each hemithorax was divided by anterior and posterior axillary lines into
anterior, lateral and posterior areas, which were further subdivided into superior and inferior
zones, resulting in 6 scanning zones per hemithorax. Labelling was set according to laterality
of hemithorax, R (right) and L (left)), and zones were numbered as 1 and 2 for superior and

inferior anterior zones, 3 and 4 for superior and inferior lateral zones, and 5 and 6 for superior
and inferior posterior zones (Figure 1).
Machines and transducers were doubly disinfected with between patients and protective
hygiene precautions were taken in form of full PPE according to local hospital guidelines.
Review process
Retrospectively, all images and videoclips from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were
anonymised and reported independently by two of the ED clinicians trained in ultrasound
taking part in the study. Reporting was carried out using an ultrasound proforma that was
specifically developed for assessment of COVID-19 lung ultrasound scans in the department
(Figure 2). All abnormalities seen within an intercostal space were taken into account. Reports
were compared for agreement and categorised as ‘agree’ or ‘disagree. In cases of disagreement,
a third doctor with experience in interpreting lung ultrasound scans was consulted and the
consensus result was used. The reports were compared categorically, and inter-rater reliability
was assessed using Cohen’s Kappa.
The sonographic clips or images were scored for the presence of the following ultrasound
appearances: A-line pattern (A), pleural irregularity (P), small peripheral consolidation (<1cm)
(C1), larger consolidation (C2), B-lines: £ 2 isolated (B1), >2 B-lines (B2), thick B-lines
occupying >25% of the pleura at origin or confluent B-lines occupying the entire intercostal
space (B3), and pleural effusions: small (<1cm) (E1), large (E2) (Figure 2) .
Statistical analysis
Frequencies of lung ultrasound findings, as well as 95% confidence intervals were calculated
for each lung ultrasound finding across all scans, as well as across severity categories and
different anatomical lung areas. Results were compared between upper (zones 1&5), middle
(zones 2&3), and lower (zones 4&6) lung areas, as well as between anterior (zones 1&2), lateral
(zones 3 &4), and posterior (zones 5&6), as well as between mild, moderate and severe disease
severities. Pearson’s chi-square tests with 3x2 contingency tables were performed to ascertain
statistically significant differences. Desired p-value thresholds of 0.05 were adjusted using
Bonferroni correction to allow for multiple comparisons. To establish strength of correlation
between lung abnormalities and disease severity, linear regression analysis was performed with

calculation of adjusted Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r). Statistical analyses were carried
out using MS Excel [Version16.41] Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA.
RESULTS
Forty-four patients out of sixty patients who had an initial 12-zone lung ultrasound performed
in the ED as part of their initial clinical assessment were found to be positive for SARS-CoV2 infection and included in the study. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.
The patient demographics included 28 males and 16 females, 22 patients over the age of 60
and 26 having prior cardiovascular morbidities. Dyspnoea was the main presenting complaint
in 36 patients. Patients were grouped into severity groups according to S/F ratios as described
in Table 2, resulting in 18 patients classified as mild, 13 patients as moderate and 13 as severe
disease.
Where possible, 12-zone ultrasound scans were performed, however in some patients, clinical
severity did not allow for repositioning to access all 12 zones. This resulted in scans of a total
of 492 zones which were anonymised and retrospectively independently reported by two
physicians. the inter-rater reliability agreement was 91% with a Cohen’s K value of 0.8.
Frequency of different lung abnormalities
All of the 492 analysed zones were independently assessed for the presence of eight different
ultrasound findings. Overall frequencies and 95% Confidence Intervals (C.I.) were calculated
(Table 3). Overall, the most prevalent findings were irregular pleura (P) and small subpleural
consolidations of less than 1cm depth (C1), found in 59.6% (95% C.I. 25.1-33.1%) and 44.9%
(C.I.95% 40.5-49.3%) of all scans respectively. Wide confluent B-lines, spanning the entire rib
space were also seen in a high percentage of scans (30.1%, 95% C.I. 26.0-34%). Other B-line
morphologies were seen to a lesser extent. Notably, we also demonstrated a proportion of small
peri-pleural effusions (E1) in 8.3% (C.I.95% 5.9-10.8%) of all scans. Large consolidations and
pleural effusions were seen infrequently comprising less than 2.6% of all scans (Figure 3). Each
lung abnormality was found in isolation, as well as together with other abnormalities described
above. Abnormal lung was frequently interspersed with areas of normal lung with A-line
pattern. The abnormalities were found throughout all lung zones and occurred bilaterally
(Figures 4A-C).

Anatomical distribution of lung abnormalities
Different areas of the lung were analysed for differences in distribution of the lung
abnormalities (Table 4). When comparing transverse planes of the lung, i.e. apical (zones 1&5)
vs. middle (zones 2&3) vs. basal zones (zones 4&6). Small peripleural effusions (E1) were
found more commonly in the apical and basal lung zones, seen in 9.3% (C.I.95% 4.9-13.7%)
and 13.2% (C.I.95% 7.9-18.5%) of scans, compared to the middle with 2.9% (C.I.95% 0.45.5%).
When comparing coronal planes of the lung, i.e. anterior (zones 1&2) vs. lateral (zones 2&3)
vs. posterior zones (zones 5&6), small peripleural effusions were seen to a significantly higher
extent in the posterior zones (16.1%, C.I.95% 0.5-21.7%), compared to anterior and lateral
zones showing the finding in 5.7% (C.I.95% 2.3-9.1%) and 4.2% (C.I.95% 1.2-7.2%). Gravitydependent findings such as large pleural effusions (E2) were only seen in basal and
posterolateral zones, found in 6.9% of scans from those zones. Large consolidations were found
to a similar extent in coronal sections of the lung, but showed predilection for basal zones,
occurring in 6.3% (C.I.95% 2.5-10.1%) of basal scans.
All other lung findings that were examined did not display significant differences between lung
zones both, in transverse and coronal planes (Figure 5A,B).
Distribution of lung abnormalities amongst different clinical severity groups
The results of comparing lung findings between clinical severity groups can be found in Table
5. The percentage of A -lines was significantly higher in scans of patients with mild disease,
occurring in 57.1% (C.I.95% 50.6-63.6%) compared to 11.8% (C.I.95% 6.4-17.2%), and 6.0%
(C.I.95% 2.0-10.1%) in moderate and severe severity groups. Conversely, irregular pleura,
subpleural consolidations and confluent B-lines were all found to a significantly higher extent
in the moderate and severe categories than in scans from patients with mild disease. Whereas
irregular pleura was demonstrated in 40.0% (C.I.95% 33.3-46.1%) of lung scans in mild
disease, the frequency rose to 64.7% (C.I.95% 56.7-72.7%) and 85.7% (C.I.95% 79.8-91.7%)
in moderate and severe oxygen deficiency. Small subpleural consolidations were found in only
27.7% (C.I.95% 21.8-33.5%) of mild disease scans, as opposed to 52.2% (C.I.95% 43.860.6%) in scans from the moderate disease category and 66.2% (C.I.95% 58.1-74.2%) of the
severe disease group. Wide B-lines or confluent B-lines spanning entire rib spaces (B3) are
seen in 15.6% (C.I.95% 10.9-20.4%) of mild disease scans, and more than doubled to 38.2%

(C.I.95% 30.1-46.4%) in moderate and 45.1% (C.I.95% 36.7-53.6%) in severe disease (Figure
6A)
Interestingly, small peripleural effusions occurred in a significantly higher percentage of scans
in the moderate disease group (11.8%, C.I.95% 6.4-17.2%) than in patients with mild (4.9%
(C.I.95% 2.1-7.7%) or severe disease (3.8%, C.I.95% 2.4-7.5%).
Linear regression analysis showed a strong negative correlation between A-lines and clinical
severity, with an adjusted Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) of -0.99. A strong positive
correlation was found between pleural irregularity and clinical severity (r = 0.99), and C1 and
clinical severity (r = 0.98). B3 also displayed a positive correlation with clinical severity (r =
0.95) (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION
Our analysis of lung ultrasound scans of COVID-19 positive patients resulted in a clear set of
abnormalities seen on lung ultrasound in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include
pleural irregularities, small peripheral consolidations, a range of B-line patterns from separate
thin B-lines to completely coalesced B-lines resulting in the appearance of a white intercostal
space, as well as small peri-pleural effusions. Large effusions and consolidations were less
prominently featured which reflects findings of other groups.
Pleural irregularities (P) and small peripheral subpleural consolidations (<1cm) (C) are the
most prevalent lung abnormalities found in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. They occur
in all severity groups of infected patients with no predilection for gravity dependent zones.
Both of these abnormalities can be seen frequently in infected patients with normal oxygenation
(mild disease group), but increase significantly in moderate and severe disease, where they
occur 85% and 67% of lung zones respectively.
The inverse relationship found between the occurrence of A-lines and disease severity is
logical, as the amount of interspersed normal lung, demonstrated by A-lines is replaced by
abnormal lung in more severe disease.

Wide, thick B-lines moving with the pleura and occupying a large percentage of the pleural
space have been described before in connection with COVID-19 respiratory disease and have
been coined a variety of terms including ‘waterfall sign’ and ‘lightbeam sign’ (20)(15). Our
findings echo these previous accounts. Wide B-lines that occupy >25% of the pleural space are
seen in all disease severities, but whilst they are seen in about 15% of lung zones in mild
disease, they are seen on more than double this frequency in moderate and further increase in
frequency in severe disease. As disease severity increases, the density and width of these Blines increases and can occupy the entire rib space, creating the appearance of a ‘white lung’.
Although we could not see a statistically significant difference in anatomical distribution of
wide B-lines, we saw a slight preference for posterolateral zones, particularly in milder disease.
The presence of confluent B-lines, particularly white rib spaces in anterior zones appeared to
indicate more severe disease. The small sample size in our study might be responsible for the
lack of detecting a statistical significance.
B-lines indicate alveolar-interstitial abnormalities and are therefore seen in a variety of
pathologies such as pneumonia, pulmonary oedema and interstitial lung disease. From research
surrounding ARDS and pulmonary oedema, the amount of B-lines is linked to loss of aeration
and has been used previously to develop a scoring system to predict disease severity and
progression, assess therapeutic effect, or guide ventilation strategies(33)(34)(35). This appears
to be similar in COVID-19 pneumonia, indicating these lung pathologies share important
characteristics on lung ultrasound. In fact, this is also confirmed by appearances on CT scans,
where alveolar-interstitial syndromes are seen as GGO on CT which is a pathognomonic
finding in COVID-19 lung disease.
It has to be noted that we largely followed practises in the leading literature for the analysis of
B-lines (36)(37)(38). We used simplified semiquantitative numerical evaluation of B-lines,
where B-lines were counted per intercostal space and grouped into 3 categories (B1, B2, B3).
To incorporate the frequent and new finding of wide B-lines into the scoring system, we scored
them as B3 if they occupied >25% of the pleural space at origin. In this context, new consensus
definitions may be required to score B-lines, which may help in differentiating different
aetiologies of lung pathology from COVID-19.
Thin and scattered B-lines (B1) were incorporated in the analysis to elicit their significance in
the context of COVID-19. In different context, it is known that <2 thin B-lines can be found in

lung bases without signifying a disease process(36)(38). Our results did not challenge this
notion with no difference in the B1 pattern seen between disease severities or areas of the lung.
Small (<1cm) localised effusions were a finding in our study which has been noted
previously(20) and has been discussed in expert circles but has not attracted widespread
attention in the literature. These small fluid collections appear to be most prevalent in moderate
disease. The clinical significance of this finding is yet to be elicited but it is conceivable that it
represents localised fluid collections as a result of inflammatory reactions.
Interestingly, when looking at the distribution of lung abnormalities within different areas of
the lung, we could not find significant differences in distribution of lung findings commonly
seen in COVID-19 respiratory disease. This is in agreement with the classic findings seen on
CT describing peripheral GGO with spared areas occurring anywhere in the lung. A slight
preference of abnormalities for posterobasal areas can be seen when gravity-dependent
abnormalities such as larger consolidations and pleural effusions are also taken into account as
has been done in previous studies(9)(20)(11).
With lung changes on ultrasound correlating to disease severity, a scoring system to predict
disease severity or guide therapeutic approaches becomes conceivable. The ‘lung ultrasound
score’ (LUS) described in the context of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema has been suggested
(39) which converts numerically evaluated B-lines into a score to predict disease severity and
progression, assess therapeutic effect, or guide ventilation strategies(33)(34)(35). The LUS
scoring system however does not take into account pleural changes. Others have suggested to
score COVID-19 changes on lung ultrasound based on pleural changes(40), but this approach
neglects B-lines. We propose, that based on the results described here, any scoring system
should negatively weight the presence of A-lines, positively weight pleural irregularities, small
subpleural consolidations and broad B-lines.
It is important to remember that the lung changes seen ultrasound in COVID-19 patients are
not specific to COVID-19 and with the decline in prevalence of this disease caution needs to
be taken for potential over- and misdiagnosis. Other causes of viral pneumonia such as H1N1
(swine flu) or H7N9 (avian flu), have shown similar findings on lung ultrasound (8)(41), and
further research is needed to investigate whether there are distinguishing factors between
different types of viral pneumonias on lung ultrasound. In addition, little is known about the

temporal progression of COVID-19 lung changes which is an important factor in deciding
whether lung ultrasound is as useful for the future evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infection as it
was in the first ‘wave’.
There are several limitations to our study. The sample size was small but given the unique
situation with a fast-evolving pandemic we analysed important lung ultrasound characteristics
in the limited time available and used statistical measures to allow for small sample sizes. In
addition, our most significant findings had non-overlapping confidence intervals which
provides additional confidence in the validity of our findings.
A potential shortcoming is also our classification of disease severity, primarily that the Berlin
criteria classify severity based on PaO2, measured at a PEEP of 5(29). As not all our patients
with mild symptoms were subjected to arterial blood gas analysis, we refer to research
conducted by Rice and colleagues which showed that S/F can be reliably related and converted
to P/F ratio(31). This has also been acknowledged by the authors of the original Berlin
criteria(32). We use the Berlin criteria merely as a guide to classify severity.
In summary, in this study we have systematically analysed the lung ultrasound findings typical
for COVID-19 respiratory disease for their overall frequencies as well as anatomical
prevalence within the lung. Pleural irregularities, small peripheral consolidations and wide Blines occur in all severities of COVID-19 infection, but their frequency also directly correlates
to disease severity as defined by oxygenation deficit. Small localised peripleural effusions are
a feature in COVID-19 respiratory disease.
This information can add to existing data and help validate the use of lung ultrasound in the
context of COVID-19 starting from triage, diagnosis to prognosis and formulation of treatment
strategy. As COVID-19 pandemic progresses, it would be imperative to investigate how long
the lung changes last and whether lung ultrasound could be useful in disease follow-up.
