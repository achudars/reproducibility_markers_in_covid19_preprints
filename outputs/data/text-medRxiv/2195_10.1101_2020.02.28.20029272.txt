Abstract

23

Objective: To identify common features of cases with novel coronavirus disease

24

(COVID-19) so as to better understand what factors promote secondary transmission

25

including superspreading events.

26

Methods: A total of 110 cases were examined among eleven clusters and sporadic cases,

27

and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The clusters included four in

28

Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kanagawa and Wakayama

29

prefectures. The number of secondary cases generated by each primary case was

30

calculated using contact tracing data.

31

Results: Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated

32

secondary cases. The odds that a primary case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed

33

environment was 18.7 times greater compared to an open-air environment (95%

34

confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

35

Conclusions: It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary

36

transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Our findings are also

37

consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in

38

closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

Introduction

41

Although the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China began to

42

decrease in February 2020,1 many countries are struggling with containment of the

43

disease. To effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19, it is vital to identify common

44

features of cases so as to better understand what factors promote superspreading events,2

45

wherein an extraordinarily large number of secondary transmissions are produced by a

46

single primary case. Commissioned by the Minister of the Ministry of Health, Labour,

47

and Welfare of Japan, we collected secondary transmission data with the aim of

48

identifying high risk transmission settings.

49

Methods

50

As of 28 February 2020,3 we examined a total of 110 cases among eleven

51

clusters and sporadic cases, and investigated who acquired infection from whom. The

52

clusters included four in Tokyo and one each in Aichi, Fukuoka, Hokkaido, Ishikawa,

53

Kanagawa and Wakayama prefectures. All traced transmission events were examined in

54

relation to close contact in indoor environments, including fitness gyms, a restaurant

55

boat on a river, hospitals, and a snow festival where there were eating spaces in tents

56

with minimal ventilation rate. The number of secondary cases generated by each

57

primary case was calculated using contact tracing data.

58

Results

59

Of the 110 cases examined, 27 (24.6%) were primary cases who generated

60

secondary cases. Figure 1 shows the distribution of these transmissions, of which the

61

mean and variance were 0.6 cases and 2.5 cases2, respectively. The odds that a primary

62

case transmitted COVID-19 in a closed environment was 18.7 times greater compared

63

to an open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, 57.9).

64

If superspreading events are defined as events where the number of secondary

65

cases generated by a single primary case is greater than the 95th percentile of the

66

distribution (i.e. transmission to three or more persons), then seven of the 110 cases

67

(6.4%) were involved in such events. Six of these events (85.7%) took place in closed

68

environments, and the odds ratio (OR) of superspreading events in closed environments

69

was as high as 32.6 (95% CI: 3.7, 289.5).

70

Discussion

71

It is plausible that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of

72

COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environments are consistent with

73

environmental sampling study4 and also large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such

74

as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and

75

hospital-associated clusters in South Korea5. Our findings are also consistent with the

76

declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments

77

was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease.

78

Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help

79

prevent large case clusters and superspreading events. We hope that with such a

80

reduction in contact the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Japan will be maintained

81

below 1 and contact tracing will be sufficient to contain disease spread.6 As the

82

possibility of confounders and interactions was not assessed in this study, additional

83

studies must be conducted to verify the importance of closed environments as

84

facilitators for transmission of COVID-19.
