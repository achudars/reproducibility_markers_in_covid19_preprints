ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the association between benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use
and mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
Methods: We conducted an observational multicenter retrospective cohort study at AP-HP
Greater Paris University hospitals. The sample involved 14,381 adult patients hospitalized for
COVID-19. 686 (4.8%) inpatients received a BZRA within at the time of hospital admission
at a mean daily diazepam-equivalent dose of 19.7 mg (SD=25.4). The study baseline was the
date of hospital admission and the primary endpoint was death. We compared this endpoint
between patients who received BZRAs and those who did not in time-to-event analyses
adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity and comorbidity) and other
medications. The primary analysis was a Cox regression model with inverse probability
weighting (IPW).
Results: Over a mean follow-up of 14.5 days (SD=18.1), the primary endpoint occurred in
186 patients (27.1%) who received a BZRA and in 1,134 patients (8.3%) who did not. There
was a significant association between BZRA use and increased mortality both in the crude
analysis (HR=3.20; 95% CI=2.74-3.74; p<0.01) and in the primary IPW analysis (HR=1.61;
95% CI=1.31-1.98, p<0.01), with a significant dose-dependent relationship (HR=1.55; 95%
CI=1.08-2.22; p=0.02). This association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions: BZRA use was associated with increased mortality among patients hospitalized
for COVID-19 with a dose-dependent relationship, suggesting a potential benefit of
decreasing dose or tapering off these medications when possible in these patients.

1. Introduction
Global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), has created an unprecedented infectious disease crisis worldwide
(1,2). Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs), including benzodiazepines and Z-drugs,
potentiate the rapid neuroinhibitory effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) in the brain and spinal cord. These medications are commonly prescribed for anxiety
and sleep problems (3) and as muscle relaxants and pre-medications in anesthesia, but are also
effective for treating epilepsy, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and acute behavioral
disturbance (4). Potential deleterious effects associated with these medications are well
documented. Several studies (5–11), although not all (12–15), have found a significant
association between BZRAs and increased all-cause mortality. BZRAs have also been
associated with increased risk of infection (16), including pneumonia (17), asthma
exacerbation (18) and respiratory depression (19).
To our knowledge, there are no data on the association of BZRA use with mortality among
patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Following a recent release by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) of a drug safety communication warning patients and health care
providers about the risks of BZRA use (20), it is important to investigate whether these
medications are associated with increased mortality among patients with COVID-19. If this
were the case, a second unanswered question is whether all BZRAs or specific BZRA
treatments are associated with this risk. This knowledge might help guide clinicians on the
choice of medications for patients with COVID-19 with clinical indications for BZRAs.
In this report, we examined the association between BZRAs and mortality in the
Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Health Data Warehouse, which collects data
on all hospitalizations for COVID-19 in Greater Paris University hospitals since the beginning
of the epidemic. If a significant association were found, we sought to perform additional

exploratory analyses to examine whether this association was specific to all or certain BZRA
treatments. Our primary hypothesis was that BZRA use would be associated with increased
mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in time-to-event analyses adjusting for
patient characteristics (such as age, sex, obesity and comorbidity) and other medications
(other psychotropic medications and medications prescribed according to compassionate use
or as part of a clinical trial). If this were the case, our secondary hypotheses were that this
association would be dose-dependent with higher doses conferring greater risk, and partially
explained by respiratory depression.

2. Methods
2.1. Setting and Cohort Assembly
We conducted a multicenter observational retrospective cohort study at 36 AP-HP
hospitals. We included all adults aged 18 years or over who have been admitted to these
medical centers from the beginning of the epidemic in France, i.e. January 24th, until May 1st.
COVID-19 was ascertained by a positive reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction
(RT-PCR) test from analysis of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. This
observational study using routinely collected data received approval from the Institutional
Review Board of the AP-HP clinical data warehouse (decision CSE-20- 20_COVID19,
IRB00011591). AP-HP clinical Data Warehouse initiatives ensure patient information and
informed consent regarding the different approved studies through a transparency portal in
accordance with European Regulation on data protection and authorization n°1980120 from
National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (CNIL). All procedures
related to this work adhered to the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional
committees on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised
in 2008.

2.2. Data sources
We used data from the AP-HP Health Data Warehouse (‘Entrepôt de Données de Santé
(EDS)’). This warehouse contains all available clinical data on all inpatient visits for COVID19 to any Greater Paris University hospital. The data included patient demographic
characteristics, vital signs, laboratory test and RT-PCR test results, medication administration
data, medication lists during current and past hospitalizations in AP-HP hospitals, current
diagnoses, discharge disposition, and death certificates.

2.3. Variables assessed
We obtained the following data for each patient at the time of the hospitalization through
electronic health records (17,18): sex, age, hospital, obesity, self-reported current smoking
status, any medical condition associated with increased clinical severity related to COVID-19
or BZRA use (21–24), any current psychiatric disorder, any medication prescribed according
to compassionate use or as part of a clinical trial (25), any psychotropic medication, including
any antidepressant (26), mood stabilizer (i.e. lithium or antiepileptic medications with mood
stabilizing effects), and antipsychotic medication, respiratory depression, defined by a
respiratory rate < 12 breaths/min or a resting peripheral capillary oxygen saturation in
ambient air < 90% (25), and other clinical markers of disease severity, defined as having
temperature > 40°C or systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg or respiratory rate > 24
breaths/min or plasma lactate levels higher than 2 mmol/L (25). For these two later variables,
a third category for missing data was added. These variables are detailed in eMethods.

2.4. Benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use
Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. BZRA use was defined as
receiving these medications at baseline, i.e. within the first 48 hours of hospital admission,

and before the end of the index hospitalization or death, to minimize potential confounding
effects of late prescription of BZRAs, which can be used in palliative care. We used this delay
because we considered that, in a context of overwhelmed hospital units during the COVID-19
peak incidence, all patients may not have received or been prescribed their usual medication
regimens the first day of their hospital admission, or this treatment may not have been
recorded at this time.

2.5. Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint was the time from study baseline to death. Patients without an endpoint event had their data censored on May 1st, 2020.

2.6. Statistical analysis
We calculated frequencies of all baseline characteristics described above in patients
receiving or not receiving BZRAs and compared them using standardized mean differences
(SMD).
To examine the association between BZRA use and the endpoint of death, we performed
Cox proportional-hazards regression models (27). To help account for the nonrandomized
prescription of BZRAs and reduce the effects of confounding, the primary analysis used
propensity score analysis with inverse probability weighting (IPW) (19,28). The individual
propensities for receiving any BZRA were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression
model that included patient characteristics (i.e., sex, age, hospital, obesity, current smoking
status, any significant medical condition, and any current psychiatric disorder) and other other
medications, including any medication prescribed according to compassionate use or as part
of a clinical trial and other psychotropic medications, comprising any antidepressant, any
mood stabilizer, and any antipsychotic medication (see eMethods). In the inverse-probability-

weighted analyses, the predicted probabilities from the propensity-score models were used to
calculate the stabilized inverse-probability-weighting weights (28). The association between
BZRA use and the endpoint was then estimated using an IPW Cox regression model. In case
of non-balanced covariates, an IPW multivariable Cox regression model adjusting for the
non-balanced covariates was also performed. Kaplan-Meier curves were performed using the
inverse-probability-weighting weights (29,30), and their pointwise 95% confidence intervals
were estimated using the nonparametric bootstrap method (30).
We conducted five sensitivity analyses. First, we performed a multivariable Cox
regression model including as covariates the same variables as in the IPW analysis. Second,
we used a univariate Cox regression model in a matched analytic sample using a 1:1 ratio,
based on the same variables used for the IPW analysis and the multivariable Cox regression
analysis. To reduce the effects of confounding, optimal matching was used in order to obtain
the smallest average absolute distance across all clinical characteristics between exposed
patients and non-exposed matched controls. Third, to examine a potential indication bias of
prescription of BZRAs in ICUs as a possible treatment for palliative care or as an aid to oral
intubation, we reproduced the main analyses after excluding all patients who had been
hospitalized in ICUs. Fourth, we examined whether our findings were similar in models
imputing missing data using multiple imputation (31) instead of excluding patients with any
missing data as done in the main analyses. Finally, to examine the potential influence on the
results of excluding patients who received BZRA after 48 hours from hospital admission, we
reproduced the main analysis while including all participants who received any BZRA at any
time from hospital admission until the end of the index hospitalization or death, and
considering BZRA use as a time-dependent variable (27). In that analysis, patients who
received any BZRA after hospital admission enter the analysis risk-sets at the time of actual

first initiation of the treatment. In all these analyses, weighted Cox regression model was used
when proportional hazards assumption was not met (32).
We performed several additional exploratory analyses. First, we searched for a potential
dose-dependent relationship by testing the association between daily dose of BZRA received
at baseline (converted into diazepam-equivalent dose (33) and dichotomized at the mean
value) and the endpoint, adjusted for the same covariates as used in the main analysis, among
patients who received a BZRA. Second, we examined whether respiratory depression or other
clinical markers of disease severity may at least partly explain this association by adjusting
successively for these variables. Finally, we examined the relationships between each BZRA
and mortality using the same statistical approach as described for the main analysis.
For all associations, we performed residual analyses to assess the fit of the data, check
assumptions, including proportional hazards assumption using proportional hazards tests and
diagnostics based on weighted residuals (27,34), and examined the potential influence of
outliers. To improve the quality of result reporting, we followed the recommendations of The
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative.
Because our main hypothesis focused on the association between BZRA use and mortality,
statistical significance was fixed a priori at two-sided p-value <0.05. Only if a significant
association were found in the main analysis, we planned to perform additional exploratory
analyses as described above. All analyses were conducted in R software version 2.4.3 (R
Project for Statistical Computing).

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the cohort
Of the 17,131 patients with a positive COVID-19 RT-PCR test who had been
hospitalized for COVID-19, 1,963 patients (11.5%) were excluded because of missing data or

their young age (i.e. less than 18 years old of age). In addition, of the 1,473 patients who
received a BZRA at any time during the visit, 787 were excluded because they were
prescribed it more than 48 hours after hospital admission. Of the remaining 14,381 adult
patients, 686 (4.8%) received a BZRA in the first 48 hours of hospitalization at a mean
diazepam-equivalent dose of 19.7 mg per day (SD=25.4, median=10.0, lower quartile=5.0,
higher quartile=22.9, range=1.85-240.0 mg) (eFigure 1). Of these 686 patients, 41.1%
(N=282) had a prescription of BZRA during a prior hospitalization at AP-HP in the past 6
months, and 36.4% (N=183) received at least two BZRA medications. The median delay from
hospital admission to first prescription of BZRA was 0.94 days (SD=0.55).
PT-PCR test results were obtained after a median delay of 1.2 days (SD=12.7) from
hospital admission date. This median delay was of 1.0 day (SD=11.6) in the exposed group
and of 1.2 day (SD=12.8) in the non-exposed group.
Over a mean follow-up of 14.5 days (SD=18.1; median=7 days), 1,320 patients (9.2%)
had an end-point event at the time of data cutoff on May 1st. Among patients who received a
BZRA, the mean follow-up was 12.8 days (SD=13.1, median=8 days), while it was of 14.5
days (SD=18.3, median=7 days) in those who did not.
All baseline characteristics were independently and significantly associated with the
endpoint. A multivariable Cox regression model showed that age, sex, hospital, any medical
condition, any current psychiatric disorder, respiratory depression and any other clinical
marker of severity were significantly and independently associated with the endpoint (eTable
1).
The distributions of patient characteristics according to BZRA use are shown in Table
1. In the full sample, BZRA use significantly differed according to all characteristics except
for sex ratio, and the direction of the associations indicated older age and greater medical
severity of patients receiving any BZRA. After applying the propensity score weights, these

differences were substantially reduced. In the matched analytic sample, there were no
significant differences in any characteristic, except the greater prevalence of men in the nonexposed group (Table 1).

3.2. Study endpoint
The endpoint of death occurred in 186 patients (27.1%) who received a BZRA at baseline
and 1,134 patients (8.3%) who did not. The crude, unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio
(HR=3.20; 95% CI=2.74-3.74; p<0.001), the primary analysis with inverse probability
weighting (HR=1.61; 95% CI=1.31-1.98; p<0.001) and the multivariable IPW Cox regression
adjusting for unbalanced covariates (HR=1.56; 95% CI=1.29-1.89; p<0.001) showed a
significant association between BZRA use and increased mortality (Figure 1; Table 2). A
post-hoc analysis indicated that we had 80% power in the crude analysis to detect a hazard
ratio of at least 1.27.
In sensitivity analyses, the multivariable Cox regression model in the full sample also a
significant association (HR=1.94; 95% CI=1.45-2.59; p<0.001), as did the univariate Cox
regression model in a matched analytic sample using a 1:1 ratio (HR=1.34; 95% CI=1.081.67; p=0.009) (Table 2). Similarly, the primary analysis using imputed data yielded
significant results (eTable 2), as did that considering BZRA use as a time-dependent variable
and including all patients who received a BZRA at any time during the visit (eTable 3). The
exclusion from the analyses of the patients who had been admitted to ICUs did not alter the
significance of the association (eTable 4).
Additional analyses showed a significant dose-dependent relationship between baseline
daily BZRA dose and the endpoint (HR=1.55; 95% CI=1.08-2.22; p=0.017), based on the
primary IPW analysis. Additional adjustments for respiratory depression, any other clinical
markers of disease severity, or both, resulted in still significant associations, which were of

similar magnitude to that observed in the primary analysis (eTable 5). We found that all
individual BZRAs were significantly associated with increased mortality, except for diazepam
(eTable 6). Following adjustments, there were significant associations of any BZRA other
than diazepam, midazolam, and any BZRA other than diazepam and midazolam with
increased mortality, as compared to not receiving BZRAs (eTable 6). Finally, compared with
any other BZRA treatment, diazepam use was significantly associated with reduced mortality
in the crude analysis (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.86; p=0.017), in the primary analysis (HR,
0.31; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.74; p=0.008), and in the sensitivity analyses (eFigure 2; eTables 6 to
8).

4. Discussion
In this multicenter retrospective observational study involving a large sample of
patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we found that benzodiazepine receptor agonist use were
significantly and substantially associated with increased mortality, independently of patient
characteristics and other medications, and with a significant dose-dependent relationship. This
association remained significant in multiple sensitivity analyses. Secondary exploratory
analyses suggested that most BZRAs could be associated with this risk in these patients.
We found that BZRA use was significantly associated with increased mortality among
patients hospitalized for COVID-19. This association might be explained by several
mechanisms.

First,

although the risk of respiratory depression

associated with

benzodiazepines in the general population is debated and was not found to play a substantial
role in our study, it might be relevant among elderly patients with COVID-19 and in those
with pre-existing comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (35). Second,
benzodiazepines may be associated with an increased risk of secondary infections, and
particularly pneumonia, in patients with COVID-19 (36). Finally, in patients with COVID-19

and known risk factors for delirium (e.g., old age, dementia, multiple comorbidities), BZRA
use may favor the occurrence of this condition (35), which is associated with unfavorable
COVID-19 disease prognosis (37). These results suggest the need to carefully reevaluate the
indication of BZRAs and decrease in dose or taper these medications when possible in
patients with COVID-19, in line with professional guidelines recommendation for most
patients on long-term benzodiazepines (4).
Secondary exploratory analyses indicate that most BZRAs may be associated with
increased mortality among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, except diazepam.
Interestingly, this result could be in line with preclinical findings. A prior study indicated a
role of acid sphingomyelinase/ceramide system in SARS-CoV-2 infections (38) and that the
formation of ceramide-enriched membrane platforms may mediate the entry of the virus into
epithelial cells. Although most BZRAs do not influence cellular ceramide levels, diazepam
has been shown to interact with the acyl coenzyme A binding protein, also known as
‘diazepam binding inhibitor’, a protein that contributes to ceramide synthesis (39,40). This
interaction may result in a reduced activity of the ceramide synthase pathway and, finally,
reduced cellular ceramide concentration, which might possibly explain reduced adverse
effects of diazepam on COVID-19 compared to other BZRAs. However, given the
exploratory nature of these analyses, the observational design of the study and the long halflife of diazepam, this result should be interpreted with caution and other studies are required
to confirm this finding and this potential underlying mechanism.
Our study has several limitations. First, there are two possible major inherent biases in
observational studies: unmeasured confounding and confounding by indication. We tried to
minimize the effects of confounding in several different ways. First, we used an analysis with
inverse probability weighting to minimize the effects of confounding by indication (19,28).
Second, we performed multiple sensitivity analyses, which showed similar results. Finally,

although some amount of unmeasured confounding may remain, our analyses adjusted for
numerous potential confounders. Other limitations include missing data for some baseline
characteristic variables (i.e., 11.5%), which might be explained by the overwhelming of all
hospital units during the COVID-19 peak incidence, and different results might have been
observed during a lower COVID-19 incidence period. However, imputation of missing data
did not alter the significance of our results. Second, inflation of type I error might have
occurred in secondary analyses due to multiple testing. Third, our study cannot establish a
causal relationship between BZRA use and increased mortality. Finally, despite the
multicenter design, our results may not be generalizable to outpatients or other regions.
In this multicenter observational retrospective study, benzodiazepine receptor agonist
use was significantly and substantially associated with increased mortality among adult
patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a significant dose-dependent relationship. This
finding suggests a potential benefit of decreasing dose or tapering off these medications when
possible in these patients. Other studies are needed to confirm this result and determine the
exact mechanisms underlying this association.
