Abstract
In October 2020, an outbreak of at least 50 COVID-19 cases was reported surrounding
individuals employed at or visiting the White House. Here, we applied genomic epidemiology to
investigate the origins of this outbreak. We enrolled two individuals with exposures linked to the
White House COVID-19 outbreak into an IRB-approved research study and sequenced their
SARS-CoV-2 infections. We find these viral sequences are identical to each other, but are
distinct from over 190,000 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These genomes fall as part
of a lineage circulating in the USA since April or May 2020 and detected in Virginia and
Michigan. Looking forwards, sequencing of additional community SARS-CoV-2 infections
collected in the USA prior to October 2020 may shed further light on its geographic ancestry. In
sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 infections collected after October 2020, it may be possible to
identify infections that likely descend from the White House COVID-19 outbreak.
Introduction
After its emergence in late 2019, COVID-19 spread throughout the world, resulting globally in
over 42 million cases and over 1.1 million deaths as of October 25, 2020 ​[1]​. In the United
States alone, there have been over 8.9 million confirmed cases and over 225,000 deaths
reported ​[2]​. COVID-19 has been repeatedly associated with localized outbreaks surrounding
social settings like weddings and bars ​[3] as well as workplaces ​[4]​, including so-called
“superspreader” events. Social events and workplaces, among other exposure settings, are
thought to be driving ongoing transmission in the United States ​[5]​. In October 2020, an
outbreak of COVID-19 was reported surrounding individuals employed at the White House,
individuals attending an event at the White House Rose Garden announcing Amy Coney
Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court and individuals attending other events between
September 26 and September 30, 2020 ​[6]​. As of October 30, 2020, there are at least 50
individuals who have publicly announced cases of COVID-19 linked to this outbreak ​[7]​. The
origins of the White House outbreak have been characterized as “unknowable” ​[8]​.

Due to long incubation times and a spectrum of disease severity, contact tracing of COVID-19
spread is challenging. However, genomic sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing
individuals’ infections offers an alternative avenue for investigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission
and spread ​[9–11]​. This technology enables genomic epidemiology where genetic relationships
among sequenced samples are used to make inferences about how infections are
epidemiologically related. Because SARS-CoV-2 mutates approximately once every two weeks
along a transmission chain ​[9,12]​, it is possible to use patterns of shared mutations to group
viruses and discover transmission relationships.
We applied genomic epidemiology to shed light on the origins of the White House outbreak. We
enrolled two individuals with exposures linked to the White House COVID-19 outbreak into an
IRB-approved research study, collected nasal swabs and sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 virus
from these specimens. These two individuals reported no direct contact with each other in the
days preceding their COVID-19 diagnoses and are independently linked to the White House
COVID-19 outbreak. We refer to these infections as WH1 and WH2. We report here on the
genetic relationships between WH1, WH2 and publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomic data.
Results
Samples WH1 and WH2 were each obtained as an anterior nasal swab from individuals who
had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 shortly after attending event(s) associated with
the White House COVID-19 outbreak. After confirmation of the positive test (Ct = 25 for Orf1b
and S for WH1 and Ct = 25 for Orf1 and S for WH2), we performed genome sequencing on both
samples either using a hybrid capture approach. This sequencing resulted in 550X average
depth-of-coverage of WH1, yielding a consensus genome of 29,857 resolved bases or 99.8% of
reference, and 5575X average depth-of-coverage of WH2, yielding a consensus genome of
29,858 resolved bases or 99.8% of reference. WH1 and WH2 are identical to each other at the
consensus level. They possess 14 mutations relative to the reference strain Wuhan/Hu-1/2019
(241T, 1059T, 1977G, 3037T, 7936T, 14250T, 14408T, 16260T, 18417C, 19524T, 20402T,
23403G, 25563T, 28821A) shown in ​Figure 1​. Of 195,737 publicly available viral sequences,
only WH1 and WH2 share all 14 of these mutations. Genetically identical sequences for WH1
and WH2 support a close epi linkage between these infections and thus support independent
infections from the same outbreak.

These mutations place WH1 and WH2 squarely within circulating genetic diversity in the United
States (​Fig. 2​). WH1 and WH2 belong to Nextstrain clade 20C, which is the clade that
predominates in the USA epidemic ​[13] and additionally belong to Pangolin lineage B.1.26 ​[14]​.
Pangolin lineage B.1.26 is demarcated by mutations C16260T and C28821A and contains
viruses
sampled
from
the
USA,
Canada
and
New
Zealand
(​cov-lineages.org/lineages/lineage_B.1.26.html​). The New Zealand samples comprise a
98-case cluster which was closed in June 2020 and whose source is epidemiologically linked to
the USA ​[15]​.

global placement of WH1 and WH2. Viruses from North America are preferentially sampled with 674
North American viruses (colored as shown in the inset map) and 193 viruses from outside North America
(colored in gray). WH1 and WH2 are shown as larger circles with black outlines. An interactive version of
this figure is available at ​nextstrain.org/community/blab/ncov-wh/background​.

We compared WH1 and WH2 to all sequences available in the GISAID EpiCoV database
[16,17] and identified viruses that are directly ancestral to WH1 and WH2 in a
maximum-likelihood phylogeny (​Fig. 3A​). We find that WH1 and WH2 are descended from
viruses sampled from the USA (Connecticut, Florida, New York, Texas, Washington), Canada
and New Zealand in March and April 2020 with the addition of mutations A1977G, G7936T,
G14250T, T18417C, C19524T and C20402T. There are related viruses that share C20402T
that were sampled in Virginia in August and October 2020, but these possess other distinct

mutations and consequently a molecular clock analysis places the common ancestor of
WH1/WH2 and this sister clade between April and July 2020 (median estimate Apr 5, 95%
confidence interval: Mar 26 to Jul 27) (​Fig. 3B​). More closely related to WH1 and WH2 is a
single sample collected from Virginia in August 2020 that additionally shares A1977G with WH1
and WH2. And still more closely related are three viruses collected from Michigan in October
2020 that additionally share G7936T, G14250T and T18417C. The three Michigan viruses
possess a single differentiating mutation (C27610T), while WH1 and WH2 also possess a single
differentiating mutation (C19524T). A molecular clock analysis places the common ancestor
between these lineages in August or September 2020 (median estimate Sep 26, 95%
confidence interval: Aug 12 to Sep 30).

are colored according to state of sampling for US samples or colored gray if samples were from outside
the US. An interactive version of this figure is available at ​nextstrain.org/community/blab/ncov-wh/lineage​.

These observations suggest a transmission chain leading to WH1 and WH2 from viruses
circulating in the USA in March and April that collects an additional 6 mutations over these 6
months of circulation, consistent with the overall observed rate of molecular evolution of
SARS-CoV-2 and natural Poisson variation ​[9]​. Phylogenetic grouping suggests that this lineage
may have been circulating in Virginia during this time. Notably there are 267 viruses collected
between August and November 2020 from Virgina, 113 viruses from Maryland and 0 from the
District of Columbia. If this lineage was circulating concurrently in DC it would not be picked up
with existing sampling. The closest related viruses sampled from Michigan in October may
represent a recent geographic offshoot or may represent direct geographic ancestry of the WH
lineage.
Discussion
Viral genome sequencing represents a powerful new tool for epidemiological investigation.
However, it generally requires a decent fraction of infections to be sequenced to provide critical
comparisons for the sequence or group of sequences in question. Nonetheless, there are
situations where prompt genome sequencing of even a handful of viral genomes can be highly
informative. For example, in late February 2020, genome sequencing of early SARS-CoV-2
infections in the Washington State area by us and colleagues strongly suggested cryptic spread
of COVID-19 during January and February 2020, before active community surveillance was
implemented ​[9]​.
The USA and the world have sequenced and publicly shared SARS-CoV-2 genomes more
rapidly and at a far larger scale than any previous outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. To date,
over 40,000 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes have been sequenced and publicly shared from the
USA alone ​[16,17]​. These publicly available genomes place WH1 and WH2 along a lineage
circulating (at least) in Virginia and Michigan.
Given their identical genetic sequences, we believe that WH1 and WH2 are closely related
epidemiologically. Given that the individuals in question did not have any direct contact with one
another and both attested exposure at events associated with the White House COVID-19
outbreak, we believe that a shared epidemiological connection through the White House
COVID-19 outbreak is the most parsimonious explanation for their infections’ genetic similarity.
This would imply that the WH lineage identified here was responsible for other infections in the
White House cohort as well. However, we cannot completely rule out that the WH lineage
identified here was circulating more broadly in the DC area and both individuals independently
acquired infections of this lineage outside of White House associated exposure. Further
sequencing of infections from DC and surroundings from this time period would help to
definitively rule out this possibility. Sequencing of additional infections in the White House cohort
would be helpful in this regard as well.

There are currently no other viruses in the GISAID EpiCoV database collected from Washington
DC after August 1, 2020. Retrospective sequencing of samples from Washington DC in this time
period could yield other viruses that are part of the same lineage, but this is far from certain, as
the WH lineage may have been introduced from elsewhere in the US. Generally, there
continues to be substantial backfill of publicly available sequences and it is possible that more
viruses related to WH1 and WH2 will be sequenced and shared in the coming months. In just
the period from November 1 to November 12, 10 additional sequences shared to GISAID have
possessed the mutation C20402T and cluster alongside the WH lineage.
We believe that the WH lineage is likely to be at least relatively rare given its paucity of sampling
in publicly available sequences. Looking forward, this relative rarity should make it possible to
identify infections that likely descend from the White House outbreak. If viruses from November
onwards are discovered that possess the same constellation of mutations as WH1 and WH2,
then the inference would be that these infections are the downstream repercussions of the
sizable October White House outbreak. This has precedent in the downstream impact of a
superspreader event at a business conference in Boston in February, where
conference-associated mutations were later seen at high frequency in the downstream
Massachusetts epidemic ​[18]​.
The COVID-19 pandemic has damaged health and health systems and disrupted society
globally to a degree and with a speed unprecedented since the 1918 influenza pandemic.
Science has made a great many discoveries and innovations since then, with genome
sequencing being a fairly recent addition to the toolkit to combat infectious disease. We, as a
society, have the tools to control COVID-19, they just have to be employed.
Methods
Sample collection
Individuals were enrolled as part of the HAARVI study. All participants completed informed
consent. Previously collected samples, as well as prospectively collected samples, were used
for this analysis. This study was approved by the University of Washington IRB (protocol
#STUDY00000959).
Specimens were shipped to the Brotman Baty Institute for Precision Medicine via commercial
couriers or the US Postal Service at ambient temperatures and opened in a class II biological
safety cabinet in a biosafety level-2 laboratory. Dry swabs were rehydrated with 1 mL low TE,
agitated for a minute, and allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Two 400 µL
aliquots of low TE were collected from each specimen and stored at 4˚C until the time of nucleic
acid extraction, performed with the MagnaPure 96 small volume total nucleic acids kit (Roche)
or MagMAX Viral Pathogen II Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher). SARS-CoV-2 detection
was performed using real-time RT-PCR with a probe sets targeting Orf1b and S with a FAM
fluor (Life Technologies 4332079 assays # APGZJKF and APXGVC4APX) multiplexed with an
RNaseP probe set with a HEX fluor (Life Technologies A30064 or IDT custom) each in duplicate
on a QuantStudio 6 instrument (Applied Biosystems).

Sequencing
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was conducted using a hybrid-capture approach. RNA was
fragmented and converted to cDNA using random hexamers and reverse transcriptase
(Superscript IV, Thermo) and a sequencing library was constructed using the Illumina TruSeq
RNA Library Prep for Enrichment kit. For hybrid capture, we used the Ct value as a proxy for
viral load to balance the samples and pooled 24-plex with Seattle-based samples for the hybrid
capture reaction. Capture pools were incubated overnight with probes targeting the
Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, synthesized by Twist Biosciences. The manufacturer’s protocol was
followed for the hybrid capture reaction and target enrichment washes. The hybrid capture pools
were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq instrument using 2x150bp reads. The resulting reads
were assembled against the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (Genbank
accession MN908947) using the bioinformatics pipeline ​github.com/seattleflu/assembly​. The
consensus genome sequence of WH1 was deposited to the GISAID EpiCoV database as strain
USA/DC-BBI1/2020 with accession EPI_ISL_603248 and the consensus genome sequence of
WH2 was deposited to the GISAID EpiCoV database as strain USA/DC-BBI2/2020 with
accession EPI_ISL_605791. Consensus genome sequences for both WH1 and WH2 are also
available from ​github.com/blab/ncov-wh​.
Analysis
Consensus genome sequences of WH1 and WH2 were combined with SARS-CoV-2 genomes
downloaded from GISAID ​[16,17] and processed using the Nextstrain ​[13] bioinformatics
pipeline Augur to align genomes via MAFFT v7.4 ​[19]​, build maximum likelihood phylogeny via
IQ-TREE v1.6 ​[20] and reconstruct nucleotide and amino acid changes on the ML tree. Branch
lengths were temporally resolved using TreeTime v0.7.4 ​[21]​. The resulting tree was visualized
in the Nextstrain web application Auspice to view resulting inferences. Workflows to reproduce
phylogenetic trees shown in ​Figure 2​ and ​Figure 3​ are available from ​github.com/blab/ncov-wh​.
