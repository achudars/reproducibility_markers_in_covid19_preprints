Abstract
Severe

COVID-19

patients

frequently

acute

hospitalization

including

mechanical ventilation at ICU due to acute respiratory distress. A high proportion of these patients
will develop ICU-acquired weakness and a need for rehabilitation. However data on rehabilitation
outcomes in these patients are scarce and the efficacy of rehabilitation remains essentially unclear.
We therefore compared the rehabilitation outcomes between COVID-19 patients with pneumonia
and other patients with common pneumonia to assess their rehabilitation efficacies.

We retrospectively compared the performances of six-min walk test (6MWT), chronic respiratory
questionnaire (CRQ), and functional independence measure (FIM) at the discharge from pulmonary
rehabilitation between 51 Covid-19 patients and 51 patients with common pneumonia using linear
regression controlled for baseline values at entrance, age, sex and cumulative Illness rating scale.

quality of life compared to control patients with common pneumonia is however remarkable. Further
studies need to evaluate whether this discrepancy is an indicator of chronic disease development.

Introduction
Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to hospitalization due to COVID-19 pneumonia. A considerable
proportion of these patients need mechanical ventilation at ICU due to acute respiratory distress and
will develop ICU-acquired weakness [1, 2]. Recently increasing evidences suggest that COVID-19
patients

after

hospitalization

may

still

have

abnormal

pulmonary

function

[3],

low

physical

functioning and impaired performances of daily life activities [4], and persistent fatigue [5]. So there
are increasing rehabilitation needs for COVID-19 patients who continue to suffer from the long-term
consequences of COVID-19. Therefore, European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Societycoordinated International Task Force published an interim guidance on rehabilitation for COVID-19
patients in the hospital and post-hospital [6]. However this guidance is not based on data but reflect
experts’

recommendations

due

to

the

lack

of

data

on

the

safety

and

efficacy

of

rehabilitation

programs. Since the number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is exponentially increasing, both,
the patients and healthcare professionals cannot wait for published randomized controlled trials
before starting the rehabilitative interventions. So far, only one pilot study reported that current
pulmonary rehabilitation used for pneumonia patients can improve physical performance in six-in
walk test (6MWT) of critical COVID-19 patients who were admitted to ICU [7]. In this study, the
efficacy of rehabilitation outcome remained unclear for two reasons. First, the outcome data were
not compared to a control group. Second, assessment of the minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) [8, 9] is missing making it difficult to estimate the relevance of clinical improvement. Thus, it
remains unclear whether rehabilitation programs applied to COVID-19 patients can achieve similar
improvements

in

the

physical

functioning

and

quality

of

life

as

compared

to

other

pneumonia

patients.

We

therefore

investigated

the

clinical

course

of

COVID19

patients

during

rehabilitation

and

compared the outcomes of physical performance (i.e., 6MWT), functional independence measure
(FIM) [10] and chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ) [11, 12]

to matched cases suffering from

other types of pneumonia who attended the same rehabilitation program. We were specifically
interested in the proportion of patients who failed to achieve a clinically relevant improvement as
indexed by the MCID and the impact of ICU-treatment for their outcome.

Method
We retrospectively investigated a cohort of 51 COVID-19 patients with pneumonia referred from
acute care hospitals to inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation at Department of Pulmonology, Clinic
Barmelweid AG from March 23

rd

th

to May 29

2020. We compared these COVID-19 patients with 51

consecutive pneumonia patients (“common pneumonia”), who did the same rehabilitation protocol
in 2019 in our clinic. Patients received standard pulmonary rehabilitation [13], defined after the
national requirements from medical faculty [14]. The common pneumonia patients in the control
group were selected according to following criteria: 1) older than 40 years; 2) no history of thoracic
and/ or pulmonary surgery; 3) complete set of outcome data; and 4) did not repeat the rehabilitation
program in 2019. All Patients gave written general consent for using their data for research purpose.
The patients’ data were

anonymised before analysis. This study

was approved by

the

scientific

committee of Academy Barmelweid.

Physical performance (6MWT), CRQ, and FIM were measured at the entrance and at discharge from
the rehabilitation program (see Table 1). The mean values (IQR) of COVID-19 patients were compared
to the ones of the common pneumonia control group both at entrance baseline and at discharge.
The improvements in 6MWT, CRQ and FIM calculated as the differences between discharge and the

baseline were compared between the two groups. The numbers of patients whose improvements
reached the established MCID: 30-m for 6 MWT [15] and 10-point for CRQ were also calculated in the
two groups. We chose 10-point for CRQ because we used the original score of CRQ which has a full
score of 140 points. This 10-point equalled to the 0.5-point MCID if it was converted to the 0-7 points
system [16].

Odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to compare the binary parameter
between the control group and the COVID-19 group (Fisher’s exact test). Non-parametric Wilcoxon

test

was

used

to

compare

the

numerical

variables

between

the

two

groups

if

their

distributions were not normal. The normality was tested by Shapiro-Wilk test. For numerical variable
with normal distribution, we first compared its variances between the two groups (F-test). Then two
sample t-test or Welch two sample t-test was applied if it had equal or unequal variance between the
two groups, respectively. Fisher’s exact test was applied to test whether the OR of non-improvement
(i.e.,

failed

in

MCID)/improvement

(i.e.,

achieved

MCID)

in

6MWT

and

CRQ

at

discharge

were

different between the two groups. The significance level was P-value<0.05.

Linear regressions were used to compare whether the 6MWT distance, FIM and CRQ scores were
different between the two groups at discharge, after controlling their values at entrance baseline,
age, sex and cumulative Illness rating scale (CIRS). We further tested whether the outcomes of our
rehabilitation program were different between severe and the critical patients (i.e., non-ICU vs. ICU)
using linear regression after controlling the aforementioned variables. This subgroup analysis can test
whether the similar efficacy of the rehabilitation outcome can be also achieved in critical COVID-19
patients because many COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU during hospitalization and these
patients

are

more

likely

to

have

higher

and

longer-term

healthcare/rehabilitation

burden.

All

statistical analyses were done using R (version 3.2.4).

Results
Patient demography
Patients` demography at the entrance is shown in Table 1. Most of our COVID-19 patients were male
and younger than controls. They had higher CIRS scores at entrance, probably because more COVID19 patients were treated at ICU and had mechanical ventilation compared to control group. COVID19 patients had higher odd to have the comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes and acute respiratory
distress

syndrome

(ARDS),

while

the control

group

had higher odd

of having comorbid chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Outcome of rehabilitation: COVID-19 patients vs. common pneumonia patients
At baseline the two groups had similar performance in 6MWT while COVID-19 patients had better
CRQ and FIM scores (Table 2). The changes in the performances of 6MWT, CRQ and FIM compared to
baseline in each patient are shown in Fig.1, indicating that the majority of patients improved in both
groups. Paired t-tests confirmed that both groups had significantly improvements in 6MWT, in CRQ,
and in FIM (Table 2). At discharge COVID-19 patients achieved better performances in 6MWT and
FIM but similar CRQ scores after our rehabilitation program compared to control group (Table 2).
Likewise COVID-19 patients tended to have higher degree of improvement in 6MWT compared to the
control group, whereas the increase in CRQ and FIM were similar in both groups with no significant
differences (Table 2).

Considering the differences in age, sex and CIRS scales at baseline between the two groups, we
performed a regression analysis to test whether the outcomes at discharge were still significantly
different after controlling for these variables and for the baseline performances. The results are

shown in Table 3. Data of 37 COVID-19 and 47 control patients were used to build the regression
model of 6MWT after deleting patients with missing values and outliers defined by nonparametric
boxplot. The numbers of patients were 21 and 51 for the model of CRQ, 44 and 49 for the model of
FIM, respectively.

There were no

significant differences in the 6MWT

performance

and CRQ at

discharge between these two groups, but COVID-19 patients had on average 4.16 points higher (Pvalue=0.00364) in FIM score compared to control group.

Next we compared the number of patients who did not achieve clinically relevant outcome according
to MCID.

A proportion of 7.5% (3/40) COVID-19 and 21.3% (10/47) control patients failed to meet

MCID of 6MWT after the rehabilitation program. Fisher's exact test showed that the OR of nonimprovement/improvement between the COVID-19 and control groups was 0.30 (95% CI: 0.05-1.31,
P-value=0.13). So the odd of no improvement in 6MWT in COVID-19 group was not different from
the one of the control group, although the proportion appeared to be smaller in the COVID-19 group
(i.e., 7.5% vs. 21.3%).

An even higher proportion of 42.9% (9/21) COVID-19 patients did not reach MCID of CRQ after the
rehabilitation program. This number was 19.6% (10/51) in the control group, resulting in an OR of
3.02 (95% CI: 0.87-10.64, P-value =0.075) of non-improvement/improvement in CRQ between the
COVID-19 and control groups, i.e., the odd of no effect in improving CRQ showed a trend to be 3.02
times higher in COVID-19 group compared to the control group. In the nine COVID-19 patients who
failed in MCID six patients were critical ill at ICU and intubated for mechanical ventilation, six patients
were male and four patients were without ARDS. These smaller numbers of patients limited us to
further explore which factors may predict the failure of improving CRQ via regression analysis.

Outcome of rehabilitation: COVID-19 patients ICU vs. non-ICU
Data of 23 critical COVID-19 patients who were treated at ICU and 14 severe COVID-19 patients who
were not at ICU were used to build the regression model of 6MWT after deleting patients with
missing values and outliers. The dependent variable was the 6MWT at discharge, and age, sex and
CIRC scales and baseline 6MWT performance were controlled in the model. The results are shown in
Table 4 below. There was no significant difference in the 6MWT at discharge between the two
subgroups, indicating that the physical functioning outcome of our rehabilitation program is similar
between critical and severe COVID-19 patients.

Similarly, 13 and eight COVID-19 patients treated at ICU vs. not treated at ICU were used to predict

2

the CRQ at discharge (Table 4). Although the fitting of the model was relative poor (i.e., R =0.40)
probably due to the relative small number of patients, the results still suggested that there was no
difference in CRQ at discharge between the two subgroups.

The numbers of patients were 26 and 18 in the ICU subgroup and non-ICU subgroup respectively for
the model of FIM at discharge. Again, there was no significant difference in FIM scores at discharge
between these two subgroups (Table 4).

conclude that in-house rehabilitation is effective and suitable for most COVID-19 patients admitted
from hospitals for acute care [18]. Remarkably critical-ill COVID-19 patients treated at ICU could
obtain

a

similar

outcome

after

rehabilitation

compared

to

COVID-19

patients

not

mechanically

ventilated at ICU. Therefore pulmonary rehabilitation is indicated for a fast improvement even after
critically-ill Covid-19 infection.

The strength of our study is twofold. It is to our best knowledge the first study on the efficacy of
COVID-19 rehabilitation with a control group and considers the clinically relevant improvement as
outcome parameter after rehabilitation. Based on our data we are worried by two findings: Firstly,
the discrepancy of high physical improvement of COVID-19 patients but their relatively low gains of
disease related quality of life (CRQ) compared to the control group. This finding is not explained by a
ceiling effect of the CRQ since COVID-19 patients started at a high level of CRQ – as they did for
physical

performance

-

but

stayed

far

below

the

maximum

scores

at

the

end

of

rehabilitation

program. Secondly, compared to controls we found a relatively high proportion of 42.9% of COVID-19
patients who failed to improve during rehabilitation. This is again most impressive for disease related
quality of life. The reasons why rehabilitation was not effective in such a considerable proportion of
patients cannot be fully explained by our data. These patients may develop a chronic disease or
rehabilitation program may need adaptions to be optimized for disease specific aspects of COVID-19
rehabilitation. Recent available data indicate that COVID-19 patients after acute care hospitalization
still suffer low physical functioning and impaired performances of daily life activities [4]. Whether this
is

related

to

persistent

abnormal

pulmonary

function

[3]

and/or

persistent

fatigue

[5]

remains

unclear. It is also well known that patients with ARDS which was highly prevalent in our COVID-19
group still show disability after years [2]. If a similar chronic course is confirmed for the COVID-19
pandemic, whole world societies need to consider a strong impact on health care systems in the
future.

An interesting finding is that the rehabilitation outcome of our COVID-19 patients is not determined

predictor of rehabilitation outcome.

Our study may be limited by a selection bias, since we do not know the clinical course of patients
referred to

other institutions (e.g. nursery

homes) or went

to ambulant rehabilitation.

Another

limitation is CRQ has not been validated for COVID-19 patients, which may also partly explain our
results of relative low MCID in CRQ in COVID-19 group compared to the control group. But it is still
likely to give an overview of the burden of disease [12] and should be urgently validated in COVID-19
patients considering the exponential growth of the pandemic. Third, the control group was selected
from the pulmonary department to provide comparable well established assessment tools. We thus
could not fully consider the consequences of COVID-19 associated vascular complications in our
study.

Figure 1.

The performances of 6-min walking test (A), chronic respiratory questionnaire (B) and

functional impairment measurement (C) in each patient at the baseline (i.e., entrance) and at the
discharge of our pulmonary rehabilitation. In general the performance improves in both control
group (left) and the COVID-19 group (right).
