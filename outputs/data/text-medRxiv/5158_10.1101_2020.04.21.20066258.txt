Abstract
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is becoming an increasing global health issue
which has spread across the globe. We aimed to study the effect of corticosteroids in
the treatment of adult inpatients with COVID-19.
Methods
A retrospective cohort of 115 consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to The
Third People’s Hospital of Hubei Province between Jan 18, 2020, and Feb 28, 2020
was analysed to study the effectiveness of corticosteroid. They were categorized
according to whether or not corticosteroid therapy was given, and compared in terms
of demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory indicators and clinical
outcomes. The primary endpoint was defined as either mortality or intensive care unit
(ICU) admission. Known adverse prognostic factors were used as covariates in
multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their confounding effects on outcomes.
Results
Among 115 patients, 73 patients (63.5%) received corticosteroid. The levels of age,
C-reactive protein, D-dimer and albumin were similar in both groups. The
corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%) and statistically
significant

differences

were

observed

(p=0.013).

In

multivariate analysis,

corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of either
mortality or ICU admission, although not statistically significant.
Conclusion

No evidence suggests that adult patients with COVID-19 will benefit from
corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment.
Introduction
The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an emerging infectious
respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)[1], started in Wuhan, China in november 2019 and swept over
multiple countries and regions worldwide. With regards to the treatment of
COVID-19, no specific approaches so far are available[2].
The use of corticosteroids remains controversial. During the outbreaks of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and middle east respiratory syndrome
(MERS)-CoV, corticosteroids were widely used[3]. Similarly, physicians tend to use
corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 in addition to other
therapeutics[4]. However, someone had been sceptical about its curative effect,
especially in higher dosages, which carry long-term side effects. According to current
World Health Organization (WHO) guidance[5], Russell[2] recommend that
corticosteroids should not be used in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury or shock
unless indicated for another reason.
We performed a retrospective cohort study on the effect of corticosteroid in a
group of patients (age≥18years) with COVID-19, aimed to provide a scientific and
rational medical decision-making basis for clinicians.

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included individuals who were
diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 consecutively between Jan 18, 2020,
and Feb 28, 2020, at The Third People’s Hospital of Hubei Province. Eligible patients
were those aged 18 years or older infected with SARS-CoV-2, which was diagnosed
by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for
nasal or pharyngeal swab specimens[6].
All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed and classified
according to the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial
version 7) developed by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of
China[7]. In this study, patients with mild or moderate symptoms were classified as
noncritical, and patients with severe or critical symptoms were classified as critical.
Procedures
All patients were treated in the SARS-CoV-2 infection isolation wards. Their
oxygen saturation and vital signs were closely monitored. Chest CT scans, laboratory
indicators including serial haematological ,biochemical tests, coagulation parameters
and inflammation-related factors were performed.
All patients were empirically treated with intravenous moxifloxacin at 0.4g per
day for atypical and typical pneumonia, arbidol was given at a dose of 0.2g every 8 h ,
together with intravenous ribavirin at 0.5g every 12h as antiviral therapy.
Corticosteroid therapy was commenced at the discretion of the attending clinicians
after informed consent had been obtained from the patients themselves or their next of
kin. The options for the corticosteroid regimen were: pulse intravenous

methylprednisolone 0.5-1.0g per day for 2-3 days; or intravenous methylprednisolone
at 1-3 mg/kg per day for 3-10 days. Other treatment options included immunoglobulin,
interferon-alpha, traditional chinese medicine or any combination of the above.
Outcome
The primary endpoint was the occurrence of an adverse outcome, which was
defined as either mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
Data Collection
115 consecutive adult patients fulfilling the criteria of COVID-19 were studied.
Their demographic characteristics, epidemiological history, comorbidity, clinical
features, chest imaging results, laboratory indicators, corticosteroid treatment options
and clinical outcomes were obtained from electronic medical records. The data
collection forms were reviewed independently by two experienced physicians.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were given as frequency rates and percentages; continuous
variables were defined using mean, median, and interquartile range (IQR) values. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify the normality of distribution of
continuous variables. The independent sample t test or the Mann-Whitney U test was
used for the continuous variables and the Chi-Square test or Fisher-Exact test for
categorical variables. The known adverse prognostic factors for COVID-19 mortality
including old age[8-10], male[10-12], presence of comorbidities[10] , high D-dimer
levels[8, 13], high lactate dehydrogenase levels[13, 14], high C-reactive protein
levels[9], low lymphocyte count levels[14-17] ， low serum potassium[18] and

albumin[14] were used as covariates in multiple logistic regressions to adjust for their
confounding effects on adverse outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 24.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A 2-tailed P<0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.
Results
A total of 136 patients older than 18 years old were diagnosed with COVID-19
infection between Jan 18, 2020, and Feb 28, 2020. No abnormal chest imaging was
present in 8 patients. Thirteen patients were transferred to other hospitals. After
excluding ineligible patients, 115 patients were included in the study (Figure 1).
There were 60 noncritical and 55 critical cases among 115 enrolled COVID-19
patients. The median age of all patients was 59 years (IQR, 40-67), and 58 (50.4%)
were men. Of the 115 patients, 42 (36.5%) had 1 or more comorbidities. The most
common symptoms at initial stage of illness were fever (111[96.5%]), fatigue (72
[62.6%]) and dry cough (63 [54.8%]). Less common symptoms were nausea or
vomiting and headache. Compared with noncritical cases, critical cases were
significantly older (median age, 65 years [IQR, 56-69] vs 46 years [IQR, 33-62] ; P
<0.001) and were more likely to have underlying comorbidities. Seventy-three cases
(63.5%) received corticosteroid of various dosages. Steroid therapy for patients was
heterogeneous, with 31 (51.7%) noncritical patients and 42 (76.4%) critical patients
receiving corticosteroids (Table 1).
Twenty-nine (25.2%) of our patients reached the adverse outcomes of ICU
admission or mortality. Patients with adverse outcomes were older and had more

comorbidities. Their lymphocyte counts and albumin levels were lower, their
D-dimer , C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher (Table 2).
When patients were categorized according to whether corticosteroid treatment
was given, and compared in terms of outcomes, as well as age comorbidities and other
established adverse prognostic factors[8-10, 12-16, 18], the corticosteroid group was
found to had more comorbidities, lower lymphocyte count and higher LDH The age,

sex, serum potassium, albumin, D-dimer and C-reactive protein vel were similar in
le

both groups. The corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%),
and statistically significant differences were observed (p=0.013) (Table 3).
Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for the confounding effect of
disease severity. Patients who were treated with corticosteroid were found to have a
2.155-fold increased risk of either ICU admission or mortality, although not
statistically significant (Table 4).
Discussion
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury are partly
induced by host immune responses[4]. Corticosteroids could suppress inflammation,
but the pathogen clearance and immune response are also inhibited at the same
time[19]. Systemic inflammation has been associated with adverse outcomes in
SARS-CoV infection[20] and inflammation also persists after viral clearance[21]. In
theory, corticosteroid administration can be applied to suppress lung inflammation.
However, in a meta-analysis[3] of corticosteroid use in SARS patients, only four
studies provided conclusive data and indicated harm including psychosis[22],

viraemia[19], diabetes and avascular necrosis[23, 24]. In a retrospective study
reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, patients given
corticosteroids were more likely to obtain vasopressors, mechanical ventilation and
renal replacement therapy[25]. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis[26] in
influenza revealed increased mortality in patients who were given corticosteroids.
This report, to our knowledge, is the first cohort study to describe a role for
corticosteroid in patients with COVID-19. In our series, wenty-nine (25.2%) patients
t

reached the adverse outcomes of ICU admission or mortality. The adverse prognostic
indicators were similar to those in other studies, including old age[8-10] and high
C-reactive protein levels[9]. Despite similar age and C-reactive protein levels, the
corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (32.9% vs. 11.9%) and statistically
significant

differences

were

observed

(p=0.013).

In

multivariate analysis,

corticosteroid treatment was associated with a 2.155-fold increase in risk of adverse
outcome, although not statistically significant. This may be due to a small sample size
and multicollinearity, or the characteristics of the sample. Whatever the reason, no
clinical data exists to indicate that net benefit is derived from corticosteroids in the
treatment of COVID-19.
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small. The
results could have been biased by some unknown confounding factors. Second, we
did not stratify the outcomes according to various corticosteroid dosages, methods and
lasting periods.

No evidence suggests that adult patients with COVID-19 will benefit from
corticosteroids in this study. Considering the severe complications triggered by
glucocorticosteroid such as psychosis[22], viraemia[19], diabetes and avascular
necrosis[23, 24], the patients might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment.
More studies are need to evaluate the clinical curative effect, as well as the
appropriate dosages and duration of corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19.
