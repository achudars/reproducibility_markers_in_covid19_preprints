Abstract
Immune cell dysregulation and lymphopenia characterize COVID-19 pathology in moderate to
severe disease. While underlying inflammatory factors have been extensively studied, homeostatic
and mucosal migratory signatures remain largely unexplored as causative factors. In this study we
evaluated the association of circulating IL-6, soluble mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule
(sMAdCAM) and IL-15 with cellular dysfunction characterizing mild and hypoxemic stages of COVID19. A cohort of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (n=125) at various stages of disease progression
together with healthy controls (n=16) were recruited from COVID Care Centres (CCCs) across
Mumbai, India. Multiparametric flow cytometry was used to perform in-depth immune subset
characterization and to measure plasma IL-6 levels. sMAdCAM, IL-15 levels were quantified using
ELISA. Distinct depletion profiles, with relative sparing of CD8 effector memory and CD4+
regulatory T cells was observed in hypoxemic disease within the lymphocyte compartment. An
apparent increase in the frequency of intermediate monocytes characterized both mild as well as
hypoxemic disease. IL-6 levels inversely correlated with those of sMAdCAM and both markers
showed converse associations with observed lympho-depletion suggesting opposing roles in
pathogenesis. Interestingly, IL-15, a key cytokine involved in lymphocyte activation and
homeostasis, was detected in symptomatic individuals but not in healthy controls or asymptomatic
cases. Further, negative association of plasma IL-15 with depleted T, B and NK subsets suggested a
compensatory production of this cytokine in response to the profound lymphopenia. Finally, higher
levels of plasma IL-15 and IL-6, but not sMAdCAM, were associated with longer duration of
hospitalization.

Introduction:
The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to pose a
global health crisis in spite of ongoing interventions such as vaccination (1, 2). Pathology of COVID19 displays varied clinical manifestations ranging from no symptoms to critical systemic disease (3–
5). Hypoxemia is a key signature that discriminates between mild and moderate to severe
disease(6, 7). The role of lymphopenia as a defining cellular immune correlate of moderate to
severe disease has been well established (8). However, underlying immune homeostatic
mechanisms that might contribute to this phenotype remain largely unexplored (9, 10).
Understanding and identifying such relationships would help to guide therapeutic efforts and
vaccine strategies to ensure optimal disease management of COVID-19. In this study we evaluated
the contribution of key inflammatory, cellular homeostatic and mucosal migratory markers in
distinct stages of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our results highlight associations of IL-6, IL-15 and
sMAdCAM with lymphopenia together with a heretofore undescribed role for detectable plasma IL15 as marker associated with symptomatic progression.
Results:
Demographic and Clinical characteristics of study participants
A total of 125 admitted hospital patients, laboratory-confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection
by quantitative RT-PCR of throat and nasal swab samples were recruited for the study. According to
the clinical management protocol for COVID-19 (Version 3) issued by Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India, patients were recruited into different groups based on clinical
severity(7). The patients without evidence of breathlessness or hypoxia were classified into Mild
group. Mild patients were further segregated into Asymptomatic Mild (AS; n=47) and Symptomatic
Mild (SM; n=57) where SMs presented mild symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, headache etc.
Patients with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of < 93% on room air who required oxygen support to

correct hypoxemia, were classified as having Moderate (MD; n=10) COVID-19, whereas patients
with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of < 90% on room air were considered as having Severe (SV; n=11)
COVID-19. In addition, a total of 16 healthy participants with no apparent history of COVID-19 and
seronegative (SN) by Rapid antibody test, were also recruited as controls. The demographic and
clinical characteristics of all the study participants is summarised in Table 1.
Lymphopenia with relative sparing of Treg and CD8+ effector memory subsets define hypoxemic
COVID-19 progression.
The absolute counts of total lymphocytes and T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) in MD and SV groups
were significantly decreased compared to AM, SM and SN (Supplementary figures S1 and S2A).
Additionally, SV group also showed significant depletion of total lymphocytes compared to MDs.
Similar depletion profiles (in MD and SV groups) were observed for both T (CD4+ and CD8+) and
non T (B and NK) cell compartments. However, no significant difference was observed among mild
patients (AM & SM) and compared to SN (Supplementary figure S2B-G). No apparent difference in
the frequency of these lymphocyte subsets was observed except for a significant decrease for total
T lymphocytes and a significant increase for total non-T lymphocytes in both MD and SV compared
to other groups (Supplementary figure S2H-M). This suggested a pan lymphopenic phenotype that
was observed in hypoxemic (MD and SV) individuals. Additionally, to evaluate the impact of
lymphopenia on T cell compartment, distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets was also
evaluated(11). Based on the surface expression of CD45RA and CCR7, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
differentiated into Naïve (TN; CD45RA+CCR7+), Central memory (TCM; CD45RA-CCR7+), Effector
memory (TEM; CD45RA-CCR7-) and Terminally differentiated (TTD; CD45RA+CCR7-) T cells
(Supplementary figure S3). While both MD and SV groups had significant depletion of absolute
count for all CD4+ T cell subsets (Figure 1A), our findings do not support preferential depletion of
any particular subsets in the CD4+ T cell compartment (Figure 1B). In CD8+ T cell compartment,

comparison of absolute counts revealed profound depletion of all subsets in hypoxemic (MD and
SV) individuals (Figure 1C). In contrast to the CD4+ T cell compartment however, we observed
relatively lower frequency of naïve (CD8+ TN) and concomitant elevation of effector memory (CD8+
TEM) frequency (Figure 1D). This reflected a distinct depletion profile for CD8+ T cells with relative
sparing of effector memory cells.
Interestingly, while memory subsets of CD4+ T cell compartment seemed to be equally depleted in
hypoxemic individuals, we report here depletion in Treg count that was exacerbated in the SV
group (Figure 1E). Also, elevated frequency of CD4+ T regulatory cells in hypoxemic individuals
indicated selective preservation of this subset (Figure 1F). When the non-lymphocyte monocyte
compartment was evaluated we observed an elevated frequency of the intermediate
(CD14+CD16++) subset that defined both mild (AM, SM) and hypoxemic patients (Figure 1G).
Contribution of sMAdCAM and IL-6 to COVID-19 associated lymphopenia
To assess the contribution of known soluble inflammatory cytokines and mucosal migration
markers to the observed cellular immune signatures we undertook the evaluation of circulating IL-6
and sMAdCAM levels in our cohort. As expected, we observed elevated IL-6 levels, with the highest
being observed in hypoxemic individuals, in plasma of all groups compared to seronegative controls
(Figure 2A). Additionally, extending our previously reported results(12) obtained with sMAdCAM in
mild infection, we observed a progressive decline in these levels across mild as well as hypoxemic
patients that seemed converse to the pattern observed for IL-6 (Figure 2B). Indeed, the levels of
these 2 markers were significantly negatively correlated (Figure 2C). Further, it was interesting to
note that neither in the case of IL-6 or sMAdCAM was it possible to discriminate between AM and
SM individuals. Next, correlation analysis was undertaken to delineate putative relationships
between the aforementioned soluble markers and cellular subsets described above
(Supplementary Figure S4). Intriguingly and reflective of their apparently divergent relationship,

both IL-6 and sMAdCAM showed significant opposing correlations with absolute counts of
lymphocytes, T cells (CD4+ and CD8+), B cells and NK cells supporting their clear, albeit, opposing
roles in COVID-19 associated lymphopenia (Figure 2 D-I). We also noted a unique negative
correlation of IL-6 with Treg counts together with a heretofore unreported positive correlation of
sMAdCAM levels with CD8+ effector memory T cell counts (Supplementary Figure S5A-B). Elevated
LPS levels, associated with microbial translocation and severe COVID-19 disease were observed in
hypoxemic individuals (Supplementary Figure S5C). Furthermore, and possibly related to altered
monocyte frequencies observed ex vivo (Figure 1G), a negative correlation of sMAdCAM levels
occurred with frequencies of intermediate monocytes (Supplementary Figure S5D). Gut pathology
associated markers LPS and sMAdCAM were poorly correlated with only the latter exhibiting major
correlations to lymphopenia.
Plasma IL-15 levels discriminate symptomatic and asymptomatic mild COVID-19
Having observed distinct depletion profiles of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the relative sparing of CD8+
effector memory T cells and non T cell lymphopenia (B and NK cells) we surmised that IL-15, a
major homeostatic and activation cytokine for these subsets needed to be evaluated in COVID-19
pathogenesis. We observed elevated levels of circulating IL-15 in lymphopenic, hypoxemic
individuals and remarkably, as shown in Figure 3A, in symptomatic mild but not asymptomatic
patients. All hypoxemic individuals had detectable levels of IL-15 followed by 70% of individuals
with symptomatic infection and only 18% (2 out of 11) with asymptomatic infection (Figure 3B).
Indeed, of the 2 asymptomatic individuals that had detectable levels of IL-15 at sampling, one later
progressed to hypoxemia. No individuals within the SN control group had detectable levels of
plasma IL-15. Underlying a strong role for this cytokine, possibly related to homeostatic
repopulation in lymphopenia we observed significant negative correlations between depleted
subsets and circulating IL-15 levels across all groups of COVID-19 affected individuals (Figure 3C-H

and Supplementary Figure S4). Also, as observed for IL-6, sMAdCAM levels were negatively
correlated with those of IL-15 (Figure 3I).
Finally, in a rudimentary analysis, we evaluated the possible prognostic value of our single
determinations of IL-15 together with IL-6 and sMAdCAM in predicting duration of hospitalization
independently. For this analysis, days of hospitalization post sampling, including those from
individuals with undetectable values for these markers (considered as 0) were plotted as shown in
Figure 3J-L. Proportional hazards analysis revealed significantly longer hospitalization for individuals
having IL-15 and IL-6 values, but not sMAdCAM values, in the upper 50 percent of our data sets.
This value was above >4.15 pg/ml of IL-15 and >14.29 pg/ml for IL-6.
Discussion:
In this study we describe cellular immune signatures characterizing mild (asymptomatic as well as
symptomatic) and hypoxemic (moderate and severe) COVID-19 disease. We further elucidate the
role of sMAdCAM, an important mucosal and lymphocyte migration marker and IL-15, a cytokine
regulating leukocyte activation and homeostasis, in the observed cellular immune signatures.
Our results clearly illustrate, as has been well described (13–16), leukopenic profiles only in
hypoxemic COVID-19 affected individuals. Further, in-depth analysis of T cell subsets revealed
distinct depletion profiles in operation within CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments. While the CD4+
T cell compartment did not show any preferential depletion across naïve and memory subsets, we
report here an asymmetric depletion profile in hypoxemic COVID-19 infection characterized by
drastic depletion of naïve CD8+ T cells with relative sparing of the CD8+ effector memory T cell
subset. These results extend the limited data available for T cell subsets in a stratified manner to
include distinct stages of COVID-19 pathogenesis (10, 17). The CD4+ T regulatory cell subset
represents a critical part of the response to viral infections (18, 19) that may play both protective as
well as exacerbatory roles in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our analysis revealed an incremental

decrease in absolute count of this subset from moderate to severe pathogenesis compared to
healthy controls. However, both stages of hypoxemic infection showed a relative preservation of
this subset evidenced through elevated frequencies compared to healthy controls. As has been
reported very recently this elevated frequency may represent suppressive (protective) as well as
inflammatory roles played by these cells, markedly higher, in severe disease (20). Our study also
evaluated the non-lymphocyte compartment in terms of monocytes and their profiles in mild and
hypoxemic COVID-19 disease. This compartment has been known to modulate inflammatory
responses to a variety of viral infections (21, 22). Interestingly, as opposed to the T cell
compartment and when compared with healthy seronegative individuals, a pan-disease signature
was delineated within monocytes comprising of elevated frequencies of intermediate monocytes.
Also, concomitant decrease in frequency of non-classical monocytes was observed in mild infection
irrespective of symptoms.
In an effort to understand factors influencing the observed cellular depletion and dysfunction in
our cohort we evaluated plasma markers that could influence inflammation, mucosal leukocyte
migration and homeostasis. Extending and strengthening our previous results on the converse
relationship between sMAdCAM and IL-6 observed in non-hypoxemic COVID-19 progression (12),
we report a similar and inversely correlated relationship between sMAdCAM and IL-6 levels across
mild and hypoxemic stages of COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, for the first time, we show that this
converse relationship extends to opposing correlations with observed cellular immune signatures
defining COVID-19 pathogenesis. Notably, elevated circulating LPS (a marker for gut inflammation),
in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, has only been reported for severe and ICU patients (9). In
our study we also observed increased plasma LPS levels in hypoxemic individuals compared to
seronegative controls as opposed to our previous work with a cohort of mild COVID-19 (12).
Importantly, there was no correlation between circulating LPS levels and either sMAdCAM or IL-6

levels. These results suggest that the altered trajectory of sMAdCAM levels is less related to gut
persistence mediated inflammation and more to altered mucosal leukocyte migration. Taken
together, our results show that IL-6 and sMAdCAM may contribute towards disparate aspects of
disease progression where circulating levels of the former are more closely related to inflammatory
sequalae and development of anti-viral B cell responses (class switching IL-6 reference) and those
of the latter with restoration of mucosal homeostasis of leukocytes. Indeed, we have recently
highlighted a role for the modulation of sMAdCAM and expression of its receptor integrin alpha-4
beta-7 present on monocytes, lymphocytes in the context of HIV pathogenesis (23).
While most immune markers of pathogenesis in COVID-19 have been reported to be associated
with mild, moderate and severe disease, a marker that clearly discriminates between symptomatic
and asymptomatic pathogenesis remains elusive. Our study is the first to demonstrate the
presence of plasma IL-15 as such a marker where detection of this cytokine is clearly segregated
based on the symptomatic status of patients with incrementally higher levels detected in mild
symptomatic to hypoxemic individuals. In fact, of the 2 (out of 11) mild asymptomatic individuals
that had detectable levels of this cytokine, one was found retrospectively to have progressed to a
hypoxemic stage. Also, negative correlation of plasma IL-15 levels with lymphopenic profiles (T, B,
NK) are indicative of its homeostatic restorative production (24–26) in the face of systemic
depletion of these subsets. Circulating IL-15 levels have been implicated as a contributory factor to
hospitalization time, disease severity and mortality in some settings (27, 28). Indeed, a preliminary
analysis in our cohort, with respect to days of hospitalization supported this finding. Our study
further demonstrates the utility of using it as an early biomarker predicting progression to
symptomatic and severe disease.

Conclusion:
In summation, our results delineate a role for inflammatory, homeostatic and migratory immune
mediators in COVID-19 associated lymphopenia, of which, plasma IL-15 detection may be an early
prognostic marker.

Methods
Study population, setting, and data collection: Sixteen seronegative controls and a total of 125 inpatients individuals were recruited, following informed consent, for the study from the COVID Care
Centres associated with BYL Nair hospital and T N medical college, Municipal Corporation of
Greater Mumbai (MCGM), Mumbai following approval of institutional ethics committees. We
obtained demographic data, clinical history at presentation, and laboratory results during
admission.
Blood samples for the study were handled in accordance with ICMR guidelines for biosafety. 1-3ml
of whole blood was collected in EDTA vacutainers. Aliquots of whole blood were processed for
absolute cell count and immunophenotyping as described below. Plasma was separated by
centrifugation at 400 g for 10 minutes. IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected
in fresh plasma samples using Rapid test from Voxpress (Voxtur Bio LTD, India) and
Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) directed against SARS -CoV-2 anti-NC IgG. Remaining
plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at -800 C until batch analysis of cytokines, LPS
(Lipopolysaccharide) and Soluble MAdCAM (sMAdCAM).
Assay for absolute count of T cells, B cells and NK cells
BD multitest 6 colour TBNK reagent and BD TrucountTM tubes were used to enumerate absolute
count of T cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, and Natural killer (NK) cells using 50 μl of fresh
EDTA stabilised blood following stain/lyse/no-wash protocol. Data acquisition was performed on
BD FACS Aria Fusion (SORP) Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) where 5000 events gated on beads
count were acquired. Data analysis was carried out using FlowJo software (BD biosciences)

Immunophenotyping
For phenotypic characterization, immunostaining of 200 μl of fresh peripheral whole blood with
following fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies, anti-CD3 (Clone:SK7), anti-CD4 (Clone: RPAT4), anti-CD8 (Clone: SK1), anti-CD25 (Clone: M-A251), anti-CD127 (Clone: HIL-7R-M21), anti-CCR7
(Clone: 150503), anti-CD45RA (Clone: HI100), anti-CD14 (Clone: M5E2 ) and anti-16 (Clone: 3G8)
was performed using stain/lyse/wash protocol as described earlier (11). Data acquisition was
performed on BD FACS Aria Fusion (SORP) flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) where at least 100,000
events in lymphocyte scatter gate were acquired. Data analysis was carried out using FlowJo
software.
Cytometric Bead Array
Flow based Cytometric bead array (Human Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine kit, BD Biosciences) was used to
quantify cytokine levels in plasma of study participants as per manufacturers’ protocol.
ELISA
Plasma IL-15, sMAdCAM-1 and LPS levels were quantified using Human IL-15 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D
Systems), Human MAdCAM-1 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems) and Human Lipopolysaccharides
ELISA kit (MyBioSource) respectively, following manufacturers’ recommendations. The values
below the level of detection were assigned as zero.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 8 using non parametric tests. Statistical
significance of differences between groups were assessed using Mann-Whitney U-test. Spearman's
rank-order correlation was used to analyse the association between participant attributes that had
detectable values in our assays. Kaplan–Meier curves were compared using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox)
test. Statistical significance was accepted at p<0.05.
