Key Points
Question: Was there difference in mortality rates between COVID-19 patients
managed by a mixed team (including non-specialists who had short intensive training
and operated to a strict protocol) and those managed by a specialist team of health
care workers (HCWs)?

Findings: In-hospital mortality rate among patients managed by specialist team (130
HCWs, 159 patients) and mixed team (131 HCWs, 110 patients) was 12.6% (20/159)
and 12.7% (14/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95% CI -8.2% to 7.9%, p=.97).

Meaning: With shortage of specialist HCWs, training and reployment of
non-specialists is an effective option in the management of COVID-19 patients.

Abstract
Importance: In the COVID-19 pandemic many countries encounter problems arising
from shortage of specialists. Short intensive training and reployment of
non-specialists is an option but the effectiveness is unknown.
Objective: To investigate whether there was difference in in-hospital mortality rates
between COVID-19 patients managed by a mixed team (including non-specialists
who had short intensive training and operated to a strict protocol) and those managed
by a specialist team of health care workers.
Design: Cohort study, from January 26, 2020 to April 7, 2020, follow up to April 7,
2020.
Setting: Multicenter - Wuhan Hankou Hospital and Wuhan Xiehe Hospital, Wuhan,
China.
Participants: 261 HCWs deployed to Wuhan from Guangdong emergency rescue
team and the 269 COVID-19 patients they treated.
Exposure: Among 261 health care workers, 130 were in the specialist team and
included 33 physicians, 32 of whom (97.0%) of whom were from relevant specialties.
Each physician was in charge of 25-27 beds, with a 6-hour shift time. The mixed team
included 131 health care workers, with 7 of the 28 physicians (25.0%) from relevant
specialties. Each physician managed 12-13 beds, with a 4-hour shift time.
Non-specialists received short-term intensive training and then followed strict
management protocols. Specialists practiced as normal.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcome was in-hospital mortality of

COVID-19 patients. Another outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health
care workers.
Results: A total of 269 patients were included (144 male). In-hospital mortality rate
of patients treated by the specialist teams and the mixed teams was 12.6% (20/159)
and 12.7% (14/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95% CI -8.2% to 7.9%, p=.97).
None of the health care workers were infected.
Conclusions and Relevance: Training and reployment of non-specialists is an
effective solution for the shortage of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed medical systems worldwide. Health
care workers (HCWs) from relevant specialties (eg critical care medicine and
pulmonary medicine) are particularly badly affected,1 while those from many other
departments experienced sharp declines in clinical activities2,3.
China was the first to face this challenge. In the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic,
emergency rescue medical teams outside the epicenter of Wuhan were composed of
specialists. With the shortfall in numbers, HCWs from specialties normally not
directly involved in management of a condition like COVID-19 were recruited to join
the rescue teams as an emergency measure. Here we describe the experience of
short-term training and redeployment of a team of non-specialist HCWs sent to
Wuhan from Guangzhou in January/February 2020 and the effectiveness of this
initiative.

Methods
Participants
This study retrospectively collected information on all HCWs of two medical teams
during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. One was a specialist team of the first batch
of Guangdong emergency rescue team, with physicians all from COVID-19 relevant
specialties, including the department of critical care medicine, pulmonary disease,
emergency medicine and infectious disease. The other was the mixed team of the third
batch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, with both specialists

and non-specialists. For these HCWs, we collected information on age, gender,
department, seniority, working hours and number of beds managed.
We also collected information from consecutive COVID-19 patients treated by the
two teams. The inclusion criteria were: a) clinical or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
patients4; b) admitted during the period the medical teams were deployed. We
collected basic characteristics including age, gender, co-morbidities, laboratory tests
and mortality.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of
Sun Yat-sen University, Wuhan Xiehe Hospital and Wuhan Hankou Hospital. The
informed consent was waived.

Short-term intensive training program
HCWs from the specialist team were trained and assessed on-site for the usage of
personal protection equipment (PPE) and infection control, especially during
aerosol-generating procedures. Key aspects of the training, including use of PPE and
ventilator, were incorporated into online videos for repeated learning (available at
http://en.gzsums.net/yyxw/info_37_itemid_1235.html).
Non-specialists received a hierarchical training course including two modules: a)
diagnosis procedure of COVID-19 and personal protection; b) advanced life support
technology (eg. ventilator and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)). The
videos were also made available to the mixed team. Detailed training arrangements
were listed in Table 1.

Each HCW of both teams was assessed by two senior specialists at the end of
training and before deployment. Specialists were required to master all the contents of
the two modules. Non-specialists were required to master the first module and high
flow nasal cannula, and to be able to recognize indications for mechanical ventilator
and ECMO.

Medical management protocols
The specialist team was based in Wuhan Hankou Hospital and was responsible for
one of the COVID-19 departments, which included 81 beds in three groups with
25-27 beds in each group. A total of 130 HCWs were in the specialist team from
January 26 to March 19. There were 33 physicians, 32 (97.0%) of whom were from
relevant specialties, and the remaining one isa cardiologist from the department of
cardiology, with previous working experience in intensive care. Three specialists were
in charge per shift. Formulation of treatment plan was led by one of the three senior
specialists deployed. The mixed team operated in Wuhan Xiehe Hospital and was
responsible for one department that included 50 beds in two groups with 25 beds in
each group. There were 4 HCWs in each shift, with at least one specialist. The mixed
team worked in Wuhan from February 8 to April 7 with a total of 131 HCWs. There
were 28 physicians, and only 7 (25.0%) were from relevant specialties. The HCWs
worked in pairs and managed one group of patients together. Formulation of treatment
plan was led by two specialists, one of whom was among the senior specialists
deployed. Should there be unexpected worsening of conditions or the need for

ventilation or ECMO, specialists had to be consulted.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher exact test, and
continuous variables were compared using independent sample t test. Primary
outcome was in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Another outcome was rate
of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers. We used SAS version 9.4 for data
analysis. A two-sided p-value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
A total of 269 patients were included, of which 159 were treated by the specialist
team and 110 were treated by the mixed team. The clinical characteristics of the two
groups of patients were comparable at baseline (Table 2), except that in the mixed
group more patients had hypertension (50.9% vs. 38.4%, p=.04) and diabetes (32.7%
vs. 20.8%, p=.03), and there were also more patients with critical condition.
In-hospital mortality rate of patients treated by the specialist teams and the mixed
teams was 12.6% (20/159) and 12.7% (14/110) respectively (Difference = -0.1%, 95%
CI -8.2% to 7.9%), p=.97).
None of the HCWs were infected in either team.5

Discussion
We found that with short-term intensive training and a strict management protocol,

in-hospital mortality rate among patients managed by the mixed team comprising
physicians from specialties not directly related to COVID-19 was similar to that of the
specialist team.
HCWs from COVID-19 relevant specialties are facing enormous physical and
mental stress6 under the pandemic. Various policies were proposed to reploy available
medical workforce 3,7,8, yet we could not identify any practical implementation plan in
the literature. Our results suggest that brief but systematic training of non-specialists
and medical management protocol for non-specialists working with a specialist could
result in outcomes comparable to those of specialists. No HCW was infected and this
was discussed in a previous report. 5.
Hierarchical training program according to the role and specialties of
non-specialists is crucial. It is unrealistic to require non-specialists to master all
complicated knowledge in a short time. One example of priority of learning objectives
in pre-deployment training concerns ventilation and ECMO. For non-specialists the
key issue is to recognize worsening of conditions and the need for ventilation or
ECMO but to master details of the operation of ventilator and ECMO requires much
more experience and professional knowledge. As only 2-3% of patients required
ECMO use,9,10 the protocol required the non-specialists to consult their specialist
colleagues if they came across possible indications.
As this study was not randomized, and the two medical teams did not commence
their stays in Wuhan at the same time, the patients managed by the two team may
have dissimilar conditions on admission. However, comparisons on some known

important variables did not show major differences. Indeed there was a higher
proportion of critical patients managed by the mixed team.
We conclude that training and reployment of non-specialists is an effective option
in the management of COVID-19 patients in systems facing acute shortage of
specialists.
