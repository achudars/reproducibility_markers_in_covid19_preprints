Abstract

24

COVID-19 is challenging healthcare preparedness, world economies, and livelihoods. The infection and

25

death rates associated with this pandemic are strikingly variable in different countries. To elucidate this

26

discrepancy, we analyzed 2431 early spread SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID. We estimated

27

continental-wise admixture proportions, assessed haplotype block estimation, and tested for the presence

28

or absence of strains recombination. Herein, we identified 1010 unique missense mutations and seven

29

different SARS-CoV-2 clusters. In samples from Asia, a small haplotype block was identified; whereas,

30

samples from Europe and North America harbored large and different haplotype blocks with

31

nonsynonymous variants. Variant frequency and linkage disequilibrium varied among continents,

32

especially in North America. Recombination between different strains was only observed in North

33

American and European sequences. Additionally, we structurally modeled the two most common mutations

34

D614G and P314L which suggested that these linked mutations may enhance viral entry and stability.

35

Overall, we propose that COVID-19 virulence may be more severe in Europe and North America due to

36

coinfection with different SARS-CoV-2 strains leading to genomic recombination which might be

37

challenging for current treatment regimens and vaccine development. Furthermore, our study provides a

38

possible explanation for the more severe second wave of COVID-19 that many countries are currently

39

experiencing presented as higher rates of infection and death.

Introduction

41

The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks have grievously

42

impacted the world by threatening lives and impeding human activity in a short period. Understanding the

43

factors that govern the severity of a pandemic is of paramount importance to design better surveillance

44

systems and control policies [1]. In the case of COVID-19, three variables play a critical role in its spread

45

and severity in a country: the nature of the pathogen, genetic diversity of the host population, and

46

environmental factors such as public awareness and health measures provided by governments [2].

47

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein plays an integral role in the viral transmission virulence [3]. The S

48

protein contains two functional subunits S1 and S2 cleaved by FURIN protease at the host cell [4]. The S1

49

subunit contains the receptor binding domain and facilitates interactions with the host cell surface receptor,

50

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [5,6]. The S2 subunit, activated by the host Transmembrane

51

Serine Protease 2, harbors necessary elements for membrane fusion [7]. S protein mutations may induce

52

conformational changes leading to increased pathogenicity [8]. We were pioneers to report the perspective

53

role of S protein D614G (23403A>G) variant located at the S1-S2 proximal junction. The D614G mutation

54

generates conformational changes in the protein structure which renders the FURIN cleavage site (664-

55

RRAR-667) flexible and thus enhances viral entry [9]. Currently, the D614G mutation has become the

56

focus of several recent studies for the use in prospective drug targeting strategies [10]. Furthermore, studies

57

on understanding the genetic diversity and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 are emerging [11] . Admixture

58

analyses have been conducted to understand the evolution of Beta-coronaviruses and in particular the

59

diversification of SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Haplotype analysis have also indicated that frequencies of certain

60

haplotypes correlate with virus pathogenicity [13].

61

Here we extended our study by analyzing the population genetics aspects within genome sequences of

62

SARS-CoV-2 to understand the contiguous spread of SARS-CoV-2, its rapid evolution, and the differential

63

severity of COVID-19 among different continents. We analyzed 2341 viral sequences deposited in GISAID

64

including those sequenced in our lab from patients in Kuwait. We found evidence of coinfection between

65

different viral strains in Europe and in North America but not in the other continents. We also modelled

66

major mutations and their possible effect on the stability of the encoded protein and hence on SARS-CoV-

67

2 virulence.

68

Methods

69

Retrieval of complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

70

2431 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from infected individuals were retrieved from the GISAID

71

database (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) [14] (accessed on April 3rd, 2020) and were used

72

for all analyses.

73

Alignment and annotation of amino acid sequence variation

74

Multiple sequence alignment was performed using MAFFT v7.407 [15] (retree: 5 , maxiter: 1000).

75

Alignments’ gaps were trimmed using TrimAL (automated1) [16]. SeqKit [17] was used to concatenate

76

chopped-off missing sequences using NC045512.2 as a reference. SNP-sites [18] and Annovar [19] were

77

used to extract and annotate single nucleotide variants (SNV).

78

Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks analysis

79

PLINK2 [20] was used to extract sequence variants with minor allele frequencies (MAF) ≥ 0.5%, to

80

estimate inter-chromosomal Linkage disequilibrium (LD), squared correlation coefficient (r2), and

81

haplotype blocks. We used Haploview [21] to visualize the haplotype blocks.

82

To detect recombination within datasets, we tested for pairwise homoplasy index using PhiPack software

83

[22]. Admixture 1.3.0 software [23] was used to identify genetic substructure of variants’ continental

84

transmission as follows: variants with MAF ≥ 0.5%, variants in LD (R2>0.5), haplotype blocks, variants

85

not in LD, nonsynonymous, and synonymous variants. All analyses were iterated for K=10 and cross

86

validation errors were examined to infer an optimal K cluster. Replicate runs were further processed using

Protein Structural Analysis

90

The crystal structures of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, PDB ID: 6M71) [25] and the

91

S protein (PDB ID:6VSB) [26] were used as model proteins for the structural analysis. The missing aa,

92

invisible by Cryo-EM structure of the S-protein, were modeled-in by using SWISS-Model [27]. DynaMut

93

web server [28] was used to predict the effect of the mutations on the proteins stability and flexibility.

94

PyMol (Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.0, Schrodinger, LLC) was used to generate structural

95

images.

Results

97

Detection and classification of mutations from global SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

98

We analyzed 2431 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from six continental groups. In

99

comparison to the Wuhan reference sequence (NC045512.2), 2352 sequences showed substantial genetic

100

differences. We identified 1010 unique missense amino acid (aa) mutations using our variant calling

101

pipeline. 613 variants were nonsynonymous, 387 variants were synonymous, 3 variants were stop-gain, and

102

1 variant was a 5’-utr variant. We found only 72 variants at MAF ≥ 0.5% which were for admixture and

103

haplotype block analysis. Fig 1 shows the distribution of synonymous and nonsynonymous variants in each

104

gene in SARS-CoV-2 genome with varying MAF thresholds. The genes with the highest percentage of

105

nonsynonymous variants with MAF ≥ 0.05 are ORF3a, M, and ORF8 while the genes with the highest

106

percentage of synonymous variants with MAF ≥ 0.05 are ORF6 and ORF10.

107

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 genetic clusters in different continents

108

We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of 2352 SARS-CoV-2 sequences as indicated in Fig

109

2. The PCA analysis gave three distinct clusters of samples based on their continent of origin. All three

110

clusters diverge from a single point (Fig 2, red circle). The North American cluster showed the least viral

111

genetic variances; unlike, samples from Asia and Oceania which harbored the most genetic diversity.

112

Whereas the European cluster is well defined with few interspersed Asian samples which is an indication

113

of its origin. This clustering in Europe and North America is probably associated with a founder effect

114

where a single mutation was introduced and subsequently transmitted. This suggestion is corroborated by

115

the fact that the collection date of the founder strain is prior to that observed in the European and the North

116

American clusters (S1 Fig).

117

Then, in order to estimate the ancestral allele frequencies and admixture proportions for each SARS-CoV-

118

2 sample, admixture analysis was implemented. We used cross validation (CV) procedure to find best (i.e.,

119

minimal error) K for a range of iterations in RAW (comprised 1010 SNVs). S2 Fig presents the trend of

120

CV error in RAW (A) and variants filtered for MAF≥0.5% (B). We observed a gradual reduction in CV

121

error for iterations up to K=7 and subsequently, a pattern of an increase-decrease was observed in

122

subsequent iterations; however, the least error was seen at K=17. Further, we verified this CV trend in a

123

subset of variants filtered for MAF ≥0.5% (comprised of 72 SNVs). Interestingly, we again observed a

124

gradual reduction of CV error up to K=7 (with best fit at 7) and subsequently, a trend of increasing CV

125

error.

126

We created subsets of strong LD, weak LD, Haplotype block, nonsynonymous, and synonymous variants

127

from 72 variants at K=7 across the continents. We separately performed admixture analysis on these

128

subsets. The analysis of the detected seven datasets revealed interesting mosaic patterns (Fig 3 A and B).

129

Samples from Asia formed largely two clusters (C1-dominant, and C6); whereas, the samples from Europe

130

dataset distributed into six different clusters (C1, C2-dominant, C3, C5, C6 and C7); and the North

131

American samples formed four clusters (C1, C2, C4-dominant and C7). Similarly, African and Oceanian

132

datasets formed two clusters each (C2, C3; with dominant C2 and C3, C5; with dominant C3 respectively)

133

and South American dataset is mostly formed by five clusters (C1, C2, C3, C5 and C6).

134

In the context of LD (Fig 3 C and D), the strong LD block is mostly observed in two clusters (C1 and C6)

135

and the weak LD block is observed in three clusters (C1, C3, and C7) in Asia. In Europe, the strong LD

136

block is observed in 4 clusters (C1, C2, C3, and C5) and the weak LD block is observed in five clusters

137

(C1,C2,C3,C4, and C5; predominantly from C3 and C5). Interestingly, four clusters are common between

138

the strong and weak LD blocks, suggesting that a makeup of four strains that dominate in Europe have

139

significant proportion of strong and weak LD signatures in them. Likewise, in North America, both strong

140

and weak LD are observed among three clusters (C1, C2, and C4) and (C1, C3, and C4) respectively.

141

Further in Africa, Oceania and South America, strong LD is observed among (C2), (C1) and (C1 and C2)

142

respectively; weak LD is observed in (C3 and C4), (C1, C2, C3, and C5), (C3 and C5) respectively.

143

Interestingly, proportions of a Haplotype block (Fig 3 E) identified using whole data, mostly followed

144

pattern of strong LD of respective continents, however admixed with a weak LD strain of respective

145

continents.

146

Most importantly variation in proportions of strains carrying nonsynonymous and synonymous signatures

147

are also very evident as shown in Fig 3 F and G. Proportions of two nonsynonymous clusters (C1 and C5;

148

both also have admixed with each other) and two synonymous clusters are dominated in Asia. Four clusters

149

of nonsynonymous (C2, C4, C5, and C6) and five clusters of synonymous are dominating in Europe, while

150

in North America, three nonsynonymous (C1, C3, C6) and two synonymous (C1, C3) clusters are in higher

151

proportions. Similarly; C4 and C6, C5, and C2 nonsynonymous clusters along with C1and C6, C2, and C5

152

synonymous clusters are in high proportion in Africa, Oceania, and South America respectively.

153

Evidence of co-infection in the sequences from continental datasets

154

Here, we tested for the presence or absence of recombination among continental datasets using PhiPack

155

software which effectively differentiates between presence or absence of recombination using three

156

different tests “Pairwise Homoplasy Index (Phi)” (Bruen et al. 2006), “Neighbor Similarity Score (NSS)”

157

(Jakobsen and Easteal, 1996) and “Maximum χ2 (MaxChi)” [29].

158

The results of these tests on the combined dataset suggested the possibility of co-infection at a global level.

159

Among continental datasets, only European (NSS test, P-value = 0.001) and North American [NSS and Phi

160

(normal), P-value = 0.007 and 0.042, respectively] sequences have shown evidence for the presence of

Estimation of haplotype blocks in continental samples

171

We carried out this analysis in two ways; first by comparing haplotype blocks obtained from combined

172

dataset of variants with MAF ≥0.5% with each continental dataset. We did this analysis because continental

173

datasets of Africa (n=25), Oceania (n=69), and South America (n=24) were very small to infer high

174

confident LD blocks from respective datasets alone. Hence, we first compared LD blocks obtained from

175

the combined dataset and then observed LD among the same variants in each continental dataset. The

176

second way of analysis was by directly estimating haplotype blocks in each continental dataset with large

177

sample size such as Asia, Europe, and North America.

178

From the first analysis, we observed that LD block, obtained from the combined dataset, varies among

179

continental datasets. S3 Fig illustrates the extent of LD variation in haplotype block of combined dataset in

180

each continental dataset. Examination of variant allele frequency at haplotype block suggested a clear

181

variation in allele frequency between continental datasets. Table 2 shows MAF of 18 variants involved in

182

haplotype block of combined dataset in each continental dataset. These differences called for the second

183

approach of estimating haplotype blocks and the extent of LD between variants directly from each

184

continental dataset having large sample size. Surprisingly, we observed different sets of variants in

185

haplotype blocks, different length of haplotype blocks, and differences in nonsynonymous composition in

186

haplotype blocks among the three continents datasets (Fig 4). Table 3 describes characteristics of the

187

haplotype blocks observed in the datasets from Asia, Europe, and North America.

Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations

196

D614G mutation. Wrapp et al. recently solved the cryo-EM structure of the S protein with 3.5 Å resolution

197

[26] (Fig 5 A). The S protein has many flexible loop regions that were not visible in the structure, including

198

the RRAR cleavage site. Therefore, we modeled-in the cleavage site and the undetected flexible regions

199

using the cryo-EM structure PDB ID: 6M71 as a scaffold [27]. Fig 5 B shows the overlay of the S protein

200

from PDB ID:6VSB with the modelled S protein, with an RMSD of 0.25 Å. As shown in the overlay figure,

201

there are more loops present in the modelled structure that were not detected by Cryo-EM. The RRAR

202

cleavage site (Fig 5 C) shows a high surface accessible region, where the viral protein can attach to the host

203

protein. As such, any mutations on the S protein especially close to RRAR site might alter its activity.

204

D614G is a mutation believed to increase SARS-CoV-2 virulence [9]. One possibility is that the change

205

from a negatively charged aspartate to a non-polar glycine may modify the structure and therefore the

206

function of the protein. Charged amino acids form ionic and hydrogen bonds (H-bond) through their side

207

chains and stabilize proteins [30]. The targeted aspartate is present in the loop region, therefore a mutation

208

to a glycine would cause unfolding of the loop and possibly render it more flexible making the FURIN

209

cleavage site more accessible.

210

D614 is in close vicinity to T859 of the adjacent monomer’s S2 (Chain B) where they can form a H-bond

211

(Fig 6) through both sidechains. In addition, backbone H-bonds can be formed with A646 of the same

212

chain. It was documented that S2 domains alter their structure after FURIN site cleavage [31]. Therefore,

213

the mutation of D614 to G might weaken the stability of S2 and make cell entry more aggressive. It is

214

probably the loss of the H-bond between D614 (S1/Chain A) and T859 (S2/Chain B) that stops the hinging

215

of the S2 domain making it more flexible in the transition state when interacting with the host cell receptor.

216

Another possibility would be that the mutation to G and the loss of the H-bond to the adjacent chain made

217

the protein more flexible. A thermodynamic analysis showed that D614G mutation resulted in slightly

218

destabilizing the protein with a ΔΔG: -0.086 kcal/mol and in increasing in vibrational entropy ΔΔSVib 0.137

219

kcal.mol-1.K-1 as seen in Fig 7 A where the red parts indicate more flexibility. Since this mutation will occur

220

on the trimeric structure of the S-protein, all the three domains will be more flexible. Such flexibility will

221

render the FURIN cleavage site more accessible which is concomitant with the virulence of the D614G

222

mutation. Furthermore, the flexibility observed in the ribosomal binding domain region (Fig 7) may

223

facilitate the binding of ACE2 to the S protein [26].

224

P314L mutation. ORF1a and ORF1b produce a set of non-structural proteins (nsp) which assemble to

225

facilitate viral replication and transcription (nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12) [32]. The nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)

226

entry site and the nascent RNA strand exit paths has positively charged aa, is solvent accessible, and is

227

conserved in SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 8). P314L mutation is positioned on the interface domain of the RdRp (or

228

nsp12) between A250-R365 residues. Previous studies have shown that the interface domain has functional

229

significance in the RdRp of Flavivirus. In addition, when polar or charged residue mutations were

230

introduced into these sites, viral replication levels were significantly affected [33]. Thus, mutations on

231

nsp12 interface residues may affect the polymerase activity and RNA replication of SARS-CoV-2. Proline

232

is often found in very tight turns in protein structures and can also function to introduce kinks into α-helices.

233

In Fig 9, we investigated the proposed intermolecular bonds that P314 can make, where the backbone COO-

234

group of proline can form H-bonds with the backbone NH groups of T and S or the OH-group of S side

235

chain. Whereas the pyrrolidine forms hydrophobic interactions with the W268 and F275. The mutation to

236

leucine tightens the structure and reduces the flexibility with an increase in ΔΔG: 0.717 kcal/mol and a

237

decrease in vibrational entropy to ΔΔSVib ENCoM: -0.301 kcal.mol-1.K-1 (Fig 10). Furthermore, leucine

238

possesses a non-polar side chain, seldomly involving catalysis, which can play a role in substrate

239

recognition such as binding/recognition of hydrophobic ligands. L314 backbone COO- forms a H-bond

240

with the sidechain OH- group of S325, in addition to a hydrophobic interaction with W68 and L270. L270

241

is positioned on top of the flexible loop region, therefore forming a hydrophobic interaction, displacing any

242

possibility of water molecules entering the looped region thus making it more compact. The overall

243

improved stability of RdRp can make it more efficient in RNA replication and hence increasing SARS-

244

CoV-2 virulence.

Discussion

246

Our pairwise homoplasy index tests suggest that, among continental datasets, European and North

247

American sequences have shown evidence for the presence of recombination events (P-value = 0.001 and

248

0.007 respectively); while African, Oceanic, South American, and Asian datasets have shown no

249

recombination events till now. This again shows that the European and North American continents are at

250

higher risk of having super evolved viruses that can co-infect their hosts. Thus far, these recombination

251

effects might also lead to the deletion of big portions of RNA such as the one reported in a recent article,

252

where an 81-nucleotide deletion was detected in SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a [34]. Similar deletions might give rise to

253

attenuated viruses and aid vaccine design.

254

Depending on variance seen within the clustered samples, PCA analysis indicated that clustering in Europe

255

and North America is probably associated with a founder effect where a single mutation was introduced

256

and subsequently transmitted; 23403AG in Europe and 28144TC in North America. Admixture analysis

257

identified differing number of clusters of viral strains in different continents: Europe with six clusters, South

258

America with five, North America with four, and Africa and Asia with two each. Both strong and weak LD

259

blocks are seen among clusters of strains in every continent; the four dominant strains in Europe have

260

significant proportion of strong and weak LD signatures in them. Proportions of strains carrying missense

261

variants over nonsynonymous variants differ among continents – five clusters of missense variants are

262

dominant in Europe, three in North American while two clusters of missense variants are dominant in Asia,

263

Africa, and South America. In regard to recombination patterns, European and North American continents

264

showed evidence for the presence of recombination events among SARS-CoV-2 genomes which give

265

indication of continuing evolution among SARS-CoV-2 viral strains.

266

Admixture analysis has shown 7 different strains with differential segregation of alleles in SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

267

Upon constricting variants with strong LD, the proportional assignment did not change in Africa and Asia, whereas

268

it changed in Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. In fact, proportions in Europe (C2 & C3) and

269

North America (C2 & C4) increased excessively suggesting that strong LD sites are present in more than one strain

270

in each of these two continents. Presence of an un-admixed block pattern of strong LD between strains suggests that

271

LD sites are not broken by significant recombination seen in these two continents. This is either due to their physical

272

distance or natural selection. On the contrary, weak LD sites have shown clear admixture between strains. Strikingly,

273

each continent is dominated by different set of nonsynonymous clusters such as Africa by C4, Asia by C1, Europe

274

by C2, North America by C3, Oceania by C5, and South America by C2. This is also evident from the allele

275

frequency variation seen in each continent.

276

Further, continental-wise haplotype block estimation enabled us to identify variation of linked nonsynonymous and

277

synonymous sites in Asia, Europe, and North America. Although selection primarily acts on variation that undergo

278

amino acid change, many synonymous variants were observed in haplotype blocks. This suggests that these

279

synonymous sites hitch-hiked along with nonsynonymous variants due to their physical proximity. Another

280

observed interesting feature was the variation in the number of nonsynonymous sites between Asia, Europe, and

281

North America. Asian haplotype block carried three nonsynonymous variants, Europe haplotype block carried ten

282

nonsynonymous variants, and North American haplotype block carried seven nonsynonymous variants. This

283

suggests that the initial strain which originated and travelled from Asia had less functional sites whereas coinfection-

284

led recombination in Europe and North America enriched functional sites in strains.

285

Our preliminary structural analysis of the European strain main mutations, D614G located in the spike gene

286

and P314L located in the RdRp gene, showed that the first mutation will render the FURIN cleavage site

287

more accessible while the latter would increase protein stability. 73% of the European samples have both

288

mutations segregating together; while in Africa only 11% of the sequenced viral samples have them. This

289

is probably the reason behind the elevated mortality rates in Europe. This points out to the fact that the virus

290

has evolved at an alarming rate by introducing two mutations that increase its chances of survival. The

291

European strain harbors additional mutations, notably the hotspot mutations R203K and G204R that cluster

292

in a serine-rich linker region at the RdRp. It was suggested that these mutations might potentially enhance

293

RNA binding and replication and may alter the response to serine phosphorylation events [35], which might

294

further exacerbates SARS-CoV-2 virulence.

295

We understand that other confounding factors like SARS-CoV-2 testing, socioeconomical status, the

296

availability of proper medical services, and the burden of other diseases are important contributors to the

297

disparities seen in mortality rates around the world. It is imperative that more comprehensive studies should

298

be conducted as more patient data emerges from different parts of the world. We also realize that our

299

analysis focuses only on the early spread samples and that we have to keep analyzing the viral sequences

300

to determine if recombination is occurring between other strains and identify any new mutations specially

301

since the world is currently fighting the second wave of the virus. Our data highlight the urgent need to

302

correlate patients’ medical/infection history to the viral variants in order to predict in a more accurate and

303

personalized way how different viral strains are influencing this pandemic.
