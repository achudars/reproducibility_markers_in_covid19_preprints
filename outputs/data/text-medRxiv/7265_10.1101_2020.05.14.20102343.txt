Abstract

31

Background Since the spread of COVID-19 on a global scale, most of efforts at national and

32

international levels were directed to mitigate the spread of the disease and its physical harm , paying

33

less attention to the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on global mental health especially at early

34

stages of the pandemic.

35

Objectives This study aimed to assess and explore (i) The levels of psychological distress and its

36

correlates (ii) Motivation for distance learning (iii) Coping activities and pandemic related concerns,

37

among university students in Jordan in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic

38

Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. The

39

measure of psychological distress was obtained using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress

40

Scale,while other questions have explored our study’s second and third aims.

41

Results A total of 381 completed questionnaires were included in the analysis. Female participants

42

slightly predominated the sample (n=199, 52.2%). The respondents aged 18-38 years (mean 22.6 years,

43

SD: 3.16). Concerning distress severity, most of respondents were regarded as having severe

44

psychological distress (n=265, 69.5%). 209 students (54.9%) reported that they had no motivation for

45

distance learning. Ordinal logistic regression revealed a significant correlation between distress

46

severity and many predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as a protective factors

47

against higher levels of distress included older age (aOR=0.64, P=0.022; 95% CI: 0.44 - 0.94) , and

48

having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR=0.10, P=0.048 ; 95% CI: 0.01 - 0.96).In

49

contrary, being a current smoker (aOR=1.99, P=0.049 ; 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.39), and having no motivation

50

for distance learning (aOR=2.49, P=0.007; 95% CI: 1.29 - 4.80) acted as risk factors for having higher

51

levels of psychological distress among the students .The most common coping activity reported was

52

spending more time on social media platforms (n=269, 70.6%), and 209 students (54.9%) reported

53

distance learning was their most distressing concern.

54

Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures could impact the mental health of

55

individuals, including students. We recommend a nationwide psychological support program to be

56

incorporated into Jordan’s preparedness plan and response strategy in combating the COVID-19

57

pandemic.

INTRODUCTION

60

COVID-19 is a highly transmissible respiratory disease caused by a new type of human coronaviruses;

61

SARS-CoV-2 (Al-Tammemi, 2020). Since its discovery in late December 2019, the disease has spread

62

widely across many countries and territories on a global scale. As of September 20,2020 more than 30

63

million confirmed cases, and over nine hundred thousand confirmed deaths across 216 countries and

64

territories were attributed to the COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020).

65

Epidemics and outbreaks can pose profound impacts on physical health, mental health as well as the

66

global economy resulting in disruptions of humans’ daily life (Chakraborty and Maity, 2020). The

67

containment measures that were adopted by many countries worldwide in combating the COVID-19

68

such as quarantine, countries’ lockdown, travel restrictions, physical distancing, social isolation as well

69

as local restrictions on individuals’ mobility, can lead to a significant burden on mental health causing

70

emotional and behavioral changes (SAMHSA, 2014; Brooks et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Center for

71

the Study of Traumatic Stress, 2020; Holmes et al., 2020).

72

In addition, the psychological impacts of outbreaks are considered a threat not only on individuals with

73

pre-existing psychiatric illness but also on those who are free of any psychiatric condition (Ho et al.,

74

2020). The fear of an epidemic can afflict individuals irrespective of their gender, age, race, or

75

socioeconomic status. Anxiety, insomnia, anger, loneliness, fear, shame, helplessness, blame, guilt,

76

and stigma were all found to be present during infectious diseases’ outbreaks (Ho et al., 2020; Ornell

77

et al., 2020). Different psychiatric conditions, including depression, panic attacks, Post Traumatic

78

Stress Disorder, and even suicidality, were also reported to be associated with outbreaks, especially in

79

younger age groups (Ho et al., 2020).

80

In epidemics, certain groups in the society such as older people, children, health care workers, infected

81

patients, patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions and students are at a greater risk of suffering

82

from a significant degree of psychological pressure and stress compared to other individuals (Ho et al.,

83

2020). It is essential to gather information about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental

84

health of the general population and specific vulnerable groups, and this will help in developing

85

appropriate interventions that would mitigate such pandemic’s adverse effects (Holmes et al., 2020).

86

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the global efforts act on the biological and

87

physical aspects of the pandemic in order to limit its spread within the communities. However, much

less attention was paid to the mental health risks of the COVID-19 pandemic especially at early stages

89

of the pandemic.

90

Jordan is amongst the countries that have been struck by the COVID-19 pandemic , and in response to

91

that , many preventive and control strategies were enforced by the government to retard the viral spread

92

in the country. One of Jordan’s public health responses during early stages of the pandemic was

93

declaring the closure of all schools and higher academic institutions with shifting to online remote

94

learning since the middle of March 2020 (Al-Tammemi, 2020; Jordanian Ministry of Health, 2020;

95

Prime Ministry of Jordan, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic alongwith the disruptions that happened

96

in various sectors including the academic sector has forced the students to live in a new experience at

97

both academic and personal levels. Consequently and in light of limited literatures that assessed mental

98

health status of university students in Jordan, our present study aimed at (i) Exploring the level of

99

psychological distress and its correlates amongst university students during the COVID-19 pandemic

100

(ii) Evaluating the students’ motivation for distance learning and , (iii) Exploring coping activities and

101

major pandemic related concerns from students’ perspective.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

103

2.1

Study Design and Participants

104

A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020, using an online self-administered questionnaire

105

of closed-ended questions. The participants in our study were recruited through social media platforms

106

employing a convenience sampling strategy. The questionnaire was distributed across seven randomly

107

selected Facebook groups of university students in Jordan and academic groups on WhatsApp

108

messenger for a duration of one day. These social media groups were created by students as a tool for

109

general and academic communication within the students’ community and involved students who are

110

currently enrolled in different study programs and levels at various academic institutions in Jordan.

111

The students who were available and voluntarily willing to be involved in the study could open a link

112

to get an information letter about the study, eligibility criteria, and informed consent as a prerequisite

113

to proceed in participation.Considering the nature of the web-based Google form surveys , the students

114

were instructed to fill out the questionnaire with probity after fullfilling the eligibility criteria,

115

consenting on voluantry participation and filling it only once. We did not provide any form of

116

compensation to the participants upon their involevement in our study.

117

We decided to carry out this study using an internet-based survey due to the current pandemic crisis

118

and the national strict measures on the face to face communication coupled with the closure of all

119

academic institutions in Jordan at the time of data collection In addition, using the internet and social

120

media for the recruitment and sampling procedures in this study has shown to be an effective and time-

121

efficient method to reach inaccessible potential participants from different Jordanian regions by

122

eliminating any geographical boundaries. A recent systematic review of 109 published articles that

123

aimed at evaluating the use of social media such as Facebook for recruitment of research participants

124

in various psychological and medical studies came into evidence, which supported the effectiveness

125

and efficiency of this strategy (Thornton et al., 2016).

126

For a student to be able to participate in this study, all the following eligibility criteria were

127

implemented:

128

1- Age ≥ 18 years

129

2- Residing in Jordan during the pandemic crisis

130

3- Active enrollment in an undergraduate or postgraduate study at a Jordanian University.

Instruments and Measures

133

The online questionnaire was created using Google Forms provided by Google ™ and was constructed

134

in modern standard Arabic. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, with a total of 24 questions.

135

The first section comprised of seven questions about sociodemographic information including age,

136

gender, region of residence, study level, type of academic institution, marital status, and smoking status

137

alongwith two questions about any history of pre-existing psychiatric conditions and related

138

medication use.

139

The second section included an Arabic version of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale

140

(K10). This Arabic version was translated from the original English version by a team of linguistic

141

experts from multiple Arab countries (Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, and Tunisia) in addition to Arab experts

142

in Psychology in the United States. The Arabic version is provided by Harvard Medical School on the

143

webpage of the National Comorbidity Survey (National Comorbidity Survey, 2013).

144

The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) is an internationally validated tool for simple

145

and rapid assessment/screening of non-specific psychological distress in which 10 questions with 55

146

point Likert scale responses are present (Andrews and Slade, 2001; Kessler et al., 2002; Fassaert et al.,

147

2009; Easton et al., 2017). On a sample of Arabs, the Arabic version of the 10-item Kessler

148

Psychological Distress Scale (K10) has shown satisfactory psychometric properties with high internal

149

consistency and reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.88) (Easton et al., 2017).

150

The questions of the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) are:

151

Question 1 (Q1). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel tired out for no good reason?”

152

Question 2 (Q2). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel nervous?”

153

Question 3 (Q3). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel so nervous that nothing could

154

calm you down?”

155

Question 4 (Q4). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel hopeless?”

156

Question 5 (Q5). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel restless or fidgety?”

157

Question 6 (Q6). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel so restless you could not sit

158

still?”

159

Question 7 (Q7). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel depressed?”

160

Question 8 (Q8). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel that everything was an effort?”

161

Question 9 (Q9). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel so sad that nothing could

162

cheer you up?”

163

Question 10 (Q10). “During the last 30 days, about how often did you feel worthless?”

164

The response choices with their correspondence score weights are None of the time (1 point), A little

165

of the time (2 points), Some of the time (3 points), Most of the time (4 points), and All the of time (5

166

points). With having 10 questions and five weighted responses as previously described, the total

167

minimum and maximum scores for the Kessler distress scale (K10) are 10 and 50, respectively. As per

168

the scale’s guide, Q3 and Q6 were not asked in our study and were automatically scored as one point

169

if the preceding questions Q2 and Q5 were answered as None of the time.

170

The severity of psychological distress was then categorized into four groups as the following based on

171

the total K10 distress score for each participant: 10-19 = no psychological distress, 20-24 = mild

172

psychological distress, 25-29 = moderate psychological distress, and 30-50 = severe psychological

173

distress (Andrews and Slade, 2001).

174

The third section of the questionnaire included five questions about the following topics: one question

175

about coping activities during COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide curfew in Jordan.This question

176

included a list of 13 activities from which the students were able to choose all that applies to their

177

situation and to add any activity that was not listed among the choices using the option “others , please

178

specifiy”. Most of the listed acitivities were suggested by the authors and few others were adapted from

179

another resource (USCF, 2020).Amongst these activities were spending more time on social

180

networking platforms ,talking to friends, watching television, more engagement with family, listening

181

to music, practicing sports at home, studying and preparing for exams, increase smoking, reading

182

Books / novels, meditation, herbal drinks, practicing Yoga, talking to a psychological counselor and

183

others. Two questions about the use of medications to cope with COVID-19 related distress,in which

184

one of the questions was with yes/no response to know whether the student used a medicinal drug to

185

cope with pandemic distress or not and if yes, to report the frequency of usage, while the other question

186

included different classes of medications with examples on most common trade names in each class

187

and the students could add any medication that was not listed using the option “others , please

188

specifiy”. Additionally, one question about students’ motivation for online distance learning ,using a

189

single-answer item with responses as no motivation, low motivation, moderate motivation, and strong

190

motivation, and lastly, a question about major pandemic related concerns as perceived by the students.

191

This question was a single-answer question with five response choices including being infected by

192

COVID-19, online distance learning, the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic , curfew and

193

social isolation, and other concerns.

194

The questionnaire was piloted on 10 students who were approached by the first author to test the

195

phrasing, suitability, and understandability of the questions. The responses from these 10 students, as

196

well as incomplete questionnaires, were excluded from the analysis.

Data Management and Analysis

201

Completed questionnaires were extracted from Google Forms as an Excel sheet and were then

202

incorporated into STATA IC 16.1 (StataCorp LLC., Texas, USA). Descriptive analysis and summary

203

statistics were used in which numerical variables were described as mean and standard deviation, while

204

categorical variables were described as frequency and percentage. In addition, non-parametric tests

205

were used including Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test to compare the mean of total K10 distress scores

206

between males and females while Spearman’s rank correlation to test the relationship between age and

207

total K10 distress scores. Besides, ordinal logistic regression was employed to assess the correlation

208

between psychological distress severity (outcome variable with ordinal responses) and other

209

independent sociodemographic predictors. The confidence level was set at 95% and a P-value less than

210

0.05 was considered statistically significant.

211

2.4

212

The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was granted by

213

the Institutional Review Board at Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan. Besides, the questionnaire

214

ensured the privacy and confidentiality of participants by not asking any questions about names, phone

215

numbers, physical addresses, or emails; thus, all participants were anonymous. Also, an information

216

letter was incorporated into the first page of the questionnaire and included explicit information about

217

the researchers and their affiliations, the study description and objectives, eligibility criteria for

218

participation, voluntary participation and withdrawal, benefits and risks, privacy and confidentiality

219

aspects, data handling, as well as the contact details for any enquiry. Furthermore, at the end of the

220

information letter, electronic informed consent was requested from participants as a prerequisite to join

221

the survey voluntarily.

3.1

Respondents’ Characteristics

230

A total of 397 questionnaires were received, and 16 were excluded due to incompleteness. So, the

231

remaining 381 were included in our analysis. There was a slight predomination of female participants

232

(n=199, 52.2%) compared to male participants (n=182, 47.8%). The mean age was 22.6 years

233

(SD=3.16) and ranged between 18-38 years. The vast majority of participants were single (n=352 ,

234

92.4%) , undergraduates (n=323 ,84.8%) , studying at governmental/public universities or colleges

235

(n=209 , 54.9%) , living in the central region of Jordan (n=302 , 79.3%) , currently non-smokers (n=267

236

,70.1%) as well as with no history of pre-existing psychological or mental illness (n=366 , 96.1%).

237

More details about the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents are provided in Table 1.

Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) Results

240

The total K10 distress scores had a mean of 34.2 (SD=9.4). The mean K10 distress score was slightly

241

higher among women (mean=34.7, SD=8.56) compared to men (mean=33.7, SD=10.3); however,

242

Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test showed that this difference is statistically insignificant (P=0.566).

243

Concerning age, Spearman’s rank correlation test revealed a statistically significant inverse

244

relationship between age and total K10 distress score (Rho= -0.1645, P=0.001 ), which indicates that

245

younger age groups were more likely to have higher total K10 distress scores; thus, more distress.

246

(Figure 1).

247

Regarding psychological distress severity categorization and based on K10 scale’s categories described

248

earlier in study instrument, most of respondents were regarded as having severe psychological distress

249

(n=265, 69.5%), followed by moderate psychological distress (n=48, 12.6%), mild psychological

250

distress (n=41, 10.8%), and no psychological distress (n=27, 7.1%). Tables 2 and Figure 2 show more

251

descriptive results of the K10 distress scale by severity level and gender.

252

Ordinal logistic regression was employed to assess the correlation between distress severity (ordinal

253

outcome variable) and other sociodemographic predictors, however, considering our sample size

254

(n=381) and in order to achieve sufficient statistical power for the regression test, we have merged no

255

distress and mild distress in one ordinal category as well as moderate distress and severe distress

256

together in another ordinal category. Therefore , we had an ordinal outcome variable with two severity

levels/categories. After that, we tested each independent variable against the outcome variable .All

258

independent variables that had a P value less than 0.25 in univariable regression were included in the

259

final ordinal logistic regression model. The regression model revealed a significant correlation

260

between distress severity and some predictors. Among the predictors that were found to act as a

261

protective factor against higher levels of distress were older age (aOR=0.64, P=0.022; 95% CI: 0.44 –

262

0.94) , and having a strong motivation for distance learning (aOR=0.10, P=0.048 ; 95% CI: 0.01 -

263

0.96) .In contrary, being a current smoker (aOR=1.99, P=0.049 ; 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.39), and having no

264

motivation for distance learning (aOR=2.49, P=0.007; 95% CI: 1.29 - 4.80) acted as risk factors for

265

having higher levels of psychological distress among the students The detailed results of oridinal

logistic regression are presented in Table 3

3.3

The motivation for Distance Learning

269

Surprisingly, a significant proportion of the students have reported that they had no motivation at all

270

toward the online distance learning (n=209, 54.9%), , and as described earlier , students with no

271

motivation for distance learning were more likely to suffer from higher degrees of psychological

272

distress (aOR=2.49, P=0.007; 95% CI: 1.29 - 4.80).Table 4 and Figure 3 demonstrate more

273

descriptive details about the motivation for distance learning .

3.4

Coping Activities and Concerns during the COVID-19 Pandemic

The students have selected many coping activities that the they frequently practiced during the

277

nationwide curfew in Jordan. Interestingly, the responses with highest frequencies were spending more

278

time on social networking platforms like Facebook and Instagram (n=269, 70.6%), talking to friends

279

on mobile phones and internet (n=217, 57%), watching television and movies (n=210, 55.1%), more

280

engagement with family (n=202, 53%), and listening to music (n=162, 42.5%). More details about

281

these activities are provided in Table 5.

282

In addition, among the 381 respondents, 332 students (87.1%) reported no use of any medications

283

during the last 30 days for coping with the distress accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic and the

284

nationwide curfew, while 49 students (12.9%) reported the use of various types of medications at

285

different frequencies with occasionally (1-2 times in a month) as the most common frequency. Sedative

hypnotics (38%) reported being on the top of the used medications followed by others (28%), which

287

included over-the-counter medications like Paracetamol and other simple analgesics. More details are

288

demonstrated in Figures 4, 5, and Table 6.

289

Moreover, 209 students (54.9%) reported that online distance learning was the highest and most

290

serious issue of concern, followed by 75 students (19.7%) who reported curfew and social isolation as

291

their highest issue of concern. Unexpectedly, only 53 students (13.9%) reported being infected by

292

COVID-19 as their most serious concern. Figure 6 for more illustration.

DISCUSSION

295

In our study, the vast majority of the students (92.9%) suffered from different levels of psychological

296

distress ranging from mild to severe degrees during the COVID-19 pandemic.The psychological

297

wellbeing of university students in the midst of the current pandemic has been established and reported

298

in recently published litratures as well .A recent study which was conducted by Cao et al. (2020) in

299

China and aimed at exploring the psychological impact of COVID-19 on college students using the 7-

300

item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) has revealed that 24.9% of students suffered from

301

anxiety during this pandemic with a positive association of the level of anxiety with different economic

302

and academic stressors (Cao et al., 2020). Similar to Cao et al. (2020) study, our study found that there

303

was no significant difference in the total psychological distress scores between men and women. In

304

addition, Cao et al. found that social support was negatively associated with anxiety status among

305

students, and we have that as one of our most reported coping mechanisms, i.e., socialization through

306

social networking sites. Nevertheless, in our study, age was statistically and significantly associated

307

with distress severity; i.e the younger the age, the more likely to suffer from higher levels of

308

psychological distress. The difference in distress proportions between our study (92.9%) and Cao et al

309

study (24.9 %) could be attributed to the use of different scales, i.e. GAD-7 vs. K10 as well as the

310

sample size. In addition, we carried out the survey in a period close to final examinations, which might

311

have had an additional negative impact on the students’ psychological status.

312

Additionally, a recent study by Olimat et al (2020) (Olaimat et al., 2020) was conducted to assess

313

attitudes, anxiety, as well as behavioral practices among university students in Jordan amidst the

314

COVID-19 pandemic using an online survey developed by the authors to serve their study objectives .

315

The study has found that 69.2 % of participants reported being anxious as a result of fear of infection

by COVID-19 and resultant disruptions in their lives.Among the predicitve factors that affected the

317

students’ anxiety levels were age , gender and academic discipline of their study programs.Older

318

students and female students were found to have more anxiety due to the fear of infection . However,

319

in our present study the mean total K10 distress score was higher among women compared to men ,but

320

this difference in means was statistically not significant . In contrary , older age was amongst the

321

protective factors against higher levels of psychological distress in our present study.

322

Moreover , a cross sectional study was conducted in Turkey which aimed at assessing anxiety status

323

of university students using an online survey.The measure of anxiety levels were obtained using the

324

Turkish version of abbreviated Beck Anxiety Inventory.The study has found that 44 % of students

325

reported a moderate level of worrisome and fear of catching COVID-19 , while 80% of students

326

reported a ‘severe level’ of scare and worries about thier close relatives’ health .The authors expected

327

that the high levels of anxiety among the students in their study could be attributed to shifting to online

328

learning alongwith other pandemic control measures such as social isolation and financial constraints

329

(Akdeniz et al., 2020). Similarly, the aforementioned worries were also reported by the students in our

330

study as part of their major concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

331

Furthermore, Stress and anxiety were assessed in France among university students during the current

332

pandemic.University students were asked to complete the World Mental Health International College

333

Student survey which was distributed as an online survey.Among the 291 participants in the study, the

334

majority of them experienced significant proportions of psychological distress of which 60.2% of

335

students reported escalation of their anxiety to moderate-severe levels during the COVID-19

336

pandemic.However, 82.2% of the students in our study reported moderate to severe distress. This

337

difference in distress protportions coud be as a result of different scales used and cross-cultural

338

factors.In the same study , the researchers found significant factors that affected the students’ anxiety

339

level including the economic situation of the students , and the disruptions in students’ life (Husky et

340

al., 2020). These factors were also reported in our study as pandemic induced concerns as perceived

341

by the students .However , in our study , we have not collected data about the students’ or their families

342

financial status ; thus we could not consider it in our regression analysis to examine its influence on

343

the distress levels.

344

Jordanian universities have been taking humble attempts to implement distance learning into their

345

educational system since 2015 .Nevertheless, this strategy has been considered as a “challenging

346

pedagogy” of the learning system in the country due to many obstacles (Al-Jaghoub et al., 2009; Atoum
12

347

et al., 2017; Al Nawas, 2020). During the COVID-19 pandemic and after realising the need to

348

implement an emergency distance learning strategy, more serious steps were taken by decision makers

349

at higher education sector and the Jordanian universities trying to guarantee a smooth shifting process

350

coupled with ensuring a quality education as well. Besides, psychological distress was reported to be

351

associated with distance learning and working from homes during the current pandemic. A recent

352

qualitative study has addressed many of the distance learning’s challenges including personal,

353

technological, course-related as well as cultural challenges (Almaiah et al., 2020).These challenges

354

might explain why most of the students (n=209, 45.9% ) in our study resported the lack of motivation

355

for distance learning, especially within the Jordanian context where most of educational activities were

356

used to be delivered by in-person attendance to universities/colleges with less attention to distance

357

learning .

358

Besides, smoking exhibited a risk factor for suffering from higher levels of psychological distress

359

among the students in our study, and this could be explained by the bi-directional relatiohship between

360

smoking and mental wellbeing as addressed previously in a longitudinal study in Australia (Leung et

361

al., 2012). Emotional and behavioural reactions toward the COVID-19 pandemic could vary . The type

362

of coping strategy and the extent of adopting it also differs between individuals . In the present study,

363

some students (12.9%) reported the use of various medicinal drugs as a result of pandemic induced

364

distress. Although the figure is small but this raises a concern about the psychosocial response of some

365

individuals in response to crisis which might lead to a risky behaviour such as substance abuse

366

.Therefore, more serious efforts should be done to spread awareness about healthy coping styles among

367

different social components of the community (Pfefferbaum and North, 2020).

368

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in Jordan to assess the psychological distress

369

among university students using the 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10) during the

370

COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this study is amongst the limited litratures to highlight the

371

distressing concerns brought about by online distance learning on university students in Jordan. Still,

372

there are limitations that should be carefully taken into consideration when interpreting the results and

373

include (i) using a non-probabilistic convenience sampling, which affects the representativness of our

374

sample and limits the generalizability of our results. However, this sampling strategy was believed to

375

fit in lieu of the current circumstances of the nationwide curfew, the closure of all universities and

376

colleges in the country and shifting to online platforms (ii) the majority of respondents were

377

undergraduates; we could have seen different results if our sample had more postgraduate students,

378

and (iii) We had a relatively small sample size which could be attributed to the limited period of data

379

collection .There was a technical difficulty to follow up the survey and keep it visible to students within

380

social media groups due to the large number of academic enquiries posted on these groups ;thus,

381

enforced our survey link to lose its visibility among the numerous recent posts .Also, the busy schedule

382

of students (in the midst of a new distance learning strategy) might have affected their interests to

383

participate in the survey (iv) The survey represented self reported states thus , over reporting or

384

underreporting of psychological status could be expected , (v) The inherent limitation of cross-

385

sectional studies which prevent assessing temporality of events i.e psychogoligcal distress could be

386

present prior to the pandemic and just escalated during it, and lastly , (vi) We missed the perspectives

387

of non-arabic speaking students in Jordan as the questionnaire was designed in Arabic only.

388

Nevertheless, findings from our study shed the lights on various degrees of psychological distress that

389

the university students have experienced during the current pandemic, and they could be considered as

390

a vulnerable group. Also, the findings of our study encourage for further follow up research on this

391

topic using a nationally representative sample of university students with more specific scales for

392

psychological distress symptoms.

393

The results of this study provide new insights to direct policy makers and decision makers in the fields

394

of higher education, as well as mental health. More attention and monitoring of college students’

395

mental health should be sought. Since distance learning was the highest reported concern among

396

students, faculty members should implement effective methods to make distance learning more

397

interactive and students friendly. Psychological interventions should be implemented by psychologists

398

and psychiatrists to provide guidance, psychoeducation, and mental health counseling to university

399

students. There should be more active involvement with students’ psychological health, coupled with

400

educating them on how to deal with psychological distress during unprecedented situations like the

401

current pandemic.

402

At the current circumstances of COVID-19 preventive measures in Jordan (curfew and social

403

distancing), psychological support could be provided to university students through publicly available

404

online videos, television programs, and online/phone consultations. Also, mental health support could

405

be provided through a hotline service to provide students with instructions about dealing with their

406

academic stressors and other related mental health issues during this pandemic.

407

Moreover, efforts should be made to improve communications with college students’ and guide them

408

on how to access only evidence-based information from reliable resources about the pandemic.

409

Besides, a comprehensive nationwide psychological support program should be developed and

410

incorporated into Jordan’s response strategy in combating the COVID-19. Future studies should assess

411

the effect of implementing these suggested interventions on students’ mental health. Furthermore, as

412

the levels of psychological distress are expected to be dynamic over the upcoming period, it is wise to

413

monitor and assess the impact of easing up the governmental restrictions, i.e. ending the curfew and

414

returning to on-campus teaching, on the levels of psychological distress and anxiety among university

415

students in Jordan.

416

417

The control and preventive measures that are implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted

418

in a severe disruption of various human life activities. The fear of the infection itself, along with the

419

strict public health measures could impact the mental health of individuals. Our study highlighted a

420

significant psychological distress among university students in Jordan during the COVID-19 pandemic

421

and its related control measures.. A significant proportion of the students were highly concerned about

422

and distressed by the distance learning strategy; thus, prompt actions should be taken to improve the

423

distance learning experience and solve any associated technostress. In addition, a nationwide

424

psychological support program should be incorporated into Jordan’s preparedness plan and response

425

strategy in combating the COVID-19 pandemic and other crisis, considering students and other

426

vulnerable groups in the community.
