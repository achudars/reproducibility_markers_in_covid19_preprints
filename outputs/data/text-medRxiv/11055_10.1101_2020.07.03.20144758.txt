ABSTRACT
Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory
diagnostic services. We evaluated the performance of one LDT and two commercial tests,
cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and Amplidiag® COVID-19 (Mobidiag), for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens. 183 specimens collected from suspected
COVID-19 patients were studied with all three methods to compare their performance. In
relation to the reference standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the
three studied methods, the positive percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas® test
(100%), followed by Amplidiag® test and the LDT (98.9%). The negative percent agreement
(NPA) was lowest for cobas® test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag® test (98.8%) and the
highest value was obtained for LDT (100%). The dilution series conducted for specimens,
however, suggests significantly higher sensitivity for the cobas® assay in comparison with
the other two assays and the low NPA value may be due to the same reason. In general, all
tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and hands-on time
per sample were shortest for cobas® test. Clinical laboratories need to be prepared for
uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months in mitigation of the
pandemic. To secure that, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain
several simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing.

Introduction
Mitigation of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires reliable and accessible laboratory
diagnostic services. The specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on molecular
methods, especially on RT-PCR, although other technologies including serologic
immunoassays are emerging1,2. The first methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection were laboratory
developed RT-PCR tests (LDTs), one of the first methods published was described by
Corman et al.3. This method was later endorsed by WHO and widely implemented in clinical
laboratories. Roche Molecular Systems (Branchburg, NJ, USA) cobas® SARS-Cov-2 test
was the first commercial test to get EUA from FDA on March 12 2020. Since then (as of
June 25, 2020) more than 100 commercial molecular IVD-tests have been granted the FDA
or other national authorities’ EUA and/or CE-mark4. Both LDTs and commercial tests have
been set up in a high time pressure. Therefore, it is of great importance to evaluate the tests in
clinical laboratory settings. In this study we evaluated the performance of one LDT and two
commercial tests, namely cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) and recently CE/IVD marked
Amplidiag® COVID-19 (Mobidiag, Espoo, Finland), for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
in respiratory specimens.

Material and Methods
Specimens
Altogether 237 respiratory tract specimens referred to Helsinki University Hospital
Laboratory (HUS Diagnostic Center, HUSLAB), Department of Virology and Immunology,
Finland were included in this study. 54 specimens collected from patients with respiratory
symptoms in 2018-2020 were used to verify analytical specificity of the tests. The specimens
from 2020 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the LDT. 183 specimens collected from

suspected COVID-19 patients in 2020 were studied with all three methods to compare the
performance of the tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Although most of the specimens
tested were nasopharyngeal swabs, also oropharyngeal and nasal swabs were included due to
the global shortage of the swab sticks needed for nasopharyngeal sampling. The specimens
were collected either in Copan UTM (Copan, Brescia, Italy) or in tubes containing 0.9%
saline due to the global shortage of Copan UTM tubes. The suitability of the 0.9% saline
tubes as alternative to viral transport media for SARS-CoV-2 testing has been shown before5.

The specimens (n=183) deployed to compare the performance of the three
studied RT-PCR methods comprised of two sets of specimens collected within two time
frames. The first set of specimens (n=37) was part of the material used for the initial
verification of cobas® SARS-CoV-2/Amplidiag® COVID-19 tests. These specimens were
collected between March 5 and March 18, 2020, and the SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens
(n=18) represent virus strains from the early epidemic. The second set of specimens (n=146)
were collected between May 4 and May 8 2020, and the positive specimens (n=90) thus
represent strains from a declining phase of the epidemic in Finland. Specimens were stored at
-20 °C/-70 °C after initial analysis and were thawn upon analysis. Specimens were not thawn
more than twice before RT-PCR.

In addition, QCMD 2020 Coronavirus Outbreak Preparedness EQA Pilot Study
proficiency samples (Glasgow, Scotland, UK) were used to evaluate the performance of the
methods.

All specimens were inactivated in a biosafety cabinet in a biosafety level 2 laboratory that has
a negative pressure. At the beginning of the epidemic FFP3 mask, protective glasses and
protective clothing were worn during working in the laboratory. Later in the epidemic visor
and surgical mask replaced the FFP3 masks and protective glasses.

Laboratory developed test (LDT), HUSLAB
The possible SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen was inactivated by adding 250 µl of MagNA
Pure Lysis/Binding Buffer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) to 250 µl of
patient specimen. Lysates were incubated for a minimum of 10 minutes before processed
further.

Cobas® SARS-CoV-2
If needed, the specimens were first equilibrated to room temperature, after which the possible
SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen was inactivated by adding 350 µl of MagNA Pure
Lysis/Binding Buffer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) to 350 µl of patient
specimen. Lysates were incubated for a minimum of 10 minutes before processed further.

Amplidiag® COVID-19
The possible SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen was inactivated either by adding 600 µl of the
specimen to an eNAT-tube (Copan) or 360 µl to an mNAT-tube (Mobidiag). eNAT tubes
were incubated for a minimum of 30 minutes and mNAT-tubes for a minimum of 5 minutes
before processed further.

Molecular methods evaluated in the study

Laboratory developed test (LDT), HUSLAB

The real-time LDT SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR used in this study is a modification of the method
published by Corman et al.3. The test is suitable for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from
sputum, nasopharyngeal/tracheal aspirates, nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab
specimens and faeces. Initially, all target genes (E, RdRP and N) were included in the
diagnostic assay. In addition, a PCR for beta-globin gene6 was performed in order to verify
successful sampling, extraction and PCR. Full-length SARS-CoV in vitro transcript was used
as a positive control. When the epidemic spread and there was suddenly a high demand of
testing in combination with the global shortage of supplies, we first dropped out the E-genePCR, because of the occasional unspecific positive signal obtained from negative
controls/specimens7. Later also RdRP was excluded and the diagnostics were continued with
the N-gene-PCR only. The N-gene-PCR was chosen because a dilution series indicated better
sensitivity for the N-gene-PCR over RdRP-PCR, although earlier ct-values were gained for
RdRP-PCR. Also, findings from low positive specimens suggested better sensitivity for Ngene-RT-PCR (data not shown).

Nucleic acids were extracted from 450 µl respiratory specimen lysate using the
MagNA Pure Viral NA SV 2.0 Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), with
the MagNA Pure 96-instrument, and eluted in 50 µl of the elution buffer.

Real time RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit
with 600 nM of the forward primer CACATTGGCACCCGCAATC, 800 nM of the reverse
primer GAGGAACGAGAAGAGGCTTG and 200 nM of the probe FAMACTTCCTCAAGGAACAACATTGCCA-BBQ3. RT-PCR reaction was performed on
Stratagene Mx3005p PCR instrument (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, United
States). Positive and negative controls were included in each run. Five µl of the extracted
eluate was subjected to 25 µl PCR-reaction with cycling conditions of: 1 cycle of 55 °C for
20 min, 1 cycle of 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 15 sec and 58 °C for
40 sec.

Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test

The cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test (Roche Molecular Systems) is a qualitative test for fully
automated cobas® 6800/8800 platforms. The test is validated to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA
from nasal, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. The test amplifies two
SARS-CoV-2 targets: orf1ab (Target 1), which is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and a conserved
region of the E-gene (Target 2), which is pan-Sarbeco specific and detects also SARS-CoV
and other Sarbecoviruses currently unknown to infect humans. In addition, the test includes
an internal RNA-control (IC), which is added to the specimens before extraction. The test
includes also positive and negative controls, which are processed the same way as the
samples.

600 µl of specimen lysate was subjected to cobas® 6800 system. Testing was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions apart from the inactivation step.

Amplidiag COVID-19 test

The Amplidiag® COVID-19 test (Mobidiag) is a qualitative test for the detection of SARSCoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal specimens. The test amplifies two SARS-CoV-2 targets:
orf1ab and N-gene, which are both specific for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the test amplifies
the human RNase P gene (RP), which serves as a sampling control. The test includes positive
and negative control.

eNAT or mNAT tubes were subjected to Amplidiag® Easy system, which
extracts nucleic acids and does the PCR setup. The PCR plate was then transferred to a real
time PCR-machine (CFX-96, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), which contains the Amplidiag®
Analyzer software. The Amplidiag® Analyzer software transfers directly data from
Amplidiag® Easy system and automates the result interpretation. Testing was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, apart from the specimen type (validated only for
nasopharyngeal specimens) and inactivation step with eNAT-tubes.

A new version of the Amplidiag Easy Script Package (v. 5.1.0) and Amplidiag
COVID-19 Kit Configuration (v2-0-1) were introduced by the manufacturer during the
evaluation. The new version is not collecting data from the first 10 amplification cycles and
therefore the obtained ct values are 10 cycles less than with the old version. The new

software version was introduced in order to get rid of the drift problems seen with the orf1ab
target (false positive interpretations of the old software). Since the new software did not
allow analysis of the old data, 147 specimens from this evaluation were rerun from the same
mNAT tubes within 5 days from the first run.

Workflow evaluation of the studied tests

We compared the turnaround time (TAT), hands-on time and capacity of the tests. An
experienced lab technician performed all three tests and measured time needed for each stage
by stopwatch. The specimen inactivation step was excluded from this analysis.

Verification of the performance of all three studied methods on specimens collected to Copan
UTM versus 0.9 % saline and using eNAT versus mNAT in the lysing/inactivation step with
Amplidiag COVID-19 test

When the epidemic started, the specimens were collected to Copan UTM tubes (3 ml), but
later to tubes containing 1.5 ml of 0.9% saline, because of the global shortage in supply of the
Copan tubes. In order to verify that the used methods were performing at the same level two
independent dilution series were constructed: (i). A patient specimen known to contain
SARS-CoV-2 RNA originally collected to Copan tube was diluted to pooled Copan-collected
negative specimen. (ii). A patient specimen known to contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA originally
collected to 0.9% saline was diluted to pooled 0.9% saline-collected negative specimen. The
ct-value for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was around 24 for both the Copan-collected

and saline-collected original positive specimens. A dilution series of 1:10 - 1:100000 for both
specimens (in Copan UTM or saline) in respective specimen pools were constructed and
analyzed with all three studied methods.

Due to the shortage of the eNAT tubes a change to mNAT tubes was necessary.
This change was evaluated with a small number of specimens. Eleven specimens defined
positive by the cobas® test were inactivated/lysed in parallel by pipetting the specimen to an
mNAT and eNAT tube and analyzed in the same PCR run.

Analytical specificity

The analytical specificity of the tests was studied by analyzing patient specimens containing
other respiratory viruses. Altogether 54 specimens were included, but not all samples were
run with all three methods. Some of the specimens contained several viruses (n=11). In four
specimens, the presence of a respiratory virus nucleic acid was defined by xTAG RVP Fast
(Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) assay, and in 50 specimens by the Allplex
Respiratory Panel 1/2/3 (Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea). The specimens were chosen to
contain moderate to high concentrations of viral nucleic acids (ct-value <30 for specimens by
Seegene test or high mean fluorescence intensity for Luminex test). The specimens were
collected during 2018-2020 representing recent virus strains in Finland. The specimens are
described in Table 1.

The positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) including twosided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with an on-line MEDCALC® tool
(https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php). The overall agreement of the evaluated
assays was evaluated by the kappa value, which was calculated (including two-sided 95% CI)
with an on-line QuickCalcs tool (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/kappa1/). Kappa
values were interpreted as follows: No agreement (< 0), slight agreement (0-0.20), fair
agreement (0.21-0.40), moderate agreement (0.41-0.60), substantial agreement (0.61-0.80),
and almost perfect agreement (0.81-1). All values were calculated relative to the reference
standard, which was established as the result obtained by two of the three studied methods.
The significance of the difference of the ct values obtained by Amplidiag® test from eNAT
vs mNAT tubes was estimated by two tailed students T-test. P-value < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results

Clinical performance of the evaluated assays

Altogether, 183 specimens were analyzed by all three evaluated methods. One specimen gave
an invalid result by cobas® SARS-Cov-2 test (0.5%), two specimens had an incorrect amount
of specimen lysate in LDT and were therefore considered invalid (1.1%), and 10 specimens
gave failed results by Amplidiag® COVID-19 test (5.5%). The failed/invalid specimens were
excluded from the agreement analysis. In relation to the reference standard the positive
percent agreement (PPA) was highest for cobas® test (100%), followed by Amplidiag® test
(98.9%) and the LDT (98.9%). Negative percent agreement (NPA) was lowest for cobas®
test (89.4%), followed by Amplidiag® test (98.8%) and the best specificity value was
obtained for LDT (100%). The overall agreement as defined by kappa-value was excellent for
all studied tests (Table 2).

Workflow analysis of the tests

The TAT for the cobas® test was 3 h 30 min for 80 samples; for Amplidiag® test 3 h 30 min
for 48 samples; and for the LDT test 4 h 30 min for 93 samples. The hands-on-time was
shortest for the cobas® test (Table 3).

Performance comparison of the evaluated methods on specimens collected to Copan UTM
versus 0.9 % saline

Two independent dilution series of two positive specimens were constructed to 0.9% saline
and copan UTM in respiratory specimen matrix to verify that specimens collected to Copan
and saline perform at the same level with the evaluated methods. The results indicate similar
performance of all three methods independent of the collection media used (Table 4 and
Figure 1). However, the data suggest higher overall sensitivity for the cobas® test as the
dilution 1:20000 was still positive for both RT-PCR targets in the cobas® test, while 1:2001:1000 was the last dilution yielding positive test results in the LDT and in the Amplidiag®
test. The experiment was repeated with similar results. In the repeated experiment the last
dilution with positive result with LDT and Amplidiag® test was 1:100 (both for samples in
saline and Copan), while positive result was obtained for both targets in 1:10000 dilution by
the cobas® test.

Verification of eNAT versus mNAT tubes in the lysing/inactivation step with Amplidiag
COVID-19 test

Of the 11 specimens defined positive by the cobas® test, 8 were positive with Amplidiag®
test independent of the tube used for lysing/inactivation. Of the 8 specimens positive by the
Amplidiag® test the difference in N gene and orf1ab target ct values were calculated and for
the RNase P gene (sampling control) the difference was calculated from all 11 specimens.
The mean difference in ct values was 0.77 for the N gene (P=0.004), 0.87 (P=0.189) for the
orf1ab target and 1.98 for the RNase P-gene (P=0.026).

Analysis of QCMD proficiency panel

QCMD 2020 Coronavirus Outbreak Preparedness EQA Pilot Study proficiency samples were
used to evaluate the performance of the evaluated methods. The cobas® test and LDT were in
100% agreement with the QCMD expected results. Amplidiag® test failed to identify one
SARS-CoV-2 positive result with SARS-CoV-2 concentration of 3.3 log 10 copies/ml (Table
5). However, the test identified correctly another sample containing SARS-CoV-2 RNA 2.3
log10 copies/ml. Amplidiag® test reported four samples as failed because the EQA samples
lack human RNase P target needed for valid negative results with the test.

Analytical specificity

None of the studied SARS-CoV-2 tests gave positive result from patient specimens
containing other respiratory viruses (Table 1).

Discrepant analyses

Altogether, there were 12 discrepant results. In one specimen, which only gave a positive
result with Amplidiag® the positive signal was obtained for the orf1ab target with ct value of
40.8. However, in the amplification curve provided by Amplidiag® analyzer software no

specific amplification could be seen. Instead of the expected logarithmic rise in the
fluorescence signal, only a slow rise in background signal was seen (data not shown). For 1
specimen a positive result was obtained with cobas® and Amplidiag® tests, but a negative
result with LDT. In one specimen positive results were obtained for cobas® test and LDT,
while the Amplidiag® test gave a negative result. In that case the specimen had gone through
2 freeze-thaw cycles before it was analyzed by Amplidiag® test, but only one or none when
analyzed by cobas® or LTD tests, respectively. In 9 specimens a positive result was obtained
only by cobas® test. However, positive result was obtained for two specimens, when rerun
with the new Amplidiag® COVID-19 software version. In all 9 specimens positive signal
was obtained for both amplification targets of the test, but the ct values were high, >30 for
8/9 specimens. (Table 6A).

Performance of the new software version of Amplidiag COVID-19 test

Of the 147 specimens run with both the new and old software version of the Amplidiag®
COVID-19 test 11 specimens gave failed result with version 1 or version 2 of the software or
both (n=2) and were excluded from the analysis. 73 positive and 63 negative results were
obtained by the old software and 68 positive and 68 negative results by the new version.
There were 9 discrepant results. The specimen that gave false positive result by the earlier
version of the Amplidiag software was negative in the new run with the new Amplidiag
software. Four specimens that were positive with the old version gave negative result by the
new version, even though there was amplification from the orf1ab target. An additional two
specimens were positive with the old version and negative with the new version without
amplification from orf1ab target. Two specimens negative by the old version, a positive result

was obtained when rerun with the new software version. These two specimens were positive
by cobas® assay only in the comparison of the three methods (Table 6B)

Discussion
In general, all tested assays performed adequately. Both the time from sample to result and
hands-on time per sample were shortest for cobas® test. The cobas® and Amplidiag® assays
allow for an automatic transfer of the results to the laboratory information system. On the
other hand, both LDT and Amplidag® allow for the evaluation of the actual amplification
curves, which is very important for the quality assurance of the results, especially when the
tests have been set up in a straining timetable.

Of the three RT-PCR methods evaluated in this study, cobas® SARS-CoV-2
test showed the best overall performance for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical
respiratory specimens. In the absence of a gold standard, the reference value was created as a
consensus of two methods. The agreement between the different methods tested was
excellent. However, the positive percent agreement was highest for cobas® SARS-CoV-2
test (100%), while its negative percent agreement was the lowest (89.4%). All the specimens
positive only with cobas® SARS-Cov-2 test had high ct-values (>30), with one exception,
where ct-values of 28.6 (orf1) and 29.1 (E-gene) were obtained. The dilution series conducted
for specimens collected in Copan UTM vs. 0.9% saline, however, suggests significantly
higher sensitivity for the cobas® assay in comparison with the other two assays and the low
NPA value may well be due to the same reason. Previous studies also suggest high sensitivity
for the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test8,9. The second commercial test evaluated, the Amplidiag®
COVID-19 test obtained same PPA (98.9%) as LDT, but lower NPA (98.8% vs. 100%

respectively). There was one specimen that was positive by Amplidiag® COVID-19 test
only, which seemed to be a false positive by interpretation of the amplification curve of the
positive target (orf1ab). This specimen was negative by the new Amplidiag® software
version, which did not give any false interpretation of negative results in this study. However,
it seems that what is gained in specificity is lost in sensitivity: With the new software version
three specimens positive by the old version gave negative results, even though specific
amplification from the orf1ab target could be seen. All things considered, Amplidiag® test
seems to perform on the same par with LDT, apart from the relatively high failure rate with
Amplidiag® test (5.5%). The comparison of results from eNAT tubes versus mNAT tubes
suggests that the Amplidiag® test is for some reason less sensitive (later ct value) for the
sampling control (RNase P gene) from mNAT tubes. The difference in obtained ct values was
greater for RNase P gene (~2 ct cycles) than for the specific virus targets (<1 ct cycle). This
was also observed in the rising failure percent (from 3.8 % to 8.4%, data not shown) when the

We analyzed the QCMD 2020 Coronavirus Outbreak Preparedness EQA Pilot
Study with all the evaluated methods available in our laboratory. The cobas® test and LDT
identified all samples correctly. Amplidiag® missed repeatedly one specimen with dPCR
reference value of 3.3 log10 copies/ml, although it correctly identified another sample with
dPCR reference value of 2.3 log10 copies/ml. In addition, Amplidiag® test yielded a failed
test result for 4 samples, as these samples lacked human RNase P target needed for a valid
negative result with the test. The lack of correct matrix in EQA samples is a major drawback
in general. The performance of the test identifying the target virus may be very different in
the correct matrix in comparison to virus alone. Human nucleic acids, if not yielding a false
positive result in a PCR, may take force from the amplification reaction (e.g. if primers

and/or probe have binding sites in human genome or transcriptome). For example, the LDT
amplifies virus positive specimens without human matrix more efficiently than specimens
with human matrix included (data not shown).

It is common that RNA-viruses accumulate mutations at high frequency since
RNA-polymerase lacks proofreading activity. Indeed, there is evidence that also SARS-CoV2 is evolving during time and mutations may occur in the target area of molecular tests used.
A previous report suggests that a mutation has already occurred in the target region of the
cobas® SARS-CoV-2 E-gene test10. In this study, all specimens gave a positive signal for
both target genes by cobas® test. Fortunately, the test uses a dual target approach, which
means that the mutation proposed to be in the target area of the cobas® E-gene test does not
compromise correct results. This highlights the importance of a dual target approach11-13.

Many countries are now (in July 2020) moving from lock-down to “test, trace
and isolate” strategy in their COVID-19 mitigation, which requires a large capacity for
sensitive and reliable SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing. Clinical laboratories need to be
prepared for uninterrupted high-throughput testing during the coming months. In order to
achieve this, laboratories need to deploy optional testing methods for the event of breakage in
instrumentation, as well as prepare for the ongoing global shortage in testing supplies.
Therefore, it is of critical importance for clinical laboratories to maintain several
simultaneous platforms in their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing, and continuously monitor
the performance of the assays used.

Figure legend
Figure 1 Comparison of the performance of the three studied methods using a dilution series
in Copan UTM or 0.9% saline tubes. A known positive sample was diluted in either pooled
Copan-collected negative specimen or saline-collected negative specimen. A) Cobas®
SARS-CoV-2 test results. The test was positive for both targets at a dilution 1:20 000 for
both Copan and saline samples. Target 2 was detected with both tubes still in dilution 1:100
000. B) Amplidiag® COVID-19 results. Amplidiag test was positive for both targets in
Copan and saline tubes at 1:200 dilution but at 1:1000 and 1:2000 only in Copan tubes
(positive for both targets at 1:1000 and only N-gene positive at 1:2000). No target was
detected at dilutions 1:10 000 – 1:100 000. C) LDT assay. No target was detected at dilutions
1:2000-1:100 00. The Y axis is modified to show only ct’s 24-40 to allow for better
visualization of the differences.
