Abstract
Korean public health authorities raised the public alert to its highest level on February 23,

27

2020 to mitigate the 2019 novel coronavirus disease epidemic. We have identified that the mean

28

delay from symptom onset to isolation was reduced to one day after raising the alert. Vigilance

29

can reduce this interval.

Main text

32

Since the first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in South

33

Korea on January 20, 2020 [1], COVID-19 has infected 9,887 people and killed 165 in South

34

Korea as of April 1, 2020 [2]. In the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Korea, Korean

35

public health authorities mainly conducted contact tracing of confirmed cases and quarantining

36

of confirmed and suspected cases [1]. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases increased,

37

Korean public health authorities raised the infectious disease alert to red alert on February 23,

38

2020 [3]. Central disaster and safety countermeasures were set up and addressed the public alert

39

to report illness related to COVID-19 to public health authorities for screening.

40

To assess the response’s impact during the highest alert phase in Korea, we obtained data

41

on 576 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and

42

Prevention, the city department of public health, and news reports for February 1–March 30,

43

2020. We extracted information about confirmed cases using a structured data-extraction form.

44

We used case-based data on the date of exposure of confirmed cases, date of illness onset, and

45

date of isolation. We compared the time interval from illness onset to isolation before and during

46

the red alert (after February 23, 2020), assuming that the number of intervals was log-normal,

47

Weibull, or gamma-distributed (Appendix). Further, we conducted a similar analysis to identify

48

the interval from exposure to isolation. The range of intervals was reported with 95% confidence

49

intervals (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles). To identify the difference between these intervals in the

50

early epidemic and during the red alert, we conducted a Mann–Whitney U test. All statistical

51

analyses were performed in R version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

52
53

Of the 576 laboratory-confirmed cases reported (6% of the 9,786 Korean COVID-19
cases as of March 31, 2020), 211 included the date of exposure, illness onset, or isolation and

54

were analyzed (Appendix). The mean delay between symptom onset and isolation was 4.3 days

55

(95% CI 0.5–11.3 days) in the early phase and 3.3 days (95% CI: 0.5–9.4 days) during the red

56

alert. This reduction was significantly lower than in the early phase of COVID-19 epidemics in

57

Korea (p-value = 0.02). The mean delay from exposure to a confirmed case to isolation was 7.2

58

days (95% CI 1.7–14.4 days) before the red alert and 6.5 days (95% 1.7–15.7 days) during the

59

red alert (Figure). Therefore, the mean delay was shortened by 0.8 days; however, this was not

60

significantly lower (p-value = 0.07).

61

Most COVID-19 transmissions occur during the presentation of symptoms of cases;

62

therefore, we believe that COVID-19-affected countries are making efforts to reduce the time

63

delay from symptom onset to isolation by strengthening countrywide surveillance and control

64

programs for COVID-19. In Korea, to enhance the surveillance, public health authorities have

65

operated 80 drive-through screening centers (operated since February 23, 2020) and have

66

designated 341 private hospitals as public relief hospitals for COVID-19 (operated since

67

February 25, 2020) [4, 5]. This provided easier access to screening tests for suspected cases of

68

COVID-19 in the community compared to the early phase and could reduce the interval from

69

symptom onset to isolation.

70

The delay from illness onset to isolation early in the epidemic in Korea is relatively

71

shorter than that in China (mean estimate of 5.8 days, 95% CI 4.3–7.5 in early January 2020) [6].

72

However, more efforts are needed from public health authorities and the public to prevent the

73

potential spread of COVID-19 in communities since the infectiousness of COVID-19 begins

74

before illness onset [7].

75

Our study has some limitations. We estimated the time delay based on self-reported data

76

and obtained data from various sources. Additional studies should incorporate more detailed

77

information from additional laboratory-confirmed cases.

78
79

Efforts to reduce this interval are ongoing in South Korea and vigilance in other countries
can reduce this interval.
