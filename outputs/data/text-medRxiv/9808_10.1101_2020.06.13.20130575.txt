ABSTRACT
Background
During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic little
information has been available about patients with mild or moderate
symptoms attended and followed in the primary care setting, most of
whom had an unknown status for the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
Objectives
We aim to measure the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARSCoV-2 infection in a community sample of asymptomatic individuals
and among symptomatic patients (without confirmed diagnosis)
followed in a primary care setting.
As a secondary objective, we estimated the proportions of
symptomatic patients seeing at an emergency department (ED),
hospitalized or dying, and identified the most important clinical
symptoms associated with a positive infection.
Methods
From April 21 to April 24 2020, we selected a random sample of 600
individuals stratified by age groups, from a total population of 19,899
individuals from a community area in Barcelona (study population 1).
From April 29 to May 5 2020, we also invited all the patients that had
been followed by general practitioners (GPs) (study population 2).
We used for both populations COVID-19 Rapid lateral flow
immunoassay which qualitatively assesses the presence of patientgenerated IgG and IgM in approximately 10-15 minutes.
The prevalence (95% confidence intervals [CI]) of infection (past and
current) was defined as the proportion of individuals with antibody
seropositivity. Odds ratios (ORs) for a positive test result were
estimated using logistic regression analysis.
Results
Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals from the
randomly selected sample accepted to participate in the study. The
overall mean age was 43.7 years (SD 21.79, range 1-94) and 55%
were women. Seventeen individuals were seropositive for IgM and/or
IgG, resulting an overall prevalence of 5,47% (95% CI, 3.44-8.58).
Six-hundred and thirty-four symptomatic patients were followed by
GPs. The overall mean age was 46.97 years (SD 20.05, range 0-92)
and 57.73% were women. Of these, 244 patients (38.49%) were
seropositive for IgM and/or IgG.

During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients
attended the ED, 11.83% were hospitalized and about 2% died.
Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
the OR for a positive test was significantly increased in patients who
had fever (>38oC), ageusia and contact with a patient diagnosed with
COVID-19.
Conclusions
The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among
asymptomatic individuals in the general population was lower than
expected.
Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs
during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive.
Fever (>38oC), anosmia, ageusia and contact with a patient
diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with a positive test result.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is a major challenge for health systems,
citizens and policy makers worldwide (1). Given the alarming levels
of spread, severity of disease, and number of affected countries, on
March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
COVID-19 as a pandemic (2).
A report of the London Scholl of Hygiene and Tropical medicine on
April 30th estimated that since Spain has recently seen a large
increase in the number of deaths, and given its smaller population,
15% of the population could be infected (3).
Contrary to other countries, Spain had not implemented, until very
recently, an intensive testing strategy for suspected cases of COVID19 infection using PCR swab testing or rapid antibody testing in the
primary care setting. The lack of intensive testing and subsequent
tracking of cases and close contacts is likely to be one of the key
factors contributing to the rapid widespread of the infection and the
high number of coronavirus deaths relative to its population.
Therefore, since the beginning of the pandemic we decided to
implement in our primary health care area a comprehensive program
which included four components: a seroprevalence study in
asymptomatic patients, a follow-up study in symptomatic patients, a
survey in institutionalized patients, and a survey in health care
workers. Monitorization of patients reporting mild or moderate
symptoms compatible with COVID-19, consisted of a close follow-up
of patients by general practitioners (GPs) every 24 or 48 hours
through telephone contacts to ensure that patients maintained selfisolation from day 7 to day 14 until symptoms disappeared and
promptly refer patients developing severe symptoms, to the
emergency department at one of the hospitals in the health care
area.
We present here results of the first two components.
Study objectives
This study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals in a community setting, and
to characterize the antibody profile in suspected cases with mild or
moderate symptoms, followed by GPs since the beginning of the
pandemic.

Methods
Study design
The seroprevalence study in asymptomatic patients used a crosssectional survey approach to recruit individuals for participation in the
study.
The follow-up study used an observational prospective follow-up
approach for monitoring suspected cases of COVID-19 followed by
primary care physicians.
Study population
For the seroprevalence study (study population 1) we selected a
random sample of 600 individuals one year or older, stratified by age
groups (1-14,15-29,30-39,40-49,50-59,60-69,70- >80 years) from a
total population of 19,899 individuals registered in a primary health
care center, from a community area of Barcelona, Spain.
Institutionalized patients, terminally ill patients, suspected cases of
COVID-19 infection, and patients tested positive for COVID-19 prior
to recruitment, were excluded.
For the follow-up study (study population 2) we included all patients
aged one year or older consulting the primary care physician either
face-to-face or by phone with mild or moderate symptoms (without a
confirmed diagnosis) during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2 to
April 24, 2020. These patients were followed mostly by phone, every
24 or 48 hours until the resolution of symptoms or referral to a
hospital, as appropriate.
Setting
Individuals from both study populations were invited to attend a
municipality center for the elderly (close down during the pandemic)
located near-by the primary health care center. A team of trained
GPs, nurses, and medical students carried out the survey from April
21 to April 24, 2020, (study population 1) and from April 29 to May 5,
2020 (study population 2).
We used for both populations COVID-19 capillary blood draws and a
lateral flow immunoassay which qualitatively assessed the presence
of patient-generated IgG and IgM in about 10-15 minutes.
Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire using a
web-based platform designed for the study (studies4Covid) by
Universal Doctor- a social enterprise developing technology solutions
for global health- and EAP Sardenya. The questionnaire was installed
in tablet computers to facilitate collection of data.

All adult participants provided verbal consent to participate in the
survey. For children and adolescents, written consent from a legal
representative, was required.
The study design was reviewed and approved by the ethics
committee of the Institut Universitari d’Investigació en Atenció
Primària (IDIAP Jordi Gol) (number 20/104-P).
Main study endpoints
The prevalence of infection (past and current) in asymptomatic
individuals was defined by antibody seropositivity. For the
symptomatic patients with COVID-19-compatible symptoms followed
by GPs, the endpoints of interest were the proportion of patients with
antibody seropositivity, the proportion of patients seeing at the
emergency department (ED), the proportion of hospitalized patients
and proportion of deaths.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated, using means and SD for
continuous variables and frequencies and percentages with 95% CI
for categorical variables.
Univariate analyses were performed including all the variables and
comparing positive cases versus negative cases. Significant variables
were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis (using a
stepwise procedure selection) to identify factors influencing positive
antibodies test result.
All the analyses were conducted using the STATA 14 version.

Results
Seroprevalence study (Study population 1)
Three hundred and eleven asymptomatic individuals agreed to
participate (response rate of 52%). Main reasons for non-responses
included among others, difficulties in reaching people through
telephone calls, concerns related to breaking of confinement and
important comorbidities. The overall mean age of participants was
43.7 years (SD 21.79, range 1-94), and 55% were women.
None of the participants had been tested previously for SARS-CoV-2
by rRT-PCR.
Of the 311 participants, 17 were seropositive for IgM and/or IgG,
resulting a prevalence of 5.47% (95%CI 3.44-8.58). Six patients had
both IgG and IgM positive, 6 patients had only IgM positive and 5
patients has only IgG positive. Women had a higher seroprevalence
than men (6.43% vs 4.28%)

Prevalence data by age groups is shown in Figure 1. The highest
prevalence was found in the age group of 80 years of age or older.
Observational study and patient follow-up (Study population
2)
During the period of follow-up, 12 patients died (4 male, 8 female),
10 of whom were seropositive.
Seven-hundred and forty-three symptomatic patients were followed
by GPs for two months, and 634 underwent the serological test
(participation rate of 85.33%). The overall mean age was 46.97 years
(SD 20.0, range 0-92) and 57. 73% were women. Of these, 244
patients (38.49%, 95%CI 34.78%-42.33%) were seropositive for IgM
and/or IgG.
During the follow-up period, 27.13% of symptomatic patients
attended the ED and 11.83% were hospitalized.
Forty and one patients had a previous SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR
performed, 25 were positive and 16 negative. Sixteen out of the 25
PCR positives were seropositive for IgG.

Characteristics of patients in the study population 2 by test result are
shown in table 1.
Positive cases were more likely to have had close contact with other
positive cases, and to have been admitted to an ED or hospitalized.
Individuals with a positive antibody positive test were more likely to
have had symptoms in the last two months than individuals with a
negative antibody test (88.11 vs 81.03%, p=0.019). Mean number of
symptoms was higher in individuals with positive antibody test than
in individuals with negative antibody test (4.50 vs 3.32, p<0.001).
The most frequent symptoms in both groups were cough, tiredness,
headache and fever.
Individuals with antibody positive test were more likely to have
tiredness, cough, fever, ageusia, anosmia, and headache (figure 2),
with some differences between males and females.
Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
the odds ratio (OR) for a positive test was significantly increased in
patients who had fever (>38º C), ageusia and contact with a positive
patient, tiredness (only men), anosmia (only in women), and
decreased in patients suffering from headache (in men), sore throat
(in women), and shaking chills (in women).

Most of the cases of COVID-19 infection are likely to be attended and
managed in primary care. Therefore, effective management of
COVID-19 pandemic from a primary care perspective requires
estimation of the seroprevalence in a specific community area, as well
as registration and follow-up of suspected or confirmed cases.
Several studies of seroprevalence have been published with varying
results.
A study carried out in Santa Clara, California, in 3.330 individuals,
weighting for population demographics, reported an antibody
prevalence of 2.8 % (95CI 1.3-4.7%) (4).
A study conducted in Germany, among 919 individuals with evaluable
infection status, 15.5% (95% CI: [12.3%; 19.0%]) were infected
(5).
Researchers from Geneva, Switzerland studying a population of 1.335
individuals, observed in the first week, a seroprevalence of 3.1%
(95% CI 0.2-5.99, n=343), 6.1% (95% CI 2.69.33, n=416) in the
second week, and 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-13.11, n=576) in the third
week (6).
In a total sample of tested company employees living in the SplitDalmatia and Šibenik-Knin County (Croatia) antibodies were detected
in 1.27% of participants (95% CI 0.77–1.98%)(7).
A study conducted on a general population sample of the island of
Jersey, UK, included a total of 855 participants, showed a
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of 3.1% (95% CI, 1.8–
4.4%) (8).
A study conducted in Gangelt county (N = 12 529) in Germany,
comprising a sample of 1000 participants showed that 15% of the
population developed antibodies to the virus [9].
Each study diﬀers in methods used and in its sampling strategy, thus
the results are not straightforward comparable.
While the results of our study are not representative for other parts
of the city, they have important implications for the implementation
of preventive measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
Recent results from a country-wide seroprevalence study of nearly
70.000 participants in Spain, using antibody blood tests, has showed
that only 5% of the population have been infected with the
coronavirus (10). This result is in line with the prevalence observed in
our study performed at a local level which is far below the rate that
would provide the population with the so-called herd immunity, which
experts place at 60% at the very least.

With regard to the frequency of symptoms we observed in our study
that anosmia and ageusia are the fourth and the fifth more frequent
symptoms in infected patients. Results from the logistic regression
analysis showed that fever (>38oC), anosmia, ageusia and contact
with a positive patient were risk factors associated with a positive test
result. A multi-center cross-sectional cohort study in primary care
patients in Germany, also showed that patients who reported
anosmia had a 4-fold increase for a positive test result (OR= 4.54,
95% CI, 1.51-13.67) (11).
In a recent study done in 2153 consecutive ambulatory and
hospitalized patients with positive results on reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing at 18 European hospitals
found that a total of 1754 patients (87%) reported loss of smell,
whereas 1136 (56%) reported taste dysfunction (12). The results of
this study highlight the importance of considering loss of smell and
taste in the diagnosis of mild to moderate COVID-19.
One of the limitations of our study is that characteristics of serological
immunoassay tests may not be sufficiently explored and validated
[13]. We did not perform RT-PCR to the IgM positive cases, thus we
could not confirm if these individuals were infected. The WHO stated
that serological tests, could be susceptible to cross-reaction with
other frequent infections, like human coronaviruses causing common
cold [14]. Nonetheless, despite their limitations, serology testing for
COVID-19 are useful to better quantify the number of cases of
COVID-19, including those that may be asymptomatic or have
recovered (13).
Conclusions
The seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 among
asymptomatic individuals in the general population was 5.47%, which
was lower than expected.
Approximately 40% of the symptomatic patients followed by GPs
during the peak months of the pandemic in Barcelona, were positive
for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Thirty percent of symptomatic
patients attended the ED, 13% were hospitalized and about 2% died.
Fever (>38oC), anosmia, ageusia and contact with a patient
diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with a positive test result.
