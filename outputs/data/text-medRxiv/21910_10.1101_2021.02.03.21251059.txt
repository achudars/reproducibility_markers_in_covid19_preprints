Abstract
Background: In the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated
questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine
among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt,
and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.
Methods: The 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual coauthors, and then subsequently translated back into English. After reconciling
translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated

into four

randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and
Saudi Arabia ). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged ≥18 years) were included in
the final analysis. Convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor
analyses were carried out. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha.
Results: Age of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females,
37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, and 30% were healthcare workers. The 5 subscales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach alpha

≥0.7). Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-total
correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation
matrix (<0.7). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire
could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the
hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate
psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA=0.060,GFI=0.924,
CFI=0.957, TLI=0.937, SRMR=0.076 & NFI=906).
Conclusion: the Arabic version of the 5C scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess the
psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among Arab population.

Introduction:
The world is currently in a public health crisis facing a fierce virus, the Coronavirus
(COVID-19), which puts the world in a pandemic. COVID-19 spreads rapidly around the
globe, affecting more than one hundred million with a toll of death exceeding two million
within one year [1].
All the countries around the world are fighting the spread of COVID-19.
Procedures that countries have taken include enforcing quarantines, lockdowns, social
distancing, wearing facemasks, and travel restrictions. These procedures have
impacted people both physically and psychosocially and have massively left negative
impacts on the global economy. “The multi-faceted catastrophic consequences
associated with the COVID-19 outbreak have intensified international efforts in
developing an effective prevention method to keep outbreaks under control” [2].
A combined effort is being simultaneously exerted by the World Health
Organization (WHO), governments, academic community, and pharmaceutical
industries to develop and deploy safe and effective vaccines. To this date, more than
100 vaccines are in a pre-clinical development phase, with at least 50 vaccines selected
to reach the clinical development stage [3]. On 31 December 2020, the WHO listed
mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) for emergency use [4].
The production of an effective vaccine against COVID-19 virus faces several challenges
such as selecting a proper formulation, reviewing and approving a large number of
potential vaccine candidates, massively producing the vaccine , and surveilling
it in the post-marketing stage, in addition to the cost issues and logistics of distribution
[5-7]. Nevertheless, a major obstacle towards achieving appropriate vaccination and
reaching an eventual herd immunity can be vaccine hesitancy among the general
public. Newly emerging vaccines are usually questioned by community members and
the views on receiving them can vary dramatically between individuals [8].

Vaccine Hesitancy (VH) refers to postponing or refusing to accept vaccination despite
its availability [9]. It is a complex situation that varies across time, place and type of the
vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy has become a major obstacle in the face of the preventive
strategies and procedures that aim to fight the spread of infectious diseases and is

predicted to slow the fight against the prospective COVID-19 vaccines [10]. In addition,
solely depending on the vaccination can lead into an un-favorite outcome if other
protection strategies are neglected [11].

There is a significant difference in vaccine acceptance. In a global survey conducted by
Lazarus V et al [12] ; 71.5% responded that they would accept and take the vaccine in
case it were proven safe and effective, and 48.1% said that they would get vaccinated if
their employer suggested it. Moreover, a worldwide systematic review on COVID-19
vaccine acceptance showed that the highest acceptance rates of COVID-19 vaccination
were found in Ecuador (97.0%), Malaysia (94.3%), Indonesia (93.3%) and China
(91.3%), respectively. On the opposite side, the lowest acceptance rates of COVID-19
vaccination were found in Kuwait (23.6%), Jordan (28.4%), Italy (53.7), Russia (54.9%),
Poland (56.3%), US (56.9%), and France (58.9%), respectively[13].
Several questionnaires were developed to assess the vaccine acceptance and
hesitancy, as Vaccine Confidence Scale [14], Parent Attitudes about Childhood
Vaccines Survey [15], Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS) [16], Global Vaccine Confidence
Index [17] , and the 5C scale [18].
The 5C scale extends “the scope of available measures and covers the broader
theoretical conceptualization of vaccine hesitancy and acceptance” [2]. It measures the
five psychological antecedents or determinants within the individual that is related to
whether or not he/she vaccinates. In addition, “it provides insights into the individual
mental representations, attitudinal and behavioural tendencies that are a result of the
environment and context the respondent lives in” [19]. These five antecedents are
confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility [19].

In the Arab region, two studies were conducted to assess the COVID-19 vaccine
hesitancy [20, 21]. Both studies did not report using an Arabic validated questionnaire.
This study, hence, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the long form of the
5C questionnaire into the Arabic language.

Methods
The study tool:
The 5C scale is composed of five sub-scales assessing the different psychological
antecedents of vaccination [19]. It includes:
a) Confidence: is defined as “trust in (i) the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, (ii)
the system that delivers them, including the reliability and competence of the
health services and health professionals, and (iii) the motivations of policymakers who decide on the need of vaccines” [9].
•

I am completely confident that vaccines are safe’’Q1’’.

•

Vaccinations are effective ‘’Q2’’.

•

Regarding vaccines, I am confident that public authorities decide in the
best interest of the community ‘’Q3’’.

b) Complacency: “exists where perceived risks of vaccine-preventable diseases are
low and vaccination is not deemed a necessary preventive action” [9].
•

Vaccination is unnecessary because vaccine-preventable diseases are
not common anymore’’Q4’’.

•

My immune system is so strong, it also protects me against diseases
‘’Q5’’.

•

Vaccine-preventable diseases are not so severe that I should get
vaccinated’’Q6’’.

c) Constraints: are an issue when “physical availability, affordability and willingnessto-pay, geographical accessibility, ability to understand (language and health
literacy) and appeal of immunization service affect uptake” [9].
•

Everyday stress prevents me from getting vaccinated ‘’Q7’’.

•

For me, it is inconvenient to receive vaccinations’’Q8’’.

•

Visiting the doctor's makes me feel uncomfortable; this keeps me from
getting vaccinated’’Q9’’.

d) Calculation: refers to individuals’ engagement in extensive information searching.
It is related to perceived vaccination and disease risks [22].
•

When I think about getting vaccinated, I weigh benefits and risks to make
the best decision possible ‘’Q10’’.

•

For each and every vaccination, I closely consider whether it is useful for
me ‘’Q11’’.

•

It is important for me to fully understand the topic of vaccination, before I
get vaccinated ‘’Q12’’.

e) Collective responsibility: it is the willingness to protect others by one’s own
vaccination by means of herd immunity [23].
•

When everyone is vaccinated, I don’t have to get vaccinated, too ‘’Q13’’.

•

I get vaccinated because I can also protect people with a weaker immune
system ‘’Q14’’.

•

Vaccination is a collective action to prevent the spread of diseases ‘’Q15’’.

All items were rated on 7-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = moderately
disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neutral, 5 = slightly agree, 6 = moderately agree,
and 7 = strongly agree).
Score interpretation
Because a general term that contains all antecedents does not exist, it is not
theoretically acceptable to calculate a total score for all antecedents. Using the 5C scale
does not lead to a total score providing a sample’s absolute state of hesitancy. It, rather,
allows for a valid assessment of determinants and predicts vaccination. It, therefore,
allows intervention design informed by monitoring and evidence practices [19, 24].
Translation and adaptation
We forward-translated the 5C scale into Arabic by two independent bilingual coauthors (AA & NE). Both co-authors rated the difficulty of translating each item and the
associated response choices. One bilingual researcher (RS) and another Arabic
translator compared the two translations and reconciled the discrepancies. Then, the
questionnaire was back translated into English by two additional co-authors (MY & RE).
The back translators compared their translations with the previous English version.
Minor discrepancies were identified and resolved by discussions between the
researchers.
Content validity and expert evaluation

The next step in the validation process was to assess the content validity with an
expert panel of 10 investigators (methodologist, healthcare professionals, public health
professional, and language professionals). The expert panel examined whether the
agreed-on translation covers the concepts as defined.
Cognitive interviews
We next performed cognitive testing of the Pre-final version. Trained members of
the research team conduced cognitive interviews among 20 participants of the intended
respondents (5 from each included country) to evaluate participant understanding,
readability, language, wording, and cultural appropriateness of items as well as the
clarity of the instructions for providing responses for each section.
During this step, we encountered some difficulties with explaining some points.
The first comment was related to the seven points Likert scale, particularly the
difference between strongly agree/disagree and moderately agree/disagree. In the
Arabic language, there is no sharp demarcation between the perceived meaning of
strongly and moderately. Another item, which was not well understood by the
participants, is the “Everyday stress prevents me from getting vaccinated”, there was a
confusion regarding the real perspective of the daily stress will hinder them from taking
the vaccine. Some participants felt that there was a repetition of the questions
“Vaccination is unnecessary because vaccine-preventable diseases are not common
anymore” and “Vaccine-preventable diseases are not so severe that I should get
vaccinated”. We reformulated the Arabic questions to deliver the construct beyond each
item of the original copy of the questionnaire. Then, the final Arabic version was
approved by the researchers and ready for field testing.
Data set for testing the validity of the Arabic version of 5C scale.
Based on the sample size recommendations of having 10 participants respond to each
item for validating a questionnaire (ratio 10:1), we needed 150 participants [25].
Moreover, a priori sample size calculation for Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)
technique to perform confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that a minimum sample
of 200 is required to run CFA [26]. For that, the minimum required sample size for our

analysis was 350 participants. Adult (18 years and above) Arabic speaking population is
included in the study.
The final Arabic copy of 5C scale was uploaded on Qualtrics and disseminated
online via different social media platforms (Facebook, WhatsApp, emails, and Twitter) to
673 participants. The sample was recruited from four randomly selected Arabic
countries (Egypt, Saudi Arabia. Libya, and United Arab of Emirates (UAE)). A total of
511 responded to the questionnaire, 89 participants chose not to complete the
questionnaire. The response rate was 62.70% (422/673). Of the 422 who completed the
questionnaire, we excluded 72 responses from the final analysis due to incomplete or
inconsistent data. The final sample size included in our analysis was 350 participants.
Data management and psychometric analysis
Quantitative data are summarized as mean ± standard deviation (SD) while qualitative
data are presented with percent and frequency. Total scores of each sub-scale were
calculated by addition of the scores of all items within each sub-scale. Pearson’s
correlation analysis was used to calculate inter-item and item- to- total.
Reliability and Item Analysis: Cronbach’s alphas were calculated for the sub-scales of
the questionnaire to assess its internal consistency. As a rule of thumb, a Cronbach’s
alpha of 0.70 to 0.80 is considered respectable for a scale for research use and an
alpha more than 0.80 is considered very good [27].
Construct Validity: it represents the “extent to which an instrument assesses a
construct of concern, and is associated with evidence that measures other constructs in
that domain and measures specific real-world criteria” [28]. It is determined using
content, criterion-related validity, and structural or factorial validity [28].
Criterion-related validity: both convergent and discriminant (divergent) validity were
used as indicators of criterion-related validity. Convergent validity was assessed by
analyzing inter-item and item-to-total correlation. Discriminant validity was assessed by
calculating factor correlation matrix of the five subscales[29].
Factorial analysis validity: We analyzed data collected from 350 participants. Factor
analysis was performed in two steps: exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (EFA
and CFA). We randomly divided the participants into two groups; 150 participants for
EFA and 200 participants for CFA.

Exploratory Factor analysis
The EFA aimed at identifying the major factor structures for the set of 15 items and to
determine the number of latent factors, without making assumptions about the factor
relationships [30]. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) sampling adequacy measure and
Bartlett’s sphericity test were performed before EFA. The KMO statistics range from 0 to
1, with values closer to 1 denoting greater adequacy of the factor analysis (KMO ≥ 0.6
low adequacy, KMO ≥ 0.7 medium adequacy, KMO ≥ 0.8 high adequacy, KMO ≥ 0.9
very high adequacy) and P value of Bartlett’s test is < 0.05, then factorial analysis can
be used [31]. The number of factors extracted is based on Eigenvalues (>1), scree plot,
parallel analysis, and interpretability of the factors [32].
To determine the type of rotation, we first ran EFA using the principal component
analysis with the an oblique direct Oblimin rotation to calculate the inter-factor
correlation. Discriminant validity was assessed if inter-factors correlation based on the
factor correlation matrix is less than 0.7 [33].
The final EFA was done using the principal component analysis with the
orthogonal Varimax rotation. A factor loading cut-off value of 0.50 was chosen to decide
which items were highly associated with a given factor[32]. In interpreting the output,
we defined that each factor should have at least 3 items with high factor loadings of 0.5
and higher on the primary factor and minimal cross-loadings on any of the other factors
(a < 0.35) to reduce the overlap between the sub-scales [32, 34].
Confirmatory factor analysis
The CFA that was performed based on the selected 200 participants aimed to measure
how well the factor structure, identified in the EFA, fits the observed data. Specifically,
we assessed the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs and model fit
measures using the SEM technique [35]. We used the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA <0.08), comparative fit index (CFI >0.9), Tucker Lewis index
(TLI>0.9), standardized root means square residual (SRMR ≤0.08), normal fit index
(NFI>0.9), goodness of fit (GFI>0.9)

as model fit indicators, and χ2/df <3 [36].

Convergent validity was determined if the average variance extracted (AVE) values of
the different factors were above 0.5. Discriminant validity was confirmed if the square
root of AVE is higher than the inter-correlation between the factors[37]. Moreover, we

assessed the construct reliability of each latent factor and reliability ≥0.7 indicates good
reliability [37]. We used statistical package of social science SPSS (version 25,
Chicago, USA) and SPSS AMOS 26 to run all the analyses.
Ethical considerations
The study was approved by the

Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine-

Alexandria University, Egypt (IRB No:00012098) following the International Ethical
Guidelines for Epidemiological studies [38].
RESULT
Characteristics of the study participants
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population. Age ranged
between 18 to 73 years; mean age of 34 ± 12 years. More than half were females
(57.14%), 37.43% were from Egypt, and 36.86 were from UAE. One-third were
healthcare workers and one-half (51.14%) were university graduates. Only 16.29%
reported a previous history of COVID-19 infection, 38.57% gave a family history of
death due to the infection, and 79.42 % reported knowing about the several types of
vaccines.
Questionnaire validation
We ran univariate item analysis using collected data from 150 participants. All items
means ranged from a minimum of 2.17 to a maximum of 6.14, and SD ranged from 1.25
to 1.94. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the different items of the
questionnaire (Table 2).
Reliability analysis: all sub-scales had a satisfactory internal consistency. Both
‘’Confidence’’ and ‘’Collective responsibility’’ sub-scales have Cronbach’s alpha of
0.829.‘’ “Constraints’’ sub-scale had the lowest Cronbach’s alpha (0.701). (Table 2)
Convergent validity: inter-item correlation for each sub-scale was highly significant
(P<0.001) (Table 1 supplementary). In addition, item-total correlation was significant.
(Table 2)

Exploratory factorial analysis:
Before conducting the EFA, we assessed the sampling adequacy and sphericity
assumptions. KMO measure of sampling adequacy was 0.80, which is above the
recommended value of 0.60, and Bartlett’s test of sphericity was found to be highly
significant (P < 0.001). Moreover, all the communalities demonstrated to be 0.5 or more.
Using these previously mentioned indicators, we conducted an EFA; at first, we ran the
analysis in the form of principal component analysis with an oblique direct Oblimin
rotation to assess the factor correlation matrix and check the discriminant validity. There
were both negative and positive correlations among the five factors. The largest
negative correlation was between Complacency and Constraints (-0.276), while the
smallest negative correlation was between Complacency and Calculation (-0.074). The
largest positive correlation was between Confidence and Constraints (0.300), while the
lowest positive correlation was between Calculation and Collective responsibility
(0.033). There were no correlation coefficients larger than 0.7; hence, the factors
derived from EFA revealed adequate discriminant validity (See details in Table 3).
The final analysis took the form of the principal component analysis with Varimax
rotation. The initial Eigenvalues showed that all 15 items of the questionnaire explained
72.8% of the variance in 5 factors. Table 4 shows the factor loadings for all items of the
questionnaire. For “Confidence sub-scale,” the items were loaded on one factor with
loading ranges from 0.782 to 0.868. For the “Complacency sub-scale,” all items were
loaded on one factor with factor loading ranges from 0.736 to 0.793. For “Constraints
sub-scale,” items loaded on one factor, with loadings from 0.606 to 0.861. For
“Calculation sub-scale,” the items loaded on one factor, with loadings between 0.726
to 0.863. Lastly, for “Collective responsibility,” all items loaded on one factor with
factor ladings ranges between 0.478 to 0.808.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis
To determine whether EFA proposed five-factor model with the 15-item questionnaire
can be used as a valid tool towards assessment of the psychological antecedents of
COVID-19 vaccines among the Arab population, we conducted a CFA using a different
sample of 200 participants.
We ran the CFA on the 15 items. We described the results of the CFA final
model with the SEM shown in Figure 1. All the loadings were from 0.41 to 0.94. The
construct reliability of the five factors in the CFA final model were above 0.7. For
convergent validity, the average variance extracted (AVE) values of confidence,
complacency and calculations factors were above 0.5. Although the AVE value of
constraints and collective responsibility factors were less than 0.5, the factors
specific items loadings were acceptable for convergent validity since there were no
items with loading below 0.4. The correlation between the five latent variables was less
than squared root of AVE, hence no problem with discriminant validity.
An overview of goodness-of-fit measures for the final model is shown in table 5. The
results demonstrate good model-data-fit, i.e., RMSEA <0.08, GFI, NFI, CFI, and TLI
>0.9, and SRMR<0.08. Hence, the 15-item questionnaire has good psychometric
properties and model fit to observed data.

Discussion
This study reports the results of the validation of the Arabic version of the 5C scale for
assessment of the psychological antecedents for COVID-19 vaccines. The study
sample was randomly recruited from four Arab countries Egypt, Libya, UAE, and Saudi
Arabia.
Differences between regions, populations, and cultures require reliability and validity
assessment of measurement instruments [39]. In the Arab countries, this is the first
validation study of the 5C questionnaire to assess the COVID-19 vaccine antecedents.
Arabic-speaking countries share similar culture and language. Although different
dialects are used, formal Arabic is the official language regardless the geographical
location. Therefore, chosen countries in this study are good representative of the Arab
region.
Psychometric test results were close to the values of the corresponding items in the
original German questionnaire [19]. Lower value of Cronbach’s alpha was obtained from
constraints sub-scale (0.70) compared to the original questionnaire (0.85). On the other
hand, the Arabic version of the questionnaire showed a higher Cronbach’s alpha (0.83)
for the collective responsibility sub-scale compared to the original questionnaire (0.71).
This may be explained by the different context in which we tested the 5C scale. While
the original questionnaire was tested before the era of COVID-19 pandemic, our
questionnaire was peculiarly validated for COVID-19 vaccines. The debates about the
different vaccines efficacy and safety affect the population acceptance. In addition, the
vaccines are not still available in all countries due to different polices regarding the

We did EFA to decide the number of factors needed to be extracted from the Arabic
version of the 5C scale. The resulting factors loadings provided that the five-factor
solution was the best for our data. This is consistent with what has been reported from
the factor analysis of the original version of the questionnaire[19].
We tested the EFA proposed five-factor model by CFA using different samples. The
results confirmed that the Arabic version of 5C scale constitutes five underlying

constructs, i.e., confidence, complacency, constraints, calculations, and collective
responsibility. These constructs can be measured with the 15-item questionnaire.
We assessed the convergent and discriminant validity of the Arabic version of the 5C
scale during CFA based on the AVE values [40]. In our study, convergent validity was
documented for all factors except for two latent factors (constraints and collective
responsibility) that had AVE values below 0.5; however, all factors loading were greater
than or equal to 0.4 and significant during CFA. Moreover, these items measured the
critical aspect of the different constraints and collective responsibility in the respective
domains. Hence, those factors were kept in the model. We also assessed the
discriminant validity by comparing the square root of AVE with inter-factor correlation.
Since square root of AVE was larger than the inter-factor correlation, the discriminant
validity issues were not possible for the Arabic version of the 5 C scale. Among the five
latent factors, the construct reliability was above the minimum acceptable level; which
indicates a good internal consistency of the questionnaire.
The 5C scale can adequately and accurately assess the psychological foundations of
vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. It is also indicative of the participants’ psychological
statuses. An individual who lacks confidence is less likely to have a positive attitude
and beliefs, less likely to trust the health system and medical treatments in general, and
tends to accept conspiracy theories or take them for granted. An individual who is tied to
constraints also tends to have a more general lack of self-control and self-efficacy.
Highly constrained individuals perceive a lack of time. Therefore, vaccination should be
made handy for them. A typical complacent person is not vulnerable; they feel healthy
and tend to not care about their health future, which might lead them to act in a high-risk
way. Disease risks are perceived low for this type of people. Conversely, people who
calculate risks prefer to deliberate and are usually concerned about the risks associated
with vaccination. Although deliberation and risk calculations are to consider, the
respective skills (numeracy) are not especially high in these people, which can lead to
skewed risk perceptions—i.e., high vaccination risks and low disease risks. “People who
score high on collective responsibility generally care more for other people and are

more empathic” [24]. Consequently, 5C scale is considered an optimal tool for different
determinants measurement of vaccine acceptance.
Based on the findings of this study, the Arabic version of the 5C scale is a valid and
reliable tool to assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among
Arabic speaking population.
