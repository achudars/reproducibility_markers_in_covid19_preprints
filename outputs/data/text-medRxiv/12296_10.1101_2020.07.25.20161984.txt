Abstract
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in China in December 2019.
Within a short period of time, the infectious disease has spread far and wide. This
study focuses on the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China—the original
epicenter of the outbreak. We show that the upper tail of COVID-19 cases in Chinese
cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent less than one, and
that a random proportionate growth model predicated by Gibrat’s law is a plausible
explanation for the emergence of the observed power law behavior. This finding is significant because it implies that COVID-19 cases in China is heavy-tailed and disperse,
that a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases, and that the
distribution has no finite mean or variance. The power-law distributedness has implications for effective planning and policy design as well as efficient use of government
resources.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first discovered in Wuhan region of China in
December 2019 (Zhu et al., 2020). The contagious disease quickly spread within China, despite unprecedented and aggressive containment measures, and crossed the borders reaching
every corner of the world within a short period of time, with the World Health Organization
(WHO) declaring COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 (Cucinotta
and Vanelli, 2020). This study focuses on the distribution and growth dynamics of COVID19 cases in China—the original epicenter of the outbreak. The presence of Chinese cities
with very large number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, the very wide dispersion in COVID19 cases across Chinese cities, and the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and
welfare make it crucial for researchers and policymakers to better understand COVID-19
distribution for effective planning and policy design as well as efficient use of government
resources.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the right tail of the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Chinese cities is well-characterized by a power law (Pareto) distribution,
meaning that the probability that a number of COVID-19 cases is more than x is roughly
proportional to x−γ , i.e., Prob(X > x) ∼ x−γ , where γ is the power law (Pareto) exponent.1
The estimated power law exponent is γ < 1, meaning the fitted power law distribution has
no finite moments, including mean and variance. The power law fit is robust to a range of
estimation methods and goodness-of-fit tests, and the distribution parsimoniously describes
the heavy tail of the data. Power law distributions are characterized by heavy tails, which
make the likelihood of extreme (upper-tail) events more typical. So, in case of COVID-19,
this implies an extremely large number of cases becomes more likely, which is actually true
for China, where few cities had extremely large number of cases (Han et al., 2020).
Power laws are extraordinarily ubiquitous in the social and natural sciences, having
been confirmed for the distributions of income and wealth (Pareto, 1896; Champernowne,
1953; Wold and Whittle, 1957; Singh and Maddala, 1976; Klass et al., 2006; Toda, 2012),
consumption (Toda, 2017; Toda and Walsh, 2015), firm size (Stanley et al., 1995; Axtell,

For a detailed review of power laws, see Reed (2001), Newman (2005), Sornette (2006) and Gabaix

(2009, 2016). The power law distribution with exponent γ ' 1 generates Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949).

1996; Gabaix, 1999; Ioannides and Overman, 2003; Devadoss et al., 2016), natural gas and
oil production (Balthrop, 2016), carbon dioxide (CO2 ) emissions (Akhundjanov et al., 2017),
frequency of words (Zipf, 1949; Irmay, 1997), among others. Our paper finds the existence
of a power law in epidemiology as well. The omnipresence of power laws is partly explained
by the fact they are preserved over an extensive array of mathematical transformations
(Gabaix, 2009).
An interesting aspect of power law distribution is that it is the macro-level steady-state
phenomenon that, in theory, can arise from a micro-level random proportionate growth
process, known as Gibrat’s law (Gibrat, 1931),2 whereby each unit’s (e.g., city’s) growth rate
is drawn randomly and independently of its current size.3 Given power law and Gibrat’s law
often go hand-in-hand, Gibrat’s law has also been extensively documented in the social and
natural sciences.4 The robust fit of power law to cross-sectional distribution of COVID-19
cases in Chinese cities potentially provides macro-level evidence for random proportionate
growth posited by Gibrat’s law. However, it is well known that power laws can similarly be
obtained from other models and systems (Barabási and Albert, 1999; Carlson and Doyle,
1999; Mitzenmacher, 2004; Newman, 2005; Gabaix, 2016). Therefore, we formally test for
random proportionate growth at micro-level by analyzing growth rates of COVID-19 cases
in Chinese cities. Our empirical analysis provides support for Gibrat’s law of proportionate
growth, which, in turn, offers a plausible explanation for the emergence of a power law
behavior in the data.

For a detailed review of Gibrat’s law, see Sutton (1997).
Gibrat’s law alone is not sufficient to give rise to a power law. In fact, it leads to the lognormal

distribution as shown by Gibrat (1931); though many examples used by Gibrat (1931) have recently been
shown to actually follow a Pareto-type distribution rather than the lognormal (Akhundjanov and Toda,
2020). Nonetheless, Gibrat’s law can generate a power law with an auxiliary assumption (Gabaix, 1999).
Section 4.1 elaborates on a link between Gibrat’s law and power law.

In particular, Gibrat’s law has been shown to explain the growth process of consumption (Battistin
et al., 2009), firms (Luttmer, 2007), farms (Clark et al., 1992), trucking industry (Balthrop, 2020), cities
(Ioannides and Overman, 2003; Eeckhout, 2004; González-Val, 2010; Luckstead and Devadoss, 2014), countries (Rose, 2006; González-Val and Sanso-Navarro, 2010), bird population (Keitt and Stanley, 1998), among
others.

There are a number of practical implications of the power law fit. First, given the estimated Pareto exponent is less than one (γ < 1), the distribution is heavy-tailed and so
disperse that observations near the mean account for little of the cumulative distribution
of COVID-19 cases. This implies talking about the average number of COVID-19 cases
is inconsequential as it no longer represents the majority of cases. In fact, even though
it is possible to compute sample mean and variance for the observed data, these moments
are generally non-convergent. In this case, quantile analysis or order statistics would be
more appropriate. Second, the heavy upper-tail of the distribution (also, the confirmation
of Gibrat’s law) is suggestive of concentration of COVID-19 cases in China, with the total
cases essentially determined by a few cities that bore the brunt of the outbreak, which is
true in case of China (Han et al., 2020). This has implications for more effective epidemiological planning and policy design as by focusing on and directing appropriate amount of
resources to those epicenters total cases of infection can be greatly slashed and the spread
of an outbreak potentially contained. Finally, on a more technical note, a heavy upper-tail
of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities has implications for empirical research. Specifically, it
shows that thin-tailed distributions (e.g., the normal) or moderately heavy-tailed distributions (e.g., the lognormal), which are often ‘go-to’ distributions in empirical research, are
inappropriate for COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities as such distributions dismiss extremely
large number of cases as an improbable observation. On the other hand, a power-law distribution is able to capture the heavy upper-tail of the data, which it does so parsimoniously,
outperforming a number of competing distributions.
The literature in this area is thin, but gradually forming. In the concurrent work, Beare
and Toda (2020), studying the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases for US counties,
find that the upper-tail of this distribution follows a power law, with Pareto exponent close
to 1. Similarly, Blasius (2020), examining the distribution of COVID-19 confirmed cases
and deaths for US counties, concludes that both distributions exhibit a power-law behavior.
Our paper contributes to this nascent line of literature by exploring the distribution as well
as underlying growth dynamics of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China—the origin of the
outbreak. A distinctive feature of our study is that COVID-19 cases in China affords us to
capture the entire life cycle of the pandemic (at least in its first wave): outbreak detection,

spread, peak, and decline to zero daily cases. In contrast, the analyses of Beare and Toda
(2020) and Blasius (2020) are based on data sets that were largely evolving at the time, as
both the United States of America and a whole host of other countries are still battling to
contain the spread of the virus to this date. Thus, the results of the above studies are likely
subject to change with newer data.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the data for
COVID-19 cases in China. Section 3 presents the methods and findings for power law
analysis. Section 4 provides the methods and results for Gibrat’s law analysis. Section 5
includes some concluding remarks.

Data

Daily data on the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Chinese cities comes
from Harvard Dataverse (China Data Lab, 2020). The dataset includes 339 cities in China
and covers periods between January 15, 2020, and May 23, 2020, which are determined by
the data source. Our main (power-law) analysis focuses on COVID-19 cases as of May 23,
2020, the latest data on cumulative cases, while an auxiliary analysis potentially explaining
the emergence of a power law behavior uses the data between January 15, 2020, and May
23, 2020. A power law analysis is data intensive, with Clauset et al. (2009) recommending
a minimum of 50 observations for reliable analysis. This condition is well-satisfied here,
including for the upper tail (see Section 3.3).
Figure 1 shows the evolution of empirical distribution of COVID-19 cases in Chinese
cities over select dates. It is apparent that the distribution has been right-skewed, with
heavier right tail, and it has been gradually sliding rightward, which reflects increasing
number of COVID-19 cases across Chinese cities over time.

cases for Chinese cities. We first present the methodology for power law analysis, followed
by estimation results.

(Pareto) distribution. The corresponding probability distribution function (PDF) is specified
as

where x is an outcome of X for x ∈ R+ , where R+ = {x ∈ R|x > 0}, xmin is the threshold

exponent, a parameter of interest. The mth non-central moment for the power law distribution is given by

Hence only the first bα − 1c moments exist for m < α − 1. Although higher-order moments
can be calculated for any finite sample, these estimates do not asymptotically converge to
any particular value. Given the sample x1 , . . . , xn , the joint log-likelihood function can be
written as

It is standard to report the counter-cumulative parameter γ = αM LE − 1, known as the
Hill estimator (Hill, 1975), instead of (4). The Hill estimator is obtained from (4), after a
small-sample adjustment, and takes the following form

The power-law fit to data is depicted by plotting the counter- (complimentary-) cumulative distribution function (CDF) on doubly logarithmic axes. The counter-CDF of a power

where k = xα−1
min is a constant. Taking the log of both sides of (8) yields a linear relationship
between log counter-cumulative probability (i.e., ln Prob(X > x)) and log data (i.e., ln x),
with the counter-cumulative parameter −γ being the slope of the line.
An alternative approach to estimate the counter-cumulative parameter γ is through a
regression-based technique. Specifically, estimate the following regression equation with
ordinary least squares (OLS)

ln(ranki ) = φ − γ OLS ln xi + εi ,

(9)

where ranki is observation i’s rank in the distribution, φ is the intercept term, γ OLS is the
parameter of interest, and εi is the idiosyncratic disturbance term. Equation 9 also shows
that a power law distributed process appears approximately linear on a log-log plot of ranki
against xi , with slope of −γ OLS . The asymptotic standard error for γ OLS is given by (Gabaix

An important consideration in power law analysis is the specification of the threshold
parameter xmin , beyond which power-law behavior takes hold. There are several approaches
proposed in the literature in this regard. For instance, one strand of literature suggests to
select xmin arbitrarily at either the 95% quantile of the data (Gabaix, 2009) or the point
where empirical PDF or CDF roughly straightens out on a log-log plot. Clearly, both of these
approaches are rather subjective and thus suffer from a certain degree of uncertainty about
whether they are able to capture the true starting point of power-law behavior. In fact,
Perline (2005), exploring the empirical consequences of this concern, shows that sufficiently
truncated Gumbel-type distributions (e.g., the lognormal) can also produce a linear pattern
on a log-log plot, hence imitating the power law distribution. Consequently, we adopt a
more systematic, data-driven procedure proposed by another strand of literature (Clauset
et al., 2009) to select xmin . This approach essentially treats each observation in the sample
as a potential candidate for xmin and selects the best candidate based on the minimization
of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit statistic, which is given by

KS = max |E(x) − F̂ (x)|,
x≥xmin

(11)

where E(x) is the empirical CDF and F̂ (x) is the estimated power-law CDF. The optimal
xmin minimizes the distance between the empirical CDF and the estimated power-law CDF.
The computational algorithm takes the following form:
Step 1: Set xmin = x1 ;
Step 2: Perform power-law parameter estimation using x ≥ xmin ;
Step 3: Compute the KS statistic in (11);
Step 4: Repeat steps 1-4 for all xi for i = 1, . . . , n;
Step 5: Select xmin with the lowest KS statistic.

3.2

The goodness of fit tests

Power-law analysis is accompanied by a series of diagnostic tests given significant parameter
estimates alone do not provide sufficient evidence in favor of power-law fit to data. In order
to guard against potential misspecification issues, one needs to conduct a goodness-of-fit
test and compare the power-law fit to data with those of alternative distributions.
Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) proposed ‘rank - 1/2’ test to verify the goodness-of-fit of
power law distribution. Let x∗ be defined as

x∗ =

Cov[(ln xi )2 , ln xi ]
.
2Var(ln xi )

(12)

Then, regress bias-adjusted log rank against the log data and a quadratic deviation term,
as in


1
ln ranki −
= φ + ζ ln xi + q(ln xi − x∗ )2 + εi .
2

(13)

The goodness-of-fit statistic is specified as q/ζ 2 . The null hypothesis of power-law distributedness is rejected if q/ζ 2 > 1.95(2n)−1/2 , where the latter term is the goodness-of-fit
threshold.
Further, Clauset et al. (2009) suggest comparisons of power-law fit with those of other,
competing, heavy-tailed distributions, such as the lognormal and exponential. Accordingly,
we fit these alternative distributions to the data by MLE and provide visual comparisons of
the distributions’ fits on a doubly logarithmic plot as detailed above. We also implement the
likelihood ratio test of Clauset et al. (2009) for a more formal comparison. The likelihood
ratio statistic is specified as
n h
i
X
R=
ln fˆ1 (xi ) − ln fˆ2 (xi ) ,

(14)

i=1

where fˆ1 (xi ) and fˆ2 (xi ) are the probabilities predicted by power law and an alternative
distribution, respectively. If the likelihood ratio statistic is positive, it indicates the power
law distribution fits the data more closely. If it is negative, then an alternative distribution

yields a better fit.5

3.3

Application

The methods discussed in Section 3 are applied to the cumulative number of COVID-19
confirmed cases in Chinese cities (x) as of May 23, 2020. The results from power law
analysis are provided in Tables 1-2 and Figure 2. As noted earlier, the requirement placed
on sample size for credible power law analysis is a minimum of 50 observations (Clauset
et al., 2009). This condition is well-satisfied here as the upper-tail sample (x > xmin )
contains 151 observations. The Hill and OLS estimates of the counter-cumulative parameter
γ are around 0.80 and highly statistically significant. Given m < 0.80, the moments of the
fitted power law distribution (including mean and variance) are generally non-convergent.
The goodness-of-fit test of Gabaix and Ibragimov (2011) suggests we fail to reject the null
hypothesis of power-law distributedness, which provides strong evidence in favor of power
law fit to COVID-19 cases in China.
Figure 2 depicts the power law and competing heavy-tailed distributions’ fits to the
data. It is apparent that the power law distribution generally fits the data better than
the rivals, particularly in the lower to mid quantiles of the upper tail, where the observed
data forms a distinct linear pattern. The power law slightly overestimates the frequency of
the largest cases in the extreme upper tail (after log confirmed cases of about 7.8), where
the distribution decays relatively slowly. Now, there are more flexible forms of the Pareto
distribution—often with an extra parameter and/or of mixture form—that allow the extreme
upper-tail probabilities of the distribution to decay more quickly, and they have repeatedly
been shown to improve upon the benchmark power law distribution in fitting empirical data
(see, for instance, Patel and Schoenberg, 2011). The main goal of the present study is to
examine whether a power law in general approximates COVID-19 cases in China, and not
the investigation of various (modified) distributions within the power law family.
The fits of competing distributions—the lognormal and exponential—noticeably deviate
from the empirical data throughout the domain. The likelihood ratio tests in Table 2 provide

formal evidence in this regard. As is evident from large positive likelihood ratio statistics,
the power law distribution significantly outperforms both the lognormal and exponential
distribution in fitting COVID-19 cases in China, which is in line with our observations from
Figure 2. We reject both the lognormal and exponential as an adequate specification for
COVID-19 cases. In summary, our estimation results and diagnostic tests provide strong
evidence that the COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities can be well characterized by the power
law (Pareto) distribution.

Gibrat’s law as a plausible explanation for power law behavior

In this section, we explore whether a growth model involving Gibrat’s law (Gibrat, 1931) can
potentially explain the emergence of the observed power-law behavior in COVID-19 cases in
China. We focus on Gibrat’s law specifically granted a random multiplicative growth (with
a caveat) is the prevalent attribute of models explaining the genesis of power laws (Gabaix,
1999, 2009).

4.1

A link between power law and Gibrat’s law

There are different mechanisms proposed in the literature, including the Yule process (Willis
and Yule, 1922; Yule, 1925) and random growth models with geometrically distributed age
distribution (Wold and Whittle, 1957; Reed, 2001; Toda, 2014; Beare and Toda, 2017), that
can generate power laws.6 In what follows, we describe a simple of such mechanisms.
Suppose Sit is the size of a stochastic process of interest for unit i at time t. For instance,
COVID-19 cases in city i up to day t. According to Gibrat’s law, the size of the process (at
least in the upper tail) exhibits random multiplicative growth, evolving as

Sit+1 = µit+1 Sit

(15)

over time, where µit+1 is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable
with an associated PDF of f (µ). Hence, random growth factor µit+1 = Sit+1 /Sit is independent of the current size Sit , which is commonly known as Gibrat’s law of proportionate

growth. Gibrat’s law alone does not generate power law but, instead, gives rise to the lognormal distribution for the size of the process (see Section 4.2 for details), which was noted
by Gibrat (1931) himself early on. Later, Gabaix (1999) showed that power law can arise
from Gibrat’s law with an additional assumption, a sketch of which we provide below.
Let Gt (s) = Prob(St > s) be the counter-CDF of St . Substituting (15) into the counterCDF, the equation of motion for Gt+1 (s) boils down to

distribution.

Testing for Gibrat’s law

For empirical purposes, we consider a continuous time representation of Gibrat’s law, given
by geometric Brownian motion

dSit = gSit dt + νSit dBit ,

(18)

where g is the expected growth rate, ν > 0 is the volatility, and Bit is a standard Brownian
motion that is i.i.d. across cross-sectional units. Applying Itô’s lemma to (18) yields

d ln Sit = (g − ν 2 /2)dt + νdBit ,

meaning the cross-sectional distribution of Sit , with the initial size of Si0 , is lognormal
ln(Sit /Si0 ) ∼ N [(g − ν 2 /2)t, ν 2 t].

(20)

Equation (19) (along with Proposition 1 in Gabaix (1999)) suggests that growth rates
under Gibrat’s law can be described by a random walk process of the form (Sutton, 1997;
Eeckhout, 2004; Gabaix, 2009)

ln Sit = ln Sit−1 + ζit .

(21)

Setting the random growth component ζit = φi +ξit , where φi is the effect of unit-wide factors
and ξit is an i.i.d. random effect, produces a random walk with drift. A standard method to
test for Gibrat’s law is through estimation of the following cross-sectional regression equation

ln Sit = φ + ρ ln Sit−1 + ξit .

(22)

In (22), ρ is the parameter of interest, with ρ ' 1 providing statistical evidence that the
growth process of St adheres to Gibrat’s law.
An alternative approach for testing for Gibrat’s law of proportionate growth is through
estimation of the cross-sectional regression equation of the form (Beare and Toda, 2020)

∆ ln Sit+1 = β0t + β1t ln Sit + β2t ∆ ln Sit + β3 Dit + eit ,

(23)

where ∆ is the difference operator, ∆ ln Sit+1 is the COVID-19 growth rate in city i between
day t and t + 1, ∆ ln Sit is the COVID-19 growth rate in city i between day t − 1 and t, Dit is
the number of days between day t and the day of the first COVID-19 case in city i, and eit is
an i.i.d. error term. The parameters of interest are β1t , β2t , β3t , with β1t ' 0, β2t ' 0, β3t ' 0
providing empirical evidence for the presence of Gibrat’s law. The distinctive feature of
equation (23) is the inclusion of age distribution—days since outbreak for each city—in
addition to the growth rate. Obtaining age distribution has traditionally been cumbersome
in power law analysis (e.g., of cities). Fortunately, our data conveniently affords us this

variable as we observe the entire timeline of the evolution of COVID-19 across Chinese
cities.

4.3

Application

We apply the methods discussed in Section 4.2 to each day between January 23, 2020, and
February 25, 2020 (inclusive). The reason for starting from January 23 is because at least
30 cities had a positive number of cumulative cases (Sit > 0) starting from January 23 (see
Figure 3). The reason for stopping at February 25 is because COVID-19 dynamics in China
had largely stabilized by February 25 (Sit+1 ' Sit ), with a small to zero number of new daily
cases after February 25, which left the distribution of cumulative cases after February 25
virtually unaffected (see Figure 1). This will also become apparent from our findings below.
Figure 4 shows the estimation results for ρt in equation (22) for t = Jan 23, . . . , Feb 25.
Clearly, the estimates of ρt are statistically indistinguishable from unity (ρt ' 1), which
confirms the random growth model predicated by Gibrat’s law. The 95% confidence interval shrinks moving left to right, which can be attributed to two factors. First, it reflects
increasing sample size (i.e., increasing number of cities with confirmed cases), at least until
February 8, when most Chinese cities had reported a positive number of cases (Figure 3).
Second, the thinning of the confidence interval can also be attributed to the stabilization of
COVID-19 situation in China, which saw a rapid decline in new daily cases starting from
mid-February, with the daily change (growth rate) approaching to zero.
Figure 5 reports the estimation results for β0t , β1t , β2t , β3t in equation (23) for t =
Jan 23, . . . , Feb 25. Panels (b)-(d) contain the estimates for β1t , β2t , β3t , which are of main
interest here. It is apparent that these estimates are largely equal to zero or close to zero
(β1t ' 0, β2t ' 0, β3t ' 0), which indicates the growth rate between days t and t + 1 does
not depend on the number of cases on day t, nor on the growth rate between days t − 1
and t, nor on the number of days since the first confirmed case. This also provides evidence
for the presence of Gibrat’s law for COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities. The estimates of β0t
in panel (a) show that the expected growth rate of confirmed cases declined over the study
period, with some fluctuations, and eventually approached to zero around February 9, which
is consistent with the observed data.

In light of the discussion in Section 4.1, the confirmation of Gibrat’s law for COVID19 cases in Chinese cities provides a plausible explanation for the emergence of power law
behavior shown for the data.

Conclusion

The dynamics of the novel coronavirus pandemic are complex and affected by a plethora
of factors, which are yet to be fully understood. In spite of the apparent chaotic evolution
of the pandemic, surprising regularities can still be observed in the size distribution and
growth process of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we examined the distribution of the novel
coronavirus cases in China—the original epicenter of the ongoing pandemic. We presented
empirical evidence for a power law distribution for the upper tail of the number of COVID-19
cases in Chinese cities. The power law fit is robust to different estimation methods, passes
rigorous diagnostic tests, and fits the data better than a number of rivaling distributions.
The implications of the power law fit are that the number of COVID-19 cases in Chinese
cities is heavy-tailed and disperse, so that average number of COVID-19 cases is problematic
to talk about; that COVID-19 cases are concentrated within a few cities that account for
a disproportionately large amount of infections; and that mean and variance are generally
not finite. Admittedly, there may always be a distribution that fits the data better than a
power law granted there are virtually an infinite number of distributions. What we showed
here is that the power law distribution is able to capture the upper tail of the data, which
it do so parsimoniously, and better than a couple ‘go-to’ distributions. In addition, given
that the data is not lognormally distributed, we reject Gibrat’s law of random proportionate
growth in its standard form. However, the nuanced version of Gibrat’s law (Gabaix, 1999),
as discussed in Section 4.1, is demonstrated to be a plausible mechanism for the emergence
of power law behavior in COVID-19 cases in China.
