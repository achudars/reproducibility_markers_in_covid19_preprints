Abstract
Objectives: As of the early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an
emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe.
Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received
chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated these
adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database.
Materials and Methods: We conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of
neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to
FAERS database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. Adjusted reporting
odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of
chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model.
Results: We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE
following the use of chloroquine. Exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant
high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95%
confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited.
There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide,
psychosis, confusion, and agitation.

Conclusion: Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use
of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be
informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global emergency situation [1], for which the
development of drugs and vaccines has been intensively investigated worldwide. In April 2020, the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [2] and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [3] have
approved the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for an emergency treatment of COVID-19,
based on their potential effectiveness in this setting [4, 5]

.

While chloroquine has a long history in the treatment of malaria and autoimmune diseases, its
safety and efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19 remain unknown [5]. In the treatment of malaria and
autoimmune diseases, chloroquine can cause numerous side effects such as nausea, headache, pruritus,
worsening of psoriasis, retinopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. While neuropsychiatric symptoms such as
seizure, coma, and psychosis, were also reported in patients who received chloroquine [6, 7], it is still
unknown which neuropsychiatric symptoms are directly associated with the use of chloroquine, partly
because of their relatively low frequency [8]. Understanding in advance the types of neuropsychiatric
symptoms that may occur in patients treated with chloroquine, may be useful, particularly in patients
with COVID-19 in intensive care units, where rapid clinical judgement is required.
In the current study, we investigated the link between the use of chloroquine and the occurrence
of neuropsychiatric symptoms, using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database that
is provided by the FDA [9]. Since this database contains a very large number of case reports of drug

surveillance of drug safety, [10], despite the risk of bias that is associated with its self-reported data [11].

Methods
Data acquisition and preprocessing
This was a retrospective pharmacovigilance study that used the FAERS database. This database contains
more than 9 million global case reports of potential adverse events of drugs. On April 1, 2020, we
downloaded from the FDA’s website (https://www.fda.gov) patient data that were reported between the
fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. The FAERS database contains data tables named
‘DEMO’, ‘DRUG’, ‘REAC’, ‘OUTC’, ‘RPSR’, ‘THER’, and ‘INDI’, of which we mainly used the
following 3 tables: 1) ‘DEMO’, which provides the case ID, sex, age, year of event occurrence, country
of event occurrence, and the reporter’s type of occupation (e.g., medical doctor, pharmacist, lawyer,
consumer); 2) ‘REAC’, which contains all adverse events that are potentially caused by the drug used by
each patient, and 3) ‘DRUG’, which includes the name, dose, indication, and date of administration and
discontinuation of each drug that is possibly associated with that AE. In the ‘DRUG’ table, the causality
assessment of the relationship between each drug and its reported AE is classified by the reporter as
‘primary suspected’, ‘secondary suspected’, ‘concomitant’, or ‘interacting’. In our analysis, we included
only reports that were classified as ‘primary suspected’ and ‘secondary suspected’, to reduce the risk of
false positive association in deriving our conclusions. In addition, we included only reports that were
reported from medical doctor, pharmacist, or other medical staffs, and not from lawyers or consumers.

Duplicate reports were excluded such that only the latest version of the report that was obtained from the
same case ID was retained.

Database search
In the FAERS database, the AEs are mainly identified by their Preferred Terms (PTs), as determined by
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). To search for cases that were associated
with chloroquine (including hydroxychloroquine) or mefloquine treatment and presented with any of the
AEs of interest, we used the following neurological or psychiatric AE terms, as summarized in
Supplemental Table 1: ‘Seizure’ (PT: 10039906), ‘Loss of consciousness’ (PT: 10024855), ‘Confusional
state’ (PT: 10010305), ‘Coma’ (PT: 10010071), ‘Stupor’ (PT: 10042264), ‘Somnolence’ (PT:
10041349), ‘Sedation’ (PT: 10039897), ‘Lethargy’ (PT: 10024264), ‘Delirium’ (PT: 10012218),
‘Disorientation’ (PT: 10013395), ‘Hallucination’ (PT: 10019063), ‘Delusion’ (PT: 10012239), ‘Paranoia’
(PT: 10033864), ‘Anxiety’ (PT: 10002855), ‘Anger’ (PT: 10002368), ‘Aggression’ (PT: 10001488),
‘Nervousness’ (PT: 10029216), ‘Irritability’ (PT: 10022998), ‘Mood altered’ (PT: 10027940),
‘Abnormal behavior’ (PT: 10061422), and ‘Restlessness’ (PT: 10038743). In addition, several AE terms
were similar, and were therefore treated collectively, based on a single AE category, as follows:
‘Dizziness’ (PT: 10013573) and ‘Dizziness postural’ (10013578) were treated as dizziness, ‘Amnesia’
(PT: 10001949) and ‘Anterograde amnesia’ (PT: 10002711) were treated as amnesia, ‘Altered state of

consciousness’ (PT: 10001854) and ‘Mental status changes’ (PT: 10048294) were treated as altered
mental status (AMS), ‘Acute psychosis’ (PT: 10001022) and ‘Psychotic disorder’ (PT: 10061290) were
treated as psychosis, ‘Agitation’ (PT: 10001497) and ‘Psychomotor hyperactivity’ (PT: 10037211) were
treated as agitation, ‘Depressed mood’ (PT: 10012374) and ‘Depression’ (PT: 10012378) were treated as
depression, ‘Panic attack’ (PT: 10033664) and ‘Panic reaction’ (PT: 10033670) were treated as panic,
‘Nightmare’ (10029412) and ‘Abnormal dreams’ (10000125) were treated as nightmare, and ‘Suicidal
ideation’ (PT: 10042458), ‘Completed suicide’ (PT: 10010144), ‘Suicide attempt’ (PT: 10042464), and
‘Suspected suicide’ (PT: 10082458) were treated suicide.
We included mefloquine as one of our drugs of interest because it is an antimalarial drug that is
known to cause neuropsychiatric AEs [12]. We classified each case report based on the following
binomial factors: ‘with’ or ‘without’ exposure to the drugs of interest, and ‘with’ or ’without’ the
development of each of the AEs of interest, irrespective of the timing of drug administration or the time
of AE development.

Statistical analyses
All data handling and statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 3.5.1). For each
included drug (chloroquine or mefloquine), we calculated the reporting odds ratio (ROR), to assess the
potential drug-AE links for chloroquine (or mefloquine) and the reported neuropsychiatric symptoms.

The crude ROR was calculated by a 2 × 2 contingency table as described previously [13-15], where all
the reports were classified by two factors for each AE term and for each drug, as described above. When
the lower limit of the 95% confidential interval (CI) for the adjusted ROR was > 1, the AE was
considered to be significantly highly reported following the use of the drug of interest, compared with
the report of the same AE following the use of all other drugs.
In calculating ROR, we used a multilevel model, to adjust for covariates in a hierarchical design,
as described previously [16, 17]: we incorporated into the model the year of AE occurrence and the
country of AE occurrence as random effect terms, to reduce bias in the data. Accordingly, the adjusted
ROR was calculated by the following formula [16]:

intercepts) are the calendar year between 1990 and 2019, and the regional code of the country (e.g., the
United States, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Japan). We used the R package lme4 [18] to perform the
above multilevel model analysis.

Results
In total, our analysis included 2,389,474 unique case reports. There were 4,336 case reports with
exposure to chloroquine, of which 520 (12.0%) reported neuropsychiatric AEs. The number of reported
cases with exposure to mefloquine was only 67, of which 28 (41.8%) included neuropsychiatric AEs.
Patients treated with chloroquine were predominantly female (3452 females (81.9%) versus 762 males)
and the median age of the patients was 56.0 (IQR: 45.0–65.0).
Patients treated with mefloquine were predominantly male (40 males (62.5%) versus 24 females) with a
median age of 40.0 (IQR: 27.0–72.0). There were no cases of concomitant exposure to chloroquine and
mefloquine.
Figure 1 provides forest plots of the adjusted RORs and the their 95% CI for each
neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine (Figure 1A) or mefloquine (Figure 1B). In the
case of chloroquine-associated AEs (Figure 1A), only 5 AE types, including loss of consciousness
(LOC) (adjusted ROR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66), amnesia (adjusted ROR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.02–1.66),
delirium (adjusted ROR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.06–2.34), hallucination (adjusted ROR, 2.12; 95% CI,
1.54–2.92), and depression (adjusted ROR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22–1.77) had significantly high reporting
(lower limit of the 95% CI > 1). As for mefloquine (Figure 1B), all of the neuropsychiatric AEs, except
for somnolence, showed high reporting, with adjusted ROR values higher that 2 in almost all cases.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated reports of neuropsychiatric AEs that were developed following exposure
to chloroquine as a treatment for malaria or autoimmune diseases. The major strength of our study is that
it was based on a database that includes global real-world data from a very large number of patients. Our
results showed a statistically significant association (albeit marginal) between the use of chloroquine and
the reporting of LOC, amnesia, delirium, hallucination, and depression, however, there was no
statistically significant association between the use of chloroquine and the reporting of suicide,
psychosis, confusion, or agitation, suggesting that there is no link between the use of chloroquine and
the increased risk of these AEs. Conversely, mefloquine showed to be associated with statistically
significant high reporting of most of the neuropsychiatric AEs, which is consistent with some of the
earlier literature reports [12, 19].
Our study has some limitations, resulting from the use of self-reported data [11], and it
therefore includes some bias that cannot be eliminated. First, this setting may be associated with a
reporting bias, that is, over- or under-reporting of neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine.
Second, due to the absence of denominators, we were not able to discuss the incidence rate of each
neuropsychiatric AE. Third, in our multivariate adjustment, we did not consider the use of concomitant
medications or the medical history of the patients, both of which could have potentially contributed to
the development or to the worsening of some neuropsychiatric symptoms. Fourth, while suicide was

included as one of the AEs in our analysis, it is possible that some of the suicide cases represent suicide
by chloroquine overdose, which is known to be cardiotoxic, and not an AE of chloroquine [6]. Fifth, we
have not included the timing or the total dose of chloroquine and mefloquine in the analysis. Lastly, it is
possible that our final dataset included duplicated cases that should have been excluded.
To conclude, the current pharmacovigilance study, using the FAERS database, did not suggest a
potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide or psychosis. These results
provide information that can be essential when the use of chloroquine is considered for the treatment of
patients with COVID-19. Since this study was based on a self-reporting database that inevitably contains
several biases, cohort studies are needed, to validate these results and to confirm the neuropsychiatric
safety of chloroquine.
