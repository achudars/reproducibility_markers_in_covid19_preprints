ABSTRACT
Background: Switzerland had one of the highest incidence of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Europe during the second wave.
Schools were open as in most of Europe with specific preventive measures in place.
However, the frequency and transmission of acute unrecognized, asymptomatic or
oligosymptomatic infections in schools during this time of high community transmission is
unknown. Thereof, our aim was to pilot a surveillance system that detects acute SARS-CoV2 infections in schools and possible transmission within classes.
Methods: 14 out of the randomly selected sample of the Ciao Corona cohort study
participated between December 1 and 11, a time when incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2
infections was high for the canton of Zurich. We determined point-prevalence of acute
SARS-CoV-2 infections of school children attending primary and secondary school. A buccal
swab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) to detect SARSCoV-2 were taken twice 1 week apart (T1 and T2) in a cohort of children from randomly

selected classes. A questionnaire assessed demographics and symptoms compatible with a
SARS-CoV-2 infection during the past 5 days.
Results: Out of 1299 invited children, 641 (49%) 6- to 16-year-old children and 66 teachers
from 14 schools and 67 classes participated in at least 1 of 2 testings. None of the teachers
but 1 child had a positive PCR at T1, corresponding to a point-prevalence in children of 0.2%
(95% CI 0.0% to 1.1%), and no positive PCR was detected at T2. The child with positive
PCR at T1 was negative on the RDT at T1 and both tests were negative at T2. There were 7
(0.6%) false positive RDTs in children and 2 (1.7%) false positive RDTs in teachers at T1 or
T2 among 5 schools (overall prevalence 0.7%). All 9 initially positive RDTs were negative in
a new buccal sample taken 2 hours to 2 days later, also confirmed by PCR. 35% of children
and 8% of teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days prior to testing.
Conclusion: In a setting of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, unrecognized virus
spread within schools was very low. Schools appear to be safe with the protective measures
in place (e.g., clearly symptomatic children have to stay at home, prompt contact tracing with
individual and class-level quarantine, and structured infection prevention measures in
school). Specificity of the RDT was within the lower boundary of performance and needs
further evaluation for its use in schools. Given the low point prevalence even in a setting of
very high incidence, a targeted test, track, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy for
symptomatic children and school personnel adapted to school settings is likely more suitable
approach than surveillance on entire classes and schools.

INTRODUCTION
The role of schools in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection and transmission is highly debated and ranges from “there is no evidence of
danger” [1] to “overlooked or at risk” [2, 3]. This pronounced contradiction has its roots in a
puzzle that has many missing pieces. Children are clinically much less severely affected than
adults if infected by SARS-CoV-2; 1% of those infected are hospitalized, 0.1% need
intensive care and <0.1% die [4]. An asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infection is present
in at least half of the children [5] which allows them to attend school despite undiscovered
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. As asymptomatic cases are so common among children, subtle
undiscovered spread may occur, especially in schools where groups of children gather,
interact and spend most of their daytime.
Population-based studies on acute infection and seroprevalence show that rates of
infection with SARS-CoV-2 in children are similar to those in adults [6-8]. School outbreaks
have been described [2], but it is not clear how frequently they occur and how much they
contribute to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on a population level. Retrospective modelling
studies based on many assumptions are highly controversial [1, 3, 9, 10]. Some groups have
shown that closing schools and universities without making a distinction between these
different settings, was associated with a 38% reduction of the reproduction factor R during
the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [3]. Others documented that school closures alone
prevented only 2-4% of deaths [1]. Irrespective of outcomes on morbidity and mortality rates
on the population level, school closures come with an enormous burden of social, educational
and psychological constraints to millions of children worldwide, and especially to those that
need the school system most to be carried and supported by society [11]. Other less
disruptive, potentially effective approaches of infection prevention measures can be taken up
by schools before a hard lock-down is considered. For example in Switzerland, parents are

asked to keep their children at home when sick, each school needs to have protective
measures in place to prevent transmissions and specific regulations of authorities are in place.
Unfortunately, their impact has been poorly studied [12, 13].
Surveillance of infections in school children may help to better understand the
situation in schools, evaluate and adjust protective measures and trigger test, track, isolate
and quarantine (TTIQ). Some surveillance studies used antibody tests to determine
seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children [14-16] with few of these studies specifically
focusing on the school setting [17]. We recently reported about the protocol and results of the
large, population and school-based study Ciao Corona [8, 18, 19]. These epidemiological,
serological studies are very valuable to determine seroprevalence and its regional variability,
predictors of seropositivity as well as the extent to which clustering of cases occurs within
classes and schools over time. But several additional questions cannot be addressed. For
example, the number of children in schools with acute unrecognized, asymptomatic SARSCoV-2 infections and to what extent these children transmit the virus in the school setting is
unclear and can only be elucidated using viral testing as done in several outbreak case studies
but very few school-based studies [20, 21]. Also, it is unclear how surveillance of such acute
but almost silent infections can be linked to TTIQ in order to breaking transmission chains.
Surveillance for acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in school settings can be implemented
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) [22]. PCR has the
advantage of being highly sensitive and detect infections in asymptomatic persons. On the
other side, PCR tests take time to deliver results. Potentially infectious school children may
transmit the virus until the result is available since sending them into quarantine until the test
results are available is not an option in a surveillance setting like for symptomatic persons.
Also, a substantial proportion of infected persons still show positive PCR tests while not
being infectious anymore. This carries the risk of unnecessary TTIQ [23]. This latter

potential problem of PCR tests may be smaller for RDT because they are less sensitive [22]
and would allow triggering immediate TTIQ when the test is positive.
The aim of this study was threefold. Firstly, to determine the point prevalence of
asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic acute SARS-CoV-2 infections in school children during a
time of high community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Secondly, to evaluate the
feasibility of a surveillance system to monitor acute SARS-CoV-2 infections and clustering
in schools. Thirdly, to find out whether a RDT can be used in school in children and their
classroom teachers that are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to differentiate between the
infectious and postinfectious PCR-positive state and how PCR and RDT may be linked to
TTIQ in school settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This observational prospective study was nested in the Ciao Corona cohort study and
took part from December 1 to December 11, 2020 at a time of high community transmission
of the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Switzerland is one of the most affected
countries worldwide with 4-5000 per 100’000 new cases per day, 300 per 100’000 in the age
range 10 to 19 years [24]. The study protocol and related documents were approved by the
cantonal ethical committee of Canton Zurich (BASEC Nr. 2020-01336). All parents and
teachers gave written and children verbal consent to participate. We invited 15 out of 55
schools from the Ciao Corona study, a population-based study with randomly selected
schools looking at seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clustering longitudinally in
the canton of Zurich [8, 18, 19]. Invited schools were selected based on high incidence areas
comprising the city of Zurich and one school of each of 4 adjacent districts to reach 600-800
children from primary and secondary schools. Herein, we use the term children for both

primary and secondary school children and adolescents. Teachers could participate if they
taught selected classes for at least 8 hours/week and a minimum of 2 days per week.
In each school, two testing days (T1 and T2) were done 1 week apart. Each time, two
parallel buccal swabs were collected from children and teachers, 1 for the RDT
(STANDARD Q® COVID-19 Ag Test from Biosensor/Roche) and 1 for the PCR (Analytica,
Zurich, Switzerland). SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed using the CE-IVD-marked
AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Seegene Inc, Seoul, Republic of Korea) to detect the N-, S-,
RdRP- and E-gene on a CFX96TM Real-time PCR System (Extraction-free method) [25] and
was used as reference standard. PCR was done on buccal instead of a naso-pharyngeal swab.
The agreement between PCR and RDTs using buccal swabs during acute SARS-CoV-2
infection has been validated in an adult symptomatic sample of 928 patients [26]. In this
validation study, detection of acute infection was 39.8 and 40.1% for PCR on a buccal and
naso-pharyngeal swab, respectively. Diagnostic performance of both PCRs was equivalent
with reciprocal sensitivities of 95.7 and 96.5%. Sensitivities of the RDT compared to nasopharyngeal PCR was 92.9% (86.4-96.9%), specificity was 100% (99.3-100%).
Children and teachers were instructed not to eat and drink for 1 hour prior to testing.
The buccal swabs were taken in a large room where participants could be at least 2 m apart.
Swabs were taken with closed mouth over 1 min. Two swabs were held closely together so
that they were exposed to the same location of the enoral space. Swabbing of the mucosal
membrane was done in the whole enoral space with some pressure application to make sure
to have some cells contained in the swab. One swab was then used for the PCR and one for
the RDT test. The RDT was performed directly in the schools and were read at 15-20 min
and judged by two study team members in agreement as positive or negative. Each RDT
biosensor was then photographed and the pictures saved on a secure university server. All
positive RDT tests were repeated using a new buccal swab 2 hours to 2 days later (for four

participants, also with the same buccal swab immediately when the signal was borderline
positive to confirm). The two hours repeat was established after the first positive test
experience. Acute symptoms during the last 5 days in children were assessed by staff
members during testing prior to the swabs.
It was planned to inform parents and the school principals in case of positive RDTs in
order to start TTIQ. After 3 false positive RDTs on the first day of testing, we changed
procedures and required a confirmation by a repeated positive RDT and/or PCR test before
initiating the isolation and quarantine measures by contact tracing teams.
The target sample size was calculated based on a number of assumptions: given that
the population of 0-9 and 10-19 year-olds in the canton of Zürich is 161’613 and 141’482
respectively, weekly incidence of PCR diagnosed cases in 44th week of 2020 was 80 in 0-9
year-old children and 692 in 10-19 year old adolescents, assuming that only 1 in 10 cases is
diagnosed with PCR (as the ratio of tested children has seemingly increased substantially
since spring 2020) [8], assuming that an asymptomatic infected child is PCR positive for 7
days, that 30% of undiagnosed cases are quarantined and do not attend school, we expected 1
PCR positive case in 308 children 0-9 years old and 1 in 32 children 10-19 year-old.
Therefore, in order to test the feasibility of the surveillance and maximize the probability of
detecting positive cases, we oversampled secondary schools. 5 primary and 9 secondary
schools were invited. Due to the character of the study, highly uncertain assumptions, the
urge to proceed during the period of high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the
available resources and testing capacity, we aimed to enrol 700-1000 children in total. We
invited all 1299 children from the already invited classes (regardless of previous participation
in the seroprevalence study). With predicted participation rate similar to the other rounds of
testing (50-60%), we expected 750-850 children in this study to take part.

In total, 14 out of 15 invited primary and secondary schools agreed to participate. 641 from
1299 (49%) invited children from 67 invited classes took part at least one time (568 at T1,
602 at T2). Overall participation rate in at least one of the testing was 93% on the school
level, 92% on class level, and 50% (interquartile range 35% to 65%, range 8% to 91%) on the
child level within classes. Characteristics of study participants are given in Table 1. RDT and
PCR were performed for all participating children and teachers. A repeat RDT and PCR in
addition between week 1 and 2 was done in all initially positive children and teachers with a
positive RDT.

[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]

None of the teachers and only 1 child had a positive PCR at any of the two testing
visits, corresponding to a point-prevalence of 0.2% (CI 0% to 1.1%) at T1 and 0% at T2. This
child with positive PCR at T1 had a cycle threshold value of 31-33 (N-Gen 31, RdRP-/S-Gen
32, E-Gen 33), was negative on the RDT at T1 and negative in PCR and RDT at T2. There
were 7 (1.1%) positive RDTs in children and 2 (3.0%) positive RDT in teachers at T1 or T2
among 5 schools (overall point-prevalence 1.3%). 4 positive RDTs were also repeated
immediately with the same buccal swab and remained positive. All 9 positive RDTs were
also repeated 2 hours to 2 days later by taking a new buccal sample, and were negative both
on RDT and PCR, respectively. The signals of the RDTs were in all cases weak-to-moderate
(Figure 1), and were confirmed by two persons experienced in RDT testing and blinded to
reported symptoms and our judgement.

198 (35%) children and 5 (8%) teachers reported mild symptoms during the 5 days
prior to testing (Figure 2). Symptoms of week 1 (T1) and 2 (T2) did not differ significantly.
The child with a positive PCR at T1 reported a runny nose at T1, but not on T2, when a loss
of smell or taste was reported instead. 3 children, but no teachers reported mild symptoms.

DISCUSSION
In this nested study aiming to detect the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools at a
time of high community transmission during the second wave of the pandemic (December
2020) in a country showing one of the highest incidences worldwide. Point-prevalence in
children (0-0.2%) and teachers (0%) was low and clustering on the class or school level thus
unlikely, given that participation of schools, classes and individual children and teachers in
the testing was high. Given the very low point prevalence even in a setting of high incidence
of SARS-CoV-2, the usefulness of a surveillance system for entire schools on an individual,
regional or national level is questionable and currently not needed, especially with a wellfunctioning targeted TTIQ strategy in place for symptomatic children and school personnel.
Specificity of the RDT in children was within the lower boundary of performance and needs
further evaluation for its use as surveillance or targeted TTIQ strategy test in schools.
The very low point-prevalence of 0-0.2% of SARS-CoV2 infected children supports
the debated political decision of many countries to leave schools open despite the striking
numbers of confirmed cases during the second wave of the pandemic. Based on our power
calculation, a high expected ratio of diagnosed to undetected cases (the SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence of roughly 8% in children of the same schools from our main study in
November 2020 with a dark figure of 1:8 [19], and the high case numbers in Switzerland at

the peak of the second wave (i.e., 300 new symptomatic cases per 100’000 inhabitants
between mid-November and mid-December 2020) we expected to detect at least a few
asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic children or teachers in school, but we did not. Based on
the relatively low number of tested children, one has to be careful in drawing too strong
conclusions. Yet, this is a promising finding in consideration of the highly controversial and
debated role of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in schools, [1-3] and given the fact that many
experts support nation-wide school closures [2, 3].
Published modelling studies on the effect of school closures often rely on strong
theoretical assumptions, can often not adequately control for important confounding because
of their ecological nature, and although interesting from a scientific perspective, should not
replace studies based on prospectively collected data. School closures should be the ultimate
decision taken, as they lead to harmful global consequences on health, society and economics
and dramatically increase existing inequalities [27, 28]. Before this is done, less dramatic
decisions with schools remaining open can be taken, although current evidence for their
effectiveness is not well studied [13]. It seems, that established Swiss procedures with
school-based preventive measures (e.g., masks for teachers and children >12 years in the
open space of schools, stable class constellations, tapering school breaks, the ban of group
events such as school camps, physical distancing in class and teachers’ rooms), contact
tracing and leaving febrile and/or highly symptomatic children at home, seem to work in
hindering the SARS-CoV-2 spread by and through children in schools. So far, preliminary
evidence suggests lower transmission from children to teachers than the other way around
[29].
Our results suggest that surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in schools is not
efficient using PCR or RDTs. The prevalence of infections was very low under current
protective measures and regulations of authorities so that many children and school personnel

would need to be tested to identify single unrecognized cases. And even then it is unclear if
such asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic children would infect others as transmission rates
are low [29], and outbreaks infrequent and local [30-32]. Instead, acute virus testing of
children seems more efficient only if they are at least moderately symptomatic [33]. These
children should be sent home anyway but should be tested to trigger TTIQ.
There was one child with a positive PCR test in week 1 with a cycle threshold value
of 31-33 closely above the detection threshold. The second test was negative in week 2, RDT
tests were negative on both occasions. This picture suggests viral shedding during the
postinfectious state [23], rather than a false negative RDT. If the child had had an infectious
state during the first testing, in this case with a false negative RDT, one would expect to have
at least a positive PCR test on week 2. This child was at school with just a runny nose. He/she
was tested with an additional PCR two days after our first PCR due to a positive family
member which was also positive. She/he then went into quarantine together with 3 classmates
that had a close contact until our T2 testing. Interestingly, the child developed anosmia only
at T2 when the PCR test had become negative. Although symptoms in this case were
prolonged to 10 days at least, symptoms occurred during the post-infectious state. Despite the
fact that this child was tested positive on PCR at T1 and went to school at least some days in
an infectious state, there was no report of additional infections of classmates. It is possible
that measures such as wearing masks, physical distancing and hygiene procedures were
sufficient to prevent transmission.
Assuming PCR as gold standard reference method, the 9 false positive RDT tests
were surprising although it is well known that they occur more frequently in low incidence
settings like schools [34]. To differentiate between false and true positive is not always an
easy task. The false positive result is highly likely in all 7 children and 2 teachers, as all
repeat RDTs in a new buccal swab and likewise both PCRs collected in parallel to the RDTs

were negative. The buccal instead of the naso-pharyngeal method has been validated in a
large sample of adult outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms taking the naso-pharyngeal
swab as gold-standard [26]. We cannot fully rule out false negative PCRs, as we did not
measure human genetic material in the PCRs to confirm cellular content in the buccal swab.
As the positive RDTs occurred in different schools at different time points in different age
levels and were analyzed by different personnel that were all tested negative on RDTs taken
at the beginning of the study, we could not detect any systematic factor that might have
caused the false positive results. The negative RDTs in the repeats were promising. Taking a
new buccal swab is important to minimize possible contamination. Our findings are
important as surveillance and screening in the educational system in many countries
nowadays extensively use RDTs without having a control PCR. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention does not recommend screening testing in schools [35], mostly
because real-world studies of its effectiveness are lacking. Yet, cost-effective and important
and prompt decisions for children, families and schools could be taken for instance in
children or teachers with unclear symptomatology or in outbreak situations, given that sameday results can prevent 80% of new transmissions, whereas a 7-day delay stops only 5% [36].
Specificity of RDT in our sample was 99.4% for children which is at the lower boundary of
test performance reported by the company or validation studies in symptomatic adults [22]
with reported specificity of 99.5% (95% CI 98.1% to 99.9%). The specificity was lower for
the teachers, but due to the low number of tested teachers, one has to be very careful in
judging test performance. Until RDTs can be used in surveillance or even with a targeted
TTIQ strategy for children and school personnel, irrespective of symptoms, repeat testing in a
new buccal swab and control PCR should be considered. So far, collection of saliva for
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is increasingly recognized as valid alternative [37].

Strength of the study lies in the population-based sample of mostly asymptomatic
children in schools tested in a country with one of the highest incidences of SARS-CoV-2
worldwide. Further strength of this study is the control of RDT by PCR using a prospective
design. Limitations include the low prevalence of observed acute infections in the school
system, which limited our capability to tease out the usefulness of RDTs as surveillance or a
targeted TTIQ strategy test in schools.

CONCLUSION
This is one of the few SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies in asymptomatic or
oligosymptomatic children in the school setting, documenting that unrecognized virus spread
within schools is not a major problem even in a country with one of the highest SARS-CoV-2
incidence rates during the peak of the second wave in December 2020. Schools seem to be
safe with the protective measures in place. A monitoring system to detect acute infections and
possible clustering in schools even in a high incidence setting of Ciao Corona does not seem
to be informative and thus not needed with the actual preventive measures in place.
