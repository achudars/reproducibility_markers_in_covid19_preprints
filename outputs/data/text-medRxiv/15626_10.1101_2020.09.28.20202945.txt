Abstract
Background: COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 appeared in
December 2019 in Wuhan, China.
Objective: We aimed to investigate the clinical manifestation include signs and symptoms, laboratory
results, and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19.
Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences,
and Google scholar on 07 April 2020. Meta-analysis was performed via CMA software using the
Mantel-Haenszel method. The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each variable.
Results: Ten studies were selected. The pooled prevalence for fever, post-partum fever, cough,
myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, sore throat, and diarrhea were 66.8 %, 37.1 %, 35.5 %, 24.6 %, 14.9%, 14.6
%, 11.5%, and 7.6 %, respectively. Laboratory test results were 49.8 % for lymphopenia, 47.7 % for
leukocytosis, 83.7 % for elevated neutrophil ratio, 57 % for elevated C-reactive protein, and 71.4 % for
decreased lymphocyte ratio. The rate of cesarean section for delivery in all cases was 84%. Only one
case was the newborn of a mother with COVID-19 positive. Also, there was only one death due to
Decreased lymphocyte ratio.
Conclusion: Fever was the most common signs and symptoms in pregnant women with COVID-19.
Among the laboratory tests, the highest amount was related to elevated neutrophil ratio. It seems that
due to the differences between pregnant women and the general population, special measures should be
considered to treat these patients.
Key words: COVID-19, Pregnancy, Diagnosis, Meta-analysis

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) appeared for the first time in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The disease then
spread rapidly around the world to the point where it was confirmed a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) (1, 2). COVID-19 is an infectious disease with respiratory symptoms almost
similar to SARS (2003) and MERS (2012) epidemics (3, 4). In some cases, the disease can lead to a
sensitive respiratory condition, many of which require specialized management in the intensive care
unit (ICU) (5).
Respiratory droplets along with close contact transmission are the considerable routes of transmission.
There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a close environment when exposed to high
concentrations of aerosol for a protracted period (6). On the other hand, touching surfaces or objects
that are touched by an infected person can transmit the disease (7). Studies have also shown that older
age and comorbidity play an important role in determining the severity and clinical consequences of the
disease (8).
Because most studies have focused on patients infected with the new coronavirus in the general
population, bounded details are available regarding pregnancy outcomes in women infected with
COVID-19. It has caused particular concern among pregnant women, as both SARS-CoV and MERSCoV viruses have been shown to cause severe side effects in pregnant women (9, 10). A study by
Wong and colleagues examined pregnant women with SARS in 2004 in Hong Kong and found that
pregnant women showed high rates of death and mortality (11). Also, a study by Mertz et al has been
shown that women infected with influenza were more at risk than healthy pregnant women (12). Chen
and co-authors also reported that pregnancy with pneumonia could be associated with the risk of
cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, a decrease in the baby's Apgar score, and weight loss at birth, and
so on (13).
It is obvious that parturient has relatively depressed immunity or immune suppression and in theory, it
could be more at risk of contracting the virus. Also, confronting SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy is a
serious threat to pregnant women and their fetuses (14, 15). Therefore, during the prevalence of

COVID-19, a disease without approved treatment, it is important to prevent pregnant women from
becoming infected during the epidemic/pandemic period.
Pregnant women are at risk of infection to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia because they
are in an immunosuppressive state and changes in physiological adaptation during pregnancy (eg,
increased diaphragm levels, increased oxygen consumption) can cause hypoxia intolerance in these
patients. For example, the outbreak of influenza in 1918 caused total mortality of 2.6% in the
population, but in pregnant women, it was about 37% (16). It has also been stated that pregnant women
are at increased risk of complications from the H1N1 epidemic influenza virus infection in 2009 and
have been hospitalized more than four times as often as other patients (relative risk 4.3 95% CI: 2.3–
7.8) (17). Therefore, it is important to study COVID-19 signs and symptoms in pregnant women with
the disease and its effects on newborns are very important, and therefore this study is aimed at
investigating the clinical manifestation include signs and symptoms, laboratory results, and prenatal
outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19.

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis followed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement (18).

Eligibility criteria
All studies were included based on the following criteria: they investigated COVID-19 in pregnant
women or during pregnancy and were in the English language. Studies were excluded if the researchers
haven't access to the full-text of the article or the data about the outcomes were not sufficient. Also, we
exclude studies without the peer review process.

Information sources and search
We searched PubMed via LitCovid hub, Embase, Scopus, Web of sciences and Google scholar using a
specific search strategy ("2019 nCoV" OR 2019nCoV OR "2019 novel coronavirus" OR "COVID 19"
OR COVID19 OR "new coronavirus" OR "novel coronavirus" OR "SARS CoV-2" OR (Wuhan AND
coronavirus) OR "COVID 19" OR "SARS-CoV" OR "2019-nCoV" OR "SARS-CoV-2" AND

as type of study or publication date but limited to studies with full-text in the English language. We
also search for the references of included studies for capturing potential studies in this field. In terms of
incomplete data, we contacted the corresponding author of the article for more information.

Study selection
After importing the records to EndNote X7, the duplicate records were removed and then screened
based on the title, abstract, and full-text considering the eligibility criteria. All stages were conducted
using two independent reviewers and the potential disagreements were solved through consultation
with a third reviewer.

Quality appraisal
Two independent reviewers assessed the included studies for quality issues. Because the final studies
were case-series and case-control, the JBI checklists related to this type of study were used. These
checklists include 10 questions for case-control and case-series studies. These questions investigate
issue regarding domain such as inclusion criteria, reliability and validity of methods, sampling process,
transparency in data and results, and statistical analysis. The detail about each question mentioned at
the end of the questionnaire (Supplementary 1). We score one for yes and zero for no in each question.
(19, 20).

Outcomes measures
The investigated outcomes were signs and symptoms (cough, diarrhea, dyspnea, fatigue, fever,
myalgia, sore throat, and post-partum fever), laboratory test results (lymphopenia, leukocytosis,
elevated neutrophil ratio, elevated C-reactive protein, and decreased lymphocyte ration), type of
delivery (cesarean), and perinatal outcomes (COVID-19 positive, low birth weight, premature,
complication, and died). For all outcome variables, we extract the number of events and sample size.

Data analyses
Meta-analysis was performed for signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, and type of delivery using the
event rate (the proportion of the occurrence of an event in the subjects to the total subjects under study)
with CMA (Version 2) software using the Mantel-Haenszel method. Also, we used narrative synthesis
for reporting the results of the perinatal outcome. The Q-value was applied to discover between-study

heterogeneity, and I2 values were calculated to assess statistical heterogeneity. We used random-effect
model based on the level of heterogeneity. In the following of Cochrane criteria if the heterogeneity
was ≥50 we used the random-effect model (21). The event rate with 95% CI was calculated for each
variable. We used Egger’s test and visual inspection of the funnel plot for assessing publication bias.
Also, we conducted a meta-regression for an association between mean age and each sign and
symptoms, laboratory test, and type of delivery.

Results
Description of search

After searching all international databases, 4721 articles were found and after removing duplicate
articles, 3985 articles were examined in terms of title and abstract, out of which 17 articles entered the
next stage. After reviewing the full texts of the articles, 10 articles entered the systematic review (2231). In the screening stages of studies, they were excluded for a variety of reasons, which included
unrelated topics (2 articles), unassociated population (4 articles), and duplicated study (1 article). The
overall sample size of the included studies was 135 Pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis. The
flowchart of the included studies is presented in Figure 1.

Results of meta-regression
According to the findings, the only factor that could be examined in this section was the mean age of
pregnant women. Data analysis showed that older pregnant women significantly have a higher fever
rate (Coefficient=0.477, P=0.033). For the type of delivery, the higher average age of pregnant women
significantly associated with a higher rate in cesarean delivery (Coefficient=0.433, P=0.016). The
results of the relationship between other factors and the average age of pregnant women are shown in
Table IV (Supplementary 2).

Discussion
A total of 10 articles were reviewed in this study, which finally analyzed 135 pregnant women, all of
whom were in the third trimester of pregnancy (22-31). These summary findings help healthcare

workers better manage pregnant women with COVID-19, which could potentially reduce the side
effects for women as well as their newborns.
Common clinical manifestations of pregnant women with COVID-19 include fever and cough, and less
common symptoms were sore throat and diarrhea. Postpartum fever is also more common in women
after childbirth. However, the rate of fever in our study was lower than that of Guan and colleagues,
who studied the symptoms of non-pregnant coronary artery disease and reported a rate of fever of 87.9
percent. But in this study, as in our study, diarrhea was the least common (32).
In terms of laboratory demonstrations, Elevated neutrophil ratio and Decreased lymphocyte ratio have
been common. On the other hand, the prevalence of CRP Elevated in our study was 57 %. However, in
Zhang's and co-authors study, this prevalence in a group of people with non-severe and severe patients
was 88.9 and 96.4%, respectively (33). This indicates a more pronounced inflammation in patients with
more severe conditions and given that pregnant women in this study were not in severe disease
conditions, a lower percentage of increased CRP prevalence is justified. On the other hand, in
Rodriguez-Morales co-workers study, the increased CRP prevalence was 58.3, which is similar to our
study (8). These differences in numbers can be described due to the severity of the disease, and on the
other hand, a more comprehensive examination is needed.
Lymphopenia and Leukocytosis were less common in our study. However, in the study of Zhang and
colleagues and Wang et al, which was performed on patients with corona (normal population),
lymphopenia was the most common laboratory symptom and was 75.4 and 70.3%, respectively (33,
34). However, it should be noted that these numbers are a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count.
In our study, the majority of pregnancies have happened cesarean section, which is much higher than
the World Health Organization's recommendation for vaginal route delivery (35), which can be
determined by a gynecologist to prevent maternal respiratory distress during pregnancy.
In our current study, which examined 135 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, none of the
patients with severe or dead pneumonia were infected with COVID-19 infection. Although SARSCoV-2 has a common sequence with SARS of up to 85%, we need to be aware of the possibility that
the course of the disease and the prognosis of this disease can follow the same SARS process in
pregnant women (36-37).
Our study has some limitations. First, all patients registered in these included articles were in the third
trimester of pregnancy, and the effect of the virus infection on the fetus in the first or second trimester
was unknown. Second, due to the short duration of the outbreak, the long-term consequences of the
19

disease on infants have not been possible and more studies are needed. Third, the low number of
samples of articles included is another limitation of the work. Fourth, all included studies were from
china.
In conclusion, pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia had diverse symptoms; however, fever and
cough are the main clinical symptoms of these women. Although one infant was born with COVID-19
in the included studies, there was little evidence that COVID-19 was transmitted from mother to infant
in late pregnancy. Therefore, the study of long-term outcomes on mother and child, as well as the
vertical transfer of mother to child in second-trimester pregnancies and the first months after delivery,
requires further studies.
