Abstract
This work aims at a better understanding and the optimal control of the spread of the new severe
acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We first propose a multi-scale model giving insights
on the virus population dynamics, the transmission process and the infection mechanism. We consider
10 compartments in the human population in order to take into accounts the effects of different specific
mitigation policies: susceptible, infected, infectious, quarantined, hospitalized, treated, recovered, noninfectious dead, infectious dead, buried. The population of viruses is also partitioned into 10 compartments
corresponding respectively to each of the first nine human population compartments and the free viruses
available in the environment. Indeed, we have human to human virus transmission, human to environment
virus transmission, environment to human virus transmission and self infection by susceptible individuals.
We show the global stability of the disease free equilibrium if a given threshold T0 is less or equal to 1 and
we provide how to compute the basic reproduction number R0 . A convergence index T1 is also defined in
order to estimate the speed at which the disease extincts and an upper bound to the time of extinction is
given. The existence of the endemic equilibrium is conditional and its description is provided. We evaluate
the sensitivity of R0 , T0 and T1 to control parameters such as the maximal human density allowed per unit
of surface, the rate of disinfection both for people and environment, the mobility probability, the wearing
mask probability or efficiency, and the human to human contact rate which results from the previous
one. Except the maximal human density allowed per unit of surface, all those parameters have significant
effects on the qualitative dynamics of the disease. The most significant is the probability of wearing mask
followed by the probability of mobility and the disinfection rate. According to a functional cost taking into
consideration economic impacts of SARS-CoV-2, we determine and discuss optimal fighting strategies.
The study is applied to real available data from Cameroon and an estimation of model parameters is done.
After several simulations, social distancing and the disinfection frequency appear as the main elements of
the optimal control strategy.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization1 (WHO), the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona
virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) previously known as new corona virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) is responsible of an infectious
disease called Covid-19 [49]. In 1937, corona viruses were first identified as infectious bronchitis viruses with
which birds suffered that could devastate poultry stocks. Today, the viruses are the cause of the common
cold in 15% to 30% of all cases. In the past 70 years, researchers have found camels, cattle, cats, dogs,
horses, mice, pigs, rats and turkeys that were infected with corona viruses2 . Older people, and those with
underlying medical problems like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer
are more likely to develop serious illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 3 (CDC) affirms
that the most common ways the virus spreads from an infected person to healthy people around them is
when they cough or sneeze and release viral particles into the air and through touching, hands shaking and
others forms of close personal contact. When healthy people touch objects or surfaces on which there are
viral particles, then touch their eyes, nose or mouth before washing their hands, the virus can spread. In
some rare cases fecal contamination can cause the virus to spread as well. The best way to prevent and
slow down transmission is being well informed about the SARS-CoV-2, the disease, its causes and how it
spreads. Each person protects himself and others from infection by hands washing or using an alcohol based
rub frequently and not touching his face. The SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily through droplets of saliva
or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it is important to also practice
respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). Notice that at this time, there are no
specific vaccines or treatments for Covid-19. Depending on its location the SARS-CoV-2 can leave up to 7
days out of human body [10]. Modeling, analyzing models, estimating risks and forecasting the potential
spread of the disease in population appears very useful for decision makers [32].
Recently, numerous papers (published or not) appeared in order to contribute to the fight against the
pandemic Covid-19. Those papers can be organized in three groups. The first group addressed the problem
of forecasting the disease in order to help decision makers to better evaluate the logistic challenges they will
face [1, 3, 4, 16, 15, 24, 25, 28, 29, 37, 38, 39, 41, 45, 47, 48, 51, 61, 62]. The second category of papers focused
on evaluating the effectiveness of mitigations measures prescribed by the WHO and different governments
in order to define better fighting strategies [5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 29, 34, 37, 41, 44, 45, 46, 50, 53, 55, 54, 60, 62].
The last set of papers studied the social and the economical impacts of the pandemic [35, 59]. As we can
observe in the literature, the wide part of models only consider person to person disease transmission. Of
course it is important, but indirect transmission by environment may also be considered. On the other hand
the virus population dynamics appears also important and should be explicitly studied. Indeed, when an
individual gets in contact with the virus he is not directly infected. He really becomes exposed when the
virus penetrates his organism by oral or respiratory ways. Hence, the exposition is mainly indirect in terms
of human to human or human to environment contacts. This consideration justifies the regular disinfection
of individuals and the environment as recommended by public health agencies. Following the authors in
[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 43], it is important to build and understand models that link the within-host dynamics and
population level dynamics of infectious. The prediction of the behavior of Covid-19 is very difficult because
mitigation strategies are permanently changing. So it could be more efficient given an initial situation to
propose optimal control strategies that will lead to disease extinction at a time to be determined. Hence,
this work proposes efficient and low cost control strategies against Covid-19.
The paper is organized as follows. A model is described in subsection 2.1 and its asymptotic behavior
is studied in subsection 2.2 depending on some critical thresholds we define. In subsection 3.1, we estimate
the parameters of the model according to the real available data from Cameroon. A sensitivity analysis
of critical thresholds depending on some control parameters is carried out in subsection 3.2. Section 4 is
devoted to the design and the computation of optimal control strategies according to different constraints.

Figure 1: Flow chart of the Susceptible (S)- Exposed (E)- Infectious (I)- Quarantined (Q)- Hospitalized (H)Treated (T )- Recovered (R)- Non Infectious Dead (D)- Infectious Dead (DI )- Buried (B) compartmental
model with corresponding viruses subpopulations (Vk , k ∈ {S, E, I, Q, H, T, R, D, DI }) and free viruses in
the environment (VF )
The disease dynamics can be viewed under two angles. Indeed, there are human dynamics on
the first hand and the viruses dynamics on humans or in the environment on the other. We consider ten
compartments in the human population per unit area m−2 : Susceptible (S), Infected (E), Infectious
(I), Quarantined (Q), Hospitalized (H), Treated (T ), Recovered (R), Non-Infectious dead (D), Infectious
dead (DI ), Buried (B). Each individual is assumed to have an external viral load on his body while there
are free viruses in the environment. Again, we emphasis on the fact that getting in contact with viruses
does not mean to be infected, but the infection occurs when the viruses penetrate the organism by oral
or respiratory ways. Thus, we have ten compartments for virus population per individual status group
located in a unitary surface or per unit area of environment virus × m−2 : global load in susceptible
compartment (VS ), global load in infected compartment (VE ), global load in infectious compartment (VI ),
global load in quarantined compartment (VQ ), global load in hospitalized compartment (VH ), global load in
treated compartment (VT ), global load in recovered compartment (VR ), global load in non-infectious dead
compartment (VD ), global load in infectious dead compartment (VDI ), global free load in the environment
(VF ). The viral load is transfered from an individual being in compartment i to the environment (transfer

of type I: τ1,i ) or conversely from the environment to an individual being in compartment i (transfer of type
II: τ2,i ). Additionally, there are viral load transfers among individuals when they are in contact (transfer of
type III: τ3,i ). Notice that Infectious, quarantined, hospitalized and treated individuals produce new viruses
at a rate πi with i indexing a specific compartment. A susceptible individual becomes infected when a virus
passes from the outside of his body to the inside (transfer of type IV: τ4 ). Infected persons die at a rate µ
or become infectious with a rate α1 . An infectious case is reported at a rate q and dies at a rate µ + d. The
probability for a reported infectious person to be asymptomatic and then put in quarantine is p, otherwise
he is admitted to hospital. With a rate α2 an infectious asymptomatic person is admitted to hospital after
complications. Infectious, quarantined and hospitalized individuals die at a rate µ + d or become treated
at the respective rates of γ1 , γ2 and γ3 . A treated individual is out of danger but is still infectious and can
die at a rate µ. Treated persons recover completely and become immune at a rate γ4 . A recovered person
losses his immunity at a rate ` or dies at a rate µ. With a rate ρ1 , a non-infectious dead person is buried
while an infectious dead individual is buried at a rate ρ2 . Indeed, infectious dead persons are potentially
very contagious and it is recommended to bury them rapidly in order to limit contacts.
WHO and the Government of Cameroon recommend several control measures that can be explicitly
listed here as follows:
• Limiting movements through a control parameter (m),

• Limiting the area of movements through a lock-down ratio 1 −

,

• Limiting direct contacts with others through a control parameter (τ3 ),
• Frequently hands washing and disinfection through a control parameter (ω),
• Wearing mask and avoiding to touch the face through a control parameter (u).
• Social distancing which is implemented through limitation of group size per unit area to a maximum
value (κ),
The disease is better contained if its spatial spreading is limited by lock-down. Multiplying movements
increases the risk of being in contact with the virus from environment or from a person after a direct
contact. By frequently hands washing and avoiding to touch the face (especially eyes, nose and mouth),
the probability to get infected is clearly reduced. Wearing mask reduces both the risk of infection and the
release of viruses by infectious, quarantined, hospitalized and treated individuals. We can summarize the
dynamics of Covid-19 by the Figure 1.

Proposition 2.1 shows the validity of the model (1) − (20). It shows the boundedness of the population
density (κ) due to the social distancing. It also allows us to consider separately the microscopic dynamics
(of viruses) and the macroscopic dynamics (of humans). Indeed, control strategies at the microscopic level
concern the individual precautions to be applied (social distancing, mobility, disinfection of people and
surfaces, mask wearing and treatment). At the macroscopic level, the global health policies are considered
(social distancing, wearing mask, screening, rapid burying of infectious dead, isolation and treatment of
infectious). Of course there are measures that act at both levels.

Equilibriums and asymptotic behaviors

Omitting the compartment of buried (B or X10 ), we can address the issue of existence
 of equilibriums.
DF

We are particularly interested in the ’Disease Free Equilibrium’ (DF E = X
,Y
) and other feasible
’Endemic Equilibrium’ (EE = X EE , Y EE ). It is clear that immigration in the infectious compartments
with a constant positive rate makes impossible the existence of the DFE. Thus, we could suppose that
Λi = 0, i = 2, . . . , 6, 8, 9. Such a hypothesis is not restrictive if the fight against the pandemic of corona
virus is done globally (even Λi = 0, i = 1, 7) or a systematic control is applied at all the territorial frontiers
(spatial isolation or lock-down). Notice that if the horizontal recruitment is proportional to the population
with a rate less than the natural death rate then a disease free equilibrium is still possible (the population
goes to extinction since death is dominant). If Λi = 0, i = 1, . . . , 9 then there is no horizontal recruitment
and the only possibility of recruitment of new individuals is only from new births. That last consideration
will be adopted here for simplicity.
Proposition 2.2 Assume that Λi = 0, i = 1, . . . , 9. Then the following statements hold.
(i) The trivial null equilibrium always exists : X = Y = 0,

Let F denote a 16 × 16 matrix given such as F (1, 7) = 1 4 a21 , F (1, 1) = aa12τ4 and F (i, j) = 0

V6,j = J (9, j + 1) if j = 1, . . . , 5, V6,6 = J (9, 9), V6,j = J (9, j + 4) if j = 7, . . . , 16, Vi,6 = J (i + 1, 9) if

to the Van Den Driessche and Watmough method in [56, 57, 58], the basic reproduction number R0 is given
by the spectral radius of the next generation matrix :

R0 = ρ −F V −1 = −F (1, 7) × V −1 (7, 1)
(22)
The effective reproduction number can also be computed by multiplying R0 by the proportion of susceptible
individuals [52]. R0 can be biologically interpreted in this context as the average number of new viruses
generated by an introduced virus during its lifespan.
The infection force λ plays an important role on the disease spreading. Subsequently, regarding the
expression of λ in Table 3, we can see that the use of mask and avoiding to touch the face is crucial to limit
disease spreading. The control u can be viewed as the fraction of time the mask is well used. λ can vary
with time depending on individual human habits. It is interesting to depict how the disease behaves if λ is
a decreasing function of time ( lim λ (t) = 0).

Theorem 2.2 provides a sufficient condition that ensures the stability of the disease free equilibrium.
Moreover, it shows that avoiding to touch the face and the frequency of wearing mask by susceptible
population (u1 via τ4 ), the mobility (m via different contact rate among people τ3 , and with the environment
τ1 ), the disinfection (washing of hands included in) by susceptible population (ω1 ) and social distancing
(reducing κ) are crucial parameters in order to stop the spreading of the disease. The biological interpretation

As we can see in the expressions of TH? and TV? that the higher κ, λ0 , I (0), NV (0) and A are, the
longer the time of disease extinction max {TH? , TV? } is. If the lock-down is applied, then the effective global
population to consider is N G = A N which represents the number of alive persons admitted in a given closed
area. Hence, the lock-down level can be expressed by the ratio 1 − AAG , where AG denotes the real area of
the physical study zone (town, district, department, region, country, continent, or the whole world).

A focus on Cameroonian context
Estimation of parameters

There are several approaches for the estimation of the parameters of a model. A first method is to
discretize the differential equation model with respect to available time series and to fit unknown parameters
by reducing the distance between the numerical solution and observed time series [7]. Another method
consists of empirical estimating function linking the state of the system with the time using times series and
after in estimation through the considered model [6, 16, 40, 47].
Let CRI (t), CRQ (t), CRH (t), CRR (t) and CRD (t) respectively denote the cumulative numbers
of reported infectious cases, of reported quarantined, of reported hospitalized (active cases), of reported
recovery, and of reported dead at time t ≥ t0 , where t0 denotes the date of the first introduction of an
infectious to be evaluated. Notice that those values will be divided by the cumulative surface of living areas
to match with our model. We have

According to some cultural practices in Cameroon, we will assume that the average time before burying
a dead person which is not quarantined is 3 days (ρ1 = 13 ) while the burying immediately follows the death
1
of an infectious (ρ2 = 1). From the literature we will assume that α1 = 14
and γi = 71 , i = 1, . . . , 4. It is
not clearly established in the literature that there is a real immunity, but according to [32], we will suppose
that ` = 2.74 × 10−3 . The recommended social distancing parameter κ in Cameroon is 1 person × m−2 but
we will estimate the real value of κ according to available data and our model.
Regarding the fast growth of reported infectious cases, we assume that CRI can be approximated through
the following regression model
CRI (t) = e(kI (t−t0 )) − 1,

We also assume that t0 QG (s) ds and t0 HG (s) ds can be approximated through similar log-linear

to κ = 8 person × m−2 . According to the density of population per unit of surface5 the minimum value of
κ is fixed to κ = 5.003 × 10−5 person × m−2 . Without social distancing at the disease outbreak, we have
κ = κ and the infection term λS is proportional to the global population (say SG ) due to the mass action.
G (t)
S being bounded from above by κ according to the model, we have a1 (t) = Sκ(t)
. Notice that κ and κ are
non decreasing functions of SG . Thus, we can simplify by assuming that a1 is definitely a constant given by
SG (0)
κ(0) . It is possible to estimate SG and NG (global population of alive or dead except buried individuals)
similarly to TG and RG . Under the hypothesis of homogeneity of the population the values of S, E and I

We used the daily data available on the website www.data.gouv.fr for our estimates. We also used the
situation reports on Covid-19 in Cameroon available on the website https://www.humanitarianresponse.info.
The estimated parameters are given into the Table 4. Figure 3 shows the cumulative reported infectious
cases in Cameroon from the 2nd of March to the 07th of June 2020.
According to the values in Table 4, relation (26) and Theorem 2.2, if people never wear a mask, no
social distancing is applied and only susceptible individuals disinfect themselves, then the rate of complete
disinfection (ω1 ) should not be less than 20 day −1 (ie about once every 72 minutes) in order to have
T0 = 7.3163071 and R0 = 0.887382. If at least the social distancing of 1 person × m−2 is respected then the
lower bound value of ω1 drops to 3 day −1 (ie about once every 30 minutes) in order to have T0 = 5.7754491
and R0 = 0.7064687. Thus, a complementary application of all mitigation measures is mandatory.

Effects of controls on disease dynamics

This section aims at evaluating first the sensitivity of different control parameters with respect to the
thresholds R0 and T0 . The second fold of this section is to survey the effect of some control parameters on
the asymptotic behavior of the disease dynamics. Following Theorem 2.1, we define the convergence index

T1 is an indicator of the rate of the potential convergence of the disease dynamics towards an equilibrium.
Indeed, if T1 > 0 then there is an exponential convergence to the disease free equilibrium. If T1 ≤ 0 then
there is an endemicity of the disease, in particular if T1 is near to zero then we are in the neighborhood of
an endemic equilibrium. T1 is an estimation of the key parameter α which permits according to Theorem
2.3, to bound the average time the disease is expected to disappear.
There are several methods for sensitivity analysis in the literature (see [11, 42] for example). The normalp
ized forward sensitivity index (of variable u with respect to parameter p) Υup = ∂u
∂p u defined in [11] provides
an idea on effect of a local perturbations around a given situation in terms of the values of the parameter
p. Paper [42] presents several alternative methods of assessing the global effect of variation on coefficients:
Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), Spearman rank correlation coefficient (RCC), partial correlation coefficient (PCC), standardized correlation coefficient (SCC), standardized rank correlation coefficient (SRCC),
partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) and Extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (eFAST). The
authors in [42] recommended PRCC and eFAST as robust sensitivity indexes to be used respectively in
cases of monotonic and non-monotonic sensitivities. These indexes are based on samples obtained through
latin hyper cube sampling, Monte-Carlo sampling or any other appropriate experimental design [26]. Hence,
there are statistics and confidence intervals or region can be provided in order to decide on their significance.
We adopt the PRCC with a three levels (−1, 0, +1) fractional experimental design with the factors κ,
q, mi , ui and ωi , i = 1, . . . , 10. Such an experimental design allows us to get a statistical approximation
of optimal parameters based on a quadratic model obtained by regression. Ideally, strategies should be

specific to different compartments. However, since it is difficult to know the status of people, it is reasonable
to apply the same strategies for ”similar” compartments. Thus, we reduce the factors by considering the
classes [1] ≡ {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}, [4] ≡ {4, 5}, and [8] ≡ {8, 9, 10}. We also assume that u8 = u9 = u10 = 0. Finally,
we have 10 factors with two responses T0 and T1 . We consider a 310−6 fractional experimental design with
a sample size 81. The experimental matrix is computed using Box calculus for the aliases with second order
interactions. Table 1 provides us with the codification of factors values that have been arbitrarily chosen
but appear realistic.

Figure 4 shows graphically the effects of control parameters on R0 , T0 and T1 . u1 , m1 , ω1 and ω10 are in
decreasing order the more sensitive parameters with respect to R0 . Thus, an efficient control strategy should
prioritize the usage of mask, the reduction of mobility and the disinfection in class [1] compartment, and the
disinfection of the environment. u1 , ω1 , ω4 and ω10 are in decreasing order the more sensitive parameters
with respect to T0 . Thus, an efficient control strategy based on T0 should prioritize the usage of mask in
class [1], and disinfection in classes [1], [2] and the environment. m1 , u1 , ω1 , and ω10 are in decreasing order
the more sensitive parameters with respect to T1 . Thus, to accelerate the convergence toward the disease
free equilibrium the fighting policies should prioritize the reduction of mobility in class [1], the frequent
usage of mask, the disinfection of people in class [1] and the disinfection of the environment.
Globally, the usage of mask in class [1] compartment is the most sensitive control followed by the
reduction of mobility and the disinfecting in class [1], and the disinfection of the environment. As we can
observe, the effects of the social distancing and the screening, the effect of using masks in class [4], and
the mobility in classes [4] and [8] are not very significant. However, as we will observe in section 4, those
controls have influence on the economical point of view.

4.1

An optimal control analysis
Design of the control strategy

The control parameters we consider here are mainly the limit density of population κ, the probability
of mobility m, the proportion of time spent wearing a mask u, the disinfection rate ω and the reporting rate
of infectious (through screening test especially) q. Indeed, those controls appear explicitly in the expression
of the threshold T0 which will play a similar role to the basic reproduction number. Since the threshold T0
appears important for the asymptotic behavior of the disease, it could be interesting to minimize an analog
to the effective reproduction number : T0 XN1 . Unfortunately, the expression of T0 is very complex and it is
not differentiable with respect to all its parameters. This irregularity involves an additional complexity in
the optimization procedure. Thus, we will consider the infection rate λX1 instead of T0 XN1 . λX1 takes into
consideration the dynamics of viruses.
The medical monitoring of a patient during his infectious period has an economical cost c that can be
evaluated depending on the time spent before recovery and on the expenses during each stay in a disease
compartment. The expression of c should depend on cg , the daily revenue of a person in health which will be
lost due to the disease. The application of each control involves an economical cost proportional to the size
of the population and to the time. We will note the cost per unit of time and per individual cu for u and cω

of gross domestic product assumed proportional to mκ (GDP = g = 1527 U SD × preson−1 × year−1 in
20186 ). A screening test has a cost cs which is not clearly defined according to the media. We will assume
that cs = 10 U SD in average. Since it is difficult to really estimate unreported infectious, it seems better to
define general measures to be applied by everyone independently of the status. Thus, we will assume here
that τ1,i = τ1 , τ2,i = τ2 , τ3,i = τ3 , ui = u, ωi = ω, ςi = ς, mi = m. Let C = (κ, q, u, m, ω). We consider the

where κ = 10 person × m−2 denotes the usual average density of population per unit of surface, and
ω = 1440s−1 is the rate of hands washing corresponding to spending the half of time for disinfection. The
negative term in the expression of Z represents the reduction of economic losses when people are free to
move around in their various economic activities. A negative value of the cost means that globally the losses
due to Covid-19 are not greater than the production of wealth.
We assume that an efficient hands washing takes about 30s. Thus, if ω −1 = 60s the time spent hands
washing is half of the time between two consecutive washes. On the other hand, when ω tends to +∞ then
the proportion of time spent to wash hands is 1. A function of ω displaying the behavior explained above is

for a new mask having a certain unitary cost (1 U SD). Hence, cu = 0.25 U SD × person−1 × hour−1 .

Numerical simulations and discussion

In order to numerically determine the optimal control strategy, we implement the forward-backward
sweep method described in Chapter 3, page 101 of [2]. It is an iterative approach that consists of replacing the
feedback by a guess value first, solving the forward state problem, solving the backward adjoint problem and
then updating the feedback using the gradient direction with a step length obtained by the golden section
method. The algorithm stops when the updates of the control does not significantly change its values
according to a chosen threshold. That method is similar to the one given into the Chapter 3 of [36], but it
permits to better control the convergence. Notice that one could also envisage a method which minimizes
the distance between the final condition of the adjoint problem obtained for a guess initial condition and the
reference final condition. That method could be a multidimensional variant of the secant algorithm [18, 30].
We found after several simulations that, if we globally consider the economic losses and gains then, no
specific control effort is needed additionally to take care of hospitalized patients and putting in quarantine of
infectious reported individuals as it is already done. Probably that is a consequence of the high recovery rate
of patients and the relatively small death probability. However, since the logistic resources for quarantine
and hospitalization are limited, the economical losses in terms of gross domestic product (due to social
distancing, reduction of mobility and lock-down) can be penalized in the cost functional Z. That is done in
the rest of the section.
Figure 5 is an illustration of the optimal control strategy against Covid-19 and the evolution of the
infection force λ. We can observe that social distancing and disinfection frequency are the main elements of
the optimal control strategy. Social distancing permits to have no restriction on mobility. The use of mask
is useful but not necessary when social distancing and regular disinfection are respected. Notice that if the
mask is misused it is useless, and it can promote other respiratory complications. As the sensitivity analysis
showed the screening has no significant effect on disease behavior and it is economically better to keep q at
its minimal value corresponding to self decision to be tested or the hospitalization of severe disease cases.
Figure 6 shows the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 population (in terms of number of viruses per m−2 )
and the disease prevalence either the optimal control is applied or not. Relative prevalence of disease is
preferred over absolute prevalence because it is more appropriate for scaling up. The peak of the disease
occurs earlier and with smaller values under optimal control policy. We also observe that without control
there is a possibility to observe several peaks of the disease. Without control, the peak of the disease (32%
prevalence) occurs after 57 days (about 8.5 weeks) while under control it occurs after 26.37 days (about 4
weeks) with a weaker magnitude (0.4478% prevalence). With the initial compartmental population sizes
given in Table 4 and under the optimal control strategy, the disease extinction in the human population is
reached after 9.571A ×10−3 day×m−2 while it occurs in the virus population after 2.023A ×10−1 day×m−2 .
If we consider the maximal disease prevalence I 1 and the virus population size (NV ) is equal to its upper
bound CV given in Proposition 2.1, then the disease extinction in the human population is reached after
5.499A × 103 day × m−2 . Similarly, the extinction in virus population is reached after 9.8321A × 104 day ×
m−2 . Thus, the sooner the control measures are taken, the sooner the disease can disappear. The dependence
of the disease extinction time with respect to the surface A clearly highlights the importance of lock-down.
As we can observe, the extinction can be very slower in the virus population than in the human population.
The cost of the optimal strategy has been computed for 180 days corresponding to half of the year. It has been
evaluated at A Z ? = 3.978 U SD×A ×m−2 which corresponds on average to 0.0221 U SD×A ×m−2 ×day −1 .

Conclusion

This work is concerned with the mathematical modeling of the severe acute respiratory corona virus 2.
According to governmental data and World Health Organization, the corona virus made several millions of
dead in the world. It spreads very rapidly and affects not only the public health sector, but also the global
economy. The transmission of the disease can occur through direct contact with an infectious individual
or through indirect contacts via the environment. The high complexity of the disease spreading suggested
numerous modeling activities. Indeed, through a mathematical model it is possible to rigorously study
fighting policies against corona. Hence, the goals we aimed to achieve were to propose a realistic model
for the Covid-19 dynamics, to estimate the parameters of the proposed model according to the available
real data, to study asymptotic behaviors depending on some featured control parameters related to WHO
and governmental recommendations, and to design control strategies that are optimal with regards to socioeconomical constraints.
We have constructed a two scale compartmental model with 20 classes corresponding to 10 human
population states (macroscopic scale) and 10 viruses locations (microscopic scale). Indeed, we considered
Susceptible (S), Infected (E), Infectious (I), Quarantined (Q), Hospitalized (H), Treated (T ), Recovered
(R), Non-Infectious dead (D), Infectious dead (DI ), Buried (B). Each individual was assumed to have
an external viral load on his body while there were free viruses in the environment. The model has been
labeled SEIQHT RDDI B −VS VE VI VQ VH VT VR VD VDI VF as described graphically in the Figure 1. To better
access the effects of social distancing, the units of state variables have been taken in terms of person per
unit area and virus per unit of surface. The parameters of the model have been successfully fitted using a
Cameroonian dataset and a semi-empiric procedure. Additionally to the quantitative study of the system,
we carried out a qualitative analysis of the model.
The existence of equilibriums has been studied. Contrarily to the endemic equilibrium, the disease
free equilibrium (DFE) exists unconditionally. The DFE is globally asymptotically stable if a threshold
T0 is less or equal to one. We also provided a formula for the basic reproduction number R0 which
has a biological interpretation regarding the model: the average number of new viruses generated by an
introduced virus during its lifespan. T0 has a similar biological interpretation. A convergence index T1
has been defined. Under an exponential convergence hypothesis, the times of disease extinction respectively
in human population (TH? ) and virus population (TV? ) are determined. A sensitivity analysis of R0 , T0
and T1 have been done using the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). We found that the sensitive
parameters are in descending order the proportion of time of wearing mask, the proportion of time spent

in disinfecting people and the environment, and the mobility probability. Through a concept of specific
area A , the importance of lock-down is highlighted. Indeed, the times of extinction are proportional to A
knowing that 1 − AAG is the lock-down level. Since the disease and the application of the different control
strategies generate economical costs, an optimal control analysis has been already carried out.
In order to guarantee effectiveness of control strategies and to reduce the expenses generated by Covid19, we defined a functional cost to be minimized. The existence and the uniqueness of the optimal control
is established and its characterization is given. By the sweep decent method the optimal strategies are
computed according to some practical constraints materialized by an admissible control set. We found that
if one globally considers the economical losses and gains, then no specific control effort is needed additionally
to taking care of hospitalized patients and putting in quarantine of infectious reported individuals as it is
already done. However, since the logistic resources for quarantine and hospitalization are limited, the
economical losses in terms of gross domestic product (due to social distancing, reduction of mobility and
lock-down) can be penalized in the functional cost. That has been done and we computed new optimal
strategies.
According to the simulations, we observed that social distancing and disinfection frequency are the
main elements of the optimal control strategy. Social distancing permits to have no restriction on mobility.
The use of mask is useful but not necessary when social distancing and regular disinfection are respected.
Screening has no significant effect on disease behavior and it is economically better to keep q at its minimal
value corresponding to self decision to be tested or the hospitalization of severe disease cases. Under the
optimal control policy, the peak of the disease occurs earlier and with smaller values.
The current work has several perspectives. The first one is to take into consideration the effects of
a potential vaccine against Covid-19 both in the asymptotic behavior analysis and in the optimization of
the control strategy. Another aspect is to consider the spatial heterogeneity in terms of available logistic
resources, population densities, attractiveness of specific places at given periods of a day, cultural and
religious habits, and others significant factors. An ongoing work is trying to tackle the problem regarding
those aspects.

Proofs of different results

Proof of Proposition 2.1 .
Assume that the initial condition is taken in Ω. Using Cauchy-Lipschitz Theorem there exists a maximal
solution of the system (21). Assume that the solution is defined and remains nonnegative on a set [0, Tf ].
Then, on ]0, Tf [, N satisfies

Looking carefully the system (1) − (20), we can see that ∀i = 1, . . . , 10, Xi (respectively Yi ) is nonnegative
when Xi = 0 (respectively Yi = 0). This proves the positivity of the solution which is finally global since it
is bounded by the attractiveness of Ω.
Proof of Proposition 2.2.
(i) Regarding the form of the model (21), it is plain that it admits the equilibrium given by X = Y = 0.
(ii) Again, regarding the form of the model (21) the DFE exists if and only if λ = 0 and b1 (κ − X1 ) = µκ.
λX1
Indeed, at the equilibrium X2 = µ+α
. So it is necessary to have λ = 0.

(iii) Once more, regarding the form of the model (21) the EE exists only if λ > 0 and

Proof of Proposition 2.3.
(i) Looking at the expression of J in {0}9 × R+ × {0}10 , we can see that J1,2 = 0 and both matrices
J1,1 and J2,2 have all their eigenvalues negative except J1,1 (10, 10) which is null (the compartment
of buried individuals is a sink). This shows that the set {0}9 × R+ × {0}10 is locally asymptotically
stable (LAS) if b1 ≤ µ.
•

(ii) If bi ≤ µ, i = 1, . . . , 7 then it suffices to look at the equation of N to get that the null equilibrium
X = Y = 0 is GAS. Indeed,

Since the Xi s are nonnegative, if bi ≤ µ, i = 1, . . . , 7 then N converges to 0 and necessarily X and Y
converge to zero by construction of the model.
(iii) From (i) other equilibrium than the null equilibrium is unstable if b1 ≤ µ. So, it is necessary to have
b1 > µ. The disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable (LAS) if J is Metzler stable. That

J2,1 are all Metzler stable (see Proposition 3.1 in [31]). J1,1

and J2,2 are unconditionally Metzler stable. So it remains the stability of the matrix J1,1 −J1,2 J2,2
(iv) Assume that b1 > µ and λ = 0. Due to the linear form of equations (2) − (7) , (9) we can easily see
that Xi , i = 2, . . . , 7, 9 tends to zero. Hence, regarding equations (1) and (8) we can check that X1
tends to X1DF E while X8 tends to

The model has an almost triangular form and is Metzler with a negative diagonal. The matrix M is
Metzler stable by its particular form (M 1,1 is a negative eigenvalue and the complementary diagonal block
is triangular and Metzler stable). The matrix Q is Metzler and stable since its transpose is strictly diagonal
dominant. Using Proposition 3.1 in [31], the stability is ensured if G = M − KQ−1 P is Metzler stable. We

The stability of G is equivalent to the one of the sub-matrix (Gi,j )2≤i,j≤6 due to the particular form of G.

almost surely only one process in the tuple jumps at a given time. Hence, the average time β1 spent by an
individual from his entry in the compartment E to his exit from the compartment T is the sum of average
times he spent in of each the compartment E, I, Q, H and T respectively. If σ1 = min {α, β (1 − pd )} then

Proof of Theorem 4.1.
The existence of the optimal control is guaranteed by the boundedness of
the solution of (1)-(20) and subsequently, the boundedness of the functional cost Z which is continuously
differentiable with respect to its parameters. The rest of the proof is essentially based on the study of
the gradient of the Hamiltonian. Indeed, the minimization consists in moving according to the opposite
direction of the gradient of the Hamiltonian while it is possible and necessary. Precisely, when the gradient
is the null vector then a singular point is reached. If the gradient is not zero but it is not possible to move
again, then the optimum is reached at the boundary of the eligible region 7 . We have

If the optimal control exists then the Algorithm 1 describes it such as a piecewise continuous feedback
which is locally Lipschitz with respect to the state variable and the adjoint state variable. Thus, by the
Cauchy-Lipschitz Theorem the optimal control is unique.
