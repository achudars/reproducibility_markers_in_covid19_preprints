Abstract

Preterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality globally, with many survivors
experiencing long-term adverse consequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that preterm births
dropped dramatically following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Introduction

We undertook a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach
to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise
fashion on 9, 15, and 23 March 2020 on the incidence of preterm birth. We used data from the neonatal
dried blood spot screening programme (2010−2020) and cross-validated these against national perinatal
registry data. Stratified analyses were conducted according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity
analyses to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by
neighbourhood socio-economic status.
Methods

Data on 1,599,547 singleton newborns were available, including 56,720 post-implementation
births. Consistent reductions in preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding
implementation of the 9 March COVID-19 mitigation measures: ±2 months (n=531,823): odds ratio 0.77
(95% confidence interval 0.66–0.91), p=0.002; ±3 months (n=796,531): 0.85 (0.73–0.98), p=0.028; ±4
months (n=1,066,872): 0.84 (0.73–0.97), p=0.023. Decreases observed following the 15 March measures
were of smaller magnitude and not statistically significant. No changes were observed after 23 March.
Preterm birth reductions after 9 March were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in
sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to high-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods, but effect
modification was not statistically significant.
Results

In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation
measures was associated with a 15-23% drop in preterm births in the following months, in agreement
with preliminary observations in other countries. It is now of pivotal importance that integration of
comparable data from across the globe is undertaken to further substantiate these findings and start
exploring the underlying mechanisms.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to help prevent spread of infection and mitigate its
population health effects are having an unprecedented impact on society. The sudden occurrence of the
pandemic and the scale and immediacy of the policy responses taken, provide a unique opportunity to
evaluate their effects as a ‘natural experiment’.1 Intriguingly, recent reports from Denmark and Ireland
independently provided evidence indicating substantial reductions in the number of extremely preterm
and very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) births following national COVID-19 mitigation measures.2,3 Several
potential underlying mechanisms have been proposed, including improvements in ambient air quality,
and reductions in maternal stress and incidence of infections.3
Globally, over one in ten babies are born preterm, and preterm birth is the primary contributor to
mortality in early life.4 In addition, preterm birth survivors and their families frequently experience longterm adverse consequences.5-8 Currently, the opportunities for prevention of preterm birth are very
limited.9 As such, it is of pivotal importance that we further explore the possible link between national
lockdown measures and a decrease in preterm births, and if confirmed, start identifying the underlying
mechanisms to inform and optimise future approaches to help prevent preterm birth from devastating
families’ lives.
At present, although the link between COVID-19 mitigation measures and reductions in preterm birth
identified in the pioneering aforementioned Danish and Irish studies has rightfully sparked substantial
optimism globally regarding its potential to help identify new clues for effective prevention, the
evidence base is still delicate.2,3 Both previous studies had relatively limited sample sizes and the
methodological approaches that were used restrict causal interpretation of the findings. In the current
study we addressed these limitations by using national routinely collected data to study the association
between the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands and the incidence of
preterm birth. We applied a difference-in-regression-discontinuity design, facilitating casual inference
over the non-quasi-experimental approaches used in previous studies.2,3

Methods

We undertook a difference-in-regression-discontinuity analysis to investigate the association between
the national implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures and the incidence of preterm birth, using
national routinely collected data on singleton babies having undergone neonatal blood spot screening in
the Netherlands between October 2010 and July 2020.
Setting and participants

The first recognised COVID-19 case in the Netherlands was confirmed in Noord-Brabant, one of twelve
Dutch provinces, on 27 February 2020.10 The first COVID-19-related death occurred on 6 March, and
from that day people living in Noord-Brabant were advised to stay indoors when experiencing possible
COVID-19 symptoms. On separate occasions between 9 and 23 March, a number of national measures

We obtained data on all singleton babies having undergone neonatal blood spot screening in the
Netherlands between 9 October 2010 and 16 July 2020, the latter date representing the most recent
data available at the time of extraction. The study period was set to include ten years and five months
pre-implementation of the first national COVID-19 mitigation measures (9 March 2020; Table 1). Data
were extracted from the Praeventis database, as provided by the National Institute for Public Health and
the Environment (RIVM).11 Praeventis is a national database containing data from all babies having
undergone neonatal blood spot screening. In the national screening programme, newborns are screened
for a range of diseases after 72 hours of life. Screening can take place in the hospital or at home. The
proportion of Dutch babies undergoing neonatal blood spot screening is consistently >99%,12 hence the
Praeventis database may be considered to be highly representative of all births in the Netherlands. On
the neonatal dried blood spot card, health professionals record several maternal and neonatal
characteristics for each registered individual.13
For the purpose of this study, multiple births were excluded due to their inherent increased risk of
preterm birth. Multiple births were identified based on having multiple records registered with identical
surnames, birth dates and postcode. We furthermore excluded babies whose registered gestational age
was below 24+0 weeks or above 41+6 weeks. Dutch national multidisciplinary guidelines have set the
threshold of viability at 24+0 weeks and advise against active management of babies born at lower
gestational ages.14

For validation purposes, characteristics of our cohort were cross-referenced at aggregate level against
data from Perined for selected years. Perined is the national linked pregnancy and birth registry which is
based on data provided by midwifery, general practice, and obstetric and paediatric practices.15 Perined
data are typically made available 1-2 years following initial registration of pregnancies and births, hence
invalidating the use of Perined data to address our primary research question at present.
Variables and data source

The following individual-level data were extracted from Praeventis: 1. calendar week of birth; 2.
gestational age (in days); 3. birth weight (in grams); 4. sex; and 5. four-digit postcode. Four-digit
postcode identifies areas with an average of 2,160 households and was used to derive: 1. province of
residence; 2. neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES; in quintiles); and 3. neighbourhood
urbanisation level. Neighbourhood SES scores are calculated by The Netherlands Institute for Social
Research (SCP) since 1998 and updated every four years since.16 SES scores are based on: mean
household income, proportion of population with low income, proportion of population with low
educational level, proportion of population without paid work. Urbanisation level was dichotomised,
with urban areas having >2,500 addresses per km2. Individual-level sex- and gestational age-specific
birth weight centiles were calculated using national reference curves.17
Sample size

Two earlier studies have identified a link between national implementation of COVID-19 mitigation
measures and a reduction in extremely preterm and VLBW births.2,3 In the Danish study,2 national data
on post-implementation births were available for 5,162 singleton births. The Irish study was a singlecentre study and had 1,381 births available for analysis.3 The Netherlands has approximately 170,000
births annually. This translates into an anticipated ~60,000 births post-implementation, including ~4,000
preterm births. We anticipated that this would provide ample statistical power to identify an association
between the COVID-19 mitigation measures and preterm births in the Netherlands, if present.
Statistical analyses

We tabulated characteristics of the study population according to the time periods from which they
were derived. We furthermore tabulated selected characteristics against published Perined annual
reports, available up to 2018.18
We studied the association between national implementation of the COVID-19 mitigation measures and
the incidence of preterm births using a difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach.19,20 Differencein-regression-discontinuity is a quasi-experimental technique that can be used when the exposure of
interest is assigned by the value of a continuously measured random variable and whether that variable
lies above (or below) some cut-off value. In this study, calendar week of birth is the assignment variable
and the cut-off corresponds to the implementation dates of COVID-19 mitigation measures. We
conducted separate analyses for the 9, 15, and 23 March implementation of COVID-19 mitigation
measures (Table 1). A separate analysis was not possible for the 12 March measures given temporal
granularity of the individual-level data (i.e. weekly rather than daily). We a priori hypothesised that any

reductions in preterm birth would most likely have followed the 15 March 2020 measures as these were
considered to be most comprehensive. We assessed four time-windows before and after the
intervention in separate analyses: one, two, three, and four months pre- and post-implementation.
Using such relatively short discrete time allows us to exclude other interventions or major influences,
and make the assumption that any change observed is indeed due to the COVID-19 mitigation measures.
The approach allows for comparison of the incidence of preterm birth in the period directly preceding
implementation of the measures versus the period directly following implementation. With the shortest
time window (i.e. one month), the estimated impact of the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation
measures may be closest to the true immediate impact, but the power to detect this impact is limited.
Using wider time windows, power to detect the true impact will increase, but potentially at the expense
of introducing variation from temporal trends or unmeasured confounding. The analyses account for
seasonal variation and potential other time-variant factors affecting preterm birth incidence by
comparing the period surrounding the implementation of the measures in 2020 to the exact same time
periods in each year preceding the COVID-19 pandemic (2010-2019). By following this approach there is
no need to adjust for individual-level variables in the analysis.
The assumptions and conditions for a valid regression discontinuity were met: a) the cut-off value (9, 15
or 23 March 2020) and decision rule (exposed or unexposed to COVID-19 mitigation measures) are
known; b) the assignment variable (week of birth) is continuous around the cut-off and not affected by
the lockdown, as shown in the Supplement page 1; c) the outcomes are continuous at the threshold and
are observed for all pregnancies; d) graphical analysis shows a discontinuity around the threshold,
suggesting an intervention effect (Supplement page 2-13).
In the primary analyses, the outcome of interest was the overall incidence of preterm birth (i.e. number
of babies born at a gestational age <37+0 weeks per 1,000 babies having undergone neonatal blood spot
screening). In additional stratified analyses we assessed whether there were any differential changes in
preterm birth incidence following the COVID-19 mitigation measures according to the degree of
prematurity: 24+0 – 25+6 weeks, 26+0 – 27+6 weeks, 28+0 – 31+6 weeks, and 32+0 – 36+6 weeks.
Substantial evidence indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its
impact are differentially affecting socio-economic groups.21,22 To assess whether there has been
variation in impact of the Dutch COVID-19 mitigation measures according to SES, we tested for potential
effect modification by neighbourhood SES by including an interaction term in the analyses.
Some mechanisms potentially underlying a link between the COVID-19 mitigation measures and preterm
birth may not have an immediate impact. On the other hand, there may have been anticipatory effects
as part of the population may already have changed their behavior prior to formal implementation of
the COVID-19 mitigation measures. To address this we conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses
introducing a period of censoring of data, thus excluding data from the first week and from the first two
weeks directly prior to and directly following introduction of the measures.

Ethical considerations

According to Dutch law (WMO) no formal ethical review was required for this study. According to
standard procedures and under strict conditions that were fulfilled, RIVM allows anonymised data
registered as part of the screening programme to be used for research purposes with waiver of
consent.23 A protocol for the study was develop a priori and approved by RIVM prior to data provision.

Results

There were 1,707,594 records in the Praeventis neonatal screening database in the study period. After
exclusion of neonates born outside the Netherlands, duplicate records, multiple births, and neonates
with gestational age missing, <24+0 weeks or >41+6 weeks, individual-level data on 1,599,547 singleton
neonates were available for analysis (Figure 1). Characteristics of this population are shown in Table 2.
Cross-validation against Perined data for selected years (i.e. 2011, 2014 and 2017) showed that babies
born at the lowest gestational ages and those with the lowest birth weights were somewhat
underrepresented in our population, which was stable over time (Supplement page 14).

Figure 1: Flowchart of study population composition

Time trends in preterm births in the four months pre- and post-implementation of the COVID-19
mitigation measures are shown in Figure 2 and Supplement page 2-13. A clear discontinuity in the
regression lines is observed when considering the initial set of COVID-19 mitigation measures
introduced on 9 March 2020. Accordingly, implementation of the 9 March measures was consistently

associated with substantial reductions in preterm birth across the two- to four-month time windows
surrounding implementation: ±2 months (n=531,823): odds ratio (OR) 0.77 (95% confidence interval (CI)

(0.73–0.97), p=0.02 (Table 3). These reductions in preterm births were apparent across gestational age
strata, albeit statistically significant only in the 32+0 to 36+6-week subgroup (Table 3). No significant
impact on preterm birth was observed when considering the dates that the initial 9 March measures
were extended as the primary intervention dates (i.e. 15 and 23 March; Table 3).

Figure 2: Regression discontinuity in weekly preterm birth incidence surrounding implementation of
COVID-19 mitigation measures

Given these findings and to restrict the number of analyses, we explored effect modification and
conducted sensitivity analyses only for the 9 March COVID-19 mitigation measures, and only for the
overall incidence of preterm birth. Although exploration of potential effect modification by
neighbourhood SES suggested that the reductions in preterm birth predominantly occurred in those
living in high-SES neighbourhoods, this was not statistically significant (Supplement page 15). Findings
were robust to censoring of one or two weeks of data prior to or following the 9 March measures, and
remained statistically significant predominantly for the two-month time window (Supplement page 16).

Discussion

In this large national quasi-experimental study spanning a 10-year period, substantial reductions in
preterm births were observed following implementation of the first national COVID-19 mitigation
measures in the Netherlands. These reductions were consistent across various degrees of prematurity.
No significant impact of extension of the measures introduced one and two weeks later was observed.
Taken together with preliminary evidence from other countries,2,3 these findings open up important
opportunities to help identify novel preventive strategies for preterm birth.

Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) from difference-in-regression-discontinuity analysis of various time windows around
national implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures versus the same periods across previous years.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is by far the largest to have assessed the impact of COVID-19
mitigation measures on the incidence of preterm birth. Making use of national-level routinely collected
data, we had over 1.5 million individual records available for analysis, including over 55 thousand babies
born after implementation of the measures in the Netherlands. Since over 99% of babies in the
Netherlands undergoes neonatal dried blood spot screening,12 and very few babies in the dataset had
missing outcome data, our data are highly representative. By applying a quasi-experimental approach,
our study progresses substantially from earlier uncontrolled before-after studies, thus maximising
opportunities for causal interpretation.19 Our findings were in addition robust to various model
specifications, further strengthening confidence in our findings.
Our study also has limitations. Given the unanticipated nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated
mitigation measures, we had to use a retrospective approach to data collection. As in any registry-based
study, there may have been registration errors, and a very small proportion of individuals had missing
data. Cross-validation against Perined suggested very little temporal variation in comparability of the
data or missing variables, which − even if present − should have been captured by our difference-inregression-discontinuity design, making any impact on our effect estimation unlikely. There was a slight
underrepresentation of extremely preterm and ELBW births in our dataset as compared to Perined. This
was anticipated as a result of three issues: 1. aggregated birth weight data for Perined included babies
born between 22+0 and 23+6 weeks, hence explaining overrepresentation of ELBW babies in Perined; 2.

Perined data include stillbirths; and 3. extremely preterm babies are at increased risk of dying in the first
few days after birth.24 For obvious reasons, stillborn babies and those dying shortly after birth did not
contribute data to the neonatal screening programme and hence were missing from our dataset.
Importantly, our validation indicates that this relative underrepresentation was not differential over
time and is therefore unlikely to have influenced our findings. If anything, survival of preterm babies
improved over the study period, which would have biased our findings towards the null. Finally, our
dataset lacked information on mode of delivery or labour induction, limiting our ability to identify any
differential impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures on spontaneous versus induced preterm births.
Our study progresses from earlier work in a number of ways, including using robust quasi-experimental
methodology and having a much larger sample size.19,20,25 Although in the Irish study none of the
January-April periods in the 19 years preceding 2020 had seen proportions of extremely-low-birthweight (ELBW) and VLBW births as low as in 2020,3 the numbers of observed versus anticipated ELBW
and VLWB births were very small (none versus four, and three versus 11, respectively). Furthermore, of
the four months in 2020 across which births were evaluated against preceding data, only one-and-a-half
were in fact post-implementation of the lockdown measures, complicating causal interpretation. Similar
to ours, the Danish study used national data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme.2
Based on figures presented in their manuscript, we calculated that only one extremely preterm birth
had been observed in the first month following lockdown, where five to six were expected. Again, a
striking relative reduction but a small drop in absolute terms. Intriguingly, the observed reduction in
preterm births in Denmark and Ireland predominantly affected the very smallest babies,2,3 whereas in
our study the decrease was fairly constant across gestational age strata. This is important, as the vast
majority of preterm babies are born moderately to late preterm (i.e. 32+0 to 36+6 weeks), and our data
suggest that prevention might be possible for the smallest up to the largest groups. A comparison of
birth outcomes in a London hospital before and after manifestation of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealed
no changes in the incidence of preterm births or of births before 34 weeks gestation.26 Again, this study
had a small sample size and it did not specifically investigate impact of the lockdown, hampering
comparison. Interestingly, they noted an increase in stillbirths of six per 1,000 following the COVID-19
pandemic.26 As contemporary information on stillbirths was unavailable in our study, we could not
discern whether a small part of the observed reduction in preterm births might have occurred at the
expense of an increase in stillbirths.
The aetiology of spontaneous preterm birth, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of all preterm births,
is largely obscure and likely multifactorial, hampering effective prevention.27 Many of the known risk
factors for preterm birth may be positively influenced by implementation of COVID-19 mitigation
measures. This includes asymptomatic maternal infection, which by means of vertical transmission can
cause intrauterine infection, initiating a cascade resulting in preterm birth.27,28 Physical distancing and
self-isolation, lack of commuting, closing of schools and childcare facilities, and increased awareness of
the importance of hygiene (e.g. hand-washing) all reduce contact with pathogens, and accordingly, risk
of infection. Timing of the observed preterm birth reductions directly following the first set of COVID-19
mitigation measures suggests that hygiene measures and anticipatory behavioural changes have been
most instrumental. In addition, closure of most businesses and obligatory home assignments likely

resulted in less physical demanding work, less shift-work, less work-related stress, optimisation of sleep
duration, uptake of maternal exercise in- and outdoors, and increased social support, which all may have
had a positive impact. Substantial reductions in air pollution have furthermore been reported following
COVID-19 mitigation measures across the globe.29 Given the recognised increased risk of delivering
preterm when being exposed to air pollution,30 this may explain part of the observed reductions. It is
furthermore important to note that a large minority of preterm births is in fact iatrogenic. That is,
obstetricians induce delivery, usually for maternal or fetal health concerns. As such, changes in obstetric
practice or care-seeking behaviour of pregnant women may also have contributed. Finally, substantial
evidence indicates that the pandemic and associated lockdown measures have aggravated existing
health and socioeconomic inequalities within populations.21,22 In this regard, the signal in our data −
albeit not statistically significant − suggesting that the reductions in preterm births were confined to
people living in high-SES neighbourhoods is of considerable concern and requires further study.
Preterm birth is the primary contributor to mortality and morbidity in early childhood.4 Survivors are at
increased risk of long-term negative consequences, including adverse cognitive and motor
development,6,7 behavioural and mental health problems,5,31 and respiratory disorders.8 Globally, the
incidence of preterm birth is on the rise,4 and current options for prevention are very limited.9 Here, we
demonstrate that national introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands was
associated with a 15-23% reduction in preterm births, substantiating preliminary findings from other
countries.2,3 COVID-19 mitigation measures have been implemented across countries with substantial
variation in timing, content and comprehensiveness.32 Similarly, levels of various risk factors for preterm
delivery that might be responsive to lockdown measures also vary across populations. International
collaborative efforts will be key to incorporating these sources of variation in innovative global
evaluations to further study the link between COVID-19 mitigation measures and preterm births.
Identification of the underlying mechanisms may then inform the development of much needed novel
preventive strategies for preterm birth.
