WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
•
•

•

Test results indicating the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are often referred to
as Immunity Passports or Certificates.
Due to the limitations of such tests, including uncertainty about the duration of
immunity conferred by detected antibodies, those receiving results indicating the
presence of antibodies retain a risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2.
It is unknown whether the use of the terms Immunity Passports or Certificates reduces
awareness of the residual risk inherent in an antibody-positive test result and
adherence to protective behaviours, thereby increasing risk of transmission.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
•

•
•

Using the term Immunity - as opposed to Antibody - to describe antibody tests for
SARS-CoV-2 more than doubled the proportion who erroneously perceived they
would have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future given an antibody-positive
test result, from 9.8% for Antibody to 19.1% for Immunity.
Perceiving no risk of infection with coronavirus given an antibody-positive test result
was associated with an intention to wash hands less frequently.
Using the terms Passport, Certificate or Test had no significant effect.

Objective: To assess the impact of describing an antibody-positive test result using the terms
Immunity and Passport or Certificate, alone or in combination, on perceived risk of becoming
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and intention to continue protective behaviours.
Design: 2 × 3 experimental design.
Setting: Online with data collected between 28th April and 1st May 2020.
Participants: 1,204 adults registered with a UK research panel.
Intervention: Participants were randomised to receive one of six descriptions of an antibody
test and results showing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, differing in the terms used to describe the
type of test (Immunity vs Antibody) and the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test).
Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of participants
perceiving no risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 given an antibody positive test
result. Other outcomes include intended changes to frequency of handwashing and physical
distancing.
Results: When using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), 19.1% of participants [95% CI: 16.1
to 22.5] (vs 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4]) perceived no risk of catching coronavirus at some
point in the future given an antibody-positive test result (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]).
Using the terms Passport or Certificate – as opposed to Test – had no significant effect
(AOR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.62 to 2.48] and AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47 to 1.99] respectively).
There was no significant interaction between the effects of the test and result terminology.
Across groups, perceiving no risk of infection was associated with an intention to wash hands
less frequently (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]) but there was no significant association
with intended avoidance of physical contact with others outside of the home (AOR: 1.37
[95% CI: 0.93-2.03]).
Conclusions: Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody) to describe antibody tests for SARSCoV-2 increases the proportion of people believing that an antibody-positive result means
they have no risk of catching coronavirus in the future, a perception that may be associated
with less frequent handwashing. The way antibody testing is described may have
implications for the likely impact of testing on transmission rates.

Introduction
At the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, about a third of the world’s
population is estimated to have been in lockdown, with all but essential workers largely
confined to home (1).
Without an effective treatment or vaccine, testing for infection combined with contact tracing
and isolation will be central to effective strategies to ease populations out of lockdown while
keeping the basic reproduction number (R0) below one (2).
Testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is a possible complement to testing for active
infection to identify those who have developed antibodies to the virus and so may be able to
return to work and other activities without significantly increasing transmission rates
(3). These tests have been variously described in the media as Immunity Passports (4,5),
Immunity Certificates (6,7) Immunity Cards (8) and Release Certificates (9). Unfortunately,
the use of these terms implies a certainty unmatched by current evidence about antibody tests
(10).
Uncertainties inherent in tests for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 include the extent and duration
of immunity conferred (11). They also include the uncertainties inherent in any test regarding
the proportion of those who would be correctly identified. This depends upon the test
performance – its sensitivity and specificity – as well as the population prevalence of the
tested condition (12). Given these uncertainties, those who receive a test result indicating the
presence of antibodies will have a residual risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the
future.
Understanding that there is this residual risk – albeit one that is difficult to quantify at present
– will be important to minimise transmission that could arise from those receiving “antibody
positive” test results. If people testing positive perceive that they have no risk of becoming
infected by the virus, they may ignore any future symptoms of infection and facilitate
transmission if they fail to self-isolate appropriately. Such a perception may also overgeneralise to a belief that they are unable to transmit infection through contact with
contaminated surfaces. Regardless of antibody status, all individuals can indirectly transmit
the virus between surfaces by touch. Hand washing or sanitising therefore need to remain
frequent.
Evidence from other testing programmes suggests that interpreting a low risk result to mean
no risk can be reduced by verbal and numerical expressions of residual risk when presenting
test results (13,14). But even before testing programmes are in place, the terms commonly
used to describe these tests – Immunity Passport or Certificates – may inadvertently be
fuelling a misplaced sense of certainty about their results. It is unknown whether describing
these tests as being for immunity – as opposed to antibodies – or their results as passports or
certificates increases misunderstanding of the residual risk inherent in an antibody-positive

test result and thereby reducing adherence to protective behaviours and increasing risk of
transmission (15).
This study was designed to test two hypotheses: describing a test indicating the presence of
antibodies using the term Immunity (vs Antibody), and describing test results as Passports or
Certificates (vs Test), increases the likelihood that those with this test result erroneously
perceive they have no risk of becoming infected in the future with coronavirus.

Methods
Ethical approval for this study was granted by the King’s College London Research Ethics
Committee (reference: MRA-19/20-18685).
The protocol was preregistered on the Open Science Framework https://osf.io/tjwz8/ Study 2
The statistical analysis plan was pre-specified and uploaded to the Open Science Framework
prior to receipt of the data https://osf.io/tjwz8/ Study 2
An initial study with similar methods was conducted https://osf.io/tjwz8/ Study 1 but, due to
an error, the intervention was not correctly programmed. This study is therefore not reported.

Design
The study was an online experiment using a 2 × 3 factorial design, with participants
randomised, with an equal allocation ratio, to one of six groups varying in the description of
an antibody test and a result showing the presence of antibodies. These descriptions differed
only in the term used for what was being tested (Immunity vs Antibody) and the term used
for the test result (Passport vs Certificate vs Test).
Participants
A quota sample of 1,204 adults was recruited via Predictiv, the Behavioural Insights Team’s
online experimentation platform (https://www.bi.team/bi-ventures/predictiv/) comprising
500,000 adults in the UK. Quotas were based on age, gender and UK region to achieve a
sample broadly representative of the UK population. 1373 clicked on the link to enter the
study of whom 1214 subsequently completed the study. Ten were excluded for failing to
meet quality checks. Participants were reimbursed in points (equivalent to £1) which could be
redeemed in cash, gift vouchers or charitable donations. Participants did not know the topic
of the study prior to participation.
Patient and public involvement
Due to the rapid nature of this research, the public was not involved in the development of
the study.

Power
The sample size was chosen pragmatically without reference to a specific power calculation.
We are fitting a full model with an interaction. Conservatively, we then had an 80% chance
of detecting, at a 5% significance level, an increase in the primary outcome measure from
50% in a baseline group to 64% in another group.
Randomisation
Participants were randomised to groups by random number generation. A random number
between 1 and 6 was generated for every participant upon entry to the study to determine
which description they saw, with each of the six numbers corresponding to one of the six
description. As this is based on true randomness, the number of participants within each
group can vary due to chance.
Intervention
The intervention comprised a description of antibody testing and test results indicating the
presence of antibodies [see Box 1 for one example and S1 for wording of all six
descriptions]. These differed across six groups in test name of results indicating the presence
of antibodies. All descriptions included the information that the result would mean a lower
risk of future infection and transmission, and that people with this result could return to work
earlier.
Box Immunity Passport: one of the six descriptions of an antibody-positive test result

Immunity Passport
Scientists are developing tests to see who has already had coronavirus.
No test is 100% effective.
This means that those who test ‘positive’ would have:
•
•

Lower risk of catching coronavirus in the future, and therefore also
Lower risk of passing it on to others

Those who test ‘positive’ would get an immunity passport.
They could return to work early.

Outcomes measures
Wording of the items used for each measure is shown in Supplementary Materials (S2).

Primary outcome
Proportion of participants perceiving an antibody-positive test result to mean no risk of
catching coronavirus in the future, assessed in response to a question with four response
options.
Secondary outcomes
Perceived likelihood of catching coronavirus in the future, assessed on a visual analogue
scale from 0% to 100%.
Intention to engage in handwashing less or more frequently than now, given an antibodypositive test result: assessed in response to a question with five response options.
Intention to avoid physical contact with others outside the home more or less frequently than
now, given an antibody-positive test result: assessed in response to a question with five
response options.
Interest in undergoing the test if offered today: assessed in response to a question with four
response options.
Other measures
Demographic characteristics: age, gender, level of education and geographical region of
residence. Employment status, planned to be included, was omitted due to a technical error.
Statistical analyses
A detailed statistical analysis plan is available on the Open Science Framework, specified
prior to receipt of the data https://osf.io/tjwz8/ Study 2. Binary logistic regression was used to
assess the impact of test type (immunity/antibody) and result type (passport/certificate/test)
on the odds of believing the antibody test result means there is no risk of future infection. An
interaction term was included in the model (16). The analysis was repeated adjusting for age
(including a quadratic function to model a non-linear relationship), gender, education and
region based on prior results showing these are predictors of risk beliefs.
Binary logistic regressions were run (as above) for the secondary outcomes: intention to wash
hands less, intention to engage less in social distancing and intention to undergo the test.
Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are reported. Logistic
regression was run to assess the extent to which intentions to engage in less frequent
handwashing or social distancing measures is predicted by perceiving the test result to mean
no risk of being infected in the future by coronavirus.
As only a very small proportion of participants gave a ‘zero’ response on the sliding scale of
future risk, we used a linear regression model to examine this outcome, rather than a binary
(zero vs. other) logistic regression as pre-specified in the analysis plan.

Data were collected using an online survey platform, Predictiv. Upon entry to the study,
participants were informed that they were to be asked some questions about coronavirus and
that it would take about five minutes to complete. Participants were then shown one of six
brief descriptions of an antibody test for coronavirus (see S1 for full text for each of the six
descriptions). They were then asked five questions, assessing the primary and secondary
outcomes. Participants’ demographic characteristics were accessed from the survey platform.

Results
Sample characteristics
The sample comprised 606 women and 598 men with a median age of 36 years. Around a
quarter had some graduate-level education (24.2%) and there was good representation of all
UK regions (see Table 1). Distribution of sample characteristics by exposure group is shown
in Table 1.
Descriptive statistics
Primary outcome
Responses to the five outcome questions for the whole sample and by experimental group are
shown in Table 2. Overall, 14.5% of respondents [95% CI: 12.5 to 16.6] interpreted the test
result as meaning they had no risk of future infection. Over half (57.8% [95% CI: 55.0 to
60.1]) correctly interpreted the test result as meaning that their future risk of coronavirus was
‘lower’.
Secondary outcomes
Perceived level of future risk (on a scale of 0 to 100%) showed a complex, trimodal
distribution. The median was 35% with an interquartile range from 18% to 51%. Only 5% of
respondents put their risk at 0%. Overall, 63% put their risk below 50%. 10% put their risk at
50%, which was the modal response. 24% put their risk at greater than 50%, but below
100%. 3% of respondents put their risk at 100%: that is, they said they were certain to
contract the virus.
On the behavioural outcomes, 4.9% [95% CI: 3.8 to 6.3] said they would wash their hands
less frequently than now if they received a positive result while 19.7% [95% CI: 17.5 to 22.1]
said they would be less inclined to avoid physical contact with others outside the home.
Intentions to have the test if offered were high, with 56.1% [95% CI: 53.2 to 58.9] saying
they would definitely, and 29.2% [95% CI: 26.6 to 31.8] saying they would probably have
the test if offered today.

Between-group differences in the primary outcome
When Test type (Immunity vs. Antibody), Result type (Certificate vs. Passport vs. Test) and
an interaction term were entered into a logistic regression model predicting the belief that the
test result meant ‘no risk’ of future infection (see Table 3), there was a significant effect of
Test type, which persisted when we adjusted for demographic factors (age (including a
quadratic term), gender, education level and UK region; AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55].
Those in the ‘Immunity’ group were more likely to believe the result meant ‘no risk’ than
those in the Antibody group (19.1% [95% CI: 16.1 to 22.5] vs. 9.8% [95% CI: 7.5 to 12.4])
[Figure 1]. There was no significant effect of result type and no significant interaction.
Between-group differences in secondary outcomes
We analysed the continuous measures of future perceived risk of infection using a linear
model (ANOVA) with two levels for test type, three levels for result type, and an interaction
term. Overall, there was no significant effect: F5,1198 = 1.46, p = 0.20, adjusted R2 < 1%. We
repeated the analysis adjusting for demographic factors as covariates. Overall, there was a
significant effect: F13,1165 = 1.88, p = 0.03, adjusted R2 = 1%. This was because of a
significant effect of age: as age increased, perceived risk decreased. There remained no
significant effect of the experimental variables.
Logistic regression analyses examining the impact of Test type, Result type and their
interaction on intentions to wash hands and avoid physical contact less frequently and on
willingness to have the test are shown in Supplementary tables 1 and 2. Neither Test type,
Result type nor their interaction were significantly associated with these behavioural
outcomes.
Association between test result meaning ‘no risk’ and behavioural intentions
Logistic regression analyses were used to examine belief that the result meant ‘no risk’ as a
predictor of intention to wash hands and avoid physical contact less frequently, given a
positive result (see Figure 2 and Supplementary table 3). In analyses adjusting for
demographic factors, those who believed there was no residual risk were at increased odds of
intending to wash their hands less (AOR: 2.32 [95% CI: 1.25 to 4.28]). The association with
intentions to physically distance outside the home was not significant (AOR: 1.37 [95% CI:
0.93 to 2.03]).

Discussion
Using the term Immunity – as opposed to Antibody – to describe antibody tests for SARSCoV-2 doubled the proportion who erroneously perceived they would have no risk of
becoming infected with the virus in the future if they were given an antibody-positive test
result, from 9.8% for Antibody to 19.1% for Immunity (AOR: 2.91 [95% CI: 1.52 to 5.55]).
Using the terms Passport, Certificate or Test to describe the results had no significant effect
on risk perception (AOR: 0.96 [95% CI: 0.47-1.99] for Certificate and 1.24 [0.62-2.48] for
Passport, compared with Test). The terms used to describe the test and results had no
significant direct impact on intentions to engage in the protective behaviours of handwashing
or physical distancing. However, across conditions, a greater proportion of those perceiving
the result to mean no risk intended to wash their hands less often (10.3% [95% CI: 6.3 to
15.9]) compared with 4.0% who understood there was a residual risk (4.3% [95% CI: 2.8 to
5.3]).
These was no significant association with intended frequency of avoiding physical contact
with others outside of the home. Interest in undergoing the test was high – with 85.2% saying
they would probably or definitely have it if offered – and was unaffected by the terms used to
describe the tests.
This study was designed to test two hypotheses, providing strong support for the first, that
describing a test indicating the presence of antibodies using the term Immunity (vs Antibody)
increases the likelihood that those with this test result erroneously perceive they have no risk
of becoming infected in the future with coronavirus. This likely reflects a certainty about risk
of future infection implicit in lay understandings of the term immunity that is not implied by
the term antibody (17). Qualitative studies could explore this and other potential mechanisms
for the effect observed.
The results of this study did not support the second hypothesis that describing test results as
Passports or Certificates increases the likelihood that those with this test result erroneously
perceive they have no risk of becoming infected in the future with coronavirus. This does not
mean that these terms are unproblematic however, only that they did not influence the
specific perceptions that we explored. Qualitative studies are warranted to understand the
broader meanings these terms have in the context of testing for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2
and other contexts.
Responses on the sliding scale of future risk showed a high variability and were largely
unexplained by the experimental intervention or other variables measured. This may point to
considerable uncertainty in the public as to how to interpret test results. It also likely reflects
the well-described tendency of people to use a 50% response to indicate uncertainty rather
than a true judgement of probability (18). We also saw that about a quarter of respondents on
the first question stated their risk was “average” or “higher”. This may point to considerable
uncertainty in the public as to how to interpret test results Use of the top end of the scale is
hard to interpret but may either reflect a failure to read the information carefully and

therefore a misunderstanding of the meaning of the result, or participants’ using information
beyond the experiment to assess their risk and not adequately considering the hypothetical
test result when making their response.
While we found no evidence for a direct effect on protective behaviours of the terms used to
describe antibody tests results, there was indirect evidence that perceiving no risk of future
infection might reduce frequency of handwashing. This finding is tentative, given it is based
on behavioural intentions in response to a hypothetical antibody-positive result. Nonetheless
the potential for antibody testing to increase viral transmission must be considered alongside
the potential benefits the tests might have in allowing the easing of lockdown restrictions.
Clear communication about the ongoing need for handwashing, in particular, will be essential
and raising public awareness of the main mechanisms through which SARS-CoV-2 is
transmitted – through air and surfaces – might help improve adherence. This, in addition to
acknowledgment of the imperfect nature of the tests, will give the public a more accurate
representation of the meaning and implications of an antibody test result and a better
understanding of how to reduce the risk of transmission. Such communications need to
emphasise that transmission can occur through contact regardless of antibody status. Such
communications also need to be rigorously evaluated to ensure their effectiveness at
communicating these points both to those undergoing antibody tests as well as to general
populations that are now having to learn to live with SARS-CoV-2.
Strengths and Limitations
This study provides the first experimental evidence for the potentially adverse impact on risk
perceptions and protective behaviours of commonly used terms to describe SARS-CoV-2
antibody tests and their results. As such, it provides timely evidence to inform policy and
research to mitigate these effects to realise the potential benefits of such tests.
The study has several limitations. First, participants were responding to a hypothetical test
and asked to imagine that they had received a test result that had detected antibodies.
Findings from such studies can generalise to clinical settings (19,20) but some caution is
warranted.
Second, the protective behaviours of handwashing and physical distancing were measured
using single items assessing behavioural intentions following a hypothetical test result.
Third, the sample size was insufficient to detect effect sizes that could be important at a
population level. It is possible, for example, that the use of the terms Certificate or Passport
might impact on risk perception, but the current study lacked the power to detect this.
Fourth, while quotas were used to achieve a sample broadly representative of the UK
population, research panels are not representative of the general population (21,22). We
found no evidence that the impact of the interventions in this study was modified by
demographic characteristics of the participants, providing some reassurance about the
generalisability of results across age groups, gender, educational level and geographical
region of the UK.

Implications for research and policy
The results of this study have several implications for research and policy. The effectiveness
of antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will depend not only on the extent and duration of any
immunity conferred and the performance of a test, but also upon a good understanding of the
meaning of tests results among those offered them. First, the use of the term Immunity should
be avoided in phrases to describe antibody tests, whether described as Passports, Certificates
or Tests. Second, research is needed to evaluate different ways of informing those offered
tests and receiving tests results to minimise the proportion erroneously perceiving an
antibody-positive test result to mean no risk of becoming infected with the virus. It should
also focus on maximising understanding that – regardless of antibody-status – anyone can
indirectly transmit the virus by touching a contaminated surface and infecting the next
surface they touch. Hand washing or sanitising therefore need to remain frequent. Research is
also needed with those undergoing actual tests, powered to detect effects judged meaningful
in the context of a population-based testing programme and involving measures of actual
behaviour.
Conclusion
Interest in SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is high – across many countries, employers and
populations. While such testing could contribute to wider strategies to ease lock-down
restrictions, their use may have an adverse impact on transmission-related behaviour. This
appears to vary with the way the tests are described. Using the term Immunity (vs Antibody)
to describe antibody tests increases the proportion of people believing that an antibodypositive result means they have no future risk of coronavirus, a perception that may be
associated with less frequent handwashing and hence increased risk of transmission.
