Abstract
Public health control strategies, such as lockdown, seem to be effective in reducing the
spread of the pandemic, but are ineffective as a whole since lockdown is responsible of
global economic crisis and badly lived by the majority of children and adults who have
developed mental health disorders and familial problems as well. Thus, the development of
a vaccine against COVID-19 is needed to control this disease. We have developed a discrete
age-structured model and followed the Moroccan vaccination program to assess the impact
of booster vaccination targeting Moroccan adults against COVID-19. Using the derived
model, we estimated some relevant model parameters related to COVID-19 using collected
cumulative mortality and reported Moroccan data. A control reproduction number Rc ,
which determines the necessary level of vaccine uptake that lead to COVID-19 eradication
is determined. Furthermore, a herd immunity threshold above which the population can be
protected from COVID-19 infection is derived. Analyzing the model, sufficient and necessary
conditions for the eradication of the disease are obtained as well. Next, we perform numerical
simulations to study the impact of several uptake levels of the potential vaccine on the
persistence and the extinction of COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that the COVID-19
is expected to last past 2021 in the absence of a vaccination program. Moreover, a vaccination
of the adult population at rate 0.6% per day needs at least 67% of vaccine efficacy and 90% of
immunogenicity rate to eradicate the disease. Using Sinopharm vaccine, the herd immunity
can be achieved when about half of Moroccan adult population is immunized against the
COVID-19. However, using Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, less than 60% of adult population
must be immunized against the disease to achieve the herd immunity. Finally, if vaccine
efficacy is about 80% and the immunogenicity is about 50% then vaccinating adults at rate
of 0.6% per day could protect roughly 22% of children from COVID-19 infection.
1. Introduction
The newly emerging coronavirus diseases become constant threats to global public health
[50]. There are seven coronaviruses (CoVs) known to infect humans so far [63]. Among
them, three have caused more severe respiratory illness and fatalities including SARS-CoV,

MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [50]. Over the two past decades, they were responsible for
three major coronaviruses outbreaks. Indeed, in November 2002, the first case of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in Guangdong, China. The disease has reached pandemic by July 2003 and mysteriously disappeared in the same year with a total of 8,096
reported cases, including 774 deaths in 27 countries [43]. Ten years later, the Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in Saudi Arabia and caused an epidemic in the Middle East. Between April 2012 and December 2019, there have been 2499 confirmed cases
of MERS and 858 deaths in 27 countries [23, 35]. The most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the last coronaviruses which probably emerged in
China in December 2019 and continues to progress to date [18, 56]. Although less lethal
than SARS and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible and, the so-called COVID-19
disease, reached a pandemic status in mid-March 2020 [50, 18, 10]. Affecting 218 countries
and territories around the world, it is responsible actually of more than 61 million cases of
infection and 1.4 million deaths globally. Furthermore, despite the public health measures
taken to control the disease spread, the world is facing an unprecedented economic crisis and
the vaccination becomes the only hope to eradicate the COVID-19 and to allow people to
return to normal life [39]. An effective COVID-19 vaccine must provide a strong and long
term protective antibody response [11]. Unfortunately, until the end of 2020, there were
no vaccine approved against any Human coronaviruses. In the past, several vaccine candidates for SARS and MERS have been under development but the research program has been
shelved because of three reasons [2, 13]. First of all, the natural extinction of SARS-CoV
occurred before the process of vaccine development was completed. Secondly, there was no
enough financial support for vaccine development, and, finally, the market size deemed to be
too small by the large pharmaceutical companies [56, 6]. However, due to the great genetic
similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the acquired knowledge is now very useful
for COVID-19 vaccine development [55]. Different technology platforms are performed including both traditional (i.e. inactivated virus, live attenuated virus and protein/adjuvant)
and novel approaches (i.e. viral vectors and nucleic acids) [29, 52, 47]. Furthermore, supported by WHO and partners, several pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions
worldwide joined their effort to produce a safe and effective vaccine as soon as possible in
early 2021 [47, 59, 64]. This constitutes a real challenge as vaccine development process
takes more than a decade [15]. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the internationally race for
COVID-19 vaccines started shortly after first sequencing of its complete genome by China in
January, 2020 [22]. Currently, at least 151 vaccine candidates are in preclinical evaluation,
and about 48 are in clinical evaluation for which a dozen are available or nearing the final
stage of testing [60, 37, 47]. Once approved, the WHO and partners will guarantee access
to these vaccines worldwide though the COVAX program in order to cover 20 of the world’s
population [60, 61]. Health workers and vulnerable people will be prioritized. Additional
doses of vaccine may be provided if the epidemiological situation of country so requires [61].
Morocco is one of the countries hitted by COVID-19 with a total of 428193 confirmed cases
and 7170 deaths as of December 26th; 2020; [48]. The Moroccan government decided then

to be among the countries to conduct a mass emergency vaccination campaign against the
COVID-19. Since the end of December 2020, the Moroccan Kingdom intends to launch an
emergency vaccination program for the adult population upon immediate receipt of the first
pre-ordered doses of vaccines from the Sinopharm or Astrazeneca companies. It will cover
80% of the population aged over 18 years old. The program will be conducted over a period
of 12 weeks in which people will receive two doses of vaccine separated by 21 days in average.
Mathematical modeling has proven to be a powerful tool to predict the dynamics of the
epidemic and to help decision makers to evaluate the effectiveness of public health control
interventions (See [31, 38, 53, 19] and references therein). Furthermore, mathematical models
can be used to assess whether a vaccination strategy will be effective in eradicating or
controlling a disease. Using a mathematical model of COVID-19 vaccine portfolio in [34],
McDonnell et al. estimated timelines and probabilities of success of COVID-19 vaccines.
Their results suggests that, by the end of April 2021, there is a 50% of chance that a safe
and efficient vaccine can be approved by the end of 2021. Furthermore, it could take more
than a year to produce sufficient vaccines to cover 50 million medical staff in the entire
world. In [26], Peter Jentsch et al. developed an age-structured SEAIR model of COVID-19
with vaccination in Ontario to check whether it is better to vaccinate the most vulnerable
individuals or those who spread the virus further to others. They found that using vaccines
to break the spread could minimize mortality impressively than using the vaccines selecting
elderly people. Tom Britton et al. in [7] developed an age-structured mathematical model
according to social activity level. They estimated that if the basic reproduction number
reaches 2.5, then the disease-induced herd immunity level could reach 43%, which is lower
than the classical herd immunity level. Mukandavire et al. used a mathematical model fitted
to COVID-19 daily new cases in South Africa to estimate the critical vaccination coverage
that control the disease for different vaccine efficacy levels. They estimated that a vaccine
with 70% efficacy can eradicate COVID-19 disease in south Africa [36]. In [17], Enahoro
A. et al. used of a mathematical model to evaluate the effect of an imperfect COVID-19
vaccine on the eradication of COVID-19 disease in the United States. Their study suggests
that the likelihood of COVID-19 eradication in the United States can be highly improved if
the vaccination is accompanied with non pharmaceutical measures.
In this work, we develop a discrete age-structured model with a booster vaccination,
focusing on an established path of COVID-19 transmission from children to adults and
vice versa. In other words, we present a model, splitting the population into two different
cohorts, to focus our investigation on a vaccination program targeting adults aged over 18
years. Since the developed COVID-19 vaccine may not always hold when carried out to the
patient and doesn’t always protect against infection [21, 27], our model will include varying
efficacies and immunogenecities of the vaccine against COVID-19. The model is a useful
tool, which will be used to assess the vaccination rate, efficacy and the immunogenicity of
vaccine needed to eradicate the COVID-19 according to the intended strategy followed by
the Moroccan Government.

2. Method
2.1. Data collection
The data of reported symptomatic infectious and death cases is collected each day at
11 pm from the official Coronavirus Portal of Morocco [48]. Data information, as shown in
Fig. 2.2 and Fig. 2.1 covers the cumulative number of reported cases and death cases from
March 2nd to December 26th, 2020.

vaccination between March 2nd, 2020 and December 26th, 2020.

Figure 2.2: COVID-19 mortality data and fitting results in Morocco using model (2.1) in the absence of
vaccination between March 2nd, 2020 and December 26th, 2020.

2.2. Model formulation
The population considered in this section is stratified into two age categories and eight
disease status. Individuals are classified as unvaccinated susceptible children (Tu ), unvaccinated susceptible adults (Su ), vaccinated susceptible adults (Sv ), asymptomatic infectious
adults (A), asymptomatic infectious children (B), unreported symptomatic infectious (Iu ),
hospitalized symptomatic infectious (H), recovered individuals (R) and COVID-deceased
individuals (D). We assume that infected children do not show symptoms and can still
transmit the disease. COVID-19 disease dynamics can be described as follows: Susceptible
children are born at rate πT and move to the susceptible adult class at rate α. Unvaccinated susceptible individuals that are vaccinated at rate p and acquire immunity from the
vaccine at rate  move to the vaccinated class (Sv ) . It is assumed that vaccination does

not necessarily induce lifelong immunity. Thus, vaccinated susceptible individuals are also
assumed to acquire COVID-19 infection with a protective efficacy ψ, following effective contact with asymptomatic or unreported infected individuals. Furthermore, it is assumed
that vaccinated class (Sv ) receives a booster dose as a second administration of the vaccine, at a rate φ, to maintain successful immunization. Unvaccinated susceptible adults (Su )
(resp. vaccinated susceptible adults (Sv ), susceptible children (T )) are infected through contact with infectious adults (A + Iu ) at a transmission rate βaa (resp. (1 − ψ) βaa , βca ) or
through contact with infectious children (B) at a transmission rate βac (resp. (1 − ψ) βac ,
βcc ). Once infected, children and adults move, respectively, to the asymptomatic infectious
class (B) and the asymptomatic infectious class (A). After an average period 1/δ days the
asymptomatic infectious individuals (A) become symptomatic and proceed either to the unreported symptomatic infectious (Iu ), at rate δ1 , or to the hospitalized individual (H) at rate
δ2 with δ = δ1 +δ2 . Once becoming symptomatic, individuals of class Iu and H either remain
asymptomatic for 1/µ days on average before they are recovered or remain asymptomatic
for 1/d days on average before they are dead due to infection. Asymptomatic children can
either be recovered without being hospitalized at rate δ or detected and hospitalized at rate
σ. All individuals are naturally dead at rate dN . The model will be given by the following

and  = 0. Note that the first infected child under 18 years was reported 22 days since the
beginning of the epidemic. Furthermore, the maximum asymptomatic duration is assumed to

accelerates rapidly with time. Hence, we will use exponential regression with 95% of confidence level to find an exponential function that best fits the data, from March 2nd to June
10th. Using SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) we found that the
exponential model, given by beat where a = 0.263 with confidence interval CI (0.229 − 0.297)

Since the initial susceptible population is not dramatically affected in the early phase
of the epidemic, we will assume that Su (t) ≈ Su (0). Let S0 := Su (0), A0 := A(0) and
I0 := Iu (0). From the fifth equation of system (2.1) and using (2.2) we obtain
Iu (t) = I0 eat ,
where
I0 =

(2.3)

ba a + δ + d + dN − βaa Su (0)
.
δ2
βaa Su (0)

Now, using formulas (2.3) and the sixth equation of system (2.1), we obtain after simplification
aI0 = δ1 A0 − (µ + d + dN )I0 .
It follows that
I0 =

δ1
A0 .
a + µ + d + dN

Furthermore, Sv (0) = 0, Tu (0) = 12437000 and Su (0) = 23428191. We calculate the leaving
rate of children under 18 years old to adults as 1/α = 18 × 365 days, thus, α = 1, 52 × 10−4 .
Since the Moroccan authorities decided to give the second dose of the vaccine after 21 days
following the first dose then we assume that φ = 1/21. As mentioned in Section 1, we assume
that βac = βaa and βca = βcc . To estimate the transmission rates, βaa , βcc and d, we use the
nonlinear least squares solver “lsqcurvefit” in MATLAB R2019b software. The values of the
estimated parameters are summarized in Table 1.
3. Results
Since the three last components H,R and D do not appear in the six first equations of
model (2.1) then we will focus our local stability study on the following system.

It is obvious that the model (3.1) has a unique disease free equilibrium (DFE) which is given

3.1. Control reproduction number
The control reproduction number, Rc , is an important value, used to determine whether
a control policy, such as lockdown, lifting, behavioral practices, vaccination, etc, will be
efficient to decrease the number of secondary infections to be less than one. In the absence
of any control, this number is considered as the basic reproduction number, R0 , which is the
average number of secondary infections produced when one infectious individual is introduced
into a host susceptible population. This quantity determines whether a given disease may
spread, or die out in a population. Applying the next generation matrix method formulated
in [51], Rc can be given by

The local behavior of the DFE of system (3.1) is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 1. The disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable for Rc < 1 and
unstable for Rc > 1.

prove the global stability of the DFE.

Theorem 3. Assume that Θ < 1 and Rc ≤ 1 , then the disease free equilibrium E of system
((3.1)) is globally asymptotically stable in the region Ω, i.e,
lim (Tu , B, Su , Sv , A, Iu ) = (Tu , 0, Su , Sv , 0, 0).

t→∞

The proof of Theorem 3 can be found in Appendix D.
Remark 4. Using parameter values in Table 3 and varying the vaccine efficacy values,
ψ, in the range [0, 1], one can show that the parameter values of Θ vary in the range
[−0.9799, −0.9788]. It follows that, in order to assure the global asymptotic stability, it
suffices to assume that Rc ≤ 1.
3.3. Herd immunity
Herd immunity is defined as a level of population immunity at which the amount of
virus able to spread in the entire population becomes very low so that the spread of the
disease will be over. However, if the immunity level does not reach the herd immunity level,
then a second wave of disease spread may appear. Thus, it is an interesting to look when
herd immunity can be reached. Although natural herd immunity is considered as a way
to reach herd immunity through natural recovery from COVID-19 infection, vaccination is
considered as the best way to protect susceptible individuals and their community. Indeed,
once plenty individuals are vaccinated and get immune from the disease, viruses cannot pass
between individuals in the population and the whole community is less probably to contract
the disease.
Note that the quantity ϕ, given in (A.1), can be written as
ϕ = Su + (1 − ψ) Sv .

Note that, following Theorem 3 and Remark 4, the disease free equilibrium E of system
((3.1)) is globally asymptotically stable if Rc < 1. Furthermore, Rc < 1 if and only if
hv > hcv and, thus, for the herd immunity to be achieved, a proportion hcv , which is known as
the herd immunity threshold, of the entire population should be vaccinated. Furthermore, if
the vaccination is not successful at all (ψ = 0) then no matter the proportion of vaccinated
adults, the eradication of the COVID-19 disease is implausible.
4. Simulations and discussion
The vaccination is among the most effective methods of preventing disease, disability,
and death. A vaccine is defined as a suspension of live attenuated or inactivated pathogens,
or fractions thereof, which is administered to induce immunity and prevent infectious disease or its sequelae [46]. Throughout 2020, a global effort have been undertaken to produce
safe and effective vaccines against the newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Actually,
several of them received approval to initiate the national and multi-country mass vaccination campaigns. Morocco also will launch an emergency vaccination program for the adult
population using vaccines produced by pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm and Astrazeneca.
Over a period of 3 months, susceptible adult people who volunteer for the vaccination will
receive two injections of vaccine spaced by 21 days apart [49]. Generally, the first dose
induces a primary immune response by exposing the body for the first time to antigens.
This immune response is often slow, limited and do not lead to protective immunity [45].
Therefore, a subsequent dose, also called a booster shot, is required to induce a secondary
immune response in order to maintain an immunological memory which provides a long-time
immunity. Indeed, the long-lived antibodies and memory cells have the ability to respond
faster and more efficiently to the re-exposure to the same antigens [1]. Unfortunately, it is
still too early to assess the duration of immunity provided by all anti-COVID-19 vaccines
[3, 9]. Moreover, our understanding to the magnitude and duration of the immune response
to natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains limited to date [12]. But it is well known
that, for the common coronaviruses, the protective immunity is short-lasting and the reinfection often occurs 12 months after infection [8, 16]. For the SARS-CoV-2, several studies
have shown that the immunity wanes over time and can be maintained only for few months
after infection [54, 25, 44, 14]. Furthermore, the report of many cases of secondary infections
with the COVID-19 in the same year also provides evidence that the acquired immunity is
short-lived [16]. In case the protective immunity, conferred by the infection, is transient like
for the coronavirus diseases, it will be necessary to plan periodic vaccination campaigns in
coming years to prevent future outbreaks [40, 12].
In this study, we used a discrete age-structured mathematical model to assess the SARSCoV-2 vaccination program adopted by Morocco incorporating the efficacy and immunogenicity of the used vaccine and the vaccination rate of adult population. The data used for

simulations include implicitly the effect of the NPI (i.e. wearing masks; social distancing;
cleaning and disinfecting measures. . . ) applied between March 2nd, 2020 and December
26th, 2020 on COVID-19 disease spread. Based on our results, the COVID-19 is likely to
persist past 2021 in the absence of a vaccine. Indeed, the number of daily reported cases
and deaths tend to decline slowly over time, reaching, respectively, a number of 800 and 10
cases per day by the end of 2021 (See Fig. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2).
However, although it takes many months, vaccinating adults could help to eradicate the
disease more quickly. The Moroccan people will have to wait until the second half of 2021
before definitively abandoning the NPI. Several studies have shown that when the NPI are
maintained during the vaccination program, the COVID-19 elimination is greatly improved
in the country such as the US and South Africa [24, 4, 36].

corresponds to ψ = 0.7 while the horizontal line corresponds to pS = 0.006.

Morocco, the efficacy and immunogenicity of the vaccine needed to eradicate the COVID-19
depend on the proportion of adults vaccinated daily. Indeed, if the Moroccan government
plans to immunize the adult population at a rate of 0.6% per day, then the used vaccine
must have an efficacy rate of at least 67% and generate a strong immunogenicity ( = 0.9) in
vaccinated individuals to achieve the disease eradication (Fig. 4.3). The use of UK’s OxfordAstrazeneca or China’s Sinopharm vaccine that have, respectively, a efficacy rate of 70% or
79% in vaccinating the adult population may be powerful tool in the COVID-19 eradication
while still maintaining the NPI [28]. However, although difficult to enact, if the Moroccan
health care is able to increase the vaccination rate to 1% per day, then vaccine has to have
at least 40% of efficacy to eradicate the disease (Fig. 4.3). So the success of the vaccination
program depends not only on the efficacy rate of vaccine and the degree of the generated
immune response but depends also on the logistical resources deployed to ensure vaccination
of large numbers of individuals within a short space of time. Paltiel and its collaborators
[41] also showed that the advantages of a vaccine can decline significantly in the event
of manufacturing or deployment delays, significant vaccine hesitancy, or greater epidemic
severity. Many pharmaceutical companies have taken up the challenge of supplying the world
with the first anti-COVID-19 vaccines at the end of 2020. However, they are now facing a new
challenge to produce a sufficient quantity of COVID-19 vaccines of high quality to cover the
demand of all emerging and non-emerging countries affected by this pandemic. According
to scientific news published by Cohen and Kupferschmidt in [12], it will be necessary to
wait for the year 2022 to assure enough vaccines available to vaccinate people wishing to
be vaccinated. Fortunately, reaching the so-called "herd immunity threshold" could have an
indirect effect on the protection of the unvaccinated susceptible people against the infection.
The notion of herd immunity threshold is defined as the proportion of immunized individuals,
through natural infection or through vaccination, in a population who cannot get infected
anymore [40]. Generally, although herd immunity threshold varies with each disease, a
large proportion of individuals must be immunized to achieve the herd immunity. For the

COVID-19, the herd immunity threshold is still unknown and will probably vary depending
on the community and the vaccination strategy adopted by the country in question among
others [62]. However, several studies using mathematical modeling were able to estimate
this threshold [24, 4, 36]. For example, by assuming a vaccine with 80% of efficacy, Iboi
and collaborators [24] found that at least 82% of susceptible population in US must be
immunized against the SARS-CoV-2 to achieve the herd immunity threshold. Moreover,
they also found that this percentage could drop to 72% (resp. 46%) with a regular wearing
of masks by the half of the population (resp. the entire population). In our case, the herd
immunity is achieved when about half of Moroccan adult population is immunized against
the COVID-19 with a vaccine efficacy rate of 79% like the one by Sinopharm vaccine (See
Figure 4.4). However, with an efficacy rate of 70% such as the case of Oxford-Astrazeneca
vaccine, less than 60% of adult population must be immunized against the disease to achieve
the herd immunity.

These proportions should probably be higher than estimated since our model also takes
into account the combined effects of the NPIs and vaccine.
Finally, note that COVID-19 vaccines obviously provide direct protection to adults but
can also produce indirect protection and block the course of infection to children. The
Fig. 4.5 shows that, if vaccine efficacy is about 80% and the immunogenicity is about 50%,
then protected susceptible children increases as vaccine uptake increases in the total adult
population. In particular, 0.6% of vaccinated adults could save about 22% of children from
infection.
5. Conclusion
While waiting for the first doses of vaccines since the end of December 2020, Morocco is
preparing for the vaccination campaign of the adult population to eradicate the COVID-19
epidemic. Our findings show that, with a vaccination rate of 0.6% per day, the vaccine must
both have an efficacy rate of at least 67% and must provide a high degree of immunity to
people vaccinated. In addition, it is also necessary to continue to take protective measures
during the vaccination period to achieve the herd immunity threshold more quickly. Our
results found that the herd immunity can be obtained by immunizing less than 60% of the
adult population against the COVID-19 with a vaccine with 70% or more of efficacy. Finally, this vaccination program can also protect 22% of susceptible children from infection.
However, in order not to devalue the efficacy of the vaccine used and before starting vaccination campaign, the Moroccan government must ensure the availability of all doses of
vaccine needed to cover the entire target population, encourage the concerned people to be
vaccinated, and carry out all vaccinations in the shortest time in accordance with the human,
logistical and financial resources of country.

Then −(dN + φ), − (pS ε + dN ), − (dN + α) are roots of the characteristic equation (B.1) and,
consequently, a necessary and sufficient condition for the other roots ta have negative real

Thus, if Rc < 1 then α1 and α3 are positive. Now let’s prove that α1 α2 − α3 > 0. After few
simplification we can get

(µ + d + dN )α2 − α3 = −

and, consequently,
(µ+d+dN )α2 −α3 > (δ+d+dN ) ((µ + d + dN )(σ + δ2 + dN + α) + δ1 (σ + δ + dN + α)) > 0.
Furthermore, from ((B.2)), we have α1 > µ + d + dN . Then, α1 α2 > (µ + d + dN )α2 > α3 .
Finally, we have α1 α2 − α3 > 0. Hence, E is locally asymptotically stable for Rc < 1.
Assume now that Rc > 1. Since
P (0) = (dN + α) (dN + φ)(pS ε + dN )(σ + δ + dN + α)(δ + d + dN )(µ + d + dN )(1 − Rc ),
then P (0) < 0. Moreover, when λ ∈ R then lim P (λ) = +∞ , Then, there exists λ0 > 0
λ→+∞

such that P (λ0 ) = 0 and the disease-free equilibrium becomes unstable. This completes the
proof.
Appendix C
For the invariance property it suffices to show that the vector field, on the boundary,
does not point to the exterior. On one hand, on the boundary of Ω, we have
M (t) := Tu (t) + B(t) + Su (t) + Sv (t) + A(t) + Iu (t) =

πT
.

Then
dM
= πT − dN M − (σ + δ) B(t) − φSv (t) − (δ2 + d) A(t) − (µ + d) Iu (t)
dt
dM
≤ 0. Therefore, solutions starting from Ω, will remain there for
dt
πT
t ≥ 0. On the other hand, we have lim supM (t) ≤
. Hence, Ω is attracting, that is, all
t→∞
dN
solutions of ((3.1)) eventually enters Ω. This completes the proof.

and, consequently,

Appendix D

Consequently Ẇ < 0 whenever Θ < 1. Furthermore, Ẇ = 0 implies that (1 − Θ) A ≤ 0. It
follows that A = 0 and, thus, the fifth equation of system ((3.1)) becomes
αB + Su (βaa Iu + βca B) + (1 − ψ)Sv (βaa Iu + βca B) = 0.
Then B = Iu = 0 and, consequently, {Ẇ = 0} ⊆ {A = B = Iu = 0}. It follows that the
maximum invariant set contained in {Ẇ = 0} is the set {A = B = Iu = 0}. Any solution
start from the set {A = B = Iu = 0} must satisfies

Therefore, applying the LaSalle–Lyapunov Invariance Principal, it follows that E is globally
