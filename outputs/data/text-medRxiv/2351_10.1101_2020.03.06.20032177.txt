ABSTRACT
Understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is crucial for evaluating its
spread pattern, especially in metropolitan areas of China, as its spread can lead to
secondary outbreaks outside Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus disease
outbreak. In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the
potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities
outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to
February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections
in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and
increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of
the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began
January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps
app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the
quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of
reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was
2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on
the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the

prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For
example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with
a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different
levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the
estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the
peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that
public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that
more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further
spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to
normal before the end of the epidemic. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons
learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other
metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus 2019 novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) and the novel virus severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), which has attracted worldwide attention. The new
coronavirus is a strain that has never been found in humans before. This virus can
cause an acute respiratory disease, and common signs of infection include respiratory
symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. In more severe cases,
infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and
even death(2020b).
According to WHO situation reports, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to
79407 confirmed cases worldwide and 2622 deaths in 32 countries as of February 24,
2020, of which 64287 were from Hubei, China. Numerous cases have been reported
in other areas outside Hubei, including metropolitan areas of Beijing (n=399) and
Shanghai (n=335) inside China, as well as other countries outside China, such as
South Korea (n=833), Japan (n=144), and Italy (n=124). With the continuously
increasing number of cases, understanding the spread pattern of COVID-19 and
monitoring spikes in the number of cases are crucial steps to provide evidence that
can guide public health intervention strategies and healthcare policy making.

Several mathematical models and data analysis approaches attempting to
estimate the transmission of COVID-19 have been recently reported(Hermanowicz,
2020;Imai et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2020a). Public health interventions and
transportation restriction effects for disease transmission have also been evaluated in
some studies(Tang et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020). Some studies indicated that public
intervention measures greatly mitigate the final size of the epidemic, and shift the
turning point about 24 days before the turning point without these measures(Liu et al.,
2020b). Some noted that travel restrictions would not affect much unless combined
with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community(Chinazzi et al.,
2020). And a report from Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team concluded that
the intensive intervention or something equivalently effective, such as combining
home isolation of suspect cases, home quarantine of those living in the same
household as suspect cases, and social distancing of the elderly and others at most risk
of severe disease, could reduce transmission; however, it will need to be maintained
until a vaccine becomes available, and the team also predicted that transmission will
quickly rebound if interventions are relaxed so it requires multiple interventions to be
combined to have a substantial impact on transmission(Ferguson et al., 2020). Besides,
to predict the outbreak size and time, researchers have published many different
results for forecasting when the outbreak will peak in different areas(Read et al.,
2020;Wu et al., 2020). These models are certainly useful to understand the emerging
trends of COVID-19. However, there are several challenges to such timely analyses
and forecasting. Due to barriers, such as the disease incubation period, asymptomatic
infection, diagnosis testing capacity, overloaded medical staff and complicated
reporting processes, there can be a delay or missed reporting in this evolving situation
regarding the confirmation of cases. Furthermore, the adopted models have mostly
been complicated with many pre-settings or assumptions or parameter values that are
likely not accurate. Although some modeling approaches can estimate parameter
values through statistical methods, they can only contribute a rough simulation for the
modeling. As a result, those studies achieved different prediction results by using
different methods and datasets.
To achieve a relatively objective judgment, given that that this new disease and
complicated situation has many unknown factors, we used mathematical modeling
methods to characterize COVID-19 transmission and used multiple datasets for
ensuring the data reliability. Since individual data sources may be biased or
incomplete, according to related studies, the use of multiple data sources rather than a
single dataset can enable a more robust estimation of the underlying dynamics of
transmission(Funk and Eggo). Therefore, we investigated and collected data from

four sources, including released data and official daily reports from commercial
technology companies, academic institutes, authorities or local healthcare
commissions, and the World Health Organization, to minimize the resulting errors
caused by potentially biased single data sources. The data were obtained from the
Beijing Municipal Health Commission (BMHC)(Decker, 2010), Shanghai Municipal
Health and Family Planning Commission (SMHFPC)(2020e), Health Commission of
Guangdong Province(2020c), National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC)(2020d),

and Engineering (CSSE) of Johns Hopkins University(Dong et al., 2020), and WHO

reports(Organization,

2020c).

Considering that the cases detected in these four cities were all imported and
secondary transmission cases, and based on the reported data available after January
20, 2020, Chinese authorities have implemented prevention measures in these cities to
contain the outbreak and prevent the disease from spreading; thus, we considered the
secondary transmission pattern of COVID-2019 to be different than the early spread
pattern in Wuhan, where the virus was rampantly transmitted without any prevention
measures. Therefore, we collected data from January 24, 2020 (Chinese New Year’s
Eve) to February 23, 2020 to give an overall objective estimation of COVID-19
development in 4 high-risk metropolitan areas of China: Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We estimated how COVID-19 human-to-human
transmission occurred in these large cities, which have developed considerable cases.
We further used these estimates to forecast the potential risks and development trends
of these four metropolitan areas inside China.

Methods
To evaluate the COVID-19 spread pattern and estimate its transmission in 4
metropolitan areas, we used an adjusted SEIR model with data. We only considered
human-to-human transmission in our models.
Adjusted SEIR model for COVID-19

The SEIR model is a deterministic metapopulation transmission model in which the

population is divided into four classes: S (susceptible people who are likely to be
infected), E (exposed, people who are exposed), I (infectious, people who are infected)
and R (removed, recovered and dead persons). We assumed that the epidemic risk

started with infectious cases on February 3, 2020, when authorities announced that
people were returning to work after the Chinese Spring Festival holiday. Therefore,
we modeled a period beginning on February 3, 2020. The SEIR model state transition
is shown in Figure 5. In our estimation, the entire population was initially susceptible
since COVID-19 is an emerging new infectious disease and not all people have
immunity against it. In January (before Chinese New Year)

，there were estimated

3.246, 2.847, 3.430, 3.271 million people flow out from Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Shenzhen, respectively. We took this outflow number out from these
four cities initial population and assume they inflow back after Chinese New Year by
February 17, 2020. We estimated the initial exposed population using number of
confirmed cases during the next 7 days. We assumed that the median incubation
period was 5-6 days (ranging from 0-14 days) based on the WHO report(Organization,
2020a).
Based on the basic SEIR model, we further considered the influence of multiple
factors on the transmission pattern as the situation unfolded, including public health
intervention measures, people’s self-protection behaviors, the diagnosis rate,
population flow, etc.
Assuming that public health interventions contributed to the control of the
dynamics of the epidemic, we incorporated an parameter that indicates the changes in
the population flow into the model. According to the inflow index, outflow index and
urban daily adjusted index of the travel intensity from the Baidu Migration Big Data
Platform, for the period from January 24, 2020 to February 23, 2020, we inferred that
the people’s activity was obviously lower than the normal level for the same period
last year. Furthermore, considering the Spring Festival population flow and those
returning to work after the holiday (officially announced as February 3, 2020), we
regarded that the risk for these 4 metropolitan areas grows with the inflow population
increase starting on February 3, 2020, an average introduced number of cases were
counted into the model.
We also estimated the parameter values within these cities using the MCMC
method. Cases in the reported data and other sources reported between January 24,
2020 and February 23, 2020 were used to adjust the model. Considering the possible
complex influencing factors, we proposed an adjusted SEIR model for COVID-19
estimation, as displayed in Figure 6.
In the adjusted SEIR model, we considered the inflow of the city’s population, so
the total number of people was not fixed, and the population was divided into seven

The MCMC method is a commonly used algorithm in modern statistical calculations.
This algorithm provides an effective tool for establishing statistical models and is

sampling(Hastings, 1970), with a normal distribution as the recommended distribution,
estimated the parameters of the modified SEIR model, to obtain the baseline
estimation of parameters, and incorporated the data collected from infectious disease
reports into the above statistical inference, and simulated the process of infectious
disease transmission to further fix some parameters on the basis of fitting reported
data. Using Beijing as an example, the parameter estimates and initial values of the
SEIR model are listed in Table 3.
In addition, to simulate the contact rate for model estimation, we used urban
travel index data from Baidu, a major internet company in China that hosts the
popular navigator app Baidu Maps, which indirectly monitors the real-time urban
travel intensity and population flow. The Baidu index of travel intensity and
population flow was converted into the corresponding coefficients for the contact rate
and the quarantined susceptible population. In terms of Baidu index, we simulated
people’s activity level by comparing our observed period (under strict interventions)
with normal level in same period last year, we also consider the assumption scenario
that when people returning back to work (limited interventions), accordingly, we
added the coefficients (0.6c, 0.8c, c, 1.5c, 2c) for the baseline contact rate to compare
different effectiveness of interventions. Similarly, the coefficients were added to
baseline quarantine proportion (0.6q, 0.8q, q, 1.5q, 2q).

Basic reproduction number R0 estimates
At the onset, when all people are susceptible, R0 is defined as the average number of
new infections directly caused by a case in a population of people who are all
susceptible. Given the model structure includes quarantine and isolation, we used the
next generation matrix to derive a formula for the basic reproduction number after
public health interventions were executed, the principal eigenvalue of the next
generation matrix is the expectation of population growth and the equation is as
follows and the parameter definition is same with adjusted SEIR model.

Results
Data Characterization
To characterize the overall epidemic size and dynamics, Figure 1 shows the
epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases identified in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and
Shenzhen from January 24, 2020 to February 23, 2020.
Adjusted SEIR Model Estimation
We summarized and interpreted the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the 4
municipal areas. The adjusted SEIR model was used to predict cases in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and Figure 2 shows the comparisons between
the predicted results and actual results. The results are based on an assumption of no
further imported cases to these cities since China implemented strong regulation
measures during the observation period.
Based on our observations from the data shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 below, we
also found that the number of infected individuals changed with different levels of
public health interventions and that strict interventions could decrease the peak
number of infected individuals compared with the scenario of weak interventions;
accordingly, we used different contact rates to reflect the different levels of
interventions. The baseline contact rate was derived by the MCMC method, and the
results show that reducing the contact rate persistently decreased the peak value or
could delay the peak. In addition, with strict public intervention, the number of
infected individuals eventually decreased and the peak appeared sooner than it would
with weak intervention methods. After February 3, 2020, as people returned to work
after a holiday, many people returned to these cities, which was inferred from the
Baidu transportation index. We added this information into the risk factors for the
contact rate (1.5c, 2c). Accordingly, the number of infected individuals increased
compared with the scenario of a decreased contact rate (0.8c, 0.6c).
In addition, we compared the transmission dynamics with different quarantined
proportion of exposed individuals, which reflects the contact tracing capability and
management efforts of local governments, and the results show that reducing the
quarantined proportion of exposed individuals (0.8q, 0.6q) led to an increase in the
peak value and delayed the peak time. Conversely, the peak value decreased and an
earlier peak time occurred with a higher quarantined proportion of exposed
individuals (2q, 1.5q).

We used the MCMC method to fit the model and adopted an adaptive MH algorithm
to carry out the MCMC procedure. As a result, we inferred R0= 2.91, 2.78, 2.02, and
1.75 for Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, respectively.

Discussions
Our analysis results strongly demonstrate that reducing secondary infections among
close contacts would effectively limit human-to-human transmission, and public
health measures, such as the rapid identification of cases, tracing and following up
with people who had contact with an infected person, infection prevention and control
in health care settings, and the implementation of health measures for travelers, can
greatly prevented further spread of the disease.
The documented COVID-19 reproduction numbers range from 2.0 to 4.9(Shen et
al., 2020;Wu et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020), which are based on cases that developed
during different transmission phases and in different areas. For instance, the R0 in
Wuhan was obviously higher than that in other cities outside Wuhan during the
timeframe analyzed. Furthermore, after implementing the prevention measures
employed by the Chinese government and local authorities, we regarded the inferred
R0 results of the four cities as reasonable and interpretable.
In this study, we aimed to monitor COVID-19 trends after cases were imported
into other cities and countries and estimate the spread pattern by mathematical
modeling, which can be helpful for evaluating the potential risk and severity of new
outbreaks. The results of our study show that, for four metropolitan areas of China,
the containment measures were effective control at that time; however, it is
imperative to raise awareness in the population and prevent potential outbreak risks
any time. The study has limitations. The present reported data are insufficient to
understand the full epidemiological pattern of COVID-19 transmission and new
potential outbreaks. For example, the estimates in this manuscript have a certain
extent of uncertainty and delays due to the limitations in reporting mechanisms over
the course of the natural history of the cases, the impact of other potential
asymptomatic cases and some unreported cases. Some studies conducted assumption
that a small fraction, 20%, were not reported(Liu et al., 2020b) and others reported the
estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9%(Mizumoto et al., 2020) or 60%(Qiu,

.

2020) Evidently, such asymptomatic infectious cases are not fully reported by
authorities. However, some studies suggested crowdsourced data could be compiled

and analyzed as an complementation of officially released data, this perhaps help
improving the analysis results(Arbia, 2020;Leung and Leung, 2020;Sun et al., 2020).
In the future, we will evaluate how will the number of unreported cases influence the
severity of the epidemic and consider involving these unreported data to our

mathematical model

As concluded from the WHO-China Joint Mission report(Organization), the
COVID-19 transmission dynamics are inherently contextual, as are the dynamics for
any outbreak, and people worldwide need to work together to defend against this
disease, including 1) to enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19
outbreak in China and the nature and the impact of ongoing containment measures; 2)
to share knowledge on the COVID-19 response and preparedness measures being
implemented in countries affected by or at risk of importations of COVID-19; 3) to
generate recommendations for adjusting COVID-19 containment and response
measures in China and internationally; and 4) to establish priorities for a collaborative
program of work, research and development to address critical gaps in knowledge,
responses, readiness tools and strategies.
As a consequence of our study, we concluded that the outbreak could be greatly
reduced by strict public health interventions. The public intervention strategies and
implemented protection measures conducted in these four areas may help provide
epidemiological suggestions to governments that guide measures for the international
cases that are rapidly emerging.
