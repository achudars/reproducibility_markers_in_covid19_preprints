Abstract
Background - Tests are scarce resources, especially in low and middle-income countries, and the
optimization of testing programs during a pandemic is critical for the effectiveness of the disease control.
Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a regression model as a screening tool to
identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing.
Materials and Methods ‚Äì We applied machine learning techniques and provided a visualization of
potential regions with high densities of COVID-19 as a risk map. We performed a retrospective analysis
of individuals registered in "Dados do Bem", an app-based symptom tracker in use in Brazil.
Results ‚Äì From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the
app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive.
Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4 - 4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5 - 2.8]), and
shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model
obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users among the predicted as
negatives (NPV = 0.93). From the 287,714 users still not tested, our model estimated that only 34.5%
are potentially infected, thus reducing the need for extensive testing of all registered users. The model
was incorporated by the "Dados do Bem" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an
external validation in the state of Goias and found that of the 465 users selected, 52% tested positive.
Conclusions ‚Äì Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2
infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control
strategies.

Introduction
The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 requires extensive
testing programs to understand the transmission, diagnose, and isolate the positive cases. Given
the high mortality and absence of a specific consensual treatment or a reliable vaccine, large
testing programs are an essential part of epidemic control. The frequency of testing, however,
is very heterogeneous among countries. Brazil currently has the second-highest number of
COVID-19 cases, even with lower test rates (59,252 tests per one million inhabitants, as of
July 27, 2020)[1].
In a recent paper, Menni and colleagues[2] used information from an app-based
symptom tracker from UK and USA and concluded that the combination of symptoms could
be used as a screening tool to identify people with a possible positive result for COVID-19.
However, little is known about this association and their potential usage as a screening tool in
low- and medium-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil. Thus, our study aims to use the
combination of symptoms and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that
identifies people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We used data from an
app-based symptom tracker known as "Dados do Bem"[3], which is an initiative that started
available for the state of Rio de Janeiro, one of the centers of the outbreak in the country.
Applying our model, we can estimate the proportion of infected participants and then
categorize risk levels of infection within the geographical area of the state of Rio de Janeiro,
aiming to prioritize tests and optimize the testing program.

Materials and Methods
Study design and data source
This study is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from individuals
registered in the "Dados do Bem" app, which is a large Brazilian initiative that combines an
app-based symptom tracker and a public testing initiative for the users. The app interface and
the survey questions are provided as supporting information (S1 Fig).
The free smartphone application was launched in Brazil on April 28, 2020. Through a
short survey, it collects geo-referenced data from subscribed users, their demographic and
occupational characteristics, reported symptoms, as well as whether the participant is a health
professional or was in contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected person. The app then combines

the surveyed information and selects individuals for testing. The test used is the antibody
WondfoCOVID-19 IgM/IgG test (sensitivity = 86.43%, specificity = 99.57%) [4] and is
currently available only for the state of Rio de Janeiro.

Study population
We included participants registered through the smartphone app from its launch date
until July 16, 2020, separating them into two groups: those already selected and tested for the
antibody WondfoCOVID-19 IgM/IgG test, and those who responded to the questionnaire but
were not tested yet. The tests of the first group were performed in a location designated by the
app within the city of Rio de Janeiro. We excluded users whose test results were inconclusive.

Outcomes and variables
Our primary outcome was the test result (positive or negative) at the user level. Our
goal was to identify clinical manifestations and individual factors associated with positive
testing. Hence, we collected and assessed participant demographics (age, gender), nine
symptoms (loss of smell or anosmia, fever, myalgia, cough, nausea, shortness of breath,
diarrhea, coryza, and sore throat), and whether the user lives together with someone with a
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Statistical analysis
We described the characteristics and symptoms of positive and negative tested
participants, displaying the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and the
frequency for categorical variables. We then analyzed the individual association between
symptoms and the test result using a logistic regression model adjusted to age and gender. We
provided the corresponding Odds Ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval.
We aim to identify a combination of symptoms to build a prediction model for
determining a participant with SARS-CoV-2 infection. For that, we compared five different
machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression (stepwise), Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest,
Decision Tree (C 5.0), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. To address the imbalanced response

variable (only 11.8% are positive tests) during model training, we also evaluated four different
data balancing techniques (downsampling, upsampling, SMOTE, and ROSE).
The dataset was randomly divided into training and test sets (ratio: 80:20). During
model training, for each combination of machine learning and data balancing techniques, we
applied grid-search hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation, using the Area
Under the ROC Curve (AUC) as the target metric. We comparatively evaluated the models'
performance in the test set and selected the one with the highest Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC)[5] value. The cut-off point for predicted values was 50% (i.e., participants
with a probability higher than 50% were classified as "positive", and "negative" otherwise).
After our final model was incorporated by the "Dados do Bem" app, we performed an external
validation using data from users in the state of Goias.
Finally, we evaluated the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection risks over the
geographic area of the state of Rio de Janeiro modeled as a grid map (each grid is a 400m x
400m square area). Along with the participants with confirmed test results, we applied the
chosen model to the sample of participants that had not been tested to obtain their estimated
test result. We then calculated the proportion of estimated SARS-CoV-2 infections for each
grid according to Equation 1.

To avoid misinterpreting proportions in grids with scarce data, we considered grids
with at least 10 participants (~94% of all observations). Then, we evaluated the distribution of
the grid risks among all grids and classified them into five risk groups using the mean ¬± 0.5
and 1.5 standard deviations (SD) as thresholds: "very low" (< mean-1.5*SD), "low" (from
mean-1.5*SD to mean-0.5*SD), "medium" (from mean-0.5*SD to mean+0.5*SD), "high"
(from mean+0.5*SD to mean+1.5*SD), and "very high risk" (>mean+1.5*SD). Using this
classification, we built a risk map for the state of Rio de Janeiro.
All analyses were performed in R 3.6.3, using 'tidyverse' package for data wrangling
and plots; and 'caret' for the prediction models, with 'ranger' for Random Forest, 'C50' for
Decision Trees, 'xgbTree' for the eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and 'naivebayes' for the Na√Øve
Bayes model.

Results
Characteristics and self-reported symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection
From April 28, 2020, to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms
through the smartphone app. Of these, 49,721 users were already tested, from which 5,888
(11.8%) received a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to the self-reported information (Table 1), most participants were women
(61.9%), health professionals (55.8%), with a median age of 41 years old (IQR: 33-51). Among
those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, cough was the most frequent symptom
(59.6%), followed by myalgia (57.4%), coryza (56.3%), loss of smell/anosmia (52.9%), and
fever (44.8%). When evaluating the association between each symptom and the test result,
adjusted for age and gender (Fig 1), we found a similar result: loss of smell (odds ratio [OR]:
4.6; 95% CI: 4.4 - 4.9), fever (OR: 2.6; 95% CI: 2.5 - 2.8), and shortness of breath (OR: 2.1;
95% CI: 1.6 - 2.7) were associated with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Combination of symptoms and predictive modeling
Aiming to develop a model to predict positive participants based on the available
dataset, we ran 25 different scenarios, combining machine learning techniques and sampling
strategies. The logistic regression, gradient boosting and random forest techniques presented
the best median MCCs (0.25), followed by the decision tree, and na√Øve Bayes (see the
Supporting Information S2). Since the logistic regression model is more interpretable and
parsimonious, we chose it as the final model (Equation 2).

Regarding the classification metrics, our model performed as follows: sensitivity of
0.60; specificity of 0.75; PPV of 0.25; and NPV of 0.93. Thus, evaluating the predicted
probability values, we observed that our model correctly predicts almost all negative tests with
only 7% of false-negative users among the predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). We focus on
avoiding false negatives (thus maximizing NPV) since we aim to prioritize tests in people with
a potential positive result for COVID-19.
The characteristics of the false-negative and false-positive cases predicted by our
model can be seen in the Supporting Information S3. We observed that most of the falsepositive cases present the top-four predictors with the highest positive coefficients. At the same
time, only four of the false negatives reported the loss of smell - the strongest predictor of a
positive test.

SARS-CoV-2 risk areas in Rio de Janeiro
Aiming to optimize the testing strategy, we applied the predictive model (Equation 1)
to the 287,714 individuals registered in the app and still untested for SARS-CoV-2. According
to our model, 99,431 (34,5%) of these participants were classified as a potential positive
infection. We also visualized the geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
calculating by Equation 2 the proportion of positive test results for each specific geographical

area (named a grid) in the state of Rio de Janeiro. We calculated the predicted infection risk
for each grid (Fig 2) and their risk groups. As of July 16, 2020, we observed that the southern
areas in the city of Rio de Janeiro presented lower proportions of potential positive participants
compared to the northern areas.

Janeiro (capital, left) and the city of Niteroi (right). The grid risk considered the proportion of
potential positive infection (observed test results + estimated from the prediction model) for each grid
(400mx400m area). The risk groups were obtained as very low (<17%), low (‚â•17% and <33%), medium
(‚â•33% and <48%), high (‚â•48 and <63%), and very high (‚â•63%). The map shows the distribution of
risks as of June 10, 2020.

External Validation
The "Dados do Bem" app incorporated our final model (Equation 2), using it to
prioritize users for testing in some Brazilian states. For the external validation of the model,
we analyzed the Goias state, where 465 registered users have been tested in 20 days. Of these,
52% had positive results.

Discussion
Extensive testing programs for SARS-CoV-2 are, in general, not available in low- and
middle-income countries, conferring the under-reporting of confirmed cases into a problem. A
previous study estimated that only 9,2% of the Brazilian cases are being notified [6].
Restricting tests hinders the monitoring of the epidemic progression, resource planning, and
evaluation of the effectiveness of the control measures. Besides, it leads to false conclusions
that the disease is under control.
Since it is not possible to test all individuals, some studies suggest that the combination
of symptoms could be used as a screening tool to identify people with potential SARS-CoV-2
infection who could be selected for testing [2,7]. This can be useful for planning public policies
and for preventing the spread of the pandemic. That said, our study used data on individual
symptoms and demographics obtained from an app-based system, known as "Dados do Bem",
to develop a model that predicts individuals with a higher probability of testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Some works criticize the use of symptom-based screening strategies to quantify an
individual likelihood of having COVID-19, due to the non-specific nature of some symptoms
and the existence of co-infections with other respiratory viruses [8]. However, our results
evidenced that such a strategy contributes to optimizing the overall testing strategy. Out of the
287,714 new users still not tested, our model estimated that the virus could infect 99,431 who,
therefore, should be prioritized for testing. It reduced the need for extensive testing to only
34.5% of the registered untested users. This is undoubtedly beneficial as a public policy,
especially in Brazil, a country with the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases and one of
the lowest test rates¬π.
Our model was incorporated into the app and used to select patients for testing in the
state of Goias. Of the first 465 users selected, 52% were tested positive. This positivity rate is
extremely high compared to the observed positivity rate without a model (11.8%). It indicates
that our model presented an excellent performance, improving the test strategy and selecting
the users most likely to be positive in the actual scenario.
In addition to forecasting the likelihood of each user to acquire the virus, our model
also assesses the geographical distribution of these participants, being a source of information
to build a risk map for the state of Rio de Janeiro, as shown in Fig 2. The "Dados do Bem" app
currently uses this map for categorizing risk areas, thus supporting decision-makers to identify

areas with a higher risk of infection and accordingly refine testing and disease control
strategies.
The risk map analysis developed in this work is exemplified in Fig 3, which presents
the risk map of the south zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro. The chosen area includes both
high-income neighborhoods (such as "Ipanema," "Leblon," and "G√°vea") and slums (such as
"Rocinha"). The selected grid in Ipanema is classified as "low risk," which means that the
proportion of positive tests in this grid was between 17% and 33%. The other selected grid is
in Rocinha, which, although located less than three miles from Ipanema, is classified as a "very
high risk" grid, meaning that the proportion of positive tests living in this grid was higher than
63%. The existence of higher-risk areas in poor communities was also noted in other regions
of the state (Fig 2). Many higher-risk grids were located in the north zone of the city, where
the most deprived communities are located ("Complexo do Alem√£o" and "Complexo do S√£o
Carlos," for example). The presence of social inequalities in Brazil has been pointed out by
previous studies [9‚Äì11], which noted that it could be associated with the spreading of the
disease.

Regarding our results of the reported symptoms, loss of smell (anosmia) was the
strongest indicator of SARS-CoV-2, followed by fever, shortness of breath, myalgia, cough,
nausea, diarrhea, and coryza. The significant influence of loss of smell and cough is in line

with previous studies carried out in high-income countries such as the US and UK [2,12‚Äì14],
and the influence of fever, myalgia, and nausea was pointed as significant in some studies
[13,14], but others noted as not associated [2,12]. Regarding sore throat, diarrhea, and shortness
of breath, previous studies observed that they are not significant predictors for the SARS-CoV2 infection [2,12‚Äì14].
Menni and colleagues[2,7] used real-time tracking of self-reported symptoms similar
to ours to predict potential SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of individuals from the US and
UK. This model was applied to compare the incidence in the UK regions. The authors noted
that, in southern Wales, users reported symptoms that predicted, 5 to 7 days in advance, two
spikes in the number of confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by public health
authorities. The prediction models presented NPV of 0.75 and 0.87 in the UK (15,638
participants) and in the US (2,763 participants), respectively. Compared to them, our best
model obtained a competitive performance (NPV of 0.93).
Sebo and colleagues [14] studied a sample of 1,543 primary care patients tested in two
laboratories in the Lyon area (France) and found that the two symptoms most strongly
associated with a positive test were loss of taste (ageusia) and loss of smell and that the
combination of these symptoms resulted in an even stronger association (i.e., the odds of having
a positive test were six times greater than the odds of having a negative test). A recent literature
review of studies analyzing the presence of loss of taste and smell in SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients concluded that, from a total of 10,818 patients, 8,823 presented ageusia (81.6%) and
8,088 presented anosmia (74.8%) [15]. Our results reinforce the literature conclusions about
the strong influence of loss of smell.
This study presents some limitations. First, the symptoms are self-reported. Hence, the
participant may report apparent manifestations of the disease, which may not be precise as
physiological evaluation by a physician. Second, we were unable to know when a symptom
appeared to indicate the stage of the disease at the testing moment. Third, a non-negligible
number of false negatives may be present, considering the sensitivity of the serological test.
However, identification of potential clusters and optimization of testing resources using a
combination of self-reported symptoms is a viable strategy for many countries. A similar
combination of symptoms can explain the SARS-CoV-2 infections in developed countries,
such as the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as in LMIC such as Brazil.

Conclusions
Our work used data regarding individual symptoms and demographics obtained from
an app-based system to predict individuals with a higher probability of being infected by
SARS-CoV-2. The model was applied in practice to select users from the state of Goias for
testing, resulting in a positivity rate that was 4.4 more accurate than the positivity rate observed
without using the model. In addition, the developed model was applied to new users of Rio de
Janeiro to determine the risk of being infected in different geographical areas of this state. Our
model estimated that 35.6% are potentially infected, reducing the need for extensive testing
and optimizing the overall testing strategy. Based on the risk map derived from the model, the
decision-makers may locate regions with a higher risk of positive tests, therefore allowing
better testing and disease control policies.
