Abstract

26

Background: Several immunochromatographic serological test kits have been developed to detect

27

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies, but their

28

relative performance and potential clinical utility is unclear.

29

Methods: Three commercially available serological test kits were evaluated using 99 serum samples

30

collected from 29 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

31

Results: The IgM antibody-positive rates of the three serological test kits for samples taken at the

32

early stage of the disease (0–6 days after onset) were 19.0%, 23.8%, and 19.0%, respectively. The

33

IgM antibody-positive rates over the entire period were 21.2%, 60.6%, and 15.2%, respectively. The

34

IgG antibody-positive rates for samples taken after 13 days of onset were 100.0%, 97.6%, and 97.6%,

35

respectively.

36

Conclusion: There were large differences among the results of the three test kits. Only few cases

37

showed positive results for IgM in the early stage of disease and the IgM antibody-positive rates

38

over the entire period were low, suggesting that the kits used in this study were unsuitable for

39

diagnosis of COVID-19. The IgG antibody was positive in almost all samples after 13 days of onset,

40

suggesting that it may be useful for determining infections in the recent past.

1. Introduction

46

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading globally. COVID-19 is caused

47

by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which was confirmed

48

around December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China [1, 2]. Currently, real-time reverse

49

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is employed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a

50

nasopharyngeal swab or sputum for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [3]. However, RT-PCR gives

51

false-negative results in cases of a low viral titer and inadequate sample collection. Studies in China

52

using RT-PCR tests reported that only 60%–70% of COVID-19 patients were positive in the early

53

stages of infection [3-6].

54

Detection of specific antibodies to a pathogen in the bloodstream is widely used to

55

diagnose infectious diseases. An antibody test using a blood sample is relatively quick and

56

straightforward, and because the risk of infection during the sample collection process is low, it is

57

considered by some to be useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [7]. Generally, antigen-specific IgM

58

antibodies increase in the early stage of the onset of a viral infection, which is then followed by an

59

increased level of specific IgG antibodies. IgM antibodies are produced as the first antibody to fight

60

the virus and are transiently raised. The subsequent production of IgG antibodies continues to rise

61

for a long time and plays a vital role in immunity against the same virus. Therefore, the detection of

62

specific IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may be used for diagnosis in the acute phase of

63

COVID-19, whereas the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies may be used for

64

determining a past infection or acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

65

Immunochromatographic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kits have been recently

66

developed by multiple manufacturers [8]. However, differences in their properties and clinical

67

usefulness are mostly unknown [9]. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of three different

68

immunochromatographic anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection kits using serum from COVID-19

69

patients.

2. Materials and Methods

72

2.1. Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

73

We evaluated three test kits for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody in

74

serum: 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (Hangzhou AllTest Biotech Co., Ltd., China),

75

COVID-19 IgM/IgG Duo (SD BIOSENSOR, Korea), and 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit

76

(Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., China). All kits were based on colloidal gold-labeled

77

immunochromatography. All tests were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions for

78

each kit, and the results were visually inspected within 15 min.

81

We utilized a series of residual serum samples left over after routine laboratory testing of

82

29 COVID-19 patients (mean age, 52.9 ± 21.9 years; 14 males and 15 females) who were admitted

83

to Fujita Health University Hospital, Toyoake, Japan, from February 28 to April 15, 2020. All

84

patients were confirmed as COVID-19 cases by RT-PCR assay of nasopharyngeal swab specimens

85

at the time of or prior to admission. All serum samples, aliquoted and stored at -80°C, were thawed

86

and evaluated at the same time for the analyses. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee

87

for Clinical Research, Center for Research Promotion and Support, Fujita Health University

3. Results

91

3.1. Positive rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody

92

Table 1 shows the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody in patients’ serum according

93

to the number of days after disease onset. The IgM antibody-positive rate of the three kits in the

94

early stage (0–6 days after onset) was 19.0% (Hangzhou AllTest), 23.8% (SD BIOSENSOR), and

95

19.0% (Vazyme Biotech), showing comparable results among the kits. On the other hand, the IgM

96

antibody-positive rate 7 days after the onset showed considerable differences among the kits. After

97

13 days of onset, the IgM antibody-positive rates were 23.8%, 88.1%, and 14.3% for the Hangzhou

98

AllTest, SD BIOSENSOR, and Vazyme kits, respectively. The SD BIOSENSOR kit showed a

99

particularly high IgM antibody-positive rate (Table 1). The total IgM antibody-positive rates over the

100

entire period were 21.2%, 60.6%, and 15.2% for the Hangzhou AllTest, SD BIOSENSOR, and

101

Vazyme kits, respectively.

102
103

3.2. Positive rate of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody

104

Table 2 shows the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in patients’ serum according

105

to the number of days after onset. The IgG antibody-positive rates in the early stage (0–6 days after

106

onset) were 33.3%, 33.3%, and 28.6% for the Hangzhou AllTest, SD BIOSENSOR, and Vazyme

107

kits, respectively. Patients positive for IgG antibody were observed at the early stage of the onset.

108

The IgG antibody-positive rates after 13 days of the onset were 100%, 97.6%, and 97.6%,

109

respectively, showing that the three kits gave positive results for almost all samples. Note that, since

110

the IgM antibody-positive samples were also IgG antibody-positive, the positive rate of either or

111

both IgM and IgG antibody was the same as the positive rate of the IgG antibody (Table 2).

3.3 Kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody

Figures 1 and 2 show the kinetic results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody of the

115

29 patients in our cohort. Few cases showed positive test results for IgM early in the disease course.

116

Tests for the IgG antibody often turned positive about 10 days after the onset, and most of the

117

samples after 13 days of the onset became positive with all kits. However, there was a dissociation

118

of the results in patient 11, where the AllTest kit gave positive results in all samples, whereas the SD

119

BIOSENSOR and Vazyme kits gave negative results.

120
121
122

4. Discussion

The serological detection of antibodies is widely used for the diagnosis of viral infections.

123

Since immunochromatography methods to detect antibodies are quick to perform, easy to use, and

124

do not require additional equipment, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody using

125

immunochromatography kits may be helpful for diagnosing COVID-19.

126

We compared three immunochromatography kits for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2

127

antibodies using serum samples from COVID-19 patients. There was a considerable difference

128

among the kit results, especially for IgM. It is thus clear that kit selection is crucial and should be

129

based on the clinical purpose for the test. Additionally, since only a few samples were positive for

130

the IgM antibody in the early stage of the disease by all kits, it appears that the kits used in this study

131

are unsuitable for diagnosing the acute phase of COVID-19.

132

A comparison of the IgG antibody results between the three kits did not reveal any large

133

differences. Additionally, almost all serum samples collected after 13 days of onset were positive.

134

This suggests that the IgG antibody test using these kits can be helpful in diagnosing COVID-19

135

after a certain period from disease onset. However, the results of one patient were positive for one

136

kit and negative for the other two kits, suggesting the presence of false-positive and false-negative

137

results. Since research regarding the cause of false-positive and false-negative results in

138

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests has yet to be performed, further investigation is necessary, such as

139

determining the presence of cross-reactions with other coronaviruses. Furthermore, it is unclear how

140

long anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels continue to rise in serum after infection, and further

141

research is warranted.

142

Currently, epidemiological studies in several countries use immunochromatography kits to

143

detect antibodies [10]. We suggest that when using immunochromatography kits for COVID-19

144

diagnosis, particular attention must be paid to whether these kits detect neutralizing antibodies

145

against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 contains at least four structural proteins (spike [S] protein,

146

envelope protein, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid [N] protein) [11, 12]. Since S protein appears

147

to be involved in adhesion between virus and host cells during infection, it is considered that an

148

antibody against S protein acts as a neutralizing antibody [13-15]. The detection of antibodies by

149

immunochromatography kits may be useful for determinig a previous virus infection, but it is

150

unclear whether the results could indicate people who have gained acquired immunity. Besides,

151

quantitative assay of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, such as ELISA, would give a better

152

understanding of humoral immune response to COVID-19 infection over time.
