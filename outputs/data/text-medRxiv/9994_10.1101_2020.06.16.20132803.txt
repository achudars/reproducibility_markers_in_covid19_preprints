Abstract
Background: The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics) was developed to
provide an accurate and reliable method for the detection of antibodies to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity
of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay.

Methods: The performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was assessed at Roche
Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Sensitivity was evaluated using anonymised residual frozen
samples from patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR); one or more consecutive samples were collected from patients at various
timepoints after PCR confirmation. Specificity was evaluated using anonymised unselected residual
frozen samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors; all samples were collected
before December 2019 and thus deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Crossreactivity was evaluated using anonymised frozen samples containing a wide range of potentially
cross-reacting analytes, which were purchased from commercial vendors. For sensitivity and
specificity, point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results: Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 496 samples from 102 patients
with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was 99.5% (95% CI 97.0–100.0) at ≥14 days after PCR
confirmation. Overall specificity in 10,453 samples from routine diagnostic testing (n = 6305) and
blood donors (n = 4148) was 99.80% (95% CI 99.69–99.88). Only 4/752 samples containing potential
cross-reacting analytes were reactive with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, resulting in an
overall specificity in this cohort of 99.5% (95% CI 98.6–99.9).

Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.5% at ≥14
days after PCR confirmation and a very high specificity of 99.80%. Our findings support the use of the
Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay as a tool for the identification of past SARS-CoV-2 infection,
including in populations with a low disease prevalence.

Introduction
In December 2019, reports emerged of patients presenting with pneumonia of unknown aetiology in
Wuhan, China.1,2 This disease was subsequently shown to be caused by a novel coronavirus, severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and designated coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19).3–5 Since then, the COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly developed into a pandemic, which has
infected millions of people and posed critical challenges for governments and healthcare systems
around the world.6
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family. All coronaviruses
share similarities in the organisation and expression of their genome, which encodes 16 nonstructural proteins and four structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid
antigens.5,7–9 Evidence to date suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted between people
through respiratory droplets and contact routes, although indirect transmission via contaminated
surfaces is also possible.10–12 Infected individuals may exhibit a variety of symptoms, including fever,
cough, and breathlessness, and disease severity can range from asymptomatic/mild cases to severe
disease and death.13,14
There is an urgent unmet clinical need to more effectively determine SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in
the general population to improve our understanding of virus circulation dynamics, gain a more
accurate estimate of the mortality rate from COVID-19, and identify individuals at risk of infection.
Serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 have been suggested as a potential tool to help identify the extent
of virus exposure in a given population and thereby indirectly inform on the appropriate application,
enforcement, or relaxation of containment measures.15–18 Serological assays may also help elucidate
a potential correlate for subsequent immunity following infection.15,16
The timing of seroconversion is crucial for determining optimum timepoints for sample collection for
serological testing.19 Although the picture is rapidly developing and robust serology data are not yet
available, antibody kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 have begun to be described. Based on current evidence,

immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies are detectable within 5 days after symptom onset and
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies within 5–7 days.20–22 There is a paucity of data on
immunoglobulin A (IgA), but it appears to be observable approximately 3–6 days after symptom
onset.15,21 Depending on the applied method, seroconversion is observed after a median of 10–13
days after symptom onset for IgM and 12–14 days for IgG; maximum seroconversion occurs at 2–3
weeks for IgM, 3–6 weeks for IgG, and 2 weeks for total antibodies.20,22–26 Levels and chronological
order of IgM and IgG antibody appearance are highly variable, supporting detection of both
antibodies simultaneously.17,22,23,25
The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz,
Switzerland) was developed to provide an accurate and reliable method for the detection of
antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, in order to facilitate population screening with high specificity and the
identification of past infection status as a potential correlate for subsequent immunity. We aimed to
evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoassay.

Materials and Methods
Study design

The performance of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was prospectively evaluated at
Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted using
anonymised residual frozen samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors, which
were obtained from diagnostic laboratories in Germany and a blood product provider in the United
States, respectively. Cross-reactivity analyses were conducted using anonymised frozen samples
containing potentially cross-reacting factors, which were purchased from commercial vendors.

The study was conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, including relevant European
Union directives and regulations, and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All samples,
excluding the specimens that were provided by commercial sample vendors, were transferred to
Roche following anonymisation. For studies with anonymised leftover specimens, no ethics

Assay

The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay is intended for use on cobas e
analysers (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) for the in-vitro qualitative
detection of antibodies (including IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma. The
immunoassay utilises a double-antigen sandwich test principle and a recombinant protein
representing the nucleocapsid antigen for the determination of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
For the present study, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was performed according to
manufacturer instructions and assay results were interpreted as follows: cut-off index <1.0, nonreactive/negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; cut-off index ≥1.0, reactive/positive for anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies.
Sensitivity

Sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was evaluated using residual samples from
patients who had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). One or more consecutive samples were collected from patients at various timepoints after
PCR confirmation. Samples derived from all patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
were used; no additional sample selection was made except for the availability of a sufficient
amount of residual serum or plasma. Assay sensitivity at different timepoints after PCR confirmation

was calculated as the percentage of samples that tested positive with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoassay relative to the total number of PCR-confirmed positive samples.
Specificity

Specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was evaluated using unselected residual
samples from routine diagnostic testing or from blood donors. All samples were collected before
December 2019 (i.e. before the first description of an infection with SARS-CoV-2) and were thus
deemed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Assay specificity was calculated as the
percentage of true SARS-CoV-2 antibody-negative samples that tested negative with the Elecsys
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay.
Cross-reactivity

Cross-reactivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was evaluated using samples that had
previously been characterised as positive for a wide range of different indications, including a
common cold panel and samples from patients with autoimmune conditions and other diseases that
are associated with a higher prevalence of autoantibodies and immune dysfunction, which may
increase the risk of interference with serological testing. Assay specificity was calculated for each
potential cross-reactive sample type and for the total cohort as the percentage of samples tested
that were reactive with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay.
Statistical analyses

Sample size estimation for the specificity analyses was calculated using the binomial exact test.27 The
following sample sizes for a seronegative cohort would be required to obtain alpha = 5% and power
= 80%: p0 = 0.99, n = 368; p0 = 0.995, n = 736; p0 = 0.996, n = 921; p0 = 0.997, n = 1228; p0 = 0.998,
n = 1843; p0 = 0.999, n = 3688; p0 = 0.9995, n = 7376. A sample size of n >10,000 would ensure the
analyses were sufficiently powered to provide a reliable estimate of assay specificity. For the crossreactivity analyses, the aim was to evaluate n ≥10 samples per cross-reacting factor.

Determinations were performed as single measurements. For sensitivity and specificity, point
estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results
Sensitivity

A total of 496 samples from 102 patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were
included in the sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity increased with time after PCR confirmation: 60.2%
(95% CI 52.3–67.8) at 0–6 days; 85.3% (95% CI 78.6–90.6) at 7–13 days; and 99.5% (97.0–100.0) at
≥14 days (Table 1; Figure 1).
Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay results for 26 consecutive samples from five patients
following recovery from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are shown in Figure 2.
Specificity

A total of 10,453 samples were included in the specificity analyses: 6305 samples from routine
diagnostic testing and 4148 samples from blood donors. The overall specificity for the entire sample
cohort was 99.80% (95% CI 99.69–99.88); 99.81% (95% CI 99.67–99.90) in routine diagnostic samples
and 99.78% (95% CI 99.59–99.90) in blood donor samples (Table 2).
Cross-reactivity

Out of 752 samples with potential cross-reactivity, four samples were reactive with the Elecsys AntiSARS-CoV-2 immunoassay: 1/85 (1.2%) acute cytomegalovirus infection samples; 2/105 (1.9%) acute
Epstein-Barr virus infection samples; and 1/10 (10.0%) systemic lupus erythematosus samples (Table

3). The overall specificity in this cohort was 99.5% (95% CI 98.6–99.9; Table 3).

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant mortality and morbidity, and created major
challenges for governments and healthcare systems. Due to the novelty of the causative agent,
SARS-CoV-2, and the rapidity with which it has spread, there is an urgent need for serological assays,
which could be used to determine the seroprevalence in a given population and help identify a
potential correlate for immunity secondary to exposure.15–18 This urgency and the lack of existing
available tests prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to allow manufacturers of serological
assays for SARS-CoV-2 to bypass the normal approval process, resulting in an inundation of tests
being released into the market, many of which have not been sufficiently reviewed by regulatory
authorities nor their performance reported in the peer-reviewed literature.16 However, it is vital that
any new test is adequately evaluated and validated to demonstrate that it is reliable and accurate
for its intended purpose.
To enable population screening to determine the level of exposure and identify individuals who may
be immune following infection, an ideal serological test for SARS-CoV-2 should meet several key
requirements: 1) a high general specificity with a small CI; 2) no cross-reactivity with other endemic
coronaviruses; 3) preference for the detection of mature antibodies to provide the potential for
correlation with neutralising activity; and 4) a high sample throughput to meet the huge demand for
testing. The first three requirements can be achieved through the application of appropriate assay
format and antigen selection, while the last requirement relies on a high-throughput platform and
upscaling of laboratories. Although a high assay sensitivity is desirable, it is of secondary importance
and should not be pursued at the expense of specificity for past infection, as a serological assay is
less likely to be used for the diagnosis of active infection.
The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay was specifically designed to meet these requirements. It
utilises a double-antigen sandwich test principle for the detection of high-affinity (i.e. lateonset/mature) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoassay demonstrated an overall specificity of 99.80% (95% CI 99.69–99.88) in 10,453 residual

samples from routine testing and blood donors. The sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoassay in samples from patients with prior PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection increased
with time after PCR confirmation, reaching 99.5% (95% CI 97.0–100.0) at ≥14 days. The performance
of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay is comparable or better than that observed for other
serological SARS-CoV-2 assays (specificity, 94.8–99.9%; sensitivity at ≥14 days post-PCR
confirmation, 75.0–100.0%).28,29
The main risk with the use of serological SARS-CoV-2 assays for population screening is the
possibility of false-positive results, which could lead to the erroneous assumption of past infection
and subsequent putative immunity, and put the individual at risk of acquiring or transmitting
infection.16 A very high specificity is crucial to reduce the rate of false-positive results, particularly in
populations with low seroprevalence where small differences in assay specificity can result in
substantial differences in the positive predictive value (PPV).15,16 For example, if the seroprevalence
of SARS-CoV-2 in a given population was 10%, a serological test with a sensitivity of 83.1% and a
specificity of 98.3% would have a PPV of 84.2%; however, if the seroprevalence is 1%, the respective
PPV would drop to 32.6%.30 Understanding this relationship between seroprevalence, specificity,
and PPV is crucial for population screening using serological testing, and it has been suggested that
assay specificity should be >99% (with a CI of 99.0–99.9) to ensure a sufficient PPV in populations
with low seroprevalence.16 Based on a sensitivity of 99.5% and a specificity of 99.8%, the PPV of the
Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in populations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% seroprevalence
would be 83.4%, 96.3%, 98.2%, and 99.2%, respectively. A potential cause of false positives is crossreactivity with other analytes. In the present study, only 4/752 samples containing potential crossreacting analytes showed reactivity with the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, resulting in an
overall specificity of 99.5%.
Based on our understanding of other respiratory viruses, it has been suggested that the presence of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will provide some immunity, although it is unclear how long any

protection would last for after initial infection.31 Assuming anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies do offer some
immunity from further infection, donated plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19
may represent a potential therapy by conferring immunity to the recipient.31 In this context,
serological assays could provide another important role in the identification of potential
convalescent plasma donors, particularly individuals with very high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody
titres.16 Recent studies suggest that both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are likely to
play a protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the spike and nucleocapsid antigens in particular
have been shown to be highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed during infection.7–9,32
Antibodies targeting these proteins are formed as early as 9 days after symptom onset and have
demonstrated a strong neutralising response, suggesting that seroconversion may lead to immunity
for a limited time after infection.15,17,33 However, further research is needed to demonstrate the
correlation between the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and neutralisation, and ultimately
the correlation with clinical immunity. Additional work is also required to establish whether there is
a correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and disease severity and/or prognosis.34
A major strength of this study is the large number of seronegative samples (n = 10,453) used to
determine the specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, which ensures the study is
robustly powered and the reliability of the specificity point estimates is very high (as indicated by the
small CIs).16,35 To our knowledge, this is one of the largest sample sizes used to date to evaluate the
specificity of a serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Another study strength is the inclusion of a high
number of confounder samples in the cross-reactivity cohort, which comprised a total of 752
samples across 35 different indications. A limitation is that this was a single-centre study and our
results should be confirmed by additional assessments at other study sites. Further clinical data on
the samples were not available due to data regulations, and thus it was not possible to analyse
specific sub-cohorts according to age, disease severity, onset of symptoms, etc. We are confident
that our results regarding the sensitivity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay and the time
course of antibody response are of general value. However, the findings should be interpreted with

some caution. Although the samples used in this study were not selected on the basis of patient
criteria, the majority of samples were drawn from hospitalised patients and therefore probably
represent more severe cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, the availability of samples depended on the
need of consequent routine clinical chemistry diagnosis after PCR-confirmation of SARS-CoV-2
infection. Again, it can be assumed that extensive subsequent diagnosis was predominantly
performed in cases with more severe disease. The validity of our findings in ambulatory settings or in
patients with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be shown and
requires further study.

Conclusion
The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a very high specificity of 99.80% and a
sensitivity of 99.5% for past infection in patients at ≥14 days after PCR confirmation, supporting its
use as a potential tool for the identification of past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection. High assay
specificity and sensitivity are crucial to ensure a high PPV for population screening, particularly in
settings with low disease prevalence.
