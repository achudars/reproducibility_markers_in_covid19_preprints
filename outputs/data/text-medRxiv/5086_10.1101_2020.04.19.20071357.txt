Abstract

The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2, COVID-19) has an estimated overall case fatality ratio of 1.38% in China, being 53%
higher in males and increasing exponentially with age. Mosaicism for X chromosome
monosomy (XCM) shows a similar increase in aging population mostly driven by loss of
chromosome Y in males (LOY), and is associated with a raise in all-cause mortality. Using
comparative transcriptomic data, we have defined that XCM/LOY is associated with abnormal
peripheral blood cell counts with decreased progenitor cells and multiple biomarkers of immune
system dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and increased cardiovascular risk. Several
differentially down-regulated genes in XCM/LOY individuals are involved in the initial immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 (OR of enrichment=7.23, p=1.5x10-7), mainly interferon-induced
genes that code for inhibitors of viral processes. Thus, our data suggest that XCM mosaicism
underlies at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients.
Given its potential relevance for modulating prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose
that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently established methods should be implemented as
biomarkers in infected patients, including currently ongoing clinical trials with different
medications and vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly
people may also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable
to severe Covid-19 disease.
Introduction

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a major health threat to the entire
world.1 As of April 19, 2020, there have been more than 2.3 million confirmed cases of COVID19 worldwide, with more than 160,000 deaths reported. While good estimates of the case
fatality ratios are widely lacking, it is clear that mortality is highest in old men. A best reported

estimate of the overall case fatality ratio after adjusting for demography and underascertainment in the initial outbreak in China was 1.38% (95% CI 1.23–1.53), being significantly
higher with aging (6.4% in ≥60 and 13.4% in ≥80 age groups) and in males; 2.8% as compared
with 1.7% in females2 . Emergent data of the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection
fatality ratio in other countries show a similar pattern with a remarkable sex-bias increasing with
advancing age. The numbers and proportions may even further increase when patients in aged
care facilities are fully registered. Sex-dependent differences in disease outcomes were also
found during the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics 3,4 and in mice infected with the
virus. 5

Understanding the underlying basis of this different sex and age vulnerability is crucial because
men and women are likely to have fundamentally different reactions to the SARS-CoV-2 virus
infection, possible treatments and vaccines. Proposed causes include different case definition of
disease, different environmental factors (such as life-style, smoking history or workenvironment) and sex-specific immune-defense factors. In particular, the X chromosome
harbors multiple genes important for immunity and there are many X-linked immunodeficiencies,
so males have greater susceptibility to infections starting at birth.6 More specifically, SARS
viruses use the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), encoded by an X-linked gene, as a
receptor to enter and infect ACE-2 expressing cells.1 Thus, sex variation in the expression of
this gene with paradoxically higher expression and higher circulating levels in men than in
women has also been proposed as a candidate mechanism.7 However, ascertainment bias and
environmental factors are unlikely to prevail in different populations while the gender-specific
immune factors or ACE2 variation would not fully explain the increased risk and sex-divergence
with aging.
Developmental (causing Turner syndrome) or late onset X chromosome monosomy in
mosaicism (XCM), usually with loss of the inactive X-chromosome, is detectable in female
leukocytes with a frequency that increases with age (0.05% in 50-year olds; 0.25% in 75-year
olds).8 Individuals with XCM have an increased risk for autoimmune disease, recurrent viral
9

infections and earlier cardiovascular mortality, which has been attributed to X-chromosome
haploinsufficiency for multiple genes, and is associated with excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6), decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β) and a
lower CD4:CD8 ratio.10 In men, mosaic XCM is much more common, acquired by somatic loss
of the Y chromosome (LOY). LOY is an age related phenomenon that has been associated with
a wide spectrum of human diseases including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular
disease, and reduced overall life expectancy in men.11–14 Genetic variation in multiple loci is
involved in the inherited susceptibility to LOY, which can also be driven by smoking and other
environmental exposures.15 LOY is the most common copy number alteration in male
leukocytes, estimated to occur in <2% men under 60 years of age, but exponentially increasing
with aging to 15–40% in 70–85 year-old males and >50% at 93 years of age.15 Extreme down-

regulation of chromosome Y gene expression mainly driven by genes with X-chromosome
homologs that escape X-inactivation seems to be the functional mediator of the reported
association between LOY and disease.16,17

We, therefore, advance the hypothesis that XCM/LOY is an underlying factor for the increased
severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging men. While data is yet unavailable to directly test
this hypothesis, we have gathered convincing and consistent evidence from current sources of
information.
We have correlated XCM due to LOY in aging males with multiple parameters of cardiovascular
dysfunction, and defined the transcriptomic deregulation that underlies disease risks, including
signatures of immune system dysfunction and increased coagulation activity. We have finally
studied how some of the genes deregulated by LOY are involved in the response to SARSCoV-2 infection.

Subjects, genotype and phenotype data
LOY was assessed in a total of 530 adult men belonging to the Estonian Gene Expression
Cohort (EGCUT, www.biobank.ee) that comprises a large cohort of 53,000 samples of the
Estonian Genome Center Biobank, University of Tartu. Detailed phenotypic information from all
the individuals studied, including clinical analysis (blood cell counts and general biochemistry)
and follow-up until June 2020, was available in ICD-10 codes. Patients selected in this study
were genotyped using OmniX array. All individuals had genotyping success rate above 95%. All
studies were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee
on human experimentation, and with proper informed consent from all individuals tested.
Bulk transcriptome data

from peripheral blood RNA. Low quality samples were excluded. All probes with primer
polymorphisms were left out, leaving 34,282 probes. The expression dataset is publicly
available at GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) under the accession number GSE48348.18 In this
dataset, a total of 11 individuals with LOY were identified. In order to consider the effect of aging
on LOY detection and to have the maximum power (i.e 3 controls per case), 32 age-paired
normal samples per case were selected for the transcriptomic analyses.
The effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on gene expression was assessed in independent
biological triplicates of two different cell lines that were mock treated or infected with SARSCoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020). One corresponds to primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) and the
other to transformed lung alveolar cells (A549). These data are available at GEO under the
accession number GSE147507.
Statistical data analyses
Mosaic LOY detection and quantification was performed using MADloy tool which implements
accurate LOY calling of SNP intensity data using the mean log-R ratio (mLRR-Y) and Bdeviation

For each sample, MADloy first estimates the

normalized mLRR-Y given by its ratio with the trimmed-mean of mLRR-Y values in the
autosomes to discard regions with copy number alterations. B-deviation is calculated for the
pseudoautosomal regions 1 and 2 (PAR1, 0-2.5Mb on both Xp and Yp; PAR2, 300kb on distal
Xq and Yq, Mb 155 and 59 respectively), and the XY transposed region (88-92Mb on X, 2.56.5Mb on Y). The method is calibrated to detect mosaicism when the proportion of affected cells
is above 15%.
Gene expression data was quantile-normalized to the median. We analyzed linear regression
residuals of gene expression data on fourty multidimensional scaling components, to correct for
possible unwanted variability. Array quality was assessed using arrayQualityMetrics
Bioconductor package. genefilter Bioconductor package was used to filter for features without
annotation and/or exhibiting little variation and low signal across samples, leaving a total of
15,592 probes from 34,282. Differential expression (DE) between individuals with and without
LOY was then performed using limma Bioconductor package. Significant DE genes were
considered at false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. Significant DE genes at p<0.001 level were
selected for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler Bioconductor package. Over-representation of DE
genes in the gene set obtained from the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines (p<0.001
and log-foldchange > 0.5) was performed using exact Fisher test. Cell-type composition of the
43 individuals with bulk transcriptomic data (11 LOY, 32 normal) was estimated using the 'xcell'
method implemented in the immunodeconv R package.20

Association analysis between LOY status and clinical data, including blood cell counts and
biochemical parameters, was assessed using linear models adjusted by age. All statistical
analyses were performed using the statistical software R version 3.6.3 (http://www.rproject.org).
Results
Higher Covid-19 severity and mortality in males, a sex-bias that increases with aging
Accumulated data on the age-stratified case fatality ratio and infection fatality ratio in a large
sample from two seriously affected countries, Italy and Spain, show a similar pattern with a
remarkable sex-bias increase with advancing age (Figure 1A). Available reports are mostly
based on hospital records and the same tendency has been reported in other countries. The
numbers and proportions are likely to increase when individuals in aged care facilities are fully
registered (Figure S1). COVID-19 lethality in Italy and Spain and LOY prevalence in men, as
reported in the UK biobank,15 appear to increase exponentially with age (Figure 1B). Sex-biased
COVID-19 mortality, while heterogeneous across countries, is consistently higher for men
(Figure 1C).
LOY detection and correlation with cellular and biochemical phenotypes

We analyzed clinical parameters of 530 “apparently healthy” adult men from the Estonian
Genome Center of the University of Tartu cohort (EGCUT) and classified them as having (n=28)
or not having LOY (n=502). Individuals with LOY have significantly age-adjusted decrease in
red cell counts, decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and higher red cell
distribution width, low basophil counts and borderline low lymphocyte proportions. Biochemical
parameters revealed low albumin levels, low triglycerides and elevated homocysteine and urea
levels (Table S1).
Blood transcriptome in individuals with LOY shows immune defects and cardiovascular risk
We also compared blood transcriptome from 11 men with LOY (median age: 69, range: 58-84)
and 32 age-paired men without LOY (median age: 68, range: 60-87) as controls. Multiple genes
differentially expressed between groups were found, including autosomal and gonosomal genes
(Tables S2-S4 and Figs S2-S3), providing insight into the mechanisms of disease susceptibility
caused by LOY with implications for COVID-19. CSF2RA, located on the X-Y chromosome
pseudoautosomal 1 (PAR1) region, is one of the most significantly down-regulated genes (Fig
2A), along with other multiple Y chromosome genes with homologs on the X chromosome that
escape X inactivation and with known function in immunity (Table S4).
Top autosomal genes overexpressed in LOY, such as VWF and MYL9 (Fig 2A), are associated
with cardiovascular risk. VWF codes for the von Willebrand factor (vWF), a pro-coagulant

protein that promotes platelet adhesion and smooth muscle cell proliferation, with MYL9
encodes Myosin Light Chain 9, regulatory, important in inflammatory immune responses.
Since changes in gene expression may reflect differences in cell-type composition and
functionality, we estimated the average cell-type functional composition of samples from
individuals with LOY compared to those without LOY using bulk transcriptome data (Table S5).
The results were consistent with LOY individuals having significantly decreased GM-progenitors
and B cell naïve cells, along with increased counts of endothelial cells (Fig 2B). Enrichment
gene set analysis using DE genes revealed a few categories significantly over-enriched, most
notably the coagulation and cellular detoxification, the leukocyte migration and neutrophil
activation (Fig 2C, Tables S6-S7). Overall, gene expression in LOY individuals leads to a downregulated immune score.
Down-regulated genes in LOY involved in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
We tested whether the genes that participate in the primary response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
were significantly deregulated in blood cells of individuals with LOY. We obtained 249 DE genes
with SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human lung epithelium (NHBE) and 130 for transformed
lung alveolar (A549) (339 unique genes for the two cell lines). This gene set is highly overrepresented in several pathways including defense response to virus, IL-17, type I interferon
and NF-Kappa B signaling (Table S8). From the DE genes in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
13 were also de-regulated in individuals with LOY (Figure 3A and Table S9) indicating a strong
-7

significant over-representation (OR of enrichment = 7.23, p=1.5x10 ). Most of these genes are
interferon response genes (IFIT3, IFI44L, ITFT1, IFI6), which are down regulated in individuals
with LOY (Figure 3B-D).
Discussion

Identification of the status of copy number for chromosomes X and Y in blood cells may have an
immediate clinical relevance in the management of patients with COVID-19. Many of the
biochemical and transcriptomic alterations found in individuals with LOY have been already
associated to poor prognosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection.21-24
There is a number of genes located on the Y chromosome with functional homologs on the X
chromosome that escape X inactivation in females and have relevant functions in the immune
system (Table S4). Cells with XCM are likely haploinsufficient for many of those genes, which
are downregulated in individuals with mosaic XCM due to LOY. In particular, we observed low
expression of CSF2RA in individuals with LOY, who also have low GM progenitors. CSF2RA
codes for the alpha subunit of the heterodimeric receptor for colony stimulating factor 2, a
cytokine which controls the production, differentiation, and function of granulocytes and
macrophages (GM-CSF) that are key for antigen presentation in infections, and is critical for T

cell functions. GM-CSF also increases IL-2R and IL-2 signaling, which can increase expansion
of lymphocytes and IFN-γ production important for anti-viral response. Therefore, GM-CSF
25

leads to enhanced protective responses.

Loss or inactivation of both copies of the CSF2RA

gene is associated with surfactant metabolism dysfunction-4 and pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis, a primary immunodeficiency (OMIM 300700).26 As Leukine® (sargramostim, rhuGM-CSF) is currently being assessed in the SARPAC trial because of its potential positive
effects on antiviral immunity and contribution to restore immune homeostasis in the lungs
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04326920), our data suggest that patients with LOY might
be predictive of a poor response due to their low expression of one of the receptor subunits for
GM-CSF (CSF2RA).

Patients severely affected with COVID-19 have lower lymphocytes counts, specially T cells,
higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio, lower percentages of monocytes,
eosinophils, and basophils, along with generally elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers
and inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Helper, suppressor and regulatory T cells were all
below normal levels in the severe group, with increased naïve helper T cells and decreased
memory helper T cells1,24,27. We observed a significant overlap of deregulated genes in LOY
individuals that participate in the immediate immune response elicited by SARS-CoV-2 virus
infection. Some of these genes clearly activated in both studied cell types infected by SARSCoV-2 are markedly under expressed in individuals with LOY (SLPI, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT3, and
IFI44L) (Figure 3B-D). Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a regulator of innate and
adaptive immunity that protects the host from excessive inflammation in infectious disease,
while the other four genes encode interferon induced proteins of the innate immune system that
28

participate in the immediate host response to viral infections . Dysfunctions of the adaptive
immunity and interferon-mediated immediate host response in individuals with XCM/LOY are
consistent with the observed sexual dimorphism in human immune system aging, and might
underlie a poor immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

29

This patterns along with the

increased severity in older males, suggests that XCM due to LOY may be one underlying factor
for susceptibility to COVID-19 in a proportion of patients.

In addition to depleted hematopoietic progenitor cells and possible immunodeficiency,
individuals with LOY may have increased levels of circulating endothelial cells, which are known
biomarkers for endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease.30 We observed upregulation of VWF and MYL9 in LOY. Pro-coagulant vWF promotes platelet adhesion and
smooth muscle cell proliferation, and elevated levels of vWF have been associated with higher
risk for thrombosis and cardiovascular disease.

31

MYL9 is a ligand for CD69 to form a net-like

structure inside blood vessels in inflamed lungs and is also a risk factor for cardiovascular
disease risk found over-expressed in aged versus young injured arteries.32,33 As such,
XCM/LOY could also contribute to COVID-19 lethality by its associated cardiovascular risk.

In summary, XCM is relatively common in aging individuals with much higher frequency in
males due to somatic LOY. It is associated to decreased progenitors and stem cells, along with
immune system dysfunction and increased coagulation and cardiovascular risk as revealed by
biochemical and gene expression data. Available data to date strongly suggest that this type of
mosaicism may underlie at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in
aging patients, so additional studies are needed to validate and define the extent of our
hypothesis. In order to achieve this goal and given its potential relevance for modulating
prognosis and therapeutic response, we propose that evaluation of LOY and XCM by currently
established methods as potential biomarkers should be implemented in both, retrospective
studies and all prospective and currently ongoing clinical trials with different medications and
vaccines for COVID-19. Testing for LOY/XCM at large scale among elderly people may

also be helpful to identify still unexposed people who may be especially vulnerable to
severe Covid-19 disease.
