Abstract

2

This study reports the sequence analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2

3

(SARS-CoV-2) from infected individuals within the Greater Geelong region, Victoria,

4

Australia. All but one individual had recently returned from travelling abroad, and all had

5

clinical signs consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 belonging to three

6

lineages were detected and represent separate introductions of the virus into the region.

7

Sequence data were consistent with the recent travel history of each case. Full virus genome

8

sequencing can play an important role in supporting local epidemiological tracing and

9

monitoring for community transmission. Quality of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences obtained was

10

highly dependent on appropriate sample collection and handling.

1

Introduction

2

In late December 2019 a novel betacoronavirus, subsequently named severe acute respiratory

3

syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), first appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China 1,2. The

4

virus could be readily transmitted from human to human by respiratory droplets and rapidly

5

spread worldwide 3,4. On 25th January 2020, the Australian Department of Health reported the first

6

confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Melbourne, Australia in a man returning to Australia

7

from Wuhan on the 19th of January 2020 5. On the 7th of March 2020, the city of Greater Geelong,

8

the second largest population centre in the Australian state of Victoria, confirmed its first case of

9

SARS-CoV-2 infection, the 20th in Victoria, in a traveller returning from the USA 6. On the 11th

10

of March 2020, when more than 118,000 cases from 114 countries around the world had been

11

reported, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-CoV-2 infection a global

12

pandemic 7,8. Between the 15th and 16th of March 2020, Australia implemented travel restrictions

13

including banning non-residents from entering the country and for all returning resident travellers

14

to self-isolate for 2 weeks, as well as domestic movement restrictions and social distancing

15

measures including closing of social venues and restriction or limit on the number of people

16

gathering in one location 9,10.

17

The regional health network in the Greater Geelong region commenced SARS-CoV-2 sample

18

collection and testing in the last week of January 2020. In addition to the state reference

19

laboratory, local laboratories mobilised to setup diagnostic PCR capacity. We describe here next

20

generation sequencing (NGS) and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from SARS-CoV-2

21

positive samples collected from 7th March to the 14th of April 2020 to understand the molecular

22

epidemiology of the outbreak in the Greater Geelong region. We briefly describe how sequence

23

analysis can support local epidemiological investigations. We also show how proper sample

24

collection and handling influence overall sequence quality.

Results

2

Virus sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples

3

Ampliseq NGS for SARS-CoV-2 was attempted on the 13 positive samples and the one

4

negative sample as a control (Table 1). All samples were taken through the Ampliseq process,

5

however, two samples (GC-17 and GC-22, Table 1) failed to amplify sufficiently during the

6

Ampliseq panel PCR and were not processed further. These were also the highest Ct samples

7

for which sequencing was attempted with Ct values of 33 and 34 respectively. The remaining

8

11 positive samples (from 7 individuals) and 1 negative sample (GC-28, Table 1) were

9

sequenced and generated a total of approximately 54 million reads with an average of 4.9

10

million reads per sample (1.1 million - 14.3 million). The negative sample was confirmed

11

negative for SARS-CoV-2 reads by NGS. The coverage and quality of the obtained reads of

12

the 11 positive samples varied and correlated somewhat with the virus load as estimated by

13

the RT-PCR, except for one sample (GC-25, Table 1) which despite a high virus load

14

generated short reads and poorer sequence. Overall, we were able to assemble near full length

15

SARS-CoV-2 genome consensus sequences of 6 samples (designated VIC-CBA1 to VIC-

16

CBA6, Table 1) while 5 samples (GC-12, GC-20, GC-21, GC-25 and GC-51, Table 1) only

17

generated partial virus coverage although, except for GC-25, having reads of high quality.

18

The near complete genomes came from samples with a RT-PCR Ct of 31 or lower, while the

19

sequences with partial coverage, except for GC-25, all came from samples with a Ct of 31 or

20

higher.

21

The six near full length sequences, VIC-CBA1 to VIC-CBA6, were deposited in GISAID

22

under accession numbers EPI_ISL_420855, EPI_ISL_420876, EPI_ISL_420877 and

23

EPI_ISL_430064 to EPI_ISL_430066 and were obtained from swabs taken from four

24

individuals. Two individuals had two separate swabs taken 11-15 days apart which generated

25

near complete sequence. Interestingly, for one of these multiple sampled individuals from

26

which two near complete virus genomes were obtained (GC-11 and GC-24, Table 1), another

27

two intervening samples produced only partial sequence (GC-20) or did not amplify in the

28

Ampliseq PCR (GC-22) (Table 1). For the other individual for which multiple samples were

29

sequenced, GC-14 and GC-23 sampled 11 days apart, contributed good sequences while a

30

later sample (GC-51, Table 1) obtained 17 days after the first sample (GC-14), only provided

31

partial sequence (Table 1). In total 6 near full length SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained

32

and used for further analysis.

1

Phylogenetic and Network analysis

2

The 6 near full length consensus sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were compared to related

3

sequences available in GISAID as of April 23, 2020. Fourteen representative closely related

4

sequences, as well as the two earliest SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences from Wuhan, China

5

(WH01_12_26; GISAID accession number EPI_ISL_406798 and WH04_01_05; GISAID

6

accession number EPI_ISL_406801) were included in this analysis (Table S1). A neighbour-

7

joining tree was generated based on nucleotide differences and rooted on the WH01_12_26

8

sequence as the earliest virus sequence available (Figure 1, for details of abbreviated

9

sequence names see Table S1). The same sequences were analysed by maximum parsimony
11,12

10

network analysis

and arranged by date of sampling (Figure 2). The first SARS-CoV2

11

positive sample from Greater Geelong (sampled on 7 th March 2020), designated

12

CBA4_03_07, clustered together with sequences reported from the USA (UW3895_03_27;

13

shown as a representative sequence) and other sequences from Victoria (VIC08_03_15) in

14

both analyses. Interestingly, this individual had returned from travelling in the USA (Table

15

1). This sequence belonged to a lineage more similar to WH04_01_05 than WH01_12_26

16

and has been designated as lineage A.1 in Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner

17

(https://pangolin.cog-uk.io/) (Figure 1 and 2). The other near full length virus sequences

18

belonged to lineages more related to the WH01_12_26 virus, but which have a characteristic

19

aspartic acid to glycine (D-G) amino acid substitution within the spike glycoprotein (S)

20

region caused by a change in one nucleotide at position 23403 (Table 2). The second

21

individual with full length sequence of SARS-CoV-2, designated CBA1_03_23, was closely

22

related to virus sequences obtained around the same time from Victoria (VIC311_03_23),

23

the USA (UW213_03_13) and Europe (Figure 1 and 2). This individual had recently returned

24

to Australia from Europe (Table 1). Sequences CBA3_03_28 and CBA5_04_08, from the

25

third individual but sampled 11 days apart and who also had recently returned from the UK,

26

were closely related to CBA1_03_23 (only 2 nucleotide difference) and to virus sequences

27

from Victoria (VIC52_03_12) (Figure 1-2). These three sequences, CBA1_03_23,

28

CBA3_03_28 and CBA5_04_08 were more closely related to WH01_12_26 and belonged

29

to the lineage B.1, with the characteristic 3-nucleotides substitution (GGG to AAC) at

30

nucleotides 28881-28883 (Figure 1-2 and Table 2) in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N

31

protein) gene. These changes result in a 2 amino acid change from arginine-glycine (RG) to

32

lysine-arginine (KR) (Table 2), and therefore a gain of an additional basic amino acid in this

33

part of the N protein. CBA2_03_24 and CBA6_04_07, from the fourth individual sampled

34

14 days apart, generated identical sequences and were relatively closely related to virus

13

5

1

sequences from England (Engl295_03_25) and Victoria (VIC196_03_19) belonging to

2

lineage B.1.13

3

was tested after developing symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection (Table 1).

4

Interestingly, although sequences CBA3_03_28 and CBA5_04_08 were from samples

5

obtained from the same individual taken 11 days apart, the later sequence, CBA5_04_08,

6

appeared to have an additional change at nucleotide 29066 in the N protein resulting in an

7

amino acid change from a threonine to an alanine (T-A) (see Table 2 and detailed section on

8

amino acid changes below). A third sample (GC-51, Table 1) was obtained from this

9

individual six days after the second sample, and seventeen days after the initial sample was

10

collected, however only partial sequence was obtained. This partial sequence also had the

11

AAC sequence at nucleotides 28881-28883 characteristic for this lineage, although no reads

12

were obtained for the region at nucleotide 29066 where CBA3_03_28 and CBA5_04_08

13

differed (Figure 2). The sequence data from GC-51 also identified a deletion at nucleotide

14

15951 changing the reading frame and immediately running into a stop codon at position

15

15953-15955 (TAG). In addition, this sample, GC-51, also had a nucleotide change at

16

nucleotide position 16000 (C to T), both differences not seen in any other of our sequences.

17

Amino acid polymorphisms in our SARS-CoV-2 sequences

18

Comparison of the obtained six near full length SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed changes at

19

23 nucleotide positions of which 13 changed amino acid when compared with the

20

WH01_12_26 sequence (Table 2). While these sequences overall had 6 nucleotide changes

21

in the ORF1a region, none of these changed the amino acid sequence. In contrast, 4 out of 5

22

nucleotide changes in the ORF1b (nsp12, 13 and 15) region changed amino acids (Table 2).

23

Similarly, 2 out of 3 nucleotide changes resulted in amino acid changes in the surface

24

glycoprotein (S) region including one mentioned above at nucleotide 23403, while each

25

single nucleotide changes in ORF3a, ORF7a and ORF8 regions, resulted in amino acid

26

changes in their respective proteins. The 3 nucleotides at 28881-28883 affects two codons

27

and results in a change in two amino acids while a third change at 29066 also change the

28

corresponding amino acid in the N protein (Table 2).

Discussion

2

In this study we describe the use of NGS to complement the epidemiological and clinical

3

investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infections detected in the Greater Geelong region, Victoria,

4

Australia during the period from the first local case on 7 th March until 14th April 2020.

5

Phylogenetic and network analysis of 6 near full length sequences of SARS-CoV-2 indicated

6

at least three or more separate introductions of the virus into the region. All cases were

7

initially symptomatic and with a history of recent travel or working in health care, prompting

8

their testing. The earliest introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to the Greater Geelong area on 7th

9

March 2020 (CBA4_03_07, Table 1) belonged to a lineage related to WH04_01_05 (GISAID

10

accession number, EPI_ISL_406801), currently believed to be one of the phylogenetically

11

earliest SARS-CoV-2 sequences and designated as lineage A.1 in Pangolin COVID-19

12

Lineage Assigner 13. This lineage was commonly detected in the United States from where

13

this traveller had recently returned. The full length sequence (CBA1_03_23, Table 1) from

14

the second individual and the two full length sequences (CBA3_03_28 and CBA5_04_08,

15

Table 1) from the third individual, belonged to lineage B.1, which was commonly reported

16

from cases in Europe and the United Kingdom

17

nucleotides substitution (GGG to AAC) at nucleotides 28881-28883. These two individuals

18

had recently travelled to Europe or the United Kingdom. The two near full length sequences

19

of SARS-CoV-2 (CBA2_03_24 and CBA6_04_07) from the fourth individual belonged to

20

lineage B.1.13

21

individual had recently travelled.

22

Generally, SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with a Ct value of 31 or lower were found to

23

generate near full length sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with the Ion Torrent Ampliseq method.

24

In samples with a Ct value of 31 or higher, only partial virus genome sequences were

25

obtained. However, sample GC-25 was an exception with a Ct value of 19. Very poor

26

sequence data was obtained from this sample, and it was later determined that the swab from

27

this individual had initially been placed in sterile water as opposed to an isotonic buffer,

28

probably contributing to disruption of any coronavirus virions and degradation of the

29

genomic RNA. In addition, we observed poor virus sequencing in two samples (GC-20

30

(Ct31) and GC-22 (Ct34)) taken 24 hours apart from one individual and in a sample from

31

other individual (GC-21, Ct 31) taken during a local shortage of high quality swabs on 2-3

32

April 2020. A subsequent sample (GC-24, Table 1) taken from the same individual as GC-

33

20 and GC-22, but three days later and with the high quality swab type, resulted in a sample

13

13

. These lineages have a characteristic 3-

which was commonly detected in the United Kingdom from where the

7

1

with a Ct value of 31 and from which a near full length sequence of SARS-CoV-2 genome

2

could be assembled (sample GC-24, sequence CBA6_04_07).

3

Regional virus sequencing and detailed recording of sample collection and subsequent

4

handling has been valuable to help in understanding the local epidemic, inform ongoing

5

SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, and explain the variations in Ct and sequence data obtained from

6

samples. Moreover, the findings are consistent with the epidemiological and case history data

7

indicating that these were likely introductions of the virus to the area from returning

8

travellers. To date, most of the early cases in the state of Victoria have been introductions

9

from returning travellers

14

. Ongoing virus sequencing on local RT-PCR positive samples

10

could complement epidemiological contact tracing and be a sensitive method to detect

11

introduction of new lineages and/or early community transmission.

Materials and Methods

Samples

3

Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from individuals

4

in the region of Greater Geelong, Victoria, Australia between the 28 th of January to the 14th

5

of April 2020. Testing by real time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) occurred at either

6

Barwon Health’s Australian Rickettsial Reference Laboratory (ARRL) or at Australian

7

Clinical Labs (ACL). Remaining sample material left over from the initial diagnostic testing

8

was stored at -80 °C and subsequently transferred to the Geelong Centre for Emerging

9

Infectious Diseases (GCEID) for additional RT-PCR testing and next generation sequencing

10

(NGS). Thirteen positive samples from a total of eight individuals were identified and were

11

included in this study. One positive individual was sampled four times and another positive

12

individual sampled three times to monitor the progression of their infection (Table 1). Out of

13

the 8 positive individuals, 4 were health care workers. All except one had a history of recent

14

travel, and all had clinical symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1). As a

15

negative control, we also included a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative swab (GC-28, Table 1).

16

Samples were collected for this study with approval from the Barwon Health Human

17

Research Ethics Committee (Ref HREC 20/56), and all participants gave their informed

18

consent for their samples and case description to be included. All methods were carried out

19

in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and all experimental protocols were

20

approved by the Barwon Health Ethics Committee.

21

Nucleic acid extraction and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR at GCEID

22

Nucleic acid extraction at GCEID was carried out on all thirteen SARS-CoV-2 positive

23

swabs and one SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (Table 1). Nucleic acid was extracted from 50

24

µl of swab media using the MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit

25

(Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria, Australia) and eluted into 90 µl elution solution using a

26

KingFisher Flex extraction robot (Thermofisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s

27

instructions. The extracted nucleic acids were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using the TaqPath™

28

1-Step Multiplex Master Mix without ROX (Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria, Australia)

29

together with the TaqPath™ COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit (Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria,

30

Australia) using 2.5 µL of extracted nucleic acids added to a final PCR volume of 12.5 µl

31

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR simultaneously

32

detected three virus targets in the ORF1ab, N Gene and S Gene, and one internal extraction

33

control target (MS2 Phage), and was run on a QuantStudio™ Flex 6 real-time thermal cycler
9

1

(Applied Biosystems™) at 25 °C for 2 min, 53 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 2 min and 40 cycles

2

of 95 °C for 3 sec, 60°C for 30 sec

3

cDNA Synthesis, NGS and Data analysis

4

cDNA synthesis for NGS was performed on the nucleic acids extracted from the 13 positive

5

samples and 1 negative sample by first incubating the RNA at 70°C for 5 minutes, and then

6

rapidly cooling on ice. SuperScript™ VILO™ Master Mix (Thermofisher Scientific,

7

Victoria, Australia) was used as per the manufacturers’ instructions and described previously

8

15

9

(Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria, Australia) 11,12 and a commercially available SARS-CoV-

10

2 Ampliseq panel kindly provided by Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria, Australia. This

11

Ampliseq panel contained 237 amplicons covering the near full genome of SARS-CoV-2 and

12

an additional 5 amplicons targeting cellular genes in two primer pools. Amplification was

13

done following the manufacturer’s instructions for either 21, 27 or 35 cycles depending on

14

the estimated virus load in the samples as determined by the multiplex RT-PCR. The Ion

15

Library TaqMan™ Quantification Kit (Thermofisher Scientific, Victoria, Australia) was

16

used for library quantification, and the libraries were run on three Ion Torrent 530 chips in

17

an Ion S5 XL genetic sequencer (Thermofisher Scientific) at a concentration of 50pM as per

18

the manufacturer’s protocols and as described previously 15,16. The sequence reads generated

19

were mapped to a SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NCBI GenBank accession number

20

MN908947)

21

visualized in Integrative Genomic Viewer

22

USA). Near complete and partial SARS-CoV-2 genomes were aligned using Clustal-W 19 in

23

MEGA 7 software 20. Related representative sequences from around the world were selected

24

and downloaded on 23rd April 2020 from the Global Initiative on Sharing All influenza

25

Database (GISAID)

26

analysis. A phylogenetic tree was generated by using the Neighbour Joining method in

27

MEGA 7 software 20. Network analysis of consensus sequences was carried out in Network

28

v5

29

previously

30

. Obtained cDNA was then amplified using the Ion Ampliseq™ Library Kit 2.0

23

1

using the TMAP software included in the Torrent Suite 5.10.1

21,22

18

17

, and

(IGV 2.6.3) (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA,

(https://www.gisaid.org/) and used for comparative phylogenetic

(Fluxus-Engineering, Clare, England) with an epsilon value of 10 as described
11

. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. Phylogenetic analysis of the near full-length sequences of SARS-CoV-2.
The nucleotide sequences were aligned and analysed using the Neighbour Joining method
based on nucleotide differences and rooted on the WH01_12_26 belonging to lineage B in
MEGA 7.0 20 with a bootstrapping of 1000 replicates. The analysis involved 22 SARS-CoV2 sequences (Table S1), including 6 sequences from this study. Branch lengths are scaled
according to the number of nucleotide differences. The sequences from the current study
have been labelled with a black triangle (▲).

Figure 2. Maximum parsimony phylogenetic network analysis of the near full length
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using Network v5 23 with an epsilon value of 10.
The analysis involved 22 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Table S1), including 6 sequences from
this study. Each unique sequence is represented by a coloured circle showing the identity and
frequency in the dataset. Branch length is proportional to the number of nucleotide
differences and the position of changed nucleotide is shown in red. The larger circle labelled
CBA2_03_24 also includes sequence CBA6_04_07 as these two sequences were identical.
Other circles with mixed colour represent two identical sequences.

Table 1. Basic details of 14 samples included in this study. The results of the SARS-COV-2
RT-PCR test (Ct value), the sequence names and GISAID accession numbers are shown.
Samples collected from the same individual at different dates are highlighted with same
colour.
