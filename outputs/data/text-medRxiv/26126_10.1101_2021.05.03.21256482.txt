ABSTRACT

25

Two mRNA vaccines and one adenovirus-based vaccine against SARS CoV-2 are currently

26

being distributed at scale in the United States. Objective evidence of a specific individual’s

27

physiologic response to that vaccine are not routinely tracked but may offer insights into the

28

acute immune response and personal and/or vaccine characteristics associated with that. We

29

explored this possibility using a smartphone app-based research platform developed early in the

30

pandemic that enabled volunteers (38,911 individuals between 25 March 2020 and 4 April 2021)

31

to share their smartwatch and activity tracker data, as well as self-report, when appropriate, any

32

symptoms, COVID-19 test results and vaccination dates and type. Of 4,110 individuals who

33

reported at least one mRNA vaccination dose, 3,312 provided adequate resting heart rate data

34

from the peri-vaccine period for analysis. We found changes in resting heart rate with respect to

35

an individual baseline increased the days after vaccination, peaked on day 2, and returned to

36

normal on day 6, with a much stronger effect after second dose with respect to first dose (average

37

changes 1.6 versus 0.5 beats per minute). The changes were more pronounced for individuals

38

who received the Moderna vaccine (on both doses), those who previously tested positive to

39

COVID-19 (on dose 1), and for individuals aged <40 years, after adjusting for possible

40

confounding factors. Taking advantage of continuous passive data from personal sensors could

41

potentially enable the identification of a digital fingerprint of inflammation, which might prove

42

useful as a surrogate for vaccine-induced immune response.

INTRODUCTION

48

Due to an unprecedented effort in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, three vaccines are

49

currently authorized and distributed in the United States: two two-dose mRNA vaccines,

50

developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, and one single-dose adenovirus-based vaccine,

51

developed by Janssen / Johnson & Johnson.1-3 The population-wide efficacy of these vaccines

52

has been well established both through large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials, and reinforced by real-

53

world data.4-8 Although it is known that there is substantial variability in individuals’ immune

54

response to vaccines,9 and that some fully vaccinated individuals can still become infected,10

55

there is currently no routinely available method to objectively identify a specific person’s

56

response to a vaccine beyond self-reported side-effects, which are common. The Centers for

57

Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) V-safe program found a majority (69%) of the 1.9

58

million enrolled individuals receiving the second dose of a mRNA vaccine reported some

59

systemic side effects.11 Many of the reported symptoms were consistent with systemic

60

inflammation including fatigue, myalgias, chills, fever and joint pain being report in the range of

61

25.6% to 53.9% of individuals the day following their 2nd dose.12

62

In this analysis from the Digital Engagement and Tracking for Early Control and Treatment

63

(DETECT) study,13 we collected daily wearable sensor data from the two-weeks before and after

64

each vaccination dose from 4,110 volunteers who documented receiving at least one dose of the

65

vaccine (2,366 received both doses of a mRNA vaccine). We hypothesized that there are digital

66

biomarkers of vaccine-induced inflammatory responses via subtle deviations from an

67

individual’s normal resting heart rate (RHR), as well as changes in a person’s routine sleep and

68

activity behaviors in the days surrounding a vaccine dose. Through exploring individual and

69

vaccine characteristics that might influence that response we identified a stronger response

associated with prior COVID-19 infection after the first dose only, and to the Moderna, relative

71

to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, after both doses.

73

METHODS

74

DETECT is an app-based longitudinal prospective study which has enrolled 38,911 individuals

75

so far from the United States (from March 25, 2020 to April 4, 2021) who have donated their

76

wearable data, self-reported symptoms when ill, viral testing results and vaccination dates/type.

77

The protocol for DETECT was reviewed and approved by the Scripps Office for the Protection

78

of Research Subjects (IRB 20–7531). All participants in the study provided informed consent

79

electronically.

80

Among DETECT participants, 4,110 have reported receiving at least one dose of the vaccine

81

(3,954 first dose only, 2,366 both first and second dose, 156 single dose), 57% were female and

82

their median age was 56 (inter quartile range, IQR 44 - 66).

83

Individuals who had been vaccinated with the single dose Janssen vaccine were excluded as

84

there were too few (156 individuals) to allow for a meaningful comparison. We have included in

85

the analysis individuals wearing a Fitbit device (76%) and an Apple watch (20%), while 151

86

individuals with other devices were not included in this analysis. We also excluded 31

87

participants who reported a vaccine date before Dec. 11, 2020 – the official date of the first US

88

vaccine intake – and 6 participants who did not report age or gender. Individuals were excluded

89

if they had less than 4 days of recording in the 2 weeks before dose 1 vaccination, or less than 3

90

of the 5 days after vaccination, or less than 14 days during the baseline period (from 60 days to 7

91

days before vaccination). A number of individuals were excluded in the calculation of RHR

92

(454), sleep (1091) and activity (345) metrics because of missing data.

93

For each individual, we calculated the average of the absolute changes of RHR, sleep and

94

activity with respect to their individual baseline, which we have previously shown to be

95

relatively stable for an individual over time, but to vary substantially between individuals.14,15 A

96

single daily value is considered valid only if the device was worn for more than 15 hours during

97

the day. The RHR was based on the value of heart rate that would be obtained in a supine

98

position immediately after waking but before getting out of bed for Fitbit devices,14 and by

99

considering heart rate values over the day by a proprietary algorithm for Apple watches. The

100

individual baseline was calculated using the period from 60 days to 7 days before vaccination,

101

using a decreasing exponential (with exponent α=0.05) to reduce the weight of days farthest in

102

the past. The baseline for the RHR was calculated as

while the RHR metric was

RHRmetric(𝑑) = 𝑅𝐻𝑅(𝑑) − 𝑅𝐻𝑅𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒

106

The sleep and activity metrics were calculated accordingly using the total time asleep and the

107

number of steps recorded by the sensor in the 24 hours, respectively. In the figures, the mean

108

(over all individuals) and the 95% confidence interval for each metric (RHR, sleep and activity)

109

in the 15 days before and after the first and second dose of the vaccine are represented. The

110

cumulative distribution of the maximal variation in RHR in the 2 days after the vaccines is also

111

represented.

112

The cohort of vaccinated individuals (with first and second vaccine doses, treated separately)

113

was then split into subgroups according to gender, age (<40, 40-60, >60), vaccine type received,

114

and if they previously reported a COVID-19 positive test. For each subgroup and for each

115

metric, the mean (over all individuals) of the individual average value (calculated considering the

116

day of vaccination and the following 4 days), with the corresponding confidence interval was

117

calculated. The 95% confidence interval in the calculation of the mean is obtained with a

118

bootstrap method with 1000 iterations.

119

The demographic characteristics of these groups are reported in the Supplement (Table S.1).

120

Unless stated otherwise, all the reported p-values refer to a two-sided t-test to quantify statistical

changes in the frequency of observation in each group (Table S.1).

123

A multiple linear regression model was used to calculate the estimated marginal means after

124

adjusting for potential confounding variables. A t-test was used to assess significant coefficients

125

and the associated p-values (Table S.2).

RESULTS

128

At least one vaccination to date was reported by 4,110 participants in the DETECT study. After

129

applying the exclusion criteria discussed in Methods, we included a total of 3,312 (80%)

130

individuals for the analysis of changes in their RHR. Of them, 165 (5.0%) reported having been

131

previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection, 1,465 (44%) received the Moderna vaccine and

132

1,847 (56%) received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 3,421 (83%) and 2,675 (65%) participants

133

contributed adequate data - as discussed in Methods - to evaluate changes in activity and sleep,

134

respectively. (Table S.1)

135

We observed that the average RHR significantly increased the day following vaccination,

136

reaching a peak on day 2 with a population mean increase of +0.49 (CI: [0.38, 0.61], one-sided t6

137

test, p = 0.012) and +1.59 (CI: [1.40, 1.74], p < 0.01) beats per minute (BPM) with respect to

138

baseline, following the first and second dose, respectively. We found that the average RHR did

139

not return to baseline until day 4 after the first dose and day 6 after the second (Figure 1a & b)

140

The majority of vaccinated individuals, 70% and 76% after first and second dose, respectively,

141

experienced an increase in their RHR in the two days following the vaccine. (Figure 1c & d)

142

We explored several participant and vaccine characteristics that could impact immune response.

143

(Table 1) We found that average RHR changes with respect to baseline in the 5 days following

144

vaccination did not vary by gender (two-sided t-test, p = 0.44 and p = 0.28 for first and second

145

doses, respectively). In contrast, we found that RHR responses vary by age, with individuals age

146

< 40 years having the greatest increase in RHR. (Figure 2) We showed that < 60 years was

147

associated with a significantly higher RHR increase than 60+ years, but only after the second

148

dose of the vaccine (average 0.78 versus 0.53 BPM, p = 0.03).

149

We found that prior COVID-19 infection was associated with a significantly higher RHR

150

increase after the first vaccine dose relative to those without prior infection (average 0.75 versus

151

0.22 BPM, p = 0.02), but no significant difference after the second dose (0.28 versus 0.68, p =

152

0.10). (Figure 3a & 3b)(Table 1) The changes in RHR for individuals who received the Moderna

153

vaccine were significantly greater than those who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, after

154

both the first (0.39 versus 0.22, p = 0.04) and second doses (0.88 versus 0.46, p < 0.01). (Figure

155

3c & 3d)(Table 1)

156

A multiple regression model was used to adjust for potential confounding factors. Prior COVID-

157

19 infection was independently associated with a higher RHR increase after the first dose, with

158

estimated marginal mean of 0.770 (CI: [0.392, 1.147]) versus 0.293 (CI: [0.195, 0.392]) BPM,

159

p=0.014; and no significant difference after the second dose, 0.275 (CI: [-0.183, 0.734]) versus

160

0.731 (CI: [0.606, 0.856]), p=0.055, after adjusting for age, gender, device, and vaccine type.

161

Similarly, the Moderna vaccine was also independently associated with a higher RHR increase

162

after both doses (with respect to Pfizer-BioNTech), with estimated marginal mean of 0.622 (CI:

163

[0.400, 0.843]) versus 0.442 (CI: [0.231, 0.652]), p=0.035 for first dose, and 0.721 (CI: [0.453,

164

0.989]) versus 0.285 (CI: [0.023, 0.548]), p<0.01 for second dose, after adjusting for age, gender,

165

device, and prior COVID-19 infection. Age was also associated with RHR response, but only

166

after the second vaccine dose (p<0.01). We assessed the interaction between age and gender but

167

did not find it to be significant (p=0.53 and p=0.52 for first and second dose, respectively).

168

(Table S.2)

169

We also observed that normal activity and sleep patterns among participants were minimally

170

affected by the first dose of the vaccine, with no decrease in number of steps and a mean increase

171

of only 13 minutes (CI: [10, 16]) of sleep in the day following the vaccine. However, a

172

significant decrease in activity (-1375 steps, CI: [-1540, -1205]) and increase in sleep (40

173

minutes, CI: [34, 45]) relative to baseline were observed on day 1 after the second vaccine dose,

174

both of which returned to baseline by day 2. (Figures 4 and 5)

175
176

DISCUSSION

177

While there is a goal of achieving COVID-19 immunization in billions of people, there is

178

currently no objective means of detecting a response to vaccines except for the occurrence of

179

side-effects. Moreover, while vaccines against COVID-19 are remarkably effective, they are not

180

100% effective, as recently highlighted by reports of “vaccine breakthrough” in fully vaccinated

181

people. Many individuals are concerned about their lack of any symptoms after getting

182

vaccinated. The present study demonstrates the ability, through widely available wearable

183

sensors, to recognize individual physiologic changes associated with a systemic vaccine-induced

184

inflammatory response.

185

Individual response to vaccination is remarkably complex, incorporating components of innate,

186

humoral and cell-based immune system. A study of response to yellow fever vaccination found

187

significant modulation of expression in 97 genes in the days following vaccination.16 Modern

188

improvements in a range of analytic tools have enabled a system biological approach to better

189

understand the immune responses to vaccination, which have shown promise in helping define

190

molecular signatures that may predict vaccine-induced immunity.17 There are no commercially

191

available tests for neutralizing antibodies to the spike protein or its components S1, S2, RBD,

192

that would provide quantitative evidence of an immune response. Beyond humoral immunity, the

193

early T-cell spike-specific response has recently been shown to be important,18 yet is only rarely

194

assessed in academic research settings. Accordingly, it is currently impossible to identify, at

195

scale, the level of protection an individual acquires after vaccination.19

196

Currently available mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and adenovirus vaccine

197

(Janssen) elicit an inflammatory response through immune cell activation leading to the

198

production of Type 1 interferon and the release of multiple inflammatory mediators.20

199

Vaccination has been shown to stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies, activate

200

virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and lead to the robust release of immune-modulatory

201

cytokines in the days that follow a first, and especially a second dose of the mRNA vaccines.21

202

Beyond rapid stimulation of innate immunity via adjuvant stimulation, prior studies of mRNA

203

vaccines have shown peak production of the vaccine-induced antigen protein to occur as soon as

204

6 hours after vaccination, suggesting that an inflammatory response begins within hours of

205

vaccination.22 Consistent with that, we identified a rapid rise in heart rate the day after

206

vaccination, and one that was more robust after the second dose, unless the participant had prior

207

COVID-19 infection, mirroring the significantly higher incidence of systemic symptoms

208

following the second dose found in V-safe.23 We also observed a more pronounced increase after

209

a Moderna vaccine, in accordance to a recent analysis of V-safe data that identified a higher

210

incidence of side effects relative to those receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, especially after

211

the second dose.12 This may be related to a possible unnecessary excess dose and consequent

212

side-effects, supporting the finding of a randomized trial of full (100 ml) versus half (50 ml) dose

213

of the Moderna vaccine with lack of differences in immune response.24

214

Immunosenescence or waning response to vaccination as someone ages has been described for

215

many vaccines and is a concern for COVID-19.25 We found that individuals in the younger age

216

group (<40 years) had a significantly higher RHR response to the second dose compared to older

217

individuals. Overall, women also reported more side effects to V-Safe compared to men.23

218

Immune response to other vaccines has varied by gender, possibly because of differences in

219

hormones, genetics, or differences in dosing by weight. A prior flu vaccine study found that

220

vaccine induced immunity in mice was increased by estradiol in females and decreased by

221

testosterone in males26 and that as age increased, sex differences in vaccine efficacy was

222

declined. Although the RHR differences we saw was not significant, it is possible that a greater

223

change would be identified when younger age groups are vaccinated.

224

We found that the observable variables (age, gender, previously COVID-19 infection, device

225

used, vaccine type) can explain only 2% of the variance in terms of average changes in RHR

226

(and less than 24% of the variance in terms of peak changes in RHR). It is possible that with

227

further investigation it may be found that RHR response to vaccines may correlate with

228

individual immune response and therefore wearables may offer a way to easily quantify

229

someone’s protection.

230

The presence of a fever has previously been shown to be associated with an increase in heart

231

rate, with an ~8.5 BPM increase for every degree Celsius increase in body temperature.27 While

232

~30% of V-safe participants reported having a fever after their second dose and ~9% after the

233

first, we showed that the vast majority of participants experienced an increase in RHR after both

234

vaccination doses, suggesting that inflammation unassociated with an elevated temperature also

235

influences heart rate, albeit much more subtly.12 Inflammation, outside of that associated with

236

fever, and its influence on heart rate has been previously described, but primarily at a population

237

level.28,29 Similarly, inflammation has also been shown to lead to increase in sleep and a

238

decrease in activity, with a more rapid return to normal with treatment.30,31 By taking advantage

239

of wearable sensors we were able to recognize subtle, but significant deviations from an

240

individual’s unique, normal resting heart rate due to vaccination. We were able to also

241

demonstrate substantial interindividual variability in that heart rate increase that was only related

242

to the mRNA vaccine type and prior COVID-19 infection in our population. The significantly

243

greater heart rate response at the time of vaccination, especially the first dose, in those with prior

244

infection is consistent with a greater immune response for these individuals.32 Although this

245

response is clearly multifactorial, future work coupling continuous sensory data with a “systems

246

vaccinology” approach17 could enable the identification of easily scalable, sensor-based markers

247

of the desired immune response.

248

Limitations

249

The data collected as part of the DETECT study depends entirely on the participants’ willingness

250

to use their wearable device and accurately reporting vaccination date and type. While we do not
11

251

have direct control on self-reported information, the DETECT app provides an intuitive tool to

252

self-report vaccination information, and an optional reminder to report information on the second

253

dose after first one has been reported. While the information collected may not be as accurate as

254

in a controlled laboratory setting, we rely on previous work confirming that self-reported

255

symptoms and sensor data provide valuable information.33-35 Only daily sensor data is considered

256

in this analysis, excluding intra-day data provided by some wearable sensor. These once-a-day

257

values are indeed more stable and less affected by independent confounders like the specific

258

activity performed by the individual during the day. Furthermore, the population in the DETECT

259

study that has received a COVID-19 vaccine may not be representative of the population of the

260

United States, as the study is open to individuals who have access to a wearable device

261

technology.36 While research has found no racial or ethnic variation in smartwatch or activity

262

tracker usage in the U.S., they are less commonly utilized by older individuals, those in the

263

lowest socioeconomic tertile, and lower educational attainment.37 Another reason our results may

264

not be representative of the broader population is that the first phase of the vaccine distribution

265

has focused on an older age range and at-risk individuals based on their profession or health

266

status. It is also possible that some participants had prior COVID-19 that went undiagnosed,

267

which may have impacted their immune response to the first dose.

268

Conclusions

269

Fitness bands and smartwatches are owned by approximately 1 in 3 American adults and appear

270

to provide, through passive data capture, meaningful data to track the physiologic response to
