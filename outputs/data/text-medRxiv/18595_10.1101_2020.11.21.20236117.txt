Antibody persistency and trend post-SARS-CoV-2 infection at eight months

Abstract:
An improved understanding of the immunity offered by the antibodies developed
against SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the development of diagnostic tests and
vaccines. Our study aimed at the longitudinal analysis of antibody presence,
persistence and its trend over a period of eight months in a group of COVID-19
recovered patients who tested positive by real-time quantitative PCR for SARSCoV-2 in the period between the 18th and 30th of March, 2020. The subjects were
divided into two groups based on disease severity: mild and moderately-severe.
The MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV lgM/lgG chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA)
assay was used to analyse the antibody titres. Robust IgG antibody persistency
was demonstrated in 76.7 % of the subjects (23 out of 30) at eight months postinfection. The results of this study highlight an important point in terms of the
association between humoral immune response and disease severity. Patients who
might have experienced a relatively moderate-severe infection may develop a
robust immunity that could persist for a longer duration.

Introduction: Immunity offered by the antibodies developed in recovered COVID-19 patients is a
matter of ongoing debate and encompasses genuine concern for the future. Recent studies and the
media have focused their attention on the role of vaccines offering immunity and persistence of
humoral response ranging from four months [1] to more than six months [2] post-infection.
Methods: A monocentric pilot longitudinal observational study was conducted on 114 subjects
based in the Umbria region in Italy, who had tested positive by real-time quantitative PCR for SARSCoV-2 in the period between 18 -30 March 2020. The demographic characteristics, blood groups,
associated co-morbidities, clinical features, treatment undertaken and dates pertaining to symptom
onset and swab collections were recorded. Sequential serum samples were collected over a period
of eight months for 30 out of 114 subjects who attended all follow-up visits. The aim of this study
was to investigate for presence, persistence and trend of IgM and IgG developed against SARS-CoV2 over time. The subjects were divided into two groups based on disease severity: mild and
moderately-severe. [3] The MAGLUMI® 2019-nCoV lgM/lgG chemiluminescent analytical system
(CLIA) assay was used to analyse the antibody titres. Results were reported as measured
chemiluminescence values divided by the cut off (absorbance/cut-off, S/CO): S/CO>1 was defined as
positive and S/CO≤1 as negative. [4] We treated time as a factor and defined five different time
points: first blood sample was collected in the month of May (T0) and then, one month (T1), three
months (T2), five months (T3),six months (T4) after T0.
Results: The descriptive statistics for the main characteristics of the study group was expressed as
Median, [1st-3rd] quartile for continuous variables and as absolute frequency (column percentage)
for the categorical variables. [Table 1A] Chi squared test was used to measure the association
between disease severity and the categorical variables while the Mann U Whitney test was used to
assess the differences between the disease severity for the continuous variables. Also, in order to
analyse if the differences between disease severity at each time point were significant, the Mann U
Whitney test was used. The Friedman test was applied to look for statistically significant differences

over time between the two severity groups for IgM and IgG. [Table 1B] The normal distribution of
the data was tested by Shapiro Wilks. Robust IgG antibody persistency was demonstrated in 76.7%
of the subjects (23 out of 30) at eight months post infection. [FIGURE 1A]. The positivity cut-off for
CLIA was set at 1.01 and the median titre trends were plotted for IgM and IgG, for both severity
groups. [FIGURE 1B] For the mild group, the IgM titre trend stayed below the set cut off throughout
time, but changed in a statistically significant way. The IgG titre trend dipped at T2 only to return to
an almost linear trend at T3 but did not change in a statistically significant way. Similar findings
were observed in previous studies. [5] For the moderately-severe group, the titre trend for both
IgM and IgG changed in a statistically significant way throughout time with IgM below and IgG
above the set cut-off. The IgG titre trend in this group dipped at T1 and peaked at T2.
This dip experienced for both mild and moderately severe groups for IgG might be due to
contraction of the immune response and may not indicate waning of immunity. [6]
Discussion: This study highlights an important point in terms of association between humoral
immune response and disease severity. Patients who might have experienced a relatively severe
infection may develop a robust immunity that could persist for a longer duration.
