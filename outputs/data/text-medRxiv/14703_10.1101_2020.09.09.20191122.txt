Abstract
There is a plethora of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological
tests based either on nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), S1-subunit of spike glycoprotein (S1) or
receptor binding domain (RBD). Although these single-antigen based tests demonstrate high
clinical performance, there is growing evidence regarding their limitations in epidemiological
serosurveys. To address this, we developed a Luminex-based multiplex immunoassay that detects
total antibodies (IgG/IgM/IgA) against the N, S1 and RBD antigens and used it to compare
antibody responses in 1,225 blood donors across Greece. Seroprevalence based on single-antigen
readouts was strongly influenced by both the antigen type and cut-off value and ranged widely
[0.8% (95% CI, 0.4-1.5%)-7.5% (95% CI, 6.0-8.9%)]. A multi-antigen approach requiring partial
agreement between RBD and N or S1 readouts (RBD&N|S1 rule) was less affected by cut-off
selection, resulting in robust seroprevalence estimation [0.6% (95% CI, 0.3-1.1%)-1.2% (95% CI,
0.7-2.0%)] and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals.

Introduction
There is an urgent need for reliable and highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 serological tests for the diagnosis of
recent or prior infection and estimation of population-wide seroprevalence (1, 2). More than 300 new
SARS-CoV-2 serological tests are currently in development (updated at https://www.finddx.org/covid19/pipeline). Assessing antibody presence with a single-readout assay is performed by selecting a cut-off
value, above which the antibody is considered present (typically, three standard deviations (SD) above the
negative mean distribution) (3). The majority of developed assays report high sensitivity and specificity in
clinical samples obtained either from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients or before the COVID-19
era (4). However, there is growing evidence that assays with seemingly good clinical performance might
not lead to reliable diagnostic outcomes in low seroprevalence epidemiological studies, where
asymptomatic carriers with low antibody titers are overrepresented (2, 5). One approach that holds promise
in addressing this issue, is the development of multi-antigen assays coupled with consensus-based rules.
Recently, a small number of multi-antigen SARS-CoV-2 serological assays that employ “AND” and “OR”
logic rules between different antigen readouts have been developed, showing improved performance in
clinical samples (6-9). More specifically, due to their consensus-based approach, multi-antigen assays
report increased specificity, without the cost of reduced sensitivity, compared to their single-antigen
counterparts. Furthermore, because of the multiple antigen readouts, they can increase the certainty of
diagnosis in borderline cases, i.e. low-titer positive samples (10). To the best of our knowledge, how this
enhanced clinical performance and robustness of multi-antigen approaches translates to low seroprevalence
epidemiological studies has yet to be experimentally investigated.
In this study, we developed a bead-based multiplex serological assay for the simultaneous detection of
antibody response against the N, S1 and RBD SARS-CoV-2 antigens and applied it to a low seroprevalence
epidemiological study. The multi-antigen approach requiring partial agreement between single-antigens
(RBD&N|S1 rule) was first evaluated in well-defined clinical samples and validated against commercially
available single-antigen assays, showing improved performance. In order to experimentally elucidate how
this increase in performance transfers to an epidemiological setting, we compared antibody responses
against the N, S1 and RBD antigens in 1255 blood donors across Greece (26% female; median age, 42
years; range, 17-65). We report striking differences in seroconversion calls between the different antigens
that resulted in a wide range of estimated seroprevalence rates and conflicting diagnoses of positive
individuals. On the other hand, the multi-antigen RBD&N|S1 approach resulted in a more robust estimate
of seroprevalence and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals.

Results
Clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay
The clinical performance of the developed multiplex assay was evaluated in 155 serum samples from 77
PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 78 pre-epidemic individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of the
assay were calculated for the three single antigen readouts and for 11 multi-antigen consensus-based rules
for detection of total, IgG, IgA and IgM isotypes. Performance was evaluated using a cut-off value of mean
plus three standard deviation (SD) for each antigen and the results are presented in Table 1. When assessed
individually, antigens were equally specific producing one or two false positives out of the 78 negative

samples tested [specificity 97.4% (95% CI, 91.1-99.3%) to 98.7% (95% CI, 92.7-99.8%)]. Rules-based
approaches, requiring at least two of the antigens to be above the cut-off (i.e. rules using an AND gate
between two antigens) for reporting a positive result, improved assay specificity in all isotypes vs.
individual antigens (Table 1). On the other hand, rules, requiring at least one/any of the antigens to be above
the cut-off (i.e. OR-based rules), did not improve assay performance when compared to the best performing
individual antigen for the respective antibody isotype. Overall, rules that utilized all three antigens and set
a positive result when at least two of them were above the cut-off (Antigen A AND [B OR C] reported as
A&B|C) showed improved and consistent performance and were further investigated. Similar results were
obtained when different cut-off values, based on ROC analysis, were used (see Supplementary Table S6
and Supplementary Figure S4). A detailed analysis of antibody response for the clinical samples is
presented in Supplementary Material S1.3.
To assess the robustness of the multi-antigen rules their performance was evaluated for a wide range of cutoff values. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for gradually increasing threshold (cut-off)
values, based on the negative sample distribution of each antigen and antibody isotype and are presented in
Figure 1. Rules using all antigens and requiring two or all three to be higher than the threshold were included
in the analysis. Across all isotypes, rules exhibited a more robust profile and were less affected by changes
in the cut-off thresholds compared to individual antigens. Rules provided a clear benefit in assay specificity
with specificities of 100% (95% CI, 95.3-100%) achieved at much lower cut-offs compared to individual
antigens. Additionally, for total and IgG antibody detection, assay sensitivity was retained at high levels
across a wide range of cut-offs resulting in an overall more robust and accurate assay. The RBD&N|S1 rule
was shown to outperform all other rules in terms of robustness and performance (Figure 1).

Assay validation against commercial antibody tests
The performance of our assay was validated using commercially available antibody tests developed by
Abbott and Euroimmun AG against the N and S1 antigens, respectively (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2A,
both N and S1 antigen readouts of the multiplex assay were highly correlated with their commercial
counterparts (Pearson’s r=0.98 for N and 0.9 for S1). Their diagnostic agreement (positive/negative call)
was 100% when compared to Euroimmun S1 assay and Abbott N assay. A strong agreement was also
observed between the commercial assays and the RBD&N|S1 multi-antigen rule (Figure 2B). Specifically,
the RBD&N|S1 rule agreed in 59 out of the 60 samples tested with the Euroimmun S1 assay and in 29 out
of the 31 samples tested with the Abbott N assay. Finally, the three samples in which the assays disagreed,
were called negative by the commercial assays but showed positive readouts in the other two antigens
measured in our multiplex assay and were thus called positive by the multi-antigen rule.

Seroprevalence survey
An important application of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays is the identification of seroconverted
individuals at the population level. Given that asymptomatic infection may induce low SARS-CoV-2
related antibodies titers which may also decline over time, a major requirement for this type of analysis is
a highly sensitive and specific assay. Therefore, we used the total (IgG/IgA/IgM) SARS-CoV-2 antibody
multiplex assay to assess how its high clinical performance translates to estimating seroprevalence in 1,225
asymptomatic blood donors with no known history for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Seroprevalence was
calculated based on the single antigen readouts and the multi-antigen RBD&N|S1 rule and was found to be
strongly influenced both by the antigen analyzed and the cut-off value used to determine the diagnostic
outcome (Figure 3A). As it can be seen in figure 3A, seroprevalence rates from single antigen readouts
ranged between 0.8% (N, mean plus 5 SD cut-off, 95% CI 0.4-1.5%) and 7.5% (S1, mean plus 3 SD cutoff, 95% CI 6.0-8.9%), indicating a wide range of potentially indeterminate cases. When using the

RBD&N|S1 rule, seroprevalence ranged between 0.6% (mean plus 5 SD cut-off for each antigen, 95% CI
0.3-1.1%) and 1.2% (mean plus 3 SD cut-off, 95% CI 0.7-2.0%), in line with the robust performance of the
multi-antigen assay in clinical samples. Furthermore, we examined the overlap of positive individuals being
diagnosed by the single antigens or the RBD&N|S1 rule using the stringent cut-off of mean plus 5 SD
(Figure 3B). We observed a strikingly low agreement between antigens, in that different antigens resulted
in vastly different subsets of positive individuals. Specifically, N shared 2 positive samples with RBD (5.9%
agreement) and 1 with S1 (1.8% agreement), while S1 and RBD shared 6 positive samples (9.1%
agreement). The RBD&N|S1 rule had a total of 7 positive calls, 5 of which were samples with S1 and RBD
positive readouts, 1 with RBD and N positive readouts and 1 with all three antigens above the cut-off.
Finally, we re-analyzed all 1,225 samples with an independent commercially available test which detects
IgG N-specific antibodies (Abbott). From the 6 samples that were called positive (estimated seroprevalence
0.5%) only 2 also scored positive with the multiplex RBD&N|S1 rule. An analysis of the seroprevalence,
agreement rates and overlap of positive samples between the other rules of the multiplex assay (N&RBD|S1,
S1&RBD|N) and Abbott’s test results (N-specific IgG) are shown in Supplementary Figures S5, S6 and S7.

Discussion
During the COVID-19 pandemic, serological tests play an instrumental role in quantifying seroconversion,
seroprevalence, vaccination status and diagnosing recent or prior SARS-COV2 infection. More than 300
assays have been developed using either the N, S1 or RBD antigens and many of them have already reached
the market in unforeseen development speeds (4). However, it is questionable whether single-antigen
assays, with strong clinical performance characteristics, show sufficient diagnostic performance in
population screening studies (5). Here, we developed single and multi-antigen assays, evaluated their
performance in clinical samples and investigated how the increased performance of multi-antigen assays
translates to seroprevalence estimation in a population study.
The developed multiplex platform enabled the simultaneous detection of diverse antibody responses against
N, S1 and RBD, within a single diagnostic run. In line with other clinical performance reports, we found a
high variability of IgM and IgA responses to different antigens in 77 previously infected SARS-CoV-2
individuals (Supplementary Figure S3) (11). In contrast, nearly all positive individuals produced IgG
specific antibodies against all three antigens. Other studies have also evaluated N, S1, and RBD antigens
in single or multiplex formats and reported similar performance characteristics in samples tested two to
three weeks post infection (6, 12-14). The validation of our single-antigen assays against commercial
single-antigen tests (Abbott-N and Euroimmun-S1) showed 100% agreement with our N and S1 readouts
(Figure 2). However, diagnostic outcomes between commercial tests and the RBD&N|S1 rule were slightly
different, suggesting that previously infected SARS-CoV-2 individuals may be misdiagnosed by single
antigen-based tests (Figure 2B). In support, the absence of antibodies against certain SARS-CoV-2 antigens
is also apparent in studies that have compared assays targeting different antigens (6, 14-16); yet, the
biological basis of these observations is currently not well understood.
The rules-based approach combines single antigen readouts, using “AND” and “OR” logic rules, in order
to further enhance the specificity, accuracy and robustness of the multi-antigen assay. Such approaches
have already been shown to enhance the diagnostic performance of serological assays for common SARSCoV (17) and for SARS-CoV-2 (9). In our study, we showed that an optimally selected combination of
AND plus OR rules can increase specificity and accuracy, with little or no cost on sensitivity, for IgG and
total antibody detection in clinical samples (Table 1). After testing all potential rule combinations the
optimal rule was identified as the RBD&N|S1 (Table 1). The optimal rule utilized the best performing
readout (RBD antigen) whose specificity was further enhanced by requiring consensus (AND) with either

S1, N, or both readouts. Most importantly, the rules-based approach improved assay robustness (i.e. how
small deviations of the cut off value affect the diagnostic outcome). The RBD&N|S1 rule resulted in an
assay with robust performance across a wide range of cut-off values, compared to single-antigen assays,
suggesting that this multi-antigen combinatorial assay can achieve optimal performance at lower cut-offs
(Figure 1). It is worth noting that while multi-antigen rules exhibited improved performance in IgG and
total antibody detection, they did not improve the performance of the IgA and IgM assays (Table 1).
The use and application of our multiplex strategy in 1255 samples from randomly selected blood donors
aims to provide a dataset of experimental settings that mimic routine low-prevalence screening. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time a multi-antigen serological assay was applied to a seroprevalence
study. In contrast to clinical samples, where almost all positive donors showed high antibody titers for all
three antigens, a substantial number of donors revealed different responses against the N, S1 and RBD
antigens and only one of the 1,225 donors showed high antibody titers against all three antigens. With such
high dissensus between single-antigen responses, it is obvious that diagnosis of seroconversion in the
population becomes challenging. Even the highly concordant S1 and RBD antigens exhibited only 9%
agreement in their positive calls (6 out of 66 positive calls) (Figure 3B). One explanation for this
disagreement is that SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in population-wide screens are mostly
asymptomatic, with low antibody titers and unknown time since infection, during which antibodies to
specific epitopes may have already waned below the detection limit (18-20). Another important reason for
this large disagreement is the imperfect specificity of single-antigen assays, which can lead to a large
number of false predictions in a population screening (5). For example, assuming 1% seroprevalence and
100% sensitivity, the maximum observed 97.4% single-antigen specificity in the clinical performance study
would result in ~31 false positive predictions in the serosurvey, whereas just 12 samples are expected to be
truly positive (21). Based on this, we believe that the estimated 7.5% seroprevalence, which was observed
in Figure 3A at mean plus 3 SD with S1, may include mostly false positive predictions. The striking
differences in the seroconversion calls between antigens were reflected not only in the wide range of
estimated seroprevalence rates (0.6%-7.5%) but more importantly in the vastly different subsets of
potentially SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals (Figure 3B). Consistent to our findings, a side-by-side
comparison of three fully automated SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays (Abbott against N, Roche against N,
and DiaSorin against S1/S2 antigens) showed good agreement in 65 samples from COVID-19 patients, but
had profound discrepancies in positive predictions at 1% seroprevalence (22). Likewise, in an
epidemiological study in Iceland, out of the 18,609 individuals tested for total anti-N and anti-S1-RBD
antibodies using independent commercial kits, 158 were found positive for either N or S1-RBD but only
39 of them had antibodies against both epitopes (23). Similar discrepancies between N- and S1-specific
serological assays were observed in a large epidemiological study in Spain (24).
Our results have profound implications regarding seroprevalence rates presented by studies based on single
antigen assays, as well as for their diagnostic value. To achieve the most accurate estimate of
seroprevalence, an ideal 100% specific assay is required. One approach to increase specificity involves
raising the cut-off value of the assay, an approach that IVD manufacturers prefer to adopt to be on the safe
side regarding positive predictions. However, raising the cut-off value of single-antigen approaches can
lead to a profound underestimation of the seroprevalence rate (as shown in Figure 3A). A better approach
for accurate seroprevalence estimation would be confirmatory testing with an independent assay that uses
a different antigenic target (25). In this paper, we showed that the specificity of the multi-antigen assay can
be increased by using a consensus-based strategy, rather than increasing the cut-off value (Table 1). On this
front, our rules-based method achieved an almost consistent seroprevalence rate in a wide range of cut-off
values between 3 to 5 standard deviations above the mean (Figure 3A). Consequently, we believe that the
RBD&N|S1 rule combined with a mean plus 5 SD threshold provides a realistic estimation of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.20191122; this version posted October 9, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

seroprevalence in the community and accurate identification of seroconverted individuals. Notably, in our
study we used cut-off thresholds between 3 to 5 SDs whereas the manufacturer’s recommended 1.4 cut-off
value for the IgG N-specific Abbott test was calculated to correspond to more than 10 SDs above the
negative mean. Such high cut-off values can undermine sensitivity and result in the underestimation of the
true seroprevalence rate. When using the rules-based multiplex assay (RBD&N|S1) as reference the positive
predictive value of the IgG N-specific Abbot test was only 29% (2 out of 7 detected), despite both assays
showing excellent agreement in clinical samples (Supplementary Figure S7). An important limitation of
such comparisons between serological assays in population-wide surveys is the fact that there is no gold
standard method to identify the truly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive cases.
In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that serological assays based on single antigens, while good at
diagnosing infected individuals in a clinical setting, may not be ideal in low seroprevalence, populationwide COVID19 screens, where low antibody responses from mostly asymptomatic individuals are
expected. A multi-antigen approach combined with a rules-based framework for diagnostic decisions can
provide a better alternative in this context, through its enhanced specificity and reduced dependency on cutoff values. We believe that such multi-antigen approaches should be performed in a single multiplex assay,
thus diminishing possible differences attributed to operational issues of independent assay formats (11). An
added advantage of multiplexing is the reduced usage of resources and time. The embrace of multiplex
assays or multiple single antigen-based assays, by the scientific community, for epidemiological studies
can eventually lead to more accurate and reliable results regarding SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population.

Methods
Serum samples
A total of 155 clinical serum samples were analyzed, of which 78 were negative as were banked sera
collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (2018-2019) and 77 were positive samples from PCR-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 individuals collected at least two weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nineteen additional
serum samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 individuals were used for assay validation against other
commercial SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. For the general population screening, we obtained 1,225
serum samples between the 23rd and 25th week of 2020, e.g. 5 weeks after lockdown in Greece that took
place between the 13th and 18th week of 2020; blood donors were from 13 different geographical regions in
Greece (26% female; median age, 42 years; range, 17-65). Eligibility for donation included an extended
detailed questionnaire for previous possible signs of infection during 2020. All samples were acquired under
approved clinical protocols and informed consent (see Ethics statement). The detailed list of serum samples
used throughout the study is presented in Supplementary Table S2.

Multiplex immunoassay development and clinical performance analysis
A magnetic bead-based immunoassay was developed using the xMAP Luminex technology against SARSCoV-2 antigens N, S1 and RBD. Additionally, one antigen from each one of the four endemic coronaviruses
was also included in the assay. Specifically, the S1 subunit of HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63
and the S1+S2 subunits from HCoV-OC43 were used. For details regarding the optimization parameters
and technical specifications of the multiplex assay see Supplementary Material S1.1. The Median
Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) values of each SARS-CoV-2 antigen were first divided by the average MFI of
the negative control samples (made from a pool of negative sera) for the same antigen. Cut-off values for
determining the diagnostic outcome (positive/negative) regarding the presence (or not) of SARS-CoV-2
specific antibodies were calculated for each SARS-CoV-2 antigen based on its negative sample distribution.

Performance was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, while the corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Wilson approximation (26). The Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) analysis of the assay is presented in Supplementary Material S1.5.

Rules-based method
A rules-based method was developed to combine the readouts of the multi-antigen assay. First, the single
antigen “normalized MFI” values were transformed to positive/negative predictions by comparing them
with the appropriate cut-off value. Then, logic circuits that utilize the “AND” (represented by the symbol
“&”) and “OR” (represented by the symbol “|”) logic gates were implemented. These logic circuits take as
input the single-antigen predictions and output the final rules-based prediction that corresponds to a
positive/negative call for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. All possible simple circuits that
could be formed using the “AND” and “OR” logic gates to combine the predictions of the RBD, S1 and N
predictions were examined.

Assay validation
Assay validation was performed in two separate subsets of matched clinical samples against two widely
used, commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests developed by Euroimmun (Euroimmun
Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Lubeck, Germany) and Abbott (Abbott Diagnostics, Illinois, USA),
which detect IgG antibodies against S1 and N respectively (Supplementary Table S7). Single antigen
readouts for S1 and N from our IgG multiplex assay were plotted against the results of the commercial tests
and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated. For determining the diagnostic outcome
(positive/negative calls) we used the mean plus five SD cut-off values for our assays and the manufacturer’s
recommended cut-offs for the commercial assays (1.1 for Euroimmun and 1.4 for Abbott).

Population-level analysis
For the analysis of the 1,225 samples from blood donors, the total (IgG/IgA/IgM) assay was used, and the
diagnostic outcome was assessed across cut-off values ranging from mean plus 3 SD to mean plus 5 SD
from the negative sample distribution. To identify seroconverted individuals, the diagnostic outcomes using
the mean plus 5 SD cut off values were utilized. Frozen back-up samples (n=1,225) were sent to the
Immunology Laboratory of the National Public Health Organization, Athens, Greece and analyzed for the
presence of IgG antibodies against the N antigen using the Abbott IgG assay with the ARCHITECT
i2000SR analyzer (Abbott, Illinois, United States). The manufacturer’s recommended cut-off (1.4) was
used to determine positivity.
