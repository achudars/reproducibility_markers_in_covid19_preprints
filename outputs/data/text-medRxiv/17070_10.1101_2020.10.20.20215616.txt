Abstract

28

Background: During New Zealand’s first outbreak in early 2020 the Southern Region

29

had the highest per capita SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. PCR testing was initially limited

30

by a narrow case definition and limited laboratory capacity, so cases may have been

31

missed.

32

Objectives: To evaluate the Abbott® SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid assay, alongside

33

spike-based assays, and to determine the frequency of antibodies among PCR-

34

confirmed and probable cases, contacts, and higher risk individuals in the Southern

35

Region of NZ.

36

Study design: Pre-pandemic sera (n=300) were used to establish assay specificity and

37

sera from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=78) to establish sensitivity. For

38

prevalence analysis, all samples (n=1214) were tested on the Abbott assay, and all PCR-

39

confirmed cases (n=78), probable cases (n=9), and higher risk individuals with grey-

40

zone (n=14) or positive results (n=11) were tested on four additional SARS-CoV-2

41

serological assays.

42

Results: The median time from infection onset to serum collection for PCR-confirmed

43

cases was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks). The Abbott assay demonstrated a specificity

44

of 99.7% (95% CI, 98.2%-99.99%) and a sensitivity of 76.9% (95% CI, 66.0%-85.7%).

45

Spike-based assays demonstrated superior sensitivity ranging 89.7-94.9%. Nine

46

previously undiagnosed sero-positive individuals were identified, and all had

47

epidemiological risk factors.

48

Conclusions: Spike-based assays demonstrated higher sensitivity than the Abbott IgG

49

assay, likely due to temporal differences in antibody persistence. No unexpected SARS-

Introduction

53

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it

54

causes, COVID-19, were first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [1]. By 22

55

May 2020, there were nearly 5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, with

56

~336000 deaths [2]. During New Zealand’s (NZ) first outbreak (28 February to 22 May

57

2020) a total of 1154 PCR-confirmed and 350 probable cases were identified, with 22

58

COVID-19 related deaths [3].

59

This serological study is focused on the Southern District Health Board (SDHB) region

60

in NZ, which had the largest number of COVID-19 cases per capita during NZ’s first

61

outbreak (216 total cases; ~66/100,000 population), significantly higher than the

62

national average (~30/100,000) [3]. This region also includes the tourism hub of

63

Queenstown, where community transmission took place. PCR testing for SARS-CoV-

64

2 was initially restricted in NZ due to a narrow case definition and limited access to

65

diagnostic reagents.

66

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (henceforth referred to as PCR) from

67

a nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab or lower respiratory tract sample is the

68

gold standard method for detecting acute SARS-CoV-2 infection [4], whereas

69

serological tests can provide information on past infection [4]. The majority of SARS-

70

CoV-2 serological assays detect antibodies against spike (S) and/or nucleocapsid (N)

71

proteins [4]. Differing degrees of sequence conservation between N and S proteins

72

(including S1 and receptor binding domains (RBD)), and homologous proteins from

73

other coronaviruses, together with differences in the magnitude and kinetics of antibody

74

responses to these antigens may impact assay performance [5]. Several serological

75

assays are now commercially available, including for use on high-throughput, random

76

access analysers such as the Abbott Architect.

77

The aims of this study were threefold. Firstly, to investigate the sensitivity and

78

specificity of the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, based on the N protein,

79

together with several plate-based assays that utilise the S protein and/or S protein

80

domains. Secondly, to determine the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among

81

contacts of cases and other higher risk individuals in the SDHB region to determine

82

whether cases were missed during the outbreak. Thirdly, to assess the likelihood of

83

infection among those diagnosed as ‘probable’ cases.

84

Materials and Methods

85

Study Protocol

86

This study was performed at Southern Community Laboratories, in conjunction with

87

the SDHB, WellSouth (a primary healthcare organisation), University of Otago,

88

University of Auckland, and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research. It

89

was approved by the Health and Disability Ethics Committee (20/NTB/101).

90

PCR-confirmed cases, probable cases (PCR test negative or not performed, but

91

classified as a case based on their exposure history (household contact) and clinical

92

symptoms [3]), and their contacts were contacted for recruitment via the local public

93

health unit. The remaining higher risk individuals (frontline healthcare workers,

94

tourism workers, or Queenstown residents) were recruited via posters and media (print,

95

television, and social media). Participants completed a REDCap online survey [6]. The

96

questionnaire included demographic details and questions about which higher risk

97

category they associated with, if they had any contact with known COVID-19 cases,

98

and if they recalled having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 before or during the

lockdown period (alert level three and four, between 23rd March to May 12th 2020)

100

(Table 1). Blood samples were collected between 4th June and 4th August 2020.

101

The severity of COVID-19 in the PCR-confirmed group was classified on the basis of

102

their symptoms and the level of hospital care provided: 1 – asymptomatic to mild cold-

103

like symptoms (n=35); 2 – moderate: cough, fever and chills (n=39); 3 – moderately

104

severe: admitted for assessment (n=3); 4 – severe: admitted and given supplemental

105

oxygen therapy (n=1); 5 – critical: admitted to ICU (n=0).

106

To determine assay specificity, 300 de-identified antenatal sera collected from early-

107

mid 2019 (pre-pandemic), were used (after being stored at -20oC for up to 12 months).

108

Serological assays

109

The assays utilised are summarised in Table 2. The primary assay was the Abbott

110

Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA)

111

(Abbott, Chicago, USA). Samples were analysed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR

112

Immunoassay Analyzer following manufacturer’s instructions.

113

The in-house two-step ELISA was adapted from published protocols [7] as described

114

[8]. In step one serum diluted 1:100 was screened against RBD, with IgG binding

115

detected with a peroxidase-labelled anti-human IgG secondary. Samples with an optical

116

density (OD, 450-570nm) above the cut-off (>0.2) were titrated in a 3-fold dilution

117

series against the S protein in step two and considered positive if OD>0.2 in at least

118

two consecutive wells in the confirmatory S protein ELISA.

119

The Wantai SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise,

120

Beijing, China) and EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (EUROIMMUN AG,

121

Lübeck, Germany) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

122

The cPass® surrogate viral neutralisation test (sVNT) (GenScript, New Jersey, USA)

123

measures the presence of neutralising antibodies (NAbs) that are capable of blocking

124

the interaction between RBD and hACE2 [9] and was performed according to

125

manufacturer’s instructions. Samples with percentage inhibition ≥20% were defined as

126

having neutralising antibodies.

127

To assess cross-reactivity of antenatal sera with other human coronaviruses (HCoV),

128

ELISA were performed using S1 antigens from the HKU1, NL63, and SARS-CoV-2

129

(Sino Biological, Beijing, China) at 1:300 sera dilution as described [8].

130

Testing protocol

131

The antenatal samples and serum from PCR-confirmed and probable cases were tested

132

on all five assays. All sera from the higher risk group (n=1127) were tested on the

133

Abbott assay. Samples from the higher risk group that classified as positive (≥1.4 S/C),

134

or as negative but ≥ 0.5 S/C (i.e. 0.5–1.39 S/C, defined as the grey-zone on the basis of

135

a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) were tested on all assays (n=25).

136

Statistical analysis

137

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 8 (GraphPad) or R (version 3.6.3) within

138

R Studio (version 1.2.5033); a P-value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.

139

To assess sensitivity, we chose the PCR results as gold standard. Equivocal results were

140

considered negative for the statistical analyses. For the higher risk group, true sero-

141

positivity was defined by positivity in two or more of the five assays. False positivity

142

was defined as positivity in only one of the five assays.

Results

146

Participant characteristics

147

1214 individuals gave informed consent and participated in the study. Of these, 78 were

148

PCR-confirmed cases, nine were probable cases, and 1127 were in the higher risk

149

group. The median age of the mostly female (75%) participants was 46 years (range 4–

150

90 years) (Table 1). Of the 1127 higher risk participants, 37% had had a negative PCR

151

test, 62% self-identified as frontline healthcare workers in the southern region, and 56%

152

reported one or more symptoms in the two weeks prior to and during the February-May

153

COVID-19 outbreak. For the PCR-confirmed and probable cases, median time from

154

symptom onset to blood collection was 14 weeks (range 11-17 weeks).

155

Assay performance

156

Overall performance of the assays is summarised in Table 3. Specificity was high across

157

all assays ranging from 99.3% (95% CI, 97.6-99.9%) to 100% (95% CI, 98.8-100.0%).

158

The antenatal sera used to determine specificity showed broad reactivity with S1 protein

159

antigens from HCoV (HKU1 and NL63), but not SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary figure

160

1). Sensitivity ranged from 76.9% (95% CI: 66.0-85.7%) for the Abbott assay, to 94.9%

161

(95% CI, 87.4-98.6%) for the Wantai assay (Figure 1, Table 3). Eighteen (23.1%) PCR-

162

confirmed cases tested negative on the Abbott; raw values ranged from 0.14-1.39 S/C.

163

Eleven of these were positive on >3 other assays, four were positive on two other

164

assays, one was positive on one other assay, and two were negative on all other assays.

165

The sensitivity of the Abbott assay was unexpectedly low and prompted a ROC analysis

166

that showed a cut-off of 0.55 S/C could achieve much greater sensitivity (93.6%)

167

without a significant loss in specificity (98.7%) (Supplementary figure 2). A grey-zone

168

approach was therefore utilised for analysis of the higher risk and probable cases to rule

169

out potential false negatives: samples with 0.5–1.39 S/C were measured on the other

170

four assays.

171

Neutralising anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

172

The sVNT assay was used to measure NAbs. For the PCR-confirmed group, 88.5%

173

(69/78) had detectable NAbs. When the PCR-confirmed patients were stratified by

174

disease severity, there was a small but significant increase in the level of NAbs in those

175

with more severe disease (P < 0.05) (Supplementary figure 3).

176

Antibody detection among higher risk individuals

177

Eleven individuals of the higher risk group (0.98%) had positive results on the Abbott

178

assay (Figure 1). Eight of these were also positive on >1 other assays, indicating true

179

sero-positivity. Three Abbott positive results were considered false positives as they

180

were negative on all four other assays. There were fourteen Abbott results that fell in

181

the grey-zone (0.5 – 1.39 S/C). Thirteen (93%) were negative on all other assays and

182

classified as sero-negative. One individual was positive on all four other assays and

183

considered sero-positive.

184

Thus, in total we detected nine additional possible COVID-19 infections: one was a

185

PCR-confirmed case diagnosed outside of the Southern region; six had consistent travel

186

history (Western Europe/UK) and symptoms; and two were close contacts of PCR-

187

confirmed cases reporting consistent symptoms.

188

Antibody detection among probable cases

189

Of the nine probable cases, one was positive on four of five assays while another was

190

positive on three of five assays, suggesting likely infection (Figure 1). The remaining

191

seven were negative by all assays, and the Abbott assay raw values of these ranged from

192

0.01 – 0.04 S/C, suggesting that these were unlikely to have had COVID-19 infection.

193

Discussion

194

Using a cohort of PCR-confirmed cases to assess sensitivity, we found suboptimal

195

performance of the Abbott assay at 11-17 weeks post infection with a sensitivity of

196

76.9%, lower than previously published data [10-12] and manufacturer’s claim (100%

197

after 14 days). It is likely two factors contributed to this. Firstly, most of the cases in

198

the SDHB region were not hospitalised, and there is evidence that antibody levels

199

correlate with disease severity [13]. Secondly, a median of 14 weeks (range 11-17

200

weeks) had lapsed between symptom onset and serum collection; N protein antibodies

201

are reported to decline relatively quickly post-infection [14]. In contrast, the sensitivity

202

of plate-based assays based on S protein was higher (89.7-94.9%), which is in keeping

203

with reports that antibodies against S protein persist for longer than those to N protein

204

[14].

205

In our hands, the Abbott assay specificity was 99.7% (95% CI, 98.2%-99.99%),

206

comparable to the manufacturer’s claim (99.6%). However, given the very low

207

prevalence of COVID-19 infection in NZ, the positive-predictive value will be

208

relatively low. Thus, we suggest an orthogonal testing algorithm (a second assay, using

209

a different target) as a supplemental assay before reporting results as true positives.

210

S protein is the main target for SARS-CoV-2 NAbs [15]. In this study NAbs were

211

measured using a sVNT [9] with 88.5% of the PCR-confirmed cases having detectable

212

NAbs 11-17 weeks post-infection, with lower NAbs among those with mild symptoms.

213

A decline in NAb levels has been noted in recent reports [13], but further studies are

214

needed to fully understand these immunokinetics and implications for protection

215

against reinfection.

216

This study of 1127 individuals who self-identified as being higher risk for SARS-CoV-

217

2 infection identified a further nine infections (0.8%). Of these, all had epidemiological

218

risks including travel to Europe during their outbreak and/or being a close contact of a

219

known case. Undiagnosed infection was not detected among front-line healthcare

220

workers, tourism workers, and casual contacts of known cases. It is possible that cases

221

of infection may have been missed as the Abbott assay, which was used as our initial

222

screening assay, demonstrated sub-optimal sensitivity. However, the grey-zone

223

approach utilised, based on a ROC analysis, improved the sensitivity to 94.9%.

224

Given the imperfect sensitivity, and unknown prevalence among the tested population

225

in our region, it is difficult to estimate the true number of cases of infection that may

226

have been missed. The Rogan-Gladen estimator [16] allows us to estimate the actual

227

prevalence in the higher risk group, considering the uncertainties in the sensitivity and

228

specificity of the test. Using a threshold of 1.4 S/C, the estimated actual prevalence in

229

the higher risk group is 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0-2.0%). Using a threshold of 0.5 S/C, the

230

estimated actual prevalence is 2.0% (95% CI: 0.8-3.2%). To incorporate the effect of

231

secondary orthogonal testing, it is convenient to carry out a Bayesian statistical analysis

232

(see Flor et al [17] for a recent discussion of Bayesian methods in prevalence

233

estimation). Applying the secondary tests to the eleven samples that tested positive with

234

a threshold of 1.4 S/C, the estimated actual prevalence in the higher-risk group is 0.9%

235

(95% credible interval: 0.4-1.7%). Applying the secondary tests to the 25 samples that

236

tested positive with a threshold of 0.5 S/C, the estimated actual prevalence is 0.8% (95%

237

credible interval: 0.4-1.5%). The value of orthogonal testing is two-fold: (i) we obtain

238

more precise estimates of actual prevalence, (ii) the estimates do not appear to depend

239

strongly on the threshold used in the primary test, as evidenced by the concordance of

240

the obtained estimates.

241

An unexpected finding was that seven of the nine individuals diagnosed with ‘probable’

242

infection and included in NZ’s official tally were sero-negative despite being tested on

243

all five assays. While acknowledging the delay (approximately three months) in serum

244

collection and the possible impact on sensitivity, it is highly likely that at least some of

245

these individuals did not have infection. This highlights the role of serology in the

246

diagnostic algorithm where PCR is negative despite symptoms and epidemiological

247

risks; further testing of NZ’s remaining 341 probable cases may be warranted.

248

Our study has some limitations. Firstly, the delay in specimen collection after the

249

outbreak likely had an impact on the Abbott assay sensitivity. We cannot be certain that

250

undiagnosed cases were not missed using the Abbott assay as our screening test.

251

However, every effort was made to mitigate against this by lowering the cut-off for the

252

initial Abbott screening assay. Lastly, it is important to note that this is not a sero-

253

prevalence study. Participants who self-identified as higher risk were actively recruited,

254

therefore the sero-positivity rate calculated in this group in the SDHB region cannot be

255

extrapolated to the general population.

256

Conclusion

257

In conclusion, our study shows that the COVID-19 outbreak in the SDHB region in

258

early 2020 was largely confined to the PCR-confirmed cases and those identified as at

259

higher risk due to recent travel and/or close contact with a known case. We found little

260

evidence of undetected infection among the individuals in the SDHB region who were

261

close contacts identified by Public Health, or whose job or place of residence placed

262

them at higher risk. The N protein based Abbott assay demonstrated the lowest

263

sensitivity of the assays investigated, likely impacted by the delay in serum collection.

264

Whilst this may lead to missed cases, the utility of a high throughput system for large

265

scale testing does, to a degree, offset this significant limitation, especially when

266

combined with secondary S protein assays of higher sensitivity. When designing a

267

SARS-CoV-2 serological assay algorithm, the purpose of testing is a major

268

consideration, with different assay combinations suitable for high-throughput sero-

269

prevalence purposes versus individual level clinical diagnostics.
