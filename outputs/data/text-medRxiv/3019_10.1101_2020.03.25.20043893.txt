Abstract
Background: Exponential-like infection growths leading to peaks (which could be the inflection
points or turning points) are usually the hallmarks of infectious disease outbreaks including
coronaviruses. To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection
number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and
explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to
sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to
obtain satisfactory results.
Method: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power
law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks.
The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general
DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two “secondary” parameters (computed from its 3 parameters
including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually
exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was
originally used for estimating the potential or ‘dark’ biodiversity is proposed to estimate the
maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding
inflection time point (Tmax).
Results: We successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces (≈85%)
in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and
limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring
sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.

Introduction
In spite of the obviously extreme importance and extensive research efforts, predicting the
inflection points, formally known as the tipping points or turning points in much of the existing
literature, turned out to be notoriously difficult. The enormous complexity associated with
tipping points and critical transitions make accurate predictive modeling nearly impossible.
Existing theories suggest that early warning signals (EWS) may be developed based on the
phenomenon that recovery rates from small disturbances should tend to zero when approaching a
tipping point (Scheffer et al. 2009, 2015), and some laboratory experiments and field survey
have demonstrated the so-called “critical slow down” (CSD) phenomenon (e.g., Veraart et al.
2012, Dakos et al. 2015).
In theory, it has been suggested that even without fully mechanistic understanding of the
underlying critical transitions, it is still possible to infer generic features or early warning signals
(EWS) of approaching a tipping point from time series or spatial pattern data. Theory proposes
that at bifurcation points (i.e., tipping points), the stability of an equilibrium changes and the
dominant real eigenvalue becomes zero. Consequently, the recovery rate from disturbance
should go zero when approaching such bifurcation, or the return time (measure of resilience)
should be infinity (Veraart et al. 2012). In practice, the recovery rate from disturbance may be an
indicator of the distance to a tipping point, and its manifestation, the CSD offer important early
EWS for approaching a tipping point.
Investigating the inflection points of infectious disease outbreaks including the ongoing
coronaviruses pandemic falls under the domain of tipping points and critical transitions (Veraart
et al. 2012, Dakos et al. 2015, Scheffer et al. 2009, 2015). However, in a pre-experiment analysis
of the existing datasets of COVID-19 infections, we failed to detect any tipping points (inflection
points). We conjecture that the failure may have to do with the insufficiently long duration of
data collections. We then also tried some simple epidemiological modeling approaches such as
simple logistic model (e.g., Ma et al. 2009) but still failed to achieve satisfactory results.
Inspired by the exponential-like growth of infections leading to peaks, which seems to be a
hallmark of many infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19 and SARS (Rivers et al.
2019, Li et al. 2020, Thompson 2020, Ma 2020), we try the PLEC (power law with exponential
cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points in the time series data of COVID-19. The PLEC

model (function) starts with power function increase (near exponential growth usually) and it has
an exponential decay term that acts as taper-off parameter to eventually overwhelm the power
law behavior at very large value of independent variable. The PLEC model was previously used
to describe the classic species-area relationship (SAR) in biogeography (Plotkin et al. 2000,
Ulrich & Buszko 2003), and later used for extending the classic SAR and STR (species-time
relationship) to general diversity-area relationship (DAR) and diversity-time relationship (DTR)
(Ma 2018a, 2018b, 2019). Furthermore, Ma (2018a, 2018b, 2019) derived the formula to
estimate the maximal accrual diversity (MAD) in space (area), time, and/or spatiotemporal
settings, which may also be used to estimate potential diversity (also known as “dark” diversity).
The potential or dark diversity refers to the biodiversity that take into accounts the contribution
of species that are absent locally but potentially present in regional species pool. This situation of
potential species migration from regional (metacommunity) to local community is not unlike the
COVID-19 infections via dispersal (migration) such as travelers of virus-infected individuals.
We postulate that the PLEC model can be useful for modeling the infection-time relationship
(ITR)—the relationship between the cumulative number of infections and time points (e.g., day
1, 2,……,N). If the PLEC model successfully fits to the ITR datasets, we further postulate that
the maximal accrual diversity or potential diversity and corresponding time point may be
translated into an approach for estimating the maximal infection number (Imax) of an outbreak and
the corresponding time point (when Imax is reached) as estimate of inflection time point (Tmax).
Together the pair of {Imax, Tmax} is defined as the inflection point of a disease outbreak in this
study. We further devised schemes to test the performance of the PLEC model in predicting
(estimating) the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks.

Material and Methods
The PLEC model (Power Law with Exponential Cutoff)
A hallmark of coronaviruses outbreaks seems to be exponential or near exponential growth of
infections, and the peak time and amplitude or the outbreak inflection points of the virus are of
obvious importance both theoretically and practically. We address this problem with a trial-anderror strategy. We first conjectured that simple logistic growth model could be a possible
solution since its asymptotic limit (K) might be used to approximate the inflection points (Ma et
al. 2009). We also tried sophisticated mathematical approaches for detecting tipping points (Dai
et al. 2012, 2013, Sundstrom et al. 2017). However, the applications of both logistic growth
model and tipping point approaches failed to generate satisfactory results.

In the present report, we adopt the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for
estimating the inflection points of coronavirus infections. The PLEC model is of the following
form:

I = cT w exp(dT) .

(1)

The model was initially used by Plotkin et al (2000) and Ulrich & Buszko (2003) for modeling
the classic species-area relationship (SAR). Ma (2018a, 2018b, 2019) introduced it for more
€
general diversity-area relationship (DAR), diversity-time relationship (DTR) and diversity-timearea (DTAR) relationship. Another extension to the model was the derivation of two parameters
by Ma (2018a, 2018b, 2019): the maximal accrual diversity and corresponding time or space
points. The maximal accrual diversity can be used to estimate the so-termed potential diversity
(also known as “dark” diversity), which takes into accounts of the species that are absent locally
(in local communities) but present regionally (in metacommunities) (Ma 2019, Li & Ma 2019).
In the present report, we use the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model (eqn. 1) for
modeling the growth of COVID-19 infections. With eqn. (1), T is the time or days (starting from
a specified date), and I is the number of cumulative infections, c, d, and w are three parameters to
be estimated from the observed data. Ma (2018a) derived the maximum of eqn. (1) by solving
the following equation:
'
df (I)
= [cT w exp(dT)] = 0
dT

(2)

w
w
Imax = c(− ) w exp(−w) = cTmax
exp(−w)
d

(3)

which leads to:

€

Tmax = − w d

(w>0, d<0)

(4)

Theoretically, eqns. (3) & (4) can be utilized to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and
€
corresponding inflection time point (Tmax) at which Imax occurs.
€
Parameter d is of particular interests: exp(dT) in eqn. (1) is the exponential decay term that acts
as taper-off parameter to eventually overwhelm the power law behavior (exponential or near
exponential growth) at very large value of T. For eqn. (1) to achieve maximum of realistic
biomedical meaning (Tmax>0) or (w>0 & d<0) are necessary conditions.

The biological interpretation of parameter w & c can best be observed by assuming d→0. When
d=0, the PLEC defaults to classic power-law model,
(5)

I = cT w

or its log-transformed linear model:
(6)
ln(I) = ln(c) + w ln(T) ,
€
in which w is the slope of the log-linear model or the derivative of I(T), i.e., the change (growth)

rate of infections over time, and c is the initial infection number. Since the taper-off effects of
€
parameter d is usually rather weak before the infection peaks, it is reasonable to consider w as an
approximation of the infection growth rate, and c as an approximation of the initial infection
number.
A simple method to statistically fit the PLEC model [eqn. (1)] is to transform it into a log-linear
equation as follows:
ln(I) = ln(c) + w ln(T) + dT

(7)

For eqn. (7), simple linear regression can be used to fit the model and hence obtain the PLEC
parameters. Nevertheless, the simple linear regression may not provide satisfactory fitting to the
€
original PLEC model [eqn. (1)], especially when the number of data points for fitting the model
is small or moderate. For this reason, we use the nonlinear optimization method to fit the PLEC
model [(eqn.1)] directly, rather than fitting the log-linear transformed equation [eqn. (7)]
indirectly. We used nonlinear optimization method, specifically the R function “nlsLM” from R
package “minpack.lm” (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/minpack.lm/versions/1.2-1/topics/nlsLM)
(Bates & Watts 1988). Since only Tmax>0 (negative time is meaningless to count infections) is a
necessary condition for the PLEC model to be biometrically sound, we add a constraint d<0 for
the non-linear fitting of PLEC model.
It is particularly worthy of noticing that the dependent variable (I) of PLEC, almost unavoidably,
declines after the inflection point (maximum) due to the taper-off parameter (d). Nevertheless,
this should not be an issue in the case of this study, since our purpose is to detect the inflection
point (Tmax) as well as the corresponding maximum (Imax). In other words, the declining piece of
PLEC curve after the inflection point is “irrelevant” for our purpose. Of course, this also implies
that our model is only applicable to unimodal (single peak) outbreak.

We collected the daily infections datasets of COVID-19 in 34 Chinese provinces and the world
from the public domain. In addition, we collected the datasets of 17 cities of Hubei province of
China. The infection data between Jan 19th and Feb 29th were collected for building the
predictive PLEC model, and the infection data at two time points (March 6th and 12th) as the test
data points to evaluate the performance of the PLEC model in determining the inflection points.
The public websites used to get the data include: https://news.qq.com/zt2020/page/feiyan.htm#/
and https://news.ifeng.com/c/special/7tPlDSzDgVk.
We test the performance of the proposed PLEC model with two schemes. First, we evaluate the
“congruency” of Tmax (inflection time point) with the reality by comparing the actually observed
infection number at the date of Tmax with the estimated Imax. To determine the congruence, we
calculate an interval [Imax−Imaxx0.05; Imax+Imaxx0.05] for each PLEC model. If the actually
observed infection numbers falls within the interval, the estimation of Tmax is considered as valid.
It is noted that this is not a classic confidence interval, which requires the calculation of standard
deviation of samples and cannot be obtained in the case of COVID-19 infections. Instead, this
“homegrown” interval we computed is simply a range of Imax with 5% fluctuation, which we
believe is a reasonable scheme for estimating the validity of the Tmax estimations.
Second, to evaluate the validity of Imax estimations, we used the observed infection number on
the day of Tmax, March 6th and March 12th, respectively, as reference values to evaluate the
performance of the PLEC model, using the following formula to calculate the error rate:
E(%) = (Imax − I) /Imax .

(8)

Alternatively, the precision P(%) of the PLEC model is simply computed as the complement of
E(%), i.e., P(%)=1–E(%).

Results
We fitted the PLEC model with the nonlinear optimization method (i.e., the R-function ‘nlsLM’
introduced in the previous “The Model” section) to each of the 17 cities in Hubei province, each
of the 34 provinces of China, as well as the whole China and worldwide infections datasets. The
results were displayed in Table 1 (the PLEC model-fitting results) and Table 2 (test of the model
performance). Since the model mostly failed to make meaningful predictions of the infections
outside China, we postpone the worldwide results to the “Discussion” section and here we focus
on the results fitted to the datasets in China.

Listed in Table 1 included the PLEC parameters (w, d, c) and the p-values [w(p), d(p), c(p)] from
estimating the corresponding parameters. These p-values measure the significance levels for
estimating these parameters: a p-value<0.05 indicating that the goodness-of-fitting to the model
is statistically satisfactory from the perspective of the particular parameter. R2 (R-squared) is of
limited reference value for non-linear fitting problem, but it also confirmed the goodness-offitting as illustrated by the p-values for individual parameters. Obviously, the most important
items in Table 1 are the Imax and corresponding Tmax, the maximal infection number (eqn. 3) and
the corresponding inflection time point (eqn. 4), respectively.
Table 1 shows that PLEC fitted to virtually all datasets satisfactorily in terms of the p-values
except for a few negligible parameter cases (p-value>0.05 in 4 out of 52). It should be noted that
the 4 parameter cases that failed to pass significance tests only means that the parameter values
may have too high standard error (variability) and the failure does not necessarily mean that the
model structure failed. Therefore, the model could still be used for estimating Tmax and Imax, as
long as the tests with actual observations are satisfactory, as explained below. Fig 1 shows an
example of fitting the PLEC model based on the total infections in China from January 12th to
February 29th.
On the whole model level, the datasets of Tibet (Xizang) and Taiwan failed to fit the PLEC
model. The failure for Tibet dataset is expected since there was only one infection case and
fitting a model is neither necessary nor possible; hence it was excluded from the performance
evaluation. The failure to fit the infection data of Taiwan is unknown, and we instead included it
in the performance evaluation as failed estimations.
Table 2 listed the results from evaluating the validity of Tmax (the left side) and Imax (the right
side). Regarding Tmax, the PLEC model correctly estimated the occurrences of inflection time
points in 88% (15 out of 17 cities) in Hubei province, and 85% (29 out of 34 provinces) at the
national level in China. Regarding Imax, the success rates for the 17 cities in Hubei provinces
were 88%, 100%, & 100% respectively, in terms of the observed infection numbers at the dates
of Tmax, March 6th and March 12th, respectively. Regarding Imax for the 34 provinces in China, the
success rates were 85%, 85%, & 82% respectively, in terms of the observed infection numbers at
the dates of Tmax, March 6th and March 12th, respectively.

In summary, the test results suggest that the proposed PLEC model successfully estimated the
inflection points in terms of both {Tmax & Imax}, i.e., the inflection time points and maximal
infection numbers, in more than 80% tested cases (ranged between 82%-100%). Note that the
date range we used to build PLEC models was between January 19 and February 29th, rather than
the full date range available, and the datasets of the remaining dates were used for evaluating the
performance of PLEC models.
Figs 2 shows both the observed and estimated maximal infection numbers {Imax} for each of the
34 provinces of China, as well as the total national number (the last pair of bars). Fig 4 shows the
corresponding inflection time points {Tmax} of each province displayed in Fig 2. Fig 3 shows the
observed and estimated maximal infection numbers {Imax} for each of the 17 cities of Hubei
province of China, as well as the total provincial number (the last pair of bars). Fig 5 shows the
corresponding inflection time points {Tmax} of each city.

Discussion
In this section, by analyzing the failures of PLEC case by case, we try to uncover the model’s
limitations. We first examine the failure exposed in previous Tables 1 & 2.
In Tables 1 & 2, the PLEC model for Shandong province performed badly with error rates about
11% was apparently due to the sudden discovery of approximately 200 cases in a local prison on
a single day (Feb 20), which was approximately 1/5 of the total number in the province. The
model for Gansu province also performed badly with error rates of 36%, apparently due to 33
inputs from the overseas between March 4th and 8th, approximately 1/3 of the total number in the
province. These individual cases suggest that the PLEC modeling can be sensitive to certain
disruptive increases, in particular, to the increases that occupy disproportionally large proportion
of the total numbers. This may be considered as the first limitation of the PLEC model. On the
positive side, excluding the inaccuracies from these disruptive increases as well as the individual
cases of Taiwan and Tibet, the PLEC model actually performed exceptionally well, reaching
success rates mostly exceeding 95%.
We also fitted the PLEC model to the infection datasets of at least 14 countries (top 14 in terms
of the infection numbers until March 15th) as well as the worldwide total infection number, and
total worldwide infection number excluding China. Overall, in a majority of the cases, the PLEC

model failed to obtain satisfactory predictions for the inflection points measured in {Tmax, Imax}.
To save page space, portions of the modeling results were supplied in Fig S1 of the OSI (Online
Supplementary Information). From those failures, we conjecture that the failures are most likely
due to the reality that in most of those countries (regions), the infections are still in the
exponential growth stages. This, of course, suggests another possible limitation of the PLEC
model, namely, the PLEC model may require a sufficiently long period of data points to
successfully reveal the inflection points. Like all mathematical models, PLEC model is no silver
bullet. Without seeing a sign of inflection point, it may not be possible for the PLEC model to
reveal its existence.
Still a third limitation of the PLEC model is that it may only detect a single inflection point for a
dataset. In other words, it is only applicable for detecting the inflection point for unimodal curve,
as explained in the material and methods section. In the case of coronaviruses, this may not be an
issue given that the SARS outbreak was also unimodal. In case of multiple-peak recurrence or
seasonal outbreaks, it should be possible to divide multi-modal curve into multiple unimodal
curves. Therefore, this limitation should be much less serious than it appears.
Given the above-discussed limitations of the PLEC model, we also applied the tipping point
detection technique based on Fisher information (Sundstrom et al. 2017) for determining the
inflection points, but failed to detecting any inflection (tipping) points in the datasets of COVID19 infections. As shown in Table S1, virtually all Fisher Information (FI) values at every time
window of the time series of COVID-19 equal 4, which indicates no existence of tipping points.
This additional exploratory analysis not only revealed the difficulty of the problem for detecting
the inflection points, but also suggested the value of PLEC model given that it successfully
estimated the inflection points in terms of both {Tmax & Imax} on the city, provincial and national
scales in China. To some extent, the failures of PLEC model at large scales of country should
mostly due to the limitation of currently available datasets, rather than the model per se.
Finally, we would like to mention one potentially very important point regarding the prediction
of inflection points, but is beyond the scope of this study, that is, the potentially critical
influences of public-health intervention/prevention measures on the occurrences of inflection
points. Such a study may only be possible after the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic is over in
our opinion.
