Abstract
Background: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay local SARS-CoV-2
community transmission in a previously unaffected country.
Methods: We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARSCoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the
effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the
COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom
onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the
number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of
secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and
secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers
and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable
in each scenario and an inner 50% interval.
Results: Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with
traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14
days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The
additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only
exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13
days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of
importation, these delays shrink rapidly to less than 4 days.
Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have
marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.

Background
Similar to outbreaks of other respiratory pathogens (1‚Äì4), syndromic airport screening at arrival
of travellers from regions with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unlikely to identify a
sufficient proportion of infected travellers to prevent global spread (5,6). Sensitising arriving
travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and encouraging appropriate reactions
(e.g., early self-isolation, requesting medical assistance via telephone, reporting travel history to
providers to trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts), may have a more pronounced effect and
has been implemented in many transport hubs (7). Unfortunately, with increasing numbers of
infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the
immensely resource-intensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent
local transmission in the long term (8).
Even if containment is ultimately impossible, delaying local spread remains a key target of
pandemic response (9). This will allow additional time for preparation of the health system and
mobilisation of additional public health resources. Delaying local spread will also allow for
crucial time to better understand the pathogen and to evaluate effective treatment and
prevention measures.
We aim to estimate the effectiveness of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation for
delaying the onset of sustained SARS-CoV-2 spread in previously unaffected regions.

Methods
Infected Traveller Arrivals Model
We represent the potential importation of infections by a non-homogeneous Poisson process
with intensity function,  , representing the instantaneous rate of arrival of infected travellers
(per week), and that the travellers are attempting to travel to a specific country or region
currently not experiencing an outbreak. Implicitly, the number of infected travellers is a product
of the prevalence and the number of travellers per week. We assume that individuals with
severe symptoms do not attempt to travel, though travellers may develop severe symptoms en
route (6).
For early stages of an outbreak, with sufficient control measures in place at the source of the
outbreak to flatten or reverse the spread, it may be reasonable to assume a constant arrival
rate. Instead we assume that   grows from an initial rate, ‡¨¥ infected travellers per week,
when measures to limit the spread from imported cases are introduced. The assumed
exponential growth rate of   0.1 (95% CI, 0.050-0.16) corresponds to an epidemic doubling
time of 7.4 days (95% interval: 4.2-14 days), in line with the local epidemic growth during
attempted control via contact tracing but without a lockdown (10). We consider that the epidemic
grows exponentially at the source during the early phase of the outbreak when the population is
effectively entirely susceptible. In addition to their use in modelling the risk of exportation of

SARS-CoV-2 (11) and turning points for daily case trends in SARS-CoV (12), nonhomogeneous Poisson processes, particularly those with decreasing inter-arrival times, have
previously been applied to a range of infectious disease settings for investigating the
effectiveness of border control (13), estimating epidemic parameters (14) and assessing
scheduling in mass immunisation clinics for pandemic Influenza (15).

Outbreak Probability Model
Upon arrival, we assume all infected travellers have the same distribution of the number of
onwards infections they would generate if circulating in the community. These potential
secondary infections are determined by the average number of those infections, ‡¨¥ , the basic
reproduction number, and the dispersion of that number, .
Following Hartfield and Alizon (16), we calculate the probability that an arriving infected traveller
causes an outbreak, given ‡¨¥ and dispersion parameter, , by solving the first equation in their
Supplementary Material S.3,

(Eq. 1)

for , the probability that an outbreak is triggered by an arriving traveller (Hartfield and Alizon
parameterise this in terms of   1   the probability of extinction of an outbreak).
Having obtained  for a given simulation we calculate ‡¨¥ , the number of infected travellers
required to trigger the outbreak from a geometric distribution with probability  , sampling the
  0,1 quantile of said distribution to match initial conditions between intervention scenarios
across simulation samples. We assume that the arrival times of infected travellers follows a
non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity    ‡¨¥  ‡Ø•‡Øß ‚ÅÑ7, where ‡¨¥ ‚ÅÑ7 is the arrival rate
of infected travellers (per day) when the interventions are introduced at   0 and the rate of
increase, , is sampled from a Gamma distribution with 95% interval (0.05, 0.16) representing
the growth early in the Wuhan outbreak (10). Additionally, because ‡¨¥ is uncertain, this leads to
uncertainty in q and variability in ‡¨¥ beyond the stochasticity from the arrival process. This
exponential growth rate is consistent with a case doubling times of: 5 days (95% interval: 4.3,
6.2 days) found by Ferretti et al. (17) which would give a growth rate of approximately 0.14; and
that of 6.4 days (5.8, 7.1 days) by Wu et al. (18) giving a growth rate of 0.11 days. We have
chosen to parameterise in terms of the exponential growth rate of the epidemic rather than the
doubling time of cases to account for recovery at the travel origin.

Model of symptom screening and sensitisation
When syndromic screening is implemented, each arriving infected traveller is identified during
screening with probability 1   , reducing the number of infected travellers arriving and
potentially delaying the outbreak. For the scenarios we consider, we assume the same baseline
assumptions as in Quilty et al (6); i.e. a syndromic screening sensitivity of 86%, travel duration
of 12 hours, and average times from infection to onset of symptoms and from onset to severe

symptoms/hospitalisation as 5.2 and 9.2 days, respectively. For those assumptions, Quilty et al
estimate the mean probability of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers not being detected at either
exit or entry screening as 46% and as 42% for exit-only screening. Here we consider the
uncertainty in Œ∏ by bootstrap resampling 100 travellers per simulation from the model of Quilty
et al. and obtain 95% confidence intervals of (33%, 53%) and (37%, 57%) respectively. As in
that paper, the benefit of entry screening is dependent on the effectiveness of exit screening,
and entry-only screening is likely to pick up those who would have been identified by exit
screening.
Sensitisation occurs via, e.g., posters and handouts to travellers arriving from high risk regions,
which increases the likelihood that those travellers, if they experience SARS-CoV-2 symptoms,
will self-isolate on the occurrence of mild symptoms and rapidly report to health care providers
who in turn trigger contact tracing (8). We represent traveller sensitisation as reducing ‡¨¥ to
  1   ‡¨¥ , where  is interpreted as the effectiveness of sensitisation, rather than the
proportion of passengers perfectly sensitised. The lower  results in a lower probability that an
arriving infected traveller triggers an outbreak,  , and therefore it may require the entry of more
infected travellers,    , to trigger the outbreak than in the no-sensitisation case, resulting in
a correspondingly longer time to outbreak in the Poisson process.
As a base case for the intervention, we consider recent work (5) which indicates that
sensitisation by itself may cause only 25% of those symptomatically infected with SARS-CoV-2
to self-report upon onset of symptoms. In line with Hellewell et al (8) we assume, for sensitivity,
a best case scenario that these measures accelerate self-isolation and reporting in the early
stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and reduce the average number of onward transmitting
secondary infections by about 50%.

Calculation of delays to reach outbreak threshold
To determine the impact of the interventions, we calculate the difference in time to outbreak
occurrence with and without interventions:   ‡¨¥ . For the correct comparison, these times must
be drawn as matched quantiles,   0,1. To ensure that, we calculate ‡¨¥ and  from the
same ‡¨¥ draw (reduced to  by sensitisation and contact tracing ) and calculate the probability
of an individual traveller causing an outbreak without and with interventions,  and ,
respectively. We then generate arrival times from Poisson processes with rate   and
determine how long it takes for ‡¨¥ infected travellers to arrive in the base case and  to arrive in
the screened queue. Arrival times are generated using the reda package (19) in R 3.6.2.

We report the median delay and inner 50% and 95% intervals and plot the empirical
complementary cumulative probability densities to show how many simulations result in a delay
of at least a given duration given , ‡¨¥ , ,  .

Scenarios considered
We considered three syndromic screening intervention scenarios: no screening, exit-only, and
exit-and-entry screening. We further considered two scenarios of the effectiveness of traveller
sensitisation: 0% and a reasonable average case of 25%. No screening and 0% sensitisation
effectiveness form the non-intervention reference. These are reported in the context of either
0.1, 1, 10 or 100 infected travellers per week at the time of measures being introduced. We
assume that the mean ‡¨¥ is gamma distributed with an inner 95% range from 1.4 to 3.9 (10); we
assume, for the calculation of probability of outbreak triggering, the dispersion in secondary
cases is k=0.54 (20).
For sensitivity analyses, we also investigate alternative scenarios for the dispersion of ‡¨¥ and a
reasonable best case of 50% effectiveness of contact tracing and self-reporting. All scenarios
and parameters are summarised in Table 1.
All analyses were done with R 3.6.2 (21) and can be found on GitHub at

Figure 1: Schematic of the air traveller intervention process. A proportion of infected travellers (red dots) will be
detected through syndromic exit or entry screening (green arrows) and will immediately be isolated and not cause
secondary cases (yellow dots) in the yet unaffected destination. Travellers not identified by syndromic screening
enter the destination country (red arrows), where they are provided by sensitisation information and are more likely to
self-isolate and/or report their symptoms soon after onset and cause fewer secondary cases (dots which are yellow
under ‚Äúdelayed contact tracing‚Äù but grey under ‚Äúrapid contact tracing‚Äù).

Results
For all scenarios investigated, the lower bound of the 95% interval is always less than 1 day of
delay (Table 2). Where sensitisation has been performed ( either 25% or 50%), the sampled
value of  may be less than 1; for such values, the outbreak is averted. Where the upper bound
of the 95% interval is infinite, this indicates that at least 2.5% of outbreaks have been averted.
Here we present results in terms of their median and inner 50% interval and only present the
upper bounds of the 95% interval when they are finite. The percentage of outbreaks averted for
all combinations of and  are given in Table S1.
In the case of 1 infected traveller per week at the time of the intervention, the combination of
traveller sensitisation and exit and entry screening typically delays the outbreak by 8 days (inner
50% interval: 3-14 days) (Table 2, Figure 2). If there are 10 infected travellers per week at the
time of these interventions being introduced, the outbreak is typically delayed by only 2 days
(50%: <1-5 days). At ‡¨¥  100the median delay is less than 1 day, and less than 25% of delays
are longer than 1 day.
Additional figures in the appendix show the complementary cumulative density functions,
focusing on either variation with screening (Figure S1), traveller sensitisation (Figure S2),
arrival rate (Figure S3), or dispersion parameter (Figure S4).
The incremental benefit of syndromic entry screening is highly dependent on the effectiveness
of exit screening. With one infected traveller per week, traveller sensitisation, and under
baseline assumptions of exit screening effectiveness but no entry screening, the outbreak is
delayed by 2 days (50%: <1-13 days), indicating that additional entry screening adds little in this
case.

We estimate that with no traveller sensitisation and under baseline assumptions for the

of sensitisation was 25%. In the early stages of the outbreak with 1 infected traveller per week
at the time the intervention is introduced, an outbreak may be delayed by screening alone by
only 4 days (50%: <1-9 days). Again, this is largely due to exit screening at departure, which on
its own is estimated to delay the outbreak by 3 days (50%: <1-8 days). Forgoing screening
measures until a rate of arrival of 10 infected travellers per week, essentially eliminates any
potential delay in onset of a local outbreak; specifically, if infected traveller numbers approach
10 per week, syndromic screening alone can only delay the outbreak by 1 day (50%: <1-3
days).
Similarly, we estimate that in the absence of syndromic air traveller screening, traveller
sensitisation can only delay the outbreak by 1 day (50%:<1-4 days) early in the epidemic when
the arrival rate is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction of the intervention. When
the rate of arrival at time of introducing only sensitisation is 10 infected travellers per week, the
introduction of sensitisation results in delays of less than 1 day (50%: <1-1 day) and that at 100
infected arrivals per week there is no delay unless the outbreak is completely averted (only the
case for 13% of simulated outbreaks).
For sensitivity analyses, we varied the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation and the
heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. A 50% reduction in the effective
reproduction number through traveller sensitisation followed by rapid case isolation and contact
tracing can potentially prevent a local outbreak independent of the number of infected arrivals if
the basic reproduction number is smaller than 3.3 (i.e.,   ‡¨¥ 1   & 1). As traveller
sensitisation increases and therefore a greater proportion of simulated  values are less than 1,
the proportion of simulated delays that are infinitely long (indicating that that specific simulated
potential outbreak has been averted) increases to nearly 66% (Table S1).
If the number of secondary infections is substantially less disperse, e.g. influenza-like, fewer
outbreaks are averted, and median outbreak delays decrease by about 25%, as the outbreak
becomes less reliant on occasional super-spreading events (Figure S4). If, however, the
number of secondary infections is slightly more disperse, i.e. the dispersion parameter estimate
of 0.1 (23), then outbreak delays are also approximately 25% shorter but fewer outbreaks are
averteed than in the  2 case (Table S1).

Discussion
Syndromic screening of air travellers at departure and/or arrival is unlikely to prevent a sufficient
nt
proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected travellers from entering a yet unaffected country and
thereby prevent a local outbreak. Similarly, sensitisation of travellers from high-risk countries to
encourage self-isolation and enable accelerated case detection and contact tracing if indeed
infected will likely not be able to halt an outbreak indefinitely, particularly when many infected

travellers arrive undetected, unless the effect of sensitisation is large enough ensure that the
number of secondary infections are, on average, less than 1 for the traveller and subsequent
cases. We investigate here how syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation, as well as their
combination, may delay an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
We find that when syndromic screening alone is introduced very early in the outbreak, i.e. at a
point when 0.1 infected travellers per week arrive, it can only slightly delay an outbreak (6 days,
50%: <1-13 days). Traveller sensitisation alone has a less pronounced effect by delaying the
outbreak by 1 day (50%: <1-7 days). The combination of syndromic screening and traveller
sensitisation may more substantially delay an outbreak while the number of infected travellers is
this low (12 days, 50%: 4-22). The incremental effect of syndromic entry screening is only
notable if exit screening is poor or even absent. These results are sensitive to a number of key
assumptions: with increasing R0, less heterogeneous R0 or less effective traveller sensitisation
the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible. Furthermore, once the weekly
number of infected passengers increases to 10 and above, e.g. as a result of an exponential
increase in cases at the origin of travel, even the combination of syndromic screening and
traveller sensitisation delays is unlikely to delay an outbreak for more than a week.
We find a potential small role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks
of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented very early in an
outbreak. We find that syndromic screening on arrival can add to the effect of traveller
sensitisation in these early stages of a pandemic. Syndromic screening can also aid to reduce
the number of passengers that would eventually self-report and then require resource-intensive
follow up, including contact tracing. As the rate of infected arrivals increases, contact tracing
becomes increasingly more difficult and the effectiveness is likely to decrease, further
shortening the achievable delays. Therefore, syndromic screening may have an additional role
in helping to sustain control efforts for longer. Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at
arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or
largely ineffective.
Delays in airport processes arising from screening may expose travellers to additional risk
depending on airport design and reduction in pedestrian flow rates within the terminal and
therefore the amount of time passengers spend waiting in crowded areas (24) as well as the
time spent boarding and alighting (25). While not as long in duration as the flight itself, during
their time in terminals, travellers mix with a much larger and more diverse range of people than
during the flight. This is outside the scope of this study, however, and relies on assumptions
about background prevalence in the community of airport users and mixing within airports.
While our findings may encourage implementation of both syndromic screening on entry and
traveller sensitisation in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it is important to note
that these findings are highly sensitive to the underlying base-case assumptions and do not
consider the economic implications of large scale air passenger screening and contact tracing
(26). Despite the cost, however, the argument could be made that public health (which enables

found that these restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation from mainland China to
other countries by 81% in the three weeks after introduction, and averted 71% of the cases that
they estimated would have occurred had no lockdown been introduced. This would provide
countries without established outbreaks to take measures to further delay, e.g. screening,
sensitisation and contact tracing, as well as preparing their health systems for the outbreak
(7,29).
With increasing numbers of infected travellers, a higher number of secondary infections or a
lower heterogeneity thereof, or less effective interventions, the achievable delay quickly drops
down to a few days of delay. While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARSCoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions. For
example, we have assumed recently reported heterogeneity in the individual R0, however, the
reported range of uncertainty includes SARS-like and influenza-like which can drastically alter
the results. Some recent estimates would suggest more SARS-like or even more overdispersed
k which would imply that longer outbreak delays are possible as shown in our sensitivity
analysis (30). We also don‚Äôt explicitly account for potential asymptomatic transmission.
However, we implicitly do so as both the syndromic screening as well as the contact tracing
work that informed our estimates accounted for a small proportion of asymptomatic transmitters
who we assume similarly transmit but will not be affected by syndromic screening or
sensitisation. Furthermore, the results are predicated on a syndromic screening sensitivity of
86% (6). When reducing the sensitivity to 70%, as used in other reports (5), delays reduce by
about 20%.
Travel restrictions were implemented in the form of flights exiting China being suspended (31),
which has potentially curbed the exponential increase of infected travellers despite an
exponential increase of infections in China. Assuming exponential growth with   0.1numbers
of infected arrivals would have increased from 1 to 10 and 100 per week within about 23 and 46
days respectively (assuming exponential growth with   0.1) and estimated delays would
decrease accordingly. However, infected traveller arrivals likely still have increased
exponentially as a result of the largely undetected spread in Iran and Italy (32) early on in the
pandemic (increasing, respectively, from 28 and 76 cases as of 23 Feb. 2020 (33) to 593 and
1128 a week later on 1 Mar. 2020 (34)).
By February, many major airlines had suspended flights from mainland China with travel
restrictions from Iran, Italy and Korea being added more recently. In the three weeks leading up
to the 28th February the UK reported 10 imported cases, 4 of them in the final week (35). At that
early point a more optimistic scenario would have been that the control measures in place limit
the number of infected travellers and may sustainably do so for a considerable amount of time.

This constant rate of importation, which is more similar to e.g. SARS in 2003 would have led to
much larger possible delays in local outbreak through targeting of air travellers.
Future pandemic threats will bear similar questions. While our considerations are focussed
around SARS-CoV-2 prevention there are some generally applicable conclusions. The expected
delay of a local outbreak as a result of traveller targeted interventions will depend on the
pathogen specific epidemiology but potential pre- and asymptomatic transmission are a key
challenge to the success of such. Further, for pathogens with long incubation period, syndromic
screening is likely to miss many infected passengers and a high reproduction number increases
the chance that a single missed infected will trigger a local outbreak.
In summary, we find that the targeting of air-travellers with syndromic screening at exit or entry
and sensitisation for signs of symptoms following their arrival has likely delayed the local
spread of SARS-CoV-2, but only by a few days. This is because measures were largely put in
place at a time where already a few infected travellers a week were arriving and that infection
prevalence among travellers was likely increasing exponentially. We find that syndromic
screening at arrival may enhance control efforts, but only in the absence of syndromic screening
at departure.
