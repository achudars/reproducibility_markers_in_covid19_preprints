Abstract
Fluorescent spot test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was
performed in 5 boys and 14 girls who had confirmed COVID-19. Out of those, 4 (80%) boys
and 5 (36%) girls were found to be G6PD deficient.
Main Text
On March 12, 2020, the first case of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was diagnosed in
the Al-Ahsa area, Saudi Arabia [1]. Until the end of April 2020, all children of less than 14
years old with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the Maternity and Children hospital in
Al-Ahsa area. During this period, 29 children (8 boys and 21girls) were admitted. All these
cases were either asymptomatic or with a mild COVID-19. Fluorescent spot test (FST) for
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency was performed in 5 boys and 14
girls. Out of those, 4 (80%) boys and 5 (36%) girls were found to be G6PD deficient. Our
FST has a cut-off point of 2.1 Units/gram Hemoglobin, which indicates these cases are
moderate to severe G6PD deficiency. All these cases were either asymptomatic or with a

mild COVID-19. The G6PD deficiency is overrepresented in this small case series as the
prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Al-Ahsa is 23% in males and 13% in females [2]. We and
others anticipate that G6PD deficient individuals will be more vulnerable to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic [3, 4].
Still, this needs to be confirmed in a large-scale population-based study.
