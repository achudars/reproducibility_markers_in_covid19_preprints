Abstract
There is a dire need for personal protective equipment (PPE) within healthcare settings during the
COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, single use disposable N95 face masks have been limited in
supply. We have developed an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable, Conformable (iMASC)
system for aerosol-based protection. The iMASC system was designed as a reusable liquid
silicone rubber mask with disposable N95 filter cartridges that can fit most face sizes and shapes.
This system reduced the amount of N95 filter while preserving breathability and fit. Using finite
element analysis, we demonstrated mask deformation and reaction forces from facial scans of
twenty different wearers. In addition, we validated these findings by successful fit testing in
twenty participants in a prospective clinical trial. The iMASC system has the potential to protect
our healthcare workers with a reusable N95-comparable face mask that is rapidly scalable.

Introduction
Dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals is forcing
healthcare workers to reuse and clean PPE using anecdotal strategies, which may weaken the
effectiveness of PPE in protecting workers from acquisition of COVID-19 disease. In some
places, the complete lack of PPE has resulted in healthcare workers using PPE that may have
variable droplet protection (1). Shortages of PPE have significant impact among healthcare
workers who evaluate individuals with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 disease (1-2). First,
individuals using PPE acquired outside of the hospital may inadvertently be using PPE without
droplet protection resulting in inadequate protection. Second, workers without PPE will acquire
infections, including COVID-19, at greater rates than those with adequate PPE (3). Infected
healthcare workers may transmit disease to family members, worsening the pandemic (4). Third,
with increased COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers, the available workforce to
address sick patients decreases, resulting in increasing morbidity and mortality (4). There is
therefore a critical need to develop innovative measures to generate safe, reusable PPE.
Thus, we have designed and fabricated an Injection Molded Autoclavable, Scalable,
Conformable (iMASC) system for aerosol-based protection with N95 material filters that can be
inserted and replaced as needed. To understand the ability of our mask to conform to multiple
face sizes and shapes, we have undertaken finite element analysis evaluating the deformability of
the iMASC system. Lastly, we performed a prospective clinical trial for fit testing of our mask as
well as qualitative assessment of the mask compared to the current N95 masks. Our goal is to
address the critical shortage of N95 face masks to maximally protect healthcare workers and
provide an enduring supply chain of N95 face masks to reduce and prevent COVID-19
transmission among healthcare workers and patients.
Results
Design and generation of injection molded liquid silicone rubber mask
The iMASC system was designed to function as an N95-comparable mask (Fig. 1). The
shape of the iMASC system was modeled from disposable regular N95 masks used in the
hospital, which are amenable to many different face sizes and shapes. Medical grade liquid
silicone rubber (LSR) was identified as an optimal material for mask fabrication due to its
conformable capacity, sterilizability through multiple methods and compatibility with injection
molding for fabrication scalability. The weight of the iMASC system was 44.84 ± 0.05 grams (n =
3) compared to 10.41 ± 0.13 grams (n = 3) of current N95 masks. We employed a dual filter
approach similar to half-mask elastomeric respirators to increase breathability and filtration area
(5). A single regular N95 mask generated up to 5 filters for the iMASC system, thus extending the
N95 material use. Furthermore, based upon the material selection of a medical grade LSR, the
iMASC system is reusable after sterilization by cleaning with hospital grade bleach/alcohol
wipes, autoclave and heating methods.

Characterization of mask material after sterilization
An advantage of the iMASC system over the half-mask respirators is the methods of
sterilization (see table S1). We have performed tensile tests of the mask material after 10
autoclave cycles and 5 minutes in a 1:10 bleach solution and 70% isopropyl alcohol. We found

that 10 autoclave cycles make the mask slightly stiffer, while the bleach soak resulted in no
change and the isopropanol alcohol soak makes the material less stiff (fig. S1). Despite these
small changes in tensile strength, there were no gross differences in the mask compared to the
non-sterilized mask.

Finite element analysis for mask deformation upon different face shapes and sizes
We used non linear finite element (FE) analyses (see “Deformation studies” in Methods)
to evaluate the deformation response of the flexible mask frames while wearing and determine the
forces required to keep the mask in place across a range of subject faces. In Fig. 2A, we reported
the numerical snapshots of the face mask when subjected to the strap’s tensile loads, denoted by ܶ
shown in fig. S3, and monitored the deformation of the mask at different levels of the reaction
force exerted from the mask to the face, ‫ ܨ‬ൌ 0 (undeformed), 4.5 (initial contact), and 10 (full
contact) N. The color maps represent the distribution of displacement’s magnitude, ܷ, showing
relatively large deformation of the mask required to fit in to the subject face. We also calculated
the normal contact forces, ‫ ܨ‬ே , and contact pressures, ܲ, as a function of ‫ ܨ‬to evaluate the
interaction between the mask and face. In Fig. 2B, the distribution of the ‫ ܨ‬ே are shown at the
different ‫ܨ‬. As expected, no ‫ ܨ‬ே was recorded at ‫ ܨ‬ൌ 0. By pulling the straps, the mask starts to be
engaged with the face, and at ‫ ܨ‬ൌ 4.5 N the maximum ‫ ܨ‬ே occurs around the cheek. Further
pulling the straps (‫ ܨ‬ൌ 10 N) induces a relatively higher ‫ ܨ‬ே along the edge of the mask in the
check and chin (lower lips) rather than the nose and cheekbones. This is a signature of the need to
the Aluminum strip to bond across the bridge of the nose to enhance the contact pressure.
Next, we estimated the reaction force required to achieve an average contact pressure of
ܲ ൌ10 KPa (relatively uniformly distributed along the edge of the mask) as a higher limit of the
contact pressure that results in a suitable fit between the mask and skin faces (6). This reaction
force is equivalent to the force applied through the straps. In Fig. 2C, we reported the reaction
forces for twenty different subjects, ranging from 9.5 to 15 N. These variations are duo to the
difference in shape and size of the subject’s faces especially in the jaw and cheekbone parts.
Through application of these forces via the straps combined with the aluminum strip across the
nose bridge, one can guarantee the mask will be tightly stayed in place.

Clinical trial evaluating mask fitting
In a prospective trial, we enrolled 24 healthcare workers at a large, urban, academic
medical center who had been previously certified to wear a N95 respirator into our IRB-approved
study. We excluded individuals with significant facial hair or those that had failed a N95 fit test.
Consenting individuals were subject to a fit test as defined by the United States Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (7-8). Briefly, participants first placed the iMASC
system on their face and molded the nosepiece to ensure an adequate seal. Next, the participant’s
head and face were placed in a plastic hood, and a saccharine solution was sprayed into the
enclosed space as guided by OSHA (7). Participants were asked to perform four maneuvers: 1)
rotating head in the lateral plane, 2) moving the head up and down, 3) verbally counting down
backwards from 100 to 90 and 4) bending at the waist. A passing test was defined as no detection
of saccharine solution by study participants. Fig. 3A shows the demographics of the participants,
and figs. S2 and S3 showcase the 3D facial reconstructions demonstrating variability of facial
sizes and shapes among the participants. The average age of participants was 41 years with a

range of 21-65 years with an average BMI of 26.5. The breakdown of participants by profession
was 46% nurses (n=11), 21% attending physicians (n=5), 21% resident physicians (n=5), and
12% technicians (n=3). Of these participants, 4 did not perform the fit testing (1 due to inability to
detect saccharin solution on pre-mask placement sensitivity test, 2 due to time, and 1 due to fit of
the mask on her face).
All participants (n=20) that performed the fit test successfully completed the fit test as part
of the hospital annual policy. All participants passed their fit test and were also able to
successfully replace the filter into the mask, resulting in a 100% success rate for both fit testing
and filter exchange. User experience with the iMASC system was evaluated using a Likert scale
with a score of 1 indicating excellent and a score of 5 indicating very poor. Of the 20 participants,
the average fit score of the mask was a 1.75 (Fig. 3B). Participants on average scored the
breathability of the mask as a 1.6 with a median of 1.5. Finally, ease of replacing the filter on the
mask was scored on average as a 2.05 with a median score of 2. Participants’ preference to wear
the iMASC over a surgical mask or an N95 respirator was also assessed. Sixty percent of
participants indicated they would be willing to wear our mask instead of a surgical mask, with
20% indicating no preference between our mask and a standard surgical mask and 20% indicating
they would prefer to wear a surgical mask (Fig. 3C). When asked about preference to wear our
mask instead of an N95 respirator, 25% of participants indicated they would prefer to wear our
mask and 60% indicated no preference between our mask and a standard issue mask, with only
15% indicating they would prefer to wear a standard issue N95 respirator (Fig. 3D).

Discussion
During times of pandemics, it is essential to protect healthcare workers from infection and
transmission of disease with adequate PPE (4,9). As stocks of N95 face masks have reduced,
healthcare workers are forced to find alternative strategies of protection, including re-sterilizing
masks and using alternative mask materials that may result in less protection and higher disease
transmission (9-10). Our approach here was to develop a scalable, reusable face mask that can
extend the amount of N95 material while providing the same droplet protection as standard N95
masks. The iMASC system was shown to successfully fit multiple different face sizes and shapes
using an OSHA approved testing method. Based on the success of the iMASC system in fit
testing, this approach could be scaled up for use across many locations. By selecting injection
molding as the fabrication technique for the iMASC system, we believe we possess a fundamental
advantage to other initiatives using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques because injection
molding is highly scalable and has decreased production time when compared to 3D printing.
These are initial proof-of-concept studies and have some limitations. First, filter
replacement was noted to be slightly challenging and additional design changes, such as slight
adjustments to dimensions and tolerances, would likely improve the fit and robustness. Additional
investigation into user sizing of head straps will be investigated, so as to accommodate more
potential users. All post injection-molding manufacturing steps were completed in-house and in
large scale production would be outsourced to contracted manufacturers with greater quality
control of filter components.
Newer face masks, such as our iMASC system, have potential to resupply hospitals and
clinicals with effective N95-comparable masks. Furthermore, a 2018 consensus report from the
National Academies of Engineering, Science, and Medicine recommended that the durability and

reusability of elastomeric respirators made them desirable for stockpiling for emergencies (5).
This approach could be applicable to users outside of the healthcare setting, including people in
the research, home improvement, and manufacturing settings.
Materials and Methods
iMASC fabrication
Masks were designed in SolidWorks based upon current 3M 1860 N95 masks. Once
optimized, the design was exported as a SolidWorks file. Reusable face masks were then
generated by Protolabs through injection molding out of liquid silicone rubber. Elastic straps were
used to secure the mask to the wearer’s face. The mask utilized dual, replaceable filters consisting
of virgin N95 filter media bonded to a rigid retaining ring which can easily press-fit into recessed
areas of the mask. A 3-inch long, 5mm wide aluminum strip was bonded across the bridge of the
nose section of the mask similar to traditional N95 masks.

Material selection and testing
As a material currently used in anesthesia masks, DOW QP1-250 LSR was selected as a
proven injection molding material which enabled greater design freedom for the manufacturing
process. Mechanical testing according to ASTM D412 was performed on samples cut directly
from masks exposed to a variety of sterilization methods including 10 cycles of autoclaving, 10minute soak in 10% bleach solution, and 10-minute soak in isopropanol.

Face scans
To obtain the 3D face geometry of the participants, we developed an IOS application (app)
using the TrueDepth camera from an iPhone 11 to capture the face image of the participants. The
app employs the ARKit developed by Apple for the use of face tracking in augmented reality to
transform a 2D image with depth information into a 3D mesh. The output 3D mesh would then be
converted into a solid model for finite element analysis.

Deformation studies
The commercial FE package ABAQUS/standard 2017 was used for simulating the
deformation response of elastic masks. The 3D FE models were constructed by importing the
CAD model of the mask from SolidWorks and scanned images of the participant faces. In all the
analyses, we discretized the mask using four-node 3D linear tetrahedron elements with hybrid
formulation (C3D4H Abaqus element type). The material behavior of the elastomeric mask was
captured using an almost incompressible Neo-Hookean hyperelastic model with Poisson’s ratio of
ν_0 = 0.499 and density of 1.12E3 kg/m3) with directly imported uniaxial test data described in
“Material characterization of the medical-grade silicone elastomer ”. The scanned faces were
imported as 3D Shell Discrete Rigid Element and meshed using three-node 3D rigid triangular
elements (R3D3 Abaqus element type). A simplified contact law (“surface to surface” type
interaction) was assigned to the model with a penalty friction coefficient 0.2 for tangential
behavior and a “hard” contact for normal behavior. The top-middle edge of the mask was
positioned to the node at the center of the line connecting the eyes. The “Quasi-static” dynamic
implicit solver (*DYNAMIC module in Abaqus) was used. The mask was deformed by applying
tensile forces along bands, shown in fig S3 using SMOOTH step amplitude curve, while

Clinical studies
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained prior to any work (Partners IRB
2020P000852). Subjects were comprised of adult Partners Healthcare staff including physicians,
residents, nurses, and technicians who were recruited on a voluntary basis. Subjects were enrolled
by study staff. Following enrollment and consent, subjects were briefed on the study procedure
and then completed a baseline assessment to obtain general demographic information and ensure
they had previously been fit tested successfully. Next, two sets of facial measurements were
taken: from the tip of the subject’s nose to the base of their chin and across the width of their
cheekbones. Each subject’s face was also scanned by a 3D scanner to generate a digital file.
Subjects underwent fit testing in accordance with the protocol outline in the OSHA
guidance in Appendix A of 1910.134 using the Gerson Respirator Fit Test kit (part # 065000). In
brief, a demonstration was performed to show subjects how to put on a respirator, how it should
be positioned on the face, how to set the strap tension and how to determine a proper fit. Subjects
then selected a respirator from the two available sizes and adjusted the facepiece until it provided
an acceptable fit and was comfortable. Fit was defined as proper placement of the chin; adequate
strap tension; fit across the bridge of the nose; tendency of respirator to slip; and ensuring the
respirator was of proper size to span between the bridge of the nose and the chin through selfobservation in a mirror. Comfort was defined as the position of the mask on the nose, face, and
cheeks; room for eye protection; and room to talk. Once the mask was deemed comfortable and of
adequate fit, the subject performed a user seal check. To check positive pressure, subjects gently
exhaled while wearing the mask to see if the facepiece bulged slightly. Similarly, to perform a
negative pressure air check subjects took a deep breath in while wearing the mask and observed
for areas of collapse. If air leaked between the subject’s face and the face seal of the respirator or
if bulging or collapse occurred during the user seal test, the subject removed the mask and began
the procedure again with a new mask. If the subject passed, they proceeded to the fit test.
Subjects first ensured they could detect the taste of the Saccharine test solution. Without a
mask on, subjects donned a hood with a fitted collar with a nozzle hole in front of the subject’s
mouth and nose. The subject was instructed to breathe through his or her nose and to report when
a bitter taste was detected. An inhalation medication nebulizer containing the test solution was
gently squeezed ten times while attached to the hood apparatus to aerosolize the test solution into
the hood for an approximate volume of 1ml of aerosolized test solution in the hood. If the subject
reported a bitter taste, the threshold test was considered complete. If the subject was unable to
taste anything, ten more squeezes were administered. Again, if the subject reported a bitter taste
the threshold test was considered complete and if not, another ten squeezes were administered (30
total). If the subject was unable to taste the test solution after 30 squeezes, the subject was
considered unable to taste the solution and was excused from the study. Study staff recorded the
taste threshold indicated in the threshold test for each subject.
After successful completion of the threshold screening test, subjects donned the mask they
had previously fitted for comfort and fit under a hood with a fitted collar and were instructed to
report if they could taste the test solution. A nebulizer of odorous solution (Saccharin) was
inserted into the hole in the front of the hood and sprayed at the same concentration (10, 20, or 30

squeezes) as the subject was able to taste in their initial threshold test. The subject was instructed
to perform the following exercises while the aerosolized solution was replenished every 30
seconds: normal breathing, deep breathing, turning the head side to side, moving the head up and
down, counting backwards from 100, grimacing, bending over, and finally normal breathing for a
second time. If the subject at any time during the fit test was able to taste the solution, they
indicated to the study staff and the test was considered failed. If the subject did not report tasting
the solution the test was considered passed.
Subjects who passed the fit test were introduced to how to properly replace the filter with
a demonstration by study staff. Subjects were then asked to replace the filter and perform a user
seal check to ensure an adequate fit. Subjects then performed a second fit test with the
replacement filter. Finally, subjects completed an exit assessment where they ranked fit,
breathability, and difficulty of replacing the filter according to a Likert scale. Subjects were also
asked about their willingness to wear the mask compared to either a surgical mask and an N95
mask. All testing was performed at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
