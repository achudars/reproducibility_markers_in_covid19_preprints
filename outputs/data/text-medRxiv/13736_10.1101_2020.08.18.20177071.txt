SUMMARY

28

Background: COVID-19 has stretched the ability of many institutions to supply needed

29

personal protective equipment, especially N95 respirators. N95 decontamination and reuse

30

programs provide one potential solution to this problem. Unfortunately, a comprehensive

31

evaluation of the effects of decontamination on the integrity of various N95 models using a

32

quantitative fit test (QTFT) approach is lacking. Aims: 1) To investigate the effects of up to eight

33

rounds of vaporized H2O2 (VHP) decontamination on the integrity of N95 respirators currently in

34

use in a hospital setting. 2) To examine if N95 respirators worn by one user can adapt to the

35

face shape of a second user with no compromise of integrity following VHP decontamination.

36

Methods: The PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit Tester Model 8038 was used to quantitatively

37

define the integrity, measured by fit, of N95 respirators following decontamination with VHP.

38

Findings: There was an observable downward trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield

39

46727 N95 respirators throughout eight cycles of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of 3M

40

1870 N95 respirators was significantly reduced after the respirator was worn, decontaminated

41

with VHP, and then quantitatively fit tested on a second user. Furthermore, we uncovered

42

inconsistencies between qualitative fit test and QTFT results that may have strong implications

43

on the fit testing method used by institutions. Conclusions: Our data revealed variability in the

44

integrity of different N95 models after VHP decontamination and exposed potential limitations of

45

N95 decontamination and reuse programs.

INTRODUCTION
As of August 2020, over 21.7 million people have been infected and more than 770,000

54

have died from COVID-19 worldwide [1]. Healthcare workers are at high risk of contracting

55

COVID-19 [2-4], making personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 respirators, critical

56

for their protection. Many hospitals have universally implemented the use of N95 respirators

57

during routine care to limit exposure to mild and asymptomatic individuals and during aerosol-

58

producing procedures, such as intubation and mechanical ventilation [5,6]. This increase in use

59

has left many hospitals struggling to maintain adequate stock of N95 respirators in the face of

60

increasing supply chain shortages [7-10].

61

Decontamination and reuse of N95 respirators is a potential solution for alleviating

62

respirator scarcity during the COVID-19 pandemic as per the Occupational Safety and Health

63

Administration’s (OSHA) recently updated guidelines [11]. Previous studies have validated the

64

use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) [12], moist heat [13], dry heat [14], or ultraviolet

65

germicidal radiation [15] for decontamination of N95 respirators. The integrity of decontaminated

66

N95 respirators, measured by fit, must be maintained following processing. Proper fit is defined

67

as an intact, airtight seal against the user’s face that can be measured using either a qualitative

68

fit test (QLFT) or a quantitative fit test (QTFT), as defined by Appendix A of the OSHA Standard

69

1920.134 [16]. A QTFT more accurately identifies proper fit than a QLFT [17,18]. However, an

70

N95 respirator that is tested using a QTFT cannot be subsequently worn for future protection

71

because this procedure requires puncturing a hole into the respirator to assess fit. On the other

72

hand, N95 respirators examined via a QLFT can be kept and used by the wearer after the test is

73

completed.

74

Current decontamination studies only use a manikin head form to quantitatively assess fit

75

factor and fail to evaluate all respirator models used in hospital settings [19,20]. However, product

76

scarcity has required the use of many different N95 models, most of which have not been

77

evaluated after decontamination. Additionally, it can be challenging to develop and maintain

78

systems which ensure that respirators are returned to their original user, as opposed to returning

79

the same model but from a different user post-decontamination. Yet, the integrity of N95

80

respirators worn by multiple persons has not been investigated.

81

Here, we first evaluated the number and type of N95 respirators qualitatively fit tested

82

and distributed by University Hospital (UH) in Newark, NJ before and during the COVID-19

83

pandemic. We then used QTFTs to assess the integrity of 4/7 of these N95 models following

84

sequential rounds of decontamination with VHP. The integrity of decontaminated N95

85

respirators was then tested on a second user using a QTFT approach. Finally, we evaluated the

86

reliability of qualitative fit testing on models that we found were hard to fit quantitatively by

87

comparing QLFT vs. QTFT results. Our findings revealed that the majority of N95 respirators

88

evaluated were able to withstand the VHP decontamination process and that these N95

89

respirators could be returned to new users with no significant decrease in integrity. However, we

90

did observe exceptions to these findings that may have strong implications on which respirator

91

models are suitable for decontamination and reuse programs. Furthermore, differences in QLFT

92

and QTFT results for certain respirator models uncovered potential weaknesses in using QLFTs

93

for measuring the protective ability of N95 respirators.

94

METHODS

95

Human subjects approval. Experiments involving fit testing and decontamination of N95

96

respirators was part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic and were thus

97

considered exempt from institutional review board approval. All participants gave informed

98

consent prior to participating in any experiments.

99

N95 Decontamination. Respirators were decontaminated using VHP which was delivered via

100

the Steris VHP system (Steris Life Sciences, Mentor, OH). Respirator hanging and

101

decontamination was similar to previously published studies [12].

102

Fit Testing. Fit testing was administered following OSHA standard Appendix A to 1920.134 with

103

minor modifications: 1) N95 respirators tested using both QLFTs and QTFTs underwent QLFTs

104

first, 2) QLFT users were blinded to the order by which qualitative testing was administered

105

(sweet followed by bitter). All users were deemed medically able to complete fit testing

106

beforehand.

107

Qualitative fit testing: The 3M Qualitative Fit Test Apparatus FT-30, Bitter (denatonium

108

benzoate) 1 kit and 3M Qualitative Fit Test Apparatus FT-10, Sweet (saccharine) kit (3M, Saint

109

Paul, MN) were used for QLFTs. These kits included a hood, collar, and nebulizers which were

110

used to aerosolize the tasting solution. All users were sensitive to tasting agents.

111

Quantitative fit testing: The QTFTs were administered using a PortaCount Pro+ Respirator Fit

112

Tester Model 8038 with an N95-Companion™ Fit N95 Tester Model 8026 Particle Generator

113

(TSI, Shoreview, MN). Respirators were punctured with custom grommet sampling probes to

114

connect a sampling tube between the inside of an N95 respirator and the PortaCount Pro+

115

machine. Sodium chloride tablets were used for particle generation. All testing was conducted

116

above the minimum recommendations of 70 ambient particles/cc and a passing test required a

117

fit factor of >100. Fit factors were calculated by the apparatus from the ratio of particles outside

118

to particles inside the respirator.

119

Second user N95 respirators. Respirators that had previously failed a QLFT were termed

120

“lightly used” because even though the nosepiece had been fit and shaped to a user’s face, the

121

respirator did not undergo the extended wear that is representative of a long hospital shift.

122

These lightly used N95 respirators were used for second user experiments.

123

Respirator sizing. All respirators used except Kimberly Clark/Halyard Fluidshield (Halyard

124

Fluidshield) and 3M 1860 were available in one size only. Halyard Fluidshield N95 respirators

125

were available in small (46827) and regular (46727) sizes. 3M 1860 N95 respirators were also

126

available in small (1860S) and regular (1860) sizes. For these models, the appropriate size was

127

determined for each participant using a QTFT before the start of the study. The correct size was

128

then used for each subject in all experiments.

129

130

To analyze the effect of decontamination on N95 integrity we used a one tailed Kruskal-Wallis

131

test. A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the differences between N95

132

respirators worn by one user and N95 respirators worn by a second user following

133

decontamination. All statistical analysis was run using Prism 8 software.

134

RESULTS

135

Respirator models and fit testing have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in a

136

hospital setting. To define the scope of our targeted decontamination study, we examined the

137

use of N95 respirators at UH before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of

138

QLFTs in 2020 from January to May was about tenfold greater than the average monthly

139

frequency from 2014 to 2019 (Figure 1A). Over 99% of fit testing conducted before 2020 was on

140

one of four N95 models, Halyard Fluidshield 46727/46827 (59.59%), 3M 1860/3M1860S

141

(25.75%), 3M 1870 (8.68%), and Cardinal Health (5.79%) (Figure 1B). In addition to these

142

models, Gerson 2130 (15.4%), Gerson 1730 (5.38%), and 3M 9210 (4.93%) were introduced

143

during January to May 2020 (Figure 1B). However, Halyard Fluidshield 46727/46827 (21.97%),

144

3M 1860/3M 1860S (17.64%), 3M 1870 (13%), and Cardinal Health (21.23%) still comprised the

145

majority of the respirators distributed (Figure 1B). Overall, we observed an increase in the

146

diversity, fit test frequency, and use of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic.

147

Variation in quantitative fit testing across different N95 models. Prior to any VHP

148

decontamination, we conducted QTFTs on the seven N95 models used at UH during the

149

COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 2). We defined a QTFT fit factor of >100 to be a passing value.

150

Users who passed a QTFT were considered certified to use the N95 model tested. Respirator

151

models with high frequency of passing across different users were 3M 1860/3M 1860S, 3M

152

1870, 3M 9210, and Halyard Fluidshield 46727, which had passing rates of 71%, 100%, 75%,

153

and 80%, respectively. The other models tested had much lower QTFT passing rates across

154

different users with Cardinal Health, Gerson 1730, and Gerson 2130 having passing rates of

155

0%, 10%, and 11%, respectively. These models may work well with face types and sizes not

156

representative in our volunteer population. However, for our studies we defined these last three

157

models as “hard-to-fit” and did not include them in the decontamination experiments.

158

Decontamination with VHP does not affect the integrity of 3M 1860/3M 1860S, 3M 1870,

159

3M 9210, but may reduce the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727. To evaluate the effect

160

of VHP decontamination on N95 respirator integrity, new unworn N95 respirators were

161

decontaminated consecutively for up to eight cycles. Following each decontamination cycle, a

162

subset was removed for quantitative fit testing. Availability and supply limitations of N95

163

respirators influenced which models were evaluated at each decontamination cycle and only

164

cycles with at least n= 3 were analyzed. Both 3M 1860/3M 1860S and 3M 1870 N95 respirators

165

maintained integrity following up to eight and six cycles of VHP decontamination, respectively

166

(Figure 3A and 3B). There was also no significant difference in the integrity of 3M 9210 following

167

up to seven decontamination cycles (Figure 3C). We observed a clear downward trend in the

168

integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators throughout eight decontamination cycles

169

(Figure 3D). However, due to the limited number of respirators during this critical time we were

170

unable to detect any significant differences in the data. Importantly, we did not notice any

171

defects in the elastic headbands, nor did we observe any corrosion on the metal nosepiece and

172

staples following eight cycles with VHP which has also been validated by others [19]. Our

173

observations suggest that some but not all N95 models are appropriate to include in respirator

174

decontamination and reuse programs and warrant further study.

175

Decreased integrity of 3M 1870 N95 respirators is observed when the respirator is lightly

176

worn and then fit tested by a second user. Not all N95 models will be compatible with all face

177

types and sizes. Respirators that fail QLFTs are generally discarded, but that does not mean

178

they will not provide protection to a different user; it means that the respirator and face type are

179

incompatible. Instead of letting these respirators go to waste, we decontaminated them with

180

VHP and then investigated the flexibility of their face-sealing capacity by assessing integrity on

181

a second user. These second users had previously passed a QTFT on the model (and size

182

where appropriate) being tested. There was a significant decrease in the integrity of 3M 1870

183

N95 respirators when the respirator was lightly worn, decontaminated for six cycles with VHP,

184

and fit tested by a second user compared to a respirator of the same model and size that had

185

undergone the same number of decontamination cycles but was never previously used (Figure

186

4B). No significant differences were observed in the integrity of 3M 1860/3M 1860S, 3M 9210,

187

and Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators when fit tested by a second user following

188

multiple rounds of decontamination (Figure 4 A, C, D). Again, due to the limited supply of N95

189

respirators we were unable to assess the differences in integrity between first user and second

190

user for all cycles and models (Figure S1 A-D).

191

Discrepancies between qualitative and quantitative fit testing are apparent when

192

evaluating Gerson 1730. We expanded our study to examine the possibility of inconsistencies

193

between QLFT and QTFT results from hard-to-fit N95 models. Using both sweet and bitter

194

QLFT measurements followed by a QTFT, we determined that 5/6 participants who passed at

195

least one qualitative fit test were unable to pass quantitatively when testing the Gerson 1730

196

N95 respirator (Table I). Unfortunately, we were unable to find enough participants able to

197

qualitatively fit either Gerson 2130 or Cardinal Health N95 respirators and therefore they were

198

not included in this study (Table SI). The inconsistency between qualitative and quantitative fit

199

testing results calls to question the reliability of QLFTs for measuring the capacity of N95

200

respirators to protect against aerosol exposure.

201

DISCUSSION

202

COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic on 11th March 2020 and has since resulted

203

in an overburdened healthcare system that is struggling to maintain adequate PPE, especially

204

N95 respirators. Many clinical settings have implemented decontamination and reuse programs

205

in response to these shortages. However, recent evaluations of N95 integrity following

206

decontamination have only assessed a single N95 model, 3M 1860/3M 1860S [12-15], and

207

therefore do not account for the total variety of N95 respirators currently in use. This lack of

208

validation means health care workers could be at an increased risk of receiving inadequate

209

PPE. Thus, in this study we quantitatively evaluated the integrity of multiple N95 models

210

currently in use at UH following decontamination with VHP.

211

From January to May 2020, UH increased qualitative fit testing over tenfold and

212

expanded the models of N95 respirators distributed compared to six years prior. Using unworn

213

N95 respirators, we examined the integrity of these models after decontamination with VHP and

214

found that 3M 1860/3M 1860S, 3M 1870, and 3M 9210 did not exhibit any noticeable decrease

215

of integrity. Although not significant, we did observe a downward trend in the integrity of Halyard

216

Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators over the course of five decontamination cycles, highlighting

217

the importance of further studies.

218

It is crucial that decontamination and reuse programs are able to rapidly turnaround

219

clean N95 respirators. One potential time saving approach is to return N95 respirators to new

220

users instead of having to sort and return respirators to their initial user. To assess the

221

adaptability of N95 respirators to a new face we quantitatively fit tested lightly worn respirators

222

on a second user following decontamination with VHP. Our results were limited to respirators

223

that were initially only worn for a QLFT and are thus not representative of the wear and tear

224

associated during an extended hospital shift. Despite these limitations, the QTFT values were

225

lower for 3M 1870 N95 respirators when they were lightly worn and fit tested by a second user

226

compared to the other respirator models tested. It is also possible that some respirators may be

227

less tolerant for reuse even by the same person, however we were unable to assess that in this

228

study. Although, others have found a significant association between number of shifts N95

229

respirators were worn by a single user and failed QLFTs [21]. These data bring to light a

230

significant obstacle for decontamination and reuse programs.

231

A major unexpected result in this study was the inability to find many users who passed

232

QTFTs on Gerson 1730, Gerson 2130, and Cardinal Health N95 models, despite these

233

respirators representing 42% of passing QLFTs at UH. We therefore wondered if differences

234

existed between QTFT and QLFT results specifically on these hard-to-fit models. Of the ten

235

participants we recruited for QLFTs, six were able to pass at least one of the tasting challenges

236

when qualitatively fit tested on Gerson 1730. Interestingly, only 1/6 of these participants was

237

able to pass on the Gerson 1730 using a QTFT. This discrepancy between QLFTs and QTFTs

238

may be attributed to taste insensitivity which has been shown to increase false positive fit

239

testing [18,22] and could also be a symptom of COVID-19 infection [23-25]. Furthermore,

240

anecdotal reports have indicated issues with competing taste profiles such as previously eaten

241

foods or disinfectants used to clean the hood that may further complicate QLFT results.

242

Together these observations suggest the administration of QTFTs may be warranted for fit

243

testing these hard-to-fit models and should be used to assess inconsistencies between QLFT

244

on other N95 models.

245

We acknowledge that this study has several limitations. All fit testing methods can have

246

false pass rates of up to 11% [17]. The number of N95 respirators fit tested after each

247

decontamination cycle was restricted by supply availability and resulted in unequal sample sizes

248

between groups. Finally, when assessing the integrity of N95 respirators fit on a second user,

249

the original N95 respirator was not worn during a long shift and therefore may not be

250

representative of all respirators included in decontamination and reuse programs.

251

CONCLUSIONS

252

Decontamination and reuse of 3M 1860/3M 1860S, 3M 1870, and 3M 9210 N95 respirators is a

253

potential solution to N95 respirator supply shortages. Further studies must address the

254

downward trends observed in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 N95 respirators after

255

decontamination with VHP. Caution should be taken when returning 3M 1870 to a second user

256

following VHP decontamination. Finally, the lack of consistency between QLFT and QTFT

257

results may have far reaching consequences on the type of fit test administered by institutions

258

when determining which respirator is best for protection against aerosolized pathogens.

343

Figure 1: Fit test frequency and distribution of N95 respirators by UH. A) The frequency of

344

QLFTs increased tenfold and the B) diversity of N95 models expanded since the beginning of

345

the COVID-19 pandemic.

346

Figure 2: Quantitative fit testing of N95 respirators commonly used at UH between

347

January and May 2020. These data defined quantitatively hard-to-fit N95 models: Cardinal

348

Health, Gerson 1730, and Gerson 2130. A fit factor >100 was considered a pass (dotted line).

349

Bars represent the median. 3M 1860/3M 1806S n=7, 3M 1870 n=4, 3M 9210 n=4, Halyard

Fluidshield 46727 n=5, Cardinal Health n=10, Gerson 1730 n=10, Gerson 2130 n=9.

351

Figure 3: Decontamination with VHP does not affect the integrity of A) 3M 1860, B) 3M

352

1870, C) 3M 9210, but potentially reduces the integrity of D) Halyard Fluidshield 46727. No

353

significant differences were observed between decontamination cycles for any model when

354

analyzed using a one tailed Kruskal-Wallis test. However, there was an observable downward

355

trend in the integrity of Halyard Fluidshield 46727 throughout eight cycles of decontamination. A

356

passing value was set as a fit factor >100 (dotted line). Only decontamination cycles with at

357

least n= 3 were considered for analysis. Bars represent the median.

on new N95 respirators (closed circles) were used to evaluate the effect of light wear (open

361

circles) on N95 respirator integrity following VHP decontamination. A) A nonsignificant

362

downward trend in the integrity of 3M 1860/3M 1860S N95 respirators is observed following five,

363

six, and seven decontamination cycles when the N95 respirator was previously worn. B) 3M

364

1870s that were lightly worn, decontaminated for six cycles, and fit on a new second user had a

365

significant decrease in integrity compared to 3M 1870 N95 respirators that were

366

decontaminated for six cycles but not previously worn. No significant trends were found in the

367

integrity of C) 3M 9210 and D) Halyard Fluidshield 46727 when the N95 respirator was

368

previously worn. Only decontamination cycles with at least n= 3 were considered for analysis. A

369

passing value was set as a fit factor >100 (dotted line). Bars represent the median. A one tailed

370

Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis (*, p=0.025).
