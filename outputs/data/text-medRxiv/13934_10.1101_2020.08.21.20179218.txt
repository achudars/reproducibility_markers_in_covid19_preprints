Abstract
Background
Since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, attempts have been made to monitor trends over time and to compare
countries and regions. Insufficient testing for COVID-19 underestimates the incidence and inflates the case-fatality
proportion. Given the age- and sex- distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, the underlying sex- and
age-distribution of a population needs to be accounted for. The aim of this paper is to present a method for
monitoring trends of COVID-19 using adjusted mortality trend ratios (AMTR).

Methods

Age- and sex-mortality distribution of a reference population composed of the first 14,086 fatalities which
occurred before the end of March and were reported in Europe by some countries were used to calculate age- and
sex-specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These were applied to each country population to calculate
the expected deaths. Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratios (AMTRs) with 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) were calculated
for selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 by dividing observed cumulative mortality, by
expected mortality times the crude mortality of the reference population. These estimated the sex- and ageadjusted mortality for COVID-19 per million population in each country.

Results

The cumulative mortality from COVID-19, the crude mortality rates, and the AMTRs were calculated for each
country and compared. United Kingdom, Italy, France and Spain registered the highest mortality in Europe. On
22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000 inhabitants; and it was
highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants) followed by Spain, UK, Italy, Sweden and France. When
accounting for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, Belgium remained the single country
experiencing the highest AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants on 22/06/2020; however Ireland – which had a CMR
in line with the total European population – emerged as having experienced a much more important impact of
COVID-19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy.

Conclusions
In understanding and managing the pandemic of COVID-19, comparable international data is a priority. Our
methods allow a fair comparison of mortality in space and over time. The authors urge the WHO, given the
absence of age and sex-specific mortality data for direct standardisation, to adopt this method to estimate the
comparative mortality from COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.

Key message
•

Comparing trends of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and in space is essential to monitor the disease
and compare different local policies

•

Using the concept of indirect standardisation we propose a method to effectively compare age- and
sex-adjusted mortality rates trends interpretable as deaths for COVID-19 per million inhabitants

•

Applying this methods, interesting features of the infection in Europe emerged; e.g. by 22/06/2020
Belgium is the most severely affected country with an AMTR of 929 per million inhabitants, followed by
the UK; Ireland and Sweden rank fourth and fifth most affected country in Europe

•

The WHO should consider using this method for monitoring the spread of COVID-19, which only
requires recording the total number of death from COVID-19 from each country/region

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City (China) was identified as having been caused by
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, leading to the disease now termed COVID-19. The subsequent global transmission led to the
outbreak being classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 March 2020 . Some of
th

1

the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection (long incubation period, heterogeneity of symptoms, transmission
by asymptomatic carriers)

1–5

have contributed to make the estimates of its distribution at population level

somewhat challenging. Nonetheless, monitoring the pandemic including international comparisons is of
paramount importance to understand the infection dynamics, and to prepare healthcare systems. In addition, this
would allow estimating the efficacy of the measures adopted in some countries, but not in others.
When comparing data from different countries it is essential that the metric used relies on data collected in a
similar way assuring comparability . There are currently variable policies about testing for COVID-19 leading to
6

undercounts, especially of people showing few symptoms. In countries where there is no community testing
policy, only those individuals reaching the hospital are tested in order to protect the healthcare workers and the
other patients. This leads to selection bias where the most severe cases only are tested, underestimating incidence
and inflating case fatality ratios. Without comprehensive community testing the comparison of incidence or any
other metric using the number of “confirmed cases”

7,8

is inaccurate. Conversely, mortality should suffer from less

variability given that it is independent from testing policy, and that it should be recorded fairly consistently across
countries given the uniqueness of the clinical picture of the people severely affected by COVID-19.
Given the particular age- and sex- distribution of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 , the underlying sex- and
4,9

age-distribution of a population is of great importance in determining the number of expected cases. Therefore,
not adjusting for age undermines meaningful comparison between populations, especially when the age structures
differs markedly, such as when comparing lower- with higher-income countries. To date, due to the sudden onset
and speed of the pandemic, it has been difficult to compare data coming from different countries partly because
basic epidemiological principles (e.g. adjustment for age and sex) have not been applied consistently, the main
emphasis having been on the number of cases

Standardised Mortality Trend Ratios (SMTRs) were used to describe the COVID-19 related mortality trends over
time across Italian regions by some of us . The aim of this paper is to expand on that approach and to present a
11

method for monitoring trends of burden of COVID-19 based on the concept of indirect standardisation . The
12

method is illustrated by an application to recent data coming from European countries.

Methods
Some considerations on case definition of COVID-19 and related mortality are reported in Panel 1. The main
metrics used in epidemiology to monitor disease occurrence are summarised in Panel 2.

COVID-19 Case definition
The definition of a “case” affects the metrics that monitor trends of COVID-19; cases can be defined as anyone
who has been infected from COVID-19 – or “confirmed case” ; or anyone who is symptomatic. In the first case,
7,8

a form of biological test would be needed to detect the infected but asymptomatic cases . Given that some
7,8

preliminary studies of seroprevalence estimate that up to 90% of infected people are asymptomatic or go
completely undetected by the health system

13

the choice of the definition of case is likely to make a large

difference in any metric used. To date, however, detecting all those infected is complicated given that
development of serological tests with good sensitivity and specificity for wide-scale use is not finalised yet

.

1,14

Consequently, detection of viral RNA in symptomatic people has been the main strategy to define cases in the
majority of countries.
Even ascertaining COVID-19 mortality is not problem-free. When defining mortality, in some countries all deaths
arising from COVID-19 positive subjects are counted, regardless of the immediate cause of death (also defined

death with the infection). Conversely, in other countries mortality was defined as deaths occurring in those for
whom the immediate or underlying cause of death can be reasonably ascribed to COVID-19 (also defined

mortality from the infection). Clearly, the first approach would lead to higher COVID-19 mortality and it is
important that the mortality definition is kept as much as possible homogenous. The World Health Organisation
(WHO) published guidance advocating for the use of deaths from COVID-19 for surveillance purposes (“(…)
death resulting from a clinically compatible illness, in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a
clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma)” .

Definition of the main metrics used to monitor COVID-19 epidemic
• Incidence (cumulative) in the population: the number of new (symptomatic) cases of infection over a time
period divided by the population at risk at the beginning of the same time period. Incidence would be the best
way of measuring the number of new cases in a population over time, but it is heavily affected by case
reporting. Calculating the incidence of symptomatic cases requires a notification system by which all people
manifesting COVID-19 symptoms are recorded as new cases in a systematic way by the health authority. This
requires a strong and coordinated infrastructure, but is limited by varying case definitions (unless it is possible
to reliably test all those manifesting the symptoms). Trying to assess the incidence of the infection, on the
other hand, (i.e. counting the number of infected rather than symptomatic as the numerator), requires a
routine effective population testing and case tracing where all suspected contact with diagnosed case are
14

tested for COVID-19. Unless incidence is used to compare regions within a country with very strong and
similar monitoring approaches, it is unlikely it can be used more widely to compare a large number of
countries with different approaches and resources.

• Hospitalization (incidence of): number of cases admitted to hospital over a time period out of the total
population at risk at the beginning of the time period. Hospitalization in general can be used as a good proxy
for the incidence of severe disease. However, given the pressure that the pandemic has put on national
health systems, the policies of countries regarding hospitalization have varied greatly, potentially preventing
meaningful comparisons. Hospitalisation is also a function of health system structure and capacity, and local
policy for management of infected people.

• ICU hospitalization (incidence of): number of cases admitted to an intensive care unit. ICU hospitalization
incidence is also a good proxy of severe cases. The limitations mentioned above apply also in this case.

• Mortality (incidence of): the number of death from COVID-19 in a given time period over the population at
risk at the beginning of the same time period. This is a vital public health metric. Mortality from COVID-19
represents an admittedly imprecise proxy for incidence in the population by assuming the case fatality ratio is
constant in space and over time. Mortality reflects partially the pandemic dynamics, measuring a combination
of incidence and quality of the healthcare systems both in terms of capacity and of infrastructure and
organization. Mortality is related to the number of infected in a given country in a specific time and can be
measured in this context with three metrics:

• Total mortality rate: total number of deaths from COVID-19 over the whole population in a certain period
of time

• Case Fatality Rate (CFR): number of deaths from COVID-19 over the number of cases (infected and
symptomatic) in a certain period of time

16

• Infection Fatality Rate (IFR): number of deaths from COVID-19 over the number of cases (all infected,

regardless of being symptomatic) over a certain period of time . Measuring CFR and IFR suffers from the

same limitations discussed above for incidence.

P ANEL 2: D EFINITION OF THE MAIN METRICS USED TO MONITOR COVID-19

Data collection and statistical analysis
Daily total number of deaths from COVID-19 from selected European countries from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020
were extracted from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) website , these were
17

summed up to display cumulative number of deaths per day per country. Crude mortality rate per 1,000,000 was
calculated daily in each country by dividing the number of cumulative deaths by the total country population in
2018 extracted from the Organisation for the Economic co-operation and Development (OECD) .
18

A reference population and a reference period was conveniently defined as the population of the European
countries for which the age- and sex-distribution of deaths from COVID-19 by the end of March 2020 was available.
Age- and sex distribution of a total of 14,086 COVID-19-related fatalities which occurred during the reference
period (649 from the United Kingdom up to 27/03/2020 , 4,993 from Italy released on 23/03/2020 , 821 from

31/03/2020) were used to calculate age- and sex-specific mortality rates per 1,000,000 population. These rates
were applied to the entirety of European countries 2018 population in order to estimate the number of expected
cases in each country, which can be interpreted as the number each country would have had if they experienced
the rates of the reference population by the end of the reference period (end of march 2020) .
12

For each day, the number of cumulative observed deaths in each country was divided by the number of expected
deaths by end of the reference period, and multiplied by 100 to calculate the Standardised Mortality Trend Ratio
(SMTR) in the i-th day, as done previously , with the following formula:

95% confidence intervals of SMTR were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution. Subsequently, each SMTR was
multiplied by the crude death rate calculated in the reference period multiplied by 10,000 in order to obtain the
Adjusted Mortality Trend Ratio (AMTR) per million inhabitants in the i-th day, applying the following formula, as
described in :

The AMTR can be interpreted as the age- and sex-adjusted number of deaths per million inhabitants due to COVID19 if the population had experienced the same mortality rate as the reference population in the reference period.

Results
The daily number of deaths from COVID-19 reported in each country from 17/03/2020 to 22/06/2020 are plotted
in in Supplementary Figure 1. While in some countries such as Italy the curve was relatively smooth, in others such
as France and Belgium an alternate pattern is observable, probably reflecting some differential timing in reporting
of deaths across regions. On 04/04/2020, France reported the overall highest daily mortality, with 2004 deaths
from COVID-19 in one day.
Daily cumulative number of deaths was calculated in all European countries which were then ranked as in Table 1.
Cumulative deaths were also plotted against time in Figure 1. Italy was the first country registering more than
20,000 deaths in mid-April, and totalled 34,643 deaths by the end of the observation period (22/06/2020). A
similar pattern was observed in Spain and France, with only about a week’s delay, which however levelled off
reaching a total of 29,927 and 30,037 deaths by 22/06/2020, respectively. Conversely, in the UK, despite the
20,000 deaths threshold being reached about 10 days after Italy, the death toll increase was steady exceeding
other countries by 14/05/2020 and registering the highest toll in Europe of 40,585 by the end of the observation
period. Belgium, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden registered increasing number of deaths with similar trends,
but never reaching the 10,000 deaths threshold.

Crude mortality rates were plotted as shown in Figure 2; the resulting ranking of countries by the end of the study
period is in Table 1. On 22/06/2020 in Europe the total mortality rate from COVID-19 was 352 per 1,000,000
inhabitants; this was highest in Belgium (850 per 1,000,000 inhabitants on the same date) and lowest in Slovakia (5
deaths per 1,000,000 inhabitants). Once accounting for the total country population, in Belgium there was a sharp
increase in crude mortality around the second and third weeks of April, with the highest crude mortality on the
17/04/2020. Spain experienced higher mortality than Italy from the first week of April maintaining higher rates
afterwards and reaching a mortality rate of 635 per 1,000,000 inhabitants by 22/06/2020 compared to 573 per
1,000,000 in Italy on the same day. Crude mortality in France was below the Spanish rates, reaching an overall
crude mortality rate of 448 by 22/06/2020. The steep increase in mortality in the UK is reflected in the fact that it
reached a crude mortality rate of 611 per 1,000,000 inhabitants by the end of observation period. A similar steep
pattern in crude mortality rate increase was spotted in Sweden which overtook France by the end of observation
period with a crude mortality rate of 497 per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Interestingly, once accounting for the
population size, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Luxembourg experienced crude mortality rates aligned with the
European average.
AMTRs of each country are plotted in Figure 3, and countries were ranked accordingly in Table 1. When accounting
for the underlying age and sex structure of each country, the overall trends of the crude mortality ratios were
replicated with some notable differences. While Belgium remained the single country experiencing the highest
adjusted mortality rates (AMTR on 22/06/2020: 929 per million inhabitants), the United Kingdom was the second
ranking European country per age- and sex-adjusted COVID-19 mortality

with a AMTR of 698/million on

22/06/2020. Notably, Ireland which had a CMR in line with the total European population (Figure 2), once the
underlying sex- and age-structure of the population is accounted for showed a much more important impact of
COVID-19 mortality with an AMTR of 550/million on 22/06/2020, higher than Sweden and Italy.

Discussion
Most reports on COVID-19 epidemiological data to date have not taken the underlying population structures into
account, prompting the need for the development of a reliable method for monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic

over time and in space while accounting for age-structures of the populations. Using this method of calculating
AMTRs, starting from the age- and sex-distribution of mortality among a reference population during a reference
period allowed a comparison of trend both in space and over time discovering features of the pandemic otherwise
not easily detectable. For example, that United Kingdom experienced the second highest mortality in Europe by
the end of June, and that Ireland was the fourth ranking county just above Sweden.
In countries where the social distancing measures have not been taken (i.e. Sweden) or have been substantially
delayed (i.e. UK) the curve of AMTRs shows a much steeper shape compared to other European countries which
have enforced stricter rules.

Strengths and limitations
The main strength of this approach for monitoring COVID-19 pandemic is the minimal data requirement to be
modelled. By only obtaining periodic COVID-19 total mortality from countries or regions, AMTRs can be calculated
allowing a sound comparison of trends in space and over time while accounting for the underlying sex- and agestructure of the population. This allowed comparison between countries with different demographic structures for
COVID-19 mortality and other diseases whose mortality is so strongly associated with age.
The main potential limitations of this approach refers to the definition of mortality for COVID-19. Discrepancies in
defining deaths from COVID-19 at country/region level would affect the number of deaths reported and therefore
the estimated AMTRs. If all authorities would follow the strict guidance provided by the WHO , discrepancies will
15

be minimised reinforcing the reliability of the present method. For example, some scientists have shared concerns
on how mortality from COVID-19 is being ascertained in Belgium where people dying in care homes have been
classified as dying from COVID-19 based on indirect evidence (the presence of infection in the care home and the
reporting of compatible symptoms) . In addition, by calculating the cumulative mortality, any error in death
22

reporting would be carried on in the analysis. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that mortality does not solely
reflects the spread of disease: mortality from COVID-19 is function of disease incidence, severity, and quality of
healthcare systems to cope with infected and diseased people, therefore caution needs to be exerted when
interpreting the AMTRs. Moreover this method assumes that mortality remains constant over time in the given

populations. However, it is likely that the age-specific mortality rates calculated during the first phases of the
infection reflect an increased mortality of a more vulnerable population exposed to comorbidities. In future similar
studies, availability of age- and sex-specific mortality data on a continuing basis, at least from a selected sources,
would be useful in order to improve the method by using specific data from across the time course.

Contextualisation of the results
Reliable comparisons of impact of COVID-19 at regional or national level are essential for the monitoring of the
spread of diseases in space and over time, and are instrumental for the retrospective analysis of different nonpharmacological policies currently enforced in many affected countries

. Nonetheless these are often based on

23,24

confirmed cases, which suffer greatly from local testing policies , and the intrinsic properties of the serological
1

test .
14

For example, in a paper comparing confirmed cases in Nigeria and Italy , the difference was striking, but it is
25

unclear how much of it was due to differences in testing policies, and to the deeply different underlying age
structure of the populations in the two countries. This is also very relevant when comparing management policies
and emergency preparedness: in a study comparing China, Australia, and United States , confirmed cases were
26

used alongside crude mortality, overlooking the importance of the underlying difference in age structure of the
populations.

Conclusions and future directions
In a context of rapid production of scientific evidence aimed at contributing to the understanding and
management of a pandemic of devastating proportion such as the COVID-19 one, the release of solid, comparable
data should be a high priority. The method proposed in this paper allows comparisons of mortality in space and
over time. The authors urge the WHO to adopt this method to estimate the burden of COVID-19 pandemic
worldwide given the lack of international data by age and sex that can permit direct standardised rates.
