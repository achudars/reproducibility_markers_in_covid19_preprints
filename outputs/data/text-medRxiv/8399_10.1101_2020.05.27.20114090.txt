Abstract:

33

Background: Following early implementation of public health measures, San Francisco has

34

experienced a slow rise and a low peak level of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases

35

and deaths.

37

Methods and Findings: We included all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the

38

intensive care unit (ICU) at the safety net hospital for San Francisco through April 8, 2020. Each

39

patient had ≥15 days of follow-up. Among 26 patients, the median age was 54 years

40

(interquartile range, 43 to 62), 65% were men, and 77% were Latinx. Mechanical ventilation was

41

initiated for 11 (42%) patients within 24 hours of ICU admission and 20 patients (77%) overall.

42

The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 20).

43

Patients were managed with lung protective ventilation (tidal volume <8 ml/kg of ideal body

44

weight and plateau pressure ≤30 cmH2O on 98% and 78% of ventilator days, respectively).

45

Prone positioning was used for 13 of 20 (65%) ventilated patients for a median of 5 days

46

(interquartile range, 2 to 10). Seventeen (65%) patients were discharged home, 1 (4%) was

47

discharged to nursing home, 3 (12%) were discharged from the ICU, and 2 (8%) remain

48

intubated in the ICU at the time of this report. Three (12%) patients have died.

49
50

Conclusions: Good outcomes were achieved in critically ill patients with COVID-19 by using

51

standard therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) such as lung protective

52

ventilation and prone positioning. Ensuring hospitals can deliver sustained high-quality and

53

evidence-based critical care to patients with ARDS should remain a priority.

Introduction:

56

Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory

57

syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now the leading cause of death in the United States.1

58

The number of reported cases and deaths varies markedly in part due to regional variation in

59

public health responses to the pandemic.2-5

60
61

Initial reports of outcomes among adults with COVID-19 requiring intensive care unit (ICU)

62

admission showed high overall mortality (62% in China, 26% in Italy, 50% in the United

63

Kingdom, and 50-67% in the US) and mortality exceeding 80% among patients requiring

64

invasive mechanical ventilation.6-9 Mortality has been variable in subsequent reports but

65

exceeds 50% in nearly half of published studies.4,7,10-12 Many of these reports are from settings

66

that experienced surges of patients that overwhelmed hospital capacity and presented a

67

challenge to delivering standard ICU care.

68
69

San Francisco was among the first cities in the country to implement strong physical distancing

70

measures. The Mayor declared a state of emergency on February 25 and a regional shelter-in-

71

place order was issued on March 16.13,14 The ordinances occurred 28 days and 8 days,

72

respectively, before the first death from COVID-19 was reported in San Francisco on March 24.

73

These actions enabled healthcare systems to mobilize resources for COVID-19 admissions and

74

likely flattened the epidemic curve at a low peak level (1,312 cases of COVID-19 and 21 deaths

75

in San Francisco as of April 23).15

76
77

Here, we report the first detailed ICU case series from a healthcare system in the United States

78

with sufficient lead time and capacity to increase staffing of ICU care teams, establish dedicated

79

COVID-19 ICUs, and procure supplies and equipment. The objective is to describe the

80

demographics, clinical characteristics, ICU management and outcomes of critically ill patients

85

STUDY SETTING

86

ZSFG is a 284-bed hospital (58 ICU beds) operated by the San Francisco Department of Public

87

Health and staffed by physicians from the University of California San Francisco. It is the

88

primary provider of safety-net health care and 80% of its patient population receives publicly

89

funded health insurance or is uninsured. San Francisco is the second most densely populated

90

city in the United States and the hospital’s catchment includes a population of 881,549 within

91

46.7 square miles.

92
93

To date, COVID-19 ICU admissions have been clustered in two 10-bed ICUs. In addition to

94

regular staffing of medical and surgical ICUs, COVID-19 ICUs were staffed by dedicated

95

physician teams (one intensivist, one critical care fellow, and two internal medicine or

96

anesthesia residents per 10 patients), 1:1 nursing with an extra nurse supporting care for every

97

two mechanically ventilated patients, one respiratory therapist (RT) for up to 4 mechanically

98

ventilated patients with an extra RT available on each unit for additional support, and a

99

dedicated ICU pharmacist. Five ICU staff members including at least one RT and two COVID-19

100

ICU nurses supported prone positioning. A dedicated COVID-19 anesthesia team (one

101

attending physician and one advanced practice provider or resident physician) was available 24

102

hours a day for intubation bundled with placement of vascular access. During the study period,

103

the hospital did not experience shortages in critical equipment or most drugs, and at peak ICU

104

census, 43% of available ventilators were in use. Adequate personal protective equipment and

105

infection control measures were in place (only one clinical staff member has tested positive for

106

SARS-CoV-2 to date).

STUDY POPULATION AND DATA COLLECTION

109

All adults (18 years of age or older) admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure between

110

March 24 and April 8 and confirmed to have COVID-19 by an internally-validated reverse

111

transcription polymerase chain reaction assay were included. The UCSF Committee on Human

112

Research approved the study and waived the requirement for informed consent (researchers

113

analyzed only de-identified, anonymized data).

114
115

Data from the electronic medical record were extracted using a form in Research Electronic

116

Data Capture software (REDCap).16,17 We obtained demographic data, information on clinical

117

symptoms or signs at presentation, results of laboratory and radiologic studies, co-existing

118

conditions, daily ICU management data, and patient outcomes.

119
120

STUDY DEFINITIONS

121

Daily ventilator parameters, use and duration of mechanical ventilation, prone positioning and

122

neuromuscular blockade were collected through maximum 28 days of follow up. Patient

123

outcome data including hospitalization status were updated through May 10. Acute respiratory

124

distress syndrome (ARDS) was defined using the Berlin criteria.18

125
126

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

127

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data; results are reported as medians and

128

interquartile ranges or means and standard deviations, as appropriate. Categorical variables

129

were summarized as counts and percentages. Median and individual values for selected

130

ventilator parameters were plotted for each day of mechanical ventilation through 14 days of

131

follow up. Analysis was performed with Stata 15.1 software (StataCorp).19

Patients experienced symptoms for a median of 8 days (interquartile range, 5 to 13) prior to ICU

152

admission (Figure 1). Eleven (42%) patients were directly admitted to the ICU of whom 4

153

required immediate mechanical ventilation, and 7 were placed on high flow nasal cannula. Of 15

154

patients transferred to the ICU from an acute care bed, 11 (73%) were intubated within 24 hours

155

of transfer. The median APACHE II score was 15 (interquartile range, 11 to 19) at the time of

156

ICU admission (Table 1).20 Twenty (77%) patients met the Berlin criteria for ARDS with 19

157

categorized as having moderate to severe disease based on the ratio of the partial pressure of

158

Figure 1. Patient Clinical Course.
Clinical course is depicted from symptom onset as reported by the patient on admission through
termination of data collection on May 10, 2020. Patients had symptoms for a median duration of
8 days (IQR 5-13) before intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Fifteen (58%) patients were
hospitalized for a median duration of 2 days (IQR 1-2) before requiring ICU level care and 11
(42%) were admitted directly to the ICU. Twenty (77%) patients required mechanical ventilation
for a median duration of 13.5 days (IQR 5-20). As of May 10, 2020, 17 (65%) patients had been
discharged home, 1 (4%) had been discharged to a skilled nursing facility, 3 (12%) had been
transferred from ICU to acute care, and 2 (8%) remained on mechanical ventilation. Three
patients (12%) had died. Unless otherwise shown, the ICU admission is ongoing.

171

LABORATORY, RADIOLOGIC, AND MICROBIOLOGIC FINDINGS

172

The white blood cell count (WBC) was normal for most patients (median 9.9 x109/L; interquartile

173

range, 7.3 to 12.3), though leukocytosis (WBC >12 x109/L) and lymphopenia (<1 x109/L) were

174

present in 31% and 62% of patients, respectively (Table 1). Transaminitis was present in 46%

175

of patients. Most patients had elevated blood inflammatory markers, including D-dimer (74%),

176

lactate dehydrogenase (95%), ferritin (92%), and C-reactive protein (100%).

178

Chest radiographs obtained before ICU admission demonstrated bilateral infiltrates in 24 (92%),

179

unilateral infiltrates in 1 (4%), and no infiltrates in 1 (4%) (Table 1). Chest computed

180

tomography revealed bilateral ground glass opacities in 8 (89%) of 9 studies. At the time of ICU

181

admission, there were no viral co-infections among 23 patients tested and no culture-confirmed

182

bacterial co-infections.

183
184

CLINICAL COURSE AND TREATMENT

185

Six (23%) patients received supplemental oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and 20 (77%)

186

required mechanical ventilation during their ICU course (Figure 1). Adherence to lung protective

187

ventilation strategies for patients with ARDS was excellent. The median tidal volume delivered

188

was 6.0 ml/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) (interquartile range, 5.6 to 6.8) and remained ≤6 ml/kg

189

IBW on 72% of ventilator days and <8 ml/kg IBW on 98% of ventilator days. The median plateau

190

pressure on admission was 25 cmH2O (interquartile range, 22 to 28) and was ≤30 cmH2O on

191

78% of ventilator days. Among those receiving mechanical ventilation, daily ventilator

192

parameters showed marked patient-to-patient variation (Figure 2). The median severity of

193

ARDS was moderate at the onset of mechanical ventilation (PaO2:FiO2 159, interquartile range,

194

104 to 217). The median lung compliance was low at the onset of mechanical ventilation (31

195

mL/cmH2O, interquartile range, 23 to 39, normal is 50-100 mL/cmH2O) and stayed low over 14

196

days of follow-up. The median plateau pressure was ≤25 cmH2O on each of the first five days of

197

mechanical ventilation and increased to 25 to 30 cmH2O thereafter. Five patients (25%) had

198

driving pressures >14 cmH2O on the first day of mechanical ventilation and 65% of intubated

199

patients had a driving pressure >14 cmH2O on at least one day during follow-up.

Each white dot represents the daily value recorded closest to 8 AM for each patient on
mechanical ventilation. The black dot represents the median value for all measurements on a
given day of ventilation. PaO2 denotes partial pressure of arterial oxygen and FiO2 denotes the
fraction of inspired oxygen. Compliance is calculated using tidal volume divided by the
difference between the plateau and the positive end expiratory pressures. The driving pressure
is the difference between the plateau pressure and the positive end expiratory pressure.

208

In addition to lung protective ventilation, ARDS was primarily managed using standard therapies

209

for hypoxemic respiratory failure (Figure 3). In particular, 13 of 20 (65%) patients mechanically

210

ventilated were placed in the prone position for 16-20 hours a day for a median duration of 5

211

days (interquartile range, 2 to 10) and a maximum of 17 days (Table 2). Prone positioning was

212

initiated early in moderate to severe ARDS.21 At the time of initiation, the median PaO2 was 71

213

mmHg (interquartile range, 63 to 84), median FiO2 was 0.7 (interquartile range, 0.5 to 0.7) and

214

median PEEP was 12 cmH2O (interquartile range, 12 to 14). Twelve (46%) patients received

215

neuromuscular blockade for a median duration of 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 12). Four

216

(15%) patients received inhaled epoprostenol (median 11 days, interquartile range 3 to 12).

217

Mechanically ventilated patients required a high level of sedation (Table 2).

Two mutually exclusive clinical trials were enrolling patients during the study period. Twelve patients
(46%) were enrolled in a trial testing Remdesivir vs. placebo (NCT04257656) for Covid-19 disease, and 5
(19%) were enrolled in a trial testing human Mesenchymal Stromal Stem Cells vs. placebo
(NCT03818854) for severe ARDS.

Twenty (77%) patients required vasopressor support for a median duration of 6 days

234

(interquartile range, 4 to 13.5), and 5 (19%) patients needed continuous renal replacement

235

therapy (CRRT). No patients received systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive

236

medications for treatment of COVID-19. Three patients received systemic steroids for other

237

indications (one each for refractory septic shock, stridor, and bronchospasm with underlying

238

obstructive lung disease). Nine patients received therapeutic anticoagulation: 2 for confirmed

239

venous thromboembolic disease, 1 to prevent clotting of the CRRT circuit, and 6 for empiric

240

treatment of pulmonary embolism. Anti-coagulation was discontinued in 5 of 6 patients treated

241

empirically after negative imaging studies, and the sixth patient was not stable enough to obtain

242

imaging. Other treatments are summarized in Table 2.

243
244

OUTCOMES

245

Patients were followed for at least 21 hospital days. As of May 10, among the 26 patients, 17

246

(65%) were discharged home, 1 (4%) was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, 3 (12%) were

247

discharged to an acute care bed, and 2 (8%) were still in the ICU requiring mechanical

248

ventilation (Table 2). Three (12%) patients have died.

250

The median length of hospital admission was 15 days (interquartile range, 12 to 25), and the

251

median length of ICU admission was 9 days (interquartile range, 3 to 24). Twenty (77%)

252

patients were mechanically ventilated for a median of 13.5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 20).

253

Length of stay and length of mechanical ventilation are likely to be underestimated as 5 patients

254

remain in the hospital (including 2 still in the ICU). Four patients were referred and two were

255

transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) center. Other adverse ICU

256

outcomes included re-intubation within 48 hours for 1 patient and readmission to the ICU for 2

257

patients. Six (30%) mechanically ventilated patients were treated for ventilator-associated

258

pneumonia (VAP). One patient developed a catheter-associated urinary tract infection, but no

259

patients developed central-line associated infections.

261

Discussion:

262

We report for the first time the results of a case series of critically ill patients with COVID-19

263

from a region with early public health interventions to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and

264

adequate time and resources to prepare for COVID-19 ICU admissions. We had five weeks to

265

prepare from the time the Mayor declared a state of emergency to our first ICU patient with

266

COVID-19. Although we experienced a higher patient volume than normal, our hospital did not

267

experience any significant shortages of staff, pharmaceuticals, or equipment needed to provide

268

standard ICU management of ARDS. Findings from this case series differ from other published

269

data in two important ways: (1) mortality among critically ill patients with COVID-19, including

270

those mechanically ventilated, has been low, and (2) the lung compliance observed in patients

271

with COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS has been similar to reported values in patients with

272

ARDS from other causes. Overall, our findings reinforce the importance of public health

273

measures such as physical distancing to enable hospitals to deliver standard care to critically ill

274

patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia.

276

There are several potential explanations for the lower mortality observed in our cohort

277

compared with previous case series. Patients in this cohort were younger than in previously

278

published case series and were admitted from the community rather than skilled nursing

279

facilities. However, approximately three-quarters had a comorbidity previously associated with

280

worse outcomes in COVID-19 pneumonia and nearly half had two such comorbidities. Our

281

patients were also comparable to other cohorts by standard assessment of severity of illness

282

including length of stay, vasopressor use, need for continuous renal replacement therapy, and

283

APACHE II score.9 Despite adherence to lung protective ventilation, a substantial fraction of

284

patients had high driving pressures, a metric associated with mortality in ARDS.22 These data, in

285

combination with the use of advanced management for hypoxemic respiratory failure and CRRT

286

in a substantial proportion of patients, argue against the possibility that our low observed

287

mortality reflects a less severely ill population.

288
289

Patient care at our institution was focused on proven therapies for ARDS including lung

290

protective ventilation, a fluid conservative strategy, and the use of prone positioning and

291

neuromuscular blockade for moderate to severe disease.21,23-30 Adherence to lung protective

292

ventilation for ARDS is known to be generally poor and has not been reported in prior case

293

series of COVID-19 related ARDS.31 However, one can infer that in healthcare systems under

294

stress, barriers to implementing these protocols would be even more difficult to overcome. We

295

presume a key driver of good outcomes in this cohort was also our ability to mobilize sufficient

296

critical care trained physician and non-physician staff. Our data suggest that among severely ill

297

patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 pneumonia, good outcomes can be achieved so

298

long as healthcare systems are not overwhelmed and are able to deliver evidence-based

299

treatments for ARDS and hypoxemic respiratory failure for prolonged periods. However, clinical

300

trials of experimental treatments to reduce the need for ICU admission, duration of ICU

301

admission and long-term outcomes remain critically important.

303

Our data suggest that the pulmonary physiology of COVID-19 pneumonia is variable with a

304

range of compliance values similar to ARDS cohorts before the COVID-19 pandemic.22,32,33

305

While the median values of compliance and tidal compliance may be marginally higher than

306

what is reported in studies of ARDS from other causes, we did not observe a preponderance of

307

a high compliance phenotype of COVID-19 ARDS that has been reported elsewhere.34-36 We

308

managed our ventilators with standard ARDSNet protocols and did not alter our supportive care

309

strategies for patients with ARDS from COVID-19.

310
311

Our study has several limitations. First, this is a small cohort of patients from a single center

312

with censoring of outcome data for 8 patients who remain intubated without adjudication of

313

ultimate disposition. Mortality may be underestimated but would still be at most 40% in

314

ventilated patients, similar to what has been reported for moderate to severe ARDS.31 Second,

315

our COVID-19 ICU staffing model and resource mobilization was possible due to monetary

316

support from emergency funds and may not be generalizable in particular to private or non-

317

academically affiliated healthcare systems. Last, our study was not designed to evaluate

318

reasons for the high proportion of Latinx patients in our cohort (77%) compared to the usual

319

patients who receive care in our hospital (25%), an important disparity that requires further

320

study.

321
322

Our early experience of the COVID-19 pandemic substantively adds to what is known about

323

outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and does not resemble the

324

experience reported in many other settings. Majority of patients (81%) have been discharged

325

from the ICU, including 65% who have been discharged home. Early efforts to develop

326

coordinated local and regional response plans with contingency planning for personnel,

327

equipment, and pharmaceutical shortages are vital to prepare for later phases of this pandemic

328

with anticipated ebbs and flows in patient volume. While awaiting the results of clinical trials and

329

ultimately an effective vaccine, our findings highlight the ongoing importance of public health
