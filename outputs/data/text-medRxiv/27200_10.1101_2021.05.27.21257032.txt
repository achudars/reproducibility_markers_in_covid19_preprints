Abstract
We hypothesised that cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs)
could have affected SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including generating reduced susceptibility in children.
To determine what the pre-pandemic distribution of immunity to HCoVs was, we fitted a mathematical
model to 6 years of seasonal coronavirus surveillance data from England and Wales. We estimated a
duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7.3 years (95%CI 6.8 - 7.9) and show that, while
cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution, it is
insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in
England and Wales. Projections from our model illustrate how different strengths of cross-protection
between circulating coronaviruses could determine the frequency and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2
epidemics over the coming decade, as well as the potential impact of cross-protection on future
seasonal coronavirus transmission.

Significance statement:
Cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) has been hypothesised
to contribute to the relative sparing of children during the early phase of the pandemic. Testing this
relies on understanding the pre-pandemic age-distribution of recent HCoV infections, but little is
known about their dynamics. Using England and Wales as a case study, we use a transmission model
to estimate the duration of immunity to seasonal coronaviruses, and show how cross-protection could
have affected the age distribution of susceptibility during the first wave, and alter SARS-CoV-2
transmission patterns over the coming decade.

Introduction
Due to the relatively short time since SARS-CoV-2 emerged, little is yet known about the duration of
infection-induced immunity. While instances of confirmed reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 have been
identified1, these are rare,2 indicating protection lasts for at least 6-8 months, which concurs with
estimates from prospective studies3,4. For the success of long-term planning and design of control
strategies against SARS-CoV-2, including vaccines, we must increase our understanding of the
population-level immunity dynamics and interactions with other circulating viruses.
In order to evaluate the impacts of cross-immunity, we first need to quantify the duration of immune
protection from seasonal coronaviruses. Four coronaviruses strains from two different genera are
endemic in humans: two are alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63) and two are
betacoronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43); SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the latter genera as are
SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. In the UK, seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV) case incidence peaks
January-February each year. The first infection with seasonal HCoVs typically occurs in childhood5
and reinfection with the same strain has been observed within a year6,7. However, there are also
indications that immunity lasts longer, with few reinfections in a 3-year cohort study8 and sterilising
immunity to homologous strains of HCoV-229E after one year in a challenge study9.
There may also be cross-protective immunity between seasonal HCoVs and SARS-family
coronaviruses following infection. Human sera collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic showed
high IgG reactivity to seasonal HCoVs, but also low reactivity to SARS-CoV-210, and SARS-CoV-1
infection induced antibody production against seasonal HCoVs11,12. Cross-reactive T-cells to

SARS-CoV-2 have been found in 20%13 to 51%14 of unexposed individuals, with evidence that these
responses stem from seasonal coronavirus infection15. It has also been noted that these are more
prevalent in children and adolescents16.
Cross-protection from seasonal HCoVs may have, therefore, partially shaped the observed
epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In particular, this cross-protection could help to explain the relatively
low SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in children17–21. Since children likely have a higher annual attack rate
of endemic HCoVs due to their higher contact rates22, they may be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
due to cross-protection. Using England and Wales as a case study, we use dynamic models to
estimate: 1) the duration of infection-induced immunity to seasonal HCoVs, 2) the ability of potential
cross-protection from seasonal HCoVs to explain the age patterns in the first wave of the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and 3) the implications of the duration of immunity and potential
cross-protection on future dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Seasonal HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 epidemic data
We extracted monthly, age group-stratified numbers of HCoV positive tests in England and Wales
from the June 9, 2014 to February 17, 202023 and daily number of COVID-19 deaths in England and
Wales during the first wave of the pandemic (March 02, 2020 to June 01, 2020)24 (Figure 1). The
timeframe for the HCoV data is from the first available date until February 2020 to avoid interference
from SARS-CoV-2 transmission and reporting.

then become infectious (I). They then recover (R) and via waning become fully susceptible again. At
any point individuals can be infected by the other virus, although this is less likely to occur in the I and
R categories, determined by the cross-protection parameter. For clarity, ageing, seasonality, births
and deaths are not shown in this Figure. The initial model fit without SARS-CoV-2 only contains
individuals within the compartments in the dashed box.
We fitted a dynamic transmission model using England and Wales as a case study (Figure 1C, box)
using only the seasonal coronavirus model. Following infection, individuals are protected against
infection with any seasonal HCoVs, with reinfection possible after a period of temporary but complete
immunity. Waning of immunity against circulating viruses could result from decaying protection against
homotypic viruses, and/or longer-lasting immunity against homotypic viruses but evolutionary change
leading to immune escape 25. We do not track individual seasonal HCoV strains as available data are
not sub-typed. We therefore assume that individual seasonal HCoV strain have the same parameter
values, including duration of immunity and R0,HCoV. Transmission is seasonally forced using a cosine
function.

Immunity to seasonal HCoVs is estimated to last around 7 years
We fitted the model to the age group-specific seasonal HCoV data from June 09, 2014 until February
17, 2020, and estimated key seasonal HCoV parameters using parallel tempering26 (Figure 2). We
fitted the duration of infection-induced immunity, the transmissibility, age-specific reporting
proportions and two seasonal forcing parameters (Table S1). We estimated that the average duration
of infection-induced immunity for seasonal HCoVs was 7.3 years (95% Credible Interval (CI): 6.8 7.9) and that the basic reproduction number was 5.7 (95% CI 5.4 - 6.0) (Figure 2B). Further details
are given in the Supplement.

Cross-protection from seasonal HCoVs is not sufficient to explain age-specific patterns of
SARS-CoV-2 infection
We included SARS-CoV-2 into the model, where each compartment has the state for the combined
seasonal HCoVs as well as the state for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1C, full model). We included
cross-protection that decreases susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV-2 by an amount, σ, for
individuals in the IHCoV,i or RHCoV,i states (σ = 0 is no cross-protection and 1 is full cross-protection). We
assume any interaction in the opposite direction would be negligible, due to the low proportion of the
population that were infected in the first SARS-CoV-2 epidemic wave.
Using the posterior estimates of the seasonal HCoV parameters and the simulated output as initial
states, we continued a simulation of epidemic seasonal HCoVs from the January 01, 2020 until June
01, 2020, including the introduction of SARS-CoV-2. Cross-protection from seasonal HCoVs and
different mixing patterns (matching observed lockdown patterns, see Methods) were the only
mechanisms we included that affected infection by SARS-CoV-2, so that we could evaluate the impact
of cross-protection on the observed age distribution of cases.
For values of the cross-protection parameter between σ=0 and σ=1, we estimated R0,C19 and the
number of introductions of SARS-CoV-2 by fitting the extended model to daily reported COVID-19
deaths (Figure 3a). We captured the national lockdown by decreasing contact rates following trends in
Google mobility data27. Our model fits were able to closely match the reported mortality incidence for
each value of the cross-protection parameter. However, the resulting R0,C19 varied widely, reaching
over 25 for the strongest cross-protection (Figure 3B). The corresponding Reff,C19 before the
intervention on March 23 ranged between 2.25 and 3.75 (see Supplement).

We then evaluated the age distribution of infections that would be detected by serology by the end of
May in our model, across the range of values of the cross-protection parameter (Figure 1C). In
simulations with no or low cross-protection the model predicted larger proportions of children to have
been infected than in older age groups, differing from observed data17,28. As the strength of interaction
increased, the age-distribution flattened and a smaller proportion of children became infected. With
complete protection, there was a higher rate in the youngest age groups, which has not been
observed19–21,28.

Future SARS-CoV2 epidemiology could be shaped by coronavirus interactions
To determine possible long-term dynamics of interacting coronaviruses, we ran 30-year projections of
our model including both HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2, with different assumptions on the strength of
cross-protection and whether it acted from HCoV to SARS-CoV-2, or in both directions (Figure 4, and
further samples in the supplement). In all scenarios we assumed no interventions, and used
parameters estimated previously. For single-direction cross-protection, annual SARS-CoV-2
epidemics were projected to occur in scenarios with stronger cross-protection, whereas weaker / no
cross-protection projected less frequent epidemics. However, strong cross-protection scenarios relied
on very high and potentially unrealistic R0. In weaker cross-protection scenarios, interepidemic
periods lasted multiple years following a pandemic. In scenarios with bi-directional cross-protection,
SARS-CoV-2 infections also projected frequent epidemics, but led to the seasonal HCoV being

disrupted. With low levels of cross-protection, SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoV epidemics alternated,
but as the cross-protection increased, SARS-CoV-2 epidemics became more frequent and
outcompeted seasonal HCoV: while a cross-protection of 0.6 resulted in irregular dynamics of the
viruses. At higher levels of cross-protection, no seasonal HCoV transmission occurred.

Discussion
We estimated that immunity to seasonal HCoVs lasts 7.3 years (95% CI: 6.8 - 7.9) and that the R0 is
5.7 (95% CI: 5.4 - 6.0). We found 12.8% (95% CI: 11.9 - 13.7%) reinfection within one year, and the
median reinfection time was 5.1 years (95% CI: 4.7 - 5.5 years). It was possible to match the
COVID-19 mortality data with the full range of cross-protection strengths between seasonal HCoV and
SARS-CoV-2, but the estimated R0,C19 s were outside of a realistic range for very high values of cross
protection, for example, a recent multi-setting study estimating the R0,C19 to be between 3.6 and 7.329.
Cross-protection from seasonal HCoVs to SARS-CoV-2 did not fully explain the apparent reduced
susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 observed during the first wave in the UK17,18,20,21,28. Future
projections varied in the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics, with SARS-CoV-2 epidemics every two
years at low levels of cross-protection, changing to annual epidemics with increased cross-protection.
In scenarios with bi-directional cross-protection, epidemics were less predictable and SARS-CoV-2
out competed seasonal HCoVs. Further elucidating possible cross-protection and potential duration of
protection is therefore critical for medium-to-long-term projections of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.

Our estimates for the duration of homotypic protection following HCoV infection are comparable with
other estimates, such as a cohort study where 8/216 (3%) confirmed infected individuals were
reinfected over 5 years, and the median re-infection time in a study of 10 individuals30 varied between
30 and 55 months, depending on strain. However, estimates vary, with a larger study in Michigan
estimating mean strain-specific reinfection to be between 19 and 33 months31, 19.9% of first infections
being reinfected within 6 months in Kenya32, and a historical study, of just one seasonal HCoV strain
(229E), estimating the time until T cells could no longer neutralise new strains at 8-17 years25. Other
coronaviruses can also give indications on the duration of immunity, with T cells to SARS-CoV-1
detectable up to 11 years post-infection33. Using a similar modelling approach to that presented here,
others have estimated that the average duration of immunity to seasonal coronavirus could be
substantially shorter, under a year34. However, this implies very high annual attack rates, which are
not observed in surveillance data, and our model suggests that a longer period of cross-protection
may be more appropriate, and should be included in the proposed range of parameters for fitting such
models.
Our model suggests that cross-protection between seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 could account
for some of the reduced susceptibility to infection of children in the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2
epidemic in England and Wales. Specifically, stronger cross-protection decreased the relative
susceptibility to infection of children. This is in line with an American study showing that 50% of
pre-pandemic donors had reactive T-cells to SARS-CoV-235 and serological markers for a recent
seasonal HCoV infection, suggesting that immune responses to seasonal HCoV could elicit
cross-protective immunity. Moreover, 48% of uninfected individuals in a cohort from Australia had
cross-reactive T-cells to SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity was strongly correlated with memory of a
seasonal coronavirus strains15. Other studies among healthy individuals without SARS-CoV-2
exposure found cross-reactive T-cells targeting SARS-CoV-2 in 51%36, 35%14 24%37, and 20%13 of
participants, suggesting a moderate amount of cross-immunity that likely stems from seasonal
coronaviruses. There are indications that these cross-reactive T cells are present at higher frequency
in younger vs older adults, correlating with our hypothesis that this could be due to increased infection
from seasonal HCoVs38. Antibodies have also been shown to be cross-reactive39, although their
persistence in the body is more varied and often shorter in duration than T-cells40. Cross-reactive
responses have also been identified in other pandemic coronaviruses10–12,41, with some also showing
cross-protection: SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV T cell epitopes where protective in mice against other
human and bat coronaviruses42. However a longitudinal study showed that whilst cross-reactive HCoV
antibodies are boosted following SARS-CoV-2 infection, this does not correlate with protection against
infection or hospitalisation43 and a lack of antibody-mediated neutralising cross-protection has been
noted between sera from SARS-CoV-1 patients and SARS-CoV-244. Therefore, whilst there is
significant amounts of corroborating evidence that our find of some degree of cross-protection exists,
the literature is not conclusive.
Our results indicate that cross-protection from seasonal coronaviruses alone cannot explain reduced
susceptibility to infection of children. Other factors are needed to counteract the children’s higher than
average exposure probability driven by their contact behavior22. One mechanism for this could be due
to differences in children’s immune system45: children can produce broadly reactive antibodies that
have not been influenced by commonly circulating pathogens and have different proportions of blood
cell types, such as specific subtypes of memory B cells. Genetic analysis also suggests that
cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens can not fully be explained by seasonal coronaviruses,
implying that other unknown viruses/factors may induce cross-immunity46. We also modelled
cross-protection as only reducing susceptibility to infection, whereas there could also be a reduction in
transmission and/or disease severity47–50. Boosting of immunity by multiple infections has also been
suggested to influence cross-protection48, where boosting by repeat infections was hypothesised to
reduce the cross-protection to SARS-CoV-2. We did not include boosting in our model due to the
added complexity.

The strength and implications of cross-protection between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 will become
increasingly evident over the coming months and years. Our projections show that, depending on the
extent of cross-protection, SARS-CoV-2 could eventually cause annual epidemics (strong
cross-protection) or epidemics every 2 years (little cross-protection). If bi-directional cross-protection
occurs, SARS-CoV-2 also has the ability to substantially disrupt seasonal HCoV transmission. This is
based on our fit of the duration of immunity and the seasonal forcing parameters of seasonal HCoVs,
which are likely to differ to some extent in the case of SARS-CoV-2. These scenarios are in line with
others34,51–53, which suggest that ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely. Our modelled projections
assumed that no interventions were implemented. However, HCoV circulation was disrupted in winter
2020–202140 likely due to social restrictions designed to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is
important to understand the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, in order to minimise deaths and
plan vaccination strategies. From an evolutionary perspective, cross-protection may be a strong driver
for selection, so in the long run a less transmissible type with greater cross-protection against
competing viruses may dominate.
We modelled all seasonal HCoVs as one virus, implicitly assuming complete cross-protection
between them. There is evidence for cross-protection between seasonal HCoVs, such as the
presence of cross-reactive antibodies55 and evidence from modelling studies34. Yet cross-protection
may not be complete, or may be strain specific (alpha vs beta coronaviruses), and hence our
assumption could lead to an underestimation of the true duration of protection. This is because the
duration between subsequent homotypic infections would be longer than subsequent infections of any
strain, for the same number of cases. We expect the assumption of modelling seasonal HCoVs to
have a relatively small impact on the results of the cross-protection in the first wave of SARS-CoV-2,
which uses the average cross-immunity profile at the end of the seasonal HCoV epidemic. However,
the assumption may have a larger impact on the longer term dynamics, so these should be
interpreted with caution. We also assumed that the strength of immunity to seasonal HCoVs is
constant over repeated infections. An alternative mechanism would be that repeat infections
strengthen immunity, as is hypothesised in some respiratory infections, such as Respiratory Syncytial
Virus56, which could have led to a different estimate of immunity.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has highlighted our lack of knowledge on coronavirus immunity and
long term dynamics. In our study, we estimate that immunity against seasonal HCoVs can last years,
however by necessity we made strong assumptions about the cross-immunity between seasonal
HCoV strain. Further studies exploring cross-protection between strain for seasonal coronaviruses as
well as routinely subtyped surveillance data would help inform future models. Nonetheless, based on
the available data our study indicates that seasonal coronavirus immunity may last multiple years,
which should be considered in the planning of subsequent studies. We also conclude that
cross-protection from seasonal coronaviruses is not enough to explain the age susceptibility pattern of
SARS-CoV-2, indicating other mechanisms must be involved. Whilst serological data could be useful
to further evaluate the extent of cross-protection, the reduction in social contacts due to government
interventions against SARS-CoV-2 complicates their use. Our models relies heavily on social contact
matrices, and getting an accurate understanding of social contacts in the last year comes with many
challenges, such as multiple changes in public health interventions with uncertain adherence. Our
study highlights the importance of understanding the background environment of coronaviruses for
insights into SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progression.
Materials and Methods
We created a dynamic transmission model that includes cross-protection between seasonal HCoVs
and SARS-CoV-2, using the UK as a case study (Figure 1). Initially, we fit the model without
SARS-CoV-2 and estimated key seasonal HCoV parameters. Next we simulated SARS-CoV-2

We extracted the monthly, age group-stratified number of HCoV positive tests in England and Wales
between June 09, 2014 and February 17, 2020, from National Health Service (NHS) and Public
Health England (PHE) laboratories21. The reported age groups are ages 0-4, 5-14, 15-44, 45-64 and
65+. We did not use data beyond February 2020, as we wanted to estimate seasonal HCoV
parameters in the absence of SARS-CoV-2.
For SARS-CoV-2, we used the daily number of deaths with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive test in
the preceding 28 days from March 02, 2020 until May 31, 2020 reported by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS)24.
Cross-protection Model
We created a deterministic compartmental transmission model for coronavirus infections and their
interactions. The population are either Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I) and Recovered (R)
for both seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2. The subscripts used are “HCoV” for seasonal HCoVs and
“C19” for SARS-CoV-2, with no differentiation between HCoV strains as the data are not sub-typed.
Following infection, individuals enter the exposed category and become infected at rates λHCoV ,i and
λC19,i respectively, and individuals enter the infectious category at rates νHCoV and νC19. They then
recover and become fully susceptible again at rate ω . The force of infection for each virus is shown in
equations 1 and 2. Each compartment in the model records the state for SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal
HCoVs, with one for each combination of states (Figure 1) and all durations are exponentially
distributed. At any point individuals can be infected by the other virus, although this is less likely to
occur in the I and R categories, determined by the cross-protection parameter, σ . This takes into
account both short term cross-protection from the activation of the immune system, and longer-term
adaptive immunity. Both modelled viruses (HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2) are seasonally forced with a
cosine function, which captures changes in seasonal human behaviour and climatic factors.

As the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 stayed below 5% during the modelled period, we assumed
that the level of cross-protection conferred by SARS-CoV-2 on HCoV is negligible during the first
epidemic wave. Cross-protection was the only mechanism we included for differing susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection by age group, so that we could test whether it explained the observed infection
pattern.

The modelled population was stratified into 5-year bands to 75+, with constant birth rates, matching
death rates and ageing in line with the population of England and Wales (see Table 1).
Age-assortative mixing was modelled proportionately to patterns of conversational and physical
contacts in the POLYMOD study22,58.
We ran a HCoV-only model for 15 years to reach equilibrium, and a further 5 years to generate
simulations to match the data on seasonal HCoV cases from June 09, 2014 to February 17, 2020.

Inferring seasonal HCoV parameters
We used reported seasonal HCoV cases from June 09, 2014 until February 17, 2020 to avoid overlap
with SARS-CoV-2, where potential cross-protection could have occurred. We defined a binomial
likelihood, where modelled infection incidence maps to reported cases via an age-dependent
reporting proportion, pi . We assume equal reporting rates in age groups 5-15 and 45-65 to reduce
the dimensions of the model, as initial fitting suggested these were very similar. The likelihood is
therefore:
i=N X

log(L) ～ ∑ ∑ k x,i log(pi ) + (nx,i
i=1 x=1

­k

x,i )log(1

­p),
i

(3)

where L is the likelihood, i is age group to a total of N age groups, x are the reported monthly time
points, kx,i are the reported HCoV cases by age group, nx,i are the model estimated infections per age
group and pi is the age-specific reporting rate.
We fit the model to the data using parallel tempering, adapted from Vousden et al.22 which is based on
Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) inference. Unlike MCMC, multiple chains at different
temperatures are run in parallel and swaps of parameter positions between chains are proposed. This
allows more comprehensive exploration of the parameter space and allows the chains to move out of
local maxima. We ran two sets of 16 chains and confirmed their convergence with the Gelman-Rubin
statistic67, which was <1.1. We then combined the sample from both chains, excluding the burn-in, in
order to increase sample size, resulting in 93900 samples. See supplement for more details.
The percentage infected within one year and the median duration to reinfection were calculated using
distribution and quantile functions from the stats R package57.
Simulating SARS-CoV-2 with a range of strengths of cross-protection
We drew 100 random samples from the joint posterior distribution and simulated daily deaths reported
in the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in England and Wales, between March 02, 2020 and
May 31, 2020. We explored the full range of possible cross-protection strengths, in each case fitting
the transmission and introduction rates to the death data using maximum likelihood estimation with a

Poisson likelihood. We therefore created 100 simulations of HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 circulation for
each strength of cross-protection.
Due to the non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented in this period (“lockdown”), we adjust the
contact matrices, which are split into three categories: school contacts, household contacts and all
other contacts. From February 21, 2020, when Google mobility data becomes available, we adjust our
“other” contacts in line with google mobility data. From February 23, 2020, we eliminate school
contacts and assume that all remaining contacts are reduced to 33% of their transmission potential,
due to social distancing and behavioral changes (“micro-distancing”)68. SARS-CoV-2 importations
occur from February 15, 2020 until lockdown. See supplement for more details on the implementation
of public health interventions.
To look at the proportion infected during the first wave we assumed that antibodies would take 3
weeks to rise to detectable levels after infection and not wane below the detection threshold during
the study period69.

Projecting future dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and Seasonal HCoVs
We ran the model for 30 years, from January 01, 2020 without any changes in contacts, in order to
project the future dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. As inputs, we used the estimated parameters from the
seasonal HCoV fits, as well as the estimated transmission and introduction rates fitted for each of the
samples. Projections for 10 of the samples are shown (in Figure 4 and Supplement).
