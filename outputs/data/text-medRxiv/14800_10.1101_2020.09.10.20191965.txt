Abstract
We compared the total excess mortality per week in relation to the reported Covid-19 related

deaths in the Stockholm region (Sweden). Total excess mortality peaked under the weeks of

high

COVID-19-related

mortality, but 25%

of these deaths were not recognized as Covid-

related. Most of these deaths occurred outside hospitals. Total all-cause mortality in excess to

average all-cause mortality during the epidemic peak period may provide a comprehensive

picture of the total burden of COVID19-related deaths.

public health data nor by the regional morgue.

Stockholm (Figure). Data from the regional morgue had similar findings, with minor shifts in

the reported timing of deaths (Figure). In agreement with other countries , only 23.6% of the

reported COVID-19-related deaths had occurred in hospitals. Moreover, as expected, a much

larger number of COVID-19-related deaths had occurred in other caretaking institutions, such

as nursing homes for the elderly (Figure). For the remaining cases of reported COVID-19-

related deaths the location of the death was not recorded on the death certificate.

population-based reporting systems. The well-established reporting infrastructure is likely to

have identified a high proportion of all COVID-19-related deaths. The proportion of the total

excess mortality that was recognized as COVID-19-related in our study (c. 75%) is probably a

high estimate. That is, we predict that the total global death toll of the COVID-19 epidemic is

conceivably more than 1.1 million deaths (>850,000/0.75). Strengths of our study is that we

19-related deaths.

between COVID-19-related mortality data and total excess mortality has also been noted by

. Reporting systems based mostly on hospitals are likely to capture only a

small

fraction of the mortality burden. In our study, only 18% (0.24 x 0.75) of the excess mortality

was reported as COVID-19-related based on hospital data. Some COVID-19 fatalities may have

The

of

pandemic on the healthcare system and on healthcare-seeking behavior may also have caused

some deaths, not directly induced by the virus.

Timely estimated mortality is essential to pinpoint the peak of mortality during epidemics,

such as in COVID-19-related deaths. As such, all-cause total mortality has globally substantially

increased

during

the

COVID-19

pandemic.

Taken

together,

we

suggest

that

total

excess

mortality, calculated from ongoing all-cause mortality and compared to the all-cause mortality

in the previous 10 years, during the epidemic peak period in a population may give a more

comprehensive picture of the total burden of COVID19-related deaths.

Note that only a proportion of the excess mortality is recognized as COVID-19-related and that

only a very small proportion is derived from recognized COVID-19-related deaths in hospitals.
