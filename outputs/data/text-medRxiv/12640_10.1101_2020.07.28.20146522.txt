ABSTRACT

25

Introduction: In response to the Coronavirus pandemic, medical schools suspended clinical

26

rotations. This displacement of students from the wards has limited experiential learning

27

opportunities. Concurrently, outpatient practices are experiencing reduced volumes of in-person

28

visits and shifting towards virtual healthcare. This transition comes with its own logistical

29

challenges. Here, we discuss a workflow that enabled students to engage in meaningful clinical

30

education while helping the RWJMS outpatient practices implement remote telehealth visits.

31

Methods: A four-week virtual elective was designed to offer clerkship students the opportunity

32

to participate in virtual telehealth patient encounters. Students were prepared with EMR training

33

and introduced to an outpatient workflow that supports healthcare providers in the ambulatory

34

setting. Patients were consented to telehealth services before encounters with students. All

35

collected clinical information was documented in the EMR, after which students transitioned

36

patients to a virtual Doxy.me video call appointment. Clinical and educational outcomes of

37

studentsâ€™ participation were evaluated. Results: Survey results showed students felt well-

38

prepared to initiate patient encounters. They also expressed comfort while engaging with patients

39

virtually during telehealth appointments. Students further identified educational value, citing

40

opportunities to develop patient management plans consistent with in-person clinical

41

experiences. A significant healthcare burden was also alleviated by student involvement. Over

42

1000 total scheduled appointments were serviced by students who transitioned over 80% of

43

patients into virtual provider waiting rooms. Discussion: After piloting this elective with rising

44

fourth-year students, pre-clerkship students were also recruited to act in a role normally

45

associated with clinical learners (e.g., elicit patient histories, conduct a review of systems, etc.).

46

An additional telehealth elective is being designed so medical students can contribute to inpatient

INTRODUCTION

50

On March 17th, 2020, the AAMC issued strong guidance that medical schools suspend clinical

51

rotations during the Coronavirus pandemic, effective immediately.1 A temporary and unified

52

suspension by all institutions would provide the medical education community with time to

53

ensure the safety of their displaced clinical learners as new information about COVID-19

54

continued to emerge. Medical schools following this guidance au courant are developing

55

innovative curricular modifications to deliver uncompromised education during the ongoing

56

pandemic. Over the past ten weeks, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School (RWJMS)

57

has successfully introduced a new telehealth elective designed as a unique educational

58

opportunity to use telehealth technologies for healthcare delivery in service of Robert Wood

59

Johnson Medical Group (RWJMG) patients.

60

Under normal circumstances, the RWJMG outpatient practices care for approximately

61

15,000 patients each week. The Commonwealth Fund estimated outpatient practices were

62

scheduling less than half their normal volume of in-person visits throughout March to mitigate

63

community transmission of the novel Coronavirus.2 For the numerous practices struggling to

64

care for their patient population, the ability to extend patient-provider relationships beyond

65

traditional in-person visits is invaluable. We developed a telehealth workflow in coordination

66

with RWJMG practice managers to facilitate efficient diagnosis, treatment, management, and

67

education as providers embraced the virtual setting. Students were instrumental during this

68

transition and ultimately reduced a significant workforce burden whilst gaining valuable

69

exposure to a modern healthcare intervention.

METHODS

71

Objectives

72

Rising fourth-year medical students were recruited throughout March and April 2020 to pilot this

73

elective for a four-week period. To ensure satisfaction of curricular competencies, several

74

objectives were defined for students to: (1) understand the broad applications of telehealth

75

interventions in the outpatient setting, (2) develop fluency with telehealth technologies to support

76

virtual appointments, (3) learn from clinicians and implement techniques to interact with patients

77

during virtual appointments, (4) use telehealth modalities for assessment of clinical status and

78

risk of decompensation, (5) develop a plan of care and counsel patients throughout virtual

79

appointments, and (6) communicate with patients about health literacy and other social

80

determinants of health that may affect the success of virtual appointments. These objectives

81

further served as guidance for the delivery of high-quality patient care in the virtual setting.

82

Outpatient Workflow

83

Students attended mandatory training sessions to become familiar with our electronic medical

84

record (EMR) and the workflow (Figure 1) described as follows. When attending physicians

85

request student support, a Microsoft Excel workbook is populated with their contact information

86

and deidentified appointment times in half-day increments. Automated emails are generated

87

throughout the week to alert students as the Excel workbook populates with new attending

88

physicians and their respective appointment times. Students can indicate availability to support

89

attending physicians via a hyperlink provided in these emails. We also require that students

90

contact each respective attending physician and confirm their request for student support before

91

servicing any patients.

92

Students initiate contact with patients by phone call approximately 30 minutes before

93

their scheduled appointment time. The dialer feature of the Doximity application is used to

94

protect personal phone numbers, and the subsequent patient encounter is documented in the

95

EMR via remote access. A new document type was created in the EMR for telehealth patient

96

encounters to satisfy documentation requirements. This telehealth note requires information

97

about the visit type (phone call or video call), the method used to connect the patient (phone,

98

Doxy.me, FaceTime, other), the patientâ€™s location (state), and the attending physicianâ€™s location

99

(clinical office, Rutgers location other than clinical office, home or other non-Rutgers location).

100

Before collecting any clinical information, the patient is provided with information about the

101

risks and benefits of telehealth services. Their verbal consent to participate in telehealth services

102

is obtained and students proceed with the patient encounter thereafter. A chief complaint and

103

history of present illness are collected first, after which a review of systems and medication

104

reconciliation are conducted. Vital signs are then obtained from personal home health monitoring

105

equipment if available (e.g., scales, thermometers, blood pressure monitors, etc.). All clinical

106

information is entered into the telehealth note where applicable.

107

Next, students transition the patient encounter from the initial phone call to a Doxy.me

108

video call. This HIPAA-compliant telehealth system provides a cloud-based video conferencing

109

platform with a virtual waiting room feature for providers to triage and connect with patients at

110

their appointment time. Students use skills attained from the training sessions to troubleshoot

111

technological difficulties and other issues that may arise during the transition. Students hold their

112

preliminary note in the EMR for use by the attending physician and exit the patient encounter

113

once this transition to Doxy.me is successful. Debrief sessions are held by select attending

114

physicians after certain patient encounters to provide feedback and educate students where

115

appropriate.

116

To be eligible for elective course credit, students must complete a survey each time they

117

log contributed hours. The survey encompasses barriers to successful telehealth utilization.

118

Various appointment and workflow data are collected to enable retrospective analysis and real-

119

time process improvement. Two weeks of elective course credit are granted per 40 hours of

120

support contributed. Students will write a one-page reflection on their experience with telehealth

121

and virtual patient care.

RESULTS

123

Educational Outcomes

124

Our previously defined educational objectives were not strictly measured. Rather, this elective

125

was optimized to serve patients of the RWJMG outpatient practices. Surveyed students provided

126

positive informal feedback about the workflow, which enabled confident use of the EMR and

127

telehealth technologies. Many felt they were able to explore the capabilities of virtual patient

128

encounters while receiving practical instruction about various aspects of telehealth.

129

Given the large selection of participating specialty and subspecialty attending physicians at

130

RWJMG, students were able to serve a broad spectrum of patients. Students who supported

131

attending physicians with fewer scheduled patients were able to develop patient management

132

plans and participate extensively during the patient encounter. Students also found interviewing

133

patients, collecting a history, and documenting the encounter all provided significant educational

134

value.

135

Surveys also proved an invaluable source of information for process improvement.

136

Students were required to enumerate any barriers to initiating patient encounters. They learned

137

how to assist patient with these barriers to ensure a successful telehealth visit. This enumeration

138

of barriers further afforded the opportunity to modify our workflow and better meet the needs of

139

patients.

140

Clinical Outcomes

141

Over a four-week period (April 13 to May 8), 58 attending physicians from 3 specialties (internal

142

medicine, pediatrics, neurology; inclusive of 17 total subspecialties) requested support from 64

143

rising fourth-year medical students for 1411 total scheduled appointments (Figure 2). In the first

144

week (April 13 to 17), students serviced 173 (80.9%) of 214 total scheduled appointments and

145

transitioned 139 (80.3%) patient encounters to a Doxy.me video call. In the second week (April

146

20 to 24), students serviced 325 (87.1%) of 373 total scheduled appointments and transitioned

147

256 (78.8%) patient encounters to a Doxy.me video call. In the third week (April 27 to May 1),

148

students serviced 383 (87.4%) of 438 total scheduled appointments and transitioned 318 (83.0%)

149

patient encounters to a Doxy.me video call. In the fourth week (May 4 to 8), students serviced

150

337 (87.3%) of 386 total scheduled appointments and transitioned 281 (83.4%) patient

151

encounters to a Doxy.me video call.

152

We encountered several barriers (Figure 3A, B) to successful telehealth utilization during

153

our four-week pilot period. Together, 64 students were unable to initiate the patient encounter for

154

197 (13.9%) of 1411 total scheduled appointments. We identified two primary reasons: patients

155

either asked to reschedule (80, 41.5%) or simply did not answer the phone (79, 40.9%). Of the

156

1214 patient encounters that students were able to initiate, 992 (81.7%) were successfully

157

transitioned to a Doxy.me video call. Most patients from the remaining 222 encounters

158

specifically requested transition to a traditional phone call (101, 46.5%) or reported inability to

159

access a compatible smartphone and/or computer at the time (71, 32.7%). Despite assistance

160

from students, 40 (18.4%) patients were not adept enough with technology to enter the Doxy.me

161

virtual waiting room.

162

Limitations

163

Among the education outcomes, we note several limitations with uniformity. Attending

164

physicians were able to personalize their requests for student support, with some permitting

165

student participation during the actual patient encounters. Although all attending physicians were

166

asked to conduct debrief sessions when possible, time constraints and schedule conflicts reduced

167

the number of educational moments within this telehealth elective.

168

Among the measured clinical outcomes, data collected about barriers to telehealth

169

implementation are likely skewed. Our pilot was conducted while the RWJMG outpatient

170

practices existed in an unprecedented state of flux without their usual automated scheduling

171

systems in place. Instances where students were unable to initiate the patient encounter via phone

172

call were increasingly corrected towards the end of the pilot as these RWJMG systems were

173

reimplemented. Unfortunately, we were unable to follow up with these patients who were

174

rescheduled to ensure they eventually received care.

175

DISCUSSION

176

Despite the limitations presented, the outcomes of this pilot highlight a workflow that enables

177

students to meaningfully participate in patient care within the telehealth setting. Our efforts have

178

since expanded to include 100 rising second-year medical students. With these additional pre-

179

clinical participants, the telehealth elective has serviced over 2000 patients from the RWJMS

180

outpatient practices. As patient volumes stabilize in the outpatient clinics, the focus of the

181

elective will shift towards education through several modifications. For example, we plan to

182

increase the number of students assigned to each attending physician and schedule explicit

183

debrief sessions. This modification will maintain the practical aspects of the elective, increase

184

uniformity among student experiences, and guarantee educational moments. To ensure student

185

exposure to various patient populations, we will share our presented workflow with several

186

specialty clinics that have already expressed interest in conducting a similar telehealth elective.

187

We will continue to develop different and exciting modifications to bridge the return of learners

188

to the clinical space.

189

After a successful four-week pilot of our outpatient telehealth elective, we started

190

developing an inpatient telehealth initiative based on the Yale iCollaborative resources.3 This

191

initiative will allow medical students to contribute to inpatient care remotely as practices and

192

hospitals gradually reopen. The primary objective of this initiative is to introduce students to

193

telehealth encounters with patients where appropriate without risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2,

194

while additional objectives require students to participate in rounds and practice case

195

presentations, contribute to patient documentation, and act as patient liaisons after discharge to

196

ensure patients successfully connect with the next phases of their care. Successful integration of

197

this inpatient clinical curriculum will improve the capacity necessary for displaced students to

198

engage with patients, albeit through a different medium.

199

These objectives ultimately reflect the evolving demand for non-traditional digital

200

healthcare services in periods of both crises and normalcy. The American Medical Association

201

(AMA) recently published a playbook of telehealth workflows in support of recent national

202

policy changes to reduce unnecessary visits to healthcare settings and concomitant exposure risks

203

to the Coronavirus.4 The American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) further recognizes

204

the ability of telehealth to support longitudinal patient care models in their Core Entrustable

205

Professional Activities for Entering Residency.5 Together, these AMA and AAMC documents

206

establish a framework from which medical schools can build educational telehealth opportunities

207

into their curriculums.

208

With the development and implementation of these new telehealth initiatives, we hope to

209

expand the realm of possibility for clinical learning experiences in the virtual setting. These

210

novel educational experiences have the potential to make our clinical curriculum more resilient

211

during both this global pandemic and beyond.
