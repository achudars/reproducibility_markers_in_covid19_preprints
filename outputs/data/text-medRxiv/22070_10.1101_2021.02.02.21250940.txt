ABSTRACT

2

Complications affecting the lung are hallmarks of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

3

While there is evidence for autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact mechanisms remain

4

unknown. Here, we established a prospective observational cohort to study lung specific

5

autoantibodies (auto-Abs). Incubation of plasma from severe COVID-19 patients with healthy human

6

lung tissue revealed the presence of IgA antibodies binding to surfactant-producing pneumocytes.

7

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and protein pull-downs using porcine surfactant

8

confirmed the presence of auto-Abs binding to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Mass

9

spectrometry and ELISAs with recombinant proteins identified IgA auto-Abs that target human

10

surfactant proteins B and C. In line with these findings, lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients showed

11

reduced pulmonary surfactant. Our data suggest that IgA-driven autoimmunity against surfactant may

12

result in disease progression of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

2

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory

3

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic with grave

4

socio-economic implications that affects every country worldwide.1,2 To date more than 100 million

5

cases of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and over 2 million deaths have been reported across the globe.3

6

While age and comorbidities have been established as predictors for clinical outcome,4 there is a lack

7

of validated factors that precede disease progression. Particular susceptibility factors, such as HLA

8

haplotype,5 blood type,6 and genetic polymorphisms of SARS-CoV-2 target receptors including

9

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)7 have been proposed. Yet, they are not utilized in standard

10

clinical management of COVID-19.8

11

Recent publications highlight a potential role of autoimmunity associated with COVID-19 severity, as

12

many patients develop symptoms that resemble autoimmune diseases, such as antiphospholipid

13

syndrome (APS), rheumatoid arthritis, and myositis.9-11 Woodruff et al. have shown a surge of B-cell

14

responses that resemble those found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and further revealed that

15

high concentrations of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are associated with higher mortality.12

16

Bastard et al. reported that autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against the type I-interferons interferons (IFN)

17

α2 and IFN-ω inhibit the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, significantly increasing the

18

likelihood of disease progression.13 In line with these findings, an emerging report by Yang et al.

19

demonstrates that severely ill patients develop various auto-Abs against immunomodulatory proteins

20

that potentially perturb antiviral immune responses.14 Additionally, several studies have shown

21

significant elevations of APS-associated auto-Abs in severely ill patients, additionally explaining their

22

observed hypercoagulability and vascular inflammation.11,15 A further indication for the role of

23

autoimmunity is the significant reduction of mortality in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients

24

by administration of dexamethasone,16 and preventing deterioration of disease using tocilizumab.17

25

Consequently, immunosuppression with dexamethasone has been widely established as standard

26

treatment of severe illness18 and other immunosuppressive drugs, such as colchicine and cyclosporine,

27

show benefits in preliminary study data.19,20

1

While there is strong evidence for the role of autoimmunity in severe COVID-19, the exact

2

mechanisms have not been elucidated. Kanduc et al. have demonstrated amino acid sequence

3

similarities of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and human surfactant-related proteins,

4

suggesting a cross-reactivity of immune responses due to antigen mimicry.21 Additional investigations

5

reveal a higher rate of shared protein epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and the human proteome than

6

with other viruses, further supporting this finding.22,23 In a recent paper, Zuniga et al. have shown IgG

7

directed against annexin-2, a phospholipid-binding protein of the lung vasculature, is elevated in

8

severe COVID-19, indicating antibody cross-reactivity.24 While autoimmune antibodies with cross-

9

reactivity have been proposed, a lung cell specific target has not yet been shown.

10

Here, we present that severe COVID-19 is significantly associated with an IgA-driven autoimmune

11

response that targets surfactant proteins in type 2 pneumocytes. This may result in diminished

12

surfactant and, thus, could drive progression of disease severity. We established a prospective

13

observational study and collected plasma samples of COVID-19 patients with varying disease

14

severity. Using immunofluorescence, we observed IgA bound to pulmonary surfactant in plasma of

15

only severely ill COVID-19 patients. We then performed enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays

16

(ELISAs) coated with poractant alfa, a natural surfactant extracted from porcine pulmonary tissue,

17

which revealed significant binding of immunoglobulins (Ig). By mass spectrometry, we were able to

18

identify surfactant proteins as candidate autoantigens. This was confirmed by ELISAs using

19

recombinant human surfactant proteins. Lastly, immunofluorescence of lung tissue of deceased

20

COVID-19 patients showed diminished surfactant. To summarize our findings, we identified IgA

21

auto-Abs targeting surfactant proteins which demonstrate IgA-driven autoimmunity, likely

22

contribuing to compromised blood oxygenation. These data reveal an urgent need to explore the

23

preservation of surfactant proteins by immunosuppression and surfactant replacement in patients with

24

severe COVID-19.

RESULTS

2

Damaged lung tissue in COVID-19 shows autoimmune gene expression signatures

3

Most COVID-19 patients with fatal outcome develop diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), a life-threating

4

destructive lung disease that leads to disturbed pulmonary function with reduced gas exchange.25

5

Several pathologies, such as pulmonary edema, microthrombosis and fibrosis lead to respiratory

6

failure of patients with DAD. DAD from COVID-19 patients (COVID-19 DAD) show less

7

pronounced exudative changes and hemorrhages compared to non-COVID-19 DAD, as well as more

8

microthromboses, pulmonary thromboembolisms and

9

angiogenesis), indicating additional drivers of pathology.25-27 In addition, COVID-19 is characterized

10

by an exaggerated immune response in the lung.28 Thus, we hypothesized that the respiratory failure

11

of COVID-19 patients may be further aggravated by auto-Abs against self-antigens evoked by an

12

exaggerated immune activation. To understand if molecular pathways involved in autoimmunity are

13

present in lung tissue of severe COVID-19 patients (n=11), we performed gene expression analysis

14

with a panel specifically designed to analyze autoimmune disease (HTG EdgeSeq Immune Response

15

Panel). As a control group, we used patients with a DAD (n=10) caused by other reasons such as

16

drug-toxicity, lung surgery or myocardial infarction (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 1).

17

Unsupervised hierarchical clustering by k-means revealed clear grouping of COVID-19 patients and

18

non-COVID-19 patients in spite of both cohorts presenting with DAD (Fig. 1b). To explore, if

19

networks of autoimmune diseases are activated in COVID-19 patients, we performed gene set

20

enrichment analyses. To that end, we searched the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes

21

database (KEGG; https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) for autoimmune diseases and selected

22

“systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)” and “autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD)”. To date, these

23

autoimmune diseases are the only ones in KEGG that entail a substantial production of auto-Abs.

24

While both pathways showed significant expression enrichment in lung tissue of COVID-19 autopsy

25

samples (Fig. 1c), only the enrichment compared to SLE remained significant after false discovery

26

rate (fdr)-adjustment (SLE normalized enrichment score: 1.6, P=0.0008, fdr-adjusted P=0.02; vs.

27

ATD normalized enrichment score: 1.9, P=0.01, fdr-adjusted P=0.10). In conclusion, these data show

28

that networks of autoimmune disorders with the production of auto-Abs are enriched in COVID-19

Clinical study design

4

In order to identify auto-Abs in patients with COVID-19 we enrolled N=46 individuals in a

5

prospective monocentric observational study and collected plasma samples. The median age was 61

6

years (interquartile range 55-70 years), and 32 (70%) were male. Patient characteristics are provided

7

in Supplementary Table 2. Patients were divided into subgroups by COVID-19 severity based on

8

clinical criteria.29 In summary, we included 26 (57%) patients with critical, 13 (28%) with severe, and

9

7 (15%) with asymptomatic illness. For simplicity, patients with critical and severe disease will be

10

referred together as severe COVID-19. Additionally, we included plasma samples from healthy, non-

11

infected patients for control measurements. Details on patient recruitment are provided in the Methods

12

section.

13

14

Autoimmune antibodies are elevated in severe COVID-19

15

We assessed the presence of autoimmune-disease specific auto-Abs in COVID-19 patients and found

16

several auto-Abs that were elevated in individuals suffering from severe COVID-19 compared to

17

asymptomatic patients (Fig. 1d). Using the median antibody values of all cohorts, we calculated a

18

cumulative autoimmunity score (CAS). As expected, the CAS in severe COVID-19 patients was

19

significantly higher than in asymptomatic patients (P=0.02, two-tailed t-test, Figure 1e). In line with

20

the literature,14 our data showed elevated auto-Abs in severe COVID-19 compared to asymptomatic

21

patients, suggesting a vigorous auto-Abs response associated with disease severity.

22

23

Severe COVID-19 patients develop autoantibodies against proteins in type II pneumocytes

24

Given that we have detected autoimmune gene expression signatures, as well as auto-Abs, we next

25

determined the reactivity of auto-Abs in plasma samples from severe COVID-19 patients to any lung

26

protein using indirect immunofluorescence. Here, we inoculated plasma of severe COVID-19 patients

27

and healthy control patients with normal human alveolar lung tissue. We discovered specific binding

28

of IgA antibodies to distinguished areas of lung tissue (Fig. 2a). IgG were discoverable to a lesser

1

extent (Supplementary Fig. 1). Given that type II pneumocytes are the primary pulmonary target of

2

SARS-CoV-2,30 we assessed mRNA expression from various lung alveolar cells using previously

3

published data.31 This revealed a characteristically high gene expression of surfactant proteins C

4

(SFTPC), B (SFTPB), A1 and A2 in type II pneumocytes (Fig. 2b). To examine, whether COVID-19

5

patients showed IgA and IgG derived autoreactivity against surfactant-producing cells, we performed

6

immunofluorescence and co-stained for surfactant protein A as a surrogate marker for type II

7

pneumocytes. This showed strong co-localization of IgA and surfactant (Fig. 2c), and, to a lesser

8

extent, of IgG and surfactant (Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus, our data indicate that predominantly IgA

9

auto-Abs bind to surfactant proteins in severe COVID-19 patients.

10

11

IgA autoantibodies target surfactant protein B and C in patients with severe COVID-19

12

In order to identify the target surfactant protein, we performed ELISA coated with poractant alfa.

13

Poractant alfa is an extract of porcine lung surfactant that consists of various phospholipids and

14

phospholipid-binding proteins, and is used as an intratracheal rescue therapy for infants with acute

15

respiratory lung distress syndrome (ARDS).32 ELISA results showed a significant presence of IgA

16

(P=0.006, Mann-Whitney U test, Fig. 3a) and IgG (P=0.001, Supplementary Fig. 3) directed against

17

poractant alfa in the plasma of severe COVID-19 patients compared to asymptomatic disease. Next,

18

we identified protein components of poractant alfa using mass spectrometry, which confirmed the

19

presence of SFTPB and SFTPC (Fig. 3b). To identify putative antigens, we prepared pull-down

20

affinity columns: here we used pooled and immobilized Ig from severe COVID-19 patients (n=14)

21

and uninfected healthy controls (n=5), after their incubation with poractant alfa. The extract was

22

analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine the Ig-captured proteins. Interestingly, SFTPB was the

23

most abundant protein with high enrichment (≥10-fold) for captured proteins from plasma of severe

24

COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3c). Next, we used recombinant proteins of SFTPB and SFTPC to determine

25

the presence of autoreactive IgA and IgG in severe COVID-19 patients. The results showed a highly

26

significant difference of IgA against SFTPB (severe vs. asymptomatic, P=0.001, Mann-Whitney U

27

test) and for SFTPC (severe vs. asymptomatic, P=0.004) (Fig. 3d). Conversely, they showed no

28

significant difference for autoreactive IgG (Supplementary Fig. 4).

2

Surfactant is diminished in lungs of deceased COVID-19 patients

3

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells via their angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.33

4

By infecting alveolar type II epithelial cells, which are rich in ACE2 receptors on their surface,

5

SARS-CoV-2 directly influences the function and production of surfactant proteins.30 Our data of

6

auto-Abs against surfactant protein suggest an additional mechanism of surfactant disturbance. To

7

investigate, whether surfactant in lung tissue of COVID-19 patients is affected, we assessed its

8

presence in deceased COVID-19 patients with DAD and compared it to patients with non-COVID-19

9

DAD, and healthy controls. As suggested by previously reported gene expression analysis,34 the total

10

amount of surfactant was reduced in COVID-19 patients in comparison to non-COVID-DAD as well

11

as to healthy controls (Fig. 3e).

12

In summary, we identified novel IgA-driven autoimmune response against SFTPB and SFTPC in

13

severe COVID-19 patients, which is associated with diminished surfactant. Our data suggest that a

14

vigorous B-cell response against self-antigens can corrupt crucial components for alveolar gas

15

exchange, possibly explaining progression of COVID-19 to ARDS. We suggest further mechanistic

16

exploration of this hypothesis.

METHODS

2

Gene expression analysis:

3

Samples were included based on quality control criteria by the manufacturer (HTG Molecular

4

Diagnostics, Tucson, AZ). These require that the percentage of overall reads allocated to the positive

5

process control probe per sample is less than 28%, the read depth is at least 750000 and the relative

6

standard deviation of reads allocated to each probe within a sample is greater than 0.094. In addition,

7

only samples with a known postmortem interval were preserved for differential analysis. Differential

8

expression analysis was conducted in R version 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna,

9

Austria) with the DESeq2 package using default settings. Count estimates were normalized with the

10

median ratio method. Differential gene expressions for the contrast of COVID-19 patients with DAD

11

vs. control patients with other DAD were modelled with a negative binomial distribution and

12

subjected to a Wald significance test. Prior to heatmap visualization, the normalized counts were

13

further $log_2$ transformed using a robust variance stabilization. The heatmap of genes with a | log

14

fold change | > 1 was produced with the complexHeatmap package. Column sample clusters were

15

obtained by k-means clustering with k = 2 and row gene clusters by hierarchical clustering with

16

complete linkage. Functional analysis was quantified via gene set enrichment. All genes in the

17

autoimmune panel were pre-ranked using the Wald test statistic and submitted to the entire KEGG

18

database of human pathways using the clusterProfiler package.

Clinical study: patient recruitment, data and blood sample collection

21

Patient data and blood collection was approved by the Ethics committee of Eastern Switzerland (study

22

ID 2020-01006), and tissue collection by Ethics committee of Northern and Central Switzerland

23

(study ID 2020-00969). The studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki

24

guidelines.35 Collection of patient data and samples (serum or plasma) was conducted from April 9,

25

2020, to May 1, 2020 and tissue collection from March 13 2020 to May 4, 2020. SARS-CoV-2

26

infection of the severe COVID-19 cohort was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-

27

polymerase chain reaction36 of nasopharyngeal swab samples. Infection of asymptomatic COVID-19

28

was confirmed with serology of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, using two independent antibody tests: SGIT

after 3-4 weeks. All blood samples of severe COVID-19 patients were obtained within the first two

Plasma isolation from whole blood

10

Plasma samples were isolated from sodium-heparin whole blood (BD Vacutainer® CPT™ tubes,

11

Becton Dickinson, NJ). Briefly, the tubes were centrifuged at room temperature (RT) at 1650 g for 20

12

minutes at room temperature. The undiluted plasma was then aliquoted and stored at -80 °C for

13

subsequent analysis.

21

Autoantibodies against Cardiolipin, β-2-glycoprotein 1, double stranded DNA (dsDNA), cyclic

Indirect immunofluorescence

5

Four serial frozen sections from 4 lung tissues from patients without COVID-19 infection were

6

washed two times with PBS 0.1% Tween 20, for 5 min each. In a first step one section from each lung

7

tissue was then incubated for 30 minutes at RT with plasma from severe COVID-19 patients (plasma

8

pooled from three patients and diluted 1:3 in PBS), and another with serum from healthy donors

9

(pooled from three individuals, diluted 1:3 in PBS), and two slides with PBS only (negative controls).

10

After washing, one of the of the control slides was then incubated with sterile PBS for 30 min at room

11

temperature, while the remaining three slides were incubated with anti-IgA FITC (Dako, catalog no.

12

F0204; dilution 1:50) or anti-IgG FITC (Dako, catalog no. F0202; dilution 1:50) for 30 minutes at RT.

13

Slides were then counterstained with DAPI (ThermoFisher, catalog no. D1306) and mounted using

14

fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, catalog no. S3023). Slides were imaged and assessed using a

15

Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany).

16

17

Co-localization immunofluorescence staining

18

Fresh frozen lung tissues were incubated with the above described patients’ plasma pools diluted 1:3

19

for 30 min RT. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described.37-39 Briefly,

20

anti-surfactant (diluted 1:100 ab51891, Abcam), anti-IgA FITC and anti-IgG FITC primary antibodies

21

(diluted 1:50, respectively F0316-F0202 Dako) were used. Then, the incubation with the serum

22

secondary antibody alexa-fluor 647 (Invitrogen) was done. DAPI incubation for 10 minutes has been

23

performed to stain the nuclei. Samples were mounted in prolong gold anti-fade mounting medium

24

(Invitrogen) and scanned by confocal microscope (Ti2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Images were analyzed

25

using QuPath software40 as previously reported.37 Intensity fluorescence profile has been analyzed by

26

Nikon software to determine the co-localization of the signals as previously reported.38

SFTPB immunofluorescence staining

2

We compared the presence of SFTPB in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues obtained from

3

deceased patients with COVID-19 DAD, non-COVID-19 DAD and normal lungs as controls. Tissues

4

were processed as previously described for immunofluorescence staining.37-39 Briefly, antigen

5

retrieval was performed, and tissues incubated with PBS 0.1% Tween-20. Staining using anti-SFTPB

6

antibodies diluted 1:100 (NCL-SPPB) was done in blocking buffer for 1h at RT. Alexa-fluor 647

7

(Invitrogen) was applied as secondary antibody. Controls for secondary antibody specificity were

8

generated by substituting the primary antibody with blocking buffer only. All samples were incubated

9

with DAPI for 10 minutes and mounted in prolong gold anti-fade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and

10

scanned with the Ti2 confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

11

12

Single cell RNA data analysis

13

Single-cell RNA sequencing data of healthy lungs were obtained from the LungMap project31 via the

14

ToppCell portal (https://toppcell.cchmc.org/). Counts were normalized to log2-transcripts per million

15

(TPM) and compared across the 7 major epithelial cell types: type-1, and type-2 alveolar-, basal-,

16

ciliated-, club-, and goblet cells, as well as ionocytes. Housekeeping genes were excluded from the

17

analysis. Cell-specific genes were defined as those with overall expression log2-TPM > 5 and at least

18

4-fold higher expression in one or two particular cell types compared to all other cell types.

19

20

Immunoglobulin isolation from COVID-19 plasma samples

21

Plasma samples from 14 critical/severe COVID-19 patients and 5 asymptomatic patients were pooled

22

and immunoglobulins were isolated from 1 ml each of the plasma pools using 4 mL protein L coupled

23

agarose resin (Capto™ L, Cytiva Life Sciences, Amersham, UK) packed into 15 mL empty

24

polypropylene columns (Chromabond, Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany). After extensive washing

25

with PBS-T (0.05% Tween 20) the immunoglobulins were eluted in 0.1 M glycine buffer pH 2.5. 50

26

% of the isolated immunoglobulins from the pools were individually and chemically cross-linked onto

27

1 g of CNBr-activated sepharose (CNBr-activated Sepharose® 4B, Cytiva) as recommended by the

28

manufacturer and packed into 15 mL empty polypropylene columns (Chromabond, Machery-Nagel).

The protein content of 0.33 mL Curosurf® (poractant alfa, Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) was

2

immuno-purified after acetone precipitation in 15 mL of PBS-T per column by overnight binding at

3

4°C using a peristaltic pump (ISM597A, Ismatec, Wertheim, Germany) and a circuit flow rate of 0.5

4

mL/min, washing with 100 ml of PBS-T and elution in glycine buffer pH 2.5.

Protein identification by mass spectrometry

7

A SDS PAGE short gel purification was run with either acetone-precipitated 0.2 mL Curosurf® or the

8

immuno-purified and eluted proteins and in-gel digestion with Trypsin was conducted as described

9

previously.41 Extracted peptides were desalted using C18 StageTips42 and subjected to LC-MS/MS

10

analysis. LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on an Easy-nLC 1200 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher

11

Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled to an QExactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher

12

Scientific) as described elsewhere,43 or an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher

13

Scientific) as previously described.44 Peptides were eluted with a 60 min segmented gradient at a flow

14

rate of 200nl/min, selecting 20 most intensive peaks for fragmentation with HCD. The MS data was

15

processed with MaxQuant software suite v.1.6.7.045 to measure the iBAQ which was used to calculate

16

the relative protein level (riBAQ=iBAQ/(ΣiBAQ)). Database search was provided against pig

17

(121817 entries) and human (96817 entries) UniProt database using the Andromeda search engine.46

Fig. 2: a, Indirect Immunofluorescence of lung tissue shows that IgA antibodies are present in diffuse

18

alveolar damage of COVID-19 patients. b, RNA-seq expression of type II pneumocytes, the main

19

producer of surfactant, shows abundant overexpression of surface proteins C (SFTPC), B (SFTPB),

20

A1 (SFTPA1) and A2 (SFTPA2). c, Immunofluorescence staining of lung tissue with serum from

21

severely ill COVID-19 patients shows co-localization of IgA binding with surfactant. Co-localization

22

of IgA and the target protein is visualized in the right lower graph.

in plasma from severe COVID-19 (n=18) compared to asymptomatic patients (n=6; mean with 95%

26

CI, P=0.006). b, Mass spectrometry of poractant alfa lists abundance of surfactant binding proteins B

27

(SFTPB) and C (SFTPC). c, Pull-downs of poractant alfa reveal immunoglobulins binding to SFTPB
