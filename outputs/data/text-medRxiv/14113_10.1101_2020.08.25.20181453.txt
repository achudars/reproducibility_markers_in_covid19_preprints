Abstract:
Background:
Preliminary studies of COVID-19 have provided some evidence that electrolyte disturbances may also be
present in patients. In this study we aimed to evaluate the role of the arrival electrolytes and symptoms in
prediction of Lung damage in CT scan based on the CO-RADS system.
Methods:
This was a retrospective cross-sectional analytical study. We included patients with laboratory confirmed
COVID-19 infection, June 15 to July 7. Patients were included in study if there were no previous history
of kidney disease. Demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and CO-RADS Highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) of lung report were collected. Univariate logistic regression
was employed first to identify the effective, correlated items. All statistics were performed with SPSS
version 18.0.
Results:
In the current study, 36 (20 male- 16 female) patients with mean age of the 54.7±17.5 years old were
studied. Most common symptom at the arrival was the Fever (52.8%), followed by Fatigue (18%), and
dyspnea (44.4%). Computed tomography assessment revealed CO-RADS 2 in 4 (11.1%) patients, CORADS 3 in 1 (2.8%), CO-RADS 4 in 20 (55.6%), and CO-RADS 5 in 11 (30.6%) patients. In the
comparison with the study groups based on the HRCT status (CO-RADS II,III vs. CO-RADS IV,V),
patients with severe HRCT damage had significantly lower level of Phosphorus (P<0.01). Univariate
logistic regression analysis showed that only one factors was associated with HRCT damage status
(Phosphorus, P=0.040). Phosphorus upper than 4.5 was associated with better HRCT results with OR
ratio of 3.71 (X2(1)=5.69; p=0.017).
Conclusion:
Our study illustrates that higher phosphate levels may be associated with better CT scan of lung outcomes
in COVID-19; while hypophosphatemia is associated with severe lung injuries. This could help clinicians
to manage hospitalized patients and may link the COVID-19 and parathyroid gland.
Keywords: Hyperphosphatemia, Phosphate, Lung damage, COVID-19, parathyroid.

Introduction:
A new infectious disease, caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered in Wuhan, China in
December 2019. The rapid emergence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, to all around the world has
resulted in thousands of deaths worldwide. However, many infected patients show mild symptoms such
as the common cold and recover quickly, there are extremely increasing number of deaths due to COVID19. Preliminary case reports and cohort studies have described many clinical features of patients with
coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Preliminary studies of COVID-19 have provided some evidence that
electrolyte disturbances may also be present in patients, including sodium, potassium, chloride, and
calcium abnormalities (1,2). No specific treatment is currently available, and current management
includes supportive medical care (3). Electrolyte disturbances can have important implications not only
for patient management (4), but also for the identification of potential pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying COVID-19, which in turn can lead to new treatment opportunities. However, limited and
heterogeneous sample sizes can be seen in the report of electrolyte interpretation in studies to date.
Therefore, in order to compare the analysis in this study, we evaluate the electrolyte properties in the
initial trials of patients with confirmed COVID-19 (PCR) infection in Jahrom city of Iran and the
relationship with the involvement of patients in HRCT.
Method:
Study design:
This was a retrospective cross-sectional analytical study. We admitted patients with COVID-19 infection
who were transferred from clinics to designated hospitals for the treatment of specific infectious diseases
(June 15 to July 7). The study design of this study was approved by the ethics committee of Jahrom
University of Medical Sciences (code of IR.JUMS.REC.1398.130) and the written informed consent was
obtained from the patients due to the retrospective nature of the study. Inclusion criteria of study was
Patients who were referred to the hospital with positive PCR test for COVID-19, if there were no
previous history of kidney disease (due to possible effect on electrolytes). Exclusion criteria was Patient
dissatisfaction to participate in the stud.
Data collection:
At the patient arrival at emergency department of COVID-19 special ward, 5 cc blood was taken for
electrocytes analysis and blood sugar was assessed by glucometer. History and physical examination
taking was performed by physician. Demographic variables were also recorded. CO-RADS having 5
levels was the classification method used to address severity of lung injury in COVID-19 patients.
Category I of CO-RADS indicates a relatively small level of suspicion to COVID-19 pulmonary
involvement; category V of CO-RADS implies a very strong level of suspicion of COVID-19 pulmonary
involvement based on standard CT findings like ground-glass opacities (5). CT scan was performed at the
arrival of patients.
Statistical analysis:
Continuous variables are presented as the mean±standard derivation (SD), and a Student’s t-test was
used to determine whether there was a significant difference between the two groups based on the HRCT
results (Table 1). Continuous variables with significant differences were transformed into dummy
variables. To examine the effect of demographic factors on the HRCT lung damage, univariate logistic

regression was employed first to identify the effects, correlated items. All statistics were performed with
SPSS version 18.0, and the level of significance was set at P<0.05.
Results:
36 patients were evaluated in this study. There were 20 male and 16 female patients with a mean age of
54.7±17.5 years old. The most common symptom at the arrival was the Fever (52.8%), followed by
Fatigue (18%), and dyspnea (44.4%). Computed tomography Assessment Scheme revealed CO-RADS 2
in 4 (11.1%) patients, CO-RADS 3 in 1 (2.8%),CO-RADS 4 in 20 (55.6%), and CO-RADS 5 in 11
(30.6%) patients. In comparison with the study groups based on the HRCT status (mild, severe), patients
with severe HRCT damage had a significantly lower level of Phosphate (P<0.01, Table 1). Phosphate
was then transformed into a dummy variable (Table 2) and was used in the univariate logistic regression
analysis.

To carry out a univariate logistic regression analysis, HRCT damage status was set as the dependent
variable, and the independent variables consisted of 13 factors including Age, Gender, cough, dyspnea,
fatigue, body pain, headache, fever, chills, abdominal pain, gastroenteritis, eye redness, Phosphorus.
Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that only one factor was associated with HRCT damage
status (Phosphate, P=0.040). So, no further Multivariate analysis was conducted (table 2).

Figure 1. phosphate levels in each group of CO-RADS schemes

Discussion:
Our study revealed that higher phosphate levels may be associated with better CT scan of lung outcomes
in COVID-19; while hypophosphatemia is associated with severe lung injuries. To our knowledge, it’s
the first report of COVID-19 patients showing the possible protective effect of phosphate level of serum
on lung injury caused by SARS-COV2 virus. There are some previous studies showing possible role of
the hypophosphatemia in severity of disease. Kormann et al. (6) study evaluating 42 laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 patients, compared phosphate serum levels of patients admitted in ICU versus other
patients admitted in medical department wards. Their result didn’t reveal any significant difference
between the Baseline serum phosphate of these groups of patients. There were Hyperphosphataemia was
just seen in 2 (5%) patients who were admitted in ICU while no patient in the medical department had

hypophosphatemia. But in our study, there were 4 patients with Hyperphosphataemia among severely
damaged lungs and 5 subjects among mild HRCT lung damage group. On the other hand, 7 patients had
hypophosphatemia in our study and all were experiencing severe lung injury. Arenas et al. (7) study
showed hypophosphatemia in renal patients with confirmed COVID-19 in comparison of renal patients
who were negative for the COVID-19 PCR test. Our study is in contrast with Arenas et al. as we observed
a wide range of serum phosphate levels in our patients with a reasonable association with HRCT results.
They suggested hypophosphatemia as a potential risk factor of COVID-19; while it could be a reflection
of malnutrition. But in our study phosphate levels were assessed in the association of COVID-19 severity
and comparison of our results would not be possible as also their study sample were renal patients. As we
know renal patients may show severe alternations in phosphate levels due to renal diseases and
hemodialysis processes. On other hand hyperphosphatemia due to kidney inability of phosphate excretion
is frequent in renal patients (8) and the hypothesis of Arenas et al. for hypophosphatemia association with
COVID-19 make sense, as we expect up to 90% of renal patients to experience hyperphosphatemia (9),
but further shreds of evidence are needed. Another study showed normal ranges of phosphate in 14,712
COVID-19 patients, with no differences among male and female cases (10). While their data was
collected from multiple centers medical recorders through the TriNetX network and no information was
addressed about the time of the laboratory analysis, their results may be biased by the different time point
of laboratory results recording based on the patient course of the disease. But we assessed laboratory
results at the arrival of patient to the Emergency department.
Phosphorus is one of the most important ions inside and outside the cell due to its role in physiological
processes, especially muscle contraction and adenosine triphosphate production (11). Therefore,
hypophosphatemia is one of the most important electrolyte disorders in special wards (12). The main
causes of hypophosphatemia are diffuse infection, trauma, receiving volumetric agents, malnutrition
syndrome, acid and base disorder, and some drugs, as well as conditions such as major surgery,
hypoglycemia, and osmotic diuresis, parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy, and malnutrition. (13). This
complication is very important in patients under mechanical ventilation due to the effect of
hypophosphatemia on muscle contraction (14); Weak muscle contraction leads to increased duration of
mechanical ventilation and difficulty separating (15).
On the other hand, the findings of this study may be in line with researches looking for vitamin D benefits
for COVID-19 patients. Calcitriol is the biologically active form of vitamin D, which is the main
hormone that regulates calcium and phosphorus metabolism, and its blood concentration is strongly
regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus.
Conclusion:
This study facing various limitations like doesn’t have a follow up for the patient treatment outcome and a
low number of samples is showing that higher serum levels of phosphate are associated with milder
involvement of lung in COVID-19 patients. The strength of this study is suggesting possible benefits of
hyperphosphatemia for COVID-19 patients. But these results may have been biased by other confounding
factors that weren’t assessed in our study as well as malnutrition. So further studies are needed in this area
of research.
