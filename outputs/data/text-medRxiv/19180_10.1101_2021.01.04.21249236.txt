While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and
mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we
examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient
demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was
significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing
levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a
predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and
cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were
associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva
viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such
as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva
viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and
effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load
showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in
COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated
with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels.
Together these results demonstrated that viral load – as measured by saliva but not
nasopharyngeal — is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and
mortality over time.
COVID-19 is a disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, which results in a heterogenous

presentation of symptoms and severity. While most cases of COVID-19 are asymptomatic and

mild, the full spectrum of disease includes more serious infections ranging from moderate to

severe, requiring increasing levels of medical intervention, and may ultimately prove fatal.

Though patients with severe disease have been reported in all spectrums of age and health,

males, older patients, and those with specific underlying medical conditions are associated with

associated with an even greater risk of severe disease

Clinically, severe COVID-19 is characterized by the induction of a strong inflammatory immune

response, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies

that progress to death have been shown to express higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and

have revealed the benefit of cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses for improved

, as well as the reduction in follicular CD4 T cell subsets needed for the

development and maturation of high-quality antibodies

. Despite these associations, to date

no factor has been described that can significantly distinguish the full spectrum of severity in

COVID-19, from mild to fatal manifestations of disease as well as unify the many cellular,

immunological, clinical, and demographic parameters seen in the spectrum of disease severity.

disease, other studies have not found these associations

have been positively associated with age

. Given the associations that nasopharyngeal viral

load has on specific aspects of COVID-19 disease, our work sought to study the associations that

saliva viral load had on important parameters of COVID-19 including the association with known

risk factors, and hallmark disease phenotypes such as strong cytokine induction, lymphopenia,

and its association with immature humoral immune responses.

Summary of Cohort Composition
One hundred and fifty four patients admitted to Yale-New Haven hospital between March and

8

June of 2020 were used for analysis as part of our ongoing longitudinal IMPACT study . We

assessed nasopharyngeal and saliva viral RNA load quantified by RT-qPCR, as well as levels of

plasma cytokines, chemokines and antibodies. Leukocyte profiles were obtained from freshly

isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, clinical data was obtained

from patient healthcare records and were matched to collection timepoints within a maximum

of 48 hours difference from the date of saliva or nasopharyngeal sample collection. Our cohort

was comprised of different subgroups categorized by gradations of disease severity including 62

hospitalized patients who developed severe disease and were admitted to the ICU during their

hospital stay, and 84 hospitalized patients with moderate disease symptoms. A total of 23

patients with COVID-19 died during the time of our study. A separate cohort of individuals not

hospitalized

for

COVID-19,

called

“non-hospitalized”

consisted

of

workers who were being serially monitored for infection and who became RT-qPCR positive by

these groups included 18 RT-qPCR positive healthcare workers who were not hospitalized for

symptoms and 8 RT-qPCR positive patients who were not hospitalized for COVID-19. Finally,

108 uninfected healthcare workers served as a control group. A comprehensive demographic

breakdown of the cohort is provided in Extended Data Table 1. A total of 355 samples were

collected from the infected cohort, which included 1-8 collection timepoints from participants

spanning from 2 days before until 40 days after the onset of symptoms. To gain a better

understanding of the relationship between viral load and the parameters measured, individuals

with

viral

loads

were

stratified

into

three

groups

based

on

the

quantile

distribution of viral load levels across the entire cohort, as low (saliva viral load=3.212-4.4031

Log10 [Log](GE/ml)), medium (saliva viral load=4.4031-6.1106 Log (GE/ml)), and high (saliva viral
load=6.1106-10.320 Log (GE/ml)), irrespective of disease severity for all timepoints collected.

Our threshold viral load limit of detection was 3.22 Log (GE/ml) labeled in this study as viral

load limit of detection (VLD), and our threshold limit of positivity, labeled as viral load limit of

positivity (VLP) was 3.75 Log (GE/ml).

First-recorded saliva viral load associates with COVID-19 risk factors
Male sex, older age, and specific respiratory, cardiovascular, oncological, and other systemic

and immune-suppressive conditions are associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19

1-4

. To

assess if viral load may be linked with these risk factors, we analyzed first-recorded saliva and

nasopharyngeal viral load levels against patient demographics known to be associated with

worse

outcomes.

Samples

collected

within

two

weeks

following

the

administration

of

convalescent serum were excluded from this analysis. Patients were categorized based on the

presence or absence of a particular COVID-19 health risk factor (Extended Table 1), which

included

chronic

respiratory

conditions

(e.g., COPD

and asthma),

as well

as

cardiovascular

disease, hypertension, cancer within one year of infection, and other conditions that lead to

immunosuppression including HIV infection, type II diabetes, cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease,

or being actively treated with a drug known to cause immunosuppression. Saliva viral load was

significantly higher in patients who were found to have any of these five categorical health risk

factors (Extended Figure 1). To assess if these effects were additive, given that individuals with

4

multiple health risk factors are associated with a higher risk of severe disease , patients were

then stratified into five categories representing their summative risk factors from 0 to 4+. These

categories demonstrated a significant increasing positive trend of disease severity and mortality

increasing measurements of saliva viral load in which patients with four or more risk factors

had significantly higher saliva viral loads than those with zero, or one, or two risk factors upon

first sample collection (Figure 1a). Age also showed a significant positive correlation with saliva

viral load (Figure 1b) and comparison of viral load between sex demonstrated that saliva viral

load

was

significantly

higher

in

male

than

in

female

patients

(Figure

1c).

By

contrast

nasopharyngeal viral load was not statistically significantly related to any of these parameters

that were measured (Figure 1d, e, f and Extended Figure 1 f-j). These results suggest that risk

factors for COVID-19 may be reflective of an underlying replicative capacity of the virus found in

the saliva of these individuals from the first collection that appears additive and is associated

with an increased likelihood of severity and mortality.

Early saliva viral load correlates with a spectrum of disease severity and mortality
We then sought to compare viral load with respect to the spectrum of disease severity in our

cohort. To do so, we first compared viral load measurements between hospitalized and non-

hospitalized individuals (described above) using only first-recorded viral load within the first ten

days

disease.

Hospitalized

patients demonstrated significantly higher saliva viral loads than non-hospitalized individuals

(Figure 2a). Comparison of first recorded saliva viral loads for hospitalized patients between

moderate and severe disease and alive and deceased individuals throughout the course of

disease revealed that saliva viral load was progressively and significantly higher in patients with

worse outcomes (Figure 2b, c).

To gain a better sense of how this played out throughout the course of disease we tracked

saliva viral load levels over days from symptom onset. This revealed distinct viral load kinetics

across all severity groups, with those with more severe disease initiating with or maintaining

higher viral load levels throughout the course of disease (Figure 2g). Measurement of overall

saliva viral load levels over time revealed that there were significant differences across all

severity groups with viral load levels increasing significantly from non-hospitalized individuals,

to moderate, severe, and finally deceased individuals (Figure 2h). Surviving patients showed a

from symptom onset could predict the full spectrum of severity. Saliva viral load with days from

Given the strong associations of saliva viral load over nasopharyngeal viral load with many of

the immunological factors associated with increased disease severity and mortality, we sought

to identify the most influential predictors of saliva viral load by running a non-linear iterative

partial least squares (NIPALS) analysis of all factors and then assessing for variable importance.

and

CXCR3, was identified as the most important positive correlate of higher saliva viral load. In

close second through fourth were additional chemokines and mitogens including CCL8, CXCL9,

and SCF. Other positive VIP correlates once again included inflammatory and inflammasome

α, IL-18, IL-1ra, IL-1α and IL-1β), cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, IL-15), chemokines (CXCL9,

cytokines (TNF

CCL3, CCL2), types I-III interferons, as well as additional Th1 and Th17 cytokines such as IL-2, IL-

12p40, and IL-17a. CXCL13, a chemokine for Tfh and germinal center B cells expressing CXCR5,

was also found to be a positive predictor of higher saliva viral loads.

The most important negative correlates of saliva viral load were found to be anti-RBD IgG,

platelets, and anti-S IgG (Figure 3b), suggesting an important role for

against

viral

replication.

Platelets

and

CXCL5—were

factors

8

.

Comparing these VIP correlates between low medium and high viral load, we found that they

followed either progressive decline or increase, depending on whether they were predictors of

low or high viral load, respectively (Figure 3c, and Extended Figure 3b and 4). To better visualize

how each of these positive and negative parameters of saliva viral load behaved within our

cohort,

a

heatmap

was

constructed

using

these

39

VIP

predictors

of

saliva

viral

load.

Hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct patient clusters (cluster 1, and 2; Figure 3d) and

two distinct clusters of cellular factors (A, B; Figure 3d). Patients in cluster 1 showed a strong

enrichment of factors in cluster A, which were all of the VIP correlates associated with low

saliva viral load, while patients in cluster 2 showed strong enrichment of factors in cluster B,

which were positive predictors of high saliva viral load. Indeed, patients in cluster 2 showed

significantly higher saliva viral loads, were significantly older, and showed significantly higher

rates of severity and mortality (Figure 3e). These findings suggest that the pro-inflammatory

signature seen in severe COVID-19 may be driven by higher viral loads. Further, they reveal an

immunological blueprint associated with lower viral loads, decreased severity, and mortality.

Saliva viral load is strongly associated with the progressive depletion of lymphocytes
One of the hallmarks of COVID-19 is T lymphopenia. We therefore investigated the association

of viral load to the amount of T cells and other cell subsets found in patient PBMC samples. As

previously described for other types of viral load

33

, saliva viral load was significantly negatively

associated with absolute lymphocyte counts obtained from patient clinical data, as well as total

T cells counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Extended Figure 3c). Additionally, saliva viral load was

negatively associated with many effector T cell subsets, NK, and NKT cells, macrophages, and

some B cell subsets (Extended Figure 3c). In contrast, nasopharyngeal viral load also showed

some but fewer significant negative correlation to some of these lymphocyte subsets (Extended

Figure 3c).

Comparison of lymphocyte subset counts to uninfected healthcare workers and individuals with

low, medium, and high saliva viral load levels showed that individuals with high saliva viral load

had significantly lower total T cell counts compared to uninfected healthcare workers and those

in the low saliva viral load group (Figure 3f, g). These associations held even after accounting for

age-related T cell decline (Extended Table 3). Similar observations were seen for CD4 and CD8 T

cells and effector subsets including lower counts for CD4 Tfh and follicular CD8 T cells as well as

lower counts for HLADR+/ CD38+ activated CD4 and CD8 T cells with higher saliva viral loads

(Figure 3g, and Extended Figure 5a). Furthermore, patients in the high saliva viral load group

exhibited significant reduction of NK cell, NKT cell counts over uninfected healthcare workers

(Extended Fig. 5A). Similar effects were seen with nasopharyngeal viral load levels but not for

all subsets including T cells when ranked by viral load (Extended Figure 5b).

Given the important relationship between days from symptom onset to viral load, we evaluated

the relationship of saliva viral load to T cell counts over the course of disease. Saliva viral load,

and days from symptom onset showed a significant contribution to the changes in T cell counts

over time (Adj R=0.957, p=0.0032) (Figure 3i and Extended Table 3). These strong negative

associations between saliva viral load over days from symptom onset extended to CD4 and CD8

T

cells

and

effector

subsets

including

circulating

CD4

Tfh

cells

(Adj

R=0.961,

(Extended Table 3). Nasopharyngeal viral load also showed some of these associations, though

to a limited set of cells (Extended Table 3)

Generating highly specific anti-RBD IgG, the most important negative correlate of saliva viral

load that we measured, requires the coordinated efforts of germinal center B cells as well as

Tfh cells for antibody affinity maturation. Given the strong negative association that saliva viral

load has on the numbers of circulating lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets including CD4 Tfh

cells, an assessment of the lymphocyte repertoire in deceased patients was conducted. This

analysis revealed that deceased patients indeed exhibited significant depletion of circulating

lymphocytes and T cell subsets including CD4 Tfh cells (Figure 3h and Extended Figure 5c).

Early escape from high saliva viral load is associated with better antibody production and
recovery
Anti-RBD IgG and anti-S IgG levels were among the most important negative correlates of low

saliva viral load. Comparison of antibody levels between uninfected healthcare workers and

those in the high medium and low saliva viral load levels demonstrated that patients with

medium and low saliva viral load had significantly higher anti-RBD and anti-S IgG than those in

Patients who stayed in the high saliva viral load level showed an initial delay in the production

of antibody compared to those in the lower saliva viral load levels with a significant difference

between days 10-20 from symptom onset, before eventually catching up to those who were in,

or had managed to enter into the lower viral load levels (Figure 4b, e). Notably, this statistically

significant difference in antibody production between days 10-20 from symptom onset was also

seen in deceased individuals (Figure 4 c, f), which coincided with increased depletion of cCD4

Tfh cells during this time period (Extended Figure 4a).

To better understand how antibody levels correlated with saliva viral load kinetics and disease

severity in our cohort, the mean duration of time spent in the high, medium, and low saliva viral

load brackets was compared amongst the spectrum of disease severity along with antibody

levels

and

the

overall

ratio

of

antibody

to

levels.

Interestingly,

patients exhibited significantly longer time spent in the high saliva viral load bracket than

significantly shorter time (less than 5 days) in the high viral load bracket than hospitalized

patients (Figure 4g). While antibody levels did not vary significantly across the cohort in the

high viral load bracket, the overall ratio of antibody to saliva viral load was uniformly low

(Figure 4h). Notably the vast majority of patients who survived exited the high saliva viral load

bracket by day 14 from symptom onset, which accounted for one standard deviation from the

mean for both moderate and deceased individuals in the high saliva viral load group and fell

within the significant window of antibody production described in Figure 4b. Furthermore, with

the exception of two individuals in the medium viral load level, deceased patients failed to exit

the high saliva viral load bracket (Figure 4g-j). Observation of individual trajectories for saliva

viral load and antibody production, showed that saliva viral load decreased as overall antibody

to

viral

load

ratio

within

an

individual

(Extended

Figure

6c).

Notably,

antiviral

antibody to saliva viral load ratios in the medium and low viral load brackets showed a steady

increase amongst the severity groups, with higher antibody and antibody to viral load ratios

seen with increasing disease severity and lower viral load respectively (Fig 4j), as well as a

growing separation between anti-S1 IgG and anti-RBD IgG that increased with disease severity

and the mean days from symptom onset (Figure 4g, h). Indeed, patients with severe disease

who successfully made it into the low viral load group did so at significantly more days from

symptom

onset

than

moderate

or

non-hospitalized

individuals.

In

addition,

they

displayed

significantly higher anti-S1 IgG levels than the lower severity groups (Figure 4h). Furthermore,

higher proportional levels of anti-S1 IgG over anti-RBD IgG in the low saliva viral load group

showed a significant positive interaction with increased disease severity, with Non-Hospitalized

individuals showing a non-significant difference between their anti-RBD IgG and anti-S1 IgG

levels,

those

with

disease

showing

ratios to escape the high and medium saliva viral load bracket and effectively overcome their

viral burden. Second, while anti-RBD IgG was significantly more effective at bringing down

saliva viral load (Extended Figure 6b), increased disease severity required broader anti-S1 IgG to

overcome their viral burden (Figure 4j, which may further delay their overall rate of recovery.

Given that higher viral loads are associated with depletion of cCD4 Tfh cells, these results

suggest that lethal COVID-19 disease may be a feature of high early stage saliva viral load,

reduction in Tfh and antibody responses, leading to the failure to clear the virus, and triggering

a vicious circle. Indeed, maintaining high viral load for longer showed significantly divergent

trajectories toward increasing severity of illness and death (Fig. 4k).

amongst different collection sites

not equivalent measures of disease processes for COVID-19. Correlation between these two

sites showed an R=0.61 (p<0.0001) and saliva and nasopharyngeal viral load shared a related

Saliva

with

increasing disease severity and demonstrated distinct viral load kinetics across the severity

spectrum from non-hospitalized to deceased individuals. Saliva viral load could significantly

predict disease severity and mortality over age or nasopharyngeal viral load with the first

sample collection, and, importantly, was enhanced with the inclusion of days from symptom

onset. Nasopharyngeal viral load could not reliably distinguish severity or predict mortality in

which may further predispose those with pre-existing conditions to higher viral replication.

Thirty-nine VIP factors were significantly associated with saliva viral load, including 30 factors

associated with higher saliva viral load, which included Type I-III IFNs, inflammasome factors,

cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL13; and 9 associated with lower viral loads. These two

signatures associated with high and low saliva viral load clustered separately from one another

six factors (Eotaxin 2, PDGF ABA/BB, PDGFAA, EGF, sCD40L, and CXCL5) previously associated

with recovery in our cohort

, showed significantly lower rates of disease severity and mortality.

Many of these lower viral load factors are released by platelets which also showed a significant

predictive

ability

for

lower

saliva

viral

loads.

This

phenomenon

may

be

related

to

the

thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies seen in patients with severe disease that is reflected

through saliva viral load and further integrates saliva viral load as an important measure of the

disease phenotypes seen in COVID-19. These results provide an immunological blueprint that

reflects better protection against viral replication; a path that may be inefficiently achieved in

those who start with higher viral loads and produce higher inflammatory signatures.

Patients within the higher initial viral load bracket required higher concentrations of antibody

and higher antibody-to-viral-load ratios to successfully escape the high viral load bracket. While

anti-RBD IgG is more effective at bringing down viral load, increased

disease severity was

associated with higher reliance on less specific anti-S1 IgG to overcome their viral load burden,

which may further delay their overall rate of recovery. Indeed, patients with severe disease

took significantly longer days from symptom onset than those with moderate disease or non-

hospitalized individuals to achieve low saliva viral loads. Given that higher saliva viral loads are

associated

with

increased

depletion

of

CD4

cTfh

cells,

these

results

suggested

that

this

increased reliance on anti-S1 IgG may be driven from the lack of proper B cell help, as a result

of lymphocyte depletion among this cohort.

In this same vein, patients with fatal COVID-19 showed significantly lower lymphocytes and

lymphocyte subsets including CD4 cTfh cells than patients who survived. Like individuals with

high saliva viral load, deceased patients exhibited significantly lower anti-RBD and anti-S1 IgG in

days 10-20 from symptom onset, which corresponded with a significantly more pronounced

depletion of cTfh cells in that time frame. This significant delay in antibody production may

indeed have been the final determinant of their overall fate, for not only would they have to

catch up in the production of antibody, but they would have to produce much more antibody

than those with lower viral loads to effectively overcome their viral load burden and exit the

high saliva viral

load bracket. Concordantly, while most patients who

survived successfully

escaped the high saliva viral load bracket by day 14 from symptom onset, deceased individuals

failed to do so showing low overall antibody to viral load ratios, and those that did manage to

escape at later days showed signs of requiring much higher antibody levels to do so with a

stronger reliance on anti S1 IgG. Hence, lethal COVID-19 disease may be a feature of high early

stage saliva viral load, reduction in Tfh and antibody responses, leading to the failure to clear

to

reducing viral load early before severe depletion of effector cell populations in days 10-20 from

this

may

be

related

to

the

inability of these drugs to successfully bring down viral burden at the early stage of disease

. It is also important to note that those who have higher viral loads required a higher

antibody-to-virus ratio to successfully bring down viral load and anti-RBD IgG was better at

accomplishing

this.

These

are

important

when

of

convalescent serum in individuals which may harbor varying levels of specific antibody and may

successfully or unsuccessfully bring down viral loads to an appropriate ratio based on initial

others that target viral load to ensure efficacy.

In summary our work revealed both the important role that saliva viral load has as a clinical

measure of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 as well the importance of viral load as an

integral component of the spectrums of disease severity and clinical pathology that should be

monitored early. We identified novel factors associated with lower and higher viral loads that

One hundred and nine uninfected healthcare workers were

used in this study as a control group. Age and sex were obtained from standardized survey

data. Healthcare workers were serially monitored for infection using RT-qPCR screening from

either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples. Eighteen healthcare workers who became RT-q-PCR

positive for SARS-CoV-2 but did not require hospitalization for symptoms were included in this

study as part of the non-hospitalized group. Days from symptom onset were determined from a

standardized survey provided to healthcare workers throughout enrollment in the study, or by

interview.

. Briefly, same-day blood collection and processing was done from whole blood

samples collected in sodium heparin-coated vacutainers that were gently agitated until the

samples were processed. To isolate serum from blood samples, vacutainers were centrifuged at

400g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) with no brake. The resulting undiluted serum was

aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for later analysis. For PBMC isolation, resulting concentrated

blood after serum isolation was processed at room temperature, first by diluting the sample in

a 1:1 ratio with PBS. And then by density gradient centrifugation using 50 ml SepMate tubes

(StemCell Technologies; #85460) in which Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich, #10771-500ML) had been

added to the appropriate volume according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were

into a new sterile 50ml conical tube and washed twice with PBS, treated with ACK lysis buffer

for 2 min and washed again before counting and assessing cell viability using standard Trypan

blue staining and an automated cell counter (Thermo-Fisher, #AMQAX1000). All samples were

(1:300) (BioLegend). Briefly, freshly isolated PBMCs were plated at 1–2 × 10

cells per well in a

96-well U-bottom plate. Cells were resuspended in Live/Dead Fixable Aqua (ThermoFisher) for

20 min at 4 °C. After a wash, cells were treated with Human TruStan FcX (BioLegend) for 10 min

at RT for blocking. Antibody cocktails were added directly to this mixture for 30 min at RT. For

secondary stains, cells were washed and the supernatant was aspirated leaving a cell pellet.

Then secondary cocktail of markers was added to the cell pellets for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were

resuspended in 100 μl 4% PFA for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed prior to data collection on an

Attune NXT (ThermoFisher). FlowJo software version 10.6 (tree Star) was used for data analysis.

The specific sets of markers used to identify each subset of cells are provided in Extended

Panels represent the frequency of individuals within each severity group that fall into the high,

f,

medium, and low nasopharyngeal viral load categories before day 14 from symptom onset
(bottom left) and at or after day 14 from symptom onset (top left).

g,

Subpanels show the

prevalence of deceased individuals within the high, medium, and low nasopharyngeal viral load
categories before day 14 (bottom) and on or after day 14 (top).

Panels show mean levels of

Anti S1 IgG and Anti RBD IgG (top) and their ratios over nasopharyngeal viral load (bottom),
amongst severity groups in the high medium and low nasopharyngeal viral load levels. X-axis

d

denotes nasopharyngeal viral load levels as well as mean days from symptom onset (DfSO) of
each severity group within each viral load level as determined in

. Comparisons of means

amongst severity groups is made in the low nasopharyngeal viral load level via least squares
mean analysis using REML to compare Anti S1 IgG and Anti RBD levels between the groups and
within groups. P values are adjusted for multiple comparisons using Sidak correction.

Extended Data Table 1: Cohort composition
Chi-Squared Tests for significance use Poisson rates. COVID-19 Risk factors for
Immunosuppression include patients with HIV, type-2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease,
cirrhosis, and patients on a known immunosuppressive agent prior to admission.
