Abstract
The effective reproduction number Reff is a critical epidemiological parameter that characterizes the
transmissibility of a pathogen. However, this parameter is difficult to estimate in the presence of
silent transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This variation can occur
due to the lack of timely or appropriate testing, public health interventions and/or changes in human
behavior during an epidemic. This is exactly the situation we are confronted with during this
COVID-19 pandemic.
In this work, we propose to estimate Reff for the SARS-CoV-2 (the etiological agent of the COVID19), based on a model of its propagation considering a time-varying transmission rate. This rate is
modeled by a Brownian diffusion process embedded in a stochastic model. The model is then fitted
by Bayesian inference (particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method) using multiple well-documented
hospital datasets from several regions in France and in Ireland. This mechanistic modeling
framework enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the transmission rate of the COVID-19
based only on the available data. Except for the specific model structure, it is non-specifically
assumed that the transmission rate follows a basic stochastic process constrained by the observations.
This approach allows us to follow both the course of the COVID-19 epidemic and the temporal
evolution of its Reff(t). Besides, it allows to assess and to interpret the evolution of transmission with
respect to the mitigation strategies implemented to control the epidemic waves in France and in
Ireland. We thus can estimate a reduction of more than 80% for the first wave in all the studied
regions but a smaller reduction for the second wave when the epidemic was less active. For the third
wave in Ireland the reduction was again significant (>70%).

transmissibility. It measures how many additional people can be infected by an infected individual
during the course of an epidemic. However, Reff is difficult to estimate in the presence of silent
transmission and/or significant temporal variation in case reporting. This is exactly the situation we
are confronted with during this COVID-19 pandemic.
The statistical methods classically used for the estimation of Reff have some shortcomings in the
rigorous consideration of the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We propose here to use
an original approach based on a stochastic model whose parameters vary in time and are inferred in a
Bayesian framework from reliable hospital data. This enables us to reconstruct both the COVID-19
epidemic and its Reff. The Reff time evolution allows us to get information regarding the potential
effects of mitigation measures taken during and between epidemics waves.
This approach, based on a stochastic model that realistically describes the hospital multiple datasets
and which overcomes many of the biases associated with Reff estimates, appears to have some
advantage over previously developed methods.

Introduction
In the last months of 2019, clustered pneumonia cases were described in China [1]. The etiological
agent of this new disease, a betacoronavirus, was identified in January and named SARS-CoV2. This
new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly worldwide, causing millions of cases, killing
hundreds of thousands of people and causing socio-economic damage. Until vaccination campaigns
are widely implemented, the expansion of COVID-19 with the occurrence of new and more
transmissible variants continues to threaten overwhelming the healthcare systems of many countries,
despite a wide range of public health strategies using different non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPI).
In the early stages of each new epidemic, one of the first steps to design a control strategy is to
estimate pathogen transmissibility in order to provide information on its potential to spread in the
population. This is crucial to understand the likely trajectory of the new epidemic and the level of
intervention that is needed to control it. Among the various indicators that quantify this
transmissibility, the most commonly used is the reproduction number, which measures how many
new infected individuals on average can be generated by one infected individual. In the initial phase
of the epidemic, when the entire population is susceptible, this quantity is referred to as R0, the basic
reproduction number, and is defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by one
infected individual in an entirely susceptible population [2-3]. As the epidemic develops and the
number of infected individuals increases (and the number of susceptible individuals decreases), the
effective reproduction number Reff, characterizing the transmission potential according to the
immunological state of the host population, is used instead. It can be estimated as a function of time,
the instantaneous effective reproduction number Reff(t) quantifying the number of secondary
infections caused by an infected person at a specific time-point of an epidemic. The epidemic is able
to spread when Reff(t)>1 and is under control when Reff(t)<1. Reff(t) can be used to monitor changes in
transmission in near real time and, as a consequence, for instance, of control or mitigation measures.

Classically, Reff(t) is estimated by the ratio of the number of new infections generated at time t to the
total infectiousness of individuals in the infected state at time t. This latter quantity is defined based
on the generation time distribution (the time between infection and transmission) or on the serial
interval (the time between the onset of symptoms of a primary case and the onset of symptoms of
secondary cases) [4-5].
For the COVID-19 epidemic, considering the data needed for the estimation of the reproductive
numbers, caution is urged when interpreting the values obtained and the short-term fluctuations in
these estimates due to both data quality, which must be taken into account [6-9]. In a recent study by
O'Driscoll et al [6], it was concluded, comparing different methods, that there are many important
biases in the Reff(t) estimates and that this can easily lead to erroneous conclusions about changes in
transmissibility during an epidemic. These biases are mainly due to the uncertainty in incidence data
that can arise due to both the transmission characteristics of this virus (asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission) and the quality and preparedness of the public health system. For
COVID-19, it has been shown that the number of observed confirmed cases significantly
underestimates the actual number of infections [10-11]. For instance, during the initial rapid growth
phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number of confirmed case underestimated the actual number
of infections by 50 to 100 times [10]. In France, it has been estimated that the detection rate increased
from 7% in mid-May to 40% by the end of June, compared to well below 5% at the beginning of the
epidemic [12]. In addition, these biases can be amplified by the combination of the high proportion of
asymptomatic cases [13] with low health-seeking behaviors. Although the estimation of the
reproductive number is robust to underreporting [14], this is only true if the reporting rate (among
other characteristics) is constant over the observation period. This was not verified for the COVID-19
epidemic, mainly due to fluctuations in the capacity of testing and the near real-time availability of
information. The uncertainty is not exclusively related to the incidence data, there is also a large
variability in the value proposed in the literature for generation time or serial interval distributions
and average values [15-16].
Other studies have highlighted these issues. Gostic et al [7] quantified the effects of data
characteristics on Reff(t) estimates: reporting process; imperfect observation of cases; missing
observations of recent infections; estimation of the generation interval. Moreover, Pitzer et al [8]
showed that biases in Reff(t) are amplified when reporting delays have fluctuated due to the
availability and changing practices of testing. These two studies concluded that changes in diagnostic
testing and reporting processes must be monitored and taken into account when interpreting estimates
of the reproductive number of COVID-19. Nevertheless these changes are extremely difficult to
quantify. In these contexts, as testing capacity and reporting delays evolve, the use of hospital
admission and mortality data may be preferable for inferring reproduction numbers [9,17]. However,
the delays in the time from infection to hospitalization and/or death are also uncertain and, overall, it
is difficult to incorporate the uncertainty related to all of these delays [9,17,18].
In addition to the classical methods, a complementary approach consists in inferring changes in
transmission using mechanistic mathematical models, and computing Reff based on its proportionality
with the transmission rates [19-24]. The time-variation of Reff is computed indirectly by simply fitting
the model to different time periods (before or after the lockdown in the simplest cases) or by using
exponential decay models [21], but see Lemaitre et al [20].

To overcome all these numerous weaknesses in the data available for estimating Reff, we propose
using a framework that has been already implemented to tackle non-stationarity in epidemiology [2527]. It uses diffusion models driven by Brownian motion to model time-varying key epidemiological
parameters embedded in a stochastic state-space framework coupled with Bayesian inference
methods. The advantages of this approach compared to the existing ones consist in (i) the description
of the mechanisms underlying pathogen transmission and hence its particularities (asymptomatic
phase), (ii) the joint use of multiple datasets (incidence and hospital data), (iii) the explicit taking into
account of the uncertainty associated with the data used and especially (iv) the monitoring of the
temporal evolution of some of the model parameters without inclusion of external variables. Overall,
the main advantage of this approach is that it is data-driven. Indeed, in this framework, except for the
mechanistic assumptions underlying the model, the estimation of the time-varying parameters, based
on the available epidemiological observations [27], is done only under the non-specific assumption
that they follow a basic stochastic process.
Applied to COVID-19, this framework makes it possible to monitor the evolution of disease
transmission over time under non-stationary conditions such as those that prevailed during this
epidemic. To compare different geographical settings with similar population size, we have chosen to
illustrate our approach with data from several regions of France and Ireland.

Modeling a time-varying Reff
Our framework is based on three main components: a stochastic epidemiological model embedded in
a state-space framework, a diffusion process for each time-varying parameter and a Bayesian
inference algorithm based on adaptive particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) (see
Supporting Information). The main advantage of the state-space framework is to explicitly consider
the observation process. This allows for the unknowns and uncertainty in the partial observation of
the disease. The proposed epidemiological model accounts for the transmission characteristic of the
COVID-19 and the data features. Figure 1 illustrates model compartments and transition flows
between them. The temporal variation in the transmission rate β(t) was modeled by making the
assumption that it is not driven by specific mechanistic terms but evolves randomly though
constrained by the data. We consider that β(t) follows a continuous diffusion process:
dlog(β(t)) = ν.dB(t)
(1)
where ν is the volatility of the Brownian process (dB) to be estimated. The use of a Brownian process
can be viewed as a non-specific hypothesis for the supposed variation of β(t) and the volatility ν
being a regularized factor. Intuitively, the higher the values of ν the variations in β(t) but smaller ν
would induce smoother fluctuations of β(t). The logarithmic transformation avoids negative values
with no biological meaning.
Based on the SEIR model structure that accounts for the asymptomatic states (see Fig.1 and eqs S2),
the Reff(t) can be computed as:

where 1/γ is the average infection duration, τA is the fraction of asymptomatic individuals in the
population, (1-τA) the proportion of symptomatic infectious individuals and qi the reduction in the
transmissibility of some infected (I2) and asymptomatics (Ai) (see Fig. 1 and eqs S2 in the Supporting
Information). The effect of vaccination (already implemented in studied regions) is introduced in our
model simply by considering its effect on the depletion of susceptibles. The number of “effectively
protected vaccinated people”, proportional to the number of people vaccinated with one and/or two
doses, are removed from the susceptible compartment (see eq. S3 in the Supporting Information).
For parameter estimation we used PMCMC [28] suitable for partially observed stochastic non-linear
systems (see Supporting Information). The implementation is done with the SSM software [26].
Our estimations of Reff were compared, based on data from Ireland, with those obtained with two
other methods. The first method, proposed by Cori et al [14] and frequently used in recent studies
analyzing COVID-19 data, relies on the number of new infections generated during a given time
period and the serial interval distribution and is implemented in the EpiEstim package [29]. In the
second method new infections and hence Reff are generated using a simple discrete SIR model fitted
with Kalman-filtering tools [30].

Data used
During the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic the number of cases reported was very low and
associated with large uncertainties [10,12]. This was due, on the one hand, to the testing capacity
(RT-PCR laboratory capacity) that was limited and varied greatly during this epidemic [12] and, on
the other hand, to the features of this new virus, such as transmission before symptom onset and
substantial asymptomatic transmission, which resulted in a low fraction of infected people attending
health facilities for testing. This suggests that hospitalization data were likely to be the most accurate
COVID-19 related data [9,17]. Thus, we focused on hospital multiple datasets in France and in
Ireland. We used incidence data to avoid all the shortcomings associated with the use of cumulative
data (see [31]), i.e.: daily hospital admissions, daily ICU admissions, daily hospital deaths and daily
hospital discharges. We also used cases both in hospital and in ICU. Taking account for the large
variability in the daily observations and in particular for an important weekly component, since the
1st of May for French data and the 1st of June for Irish data, we have used a weekly average of the
observed daily values.
In France, since the beginning of the epidemic, the French regional health agencies (ARS – Agences
Régionales de Santé https://www.ars.sante.fr/) have been reporting a number of aggregated statistics.
We have also used data made available on the open platform for French public data [32]. In Ireland,
this data are published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC and we have used public
data [33]. Since the beginning of 2021, these two open platforms have also published the daily
vaccination data.
Since these hospital related multiple datasets were only available after the implementation of the first
panel of mitigation measures in France and in Ireland and that our aim was to estimate Reff before,
during and after the implementation of NPI measures, we also used reported incidence data for the
period before the implementation of these measures.

Results
The temporal evolution of both the transmission rate β(t) and Reff(t) (Fig. 2A) and the fit of the model
to the observed data are displayed in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 shows the time evolution of the Reff(t) (Fig. 3A)
and the dynamic of the model’s unobserved compartments. Another important characteristic of this
epidemic is the fact that the peak of daily hospital admission and daily ICU admission are
concomitant (Figs 2G-2H and S3,S6,S9,S12,S15,S18 Figs). This feature has been incorporated in the
model by allowing hospitalization or admission to ICU for each stage of the symptomatic infection
(Fig. 1 and eqs S2).
The capacity of our framework to describe the different types of data, among which some of them are
characterized by large noise (within the Paris region for instance) is also illustrated in Fig. 2. The main
advantage of this framework consists in its ability to reconstruct the time variation of the transmission
rate β(t) (Fig. 2A). Based on the estimation of β(t), we can compute the time-variation of Reff(t) (Fig. 2A)
and thus reconstruct the observed dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. Figure 3 provides the results
for each component of the epidemic dynamic model for the Paris region. Our main result is described in
Fig. 4 displaying the temporal evolution of the Reff in the five French regions considered and in Ireland.
Our estimates of the initial value of Reff lie in the range [3.0-3.5] in agreement with other estimates
[11,34]. The peak of Reff(t) just before the start date of the first mitigation measures is presumably an
effect of the model to accommodate diverging trends between reported case data and hospital related
data. Then one can note a decrease of about 80% in Reff between the 1st of March and the 1st of May
(during the first lockdown) in all the regions considered (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The reduction in the
transmission following the second lockdown was smaller, between 40% and 55% in France and less
than 25% in Ireland. In France, at the national level, the epidemic showed a slightly increasing plateau
before the third wave in April 2021. However, at the regional level and for regions with low
seroprevalence, a local third wave was observed. For these waves in Occitanie and Nouvelle Aquitaine a
reduction similar to the second wave was observed (Table 1). On the other hand, in Ireland, due to the
UK variant, a large wave was observed in January 2021, the reduction of Reff was again significant
(>70%) (Table 1). In all these cases, given the temporality of the decline compared to the timing of the
NPIs, these sharp decreases seem to be the result of the implementation of the mitigation measures.
We can also notice that there is a larger variability at the end of the observation period. As the dynamics
of the model are mainly driven by the hospitalization data, these latter determine the transmission rate
(and then Reff) during the interval [t-δt,t], with δt of the order of the average delay between infection and
hospitalization, of around 2-3 weeks (Figs 4A-4B).
Fig. 4 also illustrates the robustness and the sensitivity of our method. Firstly, Fig. 4A shows that
whether hospital discharge data are used or not during the inference process, similar medians and CI are
found. Secondly, Figs 4A-4B highlight the sensitivity to asymptomatic transmission: when
asymptomatic transmission increases (i.e. large qA value) lower values are inferred for β(t) hence leading
to lower Reff (the opposite happens when qA decreases).
Figs 3C-3D show that the number of asymptomatic infectious is of the same order of magnitude as
the number of symptomatic infectious but with a larger uncertainty due to lack of information in the

data. Indeed, the data used contain very little information on asymptomatics and we observe identical
prior and posterior distributions for the rate of asymptomatic, τA (S1,S5,S8 Figs).
In our model approach, one can also estimate the number of removed individuals. We can clearly
show that as the course of the epidemic advances the number of removed individuals increases and
this increase is amplified by the introduction of the vaccination (Fig. 3H and S4,S7,S10,S13,S19
Figs), inducing a significant rise in seroprevalence (Table 2). Concerning the vaccination, we have
only considered an additional depletion term in the susceptibles dynamics (see Supplementary
Information, and equations (S2-S3)). The effects of the vaccination on Reff(t) seem not to be yet very
significant, the depletion of susceptibles being slightly inversely proportional to an increase of β(t)
(see S21 Fig). It is also worth noting that the seroprevalence calculated as of 15th of May for France
or the 1st of July for Ireland was entirely consistent with the published results of the seroprevalence
surveys (Table 2).

The comparison of the performances of our estimations of Reff with those of two others methods is
summarized in Fig. 5. It is difficult to compare the absolute values of the estimates obtained with the
three methods because the true values are unknown and speculative, but we can limit ourselves to
comparing the trends given by these methods. The trajectory of Reff over time computed by other
methods fall within the range of our 95% CI, which is large because of uncertainties in the
transmission rate, asymptomatic transmission and the different delays needed to describe hospital
data. We can also note that the 95% CI of Reff obtained with the EpiEstim method is very narrow and
its width is smaller than the variability of fluctuations in its median. The main differences between
the three estimates relate to the time-lags of the effects of the lockdown, the peaks of Reff and the date
of crossing the threshold which is equal to 1. These lags range from one week to more than one
month and do not correspond to the early or late lags of the date of crossing 1, when comparing to the
estimations provided by our method.
A final important point concerns the observed incidence. We have used the incidence data until the
22 March (Fig. 2B, black points; S6-S9-S12-S15-S18 Figs) in the inference process leading to a

region (Table S2). The plotted dynamics of the estimated observed incidence uses this value for the
whole trajectory. The values of the reporting rate for the other regions are in S2 Table. The
comparison of the observed incidence when available and the simulated incidence (Fig 2 and
S3,S6,S9,S12,S15,S18 Figs) clearly illustrates that the reporting rate has greatly evolved during the
course of the epidemic. It is relatively easy to see that during the first wave the observed peak of
incidence comes after the peak of hospitalization, whereas for the second wave the opposite happens,
in agreement with what can be expected. Moreover, if we compare the intensity of the observed
incidence waves, we can see that the second observed wave is 5 to 10 times greater than the first one,
while model-based simulations suggest that they have similar magnitudes. This difference cannot
only be explained by the fact that, as the frequency of testing increases, it is also increasingly likely
that some of people tested positive are asymptomatic, whereas in the model the people tested are
considered symptomatic. In any case, it appears crucial to be able to take into account a reporting
delay that seems relatively large for the COVID-19 epidemic using models for now-casting [35-36]
or a detailed observation model [18].

Discussion
For any epidemic, it is always essential to estimate pathogen transmissibility in order to provide
information on its potential spread in the population. This is commonly done using the effective
reproduction number Reff(t). Its time evolution allows us to follow, almost in real time, the course of
the epidemic, and to get information regarding the potential effects of mitigation measures taken.
Here we propose a mechanistic approach based on time-varying parameters embedded in a stochastic
model coupled with Bayesian inference. This enables us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the
transmission rate of COVID-19 with the non-specific hypothesis that it follows a basic stochastic
process constrained by the available data. Using this approach we can describe both the temporal
evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic and its Reff(t). Thus, we can quantify the effect of mitigation
measures on the epidemics waves in France and in Ireland. It is important to note that this
methodology overcomes many of the biases overcomes associated with estimates of Reff(t) obtained
using existing methods in the case of COVD-19 [6-7]. Indeed, these biases are related to underreporting of infectious cases, uncertainties in the generation time and in the serial interval, and also to
the importance of silent transmission. Moreover, these biases are amplified by the fact that reporting
delays have fluctuated widely over the course of the epidemic [8].
Within our framework, the estimates of Reff(t) represent the values required to reproduce the welldocumented hospital data. Such data are clearly of a higher quality than the reported number of cases
[17-18]. Moreover, this estimation accounts for transmission mechanisms and the different delays
describe the transmission process (even during the asymptomatic phase) and the different processes
related to the hospital (Fig. 1). Using our approach, by visualizing the evolution of Reff(t) we can
follow the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in five French regions and in Ireland. Therefore, we
can quantify the effect of the mitigation measures during and between epidemics waves. For the first
lockdown, we estimated a decrease of around 80% in transmission in both countries. For the second

wave, our reduction estimations were between 45 to 55% in French regions and around 20% in
Ireland (Table 1). While France is undergoing another major epidemic wave, we have estimated a
reduction of more than 70% of the transmissibility of the third wave in Ireland (Table 1). These
reductions in transmission may reflect the nature of the mitigation measures implemented in both
countries. For the second wave, these measures were less restrictive than during the first wave,
nevertheless the second wave was also less severe. In Ireland, the mitigation measures introduced in
the third wave were similar to the first wave.
We also found other interesting results such as a significant high correlation between the trend of
mobility and our estimation of the transmission between the epidemic waves (see S22 Fig. and [37]),
highlighting the importance of following the evolution of mobility when relaxing mitigation
measures to anticipate the future evolution of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
We have also compared the trend of our estimations of Reff with those of two other methods from the
literature [14,30] on data from Ireland (Fig. 5). One of the differences between our estimations and
the two others is a greater variability of our Reff estimations due to an underlying complex
mechanistic model used and to uncertainties in the transmission rate, asymptomatic transmission and
in the different delays needed for describing hospital multiple datasets. A second difference consists
in asynchronous peaks of Reff. For instance, the peak of Reff occurs at the beginning of August for the
two other methods, while our estimates suggest a peak in mid-September (Fig. 5). These differences
may be explained by the differences in model complexity but, above all, by the fact that the two other
methods computed their estimations based on the new cases only, which are data subject to certain
bias [6-8]. The peak of Reff in early August could be explained by an increase in testing during
summer holydays while our estimates peaked later due to the increase in hospitalization generated by
higher values of new infections in early September when the economy restarted. We therefore believe
that our estimates based on admissions in hospital and ICU and deaths were more consistent with the
peak of the second waves of hospitalization that was observed in late October in Ireland (S6-S7 Figs).
This reinforces the relevance of our modeling and inference framework to present a more coherent
picture of the evolution of this epidemic.
The main characteristic of our approach is the dependence of the Reff(t) estimations on the relevance
of the underlying mechanistic model and the accuracy and completeness of the available data. In our
case, inference was based on hospital data that are clearly of a higher quality and accuracy compared
to the observed number of infected cases. Moreover, despite its relative simplicity, the model
incorporating time varying transmission rate is able to accurately describe the hospital multiple
datasets that included daily hospitalized admission for COVID-19, daily ICU admission, daily deaths
at hospital and also the number of beds used each day both in hospital and ICU. Furthermore our
model can be partially validated by quite a good description of daily hospital discharges that are not
explicitly used in the fitting process. This partial validation is strengthened by the fact that our
predicted seroprevalence in the French regions and in Ireland are in complete agreement with the
results published from seroprevalence surveys in these settings (see Table 2). To highlight our model
results, we can see that the asymptomatic infectious are as numerous as symptomatic ones, but are
characterized by a larger uncertainty, due to the lack of information in the data (Figs 3C-3D and
figures in the Supporting Information). This is in agreement with recent papers [11,24,38,39], which
emphasize that the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic is driven by silent infections. This has also

been highlighted in Ireland where it has been estimated that during the second epidemic wave the
ratio of silent infections to known reported cases was approximately 1:1 [40]. It is indeed interesting
to note that our model estimates for asymptomatic cases in Ireland lead to similar ratios but with a
large 95% CI (see Fig. S7).
Our study is not without limitations. The model used here is, like all complex SEIR models
developed for COVID-19, non-identifiable. This means that it is likely that several solutions, i.e.
several sets of parameter values, allow to reproduce observations and we only present one of the most
likely ones.This point is overlooked very ofen but see [41]. One limitation is the use of the classical
homogeneous mixing assumption in which all individuals are assumed to interact uniformly and
ignores heterogeneity between groups by sex, age, geographical region. However, this kind of data is
not readily available. When mixing patterns among age groups are available at the individual level in
contact tracing databases, they are only accessible following extensive ethical reviews. Another
weakness is related to the absence of an age-structure in the model, which would allow generating
age-specific predictions. In all cases, considering an age structure and a contact matrix appears
insufficient and heterogeneity of contacts is important (see [39]). Nevertheless, in our opinion, these
limitations are more than balanced by the fact that we take into account the non-stationarity of the
epidemic data and that our results are mainly driven by hospital related data, which is more accurate
and timely than the number of infected cases. As our main objective was to infer global Reff, and not
to explore age-specific mitigation strategies, the simplification of the age structure appears justified.
The corroboration of our findings on the Irish case on proportions asymptomatic individuals with
those of others provides further evidence of this [40].
As demonstrated previously, modeling with time varying parameter is an interesting framework for
modeling the temporal evolution of an epidemic even if the knowledge about disease transmission is
either incomplete or uncertain [27]. Indeed a large part of all the unknowns can be put in the timevarying parameters described by a diffusion process but driven by the observed data. This is exactly
what we have been confronted during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the data are uncertain, as are the
transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. We therefore proposed to model the spread of this
disease using a stochastic model with a time-varying transmission rate inferred using welldocumented hospital multiple datasets. The knowledge of the transmission rate makes it possible to
easily calculate the Reff(t), which is a key parameter of the epidemic, in order to monitor the potential
effects of public health policies on the course the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, we believe that
this framework could be particularly useful to analyze the next evolution of the epidemic in relation
to the emergence of new variants and to help refine potential mitigation measures, after the third
wave, during the period where these measures will be progressively lifted, pending the complete
vaccination of the population.

Figure Captions
Figure 1. Flow diagram of a generalized SEIR model accounting for asymptomatic transmission and
a simplified hospital system (see eqs S2). The variables are: the susceptibles S, the infected noninfectious E, the infectious symptomatic I, the infectious asymptomatic A, the removed individuals R,
and the hospital related variables: the hospitalized individuals H, the individuals in intensive care unit
ICU, and the deaths at hospital D. The subscripts 1 and 2 stand for the two stages of the Erlang
distribution of the sojourn times in E, A, I, H. The flow from H2 to R represents hospital discharge.
Flows in blue are from hospital (Hi) and flow in red from ICU.
λ’(t) = β(t).(I1+q1.I2+q2.(A1+A2))/N then the force of infection is λ(t) = λ’(t).S(t) and β(t) is the timevarying transmission rate (1), σ the incubation rate, γ the recovery rate, 1/κ the average
hospitalization period, 1/δ the average time spent in ICU, τA the fraction of asymptomatics, τH the
fraction of infectious hospitalized, τI the fraction of ICU admission, τD death rate, q1 and q2 the
reduction in the transmissibility of I2 and Ai, qI the reduction in the fraction of people admitted in
ICU and qD the reduction in the death rate.
Figure 2. Reconstruction of the observed dynamics of COVID-19 in Ile-de-France, the Paris
region. (A) Time evolution of both β(t) and Reff (t). (B) Simulated and observed incidence. (C-D)
New daily admissions to hospital and to ICU. (E) Daily new deaths. (F) Hospital discharges. (G-H)
Cases in Hospital and in ICU per day (average of daily data over the current week is used after 0105-2020).
The black points are observations used in the inference process, the white points are the observations
not used. The blue lines are the median of the posterior estimates of the simulated trajectories, the
purple areas are the 50% Credible Intervals (CI) and the light blue areas the 95% CI. In (A) the
orange area is the 50% CI of Reff. The vertical dashed lines show the implementation dates of the
main NPI measures and the dot-dashed lines are for cases where only one part of the region has been
subjected to these measures. The horizontal dashed-line is the threshold Reff = 1. For (B-H), the
corresponding reporting rate is applied to the simulated trajectories for comparison with observations.

susceptibles S(t) and Reff (t). (B) Infected non infectious, E(t) = E1(t)+E2(t). (C) Symptomatic
infectious I(t) = I1(t)+I2(t). (D) Asymptomatic infectious A(t) = A1(t)+A2(t). (E) Hospitalized
individuals H(t) = H1(t)+H2(t)+ICU(t). (F) Individuals in ICU, ICU(t). (G) Cumulative death D(t).
(H) Removed individuals R(t).
The blue lines are the median of the posterior estimates of the simulated trajectories, the purple areas
are the 50% Credible Intervals (CI) and the light blue areas the 95% CI. In (A) the orange area
corresponds to the 50% CI of Reff. The black points are observations used in the inference process, the
white points are the observations not used. In (H) the red line shows the median of R(t) when the
“effectively protected vaccinated people” have been subtracted.

Rhône Alpes.
The blue lines are the median of the posterior estimates of Reff (t) and orange and yellow areas are the
95% CI of Reff. In (A) the orange area corresponds to the case where hospital discharges are included

in the inference process, whereas the yellow area corresponds to the model that does not account for
them.
In (A) and (B) the dashed curves represent the median of Reff for a preceding time period (blue), or
computed with lower transmissibility of the asymptomatics, qA=0.40 (black) or computed with higher
transmissibility, qA=0.70 (red). The vertical black dashed lines correspond to the start dates of the
main mitigation measures, the dot-dashed lines are for cases where only one part of the region has
been subjected to these measures. The horizontal dashed-line is the threshold Reff = 1.
Figure 5. Comparison between our Reff(t) estimation and those obtained with two other methods
based on Irish multiple datasets. A/ Comparison with the method implemented in EpiEstim R
package (http://metrics.covid19-analysis.org/). B/ Comparison with the method proposed by ArroyoMarioli et al [28] (http://trackingr-env.eba-9muars8y.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
Blue lines are the median of the posterior of our estimates of Reff (t) and orange areas are the
corresponding 95% CI of our Reff estimates. The black lines represent the median of Reff (t) for the
other methods and the black dotted-dashed lines delimit the corresponding 95% CI associated. In B/
the black dashed lines delimited the 65% CI. The vertical black dashed lines correspond to the start
dates of the main mitigation measures. The horizontal dashed-line is the threshold Reff = 1.
