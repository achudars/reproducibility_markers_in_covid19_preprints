Clinical characteristics of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection

characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis.
Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV
infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of
cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the
percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV
infection was 4.3%.
Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of
these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as
ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of
patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

1 Introduction
Since December 2019, the epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infectious pneumonia in Wuhan,
China. The Chinese government and researchers have taken rapid measures to control the epidemic

[1]

. On January

30, 2020, WHO declared that the epidemic of 2019-nCoV was a public health emergency of international concern
(PHEIC). At present, the number of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is still rising, and its harm to human beings
has exceeded the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SRAS) in China, 2002

[2]

. The clinical

characteristics and the case fatality rate after 2019-nCoV infection have always been concerned by people, and it
is also the focus of medical workers' research at present. However, due to the different design of different clinical
studies and insufficient sample size, the conclusions of the published studies were different. In order to acquire

searched the relevant literatures and carried out single arm Meta-analysis[3] . Our findings provide important
guidance for current clinical work on the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.

2 Material and Methods
2.1 Search strategy
Three popular medical databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for
related literatures, using the following keywords: "2019-nCoV", "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" and
"Wuhan Coronavirus". Articles reviewed were dated up to February 2020. In this Meta-analysis, there was no
language restriction. Only available data from published articles were collected. Data from unpublished papers
were not included.
2.2 The inclusive and exclusive criteria

more accurate conclusions on the clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with 2019-nCoV infection, we

case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and also case reports on the clinical characteristics of
patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV infection include fever,
cough, muscle soreness or fatigue, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), abnormal chest computer
tomography (CT) detection, patients in critical condition, as well as death due to 2019-nCoV infection.
2.2.2 Exclusive criteria: articles were published repeatedly; studies did not include the research indicators needed
for Meta-analysis; research data were missing.
2.3 Data extraction and paper quality evaluation
First of all, we screened the literature according to the literature abstract, excluding the articles that obviously do
not meet the inclusive criteria, and then read the full article for re-screening. If any disagreement on the choice of
the literature exists, a third evaluator will join to make the decision. All included literature were evaluated using
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)
2.4 Statistical analysis

[4]

. The highest quality of the literature was 9 stars and the lowest 0 stars.

2.2.1 Inclusive criteria: studies that include randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials,

included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to normal
distribution and then analyzed in Stata. The initial conclusion obtained by Meta-analysis was then restored using
formula (P=(sin(tp/2))2) to reach final conclusion. In order to objectively evaluate the publication bias of the
included literature, the Egger test with P < 0.05 as the existence of publication bias was performed, the values
larger than which were considered as no publication bias.

3 Results
3.1 Literature inclusion
A total of 284 articles were retrieved, among which 39 papers were removed due to repeated retrieval, 212 papers
were removed after reading abstracts, 23 were eliminated after reading the full text. At the end, a total of 10
articles

[5-14]

were included in this Meta-analysis, including data from 50466 patients. The specific operation flow

is shown in Figure 1. The characteristics of the literature are shown in Table 1.

The statistical software Stata version 12.0 was used to carry out the single arm Meta-analysis. Original data

Through Meta-analysis, we found that among all the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV infection,
the incidence of fever was 89.1% (Figure 2), that of cough was 72.2% (Figure 3), and that of muscle soreness or
fatigue was 42.5% (Figure 4). The incidence of ARDS was 14.8% (Figure 5), correspondingly that of abnormal
chest CT detection was 96.6% (Figure 6), severe cases in all infected cases occupied a percentage of 18.1%
(Figure 7). The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3% (Figure 8). Detailed results of
Meta-analysis are shown in Table 2.
3.3 Publication bias detection
The results of Egger test in Table 3. There was publication bias in the Meta-analysis of the ARDS
group(P=0.008)..

3.2 Meta-analysis results

zoonotic coronavirus disease after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS). Wei Ji et al.

[15]

found that 2019-nCoV seemed to be a recombinant virus between bat

coronavirus and coronavirus of another unknown origin. Kangpeng Xiao et al.

[16]

confirmed that malayan

pangolins were the most likely intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The research of Domenico Benvenuto et al.

[17]

found that 2019-nCoV was only closely related to the coronavirus isolated from chrysanthemum-headed bat in
2015. Their research suggests that bats may be the reservoir host for 2019-nCoV. According to the research by
Peng Zhou et al.

[18]

and Fan Wu et al.

[19]

, it was found that the sequence homology between 2019-nCoV and

SARS-CoV was 79.5%. The homology between 2019-nCoV and bat coronavirus at the genetic level was 96%.
Therefore, very likely it can be confirmed that 2019-nCoV comes from bats.
According to the results of Meta-analysis, we find that the most common symptoms of patients with 2019-nCoV
infection were fever and cough, and most of the patients had abnormal chest CT. Some patients with 2019-nCoV
infection had muscle soreness or fatigue, ARDS, and other symptoms. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat,

2019-nCoV is one type of coronaviruses which belongs to β -coronavirus cluster. It causes the third kind of

infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate was 4.3%. At present, the Chinese government has announced
that the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection in China is 3.36%, which is lower than that of
another two widely contagious zoonotic coronavirus diseases, SARS and MERS. Infection mortality rates of SARS
and MERS are 9.6%

have shown that viral infection could increase the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Xie et al.

found that 45% of patients showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis within one month after being infected with

SARS-CoV. Hui et al.

[24]

revealed that 36% and 30% of patients infected with SARS-CoV developed pulmonary

fibrosis 3 and 6 months after infection. These studies consistently suggest that pulmonary fibrosis will become one
of the serious complications in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. How to prevent and reduce the occurrence of
pulmonary fibrosis in patients with 2019-nCoV infection are urgent problems for medical workers in the treatment
of 2019-nCoV.

[25]

found that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was the receptor of 2019-nCoV. In normal

lung tissue, ACE2 is mainly expressed by type  and type  alveolar epithelial cells. It was reported that 83% of
II-type alveolar cells expressed ACE2. Therefore, 2019-nCoV infection causes damages to most II type alveolar
cells. In addition, the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection can also
aggravate the injury of alveolar cells. After alveolar cell injury, transforming growth factor-β (TGF- β) released in
tissue promotes the lung repair. Virus infection often leads to excessive activation of TGF- β pathway, which leads
to the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis.

Based on the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis after virus infection, we can formulate corresponding prevention
and treatment proposals. The first is the treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. At present, a variety of drugs have
been found to inhibit 2019-nCoV. Michelle L. Holshue et al.

achieved remarkable results in the treatment of

patients with 2019-nCoV infection with remdesivir. This drug is currently in clinical trials. Second, it is necessary

traditional antibacterial effects, but also have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties

[27]

. Macrolide

antibiotics such as clarithromycin, azithromycin, and erythromycin prevent the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and immune mediators

[28]

. The third is to inhibit the fibrogenic effect of TGF- β . Luo et al.

[29]

found

that arsenic trioxide could inhibit the signal transduction of TGF- β and play a role in anti-fibrosis. The fourth is
the rational use of ventilator to avoid unnecessary lung damages. In addition, pirfenidone and nintedanib as drugs
for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can also be used to prevent and treat pulmonary fibrosis in
patients with 2019-nCoV infection

[30]

.

In all, a total of 10 articles were covered in the Meta-analysis, including 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection.
By far, it is the first Meta-analysis with the largest sample size. The quality of the literature included in this study
is high, the analysis is rigorous, and the conclusions drawn by the study are highly credible. However, this
Meta-analysis also has some limitations: 1) All studies included in this Meta-analysis are retrospective studies

to inhibit the inflammatory reaction and reduce the exudation. On this direction, antibiotics not only have

of this study to predict patients in general, including other countries and races; 3) There was publication bias in the
Meta-analysis of the ARDS group. The analytical conclusion of the ARDS group may be influenced by publication
bias. Therefore, based on the above limitations, the conclusions of this Meta-analysis still need to be verified by
more relevant studies with more careful design, more rigorous execution, and larger sample size.
