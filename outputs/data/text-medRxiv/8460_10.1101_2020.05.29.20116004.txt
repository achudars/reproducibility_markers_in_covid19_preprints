ABSTRACT
Accurate surveillance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence requires
large-scale testing of the population. Current testing methods require in-person
collection of biospecimens by a healthcare worker, limiting access of individuals who
do not have access to testing facilities while placing both patients and healthcare
workers at risk of exposure to infection. We report the development and validation of a
at-home finger-prick dried blood spot collection kit and an analysis method. We
demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity using at-home collected specimens
across the US. Such methods may facilitate the conduct of unbiased serosurveys within
hard to reach populations and help reduce the sample collection burden of serological
testing on both health care systems and individuals alike.

INTRODUCTION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known
as 2019-nCoV, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus in the family Coronaviridae,
genus Betacoronavirus1-3. At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to
more than 4.3 million confirmed cases globally and claimed approximately 300,000
lives.
While direct detection of the virus by RNA or antigen assays remains the standard
for confirming acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, serological antibody testing is of
increasing importance for many reasons4-8. Antibody tests can complement RNA tests
by improving the diagnostic yield among suspected cases that have false negative
RNA/antigen tests due to sampling or assay technical limitations. Furthermore,
serological assays are also important for assessing asymptomatic infection in close
contacts, identifying individuals with resolved infection as potential contributors of
convalescent plasma therapy, enabling estimation of population infection prevalence
and illuminating our understanding of contributing factors conferring immunity to reinfection.
All currently approved serological tests require blood specimens collected inperson by a healthcare worker either through phlebotomy or finger-prick. The need for
in-person collection limits access to testing for individuals who may not be able to get
to a testing center due to distance, disability or inconvenience. The in-person collection
process is labor intensive, driving up testing costs and diverting healthcare resources
from the care of ill individuals. In-person collection processes carry an increased risk
of infection due to potential exposure to a confluence of contagious individuals and
consumes large quantities of valuable personal protective equipment (PPE).
In principle, rapid tests such as lateral flow assays may at some point be approved
for at-home testing. However, lateral flow tests have shown an alarmingly wide
performance dispersion even when performed by trained personnel in controlled
clinical settings, with many tests exhibiting inadequate sensitivity and specificity9. The
accuracy of lateral flow tests for at-home testing will require significant improvement
and extensive additional validation before they can be trusted as clinically and
epidemiologically useful. Integrity in self-reporting of the results of home-administered
lateral flow tests also poses major challenges.
Here, we report the development of an at-home finger-prick dried blood spot
collection kit and an accompanying laboratory test to elute and accurately detect
antibodies in this convenient sample type with 100% concordance to their clinical status.
For this study, we created standardized dried blood spot collection kits for reciprocal
mailing to and from the homes of potential participants. These kits contained lancets
for self-collection of blood and dried blood spot cards to capture and preserve the

specimens for transport. The kits were then mailed back to a central laboratory for
extraction and analysis. This type of home-to-lab sourced samples can provide the high
quality and consistency of a reference lab based serological test without exposing
patients or healthcare workers to unnecessary risks.
METHODS
Materials
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1) containing amino acids 1-674 with an Fc-tag
at the C-terminus (#31806), expressed in HEK293 cells, was purchased from the Native
Antigen Company (Oxford, United Kingdom). Oligonucleotides used in the study were
custom ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Platinum Taq
polymerase (#10966026), SYBR qPCR 2X master mix (#4385610), Dithiothreitol
(DTT #202090) and sulfo-SMCC (#22122) were purchased from Thermo Fisher
(Waltham, MA). DNA ligase (#A8101) was purchased from LGC (Teddington, United
Kingdom). Other reagents are detailed in the method sections as appropriate.
Human specimens used in the study.
Individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR between March
– April 2020 were recruited to the study via social media. Healthy donors without
SARS-CoV-2 symptoms were enrolled as negative controls. All participants provided
informed consent under the Western IRB approved IRB protocol #20180015 to Enable
Biosciences. Dried blood spot collection kits were mailed to each participant for athome sample collection. We requested two to five dried blood spots from each
participant. Completed dried blood spots were dropped off in standard United States
Postal Service (USPS) blue drop boxes for ground return shipment to Enable
Biosciences. The entire process was done at ambient temperature without a cold chain.
A total of 56 self-collected finger-prick dried blood spot specimens were received.
Negative control specimens were collected from 25 donors, and positive specimens
were collected from 31 COVID-19 patients. The patients were deemed infected if
symptomatic and tested positive by RT-PCR (N=30) or by validated serum antibody
tests (N=1).
In addition to dried blood spots, K2- EDTA plasma specimens were collected by
phlebotomy from 8 selected participants (4 from COVID-19 patients and 4 from health
controls).
Dried blood spot collection kit
The dried blood spot collection kit contained a sample collection instruction sheet,
disposable lancets, a dried blood spot card, alcohol pads, Band Aids and a pre-printed

return label. The participant was asked to clean the collection site with the sterile
alcohol pad and then use the disposable lancet to prick the finger. Finger-prick blood
was then carefully dropped onto each dried blood spot card until a complete circle was
filled. A minimum of two spots per participant was requested. The kit contained
multiple lancets in case a single prick proved insufficient to generate multiple spots.
Given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is rarely detected in the blood of recovered donors
or donors with mild to moderate symptoms, the dried blood spot specimens presented
a minimal biohazard risk10,11. Furthermore, dried blood spots were fully dried prior to
shipment, thus further lowering the risk profile. The dried blood spot return kits were
transported by standard postal mail service with UN3373 Biological Substance
Category B Labels affixed. Once received, the dried blood spot cards were stored at 28°C until analyzed.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in dried blood spots.
The dried blood spot analysis comprised elution and testing steps. For elution, six
3mm discs were punched from a single dried blood spot. In rare circumstances where a
dried blood spot was not completely filled, six 3mm discs were punched from multiple
spots. Then, the discs were incubated with 1000 μL of elution buffer for 90 min on a
heat shaker at 37°C for elution. Then, the eluent was concentrated with a 100 kDa
molecular weight cut-off column (MWCO) for 8min at 14,000 rcf.
For the testing, the eluent was assayed using a modified Antibody Detection by
Agglutination-PCR (ADAP) protocol12-14. Briefly, 8 µL of eluent was incubated with 8
µL of 1 femtomole of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit-DNA conjugate pair
mixtures at 37 °C for 30 min. If present, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the specimen
engage with S1-DNA conjugate to agglutinate into a dense immune complex. To
quantify the degree of agglutination, 116 µL of ligation solution (20 mM Tris, 50 mM
KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, 25 μM NAD, 0.025 U/μl ligase, 100 nM connector)
was mixed with 4 µL eluent/conjugate mixture and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Then,
25 µL of the ligated solution was mixed with PCR master mix that contained primer
pairs and polymerase for amplification under standard thermocycling conditions (95 °C
for 10 min, 95 °C for 15 sec, 56 °C for 30 sec, 13 cycles). The pre-amplified products
were then quantified in a 96-well qPCR plate. SYBR green-based qPCR was performed
on a Bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (95 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 30
sec, 56 °C for 1 min, 40 cycles). As a result of agglutination, specimens harboring high
quantities of antibodies will have large quantities of amplifiable DNA, thus exhibiting
a strong qPCR signal (low Ct). In contrast, samples without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
will have few DNA amplicons, thus yielding a weaker qPCR signal (high Ct). Instead
of using the common cycle threshold (Ct) as readout, the ADAP assay readout ΔCt is

defined as the Ct value of a blank control minus the Ct of the actual specimen. The
magnitude of the ΔCt is proportional to the amplicon concentration in the PCR plate
well, which in turn is proportional to the amount of antibody present in the sample. The
ΔCt offers significant reproducibility since the subtraction of the blank control Ct and
the sample Ct cancels out any potential drift across runs.
To ensure the quality of the process, one positive and one negative control dried
blood spots cards were always analyzed concurrently. The control cards went through
the entire elution and testing process. The analysis was only valid if the positive control
cards tested positive and the negative cards tested negative.
RESULTS
Cohort characteristics
We used social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Medium) and community referrals
to recruit volunteers for the study. We aimed to enroll both COVID-19 patients (positive
controls) and healthy donors (negative controls) to validate the sensitivity and
specificity of the serological test using self-collected dried blood spots. The COVID19 patients were eligible to participate in the study if they presented with COVID-19
symptoms and were confirmed positive by either RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
and/or a validated serum/plasma serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The
control patients were included in the study if they had no symptoms and/or no known
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and/or tested negative by validated serum/plasma serological
tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
Eligible participants received a dried blood spot mailer kit that included
comprehensive instructions for self-collection of finger-prick spots. The mailer kit
contained a pre-printed return label to ship the kit back to the Enable Biosciences
laboratory in South San Francisco by USPS.
A total of 56 specimens were received for the study, where 31 were from COVID19 patients and 25 were from healthy donors. The patient demographics were
summarized in Table 1. Notably, several donors were from out-of-state locations distant
from the Enable Biosciences facilities. Since the dried blood spots were returned via
ground shipping at ambient temperature, the inclusion of such donors allowed us to
investigate the potential impact of long-distance transportation on sample quality and
analytical performance.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in self-collected finger-prick dried blood spots
We first evaluated the clinical sensitivity and specificity of self-collected fingerprick dried blood spots. Among 31 COVID-19 patients, 31 tested positive for SARSCoV-2 antibodies. For 25 healthy donors, 25 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2

antibodies. The preliminary results indicated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity of
mailer-based finger-prick dried blood spot specimens (Fig. 1). The study is still ongoing
to expand the cohort size.
In addition to clinical performance, we also evaluated the signal distribution
between samples collected in immediate proximity to the testing laboratory and those
from distant areas. For COVID-19 patients, 20 specimens were collected within 100
miles of testing labs, while 11 specimens were collected from locations over 1500 miles
away. The signal distribution between these two groups did not reach statistical
significance (Fig. 2). Similar observations were made for the healthy control patient
groups. The actual transit time of the completed kits, irrespective of the individual’s
physical distance away from the lab, ranged from 0-5 days. 88% of all test kits arrived
within 3 days of the person mailing the completed kit back to Enable Biosciences using
either USPS Priority or First-Class Mail. The data demonstrated excellent dried blood
spot specimen integrity even after long-range transportation at ambient temperatures.
Correlation of SARS-CoV-2 antibody signals between sample types.
In addition to sensitivity and specificity, it is critical to compare the antibody signals
in self-collected finger-prick dried blood spots to venipuncture-based blood samples.
The lancets used in self-collected finger-prick samples are shorter than the needles used
for venipuncture. Untrained individuals collecting at home may use a wide range of
lancing techniques and differing puncture sites. As a result, finger-prick blood could
conceivably be partially diluted by extra-venous tissue fluids.
To evaluate the impact of these possibilities, we collected K2-EDTA plasma
samples by standard phlebotomy from 4 COVID-19 patients and 4 healthy controls.
The plasma samples were tested using the standard ADAP assay for SARS-CoV-2
antibodies. The data showed that the plasma signals were highly consistent and well
correlated with those from self-collected sample types (Fig. 3), effectively eliminating
the theoretical sampling concerns of at-home collected dried blood spot samples for
SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement.
DISCUSSION
Serological testing plays a significant role in the management of SARS-CoV-2
infection. First, RT-PCR may produce false negative results in the setting of low viral
loads. Antibodies could serve as a complementary marker to boost the accuracy of RTPCR testing in the waxing and waning phases of viral infection. Secondly, the presence
of antibodies indicates past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Thus, antibody-based
serosurveys are key to measuring disease prevalence at the population level. This data
is critical for accurate characterization of essential parameters such as fatality rates,

basic reproduction number (Ro) and others15. Finally, convalescent plasma has been
shown as a safe and promising therapy to mitigate disease16,17. Serological testing can
help identify eligible donors for further antibody characterization by methods such as
neutralization assays.
However, the constraint of phlebotomy for sample collection for current
serological tests has curtailed these potential benefits. Many at-home collection RTPCR RNA tests have received regulatory approvals. To yield a complete picture of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is highly desirable to pair suitable molecular diagnostic with
self-collected serological tests
The dried blood spot collection kit and testing method reported in this study have
the potential for wide-spread use. Obviating phlebotomy could improve both testing
safety and testing access, while reducing the sample collection burden on severely
stressed healthcare systems. The stability of dried blood spots at ambient temperature
for extended time periods permits standard mail parcel transportation service use
without requiring cold chain preservation measures. Importantly, mailer-based selfcollected samples may reduce bias and improve participation within underserved or
sequestered communities by reaching populations beyond those accessed by
serosurveys that rely solely on collection at drive-through clinics.
Since the dried blood spot modality has the potential for wide scale screening, it
is critical to ensure the specificity of this test. The use of ADAP methods for dried blood
spot eluent testing may have an additional unique advantage in that the ADAP method
consumes a very small volume of eluent (e.g. 8 μL) per test. It is thus possible to
conserve samples to support further analyses via a comprehensive reflex testing
algorithm to further enhance test accuracy. For instance, it is potentially feasible to
conduct the primary screening of the eluent by detecting only anti-S1 protein antibodies.
Samples that test positive can then be reflexed for confirmatory testing for anti-N
protein antibody without having to elute additional samples from another spot.
In summary, we report a self-collection kit for at-home finger-prick dried blood
spot collection with a method to elute and test the specimen that show comparable
analytical performance to venipuncture-derived blood samples. If proven successful at
large scale, this method can greatly facilitate the conduct of unbiased serosurveys
within hard to reach populations and help reduce the sample collection burden of
serological testing on both health care systems and individuals alike.
