Abstract
The emergence and pandemic of COVID-19 has rapidly become a global concern. In Italy, on 27
March 2020, there were 8165 deaths and 80539 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Demographic
situations, like age profiles is reported to be the cause of high case fatality rate (CFR) in Italy. In
Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has not yet grasped epic proportion, but the estimation of CFR
is still needed. We compared the CFR observed in Italy with the age profiles in 46 Africa
countries and 2 territories which are already confirmed COVID-19 case. The estimation of the
CFR in Africa ranges between (1.0%-5.4%) while in Italy is 10.1%. The five highest CFR
countries and territories in Africa are Reunion (5.4%), Mauritius (5.1%), Tunisia (3.9%),
Seychelles (3.8%) and Morocco (3.3%). The last three countries with low CFR are Uganda
(1.0%), Zambia (1.1%) and Angola (1.1%). The observed difference is related to the age profiles.

Keywords: COVID-19, case fatality rate, Italy, Africa, age profiles.

Introduction
Africa continent holds 54 countries with 1.3 billion of the population with a median age of 19.7
years old [1]. Up to now around 46 countries and 2 territories already have confirmed 2419
people infected and 39 deaths from COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO)
situation report [2]. Each country in Africa declare its own decisive public health measures
according to their local epidemiological situation amid COVID-19 such as bans on public
gathering, canceling conference or sports events, closing borders, bans travel restrictions,
shutting downs schools, self-quarantine to enhance social distancing as WHO and health experts
recommended [3] to slow the country’s rate of COVID-19 transmission. The widespread of
COIVD-19 has infected over 509164 people worldwide by 27 March 2020 [2]. People with preexisting conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
hypertension and cancer are more susceptible to COVID-19 [4]. We hypothesized that if the age
structure is a crucial key of the high case fatality rate in Italy from COVID-19, what can be
happened in Africa based on the demographic profiles. Italy is one of the Mediterranean nations
of 60 million and the second country with 23% of the population over 65 years old after Japan
[5]. Italy has reported high CFR of 10.1% (8165 deaths/8053 cases) [2], while 37.8% of infected
people are between 51-70 years old and 35.8% of infected people are above 70 years old [6].
Therefore, the median age of people infected by COVID-19 is 62 years old where 57.2 % are
male and 42.8% female [6].

Results and Discussion
We chose 46 countries and 2 territories with at least one COVID-19 case confirmed in Africa by
27 March 2020 [2]. The significative difference of the young age population in Africa relatively
describes the reason for low fatality rate (Fig.1) versus Italy where COVID-19 is more fatal in
older patients [7]. During the epidemic, it’s essential to estimate the case fatality ratio [8]. The
estimation of CFR based on age profiles using data in Italy is not confidently effective to control
COVID-19 as shown in Fig 2, however the near future estimation is necessary based on actual
situation of CFR in Italy (Fig. 3) as reported 10.1% [2]. Here we propose that Africa countries
should evaluate and enforce public health measures to facilitate public health interventions and
dwindle the CFR (Fig. 3). We found that, in Italy the age profiles is the first reason which is
leading to the high CFR from COVID-19, furthermore, now Italy is classified as hyperendemic
country, the top country with antibiotics resistance deaths in Europe [9], which can be the second
reason to cause the pneumonia infection like COVID-19 to be more lethal. In turn, Africa is the
niche of two epidemics such as HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses) which weakens a
person's immune system and tuberculosis (TB) as a lung disease associated with AMR
(antimicrobial resistance) [10-12]. Those dual epidemics might worsen the situation of COVID19 in Africa. Hence, strict public health measures are required to prevent the spread of COVID19 to the people infected with HIV/TB. Africa countries with weak health care system or
deficiency of testing resources to the imported cases may arise an overestimation of the CFR to
the population in close territory or region (western, southern, northern, or central) as shown in
Table 1.

Conclusion
It is reasonable to wonder why the transmission of COVID-19 is slow in Africa, we found that
the age distribution in Africa by each country explain the low fatality rate when compared to the
age profiles in Italy. Thus, African leaders and the society should practice strict public health
measures and special attention should be oriented to elder people in Africa countries/territories including
Reunion (5.4%), Mauritius (5.1%), Tunisia (3.9%), Seychelles (3.8%) and Morocco (3.3%).

Data analysis
Data on all COVID-19 cases in Italy were obtained from the Italian National Institute of Health
(Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS) which hosting the overall information of people infected by
COVID-19 via surveillance system throughout the country [6], and African region data were
obtained from WHO coronavirus situation report [2], reported on 27 March 2020. We used R
language to estimates the fatality ratio of COVID-19 between Africa countries through various R
packages such as wpp2019 of world population data [13], tidyverse, scales and we use similar
project code with little modification [14].
