Abstract

34

As economic woes of the COVID-19 pandemic deepen, strategies are being formulated to avoid

35

the need for prolonged stay-at-home orders, while implementing risk-based quarantine, testing,

36

contact tracing and surveillance protocols. Given limited resources and the significant economic,

37

public health, and operational challenges of the current 14-day quarantine recommendation, it is

38

vital to understand if shorter but equally effective quarantine and testing strategies can be

39

deployed. To quantify the probability of post-quarantine transmission upon isolation of a positive

40

test, we developed a mathematical model in which we varied quarantine duration and the timing

41

of molecular tests for three scenarios of entry into quarantine. Specifically, we consider travel

42

quarantine, quarantine of traced contacts with an unknown time if infection, and quarantine of

43

cases with a known time of exposure. With a one-day delay between test and result, we found

44

that testing on exit (or entry and exit) can reduce the duration of a 14-day quarantine by 50%,

45

while testing on entry shortened quarantine by at most one day. Testing on exit more effectively

46

reduces post-quarantine transmission than testing upon entry. Furthermore, we identified the

47

optimal testing date within quarantines of varying duration, finding that testing on exit was most

48

effective for quarantines lasting up to seven days. As a real-world validation of these principles,

49

we analyzed the results of 4,040 SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests administered to offshore oil rig

50

employees. Among the 47 positives obtained with a testing on entry and exit strategy, 16 cases

51

that previously tested negative at entry were identified, with no further cases detected among

52

employees following quarantine exit. Moreover, this strategy successfully prevented an expected

53

nine offshore transmission events stemming from cases who had tested negative on the entry test,

54

each one a serious concern for initiating rapid spread and a disabling outbreak in the close

55

quarters of an offshore rig. This successful outcome highlights that appropriately timed testing

Introduction

60

The COVID-19 pandemic has engendered unprecedented efforts to quell ongoing outbreaks and

61

manage healthcare capacity, including strict travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders. These

62

efforts have disrupted workplaces, leading to significant and pervasive socioeconomic costs 1,2.

63

In turn, these economic pressures have led many governments and corporations to lift

64

restrictions3. Safely reopening in the absence of a vaccine relies on reducing the likelihood of an

65

infectious individual entering a workplace, school, or other social gathering 4. Current strategies

66

to ensure safety often include a 14-day quarantine—either as a consequence of travel or

67

following exposure to an infected person, as recommended by the World Health Organization

68

(WHO).5 These quarantines are sometimes combined with entry and/or exit testing, in which a

69

positive test prompts isolation until recovery.

70
71

Quarantine imposes myriad challenges for institutions of government, militaries, businesses,

72

universities, and other entities. At the individual level, the recommended 14-day quarantine

73

causes strain on mental health. 6,7 This burden is coupled with the associated economic toll and

74

potential impacts on operational integrity. For example, the typical 14-day on-and-off cycle for

75

offshore oil and gas employees is substantially disrupted when quarantine measures are required.

76

These quarantines result in prolonged time periods that crew members are away from their home.

77

Given the impact of long quarantines on mental health 6,7, we evaluated the potential that a

78

shorter quarantine combined with testing optimization could achieve reduced transmission of

79

COVID-19 within close-quarter environments where there is potentially a high risk for rapid

80

spread.

82

Evidence suggests that isolation of cases upon symptom onset is insufficient to contain an

83

outbreak of COVID-19 8. The likelihood of transmission can be reduced substantially through

84

quarantine and testing 4. Previous work has focused on the impact of quarantine and testing on

85

population-level COVID-19 incidence and deaths 9–11, shortened quarantines upon negative RT-

86

PCR test at entry from contact tracing or seven days after exposure 12 and testing measures that

87

are most appropriate for disease surveillance within a high-risk population (e.g. healthcare

88

workers) by examining various testing frequencies and their reduction of secondary infections13.

89

Currently, there is no consensus regarding the optimal duration of quarantine or timing of testing

90

that minimizes the probability of post-quarantine transmission (PQT), defined as one or more

91

infections observed after the quarantine period. Many institutions are relying on testing at entry

92

into quarantine combined with other measures such as symptom screenings, hand sanitizers, and

93

face masks to reduce the risk of an outbreak. However, the majority of COVID-19 transmission

94

is attributable to pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic cases screening for symptoms alone is

95

inadequate to prevent or interrupt a COVID-19 outbreak 8. In addition, testing too early post-

96

infection is likely to produce a false-negative result 14. Thus, symptom-based screening and one-

97

time testing could still entail a significant probability of PQT.

98
99

Some jurisdictions have suggested and implemented testing upon exit from a 14-day

100

quarantine15. For example, Australia has implemented a compulsory 14-day quarantine, with

101

testing within 48 hours after arrival and between day 10 and 12 of quarantine, to reduce

102

transmission from imported cases 16. Although these multiple tests aid in case identification, this

103

strategy does not include any reduction of the burden of long quarantine. Understanding the

104

complementarity of quarantine and testing in reducing PQT would provide vital insight into

105

effective strategies that mitigate disease spread in travel-based and contact-tracing based

106

contexts.

107
108

We applied a mathematical modeling approach to evaluate whether a less burdensome quarantine

109

and testing strategy exists that would be epidemiologically equivalent to the standard 14-day

110

quarantine protocol in reducing PQT. This model accounts for the infectivity profile of an

111

infected individual as well as the temporal diagnostic sensitivity of RT-PCR testing. Across a

112

variety of quarantine and testing scenarios, we estimated the probability of PQT for an infected

113

individual who has not manifested symptoms by the end of the quarantine period. We considered

114

three applications: (i) quarantine for travel, initiated at random times across the infectious course,

115

(ii) quarantine prompted by contact-tracing and therefore initiated early in the infectious course,

116

and (iii) quarantine when the time of exposure is known. We compared the probability of PQT

117

under three testing scenarios: (i) on entry to quarantine only, (ii) on exit from quarantine only,

118

and (iii) on both entry to and exit from quarantine for an infected individual. Across these

119

scenarios, we varied the duration of quarantine and identified the optimal testing date based on

120

that duration. As validation of our recommendations, we analyzed the real-world application of

121

our model-based findings to protocols within the oil and gas industry that prevented offshore

122

transmission.

123
124

Results

125

We derived an infectivity profile based on transmission pairs of COVID-19 infected

126

individuals 17, a basic reproduction number of R0 = 2.5, and an incubation period of 8.29 days 18,

127

and estimated the temporal diagnostic sensitivity of RT-PCR tests 19 (Table S1). Specifying

128

30.8% of infections as remaining asymptomatic across the disease course 20,21, we estimated that

129

perfect isolation of cases upon symptom onset would reduce the reproduction number to 1.6,

130

with 1.2 secondary cases occurring during the incubation period (Fig. S1A). The reproductive

131

number remained above one even when we lowered the asymptomatic proportion to 22.6% or

132

reduced R0 to 2 (Fig. S1B–D). Therefore, perfect isolation of all symptomatic individuals would

133

not be sufficient to interrupt the chain of disease transmission.

134
135

Entry into quarantine when the time of exposure is unknown

136

For settings where there is no administrative knowledge of the time of exposure such as travel

137

quarantine, we computed the expected PQT (Fig. S2) and the probability of PQT after a range of

138

quarantine durations without testing (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3A). Assuming individuals self-isolate

139

immediately upon symptom onset, the probability of PQT declines as the duration of quarantine

140

increases (Fig. 1A). This probability is less than 0.25 with a quarantine duration of at least three

141

days, and falls below 0.05 for quarantines of eight days or longer.

142
143

The impact of quarantine can be augmented through testing. We assumed a 24-hour delay

144

between the sample collection and test results, so that testing on exit occurred one day before the

145

end of quarantine. Individuals who tested positive or developed symptoms were isolated until

146

recovery. We found that any testing during quarantine contributed to a reduction in the

147

probability of PQT across the full range of quarantine duration (Fig. 1A and Fig. S3A). The

148

magnitude of this reduction was dependent on both the duration of quarantine and the timing of

149

the testing.

151

The largest reduction in the probability of PQT from conducting a single test occurred when it

152

was performed on exit for quarantines of seven days or less; on day five for quarantines lasting

153

between eight and 13 days; and on day six for quarantines that are 14 days or longer (Fig. 1B).

154

As quarantined (asymptomatic) cases proceed through their quarantine, they simultaneously

155

progress through their infectious course. Symptom onset will send a substantial fraction of

156

infected individuals to isolation and diagnostic sensitivity decreases for the remainder19, leading

157

to slightly diminishing benefits of “exit” tests performed later than day six.

158
159

Comparing the three testing strategies, we found that testing on both entry and exit from

160

quarantine provides the greatest reduction in PQT, whereas the benefit of testing at entry is

161

minimal (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3A). Testing on exit consistently and substantially outperformed testing

162

on entry across all quarantine durations considered (Fig. 1A).

163
164

We specifically compared strategies of quarantine and testing against the widely implemented

165

WHO recommendation to quarantine for 14 days (without testing) 5. In this comparison, a 13-day

166

quarantine with testing on entry, a seven-day quarantine with testing on exit, and a seven-day

167

quarantine with testing on both entry and exit each provide equivalent or lower probabilities of

168

PQT (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3).

Assessment of quarantine and testing strategies implemented for offshore facilities

171

We applied our results in the context of employees of an off-shore oil company who were

172

working a cycle of 26 days on, then 16 days off, a schedule that had been modified to make

173

efficient use of a mandatory quarantine that was implemented during the pandemic. During the

174

early stages of the epidemic, when prevalence was low, a three-day quarantine had been

175

implemented by the company in a secured facility, with testing on entry. Our risk-reduction

176

models indicated substantial marginal benefit for increasing quarantine to 5–7 days with a test on

177

exit. Testing on entry was retained for operational purposes, and testing 96 h later was initiated,

178

accompanied by expansion to a seven-day quarantine for Region A and a five-day quarantine for

179

Region B.

180
181

To assess the practical implications of our recommendations, 4040 RT-PCR tests were

182

conducted in region A and region B (serviced by different laboratories) prior to travel to offshore

183

rigs. Among these, 69 results were positive (1.7%). Of the 1792 RT-PCR tests conducted as tests

184

on entry when the initial three-day quarantine was in effect, there were 22 positive results

185

(1.2%). After advisement, Region A deployed a seven-day home quarantine for all cycles

186

starting August 13, where testing was performed on entry and exit (96 h after the first test);

187

50.0% (1/2) of the positive tests occurred on exit, following a negative test on entry (Fig. 2A).

188

Starting June 25, Region B expanded to a five-day hotel quarantine with testing on both entry

189

and 96 h after the first test. For the period in which this strategy was implemented, 33.3%

190

(15/45) of the positive tests were obtained upon the exit test, following a negative entry test

(Fig. 2B). Further validation of the entry and exit testing protocol was provided through an

192

additional 155 RT-PCR tests performed post-quarantine (11 days after the initial test) in Region

193

B, all of which were negative.

two regions where crew members were quarantined: (A) region A, with a seven-day quarantine, where
testing on entry and exit was started on August 13, and (B) region B, with a five-day quarantine, where
testing on entry and exit was started on June 25. Initially, a three-day quarantine with testing only on
entry was conducted in both regions. The vertical dashed line separates the early strategy of testing on
only entry (left) and the later strategy of testing on both entry and exit (right), including follow-up postquarantine tests conducted 11 days after the initial test (i.e., on day 12). Negative and positive

No offshore worker registering negative tests on entry and on exit from quarantine was later

197

diagnosed with COVID-19 during their offshore work. To quantify the added benefit of the test

198

at 96 h, we calculated the probability of PQT for the cases detected by this second test.

199

Compared with a three-day quarantine and testing only on entry, extending the quarantine

200

duration and adding testing on exit (96 h after the first test) reduced the probability of PQT by

201

98% for the seven-day quarantine and 93% for a five-day quarantine. If the single case identified

202

on the exit test from region A had remained undetected within the seven-day quarantine, we

203

estimate an off-shore probability of PQT of 0.13. If the 15 cases that had been ascertained on exit

204

from region B had remained undetected after the five-day quarantine without testing on exit, we

205

estimate that the probability of at least one event of PQT would have been 0.99, and would have

206

resulted in an expected 9 offshore transmission events—each one a serious concern for initiating

207

further rapid spread and a disabling outbreak in the close quarters of an offshore rig.

208
209

Accounting for prevalence of disease in the community.

210

We evaluated the impact of disease prevalence in the community on the probability of PQT

211

(Fig. S6). For a cohort of 40 individuals undergoing a five-day quarantine with prevalence of

212

1%, we estimated the probability of PQT to be 0.06 for testing only on entry, and 0.005 for

213

testing on both entry and exit (Fig. S6B). For a seven-day quarantine and the same prevalence,

214

the probability of PQT drops from 0.02 for testing only on entry to 0.001 when augmented with

215

testing on exit (Fig. S6C).

216
217

Contrasting contact tracing and uniform entry into quarantine

218

Contact tracing is ideally initiated following identification of a positive case either by symptom

219

presentation or by surveillance screening through testing. We evaluated the impact of quarantine

220

initiated through contact tracing on reducing PQT under scenarios of no delay (Fig. 3A, Fig. S7–

221

S8) or one-day delay in outreach to exposed contacts (Fig. S9–S10). Tracing of contacts was

222

assumed to be initiated by the onset of relevant COVID-19 symptoms. Rapid contact tracing

223

results in the quarantine of infected contacts early in their infection course, thereby increasing

224

the recommended duration of quarantine and changing the relationship between test timing and

225

the probability of PQT, compared to uniform entry into quarantine (Fig. 3A vs Fig. 1A).

227

However, the combination of shorter quarantines with exit testing maintains high effectiveness

228

compared with 14-day quarantines without testing. When cases are identified through contact

229

tracing, we found that a seven-day quarantine with testing on exit and a six-day quarantine with

230

testing on entry and exit each result in an probability of PQT equivalent or lower than a 14-day

231

quarantine with no testing; testing on entry bestowed only trivial benefit (Fig. 3A, Fig. S8). For

232

quarantines of seven days or less, the optimal test timing was upon exit. For quarantines beyond

233

seven days, the optimal timing was day six (Fig. 3B).

236

Optimal day of testing for a known time of exposure

237

When a specific date of exposure can be identified for a traced contact, the optimal test timing

238

differs from that calculated by integrating over all possible exposure times. When quarantined

239

one day post-infection and tested on entry, an additional test on day six of quarantine is optimal;

240

the optimal day of testing then decreases linearly. For an individual entering quarantine seven or

241

more days post-infection, the optimal test date is the test on entry (Fig. 4).

245

We performed a comparative analysis specifying a latent period that is one day greater or lesser

246

than the reported 2.9 days 22. The expected number of secondary cases occurring before

247

symptom onset was similar among the different latent periods (1.21 infection for a latent period

248

2.9 days; 1.24 infections for a latent period of 1.9 days; and 1.27 infections for a latent period of

249

3.9 days). The infectivity profiles differed among the three latent periods, with a peak infectivity

250

that is higher for both the 1.9-day and 3.9-day latent periods when compared to our baseline

251

(Fig. S11).

252
253

For quarantine periods of at least seven days and individuals entering quarantine uniformly

254

across the time course of infection (Fig. S12–S15), the probability of PQT was lower for shorter

255

latent periods. For shorter quarantines, the relationship between the probability of PQT and latent

256

period is more intricate. For traced contacts entering quarantines of eight days or longer

257

(Fig. S16–S19), shorter latent periods entailed lower probability of PQT. For traced contacts

258

entering quarantines of fewer than eight days, the relationship of latent period to probability of

259

PQT is more complex. However, one-day changes in the latent period affect the optimal day to

260

conduct a single test by at most one day (Fig. S4). Specifically, we found that a 3.9-day latent

261

period decreased the optimal day of testing estimated for a 2.9-day latent period, whereas a 1.9-

262

day latent period increased the best day to conduct a single test.

263
264

For our analysis of potential outbreaks consequent to offshore-rig quarantine and testing, we

265

analysed sensitivity of our result to the proportion of asymptomatic individuals on the probability

266

of PQT (Fig. S5). We found that the estimated probability of PQT using the strategy of testing

upon entry and at 96 h moderately increased if a higher proportion of infections were expected to

268

be asymptomatic (Fig. S5).

Discussion

271

Here, we derived theory to calculate the probability of post-quarantine transmission of COVID-

272

19 for a wide range of durations of quarantine, supplemented by testing on entry to quarantine,

273

on exit from quarantine, or both. For quarantines with durations of up to seven days, we found

274

that testing on exit provided the greatest marginal benefit in terms of reducing the probability of

275

PQT. Testing on entry provided modest benefits in combination with quarantine or with testing

276

on exit. For a quarantine with a duration longer than seven days, the optimal testing time is on

277

day five or six. Optimal testing times were fairly consistent between travel quarantines and

278

quarantines of traced contacts, differing at most by a day. The benefits of testing later in

279

quarantine were demonstrated by test results of oil crewmembers heading offshore that

280

identified 16 cases testing negative on entry and positive on exit that could easily have resulted

281

in costly and logistically difficult-to-handle offshore outbreaks. When the time of exposure is

282

known, the optimal day for a test for quarantines of a week or more starts at day six of the

283

quarantine, decreasing linearly to day-of-entry for individuals who have been infected for seven

284

or more days. It may seem counter-intuitive that the optimal test for so many identified timings

285

of exposure is on entry, yet testing on entry has so much less impact than testing on exit when

286

the date of exposure is unknown. Indeed, for individuals that are tested after the incubation

287

period (e.g. later than symptom onset), the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR test has started

288

to decline. However, for individuals late in disease, there is also far less infectivity left in their

289

disease course. The high remaining infectivity of individuals early in disease course markedly

290

outweighs the low infectivity of individuals late in disease course in influencing the optimal day

291

of testing to prevent post-quarantine transmission.

292
293

An outbreak can be triggered or sustained within an environment that is monitored only for

294

symptoms of COVID-19. Quarantining individuals before returning to work or school has been a

295

common strategy among many businesses, the military and universities to prevent potential

296

outbreaks 23,24. An offshore or military setting is one of numerous close-quarters environments in

297

modern society where an outbreak can seriously impact operational integrity, leading to

298

compromised safety and adverse economic consequences. Hence, minimizing outbreak risk

299

while maintaining staffing is critical. Testing may allow for the quarantine duration to be

300

reduced without increasing the risk of PQT. For example, many universities have implemented

301

plans for quarantining and frequent testing of students and employees, where resources allow

302

25,26

303

substantially greater issue for operational integrity than false positives. Consistent with the

304

results from our analytic model (Fig. 1A and Fig. 3A), simulations from a recent agent-based

305

model suggest that testing on exit—or entry and exit—of a seven-day quarantine can avert

306

similar transmission as a 14-day quarantine with no transmission 12. Our results show that

307

testing upon entry to quarantine carries such a risk of false negatives, as infected individuals who

308

enter quarantine very early in the incubation period of disease may not be detected due to low

309

viral loads.

. For businesses and close-quarters environments, the impact of false negatives is a

310
311

Our estimates for the probability of PQT for the various strategies were estimated assuming a

312

basic reproductive number of 2.5 throughout the disease course, and unchanged post-quarantine.

313

In the offshore environment, individuals are living in very confined quarters which could lead to

314

higher post-quarantine transmission and a larger number of secondary infections. In some

315

community settings, the number of secondary infections can be reduced through mask-wearing,

316

social distancing, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. These changes in the number of

317

secondary infections post-quarantine can markedly influence the probability of PQT. However,

318

they would not affect the relative benefit of testing on exit compared to entry. Therefore, our

319

qualitative finding of the optimality of testing later in quarantine than on entry are robust to

320

settings with extensive post-quarantine transmission.

321
322

As prevalence in the general community increases (Fig. S6, blue and purple), there are benefits

323

to conducting additional tests during quarantine: as substantial numbers of infected individuals

324

enter quarantine, larger numbers of individuals may proceed through testing with rare false-

325

negative test results, increasing PQT. Addressing false negatives that inevitably occur at high

326

prevalence can be aided by performing additional tests during quarantine; the impact of any

327

specific set of tests can be quantified within our model framework. In future research, the theory

328

can be applied to evaluate the impact of incorporating recent innovations such as saliva RT-PCR

329

tests and rapid antigen tests. These alternate approaches could exhibit altered optima. We have

330

not quantified more extensive testing strategies here due to the limited availability of testing,

331

potentially high and largely unknown correlations among false-negative test results for

332

individual cases, and the observed moderate marginal benefit of additional testing performed in

333

early stages of disease with lower detection rates (Fig. S28).

335

Optimal timing of limited testing during quarantine improves the ability to control PQT. Testing

336

several days into quarantine increases the likelihood of an infected case testing positive

337

(Fig. S4). The increasing diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is attributable to the rapidly

338

increasing viral load following the less detectable latent stage of infection. If the infected

339

individual remains asymptomatic, testing near the end of a standard 14-day quarantine can also

340

lead to low diagnostic sensitivity due to a declining viral load as they overcome the infection 27.

341

Australia has implemented a mandatory 14-day quarantine for individuals arriving into the

342

country, with testing during the first two days of arrival and between day 10 and 12 of

343

quarantine 16. Though the differences are moderate, our analysis indicates that the lowest

344

probability of PQT is achieved by testing on day six of the standard 14-day quarantine (Fig. 1B,

345

Fig 3B).

346
347

Testing was found to result in a smaller reduction of the expected PQT when cases enter

348

quarantine through contact tracing compared to when they enter as a consequence of travel

349

regulation. Contact tracing will usually identify more infected cases per quarantined individual

350

than will travel quarantine, due to the specific exposure risk. For example, if prevalence is 1%

351

and 10 individuals are selected at random for quarantine, then on average 0.1 people would be

352

infected. Alternatively, if an index case is isolated upon symptom onset, there would be on

353

average 1.21 individuals infected (for an R0 = 2.5) prior to symptom onset and potentially

354

identified through contact tracing. With a significant chance of traced contacts being infected,

355

reducing PQT becomes increasingly important. However, traced contacts are likely to enter

356

quarantine earlier in disease (Fig. S31). Such an earlier entry necessitates a consequently longer

20

357

quarantine (generally). Earlier entry makes it more likely that testing early in quarantine will

358

occur during the latent period, when diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is highly limited.

359
360

Our study is informative for businesses, military operations, and universities, providing

361

quantitative estimation of the residual risk of PQT. The calculated infection risks were used to

362

inform the quarantine and RT-PCR testing strategy deployed by an oil and gas company prior to

363

workers travelling offshore. Of the positive tests obtained under this strategy, 34% were obtained

364

on an exit test following a negative entry test. The exit test prevented 16 infected crew members

365

from exiting quarantine and entering confined quarters offshore while potentially infectious. The

366

results of the time of testing for a given quarantine duration are also useful for public-health

367

decision making when quarantine is required for international, interstate, and social travel.

368
369

Our examination of the effects of durations of quarantine and timings of testing is critical to

370

future efforts to balance the risk of PQT with the economic costs, negative impact on mental

371

health, and restrictions on social liberty associated with prolonged quarantines. Timely testing

372

enables a shorter quarantine with equivalent benefits to the much longer 14-day quarantine in

373

prevention of post-quarantine transmission. Our study indicates that the strategy of testing upon

374

entry into quarantine—currently implemented by many institutions and administrative bodies—

375

conveys the least benefit, if infection time is unknown. Testing at exit can provide substantially

376

higher dividends in reducing PQT; or at an optimal timing near 1 week for quarantines of a

377

week or longer. Our result was substantiated both by our integrative analysis of infectivity and

378

diagnostic sensitivity, and by test results demonstrating the utility of tests 96 h into the

379

quarantine of crew members of an offshore oil facility. In determining policies for the duration of

Data of SARS CoV-2 tests during quarantine

388

Between April 11, 2020 and August 26, 2020, there were 4,040 SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR tests

389

conducted among employees of an oil and gas company coming from two regions (stratified by

390

lab location). A third region that was monitored is not included in our data set, as there was low

391

population prevalence entering quarantine and there were no positive tests. During the early

392

stages of the epidemic, both regions used a three-day quarantine with testing on entry. On

393

August 13, employees from region A quarantined at home for seven days, with testing occurring

394

on both entry and exit. While employees were at home, they were asked to practice social

395

distancing in public. Starting on June 25, employees from region B were quarantined in a hotel

396

for five days prior to their departure offshore and tested on both entry and exit. The requirements

397

of an employee to go off-shore were (1) passing the components of a screening form used to

398

filter out symptomatic cases and those potentially exposed, (2) temperature screenings, and (3)

399

completion of the quarantine with no positive RT-PCR test. Upon a positive test, the employee

400

initiated a 14-day isolation period and followed through the company's case management

401

process. After the isolation period, individuals were able to return back to work contingent upon

402

two negative RT-PCR tests. The use of this data was approved by the Human Participants

Epidemiological parameters

407

The average incubation period is 8.29 days 18. The latent period (i.e. infected but low probability

408

of infecting contacts) is 2.9 days 22. We consider latent periods of 1.9 days and 3.9 days in a

409

scenario analysis 22 (Fig. S11–S19).

410
411

For our baseline analysis, we considered a delay of one day between sample collection and result

412

of RT-PCT test. Thus, the sample is taken one day before the end of quarantine when testing on

413

exit. We also conducted the analysis when there was no delay in testing results to examine the

414

impact on the probability of PQT (Fig. S20–S23).

415
416

In the baseline analysis, we assumed R0 = 2.5 and 30.8% of infections are asymptomatic 8,20. We

417

further analyzed the scenario in which 22.6% of infections are asymptomatic (Fig S24–S27) 28.

418

Both of these proportions are consistent with estimates from a systematic meta-analysis 21.

419

Asymptomatic infections were assumed to be equally as infectious as symptomatic infections.

420

This assumption is based on measurements of viral loads in asymptomatic infections being

421

comparable to those observed in symptomatic cases 29,30.

422
423

Infectivity profile

424

The infectivity profile has been determined to increase rapidly prior to symptom onset, peak near

425

onset of symptoms, and decrease subsequently 31. We specified our infectivity profiles based on

426

the full dataset and R code provided by He et al 17, specifying the latent period. The infectivity

427

during the latent period was expressed as exponentially lower (Supplementary Information:

428

Methods, Infectivity function). Imposing the strict threshold where 20 days after symptom

429

onset infectivity is zero 32–34 made no significant difference to our estimate of PQT for

430

quarantines of up to 14 days .

431
432

Temporal diagnostic sensitivity of a SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay

433

We utilized the post-symptom onset temporal diagnostic sensitivity for RT-PCR tests of infected

434

individuals 19, fitting a logistic regression function to the diagnostic sensitivity data from zero to

435

25 days post-symptom onset through minimization of least squares. To infer the diagnostic

436

sensitivity prior to symptom onset, we first used this function to perform a slight extrapolation of

437

the diagnostic sensitivity back to the peak, which occurred slightly prior to symptom onset.

438

Second, to determine the diagnostic sensitivity for the remaining portion of the incubation

439

period, we specified the interpolation function determined by the infectivity and the diagnostic

440

sensitivity from post-symptom onset, and used that interpolation function on the pre-symptom

441

onset infectivity to determine pre-symptom onset diagnostic sensitivity (Supplementary

442

Information: Methods, Diagnostic sensitivity function). This process provides the diagnostic

443

sensitivity over the entire course of infection (Fig. S28)13. We assumed that the specificity of the

444

RT-PCR assay was 100% 35.

445
446

Probability of post-quarantine transmission

447

To calculate the probability of PQT—defined to be the probability of at least one post-quarantine

448

infection—we assumed that the expected post-quarantine transmission is described by a negative

449

binomial distribution with a dispersion parameter of 0.25 36. This value for the dispersion

450

parameter is consistent with numerous published estimates 37–39. For sensitivity analyses, we also

451

computed the probability of PQT given Poisson-distributed post-quarantine transmission

452

(Fig. S29–S30). In our additional analysis accounting for the underlying prevalence within the

453

community, the probability of PQT was defined as the likelihood that at least one infected

454

individual in a cohort became a source of PQT. Similarly, to calculate the probability of PQT

455

given a negative test on entry for N infected individuals, we estimated the probability that at least

456

one of the cases contributed to PQT.

Theory

Transmission over Time
Transmission of a pathogen from an infected individual is typically time-dependent, based
on pathogen shedding and behavioral changes, and can be represented over time by a function
𝑟(𝑡), for which time t = 0 represents initial infection. To represent infectiousness, a function 𝑟(𝑡)
can be scaled such that
∞
(1)
∫𝑡 = 0 𝑟(𝑡)𝘥𝑡 = 𝑅0 ,
where 𝑅0 is the basic reproduction number: the expected number of infections consequent to a
single infected individual under a scenario of no intervention. Specifying a discrete end to the
infection at time 𝑡𝑒 such that 𝑟(𝑡 ) = 0 for 𝑡 > 𝑡𝑒 ,
𝑡

𝑒
∫𝑡 = 0 𝑟(𝑡)𝘥𝑡 = 𝑅0 .

Infectiousness during discrete timespans 𝑡2 − 𝑡1 (e.g. days) can be calculated as
𝑡

𝑅𝑡2−𝑡1 = ∫𝑡 =2 𝑡 𝑟(𝑡)𝘥𝑡.
1

Self-isolation at Symptom Onset
A significant means of intervention to prevent infection is self-isolation of infected
individuals upon symptom onset. The expected effect on onward transmission of an intervention
such as self-isolation of a case that becomes symptomatic at time 𝑡𝑠 can be calculated as
𝑡

𝑅𝑖 = ∫𝑡 =𝑠 0 𝑟(𝑡)𝘥𝑡,

(2)
𝑡

provided that all individuals self-isolate upon presentation with symptoms. If ∫𝑡 =𝑠 0 𝑟(𝑡)𝘥𝑡 > 1,
then even perfect self-isolation upon symptom onset will be insufficient to extinguish disease
transmission. We express the transmission over time for a symptomatic individual who isolates
upon symptom onset as

If the outcome of infections leads to a proportion of infected individuals 𝑝𝑎 that can infect
others but that never manifest symptoms (i.e. that are asymptomatic carriers), then transmission
may be partitioned into the contributions of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases as 𝑅0 =
𝑅0,𝑠 𝑝𝑠 + 𝑅0,𝑎 𝑝𝑎 , in which the probability of a symptomatic case 𝑝𝑠 = (1 − 𝑝𝑎 ). 𝑅0,𝑠 and 𝑅0,𝑎 can
be equated to distinct infectiousness functions 𝑟𝑠 (𝑡) and 𝑟𝑎 (𝑡), in the absence of self-isolation.
For simplicity of presentation in ensuing theory, it will be assumed that 𝑅0,𝑠 = 𝑅0,𝑎 and the same
infectivity profile in the absence of self-isolation (i.e. 𝑟𝑠 (𝑡) = 𝑟𝑠 (𝑡) = 𝑟(𝑡)) 1,2. Alternate overall
transmission and alternate forms of infectivity over time for asymptomatic cases may easily be
partitioned and tracked in the theory that follows should there be evidence to substantiate their
difference.
The presence of asymptomatic carriers increases the degree of transmission consequent to a
self-isolation intervention from that shown by Eq. 2 to
𝑡

𝑅 = 𝑝𝑠 ∫𝑡 =𝑠 0 𝑟𝑆 (𝑡)𝘥𝑡 + 𝑝𝑎 𝑅0 .

Quarantine
Quarantine with a Known Time of Infection. A longstanding approach to limit disease
spread is the quarantine of individuals who have no prior indication of potential for disease but
intend to migrate from a population in which there is current transmission to a population with
lower or zero disease prevalence. Because quarantined individuals experience a significant
restriction of personal freedom, it is important to minimize the duration of quarantine 𝑞, but also
maximize its effectiveness in limiting post-quarantine transmission. Quarantine of q days from

For policy decision-making regarding quarantine duration, the expected post-quarantine
transmission is typically most important, and can be calculated as
∞

𝑅𝑞⟼ = ∫𝑡 = 𝑡

𝑞 +𝑞

𝑟(𝑡)𝘥𝑡.

If individuals self-isolate, there is a trivial case in which 𝑡𝑠 ≤ 𝑡𝑞 + 𝑞 and 𝑅𝑞⟼ = 0; otherwise,

Unfortunately, these expressions are unlikely to be useful in this form for quantifying the
benefits of quarantine in reducing transmission. In the case of quarantine of migrants from one
population to another, the time of infection—and correspondingly the time of quarantine 𝑡𝑞 —are
rarely known.
Quarantine with an Unknown Time of Infection. In a rapidly spreading epidemic,
individuals who might be entering quarantine will tend to be early in disease time course. In a
rapidly declining epidemic, individuals who might be entering quarantine will tend to be later in

from t0 to ts such that individuals entering quarantine are evenly distributed across the disease
time course. Provided all individuals experience symptoms at time 𝑡𝑠 that qualify them for
isolation instead of quarantine, then the expected post-quarantine infectivity is

A similar approach that incorporates symptomatic and asymptomatic cases by their proportions
within the population may be performed throughout the rest of the scenarios below, and will not
be specifically pointed out for each scenario.

Testing
Testing with a Known Time of Infection. Diagnostic test sensitivity 𝑠(𝑡) is also timedependent. Assaying for components of the pathogen (e.g. DNA, RNA, or protein), diagnostic
sensitivity typically is zero to low very early in disease before the pathogen load burgeons, then
declines in the later stages of disease when immune responses develop and infection is
suppressed (Fig. S28). In a disease for which tests can diagnose infections during the incubation
phase, testing can enhance the efficacy of quarantine by identifying individuals to be isolated
instead of quarantined, thereby preventing future transmission from cases that persist as
infectious through an earlier exit from quarantine than would be called for in case isolation.

Contact Tracing
Tracing of individuals who have had contact with an index case identifies persons whose
quarantine would reduce the risk of disease transmission from recently exposed individuals.
When an individual is identified as a contact of an index case, the expected time of infection is
not the same as that of an individual selected at random from an infected population. Restricting
our attention to transmissions occurring between an index case and their contacts, there are four
nominal transmission relationships to be considered, of which three are considered relevant to an
attentive program of contact tracing and quarantine (Table S2): the asymptomatic or presymptomatic contact may have infected the index case, or may have been infected by the index
case. Here we excluded from calculation the case in which a pre-symptomatic individual infects
the index case, because that scenario is formally impossible with a fixed 𝑡𝑠 and rigorous selfisolation and self-identification upon symptoms, and unlikely even with variable 𝑡𝑠 and
imperfect adherence to self-isolation and self-identification.

Continuing our assumption that individuals are assiduously self-isolating upon symptom onset
𝑡

and recalling that 𝑅𝑖 = ∫𝑡 =𝑠 0 𝑟𝑆 (𝑡)𝘥𝑡 (Eq. 2), we can tabulate the expected transmission by
contacts of the index that are classified into three kinds (Table S3). By assumption, a contact to
become symptomatic could not have infected the index case, because otherwise in an assiduously
self-isolating population, that contact would have been the index case.

Probability of post-quarantine transmission
The probability of post-quarantine transmission is specified to be the probability that an
infected individual exits quarantine, but can still infect one or more individuals. We calculated
this probability under a negative-binomial model appropriate when superspreaders play a role in
transmission, as well as a Poisson distribution appropriate when transmission is fairly evenly
distributed among infected individuals.
Negative-binomial distribution. We specified a negative binomial distribution

,such that the average of the distribution

was 𝑅𝑞⟼ (𝑞). Thus, the corresponding probability of post-quarantine transmission with negative
binomially-distributed transmissions from a case is
𝑃(𝑞) = 1 − 𝑓(0|𝑘, 𝑝).
Poisson distribution. Specifying a Poisson distribution producing an expected number of
secondary infections post-quarantine transmission of 𝑅𝑞⟼ (𝑞), the probability of transmission
after a quarantine of duration q days
𝑃(𝑞) = 1 − 𝑒 −𝑅𝑞⟼ (𝑞) .

Population prevalence
Given a cohort size N and a prevalence of 𝜌, the probability of post-quarantine transmission
is 1 − (1 − 𝑃(𝑞))𝑁𝜌 .

Methods
Infectivity function. We use a Gamma function to specify the infectivity over the disease
time course (Fig. S1 and Fig. S11). We generated the infectivity profile during the presymptomatic phase for each duration of the pre-symptomatic period corresponding to each latent
period, using the R code provided from He et al 4. However, as a matter of accounting for the full
disease time course, a level of infectivity during the latent period prior to the discrete onset of the
distribution provided by He et al must also be specified. Therefore, we specified the infectivity
during this early period of infection as 𝐴(𝑒 𝑚⋅(𝑡) − 1), where the constants m and A are estimated

such that the infectivity function r(t) is smooth and continuous over the entire disease time
course. Since the infectivity profile after the latent stage is described by a Gamma function
(which has an initial value of zero), we truncate the exponential function at time tL + Δt, where tL
is the duration of the latent period; Δt was set as the difference between tL and the upper bound
of tL (where the difference in the log-likelihood at tL and at tL + Δt was 1.96 5).
Diagnostic sensitivity function. To characterize the diagnostic sensitivity post-symptom
onset, we estimated the coefficients of a logistic regression model

where 𝑠̃ 𝑖 denotes the observed diagnostic sensitivity at day i post-symptom onset. The peak
infectivity occurs prior to symptom onset from the inferred infectivity curves 4, implying that the
infectivity curve is monotonically decreasing over time after symptom onset. To be consistent,
the sensitivity should also be monotonically decreasing over time after symptom onset as
infectivity (a proxy for the viral load) is decreasing. Therefore, a constraint that the maximum
sensitivity after symptom onset occurred at time zero was included in the estimation of the
coefficients of the logistic regression model.
To select the number of coefficients in the logistic regression model, we used the Akaike
information criterion,
AIC= 2(𝑁 + 1) + 26 𝑙𝑛 (𝑅𝑆𝑆),

where there are N + 1 coefficients being estimated for the 26 data points. The logistic regression
model with the lowest AIC value was used to determine the diagnostic sensitivity.

We used diagnostic test-sensitivity data from zero to 25 days post-symptom onset 6 and the
infectivity profile post-symptom onset 4 to construct a mapping from infectivity to diagnostic
sensitivity, then used that mapping to infer the diagnostic sensitivity during the incubation period
from the infectivity pre-symptom onset. To infer the diagnostic sensitivity during the unobserved
incubation period, we defined an interpolation function for the diagnostic sensitivity based on the
Cartesian pairing of r(t) and s(t) from symptom onset. Since the peak of infectivity occurred
prior to symptom onset, we performed a slight extrapolation of the function s(t) determined by
logistic regression. This extrapolation lies within a small range between the symptom-onset
diagnostic sensitivity of 0.96 and an upper limit of 1.0 for each latent period considered, so that
our results are not sensitive to this extrapolation.

Figure S19: For durations of quarantine from 1–21 days, when an individual enters quarantine
through contact tracing, with an incubation period of 8.29 days, a latent period of 3.9 days, with
30.8% of infections being asymptomatic, and perfect self-isolation of symptomatic infections, (A) the
probability of post-quarantine transmission (probability of one or more post-quarantine infections)
with no testing, when tested upon entry to quarantine, when tested on exit from quarantine, and
when tested on entry and exit from quarantine, and (B) the durations of quarantine with testing on
entry, testing on exit, and testing on entry and exit that perform just as well or better than a
quarantine with no testing. Because of the time required to obtain test results, sampling for the test
on exit is assumed to occur the day before the quarantine is complete. Cells that share a background
color in common indicate equivalent durations of quarantine associated with each of the testing
strategies.
