Abstract
The basic reproduction number, R0, determines the rate of spread of a communicable disease and
therefore gives fundamental information needed to plan public health interventions. Using
mortality records, we estimated the rate of spread of COVID-19 among 160 counties and countyaggregates in the USA. Here, we show that most of the high among-county variance is
explainable by four factors (R2 = 0.70): the timing of outbreak, population size, population
density, and spatial location. For predictions of future spread, population density and spatial
location are important, and for the latter we show that SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the G614
mutation to the spike gene are associated with higher rates of spread. Finally, the high
predictability of R0 allows extending estimates to all 3109 counties in the conterminous 48 states.
The high variation of R0 argues for public health policies enacted at the county level for
controlling COVID-19.

Introduction
The basic reproduction number, R0, is the number of secondary infections produced per
primary infection of a disease in a susceptible population, and it is a fundamental metric in
epidemiology that gauges, among other factors, the initial rate of disease spread during an
epidemic1. While R0 depends in part on the biological properties of the pathogen, it also depends
on properties of the host population such as the contact rate between individuals1,2. Estimates of
R0 are required for designing public health interventions for infectious diseases such as COVID19: for example, R0 determines in large part the proportion of a population that must be
vaccinated to control a disease3,4. Because R0 at the start of an epidemic measures the spread rate
under "normal" conditions without interventions, these initial R0 values can inform policies to
allow life to get "back to normal."
The estimates of R0 before intervention determine the intensity with which public health
interventions must be applied, and the risk and magnitude of potential resurgent outbreaks. In
these contexts, R0 is a reference against which the success or failure of public interventions can
be assessed. Using R0 estimates to design public health policies is predicated on the assumption
that the R0 values at the start of the epidemic reflect properties of the infective agent and
population, and therefore predict the potential rate of spread of the disease. Estimates of R0,
however, might not predict future risks if (i) they are measured after public and private actions
have been taken to reduce spread5,6, (ii) they are driven by stochastic events, such as superspreading7,8, or (iii) they are driven by social or environmental conditions that are likely to
change between the time of initial epidemic and the future time for which public health
interventions are designed9,10. To address these potential limitations for using R0 to design public
health policies and future risks of spread, we investigated possible underlying causes for

variation in estimates of R0 among counties: if the causes are unlikely to change in the future,
then so too are values of R0 unlikely to change.
Policies to manage for COVID-19 in the USA are set by a mix of jurisdictions from state
to local levels. We estimated R0 at the county level both to match policymaking and to account
for possibly large variation in R0 among counties. To estimate R0, we performed the analyses on
the number of daily COVID-19 deaths11. We used death count rather than infection case reports,
because we suspected the proportion of reported deaths due to COVID-19 is less sensitive to
variation in testing rates and methods. We recognize that some deaths due to COVID-19 will go
unreported (e.g., the growing evidence from "excess deaths"12) and that different counties and
states may use different criteria for determining the cause of death as COVID-19. Nonetheless,
due to the mathematical structure of our estimation procedure, unreported deaths due to COVID19 and differences among counties in reporting criteria will have little effect on our estimates of
R0; specifically, the estimates of R0 for a given county will not change provided the proportion of
unreported deaths in a county does not change through time. We analyzed data for counties that
had at least 100 reported cumulative deaths (Methods), and for other counties we aggregated data
within the same state including deaths whose county was unknown. This led to 160 final time
series representing counties in 39 states and the District of Columbia, of which 36 were
aggregated at the state level. Some states, even after aggregating data from all counties, did not
reach the 100-threshold of cumulative deaths, and therefore the spread rate for these states was
not estimated.
We found high variance in the spread rate of COVID-19 among counties, most of which
is explained by four factors: the timing of the county-level outbreak, population size, population
density, and spatial location. Population density is likely an indicator of the average contact rate

among people, and its explanatory power in the statistical model makes it an important predictor
of future spread. Spatial location is also important, and we show that some of the effect of spatial
location could be caused by differences among strains of SARS-CoV-2 that dominated in
different parts of the USA. Using the statistical model, we estimated R0 at the county level for
the entire conterminous USA, giving information to design public health policies for controlling
COVID-19.

Results
Estimates of the spread rate
Before estimating R0, we first estimated the rate of spread of the virus-caused COVID-19
as the rate of increase of the daily death counts, r0. Although this approach is not typically used
in epidemiological studies, it has the advantage of being statistically robust even when the data
(death counts) are low, and it makes the minimum number of assumptions that could affect the
estimates in unexpected ways (Supplementary Methods: Overview of Statistical Methods). We
applied a time-varying autoregressive state-space model to each time series of death counts13. In
contrast to other models of COVID-19 epidemics14,15, we do not incorporate the transmission
process and the daily time course of transmission, but instead we estimate the time-varying
exponential change in the number of deaths per day, r(t). Detailed simulation analyses
(Supplementary Methods: Simulation model) showed that estimates of r(t) generally lagged
behind the true values. Therefore, we analyzed the time series in forward and reverse directions,
and averaged to get the estimates of r0 at the start of the time series (Supplementary Fig. S1); this
approach counterbalances the lag in the forward direction with the lag in the backwards
direction, therefore reducing the lag effect. The model was fit accounting for greater uncertainty

when mortality counts were low, and confidence intervals of the estimates were obtained from
parametric bootstrapping, which is the most robust approach when counts are low. Thus, our
strategy was to use a parsimonious model to give robust estimates of r0 even for counties that
had experienced relatively few deaths, and then calculate R0 from r0 after the fitting process
using well-established methods16.
Our r0 estimates ranged from close to zero for several counties to 0.33 for New York City
(five boroughs); the latter implies that the number of deaths increases by a factor of e0.33 = 1.39
per day. There were highly statistically significant differences between upper and lower
estimates (Fig. 1). Although our time series approach allowed us to estimate r0 at the start of
even small epidemics, we anticipated two factors that could potentially affect our estimates of r0
that are not likely to be useful in explaining future spread rates. The first factor is the timing of
the onset of county-level epidemic: 35% of the local outbreaks started after the declaration of
COVID-19 as a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March, 202017, and thus we anticipated estimates
of r0 to decrease with the Julian date of outbreak onset. Change in human behaviors caused by
public awareness about COVID-19 at the outbreak onset will not necessarily predict future rates
of spread. We used the second factor, the size of the population encompassed by the time series,
to factor out statistical bias from the time series analyses. Simulation studies showed that
estimates for time series with low death counts were downward biased (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Because for a given spread rate r(t) the total number of deaths in a time series should be
proportional to the population size, we used population size as a covariate to remove bias. In
addition to these two factors that we do not think have strong predictive value for the future rate
of spread, we also anticipated effects of population density and spatial autocorrelation.
Therefore, we regressed r0 against outbreak onset, population size and population density, and

included spatially autocorrelated error terms.

Explaining variation in r0
The regression analysis showed highly significant effects of all four factors (Table 1), and
each factor had a substantial partial R2pred18. The overall R2pred was 0.70, so most of the countyto-county variance was explained. We calculated corrected r0 values, factoring out outbreak
onset and population size, by standardizing the r0 values to 11 March, 2020, and to the most
populous county (for which the estimates of r0 are likely best). Counties with low to medium
population density never had high corrected r0 values, suggesting that population density sets an
upper limit on the rate of spread of COVID-19 (Fig. 2A), in agreement with expectations and
published results1,19. Nonetheless, despite the unequivocal statistical effect of population density
(P < 10–8, Table 1), the explanatory power was not high in comparison to the entire model
(partial R2pred = 0.14), probably because population density at the scale of counties will be only
roughly related to contact rates among people. The contact rates will likely depend on a wide
variety of factors, such as transmission through schools, social gatherings, and nursing homes.
Spatial autocorrelation had strong power in explaining variation in r0 among counties
(partial R2pred = 0.48, Table 1) and occurred at the scale of hundreds of kilometers (Fig. 2B). This
spatial autocorrelation might reflect differences in public responses to COVID-19 across the
USA not captured by the variable in the regression model for outbreak onset. For example,
Seattle, WA, reported the first positive case in the USA, on 15 January, 2020, and there was a
public response before deaths were recorded20. In contrast, the response in New York City was
delayed, even though the outbreak occurred later than in Seattle21. Spatial autocorrelation could
also be caused by movement of infected individuals. However, movement would only lead to

autocorrelation in our regression analysis if many of the reported deaths were of people infected
outside the county; while some deaths were likely caused by infections from outside counties,
privacy restrictions on case data make these data hard to obtain, and we assume that such deaths
are a small proportion of the total. A further possibility is that spatial variation in the rate of
spread of COVID-19 reflects spatial variation in the occurrence of different genetic strains of
SARS-CoV-2.
To investigate whether spatial autocorrelation could potentially be caused by different
strains of SARS-CoV-2 differing in transmissibility, we analyzed publicly available information
about genomic sequences from the GISAID metadata22. Scientific debate has focused on the role
of the G614 mutation in the spike protein gene (D614G) to increase the rate of transmission of
SARS-CoV-223. We therefore asked whether the proportion of strains containing the G614
mutation was associated with higher rates of COVID-19 spread. Because the genomic samples
are only located to the state level, we performed the analysis accordingly, for each state selecting
the r0 from the county or county-aggregate with the highest number of deaths (and hence being
most likely represented in the genomic samples). We further restricted genomic samples to those
collected within 30 days following the outbreak onset we used to select the data for time-series
analyses, and we required at least five genomic samples per state. This data handling resulted in
28 states available for analysis. We again used our regression model (Eq. 3), now including the
proportion of strains having the G614 mutation instead of spatial location. The proportion of
samples containing the G614 mutation had a positive effect on r0 (P = 0.016, Table S2). The low
proportion of strains containing the G614 mutation in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast
were associated with lower values of r0 (Fig. 3). Before analyzing the full GISAID data, we
analyzed a subset from Nextstrain24 naïvely, without engaging the specific hypothesis that the

G614 mutation increased transmission. This naïve analysis picked strain 19B as having a lower
transmission rate than other strains (P = 0.014, Supplementary Methods: Analysis of Nextstrain
metadata of SARS-CoV-2 strains). Strain 19B does not have the G614 mutation, although strain
19A (also without the G614 mutation) did not have lower transmission than G614-containing
strains, suggesting possible differences among strains separate from or in addition to the G614
mutation25.
Higher transmissibility of strains containing the G614 mutation is also suggested by its
increasing prevalence in strains in the USA26. Nonetheless, our analyses give no information
about the mechanisms explaining differences in spread rates among strains. A consensus on the
potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is still lacking23: some studies present evidence for a
differential pathogenicity and transmissibility27,28, while others conclude that mutations might be
mostly neutral or even reduce transmissibility29. Our analyses call for further investigation to
better understand the potential link between viral genomic variation and its impact on
transmission and mortality30.
To check whether there are other factors that might explain variation in our estimates of
r0 among counties, we investigated additional population characteristics31-38 that might be
expected to affect the initial spread rate of COVID-19: (i) proportion of the population over 65,
(ii) adult obesity, (iii) diabetes, (iv) education, (v) income, (vi) poverty, (vii) economic equality,
(viii) race, and (ix) political leaning (Table S4). The first three characteristics likely affect
morbidity39, although it is not clear how higher morbidity could affect the spread rate. The
remaining characteristics might affect health outcomes and responses to public health
interventions; for example, education, income, and poverty might all affect the need for
individuals to work in jobs that expose them to greater risks of infection. Nonetheless, because

we focused on the early spread of COVID-19, we anticipated that these characteristics would
have minimal effects. Despite the potential for all nine characteristics to affect estimates of r0,
we found that none was a statistically significant predictor of r0 when taking the four main
factors into account (all P > 0.1). We also repeated all of the analyses on estimates of r(t) after
COVID-19 was broadly established in the USA (5 May, 2020, assuming an average time
between infection and death of 18 days) (Table S5). The corresponding R2pred = 0.40, largely
driven by a large positive effect of the date of outbreak onset. The absence of significant effects
of the additional population characteristics on r0, and the lower explanatory power of the model
on r(t) at the end of the time series, underscore the importance of population density and spatial
autocorrelation in predicting county-level values of r0.

Extrapolating R0 to all counties
In the regression model (Table 1), the standard deviation of the residuals was 1.18 times
higher than the average standard error of the estimates of r0. This implies that the uncertainty of
an estimate of r0 from the regression is only slightly higher than the uncertainty in the estimate of
r0 from the time series itself; the fixed terms (ignoring spatial autocorrelation) in the regression
model explain 71% (= 1/1.192) of the explainable variance in r0. Therefore, using estimates from
death count time series from other counties will give estimates of r0 for a focal county (lacking
reliable estimates) that are almost as precise as the estimate from the county's time series. We
used the regression to extrapolate values of R0, for all 3109 counties in the conterminous USA
(Fig. 4, Table S1). The high predictability of r0, and hence R0, from the regression is seen in the
comparison between R0 calculated from the raw estimates of r0 (Fig. 4A) and R0 calculated from
the corrected r0 values (Fig. 4B). Extrapolation from the regression model makes it possible not

only to get refined estimates for the counties that were aggregated in the time-series analyses; it
also gives estimates for counties within states with so few deaths that county-aggregates could
not be analyzed (Fig. 4C,D). The end product is a map of estimated R0 values for the
conterminous USA (Fig. 4E).

Discussion
It is widely understood that different states and counties in the USA, and different
countries in the world, have experienced COVID-19 epidemics differently. Our analyses have
put numbers on these differences in the USA. The large differences argue for public health
interventions to be designed at the county level. For example, the vaccination coverage in the
most densely populated area, New York City, needed to prevent future outbreaks of COVID-19
will be much greater than for sparsely populated counties. Therefore, once vaccines are
developed, they should be distributed first to counties with high R0. Similarly, if vaccines are not
developed quickly and non-pharmaceutical public health interventions have to be re-instated
during resurgent outbreaks, then counties with higher R0 values will require stronger
interventions. As a final example, county-level R0 values can be used to assess the practicality of
contact-tracing of infections, which become impractical when R0 is high40,41.
Estimating county-level values of R0 at the start of the epidemic faces statistical
challenges that our analyses have tried to address. We used death counts, rather than cases
reported from testing, because particularly at the start of the epidemic, testing was limited and
heterogeneous among states and counties. Nonetheless, death counts are not perfect, because
different criteria could be used by different counties to ascribe deaths to SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, evidence suggests that "excess deaths" have occurred in comparison to historical

11

data12 and that these excess deaths are likely due to the mis-attribution to causes other than
SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, we estimated R0 from the spread rate of the disease (equation 1),
which depends on the change in the number of recorded deaths from one day to the next. This
change in death counts should be insensitive to the criteria used to ascribe death to SARS-CoV2, and although there are undoubtedly mistakes and omissions, our statistical methods account
for this measurement error.
We present our county-level estimates of R0 as preliminary guides for policy planning,
while recognizing the myriad other epidemiological factors (such as mobility42-44) and political
factors (such as legal jurisdictions45) that must shape public health decisions3,46-48. Although we
have emphasized the high predictability of R0 among counties in the USA, our estimates of R0
will be under-estimates for some regions if there are changes in the transmissibility of strains
(Fig. 3). This uncertainty underscores the need for more information about strain differences
affecting SARS-CoV-2 transmission23,25.
We recognize the importance of following the day-to-day changes in death and case rates,
and short-term projections used to anticipate hospital needs and modify public policies49-51.
Looking back to the initial spread rates, however, gives a window into the future and what public
health policies will be needed when COVID-19 is endemic.

Methods
1. Data selection and handling
1.1 Death data
For mortality due to COVID-19, we used time series provided by the New York Times11.
We selected the New York Times dataset because it is rigorously curated. We analyzed

separately only counties that had records of 100 or more deaths. The threshold of 100 was a
balance between including more counties and obtaining reliable estimates of r(t). Preliminary
simulations showed that time series with low numbers of deaths would bias r(t) estimates
(Supplementary Fig. S2). However, we did not want to use the maximum number of deaths as a
selection criterion, because this could lead to selection of counties based on data from a single
day. It would also involve some circularity, because the information obtained, r(t), would be
directly related to the criterion used to select data sets. Therefore, we used the threshold of 100
cumulative deaths. The District of Columbia was treated as a county. Also, because the New
York Times dataset aggregated the five boroughs of New York City, we treated them as a single
county. For counties with fewer than 100 deaths, we aggregated mortality to the state level to
create a single time series. For thirteen states (AK, DE, HI, ID, ME, MT, ND, NH, SD, UT, VM,
WV, and WY), the aggregated time series did not contain 100 or more deaths and were therefore
not analyzed.

1.2 Explanatory county-level variables
County-level variables were collected from several public data sources32-38. We selected
socio-economic variables a priori in part to represent a broad set of population characteristics.

2. Time series analysis
2.1 Time series model
We used a time-varying autoregressive model13,52,53 designed explicitly to estimate the
rate of increase of a variable using nonlinear, state-dependent error terms. We assume in our
analyses that the susceptible proportion of the population represented by a time series is close to

one, and therefore there is no decrease in the infection rate caused by a pool of individuals who
were infected, recovered, and were then immune to further infection.
The model is

x(t) = r(t–1) + x(t–1)

(1a)

r(t) = r(t–1) + wr(t)

(1b)

D(t) = exp(x(t) + ϕ(t))

(1c)

Here, x(t) is the unobserved, log-transformed value of daily deaths at time t, and D(t) is the
observed count that depends on the observation uncertainty described by the random variable
ϕ(t). Because a few of the datasets that we analyzed had zeros, we replaced zeros with 0.5 before
log-transformation. The model assumes that the death count increases exponentially at rate r(t),
where the latent state variable r(t) changes through time as a random walk with wr(t) ~ N(0, s2r).
We assume that the count data follow a quasi-Poisson distribution. Thus, the expectation of
counts at time t is exp(x(t)), and the variance is proportional to this expectation.
We fit the model using the Kalman filter to compute the maximum likelihood54,55. In
addition to the parameters s2r and s2ϕ, we estimated the initial value of r(t) at the start of the
time series, r0, and the initial value of x(t), x0. The estimation also requires an assumption for the
variance in x0 and r0, which we assumed were zero and s2r, respectively. In the validation using
simulated data (Supplementary Methods: Simulation model), we found that the estimation
process tended to absorb s2r to zero too often. To eliminate this absorption to zero, we imposed
a minimum of 0.02 on s2r, which eliminated the problem in the simulations.

2.2 Parametric bootstrapping
To generate approximate confidence intervals for the time-varying estimates of r(t) (Eq.
1b), we used a parametric bootstrap designed to simulate datasets with the same characteristics
as the real data that are then refit using the autoregressive model. We used bootstrapping to
obtain confidence intervals, because an initial simulation study showed that standard methods,
such as obtaining the variance of r(t) from the Kalman filter, were too conservative (the
confidence intervals too narrow) when the number of counts was small. Furthermore, parametric
bootstrapping can reveal bias and other features of a model, such as the lags we found during
model fitting (Supplementary Fig. S1A,B).
Changes in r(t) consist of unbiased day-to-day variation and the biased deviations that
lead to longer-term changes in r(t). The bootstrap treats the day-to-day variation as a random
variable while preserving the biased deviations that generate longer-term changes in r(t).
Specifically, the bootstrap was performed by calculating the differences between successive
estimates of r(t), Dr(t) = r(t) – r(t-1), and then standardizing to remove the bias, Drs(t) = Dr(t) –
E[Dr(t)], where E[] denotes the expected value. The sequence Drs(t) was fit using an
autoregressive time-series model with time lag 1, AR(1), to preserve any shorter-term
autocorrelation in the data. For the bootstrap a new time series was simulated from this AR(1)
model, Dr(t), and then standardized, Drs(t) = Dr(t) – E[Dr(t)]. The simulated time series for the
spread rate was constructed as r(t) = r(t) + Drs(t)/ 21/2, where dividing by 21/2 accounts for the
fact that Drs(t) was calculated from the difference between successive values of r(t). A new time
series of count data, x(t), was then generated using equation 1 with the parameters from fitting

the variance in r(t), s2r, to the same value as estimated from the data. Therefore, the bootstrap
confidence intervals are conditional of the estimate of s2r.

2.3. Calculating R0
We derived estimates of R(t) directly from r(t) using the Dublin-Lotka equation16 from
demography. This equation is derived from a convolution of the distribution of births under the
assumption of exponential population growth. In our case, the “birth” of COVID-19 is the
secondary infection of susceptible hosts leading to death, and the assumption of exponential
population growth is equivalent to assuming that the initial rate of spread of the disease is
exponential, as is the case in equation 1. Thus,

R(t) = 1/Ste-r(t)tp(t)

(2)

where p(t) is the distribution of the proportion of secondary infections caused by a primary
infection that occurred t days previously. We used the distribution of p(t) from Li et al.56 that
had an average serial interval of T0 = 7.5 days; smaller or larger values of T0, and greater or
lesser variance in p(t), will decrease or increase R(t) but will not change the pattern in R(t)
through time. Note that the uncertainty in the distribution of serial times for COVID-19 is a
major reason why we focus on estimating r0, rather than R0: the estimates of r0 are not contingent
on time distributions that are poorly known. Computing R(t) from r(t) also does not depend on
the mean or variance in time between secondary infection and death. We report values of R(t) at
dates that are offset by 18 days, the average length of time between initial infection and death

given by Zhou et al.57.

2.4. Initial date of the time series
Many time series consisted of initial periods containing zeros that were uninformative.
As the initial date for the time series, we chose the day on which the estimated daily death count
exceeded 1. To estimate the daily death count, we fit a Generalized Additive Mixed Model
(GAMM) to the death data while accounting for autocorrelation and greater measurement error
at low counts using the R package mgcv58. We used this procedure, rather than using a threshold
of the raw death count, because the raw death count will include variability due to sampling
small numbers of deaths. Applying the GAMM to “smooth” over the variation in count data
gives a well-justified method for standardizing the initial dates for each time series.

2.5. Validation
We performed extensive simulations to validate the time-series analysis approach
(Supplementary Methods: Simulation model).

3. Regression analysis for r0
We applied a Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression model to explain the variation
in estimates of r0 from the 160 county and county-aggregate time series:

r0 = b0 + b1 start.date + b2 log(pop.size) + b3 pop.den0.25 + e
e = N(0, s2S)

where start.date is the Julian date of the start of the time series, log(pop.size) and pop.den0.25 are
the log-transformed population size and 0.25 power-transformed population density of the
county or county-aggregate, respectively, and e is a Gaussian random variable with covariance
matrix s2S. We used the transforms log(pop.size) and pop.den0.25 to account for nonlinear
relationships with r0, and we selected these transforms to give the highest maximum likelihood
of the overall regression. The covariance matrix contains a spatial correlation matrix of the form
C = uI + (1-u)S(g) where u is the nugget and S(g) contains elements exp(-dij/g), where dij is the
distance between spatial locations and g is the range59. To incorporate differences in the
precision of the estimates of r0 among time series, we weighted by the vector of their standard
errors, s, so that S = diag(s) * C * diag(s), where * denotes matrix multiplication. With this
weighting, the overall scaling term for the variance, s2, will equal 1 if the residual variance of
the regression model matches the square of the standard errors of the estimates of r0 from the
time series. We fit the regression model with the function gls() in the R package nlme60.
To make predictions for new values of r0, we used the relationship

𝑒̂ i = 𝑒̅ + vi * V-1(ei - 𝑒̅ )

(4)

where ei is the GLS residual for data i, 𝑒̂ i is the predicted residual, 𝑒̅ is the mean of the GLS
residuals, V is the covariance matrix for data other than i, and vi is a row vector containing the
covariances between data i and the other data in the dataset61. This equation was used for three
purposes. First, we used it to compute R2pred for the regression model by removing each data
point, recomputing 𝑒̂ i, and using these values to compute the predicted residual variance18.
Second, we used it to obtain predicted values of r0, and subsequently R0, for the 160 counties and

county-aggregates for which r0 was also from time series. Third, we used equation (4) to obtain
predicted values of r0, and hence predicted R0, for all other counties. We also calculated the
variance of the estimates from61

𝑣%i = s2 – vi * V-1 * vit

(5)

Predicted values of R0 were mapped using the R package usmap62.

4. Regression analysis for SARS-CoV-2 effects on r0
The GISAID metadata22 for SARS-CoV-2 contains the clade and state-level location for
strains in the USA; strains G, GH, and GR contain the G614 mutation. For each state, we limited
the SARS-CoV-2 genomes to those collected no more than 30 days following the onset of
outbreak that we used as the starting point for the time series from which we estimated r0; from
these genomes (totaling 5290 from all states), we calculated the proportion that had the G614
mutation. Only twenty-eight states had five or more genomes, so we limited the analyses to these
states. For each state, we selected the estimates of r0 from the county or county-aggregate
representing the greatest number of deaths. We fit these estimates of r0 with the weighted Least
Squares (LS) model as in equation (3) with additional variables for strain. Figure 3 was
constructed using the R packages usmap62 and scatterpie63.

5. Statistics and Reproducibility
The statistics for this study are summarized in the preceding sections of the Methods. No
experiments were conducted, so experimental reproducibility is not an issue. Nonetheless, we

initial spread rate, r0, against (i) the date of outbreak onset, (ii) total population size and (iii)
population density, in which (iv) spatial autocorrelation is incorporated into the residual error.
Transforms of population size and density were selected to best-fit the data and satisfy linearity
assumptions. The coefficient column contains the estimate of the regression parameters with
their associated t-tests; spatial autocorrelation is characterized by a range and nugget for regional
and local sources of variation, and their joint significance is given by a likelihood ratio test. For
the overall model, R2pred = 0.70, and the residual standard error is 1.19.

are obtained from the regression model, with corrections to standardize values to an outbreak

the raw estimates of R0 (A) and the corrected R0 values (B) shows the predictive power of the

possible to extend estimates of R0 to all 3109 counties in the conterminous USA.

Supplementary Methods
Overview of Statistical Methods
The rate of spread of a disease in a population at the early phase of an epidemic, r0, when
the entire population is susceptible depends on the basic reproduction number, R0, giving the
number of secondary infections produced per infected individual, and the distribution of the time
between primary and secondary infections. Thus, if the spread rate and distribution of infection
times can be estimated, R0 can then be calculated. Our strategy is to estimate r0 as the most direct
parameter associated with the dynamics of an epidemic, and then subsequently estimate R0. The
advantages of calculating r0 include: (i) it captures all of the real-life complexities that affect R0
by simply observing what happened in real life, and (ii) it uses data that are (tragically) becoming
more prevalent. The challenges include (i) the changes in r(t) that are to be expected (and hoped
for) as people and governments respond to lessen the spread, and (ii) the statistical challenges and
uncertainties of determining rates of disease spread when the numbers of deaths are still low.
We developed and tested statistical methods to overcome the two challenges of estimating
R0 from death data. Because the rate of spread of a disease may change rapidly in response to
actions that are taken to reduce disease transmission, we used a time-varying autoregressive model
that allows for the rate of spread to change through time, r(t). Other models take a related
approach1,2. The second challenge is that the counts of deaths at the beginning of an epidemic are
low. To account for this, the time-series model includes increased uncertainty (measurement error)
that depends on the time-varying estimate of the number of deaths. Standard (asymptotic)
approaches often have poor statistical properties (type I errors, correctly calculated confidence
intervals) when sample sizes are small3. Therefore, we use bootstrapping4 in which simulation time
series are reconstructed to share the same pattern as the observed time series; a large number of
simulated time series are then fit using the same statistical model as used to fit the original data.
This bootstrapping procedure thus gives estimates and confidence intervals for model fit to the real
data. Note that our approach is frequentist, in comparison to the majority of models that use a
Bayesian framework.
Our approach focuses on estimating the time-varying rate of spread, r(t), of the number of
deaths. Our rationale is that, for statistical fitting, it is better to keep the model as simple as
possible, rather than "building in" assumptions about the processes of infection, reporting, and

death. Our simple phenomenological model uses the same data as more-complicated, processbased models, and therefore both approaches ultimately rely on the same information. The simpler
approach, however, does not depend on assumptions about the infection processes. Instead, after
estimating r0, we computed R0 as 1/Ste-r(t)tp(t), where t is the number days after initial infection,
and p(t) is the proportion of secondary infections produced per infected individual at t 5. This
expression assumes that deaths (removal of individuals from the population) occur after all
secondary infections have occurred. We used the distribution of p(t) that was estimated using
contact tracing in Wuhan, China6.
To validate the statistical method, we constructed a simulation model of the transmission
process and spread of infections iterated on a daily time scale. Our simulations considered
scenarios in which the transmission rate changed through time either in steps or gradually to
capture the extremes of possible changes in real R(t). We varied the initial R0 and duration of
simulations to produce epidemics that qualitatively match the county data we analyzed. Changes
in our estimates of r(t) tended to lag behind changes in the true (simulated) value of r(t) (gray line
and regions in Supplementary Fig. S1A,B), and therefore we also estimated r(t) in the reverse
direction (blue line and regions in Supplementary Fig. S1A,B). For the estimate of the initial r0,
we averaged the estimates from the forward and reverse time series. For the scenario of step
changes in R(t) (Supplementary Fig. S1C), the estimates were unbiased and had accurate
confidence intervals, although for the scenario of gradual changes (Supplementary Fig. S1D), there
was some downwards bias. Nonetheless, the estimates of initial R0 captured the order of
simulations according to the true R0. In contrast, fitting the same time series with a commonly used
Bayesian model that incorporates the transmission process given in the R package EpiEstim7 gave
estimates that poorly reflect the true (simulated) initial R0 (Supplementary Fig. S1E,F).
We also used the simulation model to investigate the properties of the statistical method
when the number of deaths was low, as occurred in some time series. Reducing the simulated
values of R0 reveals that the estimates of r0 become biased downwards when the maximum number
of reported deaths per day drops below 15 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). This is due to the time series
containing too little information about the rate of increase in the number of mortalities for accurate
estimates. Because we did not think that our method (or any other) could overcome this challenge,
we incorporated population size encompassed by a time series in the subsequent regression
analysis. We used population size rather than the maximum number of deaths, because this would

introduce a confounding effect: time series with higher r0 will likely have higher numbers of
deaths.
In order to extrapolate the estimates of R0 from 160 time series to the remaining counties
in the conterminous USA, we a priori selected four predictors. We selected population size
encompassed by the time series to account for possible downwards bias in sparse datasets. We
selected the Julian date of the outbreak onset to factor out public and private responses to COVID19. We included population density, because it could potentially affect transmission rates.
Population size and density were weakly and negatively correlated among the 160 time series
(Pearson correlation between log population size and log density = –0.25), and therefore there
were no problems with multicollinearity. Finally, the regression model included spatial
autocorrelation based on the latitude and longitude of the population-weighted midpoint of the
counties or county aggregates. Because the regression model had residual variance that was only
slightly higher than the variance of the estimates of r0 that the regression predicted, the precision
of the estimates from the regression for the counties without time series will be on par with the
precision of the counties with time series.
Simulation model
To assess the robustness of the statistical model, we built a simulation model of a
hypothetical epidemic. The simulation model tracks the epidemic on a daily time scale and
explicitly includes the time period from infection to subsequent transmission (infectiousness), and
from infection to death; therefore, it is akin to a SEIR model. The simulation model was not the
same as the statistical model, so the goal was to determine whether the phenomenological
statistical model was capable of capturing the rate of infection spread in the process-based
simulations.
The simulation model tracks the number of infected individuals on day t who were infected

t days previously, X(t;t). After 25 days, they are all assumed to be recovered or dead. The
probability distribution of the day on which a susceptible is infected, p(t), is given by a Weibull
distribution with mean 7.5 days and standard deviation 3.46 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). For an
individual who dies, the day of death, d(t), is given by a Weibull distribution with mean 18.5 days
and standard deviation 3.46 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Finally, for case data we need to know the
time between initial infection and diagnosis, h(t), which we assume is lognormally distributed with

mean 5.5 days and standard deviation 2.28 (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
On day t, the number of new infections produced by individuals who were infected t days
earlier is b(t) p(t). The term b(t) is closely related to R(t), the number of secondary infections
caused per infection. However, because we allow b(t) to fluctuate on a daily basis, here we use a
notation that differs from R(t). Note, however, that on average R(t) =

St b(t + t) p(t). The total

number of new infections on day t is given by a lognormal Poisson distribution in which the mean
of the Poisson process is b(t) a(t)

St p(t)X(t;t), where the lognormal random variable a(t) is

included to represent environmental variation.
Deaths occur according to a binomial distribution for each infection age category X(t;t), so
that the probability of death of individuals that had been infected t days earlier is (1 – s) b(t) d(t),
where s is the overall survival probability and b(t) is a lognormal distribution. We assume that the
overall survival probability for COVID-19 is 98%; changes in this assumption had little effect on
the simulation study. Once an individual dies, they are removed from the pool of individuals.
To illustrate the simulations, we assumed that the expectation of the infection rate, b(t),
changes as a step function (Supplementary Fig. S4A, black line), while there is also daily variation
around this expectation (Supplementary Fig. S4A, points). We also calculated R(t) from the
asymptotic rate of disease spread (Supplementary Fig. S4A, red line). This shows that the expected
daily infection rate, b(t), is closely related to the population-level R(t). Over the simulated time
series of 60 days, we then recorded the number of deaths (Supplementary Fig. S4B) and diagnosed
cases (Supplementary Fig. S4C). We initiated the simulation with a single cohort of individuals,
all infected on day 1 (Supplementary Fig. S4C, filled black dot). This gives the "worst-case"
situation in which the distribution of time-since-infection is far from the stable age distribution.
We fit this simulated dataset using the same procedure as we used for the real data,
including the same rules to determine which day to initiate the fitted time series (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). We performed a similar exercise while assuming that the expectation of the infection
rate, b(t) changes geometrically, producing a linear change in r(t) (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In
this particular example, the estimated values of r(t) are below the true values in the simulation in
the first part of the time series. Because there was a lag in response of the estimates of r(t) relative
to b(t), we fit the time series in both the forward and reversed directions, and we averaged these
values (and their confidence intervals) for the final estimates. Note that this is possible in our

approach, because we estimate r(t) rather than R(t).
We performed 100 simulations with the expectation of b(t) changing as either a step
function (Supplementary Fig. S1C) or geometrically (Supplementary Fig. S1D), to assess the
overall robustness of the modeling approach. Simulations were performed by changing the initial
value of b(t). Because higher values of b(t) led to much higher numbers of deaths, we shorted the
intervals between step changes and increased the decline in geometric changes in b(t) to roughly
match the observed time series. Specifically, the simulated time series ranged in length from 55 to
150 days: for the case of step changes, the time series were broken into three equal periods, and
for the case of geometric changes, the ending value of b(t) was kept the same. We also estimated
R(t) using the R package EpiEstim under default control parameters7. EpiEstim has the same
general structure of many of the Bayesian models that estimate R(t) directly using information
about the transmission process (Supplementary Fig. S1E,F). Even though EpiEstim is structurally
more complicated than our model, it tended to give values of R0 that were biased upwards when
the true value was low, and biased downward when the true value was high. Finally, we
investigated the bias in our estimates of r0 when the maximum number of deaths in a time series
was low by simulating time series for 20 to 70 days, using an initial value of b(t) to correspond to
R0 = 4, and changing the timing of step changes or the rate of geometric decline of b(t) to
correspond to the length of the time series. The simulations show that the estimates of r0 are
downward biased when the total numbers of counts are low (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Analysis of Nextstrain metadata of SARS-CoV-2 strains
In the analyses presented in the main text, we used the GISAID metadata to test the specific
assumption that the G614 mutation increases the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2. Prior to this
analysis, however, we analyzed a subset of the genomic data available from Nextstrain9. We
present this analysis here, because it was a naïve analysis that did not have a specific hypothesis
about what strains might lead to higher spread rates. Instead, we asked whether the proportion of
different Nextstrain clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20B, 20C in the USA) within a population were related
to r0 estimates. We used the same statistical approach as we present for the GISAID metadata,
except we included the proportion of strains from clades 19A, 19B, 20A, and 20B instead of the
proportion in the G clades containing mutation G614; we excluded the largest clade, 20C, because

the sums of the proportions must add to one, and therefore all of the information about the
distribution of strain 20C among states is contained in the distribution of the other clades. We
found that the proportion of samples within clade 19B had a negative effect on r0 (P = 0.019, Table
S3). The high proportion of strains from 19B in the Pacific Northwest and the Southeast were
associated with lower values of r0 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Strain 19A, however, also does not
contain the G614 mutation, and it did not have a negative effect on r0.

S1 were performed assuming r(t) changed either (A) in steps or (B) gradually. The simulations
were performed using the same initial value of r0, but the length of time of the simulation was
varied to change the maximum number of deaths that occurred. Due to the stochastic nature of the
simulations, the realized value of r0 when the analysis was started differed among time series when
r(t) changed gradually (red points in B), while they were all 0.22 when r(t) was changed in steps
(A). The median in the maximum number of deaths among the real county time series was 21.

Fig. S5. Spatial distribution of the 19B clade of SARS-CoV-2 at the outbreak onset among
states. Pie charts give the proportion of samples in states collected within 30 days following the
outbreak onset that are in the 19B clade (blue). The size of the pie is proportional to the residual
values of r0 after removing the effects of the timing of outbreak onset, population size represented
by the time series, and population density. For each state, we used the estimate of r0 corresponding
to the county or county-aggregate that had the greatest number of deaths.

Table S2. Regression of the initial spread rate, r0, of COVID-19 against (i) the date of outbreak
onset, (ii) total population size, (iii) population density, and (iv) the proportion of samples of
SARS-CoV-2 containing the G614 mutation in the spike gene10. The estimates of r0 were for the
county or county-aggregate with the greatest number of deaths in the state. All genetic samples
were collected within 30 days following the onset of outbreak in a county. Twenty-eight states had
five or more genetic samples, and only these states are included in the regression. Transforms of
population size and density were selected to best-fit the data and satisfy linearity assumptions.

series, corresponding to 5 May, 2020, r(tend), against (i) the date of outbreak onset, (ii) total
population size and (iii) population density, in which (iv) spatial autocorrelation is incorporated
into the residual error. Transforms of population size and density were selected to best-fit the data
and satisfy linearity assumptions. The coefficient column contains the estimate of the regression
parameters with their associated t-tests; spatial autocorrelation is characterized by a range and
nugget for regional and local sources of variation, and their joint significance is given by a
likelihood ratio test. For the overall model, R2pred = 0.40.
