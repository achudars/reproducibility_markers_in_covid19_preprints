Abstract:

Introduction:
Throughout March – April 2020, many patients with COVID-19 presented to Southend
University Hospital with Acute Hypoxaemic Respiratory Failure (AHRF). Patients were
managed in a Specialist Respiratory High Dependency Unit. We present our experience on
the usage of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy and possible indicators of
its success in this patient group.

Methods:
Data from patients (n=89) requiring mechanical ventilation during the months of March-April
2020, were retrospectively collected and analysed.

37 patients received IMV (Invasive

Mechanical Ventilation) without a CPAP trial beforehand. 52 patients underwent a CPAP
trial, of which 21 patients successfully avoided intubation and ITU admission.

Results:
The 52 patients, prior to receiving CPAP had significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a
low PaO2: FiO2 (PFR) (mean± SD 123 ± 60 mmHg) and mean SpO2:FiO2 (SFR) (mean ±
SD: 140 ± 50). The main indicators of CPAP success were: higher SFR before and after
CPAP, lower respiratory rate (RR) , lower Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and higher
PFR prior to CPAP.

Discussion:
CPAP proved successful in 40% of COVID-19 patients presenting with AHRF. SFR, PFR,
RR and NLR are predictors of such success. SFR can be used for effective real time
monitoring of patients before and after CPAP to identify likelihood of success. Based on our
results, we have suggested a modified CPAP management protocol in COVID-19. These
findings can guide future studies and will allow improved triage of patients to either CPAP or
IMV, in the event of a future COVID peak.

Introduction

As of May 2020, more than 5.9 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19
including more than 367,000 fatalities. (1) Whilst most patients are asymptomatic or mildly
affected, in the United Kingdom, 17% of COVID-19 hospitalised patients were admitted to
Intermediate or Intensive Care units. (2)
In COVID-19, acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF) may be caused by acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia (not meeting the ARDS criteria). (3) In
cases refractory to oxygen therapy, the view that such patients should undergo early invasive
mechanical ventilation (IMV) without the option for less invasive treatments such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation NIPPV has been suggested. (4) However, IMV is not
without complications, such as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), excessive sedation and
haemodynamic consequences. (5) NIPPV can be provided as continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP). (6) The role of CPAP in
AHRF in COVID-19 is currently not well established. Currently in the UK, 16% and 10% of
UK hospitalised COVID-19 patients have received IMV and NIPPV respectively. (2)
The UK National Health Service (NHS) issued specific guidance on the use of NIPPV in
COVID-19 in March 2020. Following this guidance, we created an algorithm for the use of
CPAP in COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital (Figure 1). The decision of whether to
give the patient a trial of CPAP or to intubate directly was guided by our algorithm. However,
it is important to note that the final decision lay with the on call respiratory consultant and the
ITU team. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the predictors of CPAP
outcome in these patients.

Patients and methodology:

Inclusion Criteria:
Adult COVID-19 patients (≥ 18 years old) admitted to Southend University Hospital (UK)
between the 1st of March 2020 and the 30th of April 2020 that underwent CPAP treatment in
the Acute Respiratory Care Unit (ARCU) were included in the study. All patients had been
tested SARS-CoV2 RNA positive using Nose and Throat swabs sent for real time RT-PCR
(RdRp gene assay).

Exclusion criteria:
COVID-19 patients who had any form of domiciliary NIPPV for obstructive sleep apnoea, or
for any other reason, prior to hospital admission, were excluded from the study. Patients who
underwent hospital BiPAP or received CPAP for the treatment of cardiogenic pulmonary
oedema were also excluded from the study.

Settings:
The ARCU is a specialised unit staffed by experienced respiratory consultants and nurses.
Patients on CPAP were nursed with 1:2 nurse to patient ratio. Emphasis was placed on a
secure fitting interface of the CPAP system with a double filter (expiratory filter for the face
mask, and exhaust system filter) in order to reduce widespread dispersion of exhaled air in
addition to strictly following guidance on use of personal protective equipment (PPE), thus
minimising the risk of airborne generating procedures (AGPs) to healthcare workers. (4)

Data Collection:
Data was collected retrospectively using various hospital databases and patients’ medical
notes. The ARCU reports to the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre
(ICNARC). We screened the ICNARC database for all eligible COVID-19 patients and
collected their demographic data. Patients escalation status was collected using ‘treatment
escalation plan’ prior to CPAP trial and patients were classed as ‘full escalation’ or ‘NIPPV’
ceiling of treatment.

Vital signs & Investigations:
The patients’ oxygen saturations (SpO2) on room air as recorded by pulse oximetry was
recorded on admission. Patients oxygen saturations (SpO2) and supplementary oxygen (FiO2)
prior to CPAP were recorded. Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and alertness on AVPU
scale were also recorded.
SpO2 to FiO2 ratio (SFR) was calculated prior to receiving CPAP. SFR post CPAP trial was
also recorded using an average of the first three pulse oximeter recordings divided by the
average of the first three FiO2 recordings within 30-120 minutes of the start of CPAP. All
measurements were taken while patient was in the supine position, and when on CPAP, its
pressure was 10 cm H2O.
The PFR (mmHg), also known as the Horowitz index was calculated as the ratio between
PaO2 (in mmHg) and FiO2. In order to standardise FiO2 across various oxygen delivery
systems, the following standardisations were used:

1-

Prior to CPAP: Most of the patients were on Venturi Mask 40% as per protocol.

Other oxygen delivery systems were calculated as follows: High flow oxygen via
Whisperflow, Philips (100%), Non rebreathe mask 15 L/m flow (85%) and other standard
venturi denominations 2 L/min (24%), 4 L/min (28%), 8 L/min (35%), 10L/min (40%) 15
L/min (60%)
2-

On CPAP: FiO2 readings on the oxygen analyser of the Whisperflow Philips CPAP

machine were recorded. For the minority of patients where CPAP mode of the NIPPY 3+
machine was used with supplemental oxygen, calculations followed the Venturi protocol, i.e.
10L (40%), 15L/min (60%). (7)
The following biochemical markers were recorded upon admission and prior to CPAP: CRP
(mg/L), Neutrophils (109/L), Lymphocytes (109/L) and D-dimer (ng/ml). Neutrophil to
lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated. In addition, admission chest x-ray findings were
reviewed retrospectively by a radiologist to determine if they showed bilateral pulmonary
infiltrates, compatible with the diagnosis of ARDS.
End point:
A successful CPAP trial was defined as the successful weaning of CPAP to other oxygen
delivery devices with no re-institution of any form of MV for 72 hours. A ‘fail’ on the CPAP
trial occurred when the responsible respiratory consultant decided to end the CPAP trial,

either proceeding to intubation or if their ceiling of treatment was NIPPV they were stepped
down to a ward-based ceiling of treatment.

Registration and ethical approval:
The work has been approved ethically and registered in the hospital R&D under registration
number 20007.

Statistical Analysis:
Quantitative data were described by mean (standard deviation) and median (minimummaximum). While categorical variables were summarized by frequency and percent.
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis by DeLong method was
performed to detect the predictive performance of different indices for CPAP success. (8)
An optimal cut-off point for each index test was determined by Youden index. (9)
We conducted bivariate analysis using Independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test
based on quantitative variables distribution as well as Pearson’s Chi-square test to compare
different demographic and clinical parameters between CPAP success and failure groups.
Statistically significant, and clinically relevant categorized predictors based on ROC analysis
results were fitted in multivariate stepwise backward Wald logistic regression analysis.
Pearson’s correlation test was also used to study linear relation between PFR and SFR. (10)
Decision trees by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis were performed
for depicting the prognostic factors associated with success before and after CPAP. The main
variables associated with CPAP success were ordered by their relative importance: SFR
before and after CPAP, respiratory rate prior to CPAP, NLR and PFR. Performance of each
classification tree was determined by calculating accuracy of model’s predicted probability
with corresponding area under the curve. (11)
We did not calculate sample size, however, power analysis for each of AUC for SFR
before and after CPAP as well as NLR was at least more than 80%.
Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS statistics program (12), and R software
with the following packages: “rpart”, “rpart.plot” , "pROC" and “ROCR”. (13) All statistical
tests were two-sided and judged at 0.05 significance level.

Results
89 patients with AHRF were identified. 37 patients were intubated directly and 52 patients
underwent a CPAP trial in the ARCU. 40.3% of the patients passed the CPAP trial (n=21).
All patients survived after passing the CPAP trial while among those intubated 38% died
(p<.001).
There were no significant differences in demographic data or co-morbidities between those
groups who failed or succeeded on CPAP (Table 1). Diabetes Mellitus was more prevalent in
the CPAP failure group (32% vs 14%) but that difference did not reach statistical
significance. The CPAP cohort suffered significant respiratory failure as evidenced by a
mean PFR (123.15 ± 59.56) and mean SFR (140 ± 50). 48 patients (92%) met the Berlin
definition of ARDS confirming the severity of the disease in this group of patients.

Both pre and post CPAP median SFR values were significantly higher in those patients that
underwent a successful CPAP trial (p <.05) and median NLR was significantly lower.
However, ∆SFR did not differ significantly between both groups (p >.05). For all patients,
the mean SFR improved significantly post-CPAP (140±50, p<.001) whether patients failed
(p.001) or passed the trial (p .016). We detected also significant positive linear relation
between PFR and SFR before (r=.417, p.002) and after CPAP (r =.579, p<.001).
NLR was a fair predictor for CPAP success with corresponding sensitivity of 76.2%,
specificity of 71% and accuracy of 79% (AUC=0.79, p <.001) (Table 2). A cut-off value less
than 8.21 best predicted CPAP success (Figure 2). (OR, 95%CI: 7.38, 1.64-33.19).
Moreover, SFR pre-CPAP significantly differentiated success from failure (AUC=0.78, p
<0.001). A cut off value of < 114 best predicted CPAP failure. SFR 30-120 minutes postCPAP was a good predictor of CPAP success (AUC=.807, p<.001) with a sensitivity and
specificity of 71.4 and 81.7% respectively. A cut-off value of 180 best distinguished between
CPAP success and failure with values ≥ 180 predicting CPAP success. A higher specificity
for SFR post-CPAP than sensitivity with large LR+ of 5.53 reveals that it is a good predictor
of

CPAP success. Comparison of AUC for SFR before and after CPAP revealed no

significant difference and both are significantly important predictors for CPAP success (p=

.823). PFR is a comparably poor predictor for CPAP success (AUC =.66, p .026) with cutoff value ≥106 predictive of CPAP success (figure 3).
95.7% of patients with CPAP success have SFR ≥114 prior to CPAP (p.002) while around
66.7% of CPAP success was achieved in patients with SFR post-CPAP ≥180 (p<.001). 76%
of CPAP successes occurred in patients with PFR ≥ 106 (p.008*) and around 76% of the
CPAP success group (76.2%) had lower level of NLR ≤ 8.21 (p.001).
Patients with NLR≤ 8.21 had almost 9 times greater chance of CPAP success than those with
NLR>8.21 (OR, 95%CI: 8.75, 2.08-36.8). The odds of success are nearly 9 times greater in
patients with pre-CPAP SFR ≥114 than patients whose post-CPAP SFR <114 (OR, 95%CI:
9.37, 1.9-45.9). -. SFR 30-120 minutes post-CPAP is the most important predictor of CPAP
success (Wald statistic=10.39). The odds of success are about 13 times greater in patients
with SFR after CPAP ≥180 than patients whose SFR after CPAP <180 (OR, 95%CI: 12.84,
2.72-60.62).

Discussion
We report a 40% success of CPAP in COVID-19 patients (n=21/52). We were able
to identify 5 significant predictors for CPAP success: RR, PFR, NLR, SFR preCPAP; and SFR 30-120 minutes after CPAP (Table 2). An SFR of 180 post-CPAP
was the most accurate predictor of CPAP success (AUC = 0.8) (Table 2 & 3,
Figure 2 & 3).
Hypoxic COVID-19 patients have a poor prognosis. The current published data on
NIPPV in COVID-19 patients is scarce and mainly reports survival as an endpoint.
Xie et al reported that an SpO2 less than 90% despite O2 therapy is associated with
high mortality. A quarter of such patients required ventilatory support including
IMV for 12% of them. (14) They reported 47% NIPPV success rate (7 out of 13).
(14) Chen et al showed that just 26 out of 102 patients after NIPPV survived. (15)
Yang et al showed that among 52 ITU patients, 29 were managed by NIPPV and
only 6 (20%) survived. (16) Our outcomes were better than previously reported.

The overall survival rate after CPAP (whether subsequently intubated or not) was
80% in those patients that were for full escalation (33 out of 41). Survival rate
across the whole cohort irrespective of ceiling of care was 65% (34 out of 52). In
our group of patients, among the 41 patients who had a decision “For Full
Escalation”, 20 patients passed their CPAP trial successfully avoiding intubation
and ITU admission (48.8%). Ten patients failed NIPPV and were palliated
(decision not to intubate).
Applying CPAP can improve oxygenation, recruit collapsed lung regions and
ameliorate the work of breathing. The latter can protect from patients’ selfinflicted lung injury (P-SILI) and diaphragmatic injury. A recent study showed that
64% of COVID-19 patients have recruitable lungs on day 1 after ITU admission
which may explain the benefit of CPAP. (17) An additive benefit may be observed
in patients with concomitant heart failure (reduced preload). A recent metaanalysis showed that NIPPV can decrease both the intubation rate and mortality for
patients with PFR of 200-300 mmHg, and when using helmets. (14) Another
observed benefit was the reduction of ITU and ventilator days which is of
particular importance when there is a severe strain on resources. (18) Most
significantly, a recent systematic review based on current evidence suggests that
the use of NIPPV in AHRF, similar to IMV, likely reduces the risk of mortality but

may increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to healthcare workers. (19)
The avoidance of endotracheal intubation carries many benefits not least of which
is the reduced burden on scarce ITU resources during a pandemic.

Our data suggest that monitoring should focus mainly on 2 parameters: (1) Work
of breathing and (2) Oxygenation. CPAP helps recruiting more functioning lung
units. (17) Patients with good lung compliance can generate high tidal and minute
volume before feeling short of breath and the RR started to increase significantly.
In our study, we showed a significant difference in the RR existed between the
failure and success groups before CPAP (Mean±SD 29.8±7.4 versus 25.5± 6.4
cycles per minute respectively, p=0.037) (Table 1).
We have demonstrated the value of SFR. Monitored before and 30-120 minutes
after the CPAP trial, it showed high sensitivity and specificity in detecting CPAP
outcome. In our opinion, such an approach can significantly improve the safety of
the CPAP trial out of the ITU settings. SFR offers many advantages over PFR. It is
based on a non-invasive, continuous and real time pulse oximeter monitoring. By
using CPAP and monitoring SFR, there is reduced need of ABG, cost and
complications related to this procedure. Moreover, SFR is non-invasive
measurement, easily monitored remotely thus reducing exposure to staff from risk
of infection related to aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). However, we
appreciate many limits of the SFR secondary to the potential inaccuracy of the
pulse

oximeter

in

certain

conditions:

motion,

low

perfusion,

dyshaemoglobinaemias, clubbing and nail polish. (20) The accuracy of SFR
parallels that of the SpO2: less accurate and less reflective the PaO2 when the SpO2
saturation becomes less than 90%. (21) We recommend that the SFR should not be
relied on solely in patient with SpO2 less than 90%. A constant relation between
SpO2 and PaO2 when in the range between 90 and 100% had been suggested and
fits our algorithm and patients. (21) The target SpO2 was 92 to 96% for all our
patients according to British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines. (22)

The SFR has previously been shown to have a promising role to predict ITU
admission. (23) Rice et al were able to describe a relation between PFR and SFR.
An SFR of 235 and 315 corresponded to PFR of 200 and 300 with a sensitivity of
85% and 91%; and specificity of 85% and 91% respectively. (24) Bilan et al also

were able to demonstrate the reliability of SFR for the diagnosis of moderate
ARDS, in substitute of the PFR. They demonstrate that an SFR of 181 and 235,
predict a PFR of 200 and 300, respectively. (25)
Using equations suggested in the previous 2 studies, we can suggest that our postCPAP SFR cut-off of 180, corresponds to PFR of 200 mmHg and moderate
ARDS.

Lastly, our results show NLR as a strong predictor of CPAP success. This is
related to its significance in predicting disease severity. Liang et al demonstrated
that NLR was one of the 10 independent and statistically significant predictors of
critical illness (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P = .003) in COVID-19 patients.
(26) Liu et al and Yang et al also showed that NLR is a significant risk factor for
poor outcome. (27,28) A meta-analysis of 5 studies showed NLR to be associated
with COVID-19 severity. (29) The NLR in COVID-19 reflects inflammation
which stimulates neutrophilia from one side and lymphocyte apoptosis from the
other side. (30)
Based on our results, we suggested a modified CPAP management protocol in
COVID-19 patients. (Fig 4) The modified algorithm needs further confirmation in
a larger study.

Decision tree algorithm for prediction of CPAP Success:
Before a CPAP trial, the best predictor of success is SFR. If a patient has SFR
≥230, probable outcome is CPAP success but if SFR <110, patients are more likely
to fail on CPAP. Patients with SFR between 110-230 should have RR prior to
CPAP measured and patients are more likely to succeed on CPAP if RR≥ 30 per
minute.
After CPAP trial, patients are monitored and if SFR is above 180, probable
outcome is CPAP success. If SFR ≤ 180, then the next step is to check NLR and if
it is >8.21, probable outcome is CPAP failure. However, patients with NLR ≤8.21
with RR ≥ 25/ min are more likely to pass on CPAP trial. Patients with NLR ≤8.21
with RR < 25/ min are predicted to fail on CPAP trial. (Figure 4)

Limits
Our study is not without limitations. First, it is a retrospective observational study
conducted on a small group of patients. Our results need confirmation in a larger
prospective work. Second, many mechanisms can contribute to AHRF even in a
single disease (e.g. Pneumonia, ARDS, but also pulmonary embolism which is not
rare in COVID-19). Third, it remains to be determined if the CPAP trial affected
the outcome of intubated patients in comparison to those promptly intubated from
the start. Furthermore, we did not use High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) which
may have a role. A randomised controlled trial may be needed for full comparison
between the 3 treatment modalities of HFNC, CPAP and early IMV.

Conclusion
CPAP has a significant role in the management of COVID-19 patients presenting
with AHRF. We have demonstrated that an experienced medical team following
protocol driven management can successfully use CPAP to manage patients with
COVID-19 and AHRF. In our group of patients, its success rate was 40%. SFR,
PFR, NLR and RR are predictors of such success. SFR is a non-invasive, real-time
measurement which can be used effectively to monitor these patients before and
after CPAP to identify likelihood of success and reduce the need for frequent
ABGs.
The proposed modified CPAP management algorithm provides an initial step for
better identifying those patients who will likely succeed on CPAP therapy. Thus,
reducing the need for unnecessary IMV, and its associated complications, which
can relieve pressure on scarce ITU resources during a pandemic. This algorithm
will strengthen decision making should we encounter a second wave of COVID19.
