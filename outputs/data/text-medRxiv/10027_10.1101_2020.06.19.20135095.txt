Key Points:
Question: Metformin has many anti-inflammatory effects, including sex-specific effects on TNFα. Is
metformin protective from the Sars-CoV-2 virus, and does the effect differ by sex?
Findings: Metformin was associated with reduced mortality in women who were hospitalized with
Covid-19, but not in men who were hospitalized with Covid-19.
Meaning: The sex-dependent survival by metformin use points towards TNFα reduction as a key
mechanism for protection from Covid-19.

Abstract
Importance: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are significant risk factors for mortality in Covid19.
Metformin has sex specific immunomodulatory effects which may elucidate treatment mechanisms in
COVID-19. Objective: We sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if
sex specific interactions exist.
Design: Retrospective review of de-identified claims from UnitedHealth Group’s Clinical Discovery
Database. Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on
metformin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors as home medications in individuals with
T2DM and obesity, controlling for comorbidities, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of
effect was assessed by sex.
Setting: The database includes all 50 states in the United States. Participants: Persons with at least 6
months of continuous coverage from UnitedHealth Group in 2019 who were hospitalized with Covid-19.
Persons in the metformin group had > 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before
hospitalization.
Results: 6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years. Metformin was associated with
decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780
(0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of
0.759 (0.601, 0.960). There was no significant reduction in mortality among men. TNFα inhibitors were
associated with decreased mortality, by propensity matching in a limited model, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983).
Conclusions: Metformin was significantly associated with reduced mortality in women with obesity or
T2DM in observational analyses of claims data from individuals hospitalized with Covid-19. This sexspecific finding is consistent with metformin’s reduction of TNFα in females over males, and suggests
that metformin conveys protection in Covid-19 through TNFα effects. Prospective studies are needed to
understand mechanism and causality.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread throughout the world.1 Despite exponential growth in Covid-19
related research, better understanding of this highly contagious and lethal virus is needed. An overall
mortality rate over 5% for all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 highlights the urgent need for
treatments while vaccines are developed.2
Observational data early in the outbreak identified male sex and increased age as leading risk
factors in Covid-19.3 Subsequent studies have identified hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease,
tobacco use, and obesity as important risk factors for Covid-19 outcomes.2,4-6 Persons hospitalized with
Covid-19 with overweight or obesity (body mass index, BMI≥25kg/m2) had a higher risk of needing
mechanical ventilation, after controlling for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.6
Additionally, among individuals with Covid-19 and a BMI ≥28kg/m,2 men have a higher risk of
developing severe Covid-19 than women.7 This sex difference may be explained by the accumulation of
visceral adiposity at lower BMI levels in men.8
Adipocytes, specifically visceral adipocytes, secrete many of the inflammatory and
coagulopathic molecules that are implicated in Covid-19 morbidity, including interleukin-6 (IL-6),
tumor-necrosis-factorα (TNFα), d-dimer, and others. 9-12 TNFα has been particularly important, with
high levels of TNFα found in lung tissue of persons with Covid-19.13 TNFα contributes to insulin
resistance, and levels of TNFα are higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 14 Both T2DM
and obesity are associated with lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.15 Metformin, the
first-line medication for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) decreases TNFα and IL-6, boost levels of IL-10, and has
been found to cause these beneficial effects significantly more in females more than males.16-20 Metformin
also increases activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which has important downstream
effects in Covid-19.16,21,22

Given these favorable effects of metformin on TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines that
contribute to Covid-19, our primary objective was to understand whether home metformin use was
associated with decreased mortality in persons hospitalized with Covid-19. We hypothesized that
metformin would be associated with decreased mortality from Covid-19 in persons with T2DM or
obesity, and that this benefit would be higher in women compared to men given metformin’s sex-specific
anti-inflammatory effects. We also hypothesized that TNFα inhibitors would be associated with decreased
mortality from Covid-19. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of de-identified claims data from
UnitedHealth Group’s Clinical Discovery Database of 6,256 persons hospitalized in the US with Covid19 in 2020.
Methods
Design and Data
Retrospective analysis of claims from UnitedHealth Group (UHG)’s Clinical Discovery Database
between January 1, 2020 – June 7, 2020. This database includes de-identified individual-level and statelevel data for individuals with Covid-19 admissions in all 50 U.S. states, covering a diverse range of ages,
ethnicities, and geographical regions. The claims data includes medical and pharmacy claims, laboratory
results, and enrollment records. This study was approved by the University of Minnesota institutional
review board (STUDY00001489) which provided a waiver of consent for this study.
Population
Individuals 18 years or older with T2DM or obesity, at least 6 months of continuous enrollment
in 2019, and a hospitalization for Covid-19 confirmed by polymerase change reaction (PCR), manual
chart review by UHG, or reported from the hospital to UHG. Individuals with both commercial and
Medicare Advantage insurance were included. Eighteen persons (0.12%) were missing age and were
excluded. An assumption was made that there was no missingness among the other variables. Individuals
with T2DM or obesity were included in the analysis (definition in Supplemental Materials 1).

Our primary outcome was in-hospital mortality defined using the hospital disposition indicator.
The individuals who remained hospitalized on June 7, 2020 without a hospital disposition were censored
in Cox proportional hazards model analyses and excluded from mixed model and propensity-matched
analyses. The database did not include data related to in-hospital complications, ICU, or ventilator
utilization and thus an analysis on these endpoints was not possible.
Independent Variable and confounding variables
The independent variable was a filled pharmacy prescription (visible through prescription claims,
matching the generic drug ingredient with the string “metformin”) indicating use of metformin, and
limited to patients with at least 90 days of metformin prescription from 12 months prior to Covid-19
diagnosis. Potential confounding medications hypothesized to be protective or harmful for patients with
Covid-19 determined by a large evidence-based consortium were assessed, as were possible confounding
co-morbidities (Supplemental Materials 1).23
Statistical analysis
Cohort age was expressed by median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were
expressed by percentages. Univariate analysis compared mortality for persons without vs with home
metformin use.
To determine whether metformin use was independently associated with reduced mortality for
patients hospitalized for Covid-19, multivariable models for mortality were developed with the use of the
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method,24 with the tuning parameter determined
by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). We also considered clinically relevant pairwise interactions to
determine whether their association with mortality differed according to metformin status. The non-linear
effect of age was modeled in two manners, using restricted cubic splines or categorized as (0-55, 56-65,
66-75, 76-85, 86+). Given the low mortality for patients 0-55 (5.1%) compared with other age groupings,
this group was not further categorized. Subgroup analyses of multivariate models were performed by sex.

Multivariate models:
(1) Logistic regression, controlling for all covariates in our conceptual framework (Table 1), and
for LASSO variables and state, with and without specific disease-medication interaction terms. (eTable
1).
(2) Mixed-effects logistic regression with state-level random effects, controlling for LASSO
variables, with and without specific disease-medication interaction terms. Only patients with known
hospital disposition were included in this analysis (eTable 2).
(3) Cox proportional-hazards regression by strata-specific and shared-frailty effects, with and
without specific disease-medication interaction terms; censoring determined based on claims made after
hospitalization up to June 7, 2020. Using a ‘best’ outcome approach, patients discharged not to hospice
were assigned a censoring time equal to the longest observed hospital stay (169 days).25,26 Scaled
Schoenfeld residual graphs and log-log plots were analyzed to confirm adequacy of the proportional
hazards assumption for home metformin use (eTable 3, eFigure 1).
(4) Propensity matched mixed effects logistic regression was performed, stratified by metformin
use. Propensity scores were estimated with logistic regression with variables selected by the
aforementioned LASSO logistic model and two evenly matched groups were formed with the common
caliper set at 0.2 (eFigure 2), and a model with exact matching.27,28 Even distribution of propensity scores
was confirmed between matched groups, with standardized differences less than 0.1 for all confounding
variables (eFigure 3). Univariate logistic regression was then used to compare mortality for persons who
were receiving (vs not receiving) home metformin among the matched cohort. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were also estimated and compared using a log-rank test (Figure 2).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted in individuals with Covid-19 confirmed by PCR (n=4,105).
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata MP, version 16 (StataCorp, College Station,
TX). Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p-value < 0.05.

Results
Characteristics of Cohort
Between Jan 1, 2020 – June 7, 2020, 15,380 individuals with pharmacy claims data and at least 6
months of enrollment were diagnosed and hospitalized with Covid-19 in UHG’s Clinical Discovery
Database (Figure 1). Overall 52.8% were female, median age 70 years (IQR 58- 80). Of these, 6,256
(40.7%) had a diagnosis of obesity or T2DM, of whom 1,185 (18.9%) died; and 2,333 (37.3%) had a
metformin prescription. Individuals taking metformin were younger (73 vs 76 years), more often male
(51.6%% versus 44.6%), and fewer died during their hospitalization for Covid-19 (17.8% vs 21.3%).
Most persons taking metformin had T2DM (99.3%) and hypertension (56.3%). About 4% of persons
taking metformin had asthma, 6% had chronic kidney disease, 19.5% had coronary artery disease, and 4%
had liver disease. Individuals on metformin were less likely to have a history of venous thromboembolism
(2.7% vs 4.1%), (Table 1). In unadjusted analyses, metformin was associated with decreased mortality,
OR 0.802 (0.701, 0.917) (Table 2).
Multivariate analyses of mortality by metformin use, in men and women with T2DM or obesity
Results of multivariate analyses are presented in Table 2. Mortality associated with all the
variables in the multivariate analyses are shown in Tables S1-S3. The log-log plot assessing the
proportionality assumption is presented in Figure S1; the distribution of the estimated propensity-score is
in Figure S2; the standardized difference in propensity-matched covariates is in Figure S3. Metformin use
not associated with statistically significantly decreased mortality in the overall sample (Table 2).

Assessment for heterogeneity of effect by sex, in subgroups of women with T2DM or obesity
A Kaplan-Meier curve of survival by metformin use in men and women is shown in Figure 2.
Metformin use was significantly associated with decreased mortality in women in logistic regression, OR
0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects model, OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards model,
HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity-matched model, OR 0.759 (0.601, 0.960), (Table 2, Figure 3).

Sensitivity analyses in patients with Covid-19 disease confirmed by polymerase chain reaction
In unadjusted analyses men and women with T2DM or obesity, metformin was not significantly
associated with decreased mortality, OR 0.859 (0.737, 1.002), nor by the Cox proportional hazards shared
frailty model in women, HR 0.808 (0.651, 1.003). Metformin was significantly associated with decreased
mortality in women with type-2 diabetes or obesity in the minimally adjusted Cox shared frailty model,
OR 0.790 (0.637, 0.978), and the propensity matched model, 0.744 (0.565, 0.980).
Multivariate analysis of anti-TNFα inhibitors
Of the 15,362 persons included in the main analyses, 38 (0.25%) had claims for a TNFα
inhibitor. In Cox proportional-hazards model, TNFα inhibitors were non-significantly associated with
decreased mortality, HR 0.350 (0.087, 1.415). In a propensity matched model, matched for the same
variables as the metformin analyses, TNFα inhibitors were non-significantly associated with decreased
mortality, 0.483 (0.0821, 2.845). In a propensity model matched only on age, sex, charlson co-morbidity
index, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, TNFα
inhibitors were significantly associated with decreased mortality, OR 0.19 (0.038, 0.983), (Figures S4,
eTable 4). A number of other variables were associated with increased or decreased risk of death from
Covid-19, notably inflammatory bowel disease and asthma treated with beta2-agonists (Tables S1-S3).

Discussion
This is the first study to report decreased mortality with outpatient metformin use in women with
T2DM or obesity in a large cohort of patients hospitalized in the US for Covid-19, and to describe a sex
difference in this response to metformin. These findings could have wide-reaching effects, as over 42% of
women in the US have obesity.29 We found that metformin use was associated with significantly lower
mortality among women across all multivariate analyses: logistic regression, mixed-effects analysis, Cox
proportional-hazards, and propensity-matched models. The significant protective benefit in women

compared to men may shed light on the mechanism by which metformin decreases mortality from Covid19, as metformin has been shown to reduce TNFα in females more than males.17-20
We also found reduced mortality in persons with outpatient use of TNFα inhibitors who were
hospitalized for Covid-19. TNFα inhibitor use was associated with large decreases in odds of mortality,
but these findings were not statistically significant, likely because of the small sample size of 38. Reduced
mortality in persons who use TNFα inhibitors would support previous research that TNFα plays a large
role in the pathology of Covid-19.30 TNFα leads to macrophage activation and increased cytokine release,
likely contributing to Covid-19 pathology.31
We considered other (overlapping) mechanisms by which metformin could reduce the severity of
SARS-CoV-2 infection: ACE2 receptor modulation (via AMPK), decreased cytokine release (IL6, TNFα,
increased IL-10), improved neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, decreased glycemia (via AMPK), mast cell
stabilization, decreased thrombosis, and improved endothelial function.16-18,32-44 In patients with and
without diabetes, metformin has been shown to decrease inflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNFα.16,43,45
These effects are notable, as IL-6 and TNFα are thought to contribute to Covid-19 pathology.13
Metformin’s effects on these cytokines have been shown to differ by sex, with favorable effects in female
over male mice, particularly for TNFα.18 Our findings of a strong sex-specific response to metformin in
Covid-19 suggests that TNFα reduction may be the primary way by which metformin reduced mortality
from Covid-19.
Our sex-specific findings are consistent with prior literature showing mortality benefit in women
but not men from colorectal cancer.20 Possible reasons for sex-specific effects of metformin include the
influence of sex hormones and epigenetic changes on the Y chromosome.46 There are 2 other potential
ways in which metformin might cause sex-specific responses in Covid-19: Metformin inhibits IgE- and
aryl hydrocarbon- mediated mast cell activation,47 and mast cell activation has been implicated as an early
indicator of inflammatory response to SARS-CoV2 and possibly cytokine storm.48 Mast cells from female
rats cause a greater increase in TNFα than mast cells in male rats, which could be one reason for greater

benefit from metformin in women than men.49 Lastly, activation of AMPK by metformin can lead to
increased expression of ACE2 and conformational changes to ACE2, and possibly decreasing SARSCoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor.35-37,50 Recent work by Li et al found that expression of ACE2
receptor was equal in male and female human lungs, but that cytokine responses differed between men
and women.38 This difference in subsequent inflammatory response and our sex-specific findings may
support metformin’s anti-inflammatory effects as the primary means of benefit in Covid-19.
Additionally, in our multivariate analyses, beta2-agonist use was associated with decreased
mortality in patients with asthma across all analyses (Tables S1-S3). This benefit may come from beta2agonists’ effect on boosting IL-10, which is a predominantly anti-inflammatory cytokine that can reduce
levels of TNFα.51 Metformin has also been shown to boost levels of IL-10, in females more than
males.43,45 The mortality benefit in persons with asthma on beta2-agonists, combined with our finding of
mortality benefit from metformin use, suggest that IL-10 may also be important in Covid-19.
In summary, we found that metformin was associated with a significant decrease in mortality for
women with T2DM or obesity who were hospitalized for Covid-19, in an observational analysis of deidentified claims. We found no significant mortality benefit in men with T2DM or obesity who were
hospitalized with Covid-19. The sex-specific effects of metformin on TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10, and our
findings of benefit in women, might indicate that metformin’s protective effect in Covid-19 is primarily
through effects on TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10. The importance of TNFα in Covid-19 is supported by our
finding that TNFα inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality from Covid-19. The fact that
these outpatient medications convey benefit in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 is interesting because
metformin is universally stopped at hospital admission, suggesting its protective effects begin prior to
hospitalization.
Given metformin’s good safety profile and availability,52 it should be prospectively assessed for
protective benefit from Covid-19. Gastrointestinal side effects from metformin can be eliminated for over
85% of patients with use of the newer extended-release formulations, and further with administration at

the end of a meal.53 With the median time to hospitalization for Covid-19 being about 1 week, it is
necessary to understand the duration of metformin use that conveys benefit, and whether it prevents
Covid-19. Over 34% of adults in the US have prediabetes,54 yet it is highly under-diagnosed as over 90%
of them are not aware that they do.55 Thus metformin for prevention of Covid-19 may be reasonable as
metformin may be indicated for many adults in the US anyway. Additionally, increased inflammation
from adiposity, and obesity’s association with increased risk of poor outcomes from Covid-19, metformin
should also be assessed in patients of all BMI categories.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Although claims data show metformin prescribed as a home
medication for at least 90 days within the last 12 months, it does not give information about adherence.
Metformin is sometimes purchased without insurance claims in this population because of its low cost,
thus some individuals in our control group may have been exposed to the treatment, which would reduce
the observed effect size. Prescriptions for outpatient use of metformin cannot be extrapolated to starting
metformin at Covid-19 diagnosis or inpatient use. Retrospective analyses are subject to biases and
unmeasured confounding. While multicollinearity among potential confounders makes interpreting their
independent associations with in-hospital mortality potentially difficult, adjustments for these
confounders is necessary to minimize bias for estimating the causal effect of home metformin use on inhospital mortality.56,57
Conclusion
In a large de-identified claims database of adults with T2DM or obesity, metformin was
associated with significantly decreased mortality in women hospitalized with Covid-19, with no
significant mortality reduction in men. Mechanistic reasons that support a sex-specific reason for
metformin to be protective in Covid-19 include anti-inflammatory effects on TNFα, IL-6, and possibly
IL-10. We also found that TNFα inhibitors were associated with reduced mortality, this finding was not
significant in all models, likely due to the small sample size. Metformin has a good safety profile,

availability, and needs to be prospectively assessed to understand mechanism, duration, and timing of
treatment necessary for benefit. Given obesity’s pro-inflammatory effects that contribute to Covid-19
pathology, and the potential anti-inflammatory benefit of metformin in Covid-19, metformin should also
be assessed in all BMI categories.

Figure 2: This is a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. The top panel compares metformin use to no metformin
use in males only. The bottom panel compares metformin use to no metformin use in females onluy. In
both panels, the blue line represents no metformin use and the red line represent metformin use. The Y
axis is survival, the X axis is hospital days.
Figure 3. Bar graph comparing survival among women and among men, comparing those without
metformin to those with metformin. The left two columns are women, without and with metformin,
analyzed by cox proportional hazards. The 3rd and 4th columns (blue) are men, without and with
metformin, analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards. The 5th and 6th columns (light orange), are women,
without and with metformin, analyzed by propensity matching. The 7th and 8th columns (blue) are men,
without and with metformin, analyzed by propensity matching.
