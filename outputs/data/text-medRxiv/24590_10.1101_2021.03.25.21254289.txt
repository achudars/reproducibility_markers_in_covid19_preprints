On the association between SARS-COV-2 variants and COVID-19 mortality during the
second wave of the pandemic in Europe

Abstract
BACKGROUND: Preliminary clinical evidence suggests an increased COVID-19 mortality associated with the
variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1. The evidence outside the UK and a real-world comparison of variants spread and
mortality is sparse. This study aims at investigating the association between COVID-19 mortality and SARS-COV-2
variants spread during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.
METHODS: For 38 European countries, publicly available data were collected on numbers of COVID-19 deaths,
SARS-COV-2 variants spread through time using Nextstrain classification and countries’ demographic and health
characteristics. The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths and the height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak during
the second wave of the pandemic were considered as outcomes. Pearson correlations and multivariate generalized
linear models with selection algorithms were used.
FINDINGS: The average proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant (B.1.1.7) was found to be a significant predictor of
cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths within two months before the deaths peak and between 1 January – 25
February 2021, as well as of the deaths' peak height when calculating the proportion during the second wave and the
pre-peak period. The average proportion of 20A.EU2 variant (S:477N) was a significant predictor of cumulative
COVID-19 deaths in the pre-peak period.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that the spread of a new variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1 had a significant
impact on the mortality during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and that proportions of 20A.EU2
and 20I/501Y.V1 variants were associated with increased mortality in the initial phase of that wave.
KEYWORDS: COVID-19, mortality, SARS-COV-2 variants, variant of concern.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Emerging evidence suggests that the new variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) may be associated with an
increased risk of death. The 20A.EU2 variant (S:447N), observed firstly in July 2020 in western Europe, was found
to be capable of increasing SARS-COV-2 infectivity. The evidence outside the UK is still sparse, same as a real-world
comparison of distinct variants spread and mortality through time.
Added value of this study
In this study we investigated whether the change of the proportion of any SARS-COV-2 variant, including
20I/501Y.V1 and 11 other variants identified by Nextstrain up to 25 February 2021, has an association with COVID19 cumulative mortality or with the height of the second wave COVID-19 mortality peak.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our findings shed light on the causes of the increased COVID-19 mortality during the second wave of the pandemic
in Europe. It shows the need for early containment strategies when the variant 20I/501Y.V1 emerges. These findings
also support the need for systematic SARS-CoV-2 regular genome sequencing to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
After a year since the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has been announced as a pandemic
by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020,1 there is still a growing interest in monitoring the virus

spread and investigating factors which can have an impact on disease mortality. 2-5 The situation seems to have
worsened in countries where new variants emerged (Brazil, UK, US).6-8 In the UK the new SARS-CoV-2 “variant of
concern” (VOC) has been identified on 20 September 2020 (20I/501Y.V1 or B.1.1.7 mutation or UKV). 7
As reported by the Public Health England (PHE), an increased risk of hospitalization and transmissibility has been
detected for VOC B.1.1.7.9 Emerging evidence suggests that the “UKV” may be associated with an increased risk of
death.10-13 Apart from that, earlier identified variant 20A.EU2 (mutation S:447N), observed firstly in July 2020 in
western Europe, was found to be capable of increasing SARS-COV-2 infectivity.14,15 Besides newly identified
mutations, it cannot be ignored that SARS-COV-2 variants developed during the 1st wave can also have impact on the
mortality during the second wave.
Since the preliminary clinical evidence supports the hypothesis of an increased mortality associated with the
20I/501Y.V1 VOC in the UK, a broader view on the problem is of public health interest. The evidence on the actual
impact of the UKV outside the UK is still sparse. Therefore, in this study we collected country-level data on the
COVID-19 mortality during the second (winter) wave of the pandemic in Europe and investigated whether the change
of the proportion of any SARS-COV-2 variant, including the UKV and 11 other variants identified by Nextstrain up
to 25 February 202116,17, has an association with COVID-19 cumulative mortality or with the height of the second
wave COVID-19 mortality peak.
This study aims at detecting potential association between COVID-19 mortality and proportion of SARS-COV-2
variants through the second wave of the pandemic in Europe with the use of multivariate regression models. To the
best of our knowledge, the problem has not been investigated so far in this broader context. This analysis enables us
to fill the gap in evidence and shed light on the causes of the increased COVID-19 mortality during the second wave
and through the first months of 2021 in Europe.

Methods
Data collection
A total of 38 European countries were included in the analysis. The cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths during
the second (winter 2020/2021) wave of COVID-19 pandemic was the primary outcome of interest. The secondary
outcome of interest was the height of COVID-19 daily deaths peak during the second wave, defined as maximum
daily reported number of people who died due to COVID-19 per country, considering the period from start of the
second wave to 25 February 2021.
As the start of the second wave is not easily determined, we approximated this date as the median date between 1st
wave daily deaths peak height (no later than mid-June 2020) and second wave daily deaths peak height (no sooner
than mid-August 2020) when a minimum number of deaths per day ±0.1 deaths per 1 mln inhabitants was observed.
Values of cumulative number of deaths and deaths peak height were divided by the number of inhabitants of a given
country and reported as number of deaths per 1 million inhabitants.
The main explanatory variables of interest, assumed to have a potential association with the above outcomes, were
average proportions of SARS-COV-2 sequences among identified sequences in the same period used to form
Nextstrain clades. Twelve (12) clades (19A, 19B, 20A, 20A.EU1, 20B, 20C, 20D, 20E.EU2, 20G, 20H/501Y.V2,
20I/501Y.V1, 20J/501Y.V3) were identified by Nextstrain from December 2019 to March 2021 in the European
region. 16,17
Four time periods were considered to analyze the association between outcomes and average proportions of each clade
(virus variant) through time:
•
•
•
•

From start of the second wave up to second wave COVID-19 daily deaths peak,
Within two months before reaching the second wave COVID-19 daily deaths peak,
In the period between 1 January 2021 to 25 February 2021,
From start of the second wave up to 25 February 2021.

Additional covariates considered in the analysis were: country population size, cumulative number of COVID-19
deaths during the 1st wave of the pandemic, cumulative number of vaccinated people up to the end of considered
period, all beds capacity (number of hospital bed units), percentage of population living in metropolitan cities with
more than 1 million inhabitants, percentage of population aged 65 or more, prevalence of diabetes, cancer and obesity

(2017) and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (2019). These factors were assessed as significantly impacting
the risk of severe illness or mortality from COVID-19 in the literature. 4,18-20
Variables indicating deaths, vaccinated people and beds capacity were considered in relation to the population size of
a country.
Data sources
Data on COVID-19 deaths, infections and beds capacity were obtained from Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation (IHME) on 25 February 2021.21 Daily number of deaths were recalculated using 7-day moving average to
minimize bias related to possible reporting fluctuations.
A dataset of 3971 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains identified between December 2019 and March 2021, used to form clades
of virus variants, was downloaded from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database
(https://www. gisaid.org) on 12 March 2021. 22 In particular, the dataset included information on date and country
where a given strain was observed, as well as GISAID and Nextstrain clade to which a given strain was classified. We
assumed that if a strain was observed on a given date, it could be observed in a range of ±14 days from the observation
date. Since the data are not reported daily, the assumption helps to avoid fluctuations.
Data on number of vaccinated people were taken from Our World In Data. 23 Data on population size were taken from
Worldometer.com.24 Data on the population living in metropolitan areas were downloaded from Eurostat and other
sources. 4,19,20,25 Data on prevalence of diseases, gross domestic product (GDP) and population age were downloaded
from Our World In Data and World Bank websites. 26,27
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics on outcomes and explanatory variables (N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) were
calculated across European countries for each of considered time periods.
Pearson correlations between average virus variants proportions (raw proportions included in a range [0, 1]) and
cumulative deaths and/or deaths peak height were analyzed. Then, multivariate general linear models (GLMs) with a
normal distribution function and logistic link function were run using stepwise selection algorithms, to select
significant variables and avoid potential bias due to relatively low sample size. A criterion of having p-value lower
than 0·1 was applied for each variable to stay in and to enter a model. Variants with mean proportion across countries
lower than 0·01 during a considered period were not included in the multivariate analysis. If more than one variant
proportion were found significant in a model, Pearson correlations between them were verified.
Additionally, sensitivity analysis of covariates selection was performed using the genetic algorithm applied on the
GLM models, with the best model selected based on the value of Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) corrected for
small sample sizes (AICC). Models with only main effects were considered.
Given a country-level analysis, Moran’s I and Geary’s C statistics28,29 were produced to check the spatial
autocorrelation in values of outcomes and to determine if it should be considered in final models.
For all analyses, a p-value lower than 0·05 was considered as statistically significant.
Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 software. R 3.6.2 was used to apply the genetic algorithm.

Results
Descriptive statistics
Descriptive statistics of the average proportion of virus variants and outcomes for each of considered time periods
are presented in Table 1. Plots presenting the change of proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant through time is presented
on Figure 1, and on Figure 2 for the UK.
Moran’s I and Geary’s C statistics for study outcomes indicated a significant spatial autocorrelation in almost all cases
(Table 2), therefore all final GLMs selected with the use of selection algorithms were further accounted for the spatial
autocorrelation.

Base case analysis
Pearson correlations
Significant positive correlations between the average proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant of concern and cumulative
number of COVID-19 deaths were observed during the time periods: from start of the second wave to the second wave
peak (0·39, p=0·017), within two months before the second wave peak (0·32, p=0·047) and between 1 January – 25
February 2021 (0·47, p=0·003).
A significant negative correlation between the average proportion of 20A variant and second wave deaths peak height
was observed for the period from start of the second wave up to the peak (-0·47, p=0·002), whereas its correlation
with cumulative number of deaths during that period was close to reaching the significance (-0·32, p=0·051).
Considering the entire second wave period, a negative correlation between the average proportion of 20A variant and
second wave deaths peak height was closed to reaching the significance (-0·30, p=0·066).
No other significant (p<0·05) or close to significant (p<0·1) correlations were observed for any variants within all
considered time periods.
Multivariate analysis
From second wave start to the deaths peak
The average proportion of 20A.EU2 variant was found to be significant in the GLM model with stepwise selection of
cumulative number of deaths during the period from second wave start to the deaths peak, with a positive estimate
(1·00, p=0·011; respectively; Table 3). Considering the same period, average proportions of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20A
variants were found to be significantly related to the second wave deaths peak height, with a positive estimate for the
former and a negative for the latter variant (3·06, p=0·004; -1·00, p=0·035; respectively; Table 3). It should be noted
that average proportions of both variants during this period were not correlated (Pearson corr. = -0·03, p=0·85).
Within two months before the deaths peak
For the period of two months before the peak, the average proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20A.EU2 variants were
selected as significant predictors of cumulative number of deaths during that period (1·41, p<0·001; 0·99, p=0·001;
respectively; Table 4), and the proportions were not correlated (Pearson corr. = - 0·18, p=0·28). The 20A.EU2
proportion was also found significant in the model of the deaths’ peak height (1·29, p=0·004; Table 4).
1 January – 25 February 2021
The selected GLM model of cumulative deaths for 1st of January – 25th of February 2021 includes the average
proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant (1·42, p<0·001; Table 5).
From second wave start to 25 February 2021
Finally, considering the entire period of the second wave up to 25 February 2021, the average proportion of
20I/501Y.V1 variant was selected as a significant predictor of the deaths peak height (2·37, p=0·023; Table 6), but
was not selected into the model of cumulative deaths.
Sensitivity analysis
Cumulative deaths
Considering periods from second wave start to the peak, as well as between 1 January – 25 February 2021, same
models of cumulative deaths were selected by the genetic algorithm and the stepwise algorithm, suggesting their best
fit based on the AICC criterion.
For the period of two months before the deaths peak, genetic algorithm selected a similar model of cumulative deaths
as the stepwise algorithm but with one additional variable, percentage of people aged 65 or more. AICC of the model
was only slightly better than for the stepwise model (506·70 vs 506·73). However, proportions of 20I/501Y.V1 and
20A.EU2 variants remained significant (1·49, p<0·001; 0·89, p=0·009; respectively; Table 7).
For the period from second wave start to 25 February 2021, the genetic algorithm selected a similar model of
cumulative deaths as the stepwise algorithm, with GDP per capita (1 mln USD) and additionally, the percentage of
people aged 65 or more (Table 8).
Deaths peak height
For all considered periods, the genetic algorithm selected the same models of the COVID-19 deaths’ peak height as
the stepwise algorithm.

Discussion
In this study we investigated the association between the change of SARS-COV-2 variants proportions through time
and COVID-19 cumulative mortality, and the height of the second wave COVID-19 mortality peak. The latter outcome
is an indicator of mortality magnitude which can be viewed as less subject to deviations from between-country
differences in reporting, not depending on the date up to which the analysis is performed and enabling to assess the
overall capacity of healthcare systems.4
Our study provides evidence that higher proportion of the VOC 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) across countries is associated
with higher COVID-19 mortality peak and cumulative mortality during the second wave of the pandemic in Europe.
An increase of 0.1 in the proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 variant, considering the pre-peak period, was found to be
associated with 35·8% increase in the height of the second wave peak. During the period from 1 January to 25 February
2021, an increase of 0.1 in the proportion of the same VOC was related with a 15·3% increase in the cumulative
number of deaths during that period.
These results support previous findings suggesting the increased risk of dying due to B.1.1.7 variant in the UK. The
UK’s governmental New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) reports the results
of the matched cohort analysis in which a death risk ratio for VOC-infected individuals compared to non-VOC was
1·65 (95% confidence interval (CI) = [1·21; 2·25]). 13 Results of a case control study conducted by Challen (et al.,
2021) suggest that the mortality hazard ratio associated with infection with VOC B.1.1.7 was 1·64 (95% CI = [1·32;
2·04]) compared to infection with previously circulating variants. 12 Wallace and Ackland (2021) compared the number
of deaths in the UK detected before and after new VOC detection. In early-December 2020 deaths ratio was
significantly higher compared to the ratio in October-November 2021, especially in regions affected by the VOC
B.1.1.7.11
Results of the current study also suggest that the higher proportion of 20A.EU2 variant (mutation S:447N) was
associated with increased mortality in the pre-peak phase of the second wave of COVID-19 in the European region.
It is complementary to the previous findings that this variant is able to attenuate neutralizing immune responses in
humans, studied by Liu (et al., 2020).14
The proportion of 20A variant, firstly observed in Europe during the 1 st wave of the pandemic (February 2020), was
found to be negatively associated with the deaths peak height considering the pre-peak phase of the second wave.
While the proportion of 20I/501Y.V1 was positively associated with this outcome, and since no correlation between
proportion of 20A and 20I/501Y.V1 was observed in that period, then it can suggest that higher frequency of variants
developed during the 1st wave, such as 20A, could potentially be protective during the pre-peak phase of the second
wave, due to the fact that societies could have already gained some level of immunity. However, this hypothesis needs
further investigations.
We found GISAID to be a reliable source of data on SARS-COV-2 variants spread. The GISAID aims to rapidly share
data from influenza viruses and the coronavirus causing COVID-19, including genetic sequence, as well as clinical
and epidemiological data associated with human viruses, in order to help researchers understand viruses evolution and
spread during epidemics.30 SARS-COV-2 variants’ classification used in this study was developed by Nextstrain
group. Nextstrain is an open-source project providing real-time analysis of evolving pathogens of the coronavirus and
several other human viruses using publicly available data. Nextstrain sheds light on evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses
from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 variants were grouped into
clades.16,17 More information on clades were obtained from CoVariants, developed by Emma Hodcroft in 2020. The
website provides an overview of SARS-CoV-2 variants of the Nextstrain clades, summarizes information on mutations
defining each variant, and describes its evolution through the pandemic.15
Limitations
One of the study limitations is that data on limited number of countries were used. Since the course of the pandemic
differs sorely between continents, and so do the virus variants spread, we focused on the European region to avoid
data inconsistency issues. However, the number of observations is enough to draw conclusions based on multivariate
regression models. Stability of results was tested with sensitivity analyses, being highly consistent with base case
findings.

The limited number of covariates were included in the multivariate analysis, while other factors could be potentially
influential. The selection of covariates was based on the literature search and only factors which previously were
found to have a significant association with COVID-19 mortality were included.
Another limitation concerns the reliability of the data. The proportions of variants were calculated across strains
obtained from GISAID and sampling of virus strains may not be equal across countries. However, the number of
countries with less than 30 observations was only 5 (13·2%), and the average number of sequences per country in the
database was 64.
There also exists the variability of data quality between countries, as well as between-country differences on data on
daily deaths due to COVID-19 collection methods. In addition, the date of death occurrence and date of reporting can
differ.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the development and spread of a new virus variant of concern 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7) had a
significant impact on the mortality during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. It can contribute to
explain the persistent high mortality post peak of the second wave and during the first two months of 2021.
Moreover, the frequency of both the novel VOC, as well as of earlier identified 20A.EU2 (S:447N) variant could have
a potential influence on excess mortality during the initial phase of the second wave, before reaching the deaths peak.
