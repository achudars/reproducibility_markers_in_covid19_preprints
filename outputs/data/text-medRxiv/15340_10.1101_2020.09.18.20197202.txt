What is the key question?

How has the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown affected exacerbation patterns and behaviour in

patients with COPD?

What is the bottom line?

A 38% increase in the number of community treated exacerbations was seen in 2020

compared with 2019. Increased symptoms of anxiety were seen in patients, alongside

increased inhaler adherence and reduced physical activity.

Why read on?

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in treatment for

exacerbations of COPD in the community, as well as increased anxiety amongst patients.

ABSTRACT

Introduction: The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and lockdown measures, on acute

exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD

treatment frequency during the first six weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019

and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being.

Methods: In this observational study patients with established COPD were recruited.

Exacerbation frequency was measured in the first six weeks of COVID lockdown and

compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records.

A telephone survey

was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, shopping and

visitor behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal.

Results: 160 participants were recruited (mean [SD] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male,

FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted) and 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous

year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared

with 2019 (126 vs 99, p=0.026). The increase was as a result of multiple courses of

treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% vs

33.8%).

During “lockdown” participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their

preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant

reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001).

Discussion: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first six weeks of the SARS-

CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019. This was associated with increased symptoms

of anxiety and significant behavioural change.

INTRODUCTION

Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) are a frequent

problem for people with COPD, adversely affecting morbidity and mortality and are an

1

important cause of unscheduled healthcare contacts including admission to hospital . The

Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD) report grades the severity of these events according to

treatment requirement, defining moderate events as those needing community provision of

2

oral antibiotics and corticosteroids and severe events as those requiring hospitalisation .

Healthcare provision for people with COPD has been impacted by the Severe Acute

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic through the requirement for

more distant/remote contact with the healthcare team to reduce the risk of virus

3

transmission . Additionally, because of the appreciation of a greater risk of morbidity from

SARS-CoV-2 infection

4

more stringent social isolation has been recommended for people

with COPD during the period of societal lockdown that has been implemented in most

countries affected by the pandemic. In the UK this has been termed “shielding” and includes

advice against leaving home for any reason other than for essential work or shopping with

very limited exceptions.

During this time healthcare professionals, providing care for people with COPD have

reported lower than expected presentation rates for AECOPD in both community and acute

hospital settings

56

. However, it is unclear whether this is due to a genuine reduction in

AECOPD rates (potentially due to lower respiratory viral transmission

7

and/or atmospheric

pollution) or due to higher thresholds for patient reporting to healthcare services because of

fearfulness about contracting SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare environments, particular hospitals.

In addition there is limited understanding of the impact of enhanced shielding on the

. Having a chronic condition such as COPD does not appear to increase the

likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection

, it does convey increased risk of hospitalisation and

death .

Firstly, in this observational study we recorded the change in moderate and severe AECOPD

treatment frequency (assessed objectively through prescription records or requirement for

hospitalisation) during the first six weeks of societal lockdown in the UK compared with the

equivalent period 12 months previously. Secondly, we assessed self-reported behaviour

change during the pre-lockdown and lockdown period by telephone interview in order to

explore potential reasons for any observed changes in AECOPD treatment frequency

METHODS

Study Design

We compared rates of treatment for exacerbations of COPD managed in the community and

hospital setting between the first six-week period of the SARS-CoV-2 “lockdown” in England

(15

March 2020 to 30

March 2019 to 30

April 2020) with the same six-week period the previous year (15

th

April 2019).

Participants were prospectively recruited between 2

nd

June, 2020 and 8

th

July, 2020 and

provided informed consent. Ethics approval was granted by the London-Brent Research

Ethics Committee (REF 20/HRA/2510).

Electronic community prescription records were used to record community exacerbation

events and electronic hospital records similarly for hospital exacerbations. The terms

study due to the known change in hospital admission criteria during the peak of the SARS-

CoV-2 pandemic in England when hospital bed capacity was considered of critical

importance. Community managed exacerbations were defined as those resulting in a

prescription for oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics but without hospital admission.

Hospitalised exacerbations were defined as admissions to hospital with a recorded

discharge diagnosis of Acute Exacerbation of COPD.

As an additional analysis a telephone survey was conducted to explore potential reasons for

differences in exacerbation risk. Participants were asked to compare behavioural and

emotional changes with their baseline “normal” state as a reference. Participants were

asked to compare two discrete periods; (1) pre-lockdown, defined as the two weeks prior to

“lockdown” (1

st

March 2020 to 14

th

March 2020) when participants were likely to be more

aware of the threat of SARS-CoV-2 but restrictions had not yet been placed and (2) the

“lockdown” itself (15

th

March 2020 to 30

th

April 2020). Self-reported behaviour included;

medication adherence to their regular prescribed inhaled therapy, anxiety, self-reported

change in activity levels, and social behaviour (self-isolation, shielding, visitors to the home,

arrangements for shopping). Answers were captured with either a binary response (yes/no)

or on a five-point Likert scale (see online supplement for full details of questionnaire used).

Study Population

Participants were eligible if they had a confirmed diagnosis of COPD, under a specialist

COPD clinic (Complex COPD clinic, Leicester, UK

11

), and able to provide informed verbal

consent via English language telephone consultation. All patients had confirmed airflow

obstruction. Patients were contacted sequentially from the research database held in our

centre of patients who have previously consented to be contacted for research until this list

was exhausted. The telephone call was made by either a nurse or doctor and participants

gave informed consent verbally with this documented by the investigator due to the remote

nature of the consultation.

Electronic GP and hospital healthcare records were used to capture new prescriptions for

oral antibiotics or corticosteroids during the periods of interest, hospital admissions, as well

as baseline characteristics, including latest spirometry. All spirometry had been performed

at their previous clinic visit to Glenfield Hospital, Leicester to ERS/ATS standard

12

.

Statistical Analysis

Baseline data were described as mean (standard deviation), or n (%) as appropriate. Paired

data were compared using a paired t-test or signed-rank test for parametric data and non-

parametric data respectively. Categorical data were compared using chi squared. Statistical

analysis was performed using STATA 16 (StataCorp, USA).

From previous data from our COPD clinic we anticipated 0.8 exacerbations per patient in the

observation period with a SD of 0.9. To detect a 25% difference in exacerbations within

patients between 2019 and 2020 then 160 participants would be required (alpha=0.05,

power 80%).

RESULTS

160 patients were recruited with baseline characteristics outlined in table 1. 140 (88%)

reported at least one exacerbation in the previous year, and the majority 103 (64%)

reported at least two. 149 (93%) patients were prescribed triple inhaled therapy and 138

(86%) were classed as GOLD stage 3 or 4 airflow obstruction.

received treatment (34.4% in 2020 vs 33.8% in 2019) while those who received at least one

course more likely to receive more separate courses of treatment (table 2).

Unsurprisingly, community managed events comprised the majority of exacerbations

(209/224, 93%). For community exacerbations alone 121 events were noted in 2020

compared with 88 in 2019 (p=0.004) (figure 1b). There were 5 hospitalisations (n=5) due to

AECOPD during the lockdown period in 2020, compared to 10 hospitalisations (n=9) in the

same period in 2019 (figure 1c).

Medication Adherence

In the two weeks prior to lockdown 131 (83%) participants reported using their

maintenance inhalers with the same frequency as they would during their stable state. 23

participants (14%) reporting increased use and 4 (2.5%) using less frequently than normal.

During the lockdown period 42 (26%) participants reported increased use, 113 (71%)

participants reported the same frequency of use and 4 (2.5%) reported using their regular

inhaler less frequently than baseline (p<0.001) (figure 2a).

45 (28%) participants reported having more anxiety about their COPD than normal during

the pre-lockdown period compared to baseline, of which 42/45 (93%) reported anxiety as a

“little more” than baseline and 3/45 (7%) as “much more”. During the lockdown period 92

(58%) reported increased anxiety compared to normal (p<0.001), of which 48/92 (52%)

were “a little more” anxious and 42/92 (48%) “much more” anxious (figure 2b).

Participants were also asked if they would avoid coming to hospital as an emergency during

the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to fear of COVID-19. 64 (40%) reported they

would have avoided doing so during the pre-lockdown and 90 (56%) reported they would

avoid emergency hospital attendance during the lockdown period (p<0.001).

Physical activity and exercise

83 (54%) reported physical activity was unchanged compared to normal during the pre-

lockdown period with 63 (40%) reporting reduced activity and 11 (7%) reporting increased

activity levels. This contrasted sharply to the lockdown period where only 26 (16%) reported

maintaining the same level of activity as normal while 52 (32.5%) reported slightly less and

78 (49%) reported doing a lot less physical activity than normal implying a significant

decrease in activity levels (p<0.001). Only 4 (2%) reported increased physical activity levels

(figure 2c). When asked about participation in a home exercise program, 50 (31%) patients

and 56 (35%) patients reported participating in a home exercise program during the pre-

lockdown and lockdown periods respectively.

Shopping behaviour

Participants were asked about shopping behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown

periods with a significant change being noted; during the pre-lockdown 89 (55.6%) reported

going shopping themselves, while 33 (20.6%) reported that this was performed by someone

who lives in the house with them and 38 (23.8%) reported it being completed by someone

who does not live with them or being delivered to them. In contrast to this, during the

lockdown only 11 (6.9%) reported that they still did their own shopping, with 37 (23.1%)

having this task completed by someone living in their home and 112 (70%) reporting that it

was done by someone who does not live in their home or delivered (pre-lockdown to

lockdown, p<0.001).

Shielding and visitors

In the pre-lockdown period 142 (88.8%) participants reported continuing normal behaviour

with only 16 (10%) shielding. Once lockdown started only 7 (4.4%) reported continuing

normal behaviour while 127 (79.9%) reported that they were shielding (p<0.001).

During the pre-lockdown period 146 (91.3%) reported that they had visitors to their home

compared to 31 (19.4%) during the lockdown (p<0.001).

DISCUSSION

In this observational study a 38% increase in community managed exacerbation events

during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 was seen compared to the same six-week period in

2019, as measured by primary care prescription records. The number of patients suffering

an exacerbation was unchanged. Self-reported anxiety and inhaler adherence increased

whereas PA was lower initially during the pre-lockdown period, but most pronounced

during lockdown.

Severe exacerbations, as measured by hospital admissions, were seen within the cohort and

represented 6% of all exacerbations. We observed a 50% decrease in hospital managed

AECOPD events during the COVID-19 lockdown compared the same dates in 2019, though

our study was insufficiently powered. A recent larger study, comparing hospital events,

rather than individual patients, confirm our observations with a similar reduction in AECOPD

6

admission rates . This may represent an effect of the increased use of rescue medications in

the community resulting in reduced need for hospital admissions, though other factors are

also likely to have played a role.

This is the first report of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (and consequent societal

lockdown) on objectively measured AECOPD rates. Our findings contrasts to reports of

5

reduced AECOPD events during the lockdown with physicians and COPD nursing teams .

Interestingly we did not observe an increase in the proportion of patients requiring rescue

medication, but an increase in the number of multiple courses. Possible explanations for

these findings may result from either biological or behavioural differences. Patients who

would normally have been admitted to hospital with an exacerbation may have been

managed in the community during the pandemic because of a combination of fearfulness on

the part of the patient about transmission risk in hospital and a desire on the part of

healthcare teams to reserve hospital bed capacity to manage patients suffering with COVID-

19 pneumonia. This Behavioural explanation appears plausible, particularly as there was

increased access to healthcare services via telephone consultations and reduced physical

access to clinicians

13

. National guidance, updated in 2018, recommended an “action plan”

which includes oral corticosteroids and antibiotics to be self-administered in the event of an

14

AECOPD

. Increased concerns on the part of clinicians about the risks of hospitalisation in a

patient population perceived to be at greater risk from SARS-CoV-2 might have lowered

thresholds for prescribing action plans. Patient concern that access to primary or secondary

healthcare teams and pharmacies might be restricted might also have resulted in stockpiling

behaviour during the pandemic

15

with patients potentially requesting multiple “rescue

packs” to store in case they were unable to obtain these later.

It is possible that the biological triggers for exacerbation events reduced for some patients

because of lower respiratory virus transmission and air pollution during lockdown. However,

our data suggest that this was outweighed by events driven by non-inflammatory causes,

termed “pauci-inflammatory”

corticosteroids

16

, which may be less responsive to oral antibiotics or

17

. This is supported by our observation that the majority of participants

reported increasing anxiety about their COPD, particularly during the lockdown period. This

would support the view that the most likely reason for the observed increase in

exacerbations may be underpinned by behavioural change and concerns around COPD and

emergency healthcare. It also highlights the need for potential psychological support in a

vulnerable population, where anxiety and depression are common

18

.

In addition, it is clear from our data that adherence to shielding advice was widespread,

likely reflecting a shared concern among patients about risks from COVID-19. Likewise, we

observed an increase in self-reported inhaler compliance suggesting greater health concern

and vigilance.

We also observed a greater dependence on others for day to day activities such as shopping

and an overall reduction in physical activity among this cohort of patients with COPD that

contrasts to that reported amongst the general population during the lockdown

19

. While

this study did not directly assess the effect of this reduction in physical activity it raises the

additional possibility that exacerbation events increased because of increased

breathlessness and reduced resilience due to deconditioning and sarcopenia

20,21

. The longer

term consequences of such altered activity behaviours remains to be seen but is of

significant concern given the difficulty in providing timely and effective pulmonary

rehabilitation in the context of the pandemic

.

At the time of writing, we are approaching winter in the northern hemisphere and no SARS-

CoV-2 vaccine has yet been demonstrated to be safe and effective

23

, exacerbations of COPD

are likely to increase with this season and result in increased hospitalisation. This study is a

timely reminder that increased understanding of community prescribing practice and

patient behaviour are important and may reveal effective tools in reducing morbidity and

mortality in this group. Firstly, patients with COPD are going to require ongoing support and

treatment, even if they are less likely to present to specialist or hospital services. Previous

evidence has shown that pandemic influenza poses a significant risk to patients with COPD

24

with the consequence that viral pandemics such as SARS-CoV-2 are likely to pose a similar

risk. Developing robust and accessible systems to acutely review patients with COPD

remotely to guide them in their use of rescue and preventer medication may reduce

symptom burden, hospital admissions and unnecessary courses of potentially harmful oral

corticosteroids and antibiotics. It is less likely that the increased number of moderate

exacerbations recorded from our prescription data represent an increase in airway

inflammation but rather a composite of increased anxiety and caution with the aim of

preventing hospital admissions and the consequence that other, non-pharmacological,

interventions may have been effective in managing these events

24

.

The conclusions drawn from this study are limited by both the relatively small sample size

and the severity of the COPD seen in the cohort recruited. Though 160 patients has

provided adequate power for statistically significant differences in community treated

exacerbation and behavioural changes it has not been sufficiently large to detect changes in

hospitalised events which would be better evaluated using larger datasets. In addition to

this the cohort had established COPD, under a specialist secondary care clinic, so results

may not be applicable to those with milder disease, and less frequent exacerbations. Finally,

patients recruited needed to be alive during the period of recruitment in May and June

2020, meaning that there may be survivor bias compared to those that died in 2019 and

during the peak of the pandemic.

In summary, this study revealed an increase in treatment for community treated AECOPD

events among patients with severe COPD during the SAR-CoV-2 lockdown. This finding was

unexpected but may be explained by factors such as anxiety, which was increased in our

patient cohort. Significant behaviour changes including reduced physical activity, adherence

to shielding advice and increased inhaler compliance.
