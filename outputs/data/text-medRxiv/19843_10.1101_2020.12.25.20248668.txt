Brief Abstract
We analysed SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and contact tracing data from Karnataka, India up to 21 July 2020.
We estimated metrics of infectiousness and the tendency for superspreading (overdispersion), and
evaluated potential determinants of infectiousness and symptomaticity in COVID-19 cases. Among 956
cases confirmed to be forward-traced, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all
secondary cases, suggesting significant heterogeneity in individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in underlying number of contacts. Secondary
attack rate was 3.6% among 16715 close contacts. Transmission was higher when index case was aged
>18 years, or was symptomatic (adjusted risk ratio, aRR 3.63), or was lab-confirmed ≥4 days after
symptom onset (aRR 3.01). Probability of symptomatic infection increased with age, and symptomatic
infectors were 8.16 times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. This could potentially cause
a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission generations; further
studies are suggested to confirm this. Mean serial interval was 5.4 days. Adding backward contact tracing
and targeting control measures to curb super-spreading may be prudent. Due to low symptomaticity and
infectivity, interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing
transmission.

Structured Abstract
Background: India has experienced the second largest outbreak of COVID-19 globally, yet there is a
paucity of studies analysing contact tracing data in the region. Such studies can elucidate essential
transmission metrics which can help optimize disease control policies.
Methods: We analysed contact tracing data collected under the Integrated Disease Surveillance
Programme from Karnataka, India between 9 March and 21 July 2020. We estimated metrics of disease
transmission including the reproduction number (R), overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR),
and serial interval. R and k were jointly estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach.
We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the risk of transmitting the infection, probability of
asymptomatic infection, and mortality due to COVID-19.
Findings: Up to 21 July, we found 111 index cases that crossed the super-spreading threshold of ≥8
secondary cases. R and k were most reliably estimated at R 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.91) and k 0.12 (0.110.15) for confirmed traced cases (n=956); and R 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three
largest clusters (n=394). Among 956 confirmed traced cases, 8.7% of index cases had 14.4% of contacts
but caused 80% of all secondary cases. Among 16715 contacts, overall SAR was 3.6% (3.4-3.9) and
symptomatic cases were more infectious than asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.044.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44 years, children were less infectious (aRR 0.21 [0.07-0.66] for
0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Infectors who were confirmed ≥4 days after symptom

onset were associated with higher infectiousness (aRR 3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Probability of symptomatic
infection increased with age, and symptomatic infectors were 8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to
generate symptomatic secondaries. Serial interval had a mean of 5.4 (4.4-6.4) days with a Weibull
distribution. Overall case fatality rate was 2.5% (2.4-2.7) which increased with age.
Conclusion: We found significant heterogeneity in the individual-level transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2
which could not be explained by the degree of heterogeneity in the underlying number of contacts. To
strengthen contact tracing in over-dispersed outbreaks, testing and tracing delays should be minimised,
retrospective contact tracing should be considered, and contact tracing performance metrics should be
utilised. Targeted measures to reduce potential superspreading events should be implemented.
Interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2
transmission owing to their low symptomaticity and infectivity. There is some evidence that
symptomatic cases produce secondary cases that are more likely to be symptomatic themselves which
may potentially cause a snowballing effect on infectiousness and clinical severity across transmission
generations; further studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Introduction
COVID-19, a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 originated in Wuhan, China (1). As
of 18th October 2020, the disease has spread to over 200 countries and territories, causing over 39.81M
cases and 1.11M deaths of which India contributed to 7.5M cases with over 100,000 deaths. (2)
Karnataka, a south-Indian state inhabited by more than 61 million people, (3) confirmed its first COVID19 case on 9th March 2020. By 18th October, Karnataka had the third-highest COVID-19 case burden of
all states in India with 765,586 cumulative cases.
Contact tracing remains one of the key public health responses in infectious disease control with a history
that can be traced back to the late 19th century. (4) In the present COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing
may achieve significant outbreak control when effective reproduction number is lower due to social
distancing and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). (5) In addition, primary contact tracing data is
extremely valuable in elucidating transmission characteristics of an infectious disease which can be used
to inform policy.
A disease’s basic reproductive number R0 describes the ‘average’ number of secondary infections
(offsprings) generated by a single infected individual. Super-spreader events (SSEs) highlight a major
limitation of the concept of R0, which is an average and does not capture the heterogeneity of
infectiousness. (6) Each infected case does not produce R0 offspring; a small number of individuals may
be responsible for a large percentage of secondary infections, whereas most others infect no one. When
this occurs, the offspring distribution is said to be overdispersed. The dispersion parameter, k is smaller
when superspreading plays a larger role in transmission. Studying overdispersion is crucial since most
of the transmission can be eliminated if events and settings conducive to superspreading can be limited
by implementing targeted measures, as opposed to overarching policies that would be needed if
overdispersion was low and transmission was homogeneous. (7,8)
Serial interval, defined as the interval between symptom onset of the index case and the secondary case
in a transmission chain, is a key epidemiological measure that determines the spread of an infectious
disease. The serial interval is an essential metric in epidemic transmission models and in estimating
reproduction numbers used to evaluate the impact of interventions and to inform policy response. (9)
Studies across the world estimate the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 between 3.9-7.5 days. (10) Estimation
requires high quality data from primary contact tracing which establishes linkage between transmission
pairs and thus, data-backed evidence of serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 in India and other low-resource
settings is extremely limited if any. Whereas the secondary attack rate which measures the risk of
infection in contacts has been studied in India by Laxminarayanan et al., (11) a comprehensive study
looking at superspreading, overdispersion and serial interval has not yet been done in India, mostly
owing to a lack of data.
Contact tracing of COVID-19 in Karnataka was driven by multi-sectoral teams and backed by technology,
enabling the state to have one of India's most effective contact tracing systems, at least during the early

epidemic. (12) Among all Indian states, Karnataka was found to have the highest quality of COVID-19
data reporting in daily bulletins released by the state government. (13) In this study, we aimed to gain
insights for disease control by understanding the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 based on
surveillance and tracing data from Karnataka. We estimated the reproduction number (R),
overdispersion (k), secondary attack rate (SAR), and serial interval from data and reconstructed major
transmission networks. We evaluated the effect of age and other factors on the probability of
asymptomatic infection, risk of transmitting the infection further, and mortality due to COVID-19. We
also attempt to quantify the effect of contact tracing on reducing onward transmission and on minimising
testing delays.

Methods
Data sources
We used data generated through surveillance activities undertaken by the Integrated Disease
Surveillance Program (IDSP) and the Department of Health and Family Welfare in accordance with
national and state policies. Data was de-identified before extraction and analysis. We created a composite
dataset by combining daily COVID-19 bulletins (14) released by the Government of Karnataka (up to 21
July 2020, after which individual case details were not available in daily bulletins) and linelist contact
tracing data maintained by the state’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (up to 1 June 2020).
(15) For confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 March to 21 July 2020 (n=71068), the government bulletins
included the unique patient ID, age, sex, district of reporting, case outcome (followed up till 23 August),
the unique ID of upstream contact (if known), travel history (if any), and case surveillance definition (if
assigned). For confirmed cases from 9 March to 1 June 2020 (n=3404), the IDSP linelist added the
symptom status (asymptomatic or symptomatic) at time of sample collection, date of symptom onset
(n=261/308 symptomatic cases), date of sample collection and test results, and number of contacts
traced (n=956/3404 cases). The two datasets were merged using the unique patient IDs which were
common to both datasets. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines. (16)
Case identification and contact tracing
The criteria for administering a COVID-19 test were periodically updated by the Indian Council of Medical
Research (table S1). (17) A contact was defined as any individual who has been exposed to a confirmed
case anytime between 2 days prior to symptom onset (in the positive case) and date of isolation (or
maximum 14 days after onset of symptoms). All contacts were quarantined and monitored for 14 days.
The duration (>15 minutes), the proximity (<1 meter), and the nature of exposure were taken into
consideration when defining a contact. (18) Contacts were further divided into high-risk or low-risk
contacts (supplementary S1). A COVID-19 test was administered to all symptomatic contacts and highrisk asymptomatic contacts between day 5 to 10 after contact. (19) For interstate and international
travellers, screening was done at all ports of entry including airports, train stations and road checkposts

at state borders. Symptomatic travellers were tested and asymptomatic travellers were subject to 14
days of quarantine. (20) (21)
Case categorisation and ascertainment of transmission pairs
We divided all cases into four mutually exclusive categories based on origin of infection: imported
international (history of international travel within 14 days of symptom onset), imported domestic
(history of travel from other Indian states into Karnataka), local with known origin (contact with a known
COVID-19 case or present at a location or event linked to COVID-19 transmission, and no travel history
outside Karnataka), and local cases with unknown origin (no travel history outside Karnataka and could
not be traced to any known COVID-19 case or event). Additionally, we categorised cases on the basis of
their surveillance case definition at the time of first presentation: Influenza-like illness (ILI: fever ≥38 C°
and cough with onset within the last ten days), or Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI: fever ≥ 38C°
and cough with onset within the last 10 days and requires hospitalization). This categorisation was
independent of the categories based on origin and was assigned for only cases for whom this information
was available. If a newly confirmed case had a history of contact with a previously confirmed case, we
assumed that the new case acquired the infection from the previously known case; and hence linked them
together as secondary case and index case respectively (probable infector-infectee pair). If a secondary
case was in contact with 2 or more index cases, we linked the secondary case to the earliest index case.
Reproduction number (R) and overdispersion parameter (k)
We fit a negative binomial distribution to the observed offspring distribution using a Bayesian Markov
Chain Monte Carlo approach and estimated effective reproduction number (R) as the mean, and degree
of heterogeneity in transmission as the overdispersion parameter (k) of the fitted distribution. Sample
mean and 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles based on post warmup samples were used to evaluate the
posterior point estimates and 95% confidence intervals respectively. Since estimates of R and k are
sensitive to the completeness of contact tracing, we separately analysed subgroups where contact tracing
was known or expected to be comprehensive (supplementary S5 and table S2). Specific metrics of contact
tracing adequacy and performance were not available in the dataset. (22) A cluster was defined as two
or more confirmed infections with reported close contact. The superspreading threshold was defined as
an index case causing eight or more secondary infections. (6,23)
Secondary attack rate, determinants of risk of infection among contacts and risk of symptomatic
infection among cases, and case fatality rate
We computed secondary attack rates by dividing the number of positive contacts by the number of
contacts traced. Only high-risk or close contacts were included (supplementary S1). We did a
retrospective cohort analysis using a Poisson regression model to estimate adjusted relative risks of
infection in contacts, and symptomatic infection in cases as a function of the predictor variables
(supplementary S3 and S4). (24) Case fatality rate was calculated as the number of deceased cases
divided by total reported cases.

Serial interval
The serial interval was calculated as the difference between the symptom onset dates of index case and
secondary case in each transmission pair. We then fitted parametric distributions (gamma, lognormal,
and weibull) to serial interval data using the maximum likelihood method. Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) was used to choose the optimal distribution, and confidence intervals were estimated using 10000
bootstraps.
Data handling
Data collection was done in Microsoft Office Excel. Data cleaning and analysis was done in Stata 15.0 and
Python v3.6.8. Figures were prepared using matplotlib v3.3.2, seaborn 0.10.0, and GraphPad Prism 9.
Clusters were visualised using EpiContacts package in R. (25)

Results
From 9 March to 21 July 2020, Karnataka reported 71068 cases with a median age of 37 years (IQR 2750) of which 63.1% were males. Table 1 and Figure 1 give an epidemiologic summary of the studied
outbreak with time and demographic characteristics. Early in the epidemic, most cases occurred in
middle-aged adults which can be explained by their high mobility. A ‘V’ shaped pattern can be seen in

mid-June. 20.3% of all cases were detected through symptomatic surveillance (17.1% ILI and 3.2% SARI).
The median age of ILI cases was 40 (IQR 29-53) and SARI cases was 54 years (IQR 43-65). The mean
delay from symptom onset to lab confirmation (testing delay) was 5.1 (4.7-5.6) days (n=261). Local cases
with unknown origin had the longest delay among all categories at 5.7 (5.1-6.2) days (n=112). Detailed
results of various delays are given in Table S4.
Overdispersion (k), reproduction number (R), and major transmission clusters
We found 111 instances where the index case crossed the super-spreading threshold of ≥8 secondary
cases upto 21 July 2020 in Karnataka. A total of 1277 clusters were identified with 6424 linked cases till
21 July 2020 in Karnataka. There were 7 clusters with a size larger than 50 cases and 106 clusters with
more than 10 cases each. We characterised the three largest clusters including the Bellary cluster (221
cases), the Delhi convention cluster (97 cases), and the Pharmaceutical company cluster (76 cases). The
reconstructed transmission networks for these three clusters are shown in Figure 2. For 394 cases linked
to these three largest clusters, the estimated R was 0.91 (0.72-1.15) and k was 0.22 (0.17-0.27). 12.4% of
infectious cases caused 80% of all transmission, while 71.2% of cases did not lead to any further
transmission among these three clusters (figure 3D). In late-March, a cluster of infections was seeded by
travellers returning from the religious convention at Nizammudin mosque in Delhi. In the Bellary cluster,
the infection was seeded by a worker at a steel plant in Bellary (26), followed by rapid spread among the
employees living in close-contact in dormitories. The initial infections occurred in the management
department which had a high contact rate with employees from other departments thus facilitating
spread. A similar cluster was reported in Nanjangud, Mysore (27) where a pharmaceutical company
became the origin of a large cluster.

The networks indicate the heterogeneity in transmission from infected cases, with a few patients causing most secondary
cases. The Bellary cluster occurred in June and July, during which symptomatic status of cases was not available.

among [E] 53 infector-infectee pairs and [F] 51 infector-infectee pairs with positive serial intervals. 10000 bootstraps
were used for estimating the 95% confidence limits shown by the shaded bands.

For 956 cases whose contacts were confirmed to have been traced, the estimated R was 0.75 (0.62-0.91)
and k was 0.12 (0.11-0.15). 8.7% of infectious cases had 14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of all
transmission (figure 3C). On the other hand, 79.4% of cases did not lead to any further transmission
despite having 71.6% of all recorded contacts. Asymptomatic cases had a much lower R than
symptomatic cases (0.41 [0.32-0.52] vs 2.04 [1.56-2.67]), but had higher transmission heterogeneity
indicated by a lower k (0.12 [0.09-0.15] vs 0.29 [0.23-0.37]). For all cases till 13 June (n=6824), R was
0.23 (0.20-0.26) and k was 0.04 (0.03-0.04). Complete results for R and k are given in supplementary S5
and table S2.
Secondary attack rate and determinants of risk of infection among contacts
The secondary attack rate (SAR) among all close contacts was 3.6% (95%CI, 3.4-3.9). Results are
summarised in table 2 and 3. The median number of contacts identified for an index case were 11 (IQR
5-21). The median number of contacts per case were higher (15 [IQR 8-35]) when the index case was
confirmed ≥4 days after symptom onset. Symptomatic index cases were more infectious than
asymptomatic cases (SAR 7.7% vs 2.0%; aRR 3.63 [3.04-4.34]). As compared to infectors aged 19-44
years, children were less infectious even after controlling for other factors including symptomatic status
(aRR=0.21 [0.07-0.66] for 0-5 years and 0.47 [0.32-0.68] for 6-18 years). Adults aged ≥45 years seemed
to be more infectious, but this association disappeared when controlling for increased symptomaticity of
older adults. Male infectors were found to be less infectious than females (aRR 0.78 [0.66-0.92]). Infectors
who had a delay from symptom onset to confirmation of ≥4 days were associated with higher
infectiousness (aRR=3.01 [2.11-4.31]). Local cases with unknown origin had the highest infectivity of the
four categories by origin, with R of 1.04 (0.87-1.25) and SAR of 8.5% (7.7 - 9.4). Cases identified through
symptomatic surveillance had the highest SAR of any subgroup (14% and 9.8% for ILI and SARI
respectively).
Serial Interval
After excluding asymptomatic cases, 54 infector-infectee pairs were identified where symptom onset
dates for both infector and infectee were available. 35, 14 and 5 pairs were from March, April and May
respectively. One pair was dropped for having a large negative serial interval (-19 days). Estimated
parameters for the serial interval distribution are shown in table S3 and the fit is shown in figures 3E,F
and S3. When analysing the 53 pairs, Weibull distribution was the best fit (AIC=-291) with a mean of 5.4
(4.4-6.4) and SD of 4.3 (3.0-5.1) days. When analysing serial intervals with positive values only (51 pairs),
the Weibull distribution was again the best fit (AIC=-249) with a mean of 5.9 (5.0-6.9) and SD of 3.3 (2.44.1) days.

symptomatic given SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4). The probability of symptomatic infection increased
with age. When compared to cases aged 19-44 years old, children were about half as likely to be
symptomatic (aRR=0.46 [0.19-1.11] for 0-5 years and 0.39 [0.24-0.64] for 6-18 years); whereas older
adults aged 45-64 years were about twice as likely to be symptomatic (aRR=2.24 [1.77- 2.84]), and
elderly aged ≥65 years were about four times as likely to be symptomatic (aRR=4.46 [3.37- 5.90]). Males
were 1.29 (1.04-1.62) times more likely to be symptomatic than females. A secondary case was 8.16
(3.29-20.24) times more likely to be symptomatic if the index case was also symptomatic compared to if
it was asymptomatic. Presence of one or more comorbidities was associated with increased
symptomaticity but was not statistically significant (aRR=1.13 [0.92- 1.39]).

imported domestic cases (0.46%), and imported international cases (0.15%). In surveillance case

categories, SARI cases had a much higher CFR (23.66%) than ILI (2.42%). CFR steadily increased with
age in both sexes, ranging from 0.07% in 0-9 years old to 16.31% in males and 17.55% in females of age
80 and above (Figure 4). The highest CFR was recorded for cases that were reported in the month of April
(5.39%).

Discussion
Although the reproduction number R0 of the novel coronavirus has been well characterised, we find that
R0 alone fails to capture the true picture of individual-level transmission dynamics. Overdispersion (k)
ranged from 0.04 to 0.34 in our study, confirming that there is significant heterogeneity in transmission
of the novel coronavirus. Importantly, we did not find significant underlying heterogeneity in the number
of contacts. Figure 3C shows clustering in the number of secondary cases (concave line) while the number
of contacts are homogenous as indicated by a relatively linear relation. Heterogeneity in transmission
can be explained by heterogeneity in the number of contacts and/or the probability of infection per
contact (infectivity level of index case and nature of exposure).(28,29) Modelling studies indicate that
SARS-CoV-2 SSEs occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a
high concurrent number of exposed contacts. (30) Since the patients which caused a majority of
secondary cases did not have a concurrent larger share of total contacts (8.7% of infectious cases had
14.4% of contacts but caused 80% of transmission), our findings underscore the importance of the high
infectivity of index case (at the time of exposure) and the nature of exposure in causing a successful SSE.
The most reliable estimates of overdispersion (k) in our study were 0.12 (0.11-0.15) for confirmed traced
cases (n=956) and 0.22 (0.17-0.27) from the three clusters (n=394). Our estimates of k align with the
lower range of current global estimates, albeit with smaller confidence intervals due to larger sample

size. A modelling study analysing global clusters estimated k at 0.10 (0.05-0.20). (31) A study of 1288
cases estimated k at 0.06 (0.05-0.07) and 0.20 (0.09-0.31) in two states of Indonesia. (32) In China, k was
estimated at 0.25 (0.13–0.88) from 135 cases in Tianjin (33) and at 0·58 (0·35–1·18) from 391 cases in
Shenzhen. (34) In Hong Kong, k was estimated at 0.43 (0.29–0.67) from 290 cases. (23) In Georgia USA,
the overall k ranged from 0.32 to 0.49, with even lower values after shelter-in-place orders were issued.
(35) Our findings suggest that super-spreading played a more dominant role in transmission in
Karnataka, India, as compared to most high-income countries. Interestingly, phylogenetic studies
indicate that remote clusters can be retrospectively linked to a previous SSE, indicating that superspreading may play an even larger role in the overall propagation of the epidemic than is detected
through surveillance and tracing. (36) Ideally then, the true picture of epidemics can only be understood
by analysing contact tracing, serological and phylogenetic data together, which can help plan adequate
control measures.
Modelling studies indicate that the delay from symptom onset to confirmation (testing delay) is an
essential determinant of the effectiveness of contact tracing. (5,37) Indeed, we found that infectors
diagnosed four or more days after symptom onset led to a higher SAR among their contacts (9.6% vs
3.8%) and also had a higher number of contacts (median 15 vs 10.5). We found that this delay was lower
for cases who had an early first contact with surveillance or contact tracing systems, namely, cases
screened at entry ports (imported cases) and local cases from known contact lists. Imported cases had a
low reproduction number compared to local cases (Table S2) which suggests that screening and
registration of all persons at entry ports leading to early detection of these cases prevented most onward
transmission. Cases captured through symptom-based surveillance and those whose source of infection
was unknown had a higher SAR than all other case categories (Table 2) and had a concurrently higher
testing delay (table S4). SARI had lower infectiousness than ILI cases which could be explained by their
hospitalisation preventing some transmission. Cases that were from known contact lists were confirmed
0.88 days (0.60-2.04) earlier and caused 60% less secondary infections than local cases whose origin was
unknown (R 1.04 vs 0.42). These findings highlight the effect of contact tracing in reducing transmission
and reassert the importance of minimising testing and tracing delays.
We estimated the relative risk (aRR) of infectivity at 3.63 (3.04- 4.34) for symptomatic infectors as
compared to asymptomatic carriers (SAR 7.7 vs 2.0%; R 2.04 vs 0.41) (table 2 and S2). Other studies have
found that infectiousness also increases with disease severity. (38) This suggests that predictors of
symptomatic infection and/or severe disease (like age) are by extension also predictors of increased
infectiousness (Table 4). Accordingly, interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small
impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as suggested by their low symptomaticity and severity and
thus lower infectiousness than adults. (39) Our study also finds that children aged 6-18 are less infectious
even after adjusting for lower symptomatic infections in this group. Interestingly, we found a strong
association between the symptom status of the index and secondary case; symptomatic infectors were
8.16 (3.29-20.24) times more likely to generate symptomatic secondaries. These findings are
corroborated by He D et al., who estimated relative risk of infectivity of symptomatics against that of
asymptomatics at 3.9 (1.5–11.8), and at 6.6 (2.0–34.7) when focusing on symptomatic secondaries. (40)
With symptomatic infectors both, more likely to produce secondary cases in general and also more likely

to produce symptomatic secondaries who are themselves more infectious, it seems that a cascading effect
of high transmission potential may play a role in amplifying COVID-19 outbreaks. Though it is known that
nasopharyngeal viral load is higher in symptomatic cases and increases with severity in COVID-19, (41)
it would be pertinent to explore whether a higher infectious dose from the infector influences symptom
status and infection severity in the secondary case, something that could explain findings from this and
He D et al. (40,42)
We found one study estimating the serial interval of SARS-CoV-2 from contact tracing data in India;
however, this study assumed the date of sample collection in asymptomatic cases as a proxy for symptom
onset which heavily affects the reliability of their estimate. (43) Although we present reliable estimates
of serial interval for COVID-19 for the first time from India, enhanced data sharing enabling real-time
estimation to inform policy decisions is recommended to account for the temporal variation of serial
interval as observed in China. (44) Given that the reproduction number is sensitive to the value of serial
interval used for its estimation, it is prudent to select the serial interval distribution that fits best in
context of the location and time phase of the epidemic. (45) Our estimated mean serial interval of 5.4
(4.4-6.4) agrees with existing evidence from global studies. (10)
Our study has certain limitations. Firstly, symptomatic status was based on data collected at the time of
sample collection and hence some cases recorded as asymptomatic may have developed symptoms later.
(46–48) This would overestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections and also the relative
transmissibility by asymptomatics since presymptomatic cases have been shown to be more infectious
than asymptomatic carriers. (40,47,49) Second, any amount of case and/or contact under-ascertainment
during surveillance and contact tracing carries the potential to bias our results. Although we have
attempted to minimise this bias by analysing subgroups with high reliability of data (Table S2), some
degree of bias can still be expected. Since the completeness of contact tracing is inherently limited by
memory recall and logistics, R estimated from contact tracing data cannot capture the entirety of the
outbreak and can thus be expected to underestimate the true R. Third, details of settings of transmission
and timing of exposure of contact to index case were not available for the vast majority of cases which
precluded any insightful analysis on the same. Finally, the dates of symptom onset in our study may be
subject to recall bias. Additionally, our results should be interpreted in the context of the NPIs in place at
the time of the study. From 25 March to 8 June, physical distancing was mandated in Karnataka with
closures of schools and most public places, restrictions on large gatherings, and mask wearing in public
settings.
Our findings have a few important implications for optimizing policy. We find that even though
surveillance, tracing, and social distancing may keep the reproduction number and hence transmission
at low levels, super spreading is common in COVID-19 and carries the potential to acutely overwhelm
surveillance and tracing systems. However, this presents an opportunity as well, in that outbreaks where
a minority of cases cause most further transmission (high dispersion, low k) are much more amenable to
control through measures that target the high-risk groups and settings responsible for most of the
transmission. (6–8) Existing measures that limit potential super-spreading including bans on large
gatherings and capping capacity in closed spaces are expected to remain beneficial. (28) Specifically,

18

emphasis should be given on backward or retrospective contact tracing which becomes increasingly
effective as overdispersion increases, and tracing and testing delays should be minimized. (31,37)
Evidence on the effect of symptom status on transmission suggests that measures targeted at children
will not reduce transmission significantly. (39,49) Although more studies are needed, there is increasing
evidence that symptomatic cases beget more symptomatic secondaries and may cause a snowballing
effect on transmission across generations, (40) which has significant implications for both- transmission
and morbidity control in COVID-19 outbreaks.

Supplementary Materials
S1. Definition of high risk and low risk contact 1
High-risk contact:
● Lives in the same household as the case
● Anyone in close proximity (within 1 meter) of the confirmed case without
precautions
● Touched or cleaned the linens, clothes, or dishes of the patient.
● Had direct physical contact with the body of the patient including physical
examination without PPE.
● Passenger in close proximity (within 1 meter) of a conveyance with a symptomatic
person who later tested positive for COVID-19.
● Touched body fluids of the case without appropriate PPE (respiratory tract
secretions, blood, vomit, saliva, urine, feces)
Low-risk contact:
● Any contact not fitting into the above high-risk contact description.

S2. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling for estimating reproduction
number and overdispersion from contact tracing data
We implemented a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method using the
NUTS sampler in PyStan 2.18.0.0 with gamma prior estimates of R and k with mean 2.5
SD 2.0, and mean 0.45 SD 0.1 respectively based on previous studies. 2–5 8 chains were
parallelly simulated for 5000 iterations and were checked for convergence of Rhat to 1.
The first 500 iterations for all chains were discarded as a burn-in period.

S3. Determinants of risk of infection among contacts
We fit a Poisson regression model with robust error variance to data on contacts’
recorded infection status (binary outcome: contact infected OR not infected) and
attributes of each contact's index cases to estimate adjusted relative risks for infection
of contacts as a function of these exposures.6 For a subset of this data that included
only symptomatic index cases and their contacts, we fit another model which also
included the delay from symptom onset to confirmation of the index case (a proxy for
delay in case isolation and increasing infectious period spent in community) as a
predictor variable. Only high-risk/close contacts were included because the recording of
‘low-risk contact’ status was not deemed reliable in the accessed dataset.

S4. Determinants of presence of clinical symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection
We fit a Poisson regression model with robust error variance to data on confirmed
COVID-19 cases’ symptom status (binary outcome: case is symptomatic OR
asymptomatic) and attributes of each case and their index case (where known) to
estimate adjusted relative risks for developing symptoms in a COVID-19 case as a
function of these exposures.6

S5. Minimizing bias due to incomplete contact tracing
The accuracy of reproduction number (R) and overdispersion (k) estimates from data
depends on the completeness and adequacy of the contact tracing efforts during the
sampled time. For example, cases with zero linked secondary cases in the dataset
could either be due to no further transmission from the case after adequate tracing, or
due to inadequate or absent contact tracing of the case leading to failure of identification
of secondary cases. To account for the possible bias arising out of inadequate contact
tracing specially at later stages of the study, we estimated R and k for multiple time
periods, and for cases from each category and from major clusters separately.
Three cut-off dates are evaluated in table S2 and figure S2, with the following rationale.
● 1 June was the last date for which the detailed IDSP dataset was available (refer
to “Data sources” under Methods section).
● As the epidemic progressed, contact tracing systems were stretched leading to
inadequate identification or follow-up of contacts of some cases. We assumed that
prevailing contact tracing was adequate if the origin of at least 80% of daily cases
was known.7,8 This threshold was breached consistently (for more than seven days
in a row) after 13 June. This became our second cut-off date for R and k analysis
(to minimize bias due to inadequate tracing after this date).
● 21 July was the last date for which the state government bulletins were available
with individual case details (refer to “Data sources” under Methods section).

S6. Additional details on surveillance and tracing methods utilized by the state of
Karnataka, India
Karnataka utilised a technology backed multi-sectoral approach to contact tracing with
collaboration between health department and law enforcement personnel to effectively
trace and track cases. Innovations in quarantine enforcement included a Quarantine
Watch mobile app and community based Mobile Squads to monitor contacts in
quarantine. It was made mandatory for all returnees and travellers coming to Karnataka
to register on a web portal, which enabled comprehensive screening at all entry points
and adequate follow up after entry. Additionally, the state carried out a physical and

Estimates in bold are from subgroups where contact tracing was known or expected to be
comprehensive, and thus bias to be minimal.
* This data was available only for cases confirmed up to 1 June as part of the IDSP dataset.
** All cases linked to these three clusters were included irrespective of any last date of confirmation. Cases
and contacts linked to known clusters are more likely to be followed-up and tested than sporadic cases. As
such, estimates from these subgroups are expected to minimize bias when compared to those from the
entire dataset.
