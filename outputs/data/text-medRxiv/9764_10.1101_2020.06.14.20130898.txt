Abstract
During the first pandemic wave Covid-19 reached Latin America cities. Aim: To report
clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted
during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe
and critical cases. Methods: Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture
associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied.
Results: 21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between
epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8% of total regional cases. Hospitalization
occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients ≥60 years old predominated
(57.1%). Hypertension (61.9%), obesity (57.1%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1%) were
prevalent but 19% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved
second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid
serological testing were limited (19% at 1st week; 42.9% at 2nd week). Nine patients
(42.9%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation
due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly
associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required
urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission.
Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5%) and length of stay was ≥ 14 days in 57.9%
of patients. Conclusion: In our regional Center, Covid 19 was associated to known risk
factors, had a prolonged stay and in-hospital mortality. Tachypnea ≥30/min is predictive of
transfer to ICU.

Introduction

Covid-19 is an emerging disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and first reported in late
2019 in China (1). Due to its rapid expansion, on March 2020 it was declared a global
pandemic by the WHO (2) and up to date has affected more than 6 million habitants
worldwide of whom 379,941 have died (3). The first case reported in Chile was registered
on March 3rd and at the beginning of June 105,000 cases has been reported with more than
a thousand people deceased (4). The temporal evolution of this epidemic is unknown, but it
has been estimated that it could generate recurrent outbreaks and remain in circulation for a
long time (5). Currently there is little information on the clinical presentation of Covid-19
and outcomes in Latin America, especially in hospitalized patients (6-9). This could
contrast with that reported in countries of the northern hemisphere, which have dissimilar
features on demographic, economic, cultural, healthcare systems and/or mitigation
strategies issues (10-19). We present this preliminary report on a cohort of Covid-19
patients during the first wave in a southern region in Chile detailing clinical features and
outcomes in a reference center.

Patients and Methods

Study design, inclusion criteria and laboratory tests. Retrospective descriptive study of
patients admitted during the first wave at the Hospital Regional of Valdivia, in southern
Chile. Patients were included, if had suspicious symptoms plus either a positive SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR or a rapid serological test coupled with compatible chest-CT imaging. For
RT-PCR tests, nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained and placed in viral transport
medium. Total nucleic acids were extracted from 200 µL of transport medium with
Chemagic Prepito Instrument using Prepito Viral DNA / RNA Kit (Both PerkinElmer ™)
according to manufacturer’s recommendations and eluted in 100 µL of an elution buffer.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using the Primerdesign COVID-19 Genesig Real-Time
PCR assay and the amplification reaction was performed in a Bio-Rad® CFX96
thermocycler according to manufacturer's instructions. Specimens were considered positive
if the Ct value was <37 and the internal controls were detected. In parallel, the quality of

the samples was checked with a human RNAse P Real-Time PCR assay with the CDC
primers from IDT. Serology was performed using the “VivaDiag COVID  19 IgM / IgG
Rapid Test lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)” kit based on the addition of 10 µL of serum
and then 2 to 3 drops of (70-100 µL) buffer dilution. Results were read after 15 minutes.
Regional management protocol. Los Ríos Region has an estimated population of 406,000
inhabitants (20). Most of the population (> 80%) is cared for in an integrated network of
primary care centers and low-complexity hospitals, with only one high-complexity
reference center (Hospital Regional) designated to receive severe and critically ill Covid-19
patients. Severity illness stratification was performed based on a regional clinical care
guideline using the following classification: a) Mild: no need of oxygen therapy or
hospitalization, b) Moderate: low oxygen requirement (FiO2 <32%); PaO2 / FiO2 ratio ≥
200, respiratory rate <30/min, and no shock or organ dysfunction, c) Severe: FiO2 3240%; PaO2 / FiO2 ratio ≥ 200, respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, without shock or organ
dysfunction, and d) Critical: FiO2> 40%; PaO2 / FiO2 ratio <200, septic shock, organ
dysfunction, chest x-ray with bilateral infiltrates and / or requirement for invasive
mechanical ventilation (IMV). Patients in severe or critical conditions were transferred to
the Regional Hospital. The guideline considered the use of hydroxychloroquine (HQ; day
1: 400mg every 12hrs, day 2-5: 200mg every 12 hrs) in all admitted patients as well as
those > 60 years and / or with chronic diseases. All admitted patients received a beta-lactam
antibiotic and pharmacological prophylaxis for thromboembolic disease. Besides, critical
patients with a D-dimer (DD) value > 6 times the normal value were prescribed with an
intermediate heparin dose (unfractionated formulation 5,000 UI every 8 hours or
enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/day). The use of glucocorticoids and convalescent plasma were
indicated according to the criteria of physicians in charge.

Clinical characterization and outcomes. Demo-epidemiological variables, pregnancy status
and comorbidities as well as clinical features were retrieved from medical records. The
CALL score was calculated as described (21) as well SOFA and APACHE II in those

admitted to the ICU. Pharmacological therapies, complications, clinical outcomes, length of
stay and in-hospital mortality were extracted and calculated from medical records.

Statistical analysis and ethical issues. Data corresponding to quantitative variables is
presented as medians with interquartile range (IQR) and categorical variables as
percentages. Analysis of potential factors associated with ICU admission was performed
with non-parametric tests such as the Fisher or the Mann-Whitney test. Some graphs were
fitted with the least squares method to facilitate trends reading. This work was approved by
the Institutional Review Board.

Results

Cases identified and epidemiological features. Twenty-one patients were admitted to our
hospital between epidemiological weeks 13 and 20, a group that compose this preliminary
report. During this timeframe, hospital admissions at our center (all in severe or critical
condition) represented 8.8% of the total reported cases in the region (21 out of 237). Figure
1 shows the impact of the first wave on admissions at our reference center. Admissions (to
all units or ICU) decreased secondary to mitigation measures.
Clinical features. Median age was 61 years (range 26-85 years, IQR 51-68 years) and more

than half were ≥ 60 years old (Table 1). Female patients predominated and contact with a
known Covid-19 case was frequent. A healthcare worker integrates this report whose
contagion occurred in a primary care center. Hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes
mellitus were prevalent (Table 1). Two patients were pregnant and 19% had no comorbid
history. The use of active drugs on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system approached
40% of the series (Table 1). Predominant symptoms in order of frequency were cough,
dyspnea, and fever followed by myalgia, odynophagia, and headache. Anosmia and
dysgeusia were reported in about a quarter of patients. Diarrhea and rhinorrhea were
infrequent but observed in about a fifth of cases (Figure 2). Arterial hypotension on
admission was infrequent (9.5%). The median symptomatic period before admission was

11 days (IQR 5-13 days, Figure 1). About half of our patients were admitted with
tachypnea and an abnormal PaO2 / FiO2, but low O2 saturation on pulse oximetry or
hypoxemia in arterial gases was less frequent (Table 2). We did not observe patients with
leukocytosis or neutrophilia. In contrast, the fraction of patients with lymphopenia (42.9%)
and to a lesser degree, thrombocytopenia (23.8%) was relevant. The series also highlights
the high frequency of patients with elevated LDH and ferritin plasmatic values (> 70%,
Table 2). Coagulation parameters (International Normalized Ratio and activated partial
thromboplastin time) did not show major alterations, but DD values were elevated in about
half of patients.
Management, complications and outcome. Approximately 40% (9/21) of patients were
transferred to ICU (Table 3), all requiring IMV with median SOFA and APACHE II scores
of 4 points (range 2-9) and 12 points (range 3-20), respectively. Half of the patients had a
CALL score in the highest severity range (10-13 points, Table 3). The use of vasoactive
drugs was required in 8 of the 9 patients with IMV. All the patients received by protocol,
HQ and about half also azithromycin. Furthermore, 5 of the 21 patients received steroid
therapy (23.8%, Table 3). Corticosteroids were indicated in patients with refractory ARDS
(methyl prednisolone), refractory shock (hydrocortisone), obstructive bronchitis
(hydrocortisone), thrombocytopenic purpura (dexamentasone) and to achieve fetal
maturation (betamethasone) in a pregnant woman. In the latter case, she had a 28 weeks
pregnancy and underwent an urgent cesarean section, receiving the only convalescent
plasma therapy in the series shortly before delivery. She had a premature newborn
weighing 1540 grams, with hypotonia, intraventricular hemorrhage, seizures, neonatal
jaundice and later bacteremia, requiring IVM connection and application of pulmonary
surfactant. Perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was ruled out. Until the time of
publication, he was still hospitalized in the neonatal ICU.
Among observed complications, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was
recorded in 9 patients (42.9%), nosocomial infections in 33.3%, and Acute Kidney Injury in
28.6% (with dialysis requirement in one of them). An isolated prolonged QTc interval
event was registered but without arrhythmia (Table 3). Health care-associated infections

included 3 events of bloodstream infections, 2 of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 of
urinary tract infection, and one of fever without an identified source. Median hospital stay
was 18 days with more than half remaining hospitalized ≥ 2 weeks. Two of our patients
died (in-hospital mortality 9.5%) at 35 and 38 days after admission due to central venous
catheter-associated bloodstream infection and refractory ARDS, respectively.

Serological and molecular studies. All patients underwent a rapid serologic test to detect
IgM / IgG antibodies. After the first round (taken at different weeks of symptoms onset),
most showed IgM+/IgG + (81%) or isolated IgM+ (9.5%) antibodies (Table 4). Negative
and invalid results were also observed. A second round of examinations carried out in the 4
patients with negative, invalid or isolated positive IgM results, demonstrated
seroconversion to IgM+/IgG+ in all of them. Rapid test sensitivity during the first round
increased according to the elapsed time but was low during the first 3 weeks (19% to
61.9%, Table 4, Figure 3).

Comparison of critical versus non-critical group. An exploratory analysis was performed
to identify possible factors associated with a transfer to ICU. A critical evolution was not
associated with increased age, gender, comorbidities, pregnancy, or a higher CALL score
(data not shown). However, 2 factors appeared linked to ICU admission: tachypnea and
elevated plasma LDH values. Seven out of 9 patients with a critical condition had
tachypnea vs. 3 out of 12 without a critical condition (OR 10.5; IC95 1.36-81; p <0.05).
Plasmatic LDH values in the critical group had a median of 467 U/L (IQR 427-493) versus
267.5 U/L (IQR 238-305) in the non-critical group (p <0.05). Due to the small size of the
groups, a multivariate analysis was not attempted.

Discussion

After attacking China, Europe, and the United States, the epicenter of the Covid-19
pandemics is centered currently in Latin America. However, there is little information on
the clinical features, management, and outcome for this infection in our region. This work

contributes to the knowledge of this infection in the Latin American context and
communicates its preliminary results. Patients were managed using a protocol built
according to the best evidence available at the time of its preparation (22-25) and although
the pharmacological therapies initially contemplated are currently questioned or
disregarded (26-30), the existence of a guideline made it possible to work in a uniform
manner in a whole region of southern Chile.

As in other experiences, we were able to confirm that hospital admissions occur several
days after the onset of symptoms, that less than 10% of all cases require hospitalization and
that hospital stay is prolonged (10,17). Patient characteristics reflect the weight of
comorbidities and advanced age, involvement of healthcare personnel or pregnant women,
and known systemic and respiratory symptoms in addition to changes in taste or smell and
occasionally gastrointestinal manifestations. In our series, ICU admission for critical
conditions was very high (about 50% of admissions) because our center concentrates severe
and critical patients of the region. All patients received HQ per protocol, a drug whose
efficacy and safety has recently been questioned (26, 27, 31). In our series, only one case of
QTc prolongation was observed and none presented arrhythmias.

Steroid therapy was applied on a case-by-case basis for different reasons and not by
protocol, since there is no consensus regarding its use. Although the available evidence has
not been consistent (32, 33), some experiences have suggested that administration could
increase survival (34-36). Its use in turn, must be balanced with its known association with
infectious complications, myopathy, delirium, hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding or
hydro-electrolyte disorders (37). ARDS secondary to other viral etiologies have been
associated with a delayed viral clearence (38) or even increased mortality (33, 39).
Currently, some prospective projects are underway that could solve these questions.

There were 2 patients carrying a second trimester pregnancy who presented with
pneumonia and respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2, one of them with severe illness that
responded to conventional O2 therapy without fetal or maternal complications. The second

evolved in a critical condition, requiring IMV, and prompt fetal lung maturation with
corticosteroids. Fortunately her evolution was favorable after an urgent cesarean section
and convalescent plasma therapy. The impact of this infection in pregnancy is beginning to
be delineated with no intrauterine transmission events or maternal mortality so far reported
and with most of the deliveries managed by Cesarean sections (40). Fetal consequences
may include intrauterine growth retardation, cyanosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and
neonatal mortality (40).

Convalescent plasma is an experimental potentially beneficial therapy (41, 42) that has
shown an adequate safety profile (43). Recently, a randomized clinical trial reported a trend
towards a higher proportion of patients with clinical improvement (28 days) and lower
mortality in the plasma-receiving group (44).

Laboratory tests showed an inflammatory state (elevated C-reactive protein, ferritin and
plasmatic LDH levels) and procoagulant status (increased DD). The relevance of tachypnea
and elevated plasma LDH in the identification of critically ill patients was confirmed.
These results are consistent with other studies where increased LDH values had a high
sensitivity (100%) and specificity (86.7%) to predict severe disease (45). In our report, the
low number of cases prevented confirming other variables associated with severity or
adverse prognosis such as advanced age, high fever, chronic diseases (especially chronic
cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, diabetes and high blood pressure), coagulopathy,
increased D-dimer, troponin or ferritin levels, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, and/or
leukocytosis (34, 46-49).

Serology by a rapid antibody-based test was performed in all patients with 19% and 42.9%
sensitivity in the first and second week, respectively, consistent with other reports (50, 51)
that reinforce its limited utility for early diagnosis. However, it can be helpful when a high
suspicion exists despite serial negative RT-PCT and compatible symptoms and chest-CT
images as happened in one of our patients.

Complications observed underline the high frequency of ARDS and healthcare associated
infections which in turn explained death of our patients (52). Autopsy studies have revealed
the presence of diffuse alveolar damage, in exudative and proliferative phases, including
alterations such as capillary congestion, pneumocyte necrosis, hyaline membrane,
interstitial edema, atypical and hyperplastic pneumocytes, and microthrombi in arterioles
(53 , 54). The latter support using anticoagulants in patients with high DD (55) which in
observational studies has shown to reduce mortality (56, 57). Thus all our patients received
heparin prophylaxis and in one third we use high-intermediate doses due to high DD
values.

Conclusions

In our regional Center, Covid-19 was associated to known risk factors, had a prolonged stay
and in-hospital mortality. Near 8% of regional cases evolved with a severe or critical illness
and required to be transferred to a designated reference hospital. Tachypnea ≥30/min and
high plasmatic LDH levels were predictive of transfer to ICU, mainly by ARDS. Rapid
antibody-based tests were not useful for early diagnosis. Besides ARDS, hospital-acquired
infections and acute kidney injury were frequent complications. As specific therapeutic
alternatives have no proven effectiveness, Covid-19 management rest mainly on supportive
care.
