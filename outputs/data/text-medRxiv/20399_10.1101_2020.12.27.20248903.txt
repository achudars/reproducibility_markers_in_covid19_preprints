ABSTRACT

Background: Clinical investigations have argued for long-term neurological manifestations in both
hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether long-term neurological
symptoms and features depend on COVID-19 severity.

Methods: from a sample of 208 consecutive non-neurological patients hospitalized for COVID-19
disease, 165 survivors were re-assessed at 6 months according to a structured standardized clinical
protocol. Prevalence and predictors of long-term neurological manifestations were evaluated using
multivariate logistic regression analyses.

Results At 6-month follow-up after hospitalisation due to COVID-19 disease, patients displayed a
wide array of symptoms; fatigue (34%), memory/attention (31%), and sleep disorders (30%) were
the most frequent. At neurological examination, 40% of patients exhibited neurological
abnormalities, such as hyposmia (18.0%), cognitive deficits (17.5%), postural tremor (13.8%) and
subtle motor/sensory deficits (7.6%). Older age, premorbid comorbidities and severity of COVID19 were independent predictors of neurological manifestations in logistic regression analyses.

Conclusions: premorbid vulnerability and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection impact on prevalence
and severity of long-term neurological manifestations.

INTRODUCTION
After the first cases of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan,
China, in December 2019, the spread rapidly in Europe became a pandemic, involving millions of
cases worldwide1. With the increasing number of confirmed cases and the accumulating clinical
data, it is now well established that, in addition to the predominant respiratory symptoms, a
significant proportion of COVID-19 patients experience neurological symptoms and syndromes 2-5.
Clinical findings on previously hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients with COVID- 19 reported
the persistence of multiple symptoms, particularly fatigue, dyspnoea, sleep disturbances and
memory complaints6-8. Accordingly, some authors have suggested the so called, but not yet defined,
“post-COVID-19 syndrome” based on persistent symptoms reported after resolution of SARS-CoV2 infection8. To date, however, the prevalence and severity of neurological long-term manifestations
and the correlation with severity of COVID-19 infection are still under debate, as no long-term data
using extensive neurological assessment are still available yet in the growing literature.
In this study, subjects previously hospitalised for COVID-19 disease entered a longitudinal study in
order to evaluate general and neurological manifestations after 6 months of follow-up and their
potential relationship with pre-morbid conditions and severity of respiratory infection.

METHODS
All patients who survived COVID-19 disease and were discharged between February and April
2020 from a COVID-19 Unit of the ASST Spedali Civili Brescia Hospital were asked to participate
to a follow-up study. This includes a standardised evaluation of medical history, self-reported
5

neurological symptoms and a complete neurological examination at 6 months. Premorbid
conditions were recorded at admission using the Cumulative Illness rating scale9 (CIRS). Patients
with premorbid neurological conditions (including dementia) were excluded. Hospitalisation data
included the severity of COVID-19 disease, classified according to the Brescia-COVID Respiratory
Severity Scale (BCRSS), stratifying patients into mild, moderate and severe10 and the quick
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score11.
At follow-up, data were collected using a checklist of neurological symptoms related to central,
peripheral, myopathic and cognitive manifestations, whereas the neurological examination assessed
cranial nerves, motor (global and focal), sensory, cerebellar, basal ganglia-related function, deep
tendon reflexes, pyramidal signs. Global cognitive function was carried out by using the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) by Italian validated norms12.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee of ASST “Spedali Civili di Brescia” Hospital
and the requirement for informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission (NP 4166).

Statistical analysis
Differences between patients according to COVID-19 respiratory severity (BCRSS) and the
association with neurological complaints were evaluated by Fisher’s exact test or ANOVA with
Bonferroni correction for dichotomic and continuous variables, respectively. To explore the risk
factors associated with neurological symptoms and neurological features, univariable and
multivariable logistic regression models were implemented, including the following predictors: age,
sex, premorbid CIRS, days of hospitalisation and COVID-19 severity.
The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon
reasonable request.

RESULTS

6

From a sample of 208 consecutively hospitalized patients for COVID-19 disease, 33 deceased
during hospitalisation. Survivors were younger (p=0.001; 65.7+12.6 vs 78.6+8.6) and exhibited less
comorbidities (p=0.004, mean CIRS 1.36+0.51 vs 1.51+0.4) and lower COVID-19 severity
(p=0.001, mean BCRSS 0.90+0.85 vs 2.89 + 0.32) compared to deceased patients.
Out of 175 survivors, five patients died after discharge, three had a previous diagnosis of dementia
and two refused to participate, resulting in a final sample of 165 patients (supplementary Figure 1).
Patients stratified according to COVID-19 severity (BCRSS) differ for number of days of
hospitalisation, O2 treatment and qSOFA but not for age or premorbid CIRS (Table 1).
At follow-up, no patients reported new hospitalisations or new-onset of medical conditions. The
most common symptoms reported were fatigue (34%), memory complaints (31%), sleep disorders
(30.8%) and myalgias (29.6%), followed by depression/anxiety, visual disturbances, paraesthesia
and hyposmia (Figure 1, supplementary Table 1). Patients with moderate/severe COVID-19
reported higher number of symptoms at follow-up (p=0.004) after correction for age and premorbid
CIRS. In univariable analyses, moderate/severe COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of
memory complaints (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.18- 5.8), loss of dependency in IADL (OR 2.6, 95% CI
1.12-6.2), confusion (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.12-7.8), fatigue (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.95-4.6), and visual
disturbances (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.5-8.4) at 6-months of follow-up compared to mild disease.
Multivariable analyses identified premorbid comorbidities (p=0.006), age at admission (p=0.048)
and severity of COVID-19 (p=0.04) as predictors of total number of symptoms reported.
One-hundred and five patients (63,6%) were further evaluated using a standard neurological
examination and cognitive screening. This group of patients were comparable to patients evaluated
via telemedicine for age, sex distribution, pre-morbid CIRS, severity of COVID-19 and reported
neurological symptom. At standard examination, 42/105 (40%) exhibited neurological
abnormalities, including subjective dysgeusia/hyposmia (n=19), enhanced physiological tremor
(n=15) and cognitive impairment (n=17). Ten patients exhibited low-limb reduced deep tendon
reflexes, two of them exhibited isolated feet hypoesthesia and two reached a diagnosis of sensor7

motor polyneuropathy with distal mild sensory and motor deficits (bilateral deficits within the
extension of feet 4/5 MRC). No alterations within cranial nerves, cerebellar function or pyramidal
signs were detected.
Neurological abnormalities at examination were associated with older age (p=0.005), higher
number of premorbid comorbidities (p=0.001), higher COVID-19 severity (p=0.05), longer
hospitalisation (p=0.002) and higher number of neurological symptoms reported (p=0.007). Logistic
regression identified duration of hospitalisation (p=0.02) and premorbid comorbidities(p=0.03) as
the best predictors of neurological abnormalities at examination.

DISCUSSION
Findings showed that previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients reported a wide array of
neurological symptoms six months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, predicted by combination of age,
premorbid conditions and severity of disease.
These data extend recent studies which have argued for a high prevalence of post-COVID clinical
manifestations and claimed that long-term consequences of COVID-19 involve both central and
peripheral nervous systems6-8,13,14.
In the present cohort of patients with six months of follow-up and extensive neurological
evaluation, the most prevalent symptoms reported were fatigue, memory complaints, sleep
disorders and myalgias followed by depression/anxiety, visual disturbances, paraesthesia and
hyposmia. These findings extended the earlier works of Carfi7 and Goertz8, reporting a high
persistence of respiratory symptoms and fatigue in more than half of hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients three months after COVID-19 infection. In our study, long-term neurological
complaints showed different distributions according to COVID-19 severity, which was associated
with increased total number of symptoms, fatigue, memory complaints and confusion. The impact
of SARS-CoV-2 severity in long-term persistent respiratory symptoms and fatigue has been
recently highlighted by a large survey 6 months after discharge in Wuhan6. Our study, conducted in
8

smaller but more homogeneous older population consecutively enrolled in a single COVID-19 unit,
suggest that even small differences in the severity of infection can impact on long-term neurological
manifestations. This effect was prominent for cognitive symptoms, including memory complaints
and attention deficits- whereas other symptoms- - such as myalgias or numbness - appeared to be
independent from severity. This might suggest a higher vulnerability of central nervous system to
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection possibly through higher general inflammatory response and longer
hospitalisation- as already highlighted for other infectious disease16. We found age and premorbid
comorbidities as important independent predictors of long-term symptoms, at variance with the data
reported by Huang and coauthors for respiratory symptoms and fatigue6. These findings are of
particular interest, as we excluded patients with premorbid dementia or other known neurological
conditions or patients with neurologic COVID-19 presentation5, focusing on neurological features
in patients with prominent respiratory COVID-19 disease16.
At standardised neurological examination, 40% of subjects exhibited mild abnormalities -not
reported before the hospitalisation for COVID-19 disease. The most prevalent features were
hyposmia, cognitive impairment, enhanced physiological tremor and subtle motor and sensory lowlimb deficits in several cases. Age, premorbid comorbidities and longer hospitalization were, again,
the strongest predictors of neurological abnormalities at examination. This would suggest that
SARS-CoV-2 infection has probably a stronger long-term neurological impact in older subjects
with higher vulnerability who suffered an acute respiratory syndrome. The complex interaction
between physical and brain resilience and long-term disability after hospitalization has been indeed
already demonstrated for other infectious diseases, such as community-acquired pneumonia16. In
fact, we need to acknowledge that the experience of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection in
frail elderly should is an important confounding factor-as it can influence the relationship between
long-term manifestations and psychosocial long-term disturbances 17-19.
Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, pre-morbid conditions were based on medical
records and assessment during hospitalisation thus not allowing a complete premorbid neurological
9

screening. Second, we excluded from the study patients with neurological disorders before or
concomitant the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus potentially underestimate the global
neurological burden due to COVID-19. Furthermore, this is a single-centre study conducted in an
homogeneous cohort of patients with moderate severity of COVID-19 and large studies including
intubated and non-hospitalized patients are warranted to confirm these findings.
Limitations notwithstanding, our findings indicate that several neurological features are a relevant
component of long-term manifestations of COVID-19 disease especially in more vulnerable and
severe patients, thus underlying the clinical need for longitudinal programs able to track the real
impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on long-term brain health status18-21,.
