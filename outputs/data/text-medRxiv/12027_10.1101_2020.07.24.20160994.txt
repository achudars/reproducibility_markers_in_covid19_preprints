Travel restrictions are the current central strategy to globally stop the transmission of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Despite remarkably successful approaches in predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of the ongoing
pandemic, we lack an intrinsic understanding of the travel restriction’s effectiveness. We fill this gap by developing a surprisingly simple measure, country
distancing, that is analogical to the effective resistance in series and parallel
circuits and captures the propagation backbone tree from the outbreak locations globally. This approach enables us to map the effectiveness of travel
restrictions to arrival time delay (ATD) or infected case reduction (ICR) systematically. Our method estimates that 50.8% of travel restrictions as of Apr-4
are ineffective, resulting in zero ATD or ICR worldwide. Instead, by imposing Hubei’s lockdown on Jan-23 and national lockdown on Feb-8, mainland

China alone leads to 11.66 [95% credible interval (CI), 9.71 to 13.92] days of
ATD per geographic area and 1,012,233 (95% CI, 208,210 -4,959,094) ICR in
total as of Apr-4. Our result unveils the trade-off between the country distancing increase and economic loss, offering practical guidance for strategic action
about when and where to implement travel restrictions, tailed to the real-time
national context.
The COVID-19 with 8,860,331 confirmed cases and 465,740 deaths worldwide, as of June
22, 2020, was first reported to the WHO (World Health Organization) on December 31, 2019 (1,
2). Today’s high population density (3) and high volume, speed, and nonlocality of human
mobility provide perfect conditions for epidemic spreading (4, 5), and simultaneously raise the
challenges for non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies on the time scale at the pace modern
diseases can spread (6, 7). Specifically, through the global mobility network (GMN), mainland
China introduces 288 infected cases to other geographic areas from January 3 to February 13,
2020 (8, 9). As COVID-19 is declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, more than half of
the world was infected, and geographic areas that are continuously exposed to massive airline
transits from different infected countries are currently in high importation risk (7). For example,
the virus in the US is mainly imported from European countries, including France, Austria, and
the Netherlands (10, 11), which is experiencing an upper infection with 2,241,178 confirmed
cases and 119,453 deaths till June 22, 2020.
Although the practice of quarantine and social distancing protocols can drastically reduce its
propagation locally (12), the global pandemic patterns of COVID-19 are shaped by the GMN,
which determines when and where the disease arrives globally (13). Consequently, the straightforward way for lowering the international importation of COVID-19 is to impose radical travel
restrictions (i.e., entry ban, global travel ban, and lockdown) (14,15) to shrink the entry of airline
passengers. As of April 4, 2020, 187 geographic areas imposed the entry ban, 87 geographic

areas imposed the global travel ban, and 70 geographic areas imposed the lockdown to prevent
their citizens and tourists from traveling overseas (16, 17). However, researchers demonstrated
that these travel restrictions are only effective at the beginning of an outbreak (18). Moreover,
they would interrupt the healthcare aid and technical support, disrupt businesses, and cause extensive and profound social and economic damage (19,20). Therefore, it is crucial to assess and
impose effective travel restrictions to avoid uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19,
which may lead to a substantial unnecessary cost.
Measuring the travel restrictions’ effectiveness often relies on the specific epidemic models (21,22), which require accurate estimation of the disease’s epidemiological parameters, such
as the basic reproductive number (R0). In spite of that, the parameter estimations are often not
reliable due to the daily changing under-reported cases and various errors due to insufficient
diagnosis tests (6, 23, 24). Furthermore, these models are hard to calibrate due to incomplete
information (i.e., partial network topology (25) or unknown dynamics (14, 26)), and it is unclear how much details are required to achieve a certain level of predictive accuracy. Human
mobility plays a crucial role in understanding the hidden spatiotemporal spreading patterns and
enables us to predict the arrival time (13) and estimate the number of infected cases (27) without
knowing the epidemiological parameters. It is remarkable that despite the complex topology of
the mobility network, a dominant trajectory defined as the effective distance (13) can always
be identified from the outbreak location (OL) to the target geographic area by discarding other
redundant connections. This method reliably predicts the arrival time and epidemic wavefront
without knowing the epidemiological parameters, which has already been demonstrated in both
the pandemic H1N1 and the global 2003 SARS epidemic. On the other hand, the aggregate
mobility outflow from the OL has also been a vital predictor for the cumulative number of infections in the destination location (27), validated by the Wuhan’s outflow to each prefecture
in mainland China. Despite advances of both approaches and their follow-up methods (7, 28),

they are more suitable for the early stage of the pandemic of COVID-19 than the late stage
when multiple OLs arise, increasing the level of complexity that promotes the needs of new
mathematical tools.

Global Disease Transmission Law and Country Distancing.

We test the international spread-

ing of the COVID-19 on the global mobility network (GMN) G = (N, E, F ) (See Methods,
Tab. S1 and Tab. S2) provided by the Official Aviation Guide (29), where N denotes geographic area set, E denotes the airline link set, and Fmn (Fmn ∈ F ) represents a weighted value
describing the airline passenger influx from area n to the area m. To eliminate the effect of
geographic areas’ sizes, we define Pmn =

PFmn
k Fkm

as the fraction of individuals that leave n and

go to m. For a complex GMN with a single OL, the diseases may propagate to the destination
through different paths. But the arrival time only depends on the shortest path whose length is
defined as the effective distance (13), since arrival time equals the effective distance divided by
the effective spreading velocity veff . The effective distance from n to a connected node m is
defined as dm|n = 1 − log Pmn , derived from the likelihood of transmitting the disease from n
to m, that is Pmn (Pmn = e1−dm|n ). For an arbitrary node that can be reached by n through a
path τ = {n, ..., i, j, ..., m}, the effective distance is the sum of effective lengths along the links
P
of the shortest path, dm|n = min (i,j)∈τ (1 − logPij ). Thus, we obtain the series law for global
τ

disease transmission:
edm|n = e

P

(i,j)∈τ

dj|i

(1)

We call this series law because it is analogical to the effective resistance in series circuits defined
P
as R =
i Ri , where Ri is the resistance that is connected along a chain. Take the series
connection of resistance as an example in Fig. 1A. The effective distance from n to m in GMN
satisfies edm|n = edc|n +dm|c , that is, dm|n = dc|n + dm|c , where c is on the shortest path between
m and n, which is analogical to R = Rn + Rc .

Next, we develop the parallel law for global disease transmission when multiple OLs present.
For example, the disease propagates from OLs, n and c, to the destination geographic area, m,
with effective distances dm|n , and dm|c respectively, as shown in Fig. 1A. Therefore, the likelihoods of transmitting disease from n and c are edm|n and edm|c respectively. Thus, the overall
likelihood of transmitting from both OLs satisfies

(See methods and

. For the general case, we derive the parallel law for global disease transmission

and formulate the country distancing of area m from the set of OLs NI as (see supplementary
text)
Dm|NI = log P

(2)

where NI = {i|∀i ∈ N &Ii > Ic } is the outbreak location set at time t. Here, we set Ic = 100,
as it is observed that the confirmed cases of COVID-19 raise exponentially after the 100th case
is confirmed (30). Ii is the accumulative confirmed infected cases at area i and |NI | ≤ M . See
supplementary text [Eqs. (S3)-(S12)] for the details about Eq. (2). Note that a large set of OLs
NI may lead to a small distance Dm|NI , because the more OLs, the higher probability to arrive
at geographic area, m. Our series and parallel law for global disease transmission enable us to
map any complex GMN to a star-like network, capturing the propagation backbone tree from
the outbreak locations globally, such as the shortest path tree ΨOLs depicted in Fig1. A.
Two fundamental properties – the arrival time (Tm ) and the infected cases (Im ) in arbitrary
geographic area m – describe the major spread patterns of the pandemic of COVID-19. Increasing findings show the strong correlation between human mobility and arrival times (7, 13, 28)
for the propagation of H1N1 and SARS, and the strong correlation between mobility flows from
Wuhan, mainland China and infected cases in other cities in mainland China (27) for the propagation of COVID-19. Therefore, human mobility determines both fundamental properties of the
spreading patterns, although they are established in the presence of a single OL. Motivated by

these independent but correlated researches together with our series and parallel law for global
disease transmission, we surprisingly find that country distancing generates linear relationships
with the arrival times Dm|NI ∝ Tm , and the logarithm of the infected cases Dm|NI ∝ log(Im ),
as shown in Fig. 1B-E and Fig. S1:
Tm = vNI × Dm|NI + v0NI

(3)

log(Im ) = uNI × Dm|NI + u0NI

(4)

where vNI and uNI are the slopes, respectively, representing the rates of change of arrival
times/infected cases relative to country distancing.
We simulate the spread of COVID-19 by adopting the meta-population susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) model (31) with the given epidemiological parameters of COVID-19 (32). As
shown in Fig. 1B and C, when mainland China is the only OL, i.e., NI = {mainland China},
we observe a strong correlation between country distancing and arrival times with R2 = 0.90
and vNI = 5.29 (95% CI, 4.52 to 6.01), indicating a 5.29 days delay of arrival time at area m
for an increase of 1 in Dm|NI due to travel restrictions. For the correlation between country
distancing and infected cases, R2 = 0.91 and vNI = −2.81 (95% CI, -3.23 to -2.38). It means
that 94% (1 − e2.81 ) of infected cases are reduced at area m for an increase of Dm|NI due to
travel restrictions. Furthermore, when NI = {mainland China, Japan} as shown in Fig. 1D
and E, R2 = 0.90 and slope vNI = 5.29 (95% CI, 4.53 to 6.01) for the correlation between
country distancing and arrival times and R2 = 0.91 and slope vNI = −2.81 (95% CI, -3.26
to -2.40) for the correlation between country distancing and infected cases. For the evolving
OL set according to the COVID-19 time-series data provided by Johns Hopkins University
and Ding Xiang Doctor Website (see Methods), we also systematically test the sensitivity of
the analysis (Fig. S3). By using the country distancing, we could give the generic spreading
speed v̄ [v̄=5.50(95% CI, 4.58-6.41)], and generic spreading rate, ū, [ū=-2.95 (95% CI,-3.51 to

-2.38)], for the different set of OLs [see (Fig. S3)]. Consequently, we can translate the changes
of country distancing to the arrival time delay (ATD) and infected case reduction (ICR) with
Eqs. (15) and (16).
Status Quo of Travel Restrictions.

Available Dataset reveals that 249 geographic areas im-

plement a total of 663 travel restrictions as of Apr-4. A total number of 476 entry bans imposed
by 184 countries (73.8%) from Jan-21 to March-17. These areas which imposed entry bans
deny access to non-citizens who have been at some specific geographical regions such as mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Schengen Area. At the early stage from Jan-21 to Feb-6,
49 areas (19.6%) imposed entry bans to distance themselves from the initially infected area,
namely, mainland China. As the COVID-19 continued spreading outside of mainland China,
most areas extended their entry bans to South Korea (42%), Japan (64%), Iran (4%), and Schengen Area (5.6%) from Feb-8 to Mar-13. Knowing that mainland China imposed lockdown at
Hubei Province (Jan-23) and national lockdown (Feb-8) to distance itself from the world, few
areas imposed an entry ban to mainland China since Feb-8. From Mar-11, when about half
of the countries were infected, worldwide, entry bans were not sufficient to lower the risk of
coronavirus importation from the infected regions. Consequently, 87 areas (34.9%) imposed
the global travel ban to prevent oversea travels from entering their areas except for their residents, and 65 countries (26.1%) imposed the partial lockdowns and 12 (4.8%) countries imposed
full/national lockdowns to prevent people entering and exiting their countries (see Fig. 2A-B
and Tab. S3).
Effectiveness of Travel Restrictions.

The existing travel restrictions that are imposed to curb

the spread of COVID-19 (see Fig.2 A-B and Tab. S3) are presented by a quadruple {S, T, N, E}.
The sth (s ∈ S) travel restriction, which is imposed by the geographic area ns ∈ N at time ts ,
reduces the passenger influx of airline links in Es ∈ E with different strengths (See Methods

for details). As illustrated in Fig.2 A, the entry ban only reduces the passenger influx to banned
areas from area ns ; the global travel ban reduces the passenger influx from all neighbor areas to
enter the area ns ; the lockdown reduces the passenger influx entering/leaving the area ns .
Notice that the country distancing decreases with the number of OLs and increases with the
reduction of passenger influx induced by travel restrictions. Therefore, we consider the number of OLs and travel restriction as two separate factors that influence the changes of country
distancing over time, Dm|NI (ts ) and Dm|F (ts ) , where Dm|NI (ts ) + Dm|F (ts ) = Dm|(NI (ts ),F (ts ))
[see Eqs. (8)-(14)]. Fig.2C shows the influence of OLs and travel restrictions on country distancing from Jan-20 to Apr-4. From the early stage until Feb-22, mainland China is the only
OL. After Feb-22, an increase of the number of OLs occurs, |NI (ts )| > 1, and the average
P
country distancing DG|NI (ts ) (DG|NI (ts ) = m∈G Dm|NI (ts ) /M ) drops from 18.13 to 16.5. As
of Apr-4, |NI (ts )| increases to 119 areas, leading to a consecutive decrease in DG|NI (ts ) to 11.8.
Concurrently, the travel restrictions imposed before Feb-22 reduce a relatively small amount
P
of passenger influx given by n,m (Fnm (t0 ) − Fnm (ts )) as shown in Fig. 2D, and the average
country distancing DG|F (ts ) resulting from travel restrictions grows to 2.71 as shown in Fig. 2C.
After Feb-22, when |NI (ts )| = 5 at Feb-27, DG|F (ts ) is smaller than 0.1, enabling to conclude
that all travel restrictions after Feb-27 are not really effective. This fact also indicates that the
country distancing is further shortened to the number of OLs |NI (ts )|. Our analysis confirms
that the presence of multiple OLs magnifies areas’ risk of coronavirus importation. The risk of
importation can only be mitigated by rising substantially the effort of travel restrictions.
Through all the travel restrictions as of Apr-4, the arrival time delay reaches 16.69 days
(95% CI, 13.90 to 19.45) on average, and the infected case reduction reaches 1,257,257 (95%
CI, 281,475 to 6,051,856) in total, worldwide. We find that 337 (50.8%) of travel restrictions
are ineffective, leading to zero average increase in country distancing, as shown in Tab. S4.

The travel restrictions that lead to > 0.1 of DG|F

mainland China’s national lockdown on Feb-8, and Italy’s national lockdown on Feb-23. The
rest of 326 travel restrictions lead to nonzero increase in country distancing (see Fig. S5 and
Fig. S6), and their corresponding ATD and ICR are shown in Fig. 2E-F. Mainland China’s lockdown on Feb-8 results in 10.13 days of average ATD and 3871.22 of average ICR, separately
accounting for 60% of total ATD and 76.9% of total ICR. Italy’s lockdown on Feb-23 results
in 3.46 of average ATD, accounting for 20.7% of total average ATD. A few entry bans from
the {United States (US), Netherlands (NL), Russia (RU), Australia (AU)} to mainland China
(CN) results in > 0.1 of average ATD, and no global travel bans result in > 0.1 of average
ATD. Similarly, for the ICR, entry bans from {Hong Kong (HK), Italy (IT), Taiwan (TW)} to
mainland China results in > 100 of average ICR, and no global travel bans result in > 100 of
average ICR. Usually, the areas ns , which imposed travel restrictions have higher ATD and ICR
for itself than for other areas. For example, North Korea (KP)’s entry ban to mainland China
and North Korea ’s global travel ban respectively increase 3.81 and 7.62 ATD for North Korea.
Hong Kong (HK), Italy (IT), and Taiwan (TW) has most ICR, e.g., 88,346, 35,713, 18,911, for
their own areas through entry bans.
Next, we explore what type of travel restrictions are effective and visualize the shortest path
tree ΨOLs of three examples of travel restrictions, such as the US’s entry ban to mainland China,
North Korea’s global travel ban, and mainland China’s lockdown as shown in Fig. 3A-C. By
implementing an entry ban to mainland China on Jan-31, the US increases its own country
distancing by 0.69 and increases a total of 14.35 country distancing for the 26 areas, who are
descendants of the US in ΨOLs . Explicitly, an average of 3.49 ATD and a total of 0 ICR are for
the 26 descendant areas. On the other side, by imposing a global travel ban on Jan-21, North
Korea’s country distancing rises by 1.38 while induces no country distancing change for other
countries, because North Korea is a leaf node. Mainland China’s lockdown results in no self
country distancing change but increases a total of 2109.16 of country distancing for all other

227 areas. As all other areas are descendants of mainland China, an OL, an average of 10.13
of ATD, and an average of 3817 ICR occur. Similarly, Italy, another OL, leads to no change
in itself country distancing but increases a total of 722 country distancing for other 226 areas
by imposing lockdown on Feb-23. Explicitly, an average of 3.46 ATD and an average of 43.23
occur for other 226 areas. The previous statistics reveal that OLs have the most significant
influence when distancing the world because they are the sources of the shortest path tree ΨOLs .
The effective travel restrictions share the same feature as restricting passengers from outbreak
locations entering to other areas. The more passengers from outbreak locations are prevented
from entering into more areas, the more effective the travel restriction is. In other words, among
the travel restrictions preventing passengers from outbreak locations from exiting, the travel
restrictions that are imposed by the areas who have more descendant areas in ΨOLs are more
effective.

Contribution and Benefit via Travel Restrictions. In Fig3.D-F, we show that areas with
an increase in country distancing till Feb-4, Mar-4, and Apr-4 in the shortest-path tree. Corre4

spondingly, the areas’ ATD (Tm|F
(tS ) ) and ICR (Im|F (tS ) ) till Feb-4, Mar-4, and Apr-4 are shown

in Fig. S7. As of Feb-4, areas and their branch areas increase their country distancing mainly
by imposing entry bans to mainland China, leading to 0.32 of the average country distancing
increase. As of Mar-4, the average country distancing increase is 3.19 worldwide, mainly due
to mainland China’s lockdown and Italy’s lockdown. As of Apr-4, only an additional increase
of 0.69 in country distancing occur, proving the inefficiency of travel restrictions in March. We
also rank the most beneficial areas due to the increases in country distancing, ATD, and ICR, respectively (Tab. S6). Note that Tuvalu (TV), North Korea (KP), and Turkmenistan (TM), which
are not infected until Apr-4, are the top three areas with most ATD, i.e., 36.65 days, 35.3 days,
and 31.62 days, respectively. Hong Kong (HK), South Korea (KR), and Italy (IT), which are

infected at the early stage, are the top three areas with most ICR, i.e., 394,976 cases, 218,800
cases, and 160,766 cases, individually. These findings refute the unconscious statement considering that travel restrictions are only useful for the areas that are not infected. Our analysis
suggests that wise travel restrictions imposed at the early stage, could delay the arrival times for
uninfected areas and reduce the infected cases for infected areas by continuously lowering the
importation risk from OLs.
Since geographic areas implemented different travel restrictions, we integrate the increase
in country distancing for travel restrictions imposed by same areas ns . We also integrate the
ATD and ICR at area m due to the travel restrictions imposed by the same areas ns . The ATD
and ICR of areas in the same continents brought by area ns ’s travel restrictions are shown in
Fig. 4. Mainland China has the most significant contributions to the world, accounting for 69%
of the increase in country distancing, 63.7% of ATD, and 80.5% of ICR. Mainland China’s
contribution of ATD is relatively uniformly distributed throughout the six continents, but its
contribution of ICR mainly to Asia. Italy gives rise to 23.6% of country distancing increase,
18.5% of ATD, and 3.7% of ICR. Italy’s contribution of ATD is to Africa, North Korea, South
Korea, and Europe, and its contribution of ICR is mainly to Europe. Hong Kong brings in
0.02% of the increase in country distancing, 0.3% of ATD, but an excellent 7.0% of ICR,
mainly for Asia. We show the other geographic areas’ contributions in Fig. S8 and Tab. S7.
Africa has the longest ATD due to the relatively fewer infected countries in the continent when
some significant travel restrictions are implemented, followed by South America, North Korea,
Oceania, Europe, and Asia (see Fig. S9). The Asian continent has benefited most from ICR
because Asian areas implemented travel restrictions at the early stage to protect themselves,
followed by Europe, North America, South America, Oceania, and Africa (see Fig. S9).

Recommendations for Effective and Economic Travel Restrictions.

After a comprehen-

sive analysis of existing travel restrictions, we find that most of them are inefficient for two
reasons: (1) the travel restrictions are imposed by geographic areas in an uncoordinated way
out of self-interest, failing to contribute to global good; (2) the sole travel restriction is not enacted in optimal time and optimal locations for the most significant self-interest. Lacking the
consideration of imposing the coordinated travel restrictions for the global good and strategical
plan of when and where to impose each travel restriction, though existing travel restrictions contribute to some increase in ATD and ICR, they are far from slowing the spread of COVID-19.
Severely, these travel restrictions created a huge unnecessary loss of passenger influx, ultimately
damaging the global economy and social instability (20, 33).
To address the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of the existing travel restrictions, we formulate it as a bi-objective optimization problem: maximizing the travel restrictions’ increase in
country distancing and minimizing the loss of airline passenger influx in GMN [see Eq. (20) in
Methods]. For each travel restriction s ∈ S, which reduces passenger influx of airline links in
set Es , we find its optimal solution s0 , which reduces passenger influx of each airline link in set
Es0 (|Es0 |=|Es |, Es0 ∈ E) with the strength α, like a set of entry bans. We use the Non-dominated
Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) to obtain non-dominated solutions for each travel re?
striction and present the approximate optimal solution, which has the largest DG|F
(ts0 ) in Fig.

5A-C. Our results show that the optimized travel restrictions significantly outperform the existing travel restrictions in the remaining passenger influx, the average arrival time delay (ATD),
and the average infected case reduction (ICR). Form Jan-20 to Feb-20, when mainland China
is the single outbreak location (shaded region in Fig. 5A-C), existing travel restrictions result
in 12.03 days of average ATD and 4718 cases of average ICR by reducing 295,957 passenger
influx (95.9% of passenger influx remains). The optimal travel restrictions reach the ATD of
average 17.86 days (vs. 12.03 days, 48% larger) and ICR of average 593,501 (vs. 4,718, 123

times larger) cases for the world. Besides, the optimal travel restrictions are more economical,
with 96.86% (vs. 95.9%, 0.96% larger) of the remaining passenger influx. Till Apr-4, the optimized travel restrictions could reach the ATD of average 35.84 days (vs. 16.69, 1.14 times
larger) and ICR of average 594,187 (vs. 5,029, 117 times larger) with 83.6% (vs. 67.1%, 16.5%
larger) of passenger influx remains. Particularly, a total of 135,474,636 of infected cases would
be reduced, which is far greater than the real-world infected cases with 2,432,959 as of Apr-4,
hinting that the spread of COVID-19 could be well mitigated with optimized travel restrictions.
Moreover, we compare the fraction of airline links/entry bans that restrict the passenger
influx from outbreak locations of the sth travel restrictions and its corresponding s0th optimized
travel restrictions in Fig. 5D. Only 29.4% of existing travel restrictions have over 80% airline
links/entry bans that restrict the passenger influx from outbreak locations. However, over 96%
of optimized travel restrictions have over 80% airline links that restrict the passenger influx from
outbreak locations, leading to a significant increase in ATD and ICR. Same with the analysis
of existing travel restrictions, entry bans to outbreak locations, and the lockdowns imposed by
outbreak locations, which prevent passengers from entering other areas, are the most effective
and economic ones. Observing Fig. 5A-D, we could conclude that well deployment of entry
bans to outbreak locations or the outbreak locations’ lockdowns could achieve a substantial
increase in ATD and ICR for the world, while preserving most of the passenger influx, especially
during the early stage.
Next, we examine when is the best time to impose travel restrictions by testing the differences of ATD and ICR if some travel restrictions targeting OLs are imposed d days earlier
(d < 0) or later (d > 0) in Fig. 5E-F. We consider the entry bans to mainland China and
mainland China’s national outbreak. We find that ATD and ICR decrease as the d increases, indicating the earlier to impose travel restrictions, the more ATD and ICR. The national lockdown
of mainland China has considerable influence. If the national lockdown is implemented (3, 6,

9) days earlier, it produces on average (0,0.05,0.3) more ATD and (581, 1143, 1748) more ICR
for the world, respectively. On the other hand, if the national lockdown is implemented (3, 6,
9) days later, it produces on average (0, 0.05, 0.05) less ATD and (994, 1366, 1855) less ICR
worldwide. These results suggest that for both the global good, the outbreak locations imposed
by lockdown and entry bans to outbreak locations should be enacted as early as possible.

Discussion. In summary, we quantify the effectiveness of travel restrictions (i.e., entry ban,
global travel ban, and lockdown) concerning COVID-19 with a proposed country distancing
metric. Mapping the country distancing metric to arrival time delay (ATD) and infected case
reduction (ICR), we estimate that average 16.69 days (95% CI, 13.90 to 19.45) are delayed
for the world and a total of 1,257,257 (95% CI, 281,475 to 6,051,856) infected cases are reduced for the world with all travel restriction as of Apr-4. The total infected cases after 16
(≈ 16.69) days of Apr-4 is 2,471,608, close to 2,432,959, the sum of the total infected cases
by Apr-4 (1,175,702) and the total reduced infected case (1,257,257). These statistics, to some
extent, validate the proposed metric. Similarly to existing studies (6, 34–36), we also establish
that mainland China effectively prevented further exportation of coronavirus to the rest of the
world. Mainland China delays an average of 11.6 (95% CI, 9.71 to 13.92) days of arrival times
of COVID-19 for the world and reduces a total of 1,012,33 (95% CI, 208210 to 4,959,094) infected case for the world. In addition, geographic areas like Italy, United States, New Zealand,
Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Turkey also make great efforts in preventing the importation
of coronavirus to their continents by enforcing airline traffic restrictions.
Through the analysis, we provide clues for the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing
travel restrictions, which are premature and lead to an uncontrolled COVID-19 transmission.
By maximizing travel restrictions’ increase in country distancing and minimizing the loss of
airline passenger influx, we find that well deployment of entry bans to OLs or OLs’ lockdowns

with global joint efforts as early as possible is sufficient to fight against COVID-19 effectively.
Careful plans of optimized travel restrictions enable the sustainable suppression of transmission
at a low-level, without the need for further radical approaches (e.g., global travel ban), which is
harmful to the economy.
Three limitations of this study may underestimate/overestimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions: (1) Incomplete and biased travel restrictions dataset. (2) Homogeneous assumptions
on the strengths of different travel restrictions. (3) Ignorance of the combined effect between
travel restrictions (international anti-contiguous polices) and local anti-contiguous policy, like
social-distancing policy, work from home, and school closure (37, 38). Nevertheless, this study,
all the same, provides profound implications that help to stop COVID-19. It offers economical
and efficient travel restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 while preserving global socioeconomic health. Specifically, it recommends that the outbreak locations should impose the
lockdowns as early as possible. The other geographic areas, which are not outbreak location,
should impose entry bans to outbreak locations as early as possible, and tailor their entry bans by
tracking the changes of outbreak locations. Furthermore, as the pandemic of COVID-19 is more
than a health crisis and may last to 2022 (39), geographic areas would continuously endure the
coronavirus importation risk from other infected areas and social instability. It is impossible to
curb the spread of COVID-19 with travel restrictions imposed by a single area. Thus, this study
recommends that the joint global implementation of travel restrictions in a coordinated way as
a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach is necessary to fight against COVID-19
and strengthen pandemic preparedness for the future. Moreover, as the country distancing is
independent with the epidemiological features of a disease, it is also applicable for seasonal
coronaviruses in high mutation rates and influenza.

Materials and Methods
Dataset
Travel Restrictions. We collect the travel restrictions expanding from Jan-21 to Apr-4. A number of 476 entry bans and 87 global travel bans are collected from Wikipedia: Travel restrictions
related to the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. Additionally, 100 lockdowns, including 13 full
lockdowns and 87 partial lockdowns are collected from ACAPS in the Humanitarian Data Exchange website (40), which summarizes the government measure regarding COVID-19. More
details about travel restrictions are provided in supplementary text.
Global Mobility Network (GMN). The 2013 global airline dataset provided by Official Aviation Guide includes daily passenger seats from departure airports to arrival airports. We construct the GMN G = (N, E, F ) by integrating the airports to M = 228 geographic areas and
averaging passenger seats (i.e., passenger flux per day) between areas. Here, N is the set of
areas, L is the set of airline links. The weighted link Fmn (Fmn ∈ F ) quantifies direct air traffic
(passengers per day) from area n to area m. More details about travel restrictions are provided
in supplementary text.
Geographic areas’ arrival times and confirmed cases of COVID-19. The daily counts
of COVID-19 infected cases from Jan-22 to Apr-4 are collected by Johns Hopkins University (41, 42). The arrival times of areas are collected from the Ding Xiang Yuan Website (43)
and Johns Hopkins University (41). Ding Xinag Yuan Website, a telemedicine platform in
mainland China, provides the timeline of updated new confirmed cases in different areas starting from Jan-1, 2020.

Reducing passenger influx for travel restrictions
We present the travel restrictions by a quadruple {S, T, N, E}, where S = {1, 2, ..., s, ..., S}
is the set of occurrence orders of travel restrictions, and T = {t1 , t2 , ..., ts , ..., tS } (ts ∈ T

and T ∈ [Jan-21,Apr-4]) is the set of occurrence dates of travel restrictions. By definitions,
N = {n1 , n2 , ..., ns , ..., nS } is the set of geographic area ns who imposed sth travel restriction,
and E = {E1 , E2 , ..., Es , ..., ES } is the set of airline links that are reduced passenger influx
by sth travel restriction, and Es ∈ E. Having the GMN G = (N, E, F ) and {S, T, N, E}, we
assume that (see Fig. 1A):
(1) An entry ban leads to α decline of passenger influx from ns to banned areas m (Es =
{(ns , m)}), i.e.,
Fmns (ts ) = Fmns (ts−1 )(1 − α).

(5)

(2) A global travel ban results in a reduction of passenger influx from neighbor areas m to ns
by β (Es = {(ns , m)|∀m, (ns , m) ∈ E}), i.e.,
Fns m (ts ) = Fns m (ts−1 )(1 − β).

(6)

(3) A lockdown reduces passenger influx by γ from neighbor areas m to ns and passenger influx
from ns to neighbor areas m (Es = {(n, m)|∀n = ns |m = ns , (n, m) ∈ E}), i.e.,
Fmns (ts ) = Fmns (ts−1 )(1 − γ).
(7)
Fns m (ts ) = Fns m (tts−1 )(1 − γ).
The other weighted links in set (m, n) ∈ E − Es which are not influenced by sth travel restriction, remain same, i.e., Fmn (ts ) = Fmn (ts−1 ) . We denote the passenger influx set for the sth
travel restriction as F (ts ). The total reduction of passenger influx for the sth travel restriction is
P
m,n (Fmn (t0 ) − Fmn (ts )) where Fmn (t0 ) ∈ F (t0 ) and F (t0 ) = F .

Country distancing for existing travel restrictions
As with the spread of the COVID-19, the outbreak locations (OLs), defined as areas whose
infected cases are greater than 100 NI (t) = {i, ∀i ∈ N &Ii (t) > 100}, are growing. Given the
passenger influx set F (ts ) and changing set of OLs NI (ts ) for the sth travel restriction, we

Travel restrictions increase the country distancing by decreasing passenger influx F (ts ), while
the number of OLs (|NI (ts )| decreases country distancing by promoting importation risk from
multiple OLs. To better understand the impact of travel restrictions on country distancing, we
exclude the change of country distancing that is caused by multiple OLs Dm|NI (ts ) :
Dm|F (ts ) = Dm|(NI (ts ),F (ts )) − Dm|NI (ts )

Bi-objective Optimization Problem

passenger influx as close as possible to 1 while maximizing the increase in country distancing.
To solve the problem of minimizing loss of passenger influx and maximizing country distancing, we adopt the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) (44), a wellknown fast sorting and elite multi-objective genetic algorithm. This algorithm can find the
solutions which are not dominated by any other solutions and are closer to the true Pareto optimal front in the solution space. The procedure for generating non-dominated fronts follows
the algorithm proposed in (44). Based on experiments, we finally choose a population of size

Figure 2: Country distancing, outbreak locations (OLs), and three types of travel restrictions
(i.e., entry ban, global travel ban, lockdown) from Jan-20 to Apr-4. (A) Illustration of how the
entry ban, global travel ban, and lockdown reduce airline passenger influx. When the colored
areas (in red, blue, and green) enforce the entry ban, the global travel ban, or the lockdown, the
passenger influx on corresponding links are reduced (solid links change to dotted links). (B)
Number of geographic areas that imposed travel restrictions as of Apr-4. The embedding subplot presents the number of geographic areas that imposed entry bans to the main five areas. (C)
Average country distancing (DG|(NI (ts ),F (ts )) ). Here, DG|NI (ts ) (black line) is the average country distancing resulting from OLs, and DG|F (ts ) (colored dots) is the average country distancing
resulting from travel restrictions. (D) Growth of outbreak locations |NI (ts )|, and the decline
of passenger influx F (ts ) caused by travel restrictions s ∈ S. (E) Arrival time delay (ATD)
caused by travel restrictions. (F) Infected case reduction (ICR) caused by travel restrictions. In
