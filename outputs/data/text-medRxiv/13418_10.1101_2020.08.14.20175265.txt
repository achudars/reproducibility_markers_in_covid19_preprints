Respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability are some health metrics that are easily measured by consumer devices and which can potentially provide early signs of illness. Furthermore,
mobile applications which accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported
symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against
the COVID-19 pandemic. We considered two approaches to assessing COVID-19 - a symptom-based
approach, and a physiological signs based technique. Firstly, we trained a Logistic Regression classifier to predict the need for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients given the symptoms experienced,
age, sex, and BMI. Secondly, we trained a neural network classifier to predict whether a person is
sick on any specific day given respiration rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability data for that
day and and for the four preceding days. Data on 1,181 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active
infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 - July 14, 2020. 11.0% of COVID-19 subjects were
asymptomatic, 47.2% of subjects recovered at home by themselves, 33.2% recovered at home with
the help of someone else, 8.16% of subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, and
0.448% required ventilation. Fever was present in 54.8% of subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 ± 0.05 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization.
Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 ± 0.03 for the prediction of illness on a
specific day with 4 previous days of history. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by
illness, while heart rate variability is decreased. Measuring these metrics can help in early diagnosis,
and in monitoring the progress of the disease.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The year 2020 has seen the emergence of a global pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The disease caused
by this virus typically presents as a lower respiratory infection, though many atypical presentations have been
reported. This has caused a major health challenge globally due to the apparent high transmissibility of this virus
in a previously unexposed population. Of particular concern is that the primary mechanisms by which the disease
is transmitted are still somewhat under debate (e.g., the
importance of airborne transmission)1 , and the potential
for infection by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients (see for e.g., the discussion in Oran & Topol2 ). The
disease is highly contagious, with transmission possible
2.3 days prior to the onset of symptoms, and peaking
0.7 days prior to the onset of symptoms according to one
model3 . As a result, a great deal of effort is underway to
potentially diagnose COVID-19 early.
The popularity and widespread availability of consumer wearable devices has made possible the use of
health metrics such as respiration rate, heart rate, heart
rate variability, sleep, steps, etc in order to predict the
onset of COVID-19 or similar illnesses. A 1◦ C rise in
body temperature can increase heart rate by 8.5 beats
per minute on average4 . Measuring the resting heart
rate, or heart rate during sleep can therefore be a useful
diagnostic tool. Similarly, the respiration rate is elevated
when patients present with a fever5 . Heart rate variability is the variability in the time between successive heart

beats (the time between successive heart beats is called
the “RR interval”), and is a valuable, non-invasive probe
of the autonomic nervous system6–8 . Lowered values are
indicative of increased mortality9 , and may provide early
diagnosis of infection10 . A study of heart rate variability in critically ill COVID-19 patients showed that the
approximate entropy and the sample entropy were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to critically ill
sepsis patients11 .
Zhu et al.12 studied heart rate, activity and sleep data
collected from Huami wearable devices to potentially
identify outbreaks of COVID-19, and concluded that
at a population level an anomaly detection algorithm
provided correlation with the measured infection rate.
Menni et al.13 analyzed symptoms reported through a
smartphone app and developed a model to predict the
likelihood of COVID-19 based on the symptoms. Marinsek et al.14 studied data from Fitbit devices as a means
for early detection and management of COVID-19. Miller
et al.15 used the respiration rate obtained from Whoop
devices to detect COVID-19. Mishra et al.16 analyzed
heart rate, steps, and sleep data collected from Fitbit
devices to identify the onset of COVID-19.
In this paper, we consider the correlation between
changes in physiological signs related to respiration rate,
heart rate and heart rate variability, and the corresponding presence of diseases assessed both through confirmed
laboratory testing and self-reported symptoms and the
time-course of the disease. We show that it is possible to
use changes in these physiological metrics to detect illness, and provide estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

In addition, given the reporting of symptoms by study
participants, we provide an estimate of predicted disease
severity based solely on symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A.

Data Collection

Fitbit is a global leader in wearable technology since
2007, and has a large established base of users (over 30
million as of 2020). A significant percentage of its devices
are configured to measure heart rate, and the underlying
interbeat intervals (RR) that characterize heart rate variability. The Fitbit app provides a convenient user-facing
app that can be configured to present user-facing questions, and to reliably capture responses in a secure and
scalable way. In this study, active Fitbit users in the
USA and Canada were invited to participate in a survey
of whether they have experienced COVID-19 or similar
infections, whether they had been tested, and to report
on symptoms they experienced. They could also optionally provide additional demographic data such as age,
sex, body mass index, and relevant background medical
information such as underlying conditions such as diabetes, coronary arterial disease, or hypertension. While
the researcher hypothesis was that metrics that could be
generated from heart rate were likely to be most predictive of infectious disease, we did not restrict the survey
to only Fitbit users with heart rate enabled devices (in
practice 95% of survey respondents had heart rate enabled devices).
The survey and associated marketing and recruitment materials were approved by an Institutional Review Board (Advarra) and from May 21st 2020, the survey was available for completion by Fitbit users in the
USA and Canada. The data presented here represent
the analysis on survey results collected up to July 14,
2020. The survey contained the following questions in
relation to COVID-19 and other likely confounding infectious diseases such as influenza, urinary tract infections
etc. - a) have you been tested for COVID-19 (with separate sections provided for tests for active infection versus
serological tests for previous infection), b) what were the
symptoms experienced and the dates of onset and disappearance of the symptoms, c) were you tested for other
infectious diseases such as influenza, strep throat etc.
Table I shows the overall breakdown of the survey responses as well as providing summary demographic information on the survey respondents. The age distribution of survey respondents was very similar to Fitbit users’ overall age distribution. Survey respondents
skewed slightly more female than the corresponding figure for the overall general Fitbit population.
Table II describes the self-reported major comorbidities of the participants who reported a positive
diagnosis of COVID-19, either through a confirmed PCR
test or a serological test (we assume that the vast major-

also decline to answer this question, so these numbers are
only indicative of general trends in the disease population.
In order to assess some metric of disease severity, we
took the approach of asking about the person’s treatment
rather than through quantification of symptoms. The
options provided to a survey participant were:

We consider 1 as asymptomatic. 2 is assigned to category “mild”. 3 is assigned to “moderate”, 4 is “severe”
and 5 is “critical”. 11.0% of participants were asymptomatic, 47.2% had mild symptoms, 33.2% were moderate, 8.16% severe, and 0.448% critical. Those with mild
symptoms recovered sooner than those with moderate or
severe symptoms. The distribution in the duration of
symptoms is shown in Fig. 1.

Making predictions based on health metrics and
symptoms

Firstly, we wished to use the self-reported symptoms
as a classifier of likely need for hospitalization. Using

FIG. 1: Distribution of symptom duration for mild, moderate and severe/critical cases. The median symptom duration
is 8 days for mild cases, 15 days for moderate cases, and 24
days for severe/critical cases.

the symptoms along with the age, sex, and BMI as input features, we trained a logistic regression classifier to
predict the need for hospitalization. We only considered
symptomatic individuals for this analysis.
Secondly, we considered the use of physiological signs
to predict the presence of symptoms associated with
COVID-19. Let us denote the nth day relative to the
start of symptoms as Dn . D0 thus represents the day
when symptoms started. We make the assumption that
individuals are healthy, i.e. class “Negative” from day
Da to day Db where Db < D0 . The days between Db
and D0 are treated as a buffer space when subjects may
or may not be sick, and hence, ignored. Subjects are
considered to be sick from day Dc up to day Dd where
Dc ≥ D0 . The choices of Da , Db , Dc , and Dd are made
through cross validation. As a guide to choosing the days,
we note the median incubation period is estimated at 5.1
days17 . Since we are using the date relative to the start
of symptoms as the ground truth label, we consider only
symptomatic individuals.
The following physiological data was calculated for
each user on a daily basis using the data recorded from
their Fitbit device:
• The estimated mean respiration rate during deep
(slow wave) sleep (we default to light sleep if deep

sleep data is insufficient).
• The mean nocturnal heart rate during non-Rapid
Eye Movement (NREM) sleep.
• The Root Mean Square of Successive Differences
(RMSSD) of the nocturnal RR series.
• The Shannon entropy of the nocturnal RR series.
Data are collected simultaneously from the PPG sensor and the accelerometer. RR data are only stored when
no motion above a set threshold is detected, and when
the coverage in a 5 minute window exceeds 70%. Data
are only collected when the subjects are at rest. The
RR data are then cleaned to remove noise due to missed
heart beats, motion artifacts, electronic noise, etc. The
Fitbit system estimates periods of light, deep (slow wave)
and REM sleep18 and this is used in deciding which sections of the overnight data to process. The respiration
rate is obtained by fitting a Gaussian model to the spectrum of the interpolated RR intervals as a function of
frequency - this relies on the phenomenon of respiratory
sinus arrhythmia (RSA) to induce a measurable modulation of the RR interval series. In cases where there is
no discernible RSA, we do not estimate the respiration
rate. The RMSSD is a time domain measurement used
to estimate vagally mediated changes8 . It is computed
in 5 minute intervals, and the median value of these individual measurements over the whole night is calculated.
The Shannon entropy is a non-linear time domain measurement computed using the histogram of RR intervals
over the entire night. The RMSSD and entropy are computed between midnight and 7 am. The sleeping heart
rate is estimated from non-REM sleep only. The respiration rate is computed from deep sleep when possible,
and from light sleep in the case of insufficient deep sleep.
Since health metrics such as respiration rate, heart
rate, and heart rate variability can vary substantially between users, we use the Z−scored equivalents:
Zx =

x − µx
,
σx

(1)

where x could stand for respiration rate, heart rate,
RMSSD, or entropy. µx and σx are the rolling mean
and rolling standard deviation of the metric being measured. For each day Dn , we construct a 5 × 4 matrix with
the normalized Z−scores corresponding to the 4 health
metrics, measured on days Dn · · · Dn−4 . Each day is represented by a matrix with that day’s data along with the
previous four days data. Each row of the matrix represents a day of data, while each column represents a metric. We linearly interpolate missing data, but only do so
if there is a minimum of 3 days of data. We create an
“image” from each matrix by resizing each 5 × 4 matrix
to a 28 × 28 × 1 matrix, with the last dimension indicating that there is only one color channel. The pixel values
are rescaled to the range (0,1). We included 673 symptomatic individuals with sufficient data for analysis. 70%

training set. The remaining 30% of subjects were split
equally into 2 hold-out sets: one for cross-validation, and
one for testing.
Fig. 2 shows the neural network architecture. Each
image is input to a 1-dim. convolutional stage with m
filters, and a filter size of k. After maxpooling, the convolutional stage produces a set of m features. Non-linearity
in the form of a “Relu” layer is introduced. A dense layer
is used to reduce the m convolutional features to a small
feature set N1 . At this stage, an array of n external inputs is applied including features such as age, gender,
and BMI that need to bypass the convolutional stage.
We also input the sleep efficiency for day Dn defined as
the ratio of time asleep to the duration between wake
time and bed time. In addition, we also include the Zscored respiration rate, heart rate, RMSSD, and entropy
for day Dn as a part of the array. The final dense layer
leads to a softmax layer with two possible output classes.

day D0 represents the start of symptoms. The error bars
represent the standard error of the mean. The respiration rate shows the largest effect and also takes the
longest time to return to its base value. The duration
between day ≈ D+7 and ≈ D+21 may be thought of as
a recovery phase during which the health metrics return
to their normal values. It is interesting to note that the
heart rate decreases on average, following day D+7 , and
returning to the base value by day D+20 . The HRV metrics on the other hand, are slightly elevated on average
in the recovery phase. We did not notice a decrease in
respiration rate on average, during this phase.
We trained a convolutional neural network to predict
whether an individual is sick on any specific day given
the Z−scores for respiration rate, heart rate, RMSSD,
and entropy for that day and the preceding four days.
Using the cross-validation set, we obtained the best performance considering negative classes from day D−21 to
day D−8 . The days from D−7 to D0 are discarded. Data
for the positive classes come from day D+1 to day D+7 .
The filter size k for 1-dimensional convolution was set to
5 pixels, while the number of filters m was set to 64. A
drop-out of p = 0.4 was applied for regularization. The

ROC curve where “true positive” indicates a prediction
of hospitalization for an individual who indeed required

where α = −3.3457, si is a symptom (1 if the symptom is present, and 0 otherwise), and wi is the weight
corresponding to symptom si . The weights for the various symptoms are shown in Table IV. We rescale the 2
continuous variables (age and BMI) as follows:
xs =

where xs is the scaled version and x stands for age or
BMI. µx and σx are the respective mean and standard

indicates female.
Let us now consider the problem of determining
whether an individual is sick or healthy given the physiological metrics. Fig. 4 show the average Z-scores of

respiration rate and heart rate are elevated during times of sickness, while the RMSSD and entropy are decreased. These

as a recovery period during which the heart rate is slightly below the normal value, while the HRV is slightly elevated. The

The data are randomly split into training and hold-out

the results. The AUC for the four folds was found to be

Having set the network parameters, we retrained the
classifier using all available data up to June 1, 2020. Data
after June 1 was set aside a hold-out set for testing. On
this dataset, the AUC was found to be 0.80, with a sensitivity of 47% at a specificity of 95%. Fig. 6 shows

swab test, in the time period May 21 - July 14, 2020. All
subjects wore Fitbit devices and resided in the United

States or Canada. The overall positivity rate was 7.26%.
11.0% of reported cases were asymptomatic. 8.16% of
subjects required hospitalization without ventilation support, while 0.448% required ventilation. Fatigue was the
most common symptom, present in 72% of cases. Symptoms such as rash and swelling in the fingers and toes
presented rarely in less than 10% of cases.

FIG. 6: Fraction of users in the test set who predict positive. The solid, blue curve in (a) shows the predictions for a
95% specificity scenario, while the dashed, green curve shows
the same, for 90% specificity. Plot (b) shows the same predictions (95% specificity) but for subjects who present with
specific symptoms. The presence of a fever (dashed, green)
or a cough (dot-dashed, red) increases the probability of detection more than some other symptoms such as congestion
(dotted, black). Plot (c) shows the same curves (95% specificity), but for different severity. As expected, severe (dotted,
black) and moderate (dot-dashed, red) cases are easier to detect than mild (dashed, green) cases.

The duration of symptoms depends on the severity:
Mild cases show a median duration of 8 days, while moderate cases have a median duration of 15 days. The median duration for cases that required hospitalization was
found to be 24 days with a large spread, with several
cases with duration exceeding 2 months. We provided a
simple formula to estimate the need for hospitalization
given the symptoms, age, sex, and BMI. Shortness of
breath is highly indicative of the need for hospitalization,
while sore throat and stomach ache were the least likely.
Rather surprisingly, gastrointestinal symptoms such as
vomiting and loss of appetite were indicative of severe illness. Among demographic information, being older and
having a high BMI show higher likelihoods for hospital-

We showed that respiration rate, heart rate, and heart
rate variability are useful indicators of the onset of illness. We trained a convolutional neural network to predict illness on any specific day given health metrics for
that day and the preceding four days. With 95% specificity, this classifier can detect 40% of cases on day D+1 ,
where D0 is the date when symptoms present. The classifier can detect 25% of cases on day D0 , and 21% of
cases on day D−1 . For the 90% specificity case, the
corresponding numbers are 52% on day D+1 , 32% on
day D0 , and 29% on day D−1 . The peak values for the
95% (90%) specificity scenarios are 52% (59%) on day
D+4 (day D+5 ). Considering only subjects who present
with a fever, we classify 63% of subjects as positive, on
day D+6 , with 95% specificity. The fraction who are
classified positive increases with increased severity, but
this effect is pronounced several days after the start of
symptoms. Considering only subjects who show a moderate/severe/critical presentation, 65% of subjects are classified positive on day D+4 , with 95% specificity.
This study has multiple limitations which may confound some of its findings. The survey participants were
all Fitbit users which may not represent the general US
and Canadian population, and were all self-selecting in
responding to the survey. Participants were asked to selfrecall the start-date and end-date of any symptoms they
experienced which may be quite unreliable. Participants
may also confuse active (PCR) tests with serological (antibody) tests. In order to simplify the survey, we did not
ask for a breakdown of symptom presentation and severity through out the time-course of the disease. For the
prediction of the need for hospitalization, our data consisted of 95 positive cases and 926 negative cases, so it is
possible that our results are potentially affected by the
small number of positive cases, as well as by the class
imbalance.
Nevertheless, we believe this survey provides an
important scientific contribution by suggesting (a)
hospitalization risk can be calculated from self-reported
symptoms, and (b) relevant and predictive physiological
signs related to COVID-19 may be detected by consumer
wearable devices.
