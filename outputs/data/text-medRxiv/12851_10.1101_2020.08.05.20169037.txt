Abstract
The recent global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) disease has prompted
many researchers to formulate lock-down and quarantine scenarios while the main
concern of the researchers is to model the spread and the possible duration of the
COVID-19 infections and also research on how long this is going to last. It seems
that most of the researchers have recognized lock-down as one of the major impact
factors in their models. As a result of this in the absence of lock-down the models
formulated would not contribute much significant results. Hence, in this work
we decide to formulate a mathematical model which would be able to predict the
spread and also the possible duration of the pandemic, by considering both partial
lock-down and the corresponding unlocking situations. Employing SIR-network
models and taking the various districts of highly populated areas of West Bengal,
India as the nodes or vertices we attempt to model the spread and duration of
the pandemic during both partial lock-down and unlock phases but separately. We
consider the populations where the locally present people and the people who have
undergone migration of some shorts are well mixed together. In the network that
we have provided the pointed edges refer to the migrating workers that is those
that move away from their regular habitats in want of work. We use this research
to study not only the trends that are associated with COVID-19 outbreaks, but also
to study the impacts of the Government policies and the improvisation of medical

upon the crisis that the economy of the state may have to go through separately on

1. Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was originated, from Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China [1, 2], and quickly
spread to all Chinese provinces. Despite of introducing prompt radical measures
to control the outbreak [3], over the course of less than three months it has spread
to 58 other countries [4] and was diagnosed as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID19) in February, 2020, by WHO. The World Health Organisation report dated 25th
May 2020 reported 53,04,772 total cases and 3,42,029 deaths worldwide [5].
India has been severely affected. After the first indigenous case on 30th January 2020 in Kerala (southern province) [6], very few new cases were discovered during February. Over the month of March, several cases began to emerge
across India [7, 8, 9] and India enters the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
list of areas where the virus has been reported. As a consequence, multiple states
across the country began shutting down schools, colleges, public facilities such as
malls, gyms, cinema halls and other public places to contain the spread [10, 11].
Further, due to the mass spread of infection, and increasing pressure on hospital
capacity following the examples of other countries India officially implemented:
lock-downs, mobility restrictions, quarantine hospitals, increase in public health
measures, protection of the elderly, etc. [12]. As per Ministry of Home Affairs
(MHA) order [13] a district-wise zonal classification system was instituted on
3rd May 2020, comprises of a ‘red zone’, encompassing 170 hot-spot districts
where SARS-CoV-2 infection was endemic, ‘green zone’ including 219 districts
with zero confirmed cases till date or no confirmed case in the last 21 days, ‘orange zones’ comprising of 284 districts which are neither in the Red zone nor in
the Green zone, and put on the extension of the second phase of the nationwide
lock-down to contain the emerging threat. Although different corrective measures
have slowed the spread of infection, the cost to the economy of such measures is
considerable. For instance, with the first 1.5 months of lock-down in India it is
estimated that the crisis is expected to cost nearly 4percentage of its GDP [14].
Beginning 1st June the Government has started unlocking the country (barring
containment zones) in three unlock phases.

COVID-19 is an acute and new disease spread by a virus belongs to corona
family that is growing significantly worldwide with a name known as SARS-CoV2 and are related to genetically the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. The
estimated basic reproductive values (R0 ) of SARS-CoV-2 at the early stage were
calculated between 2 and 3.5, indicating that one patient could transmit the disease to two to three other people, [15, 16, 17] which was higher than SARS and
MERS. A study from China showed [18], a large number of transmissions can
be occurred, both in nosocomial and community settings. Through feces, and
aerosols transmission SARS-CoV-2 spread is also highly possible. The viral load
of SARS-CoV-2 detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the
symptomatic patients. Majority of infected individuals with no or mild symptoms
can release viruses while coughs or exhales and spread viruses to others through
small droplets, and becomes the cause of pandemic disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality within a period of weeks, which is extremely
challenging for preventing the spread of COVID-19 without the exploration of a
vaccine. Viral shedding pattern of the patients infected with SARS-COV-2 is analogous to that of influenza viruses [19]. These findings suggest that, in-apparent
transmission may play an important role in sustaining the outbreak.
To understand the process of disease transmission during the course of the epidemic and how to plan effective control strategies Predictive mathematical models
have been studied for decades [20, 21, 22, 23]. One commonly used compartmental model is the SIR model [24] for portraying the dynamics of infectious disease
transmission, which describes the flow of individuals with three mutually exclusive stages of infection or compartments: susceptible, infected and recovered.
More complex models can be utilized for modeling infectious disease dynamics. Researchers [25, 26, 27, 28] have developed several mathematical models for
COVID 19 pandemic. As well as this, Lin and colleagues [25] have developed an
SIR model considering risk perception and the number of cases , Anastassopoulou
et al. [26] have proposed a separate time SIR model with the dead populations,
Casella [27] has developed a control-based SIR model that emphasizes the effects of delays and compares results on the basis of containment policies, Wu
and colleagues [28] have used infection dynamics to estimate the clinical severity
of COVID-19. Wang et al.[29] have presented some critical reviews for mathematical models for the prevalence of COVID-19. Fang et al. [30] have presented an overall analysis of the transmission rate due to COVID-19 using the
SEIR model. Hou et al. [31] have reported the quarantine effectiveness against

coronavirus 2019 (COVD-19) in Wuhan, China. Radulescu and Cavanagh [32]
have discussed the management strategies of COVID 19 community spreads using the SEIR model. Pandey et al. [33] have predicted the outbreak of COVID-19
in India based on SEIR and regression models. Stochastic transmission models
have also been considered [34, 35]. Besides that, Ndairou et al.[36] have proposed a sectional mathematical model based on SEIPAHRF for the proliferation of
COVID-19 disease with a special focus on the contagiousness of super-spreaders.
Recently, Khatua et al. [37] have predicted the pandemic on Indian aspect by
control-based SEIAR model and also have developed a control-based SEIAHRD
model [38] with the uncertain transmission parameters.
Here we propose to employ a SIR-network model for the COVID-19 epidemic
in India, that extends the classical SIR model, to capture the impact of human mobility in future progress of the disease. SIR-network model was introduced in
[39, 40, 41, 42] for analyzing the epidemic models into networks. These models
consider that the ideal networks are made up of nodes that represent regions/ affected regions/affected areas and links that mimic interactions or connections between them. In our study we consider SIR-network model as a Predictive model
with the aims to (i)understand the consequence of unlocking decision in the future disease progression (ii) recognize the facts that the infection with COVID-19
may reach its saturation level within a time frame after an easing of partial lockdown restrictions provided social distancing is maintained. Our model does not
consider reduced availability of medical heath care i.e., recovery rate of the infection is retained trough out the simulation. Specifically, in designing this model
as a simplification of COVID-19 dynamics, local transmission parameters reveal
variations in environmental characteristics such as recovery rate, death rate, transmission rate. Here we stress on a heterogeneous network to explore the mobility
of people to be an essential ingredient in analyzing the epidemic. The focus of
our analysis is to understand the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak pattern during and
after partial lock-down restrictions by which to find the pathway of releasing the
people from an uncertain black box and enable then to plan the way forward.
2. The model formulation
In this part, we have pulled in some discussions about the fundamentals of a
meta-population model [43, 44, 45, 46, 42]. Metaphorical models are usually applied to identify the kinetics of an epidemic in various environment. For example,
Arino and van den Driessche [45] have analyzed the spread of a disease among
different cities and have thought the possibility of migration between them. Their

findings explore the importance of human mobility in epidemic problems. Nevertheless, in the case of COVID-19 in an undivided province, we are interested in
daily movement between neighborhoods. This is why the short-term scale of our
model is one day, and we can put aside the tedious rate of migration and demographics. The idea of thinking to build up a metaphorical network is interesting.
We can imagine a large state being roughly divided into districts with a population
of millions. The choice of this scale should be driven by the number of COVID19 patients and the available detailed information on the human travel pattern between the intermediate districts. The effect of the geometry of human transport
networks on the spread of disease is another interesting aspect to be explored.
This can be measured using road traffic studies and data from public transport
companies. For a large province, it is common to get that some territories have
stronger links than others.
Mathematically, we presume that the district has X neighborhoods (corresponding to nodes of the network) and we denote the set as V = (1, 2, · · · , n).
A node i is linked to another j if there is a fraction of residents of i that travel to
j. Here we assume that the network is asymmetric means the edges are not bidirectional. In this case, the geometry of the network is then defined by specifying
the flux matrix Ψ,

whose entries ψij ∈ [0, 1] are the fraction of resident population going from i to
j. It is important to note that the ψij ’s are dimensionless. As discussed in more
detail [39], we assume that each node contains a conservation of the residential
population, and as consequence the fraction satisfies

Definition 1. We define a homogeneous network model as one where all nodes
have the same rate of transmission, ηj = η0 , ∀j = 1, 2, · · · , n. All other examples
are defined to be heterogeneous.
2.1. SIR-Network model
A SIR model is introduced by placing individuals into three segments such
as susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered or removed (R) for the pandemic

COVID-19. Susceptible is a group of people who are at risk of contracting the
disease form infected people. They might become patient if infected. The infected people can pass the disease on to susceptible people and recover within a
certain period of time. A susceptible person can be tainted by the virus due to
close contact with an infected person. Since the disease can be transmitted from
person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, so we take
η here as the rate of infection or contact between susceptible or infected people. Then the part Nη S(t)I(t) goes to the susceptible class to the infected class.
We take the δ as the natural mortality rate per capita for each of the three segments, treatment recovery rate as τ , average duration of infectivity as β and the
disease related mortality as γ. In our model, new births and migration are ignored.
Therefore, network models with infectious energy follow dormant and infectious
periods which are represented as follows

˙ = S(t)I(t) − (τ + β + γ + δ)I(t)
I(t)

Ṙ(t) = (τ + β)I(t) − δR(t)

(3)

where N = S + I + R is the total population. Initially the mathematical role
of epidemic problems was accomplished with such conditions S(0) > 0, I(0) >
0, R(0) > 0.
For any node i ∈ V , let Si (t), Ii (t) and Ri (t) be the number of susceptible, infectious and recovered/removed persons, respectively, in neighbourhood i at the time
t. The total population individuals at i is considered as a constant at time t and is
given by
Ni = Si (t) + Ii (t) + Ri (t)
Furthermore, since ψki Nk is the total population of the node k that travels to the
node i every day, we can define
Niq =

as the present population at i, which is also constant at the time and Niq is a
normalizing factor[45].
The transmission rate (or incidence rate) of an infection is the probability or
risk of infection in the population. It is employed to evaluate the absorption of
fresh instances of infection in a population over a point of time. For this pandemic

case, we set ηj as the transmission rate at the node j for all j ∈ V . For every group
of populations, we follow the assumptions that the recovery rate (τ ), the average
viremic period (β), the disease related mortality rate (γ) and the natural death rate
(δ) of every infected individuals are constants. Then the dynamical system- (3)
can be expressed as the following first-order homogeneous system of differential

The double-summation terms enable us to model the fact that any resident of location k can acquire an infection at location j, by an individual person from location
i, provided that the corresponding fraction ψij are non zero.
2.2. Basic reproduction number
The number of basic reproductions R0 is the number of secondary cases that
occur in a case of completely susceptible population. It has become common
practice in the analysis of the simplest models to consider the next generation
matrix process [47] and to define the basic reproduction number R0 as the expected number of secondary infection produced in a fully susceptible population
by a common infected person during the entire period of infection. Thus R0 may
vary significantly for different infectious diseases as well as for the same disease
in different populations. The key threshold criterion then states: the disease can
pandemic if R0 > 1, whereas it cannot if R0 < 1. To establish the R0 for the
SIR-network model, we begin by introducing vector notation, since infected individuals are from different nodes of the network. Let Si ∗ = Ni and Ii ∗ = 0 are
balanced population of the susceptible and infected populations at the node i. We
define the following notations at the time t as
S(t) = (S1 (t), S2 (t), · · · , Sn (t))T , ∆S(t) = (∆S1 (t), ∆S2 (t), · · · , ∆Sn (t))T ,
I(t) = (I1 (t), I2 (t), · · · , In (t))T , ∆I(t) = (∆I1 (t), ∆I2 (t), · · · , ∆In (t))T
where Si (t) = Si ∗ + ∆Si (t) and Ii (t) = Ii ∗ + ∆Ii (t) (i = 1, 2, · · · , n) are the
number of susceptible and infected persons at the vertex i at the time t. In fact,

different groups. Replacing the outline forms in (4) and linearizing , we find

Proposition 1. [42] Let (V, ψn×n ) be the network given by a vertices set V =
1, 2, · · · , n and a flux matrix ψ = [ψij ]n×n of the system (4), describing the SIR1
and K as in (5), we have
network dynamics. Then, by considering ∆t = τ +β+γ+δ
that I(tm+1 ) = KI(tm ) describes the discrete dynamics of the system linearized
about the equilibrium state (Si ∗ , Ii ∗ ) = (Ni , 0) for all i ∈ V . In particular, the
first generation of infected individuals is given by I(t1 ) = KI0 .
Following the results of Proposition- 1, if we identify an infected person in a
disease-free population through the surrounding area i, i.e., if Ii (0) = 1 for some
i ∈ V and Ij (0) = 0 otherwise, then the sum

can vary from one end to the other. Here we see a correspondence with the expression for the basic reproduction number of the SIR model- (3), is given by

3. Case study
3.1. Introduction
In this section we construct a simple application of SIR-Network model on
the West Bengal, which is an eastern regional state of India on the Bay of Bengal.
With a population of over 91 million (as of 2011), it is the fourth most populous
state in India. West Bengal is also the seventh most populous regional entity in the
universe. West Bengal is the thirteenth largest state in India with an expanse of
88,752 km2 (34,267 sq mile). It is bounded by Bangladesh to the east and Nepal
and Bhutan to the northward. It is also surrounded by the Indian provinces of
Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim and Assam. The state capital and biggest city
of the state is a Kolkata—the third-biggest urban agglomeration and the seventhbiggest metropolis in India [49]. As of 2017, West Bengal is divided into 23
districts [49] (Figure-1).
Specifically, we chose to test a period when transportation between the districts has barely been started. At this time there were 3816 total registered cases
and 278 total deaths in the whole District(as on 25th May,2020)[50]. In order to
simplify our analysis, first task is to choose a representative part of the state. For
this, instead of considering the whole of West Bengal in the simulation, we study
a small but interesting regions of the whole integrated network. The network is
developed by considering 8 districts connected by railways and passenger vehicle
transportation system with the center Kolkata. All the selected regions are announced as a red zone or orange zone by state or central government (Figure-2).
The set of regions are described in subsection- 3.2. For the selected region we
create a specific flux matrix(see- 1 for the definition) inspired by the features that
we want to find out in the network. This is made in subsection- 3.3. Then, in
subsection- 3.4 we estimate the epidemiological parameters so that we can simplify our analysis. In subsection- 3.5 we identify our assumptions regarding the
data and the duration for which the fits will run.
3.2. The selection of regions
West Bengal is a huge and complex state of India: about 10 crore people
live here in different conditions. As mentioned earlier, in the state West Bengal,
Kolkata is the capital of the province. Kolkata is the financial center for both the

West Bengal and eastern India. The most important industrial belt of the country is a corridor extending north and south of Kolkata along the banks of the
Hooghly River [52]. That’s why most of the people from other districts go in
want of work or for other purposes to Kolkata on daily base. Thus, we choose
Kolkata district as the centre of the network. In order to bridge the existing gap
between rural and urban areas, Kolkata has adopted a multimodal transport system where railways play an significant part in raising the regional connectivity
between Kolkata and the suburban areas. The districts around Kolkata are connected to the city by an improved suburban rail network (3). The suburban railway areas of Kolkata covers nine districts of South Bengal, for example Burdwan,
Nadia, Hooghly, Howrah, East and West Midnapore, North and South 24 Parganas including Kolkata district itself [53]. Therefore the another 8 districts of the
network are: East Medinipore(n1 ), West Midnapore(n2 ), North 24 Parganas(n3 ),
Howrah(n4 ), South 24 Parganas(n5 ), Hoogly(n6 ), Nadia(n7 ) and Burdwan(n8 ).

3.3. Construction of Flux matrix
Initially for defining the network, we build a flux matrix based on selected districts. Among 9 districts, there are some districts, those are not such a significant
spot to be considered as employment center. Therefore, the edges are not bidirectional and for this case the network is asymmetric. Here, we adopt that each
node contains a conservation of the residential population, so the essence of the
constituents of each row of the matrix is 1. Such a matrix usually describes the societal construction of regions C, n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 , n5 , n6 , n7 , n8 . Here, for constructing the flux matrix some logical assumptions are followed. At the Beginning, let’s
presume that very few people living in the central district go to another district for
work and we neglect that part. People who live in n1 , n2 , n3 , n4 , n5 , n6 , n7 , n8 visit
the central C for doing work. We do not recognize the precise figure of masses
who move from one district to another district (besided central city) for work. It
is observed as per census report [54] that overall migration percentage is around
15% due to work and employment throughout the country. With this, to fix the
values of the parameters to build the flux matrix, we assume the percentage of
each vertex that works within the district is 98% and that leaves home for work
in others is 2%. Since, inter district migration is not much observed for Kolkata
city as per census record, we include intra district employment by fixing ψ11 = 1
and rest of the variables are taken as zero. For more precise study we also employ
the data set of Suburban train services of south eastern railway (connecting south,
east and north of West Bengal) that includes total number of trains daily piled,
their frequencies, number of coaches per train, capacity of each coach and the total number of passengers carried by these trains and finally develop the concerned
flux matrix as follows.

3.4. Data source
There are practical difficulties in resolving the actual number of infections,
since most cases of covid-19 are non-communicable or the symptoms are influenzalike, for example. Unfortunately, the data obtained only measures the number of
people who have visited the hospital for treatment. Thus, we can say that the measurements are significantly below the estimates of the total infected population.
We gather epidemiological data from the following publicly available data
sources: covid19india.org: Coronavirus Outbreak in India (https://www.covid19india.org/state/WB)
and the Ministry of Health (http://https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Here we estimate the transmission co-efficient, recovery rate and disease related mortality based on data from the data sources: covid19india.org: Coronavirus Outbreak in India (https://www.covid19india.org/state/WB) on 25th May,2020.
3.5. Estimating epid
In epidemiology, it is a very basic problem to estimate how many new infections occurred during the onset of an epidemic by a single infected person. This
number is called the basic reproduction number and denoted by R0 . With a sufficient population an epidemic would spread if and only if R0 > 1. This marginal
property has a biological inspiration, and the mathematical theory of R0 is well
described in [48, 21, 47, 42]. As the total number of cases in West Bengal is relatively low, the state has seen a rise in R0 -1.51 in late April, 1.14 in early May,
1.34 till May 10 and 1.22 in May 15 to May 25 (Source: Data shared by Sitabhra
Sinha, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, via IndiaSpend)[55]. Now
with the mean R0 as 1.30, mean viremic period 37 days and normal death rate
0.00002 of West Bengal, we have estimated the recovery rate(τ ), disease related
death(γ) and transmission rate(η) on 25th May,2020. Also this model represents
virus transmission by a set of nonlinear differential equations (ODEs) that add a
transmission rate for the dynamics of individuals in compartments. These transmission rate models are used to define a basic reproductive rate R0 that represents
the number of infectious populations that may be infected by an infectious individual. Here for the fixed R0 and district wise different recovery and death rate,
we have obtained the district wise transmission rate (using the Theorem- 1), given
in Table-2.

3.6. Result analysis
In this network model by exploiting the above data we perform a comparative study in each of these nine cities (districts) of West Bengal. We explore the
disease dynamics during and after lock down (i.e. after unlocking) when people
start moving from one district to another and form a network for the spread of
the SARS-2 or COVID-19. Figures 4 to 21 present the time series plot for susceptible, infectious and recovered population during and after partial lock down
restrictions. Figures 22 and 23 compares the time taken by the infected populations of each district to reach to its peak level during partial lock-down and after
unlocking respectively. The numerical values are summarized in the Table-3.
It can be seen from all the figures that, most of the susceptible class individuals
have been entered into infected class after some days. It also shows that most
people are recovering after reaching the saturation level of the infected class.

4. Discussion
Here we have used SIR-network Predictive model in two circumstances, during and after partial lock-down, to generate dynamical predictions and help inform
the debate as to easing lock-down measures. Just like any other model, our model
also suffers from deviations in accuracy in predicting the spread and peak of the
outbreak. These deviations can be attributed to factors like alternative release situations and such other border conditions. None the less we have provided the
model scenarios that can serve as guidelines in the fight against the COVID-19
pandemic. Furthermore, in unlocking the populations newer spread patterns of
SARS-COV-2 will be observed. So focus in this work is on dynamic modeling of
this pandemic so that we can fit in most of future lock-down scenarios in mathematically cautious fashion and as such we have formulated our model in such a
way that at the same time as having isolated parameters it is complex enough to
capture a wide range of options. Each other parameters relate either to the level of
infection or to the types and variety of situations that prevailed before a lock-down
is affected. In order to deal with the inadequacies of the knowledge of COVID-19
we have brought some changes in the basic parameters so that an optimal strategy
can effectively be handled. Graphical analysis shows that amongst the nine districts included in this study, the dynamics of COVID-19 infection patterns cannot
be generalized. In all districts more or less the peak is reached earlier than the
lock-down situation. Except in the capital city Kolkata where the peak is reached
much lesser time. This can be explained in the fact that migration happens from
the districts to Kolkata and not vice-versa raising the number of incumbent population in the city and hence raising the number of infections. In the other districts
also the results are varied. In West Midnapore and Hoogly for example the peak is
reached much earlier in a partial lock-down situation that is an unlocked situation
due to the high rate of infection. In East Midnapore the peak situation is more or
less same in all scenarios because of the high rate of travel whereas in Burdwan
and Nadia the peak is reached after a longer time than the other districts because
of high rate of recovery and low rate of infection. It is also observed that people
naturally tend to migrate from highly infected areas to low infection areas. We
can make one conclusion from here. In all the districts where the number of infected people is increasing after the introduction of full network resume, partial
network should be initiated on those contaminated zones and full network should
be imposed on the rest of the less infected areas.
It is generally observed that after the resumption of transportation the total
number of infections has fallen and as such our results indicate that the overall

situation can improve if the policy makers allow partial reopening of transport
networks in contentment areas while allowing full access to travel in the other
less affected areas. We also come to observe that in a densely populated country
like India the risk of infection will always be unavoidably high and the initial 90
days lock-down has already proven to be a setback for the economy not just India
but the entire world has suffered. Thus, with services and manufacturing breaking
down in several places and Global supply chains breaking down also. As an example, the work from home scenario in India has hit hard the transporters all round
the country and whatever little is available is actually exorbitantly priced of those
commuters who are compelled to travel even in the pandemic. Aspiring students
mentally distort because of the postponing of their exams and the prospect for jobs
being rendered slightly uncertain not to mention the raising labor downsizing that
these youngsters are observing around them. With an effective vaccine being out
of which at the moment, it is difficult for the policy makers to find balance between saving, the economy and saving lives from COVID-19 and puts additional
pressure on health care and every other human enterprise. In our work, we are
trying to tackle this dilemma by considering both the partial lock-down and the
unlock models and we have the following assumptions and observations.
• The coefficient of transmission has been fixed in the calculation. However,
it is hard to retain it when unlock leads to migration, so that in order to
accommodate this scenario, social distancing has to be maintained everywhere.
• In the absence of both a readily available COVID-19 vaccine and adequate
centralized medical facilities available for everybody, medicine must be administered locally, including in home isolation, so that treatment may be
meted out to all affected, as such potable medical units and instruments
must be accrued. This can be arranged during any of the subsequent lockdown periods when the stress of handling large number of patients is low.
• If after gathering enough medical facilities for both centralized and localized treatments the general population is allowed to lead a normal life, the
increase number of infections will make it to the peak point of the pandemic in India after which the number of cases is going to start to drop. To
be specific our study shows that from the time of unlocking the number of
infections will start to drop after 4 months.
• When we started to study the results after the simplification of the lockdown system, we observe that recovery rate is one of the most important

parameters in understanding post infection peaks. Similarly, specific studies can also be undertaken with other sensitive parameters like infection
rates. As the values are analyzed and understood more and more the trustworthiness of our calculation will go on increasing.
Due to complexity of COVID-19 transmissions, the spread of asymptomatic
cases has always been a point of concern. As routine rapid testing is impossible
to perform in India due to its population or even if it is planned to do so then also
it might take approximately 29 years to complete the process. Most of the tests
are being performed here for those who possess basic symptoms and those who
have come in contact with them. Thus a number of asymptomatic patients are
also being identified but that number is very low. This is because the simulated
data in the case of analyzing the situations is quite large as compared to real time
scenario. The model would be more realistic if the infected population could be
divided into several compartments but in that case again there is a problem of data
availability for India. From the discussion it is very clear that the SIR-network
model is a perfect set of work to be carried out in case of analyzing SARS CoV 2
in India for statistical evaluation of COVID-19 infected population by taking both
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases together.
Finally we have validated the model with data from July 21,2020 and the results are given in Appendix. We have found that it took almost the same time to
reach the saturation level of the infected people of the every district of our model.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, we can say that as we have evidence from Fig. 4 to Fig. 21,
an extended lock-down does not bid well for the economy at all and the indicators also show that extended lock-down does not lower the risk of infection or
reinfection. However, extended lock-down will definitely go towards hampering
the economy to a large extent and this effect can be neutralized by a period of
unlocking. This period of unlocking will help not only in reviving the economy,
but it will also help to reach the saturation point of the pandemic in West Bengal
in particular or India in general sooner than in the lock-down scenario. That is to
say the indicators in the lock-down scenario when analyzed speak of a saturation
point which is more uncertain and lengthier than the saturation point visible under
unlocking conditions. Now here we must say that if a vaccine is invented or if we
are to use a life saving setup like a ventilator, situations will vary. However, in
case of lengthy infections that is infections, which last a long time use of ventilators may not be that advisable because ventilators may in some case aid in the

collapsing of the lungs rather than reviving the patient. This happens in case of
poor compatibility under ventilated conditions in the lungs. So, since ventilators
are a very common tool in fighting the Corona virus infection. It is advisable that
some intelligent algorithms to be used while using the ventilator that taking to
account factors like FRC of the patient compatibility of the patient’s lungs with
respect to the ventilator that has been used and so on. At present we should use
stochastic modelling to better understand beyond the set of the second web of infections regarding our sample population. However, our SIR model that we have
used can easily be adopted to determine the time frame up to the second wave of
transmission in the probability setting for better evaluation.
Our model is broad enough to allow it to be applied in countries outside the
India or the province West Bengal, starting only with alternative initial conditions
and setting certain parameters that specify the country. This must be supported by
an agreed uniform definition of our basic model parameters and a case confirmation definition to ensure that the model validity is consistent with the concerned
country. In the present situation stochastic frameworks might be more suitable for
modelling the exact time period when the population resumes, so the scope of the
time frame up to the second wave of transmission in the probability setting can be
better evaluated.

Figure A.40: Susceptible (S9 ) class, Infected (I9 ) class and Recovered (R9 ) class people of
Burdwan(n8 ) for intra-connected network. During the partial lock-down, the infected population will reach at its peak of an amount of 1,60,000 infected person in 27 days and will go below
the initial infected in 66 days

Figure A.41: Susceptible (S9 ) class, Infected (I9 ) class and Recovered (R9 ) class people of
Burdwan(n8 ) for fully connected network. After the unlocking, within 69 days, the infected population will reach to its peak value at an amount 2,28,800 persons and down the initial amount of
infection in 76 days.
