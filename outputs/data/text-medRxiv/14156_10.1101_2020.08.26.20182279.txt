Abstract

2

COVID-19 poses a major challenge to care homes, as SARS-CoV-2 is readily transmitted and causes

3

disproportionately severe disease in older people. Here, 1,167 residents from 337 care homes were

4

identified from a dataset of 6,600 COVID-19 cases from the East of England. Older age and being a

5

care home resident were associated with increased mortality. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available

6

for 700 residents from 292 care homes. By integrating genomic and temporal data, 409 viral clusters

7

within the 292 homes were identified, indicating two different patterns - outbreaks among care

8

home residents and independent introductions with limited onward transmission. Approximately

9

70% of residents in the genomic analysis were admitted to hospital during the study, providing

Introduction

2

Care homes are at high risk of experiencing outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is associated with

3

higher

4

respiratory disease (Williamson et al., 2020), making the care home population especially vulnerable.

5

As of week ending 30th June 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) Office for National Statistics (ONS)

6

estimated that 30.2% of all deaths due to COVID-19 (13,417 deaths) in England occurred in care

7

homes, and 63.9% (28,390 deaths) occurred in hospital (ONS, 2020a). Most of the COVID-19 deaths

8

in hospital were in persons aged 65 years and over (86.1%). Deaths due to confirmed COVID-19 from

9

this period may be underestimates due to limitations on diagnostic testing; the ONS estimates that

10

from 28 December 2019 to 12 June 2020, there were 29,393 excess deaths in care homes compared

11

to

12

recorded COVID-19 (ONS, 2020b). To date, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in care homes has not been

Care homes are defined by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the independent regulator of adult

16

health and social care in England, as “places where personal care and accommodation are provided

17

together” (CQC, 2020a). In 2011, 291,000 people aged 65 or older were living in care homes in

18

England and Wales, representing 3.2% of the total population at this age; 82.5% of the care home

19

population was aged 65 years or older (ONS, 2014). Care homes are known to be high risk settings

20

for infectious diseases, owing to a combination of the underlying vulnerability of residents who are

21

often frail and elderly with multiple comorbidities, the shared living environment with multiple

22

communal spaces, and the high number of interpersonal contacts between residents, staff and

23

visitors

24

Understanding the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 within care homes is therefore an urgent

Rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis has been used to

trace viral transmission networks in hospital and community-based healthcare settings (Meredith et

29

al., 2020). This study was based in Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH), a secondary care provider

30

and tertiary referral centre in the East of England, UK. The study focused on identifying hospital-

31

acquired and healthcare-associated infections by integrating genomic and epidemiological data with

32

potentially hospital-acquired infections. Previous epidemiological studies of COVID-19 specifically in

2

care homes have been limited in population size, temporal scale and/or the amount of genomic data

3

included (Arons et al., 2020; Burton et al., 2020; Graham et al., 2020; Kemenesi et al., 2020; Quicke

4

et al., 2020). Here, genomic epidemiology is used to investigate viral transmission dynamics in care

5

home residents across the East of England (EoE), the fourth largest of the nine official regions in

6

England (Office for National Statistics, 2011). Several key questions of public health concern are

7

addressed: What is the burden of care home-associated COVID-19 tested in the region? What are

8

the outcomes for care home residents admitted to hospital with COVID-19? Does SARS-CoV-2 spread

9

between care home residents from the same care home via a single introduction and subsequent

10

transmission, or through multiple independent acquisitions of the virus among residents? Finally, is

11

there evidence of viral transmission between care homes and hospitals?

The epidemic curve for all cases tested at the Cambridge CMPHL peaked in the end of March and

8

early April (Figure 3). Care home residents comprised a greater proportion of cases in late April and

9

May than in March (Figure 3A, Table 2).

This may reflect the changing profile of samples submitted

10

to the CMPHL, as more regional hospitals had their own testing capacity and a greater number of

11

samples were submitted from community testing organisations in later weeks. However, a similar

12

trend was observed for patients tested at Cambridge University Hospitals, with the proportion of

13

community-onset care home-associated cases increasing from <5% in March to a peak of 14/49

14

(28.6%) in mid-April (Figure 3B, Table 3). This may suggest that transmission involving care home

15

residents took longer to decline following national lockdown (implemented on 23

16

the UK) than transmission in the non-care home general community.

care home residents (Table 1, Figure 3B), of which <7% were admitted to the intensive care unit

residency, ICU admission, and lower diagnostic cycle threshold (Ct) values were associated with

increased odds of mortality at 30 days from diagnosis (Figure 4, Table 4). The odds of mortality

period in both care home residents and non-care home residents (Figure 5, Table 5), consistent with

European trends (Alm et al., 2020). With ongoing viral evolution, descendent lineages of B.1 and

B.1.1 also rose in frequency and were commonly found in England during the relevant time period.

This suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in care homes were similar to those found

across the EoE outside of care homes. Consistent with this, care home and non-care home samples

Links between care homes and hospitals

Links between care homes and hospitals were investigated for the 700 care home residents with

15

genomic data available. 694 / 700 (99%) of the care home residents with genomic data had NHS

16

numbers available, which were linked to national hospital admissions data (Methods) (Table 7). 470

17

/ 694 (67.7%) care home residents had at least one hospital admission within the study period, and

18

398 / 694 (57.3%) were deemed to have been admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (i.e. their first

19

positive sample was taken within 2 days prior to admission up to 7 days post-admission). 40 / 694

20

(5.8%) cases were categorised as suspected hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections, defined as first

21

positive test being 7 days or more after their hospital admission date and prior to their discharge

22

date (N=13) or within 7 days following their hospital discharge (N=27) (Table 7). 230 / 694 (33.1%)

23

individuals were discharged from hospital within 7 days of their first positive test, and thus could

24

potentially have been infectious at the time of hospital discharge (Byrne et al., 2020).

includes care home residents, a carer from that same care home and another from an unknown care

Discussion

22

The genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in care homes in the East of England was investigated.

23

Care home residents comprised a large fraction of COVID-19 diagnoses in the “first wave” of the

24

pandemic in this region: up to a quarter of patients in the peak weeks of late March and early April

25

tested at CUH were

26

correlated with each other and were both associated with significantly increased odds of mortality

27

within 30 days of diagnosis. Care home residents thus bore a high burden of COVID-19 infections and

28

mortality.

NICE, 2020). Of note, non-invasive respiratory support (such as continuous positive airway pressure,

2

high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation) are routinely provided outside ICU in

3

many UK centres. Despite care home residents being at higher risk of severe COVID-19, and being

4

under-represented in ICU, admission to ICU was still correlated with significantly increased mortality.

5

This is likely because patients admitted to ICU have more severe disease, typically requiring more

6

intensive treatments such as organ support.

7
8

Viral clusters were defined within each care home by integrating temporal and genetic differences

9

between cases. This provides a “high resolution” picture of viral transmission; without genomic data,

10

separate introductions of the virus occurring around the same time are impossible to distinguish.

11

Care homes frequently experienced “outbreaks” of multiple cases within clusters (the largest of

12

which had >10 residents), consistent with substantial person-to-person transmission taking place

13

within care homes. Care homes also frequently had multiple distinct clusters (up to 4), consistent

14

with independent acquisitions of COVID-19 among residents – however, a single dominant cluster

15

usually

16

residents in the genomic analysis did not acquire COVID-19 in hospital. In the context of a national

17

lockdown,

18

frequency of care home outbreaks may reflect the underlying vulnerability of this population to

19

COVID-19 and the challenges of infection control in care homes. In contrast, the UK as a whole had

20

an average of 2.37 people per household in 2019 (ONS, 2019a) and in the East region only 2.2% of

21

households were made up of two or more unrelated adults (6.2% in London) (ONS, 2019b).

These findings emphasise the importance of limiting viral transmission within care homes in order to

There are several limitations to this study. First, not all of the COVID-19 cases from the East of

17

people aged 65 and older in England had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by early June, the majority

18

of whom were asymptomatic (UK government, 2020c). The Cambridge CMPHL did not receive all of

1

“missing links” within a cluster (the threshold used assumed a >15% probability of infections being

2

linked within <2 intermediate hosts), reducing the impact of missing care home cases on defined

3

clusters. The changing profile of COVID-19 testing in the UK between March and May 2020 should

4

therefore be factored into all interpretations of COVID-19 epidemiology from that period.

5
6

Third, defining who is a care home resident from large electronic healthcare records is challenging

7

and, despite substantial efforts (described in Methods), some care home residents may have been

8

missed. Using pre-defined coding such as care home CQC registration numbers when patients are

9

booked into hospital systems, rather than free-text data entry, would help considerably with care

10

home surveillance. Multiple rounds of electronic searches and manual inspection were undertaken

11

to identify as many care home residents as possible, and every care home resident included was

12

cross-referenced against a CQC database of registered care homes in England. The care homes

13

included for analysis should therefore be accurate.

14
15

Fourth, low viral sequence diversity limits the power of genomics to infer transmission clusters.

16

Between-care home transmission was not investigated specifically because, unlike within-care home

17

cases, opportunities for transfer of SARS-CoV-2 between care homes cannot be assumed or inferred

18

from the data. This could be assessed in a dedicated prospective study gathering epidemiological

19

data on between-care home contacts. Even within care homes, it is possible some genetically similar

20

viruses are from unconnected introduction events. However, incorporating genomic data is more

21

accurate for excluding linked transmission than if only temporal data are available. Genomics can

22

thus be used to “rule out” cases as being part of a linked cluster if the genetic difference is greater

23

than would be expected given the viral mutation rate. This could be practically informative for care

24

homes (along with other organisations at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks like factories (Middleton et al.,

2020)),

In conclusion, care homes represent a major burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, with

transmission events introducing SARS-CoV-2 into care homes and subsequent transmission within

32

them. Genomic data can be used in outbreak investigations to define viral clusters; this is critically

The UK government launched a national care home testing portal on 11

20

caring for people aged 65 years or older. Ending the study on 10

21

may be introduced by uneven systematic screening, for example when comparing the population

22

genetics of care home and non-care home samples, if care homes undergo screening while non-care

23

home settings do not. During the study period the scope of testing in hospital, community and care

24

home settings changed several times, as eligibility criteria were modified (Figure 1, supplement 1).

When interpreting trends in COVID-19 cases in the UK during this period it is essential to consider

the changing capacity and policies surrounding testing.

The file “CQC care directory – with filters (1 June 2020)” was accessed on 23

“Carehome?” column filtered to “Y”: N = 15,507*

-

Only care homes for which the “Location Postal Code” column matched at least 1 postcode

15
16

rd

from the dataset of 6,600 patients were included, yielding N = 444 care homes.**

-

17

Following manual review and consistifying postcodes with the sample metadata, a set of 469

CQC registered care homes were included.***

18
19

*Filtering using the “carehome?” column was based on advice given after correspondence with the

20

CQC.

21

** Requiring CQC registered care homes to match postcodes from the patient dataset minimised the

22

number of “false positives” – patients whose address name matched a CQC registered care home

23

name by coincidence.

24

*** 25 CQC registered care homes were added following manual review of the identified putative

25

care home residents, who had a different postcode documented in the electronic healthcare records

26

for the same care home, yielding the final “CQC EoE care home search set” of 469 care homes.

27
28

We then used the values from the “Location name” column of the filtered CQC dataset (i.e. the care

29

home facility names) as search phrases for address line 1 in the patient database. Any patients with

30

exactly matching phrases were labelled as care home residents. This increased the number of care

31

home residents identified by a further 382 to 1,147, i.e. around one third of care home residents

32

were identified using CQC facility names and would have been missed by relying on generic care

33

home-related search phrases alone.

Step 3: Manual inspection and data clean up

2

Address lines for the non-care home patients were manually inspected; this identified a further 89

3

care home residents. Most of these had not been detected in steps 1 and 2 due to spelling or

4

formatting issues with the patient addresses (e.g. short-hand abbreviations used for care home

5

names, or inclusion of extra details like flat number meaning the string did not match a CQC care

6

home name exactly).

7
8

Next, address lines for the care home residents were manually inspected and 14 were deemed not

9

to be care home residents. Most of these were due to unrelated locations sharing the same address

10

name as a CQC registered care home. The manual filtering steps thus yielded a care home resident

11

count of 1,147 + 89 – 14 = 1,222. Address line 1 for all 1,222 care home residents was manually

12

inspected and formatted to ensure residents from the same care home had matching terms in this

13

column. This was necessary due to discrepant address entrance formats for identical care homes;

14

without this step, residents from the same care home would be incorrectly assigned to different

15

anonymised care home codes.

16
17

Step 4: Linking care home addresses to CQC registered care homes

18

First line of patient address and postcodes were matched to care home names and postcodes from

19

the CQC EoE care home search set (described above). Any discrepancies (care homes not matching

20

the CQC data) were manually inspected and in the majority of cases the discrepancy could be

21

reconciled (e.g. alternative name or postcode used for the same care home). In 55 cases a “care

22

home” was reclassified to non-care home, either because the address was independent housing with

23

3

Linking care home data to CUH acute medical testing data

4

The dataset of 7,407 PCR-positive samples with metadata were collected prospectively as part of the

5

COG-UK study in Cambridge. Data on CUH acute care testing, including categorisations of whether

6

infections were community- or hospital-acquired (definitions provided in (Meredith et al., 2020)) and

7

data on patient outcomes (mortality at 30 days and ICU admissions), were collected separately as

8

part of CUH and national monitoring. During the study period, 464 patients tested positive for

9

COVID-19 at CUH.

10
11

When merging the metadata collected for COG-UK (including the above care home categorisations)

12

with CUH acute testing data, 71 care home residents tested at CUH were identified. However, there

13

were 23 samples that had tested positive in CUH that were not in the COG-UK dataset. 21/23 of

14

these were tested on the SAMBA platform at CUH (Collier et al., 2020), which is not PCR-based;

different clustering outcomes, if two cases were counted as further apart temporally than they really

17

were from the date of first positive swab. To ensure this had not biased our findings, the

18

analysis was re-run with identical thresholds using the date of first positive test for each individual

Hospital admission coding included transfer of care between medical units as separate admissions.

2

These were condensed into single admissions if the time interval between the preceding discharge

3

and the following admission was less than or equal to 1 day. i.e. an admission had to occur 2 days or

4

more after the preceding discharge to be counted as a new admission.

5

Hospital admission data were parsed to yield the following outputs:

6

•

7
8

COVID-19 related hospital admission: first positive test date was -2 to +7 days inclusive from

a hospital admission date

•

Suspected hospital acquired: first positive test date was +7 days from a hospital admission to

9

+7 days from a hospital discharge, inclusive. The people testing positive in the community

10

within 7 days of discharge from hospital are categorised as, “community onset, suspected

11

hospital acquired”; the people testing positive after 7 days from admission but before their

12

discharge are categorised as, “hospital onset, suspected hospital acquired”.

13
14

•

For the 6 individuals with no NHS number, we assumed they were not discharged within 7

days of a positive test.

15

For the care home

16

number of days the patient had been admitted to hospital prior to their positive test was calculated.

CUH HCW-Care home resident cluster analysis

18

The analysis of transmission between healthcare workers (HCW) and care home residents focused

19

on CUH cases, where the richest metadata was available including HCW status.

20
21

Of 6,600 PCR-positive patients, 91 had been identified as HCW. 74 of these were from the CUH HCW

22

screening programme (which includes symptomatic, asymptomatic and household contact arms) (N.

23

K. Jones et al., 2020; Rivett et al., 2020) and 17 had presented acutely to CUH medical services, and

24

been identified as HCW during their initial medical clerking and subsequent note reviews. Of the 91

25

HCW, 76 had genomes available for analysis (breakdown: 56 samples identified through the CUH

26

HCW screening programme, 9 CUH HCW who presented to acute medical services at CUH, and 11

27

HCW from community settings (paramedics and care home workers) that had been flagged as HCW

28

through admission clerkings). Of 464 CUH cases in the study period, 72 were care home residents

29

(described above) and 54 of these had available genomes for analysis. The total combined analysis

30

set of CUH HCW and care home residents was therefore 76+54 = 130.

The 130 genomes were aligned using MAFFT and underwent the same cluster analysis using the

2

transcluster algorithm as described above. Transmission links between care homes were excluded as

3

were links between HCWs. HCWs could belong to multiple clusters from different care homes to

4

allow for the possibility of a HCW seeding multiple care home infections. 21 clusters involving both

5

care home residents and HCWs were identified. Of the 54 care home residents, 38 had links with

6

HCWs within the 0.15 probability threshold.

7

transmission pairs were reviewed by author WLH as described in (Meredith et al., 2020), with cases

8

being categorised as strongly linked epidemiologically (e.g. the HCW documented in the care home

9

residents’ medical notes); possibly linked (e.g. both working in the hospital at the same time but not

Ethics

12

This study was conducted as part of surveillance for COVID-19 infections under the auspices of

13

Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006. It therefore did not require individual patient consent or ethical

14

approval. The COG-UK study protocol was approved by the Public Health England Research Ethics

15

Governance Group (reference: R&D NR0195).

Flow diagram for identifying care homes from Cambridge-COGUK metadata

3

Steps for identifying care home residents (further details in Methods). First, the address field in the

4

patient electronic healthcare records was searched for matching terms indicating a care home (e.g.

5

“care home”, “nursing home”,

6

terms from a list of care home names registered to the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The resulting

7

list was manually inspected and every care home included in the study was linked to a registered

8

CQC care home. CQC coding of whether the care home had nursing care available was used (referred

9

to as “nursing homes” if nursing care was available and “residential homes” if not). If the address

10

information was incomplete (no postcode and/or no address line) then the case was excluded as

11

impossible to determine whether or not the patient was from a care home, unless the person was

12

known to be a healthcare worker (HCW), in which case it was assumed they were not a care home

13

resident. This process yielded the final result of 1,167 care home residents from 337 care homes;

5,246 individuals that were not care home residents, and 187 individuals that were indeterminable.

Of the 6,600 individuals in the study, 1,167 were identified as care home residents and 5,246 were

8

tree comprises all 700 care home and 3,745 non-care home genomes from the study (total 4,445

samples), rooted on a 2019 genome from Wuhan, China. As with Figure 6, the colour bar (right)

10

indicates whether samples were from care home residents (blue) or non-care home residents (grey).

11

Samples from the ten care homes with the largest number of genomes are highlighted by coloured

12

circles on branch tips. This supports the findings shown in Figure 6 using the randomly selected sub-

13

sample of non-care home samples, (1) that care home genomes were phylogenetically intermixed

14

with non-care home genomes (consistent with transmission between care homes and outside of

15

care homes), and (2) that, using the 10 care homes with the largest number of samples as examples,

16

some care homes were monophyletic (such as CARE0314) while others were polyphyletic (such as

17

CARE0061). Even for polyphyletic care homes (implying multiple independent introductions of the

18

virus among residents), the majority of samples were usually attributable to

2

care home is typically larger than the date range for clusters within care homes, except for single-

3

cluster care homes like CARE0314. This is consistent with the

of cases occurring closer together in time. While the care homes frequently had more than one

5

introduction of the virus among residents (i.e. >1 clusters), there was usually a single dominant

6

cluster responsible for the majority of cases. Individual counts of males and females for each care

7

home are not shown as this generally gave counts of less than five, risking patient anonymity.

Overall there were 59/102 (57.8%) females for these 10 care homes.

700/1,167 (60.0%) care home residents identified in the study had genomic data available and were

5

used to define care home SARS-CoV-2 clusters. We investigated the proportions of these care home

6

residents that were hospitalised and may have acquired their infections through interactions with

7

hospitals. This was possible for 694/700 (99.1%) individuals who had NHS numbers documented that

8

could be linked with national hospitalisation data. Being hospitalised due to COVOD-19 was defined

9

as the date of first positive sampling being within 2 days prior to admission up to 7 days post-

10

admission. Suspected hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections were defined as first positive test being

11

7 days or more after hospital admission date and prior to discharge date (N=13) or within 7 days

12

following hospital discharge (N=27). Of the latter group, 10 individuals were admitted to hospital

13

and discharged on the same day prior to their positive test, 9 were admitted for 1 to 7 days, and 8

14

had been admitted for greater than 7 days.
