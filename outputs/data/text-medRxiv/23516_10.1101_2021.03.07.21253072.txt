Key Points

Question: Which individuals are at greatest risk for post-acute sequelae of COVID-19?
Findings: In this non-probability internet survey, among 6,211 individuals with symptomatic
COVID-19 illness, 7.9% experienced persistence of symptoms lasting 2 months or longer.
Older age, but not other sociodemographic features, was associated with risk for
persistence, as was headache.
Meaning: Identifying individuals at greater risk for symptomatic persistence may facilitate
development of targeted interventions.

Abstract

Importance: COVID-19 symptoms are increasingly recognized to persist among a subset
of individual following acute infection, but features associated with this persistence are not
well-understood.
Objective: We aimed to identify individual features that predicted persistence of symptoms
over at least 2 months at the time of survey completion.
Design: Non-probability internet survey. Participants were asked to identify features of
acute illness as well as persistence of symptoms at time of study completion. We used
logistic regression models to examine association between sociodemographic and clinical
features and persistence of symptoms at or beyond 2 months.
Setting: Ten waves of a fifty-state survey between June 13, 2020 and January 13, 2021.
Participants: 6,211 individuals who reported symptomatic COVID-19 illness confirmed by
positive test or clinician diagnosis.
Exposure: symptomatic COVID-19 illness
Results: Among 6,211 survey respondents reporting COVID-19 illness, with a mean age of
37.8 (SD 12.2) years and 45.1% female, 73.9% white, 10.0% Black, 9.9% Hispanic, and
3.1% Asian, a total of 4946 (79.6%) had recovered within less than 2 months, while 491
(7.9%) experienced symptoms for 2 months or more. Of the full cohort, 3.4% were
symptomatic for 4 months or more and 2.2% for 6 months or more. In univariate analyses,
individuals with persistent symptoms on average reported greater initial severity. In logistic
regression models, older age was associated with greater risk of persistence (OR 1.10,
95% CI 1.01-1.19 for each decade beyond 40); otherwise, no significant associations with
persistence were identified for gender, race/ethnicity, or income. Presence of headache

was significantly associated with greater likelihood of persistence (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.111.86), while fever was associated with diminished likelihood of persistence (OR 0.66, 95%
CI 0.53-0.83).
Conclusion and Relevance: A subset of individuals experience persistent symptoms from
2 to more than 10 months after acute COVID-19 illness, particularly those who recall
headache and absence of fever. In light of this prevalence, strategies for predicting and
managing such sequelae are needed.

INTRODUCTION

Postviral syndromes following epidemics have been recognized for more than a century,
and COVID-19 appears to be no exception1. For a subset of individuals with acute
Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) disease, symptoms may persist beyond a month2, with some
patients reporting symptoms at least 6 months later. At 60 days after hospitalization, one
study found that 87% of individuals with COVID-19 had at least one persistent symptom3,
while at 6 months post-hospitalization, a large study found 63% of participants experienced
fatigue or weakness, and 26% experienced sleep disturbance 4. The prevalence of such
symptoms among less severely ill patients is less well-characterized; one app-based study
including non-hospitalized individuals found rates of persistence of 4.5% at 2 months5.

Numerous aspects of this symptom persistence, referred to as post-acute sequelae of
COVID-19, remain poorly understood, with a recent evidence review suggesting this
phenomenon may actually reflect multiple different syndromes(1). In particular, it is not
known which individuals will experience full recovery, and which persistence. A particular
concern is whether disadvantaged groups may be disproportionately impacted, as they
have been by acute infection7. On the other hand, if high-risk individuals could be identified,
it might be possible to develop strategies to mitigate or prevent symptom persistence,
prompting calls for increased emphasis on investigation of post-acute sequelae of COVID198.

In order to better characterize symptom persistence, we utilized data from a multi-wave US
survey that included questions about COVID-19 encompassing 50 states and the District of
Columbia. Importantly, the survey did not focus only on COVID-19, yielding less likelihood
of selection bias than more focused surveys of COVID-19 persistence where participants
opt in. We aimed to identify individual features that predicted persistence of symptoms over
at least 2 months at the time of survey completion.

METHOD

Study Design

We conducted 10 waves of an online survey between June 13, 2020 and January 10, 2021
across 50 states and the District of Columbia, applying nonprobability sampling using
representative quotas in order to balance age, gender, and race/ethnicity. These waves
included a total of 124962 non-overlapping individuals. The study was determined to be
exempt by the Institutional Review Board of Harvard University; all participants signed
consent online prior to survey access.

Measures

All respondents were asked if they had received a positive COVID-19 test result, and/or
had received a diagnosis of likely COVID-19 by a clinician. Those who endorsed either of
these completed a checklist to identify symptoms present during initial illness, and those

who endorsed persistent symptoms at the time of survey completion completed a second
checklist with an expanded list of symptoms. The full survey is available at [link]1.

Analysis

In primary analysis, we examined all individuals with either a positive test or clinician
diagnosis of COVID-19 at any point, consistent with an evidence review indicating a high
proportion of individuals lacked access to testing earlier in the pandemic6; sensitivity
analyses planned a priori examined a narrower definition based on a positive test alone.
Individual symptoms were characterized in terms of prevalence at acute infection, and then
among those with persistent symptoms. Duration of illness in months was estimated based
on date of survey completion and reported month of initial illness and subsequent months
reported to be symptomatic. (Individuals who remained symptomatic at time of survey
completion, with symptom duration of less than 2 months, were excluded from analysis of
persistence). We utilized logistic regression in R 4.09 to examine association of symptoms
during acute infection with risk for persistence, adjusted for age in decade, gender,
race/ethnicity indicated on a 5-item questionnaire, income decile, and rural/suburban/urban
area of residence, as well as self-reported severity of initial illness on a 4-point scale (â€˜not
at allâ€™, â€˜not tooâ€™, â€˜somewhatâ€™, or â€˜veryâ€™ severe).

The full cohort included 6,211 individuals who reported symptomatic COVID-19 illness
confirmed by positive test or clinician diagnosis (Table 1), with a mean age of 37.8 (SD
12.2) years, who were 45.1% female, 73.9% white, 10.0% Black, 9.9% Hispanic, and 3.1%
Asian. Among them, a total of 4946 (79.6%) had recovered within less than 2 months, while
491 (7.9%) experienced symptoms for 2 months or more, and 774 (12.5%) were not yet
recovered but had been ill for less than 2 months. Of the full cohort, 3.4% were
symptomatic for 4 months or more and 2.2% for 6 months or more. Figure 1 illustrates time
to recovery, right-censoring individuals still ill at month of survey.

We next examined features associated with persistent symptoms (eTable 1). In univariate
analyses, individuals with persistent symptoms on average reported greater initial severity,
greater likelihood of confirmation of diagnosis by a clinician, and greater prevalence of all
individual symptoms except fever (Table 1).

In multiple logistic regression (Figure 1), age was associated with greater risk (for
each decade beyond age 40, OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.20). Otherwise, no significant
associations with persistence were identified among sociodemographic features including
gender, race/ethnicity, and income decile. Among individual symptoms during acute illness,
headache was significantly associated with greater likelihood of persistence (Figure 2),
while fever was associated with diminished likelihood of persistence. In addition, greater
overall self-reported severity during acute illness was also associated with likelihood of
persistence.

In sensitivity analysis, we further restricted the cohort to those with a positive COVID test
result (n=4438). In this group, 332 (7.5%) experienced persistence (including 3.3% for at
least 4 months and 2.2% for at least 6 months). Repeating contrasts restricting to these
groups yielded similar results (see eTable 2 and eFigure 1); in particular, while no
significant differences in sociodemographic features were identified, magnitude of
association for headache (95% CI 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.94) and fever (OR 0.72, 95% CI
0.54-0.95) were similar to that observed in the full cohort.

DISCUSSION

Across 10 survey waves encompassing 6,211 individuals with COVID-19 illness confirmed
by test and/or clinical evaluation, 7.9% experienced persistent symptoms for at least 2
months, and as many as 10 months. Prevalence of persistent symptoms was generally
similar across sociodemographic groups, but characteristics of acute illness â€“ in particular,
more severe illness and presence of headache -- were associated with greater probability
of persistence.

Our results are difficult to compare directly to prior reports. In the largest study to date, at 6month follow-up, more than half of the cohort experienced persistent symptoms, with
fatigue or muscle weakness seen most commonly4(p19). Far less is known about less
severely ill individuals. A study using app-based symptom recording in 4182 cases of
COVID-19 only 4.5% reported symptoms for more than 8 weeks, broadly similar to our
results â€“ as in the inpatient cohorts, fatigue was among the most common symptoms5,

along with dyspnea and headache. In general, these two studies using very different
methodologies and ascertainment methods support the hypothesis that probability of
persistent symptoms is likely to correlate with severity of acute illness.

While we identified only a modest magnitude of association with older age, our results may
still help to guide risk stratification if confirmed in additional cohorts. Most notably, clinical
presentation may point toward those with greater likelihood of experiencing prolonged
symptoms, namely greater severity during initial illness, presence of headache, and
absence of fever.

Multiple caveats must be considered in interpreting our findings. First, as the study used
pre-empaneled respondents in a non-probability design, we cannot reliably calculate
response rate; as such, non-response bias cannot be estimated. However, we note that in
other domains these non-probability surveys have closely mirrored results with more
traditional designs10. Furthermore, our cross-sectional design does not allow more precise
estimate of symptom persistence, and relies on participant recall in some cases nearly a
year after initial illness. Still, this misclassification should bias our results toward smaller
estimates of effect, such that any associations we identify may actually represent
conservative estimates. For a subset of participants, we also cannot correctly classify their
status, as follow-up is insufficient to allow determination of persistence; we report the
features of this group, and include survival curves for time to remit, rather than simply
excluding them from all analyses. Finally, and most notably, we rely on self-report of
symptoms. Here too, this limitation contributes to misclassification, particularly of

individuals who may be predisposed to less reliable reporting of symptoms for any reason.
As a result, prospective studies will be necessary to confirm our results.

Despite these limitations, we also emphasize the strengths of this systematic assessment,
namely that by design it should be more representative than other single-cohort studies
because it captures individuals drawn from every state. Moreover, because the survey is
not specifically aimed at individuals with COVID-19 or symptom persistence, it may be less
biased toward those with a greater interest in long-term symptoms than (for example)
symptom tracking applications5. We underscore this point: as recruitment materials did not
specify COVID-19 or persistence, our results are less likely to reflect individuals with
greater interest in COVID-19 persistence.

In aggregate, our results provide further support for the observation that a subset of
individuals may experience persistence of COVID-19 symptoms for many months beyond
initial infection, providing estimates of prevalence that complement those from hospitalbased cohorts or patient surveys. Notably, persistent symptoms are not strongly associated
with any individual sociodemographic group; however, individual symptoms and greater
overall acuity identify individuals at greater risk for persistence. If confirmed in prospective
studies, these results may facilitate risk stratification, with a goal of early intervention to
minimize the impact of such Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, and potentially efforts to
prevent them.
