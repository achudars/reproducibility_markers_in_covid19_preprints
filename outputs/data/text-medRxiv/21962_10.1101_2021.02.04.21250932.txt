Abstract

45

Background

46

In order to manage the COVID-19 systemic inflammatory response, it is important to identify

47

clinicopathological characteristics across multiple cohorts.

48
49

Methods

50

Electronic patient records for 2 consecutive cohorts of patients admitted to two urban

51

teaching hospitals with COVID-19 during two 7-week periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in

52

Glasgow, U.K. (cohort 1: 17th March 2020 - 1st May 2020) and (cohort 2: 18th May 2020 – 6th

53

July 2020) were examined for routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data.

54
55

Results

56

Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to be female (p<0.05)

57

and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). More patients in cohort 2 were

58

PCR positive, CXR negative (both p<0.001) and had low serum albumin concentrations

59

(p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between both cohorts (23% and 22%). Over the 2

60

cohorts, age >70 (p<0.001), male gender (p<0.05), hypertension (p<0.01), heart failure

61

(p<0.05), cognitive impairment (p<0.001), frailty (p<0.001), COPD (p<0.05), delirium

62

(p<0.001), elevated perioperative Glasgow Prognostic Score (p<0.001), elevated neutrophil-

63

lymphocyte ratio (p<0.001), low haematocrit (p<0.01), elevated urea (p<0.001), creatinine

64

(p<0.001), glucose (p<0.05) and lactate (p<0.01); and the 4C score were associated with 30-

65

day mortality. When compared with the 4C score, greater frailty (OR 10.2, 95% C.I. 3.4 –

66

30.6, p<0.01) and low albumin (OR 5.6, 95% C.I. 2.0 – 15.6, p<0.01) were strongly

67

independently associated with 30-day mortality.

Conclusion

70

In addition to the 4C mortality score, frailty score and a low albumin were strongly

71

independently associated with 30-day mortality in two consecutive cohorts of patients

72

admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Article summary

75

•

In two consecutive cohorts of patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to two

76

urban teaching hospitals in Glasgow, UK, there were variations in a number of

77

clinicopathological characteristics despite similar mortality (23 and 22%).

78

•

In these two cohorts, in a multivariate analysis that included the 4C mortality score,

79

clinical frailty score >3, low serum albumin concentration (<35 g/L), high neutrophil-

80

lymphocyte ratio (>5), and abnormal serum sodium concentration (<133/>145

81

mmol/L) remained independently associated with 30-day mortality.

92

Background

93

The number of people worldwide who are known to have been infected with COVID-19

94

(SARS-CoV-2 infection) increased from 30 million to 84 million in a twelve week period

95

between September 2020 and January 2021, and the number who have died has almost

96

doubled (1 million to 1.8 million) (1). The severity of this viral disease for an individual is

97

associated with a widespread perturbation of immune, physiological and metabolic

98

parameters (2, 3). These whole-body changes are characteristic of a systemic inflammatory

99

response to tissue injury. Indeed, measures of this systemic inflammatory response have been

100

shown to have prognostic value (4-6). In particular, the 4C mortality score was developed in

101

more than 55,000 patients with COVID-19 and measured the systemic inflammatory

102

response using C-reactive protein (6). Other measures of the systemic inflammatory response

103

such as the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have also been shown to have prognostic

104

value (7). Moreover, the systemic inflammatory response has been shown to be a useful

105

therapeutic target in patients with COVID-19 (8-10). However, to date, as there have been

106

variations in the assessment of the systemic inflammatory response, other important factors

107

may remain to be identified. Experience in consecutive cohorts also remains limited.

108
109

The aim of the present study was to compare the 4C mortality score, other measures of the

110

systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in two consecutive

111

cohorts of patients on admission with COVID-19.

Patients and methods

116

Electronic patient records for patients who were admitted to two large city teaching

117

hospitals (Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital

118

(QEUH), Glasgow, U.K.), for two consecutive cohorts, cohort 1 (n=243, 1/4/2020-

119

18/5/2020) (5) and cohort 2 (n=261, 18/5/2020-6/7/2020) were examined for

120

routine clinical, laboratory and clinical outcome data. These teaching hospitals serve

121

urban populations with a high burden of socio-economic deprivation and offer the full

122

spectrum of adult acute receiving specialties to patients over 16 years old. In line with

123

NHS policy, the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Caldicott guardian approved this study.

124

The study protocol (GN20AE307) was approved by the North West England – Preston

125

research ethics committee (20/NW/0336) and registered with clinicaltrials.gov

126

(NCT04484545).

127
128

Details of the recruitment of patients between 1/4/2020-18/5/2020 for cohort 1 have

129

been previously described (5). In patients admitted to hospital between 18/5/2020-

130

6/7/2020, age, sex, BMI and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed evidence of

131

COVID-19 infection at time of discharge or death certification were considered minimal

132

criteria for inclusion in cohort 2.

133
134

As per routine clinical practice in the Emergency Department (ED) and Acute Assessment

135

Unit (AAU) in both hospitals, patients were scored on the National Early Warning Score

136

(NEWS) at presentation to triage. NEWS is a validated score of severity of physiological

137

derangement that allocates a score (0–3) to six clinical parameters (pulse rate, blood pressure,

138

respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, requirement for supplemental oxygen and level of

139

responsiveness (alert (A), responding to verbal (V), painful (P) stimuli and unresponsive (U)

AVPU scale)) (11). NEWS determines the triage category and level of immediate treatment

141

that is required at the time of presentation, and the interval to re-administering the NEWS

142

scoring tool according to the score achieved (i.e. the severity of physiological derangement).

143

NEWS >4 and >7 are considered to indicate moderately severe and severe physiological

144

derangement respectively.

145
146

The 4C Mortality Score is a validated prognostic score that predicts in-hospital mortality

147

among patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to a general hospital setting in the U.K.

148

(6). It includes eight variables that are readily available at initial hospital assessment: age,

149

sex, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, level of

150

consciousness, urea level, and C-reactive protein (score range 0-21 points) (see Table 1).

Table 1 * Comorbidities were defined by using Charlson comorbidity index, with the

169

170
171

In the present study, age was grouped as less than 40 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69

172

years, 70-79 years and 80 years and older. Age categories were further simplified to </> 70

173

years. Social deprivation was defined by the Scottish Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2019

174

based on individual home postcode. Ethnicity was classified as White, Mixed, Asian, Black,

175

or other ethnic group.

176
177

Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) (12, 13). The CFS is a validated

178

measure of clinical frailty that has been shown to have prognostic value (13). The CFS

179

includes items such as comorbidity, cognitive impairment and disability while also

180

incorporating functional interpretation of physical frailty according to level of dependence in

181

living circumstances (12). In the present study, living circumstances were classified as:

182

independent; living at home with support from family member / paid carer or sheltered

183

accommodation; care home; or dependent living in a nursing home.

184

Admission serum C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin concentrations and differential blood

185

cell counts were categorised using local reference intervals. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio

186

(NLR) and the peri-operative Glasgow Prognostic Score (poGPS) were calculated as outlined

187

in Tables 2 and 3 (14-16). The NLR and poGPS are validated prognostic scoring systems that

188

have been used in a variety of clinical settings. They both utilise two components,

189

neutrophils/ lymphocytes and C-reactive protein/ albumin respectively, that are routinely

190

measured in patients admitted to the general hospital setting. For this study, each scoring

191

system had 3 divisions indicating mild, moderate and severe systemic inflammatory response

192

respectively (17).

Statistical Analysis

210

Demographical and clinicopathological data were presented as categorical variables using

211

recognised clinical thresholds. These variables were analysed using χ2 test for linear-by-linear

212

association, or χ2 test for 2-by-2 tables.

213

Associations between demographical, clinicopathological characteristics and mortality were

214

analysed using univariate and a multivariate backward conditional approach. A p < 0.05 was

215

applied to inclusion at each step in the multivariate analysis.

216

A convenience sampling strategy was adopted based on the patients admitted during the

217

study period; therefore, a formal sample size calculation was not performed. Missing data

218

were excluded from analysis on a variable-by-variable basis. Two-tailed p values <0.05 were

219

considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software

220

version 27.0. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

235

Details of the recruitment of patients for cohort 1 (n=243) have been previously described

236

(5). In cohort 2, of the 356 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection by

237

PCR test, 278 patients fulfilled the criteria for inclusion with age, sex, BMI. Seventeen

238

patients were re-admitted and these were excluded from the analysis at second admission

239

leaving 261 patients to be included in the analysis.

240
241

Comparison of the demographical and clinicopathological characteristics of the two cohorts

242

are shown in Table 4. Compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were older (p<0.001), more likely to

243

be female (p<0.05) and have less independent living circumstances (p<0.001). With reference

244

to previous medical history, compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 had hypertension and heart

245

failure (both p<0.05), had chronic renal failure (p<0.001), had cognitive impairment and

246

previous delirium (both p<0.01), were less frail (p<0.001) and had less asthma (p<0.01).

247

With reference to diagnostic criteria, compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 were more likely to be

248

PCR positive and CXR negative (both p<0.001).

249

compared with cohort 1, cohort 2 had low albumin (p<0.001), low haemoglobin (p<0.001),

250

low haematocrit (p<0.05), lower MCV (0.05), abnormal sodium (p<0.01), elevated creatinine

251

(p<0.01), elevated alkaline phosphatase (p<0.001). 30-day mortality was similar between the

252

cohorts (23% and 22%).

To determine which admission parameters were independently associated with 30-day

268

mortality, those factors identified in Table 5 as significant and not in the 4C mortality score

269

were also entered into a binary logistic regression analysis (Table 6). In this multivariate

270

analysis of a restricted dataset (due to limited lactate measurements), only greater frailty (OR

271

10.2, 95% C.I. 3.4 – 30.6, p<0.01), low albumin (OR 5.6, 95% C.I. 2.0 – 15.6, p<0.01), high

Discussion

2

The results of the present study show that, in 2 consecutive cohorts, there was a variation in

3

the admission demographic and clinicopathological characteristics. In particular, the latter

4

cohort were older, had more cardiovascular and renal disease and greater derangement of

5

their laboratory data. Despite this, 30-day mortality was similar between the cohorts. In both

6

cohorts the 4C score, which incorporates age, sex, comorbidity, respiratory, renal and brain

7

function and a measure of the activation of the systemic inflammatory response, had

8

prognostic value. In addition, when compared directly with the 4C mortality score a number

9

of other factors had independent prognostic value, in particular clinical frailty and a low

10

albumin. Taken together, the present results would suggest that the relationship between

11

clinicopathological factors and short-term mortality in patients with COVID-19 may vary

12

with time. Also, that there are other important factors in short term mortality of patients with

13

COVID-19, not captured by the 4C mortality score and such factors may improve the

14

prognostic value of the 4C score. Therefore, there is a need for further work to determine

15

independent prognostic value of clinicopathological factors in patients presenting with

16

COVID-19.

17
18

The basis of the strong prognostic value of the clinical frailty scale and low albumin,

19

independent of the 4C mortality score in these patients, is not clear. However, COVID-19

20

patients with a clinical frailty score >3 may be considered vulnerable and frail and this entity

21

(the ability to care for themselves and its relationship with mortality) may not be captured

22

directly by the 4C score. In particular, the present results may indicate that having COVID-

23

19 induced cytokine storm in a frail patient is a life threatening event (18). Similarly, with

24

reference to a low serum albumin concentration, a cytokine storm would increase the

25

likelihood of mortality. In the case of a low albumin it is clear that this may reflect both an

26

ongoing systemic inflammatory response and also poor nutritional status (19). It may be that

27

the strong prognostic value of frailty also reflects poor nutritional status since a systemic

28

inflammatory response occurring against a background of low metabolic reserves is likely to

29

lead to cellular and organ dysfunction. If this was the case, then it might be expected that

30

frail and hypoalbuminaemic patients would benefit most from treatment with anti-

31

inflammatory agents and nutritional supplementation. Therefore, it may be important to also

32

consider nutritional risk in patients with COVID-19. Irrespective, it would be important to

33

consider frailty and a low albumin in the assessment of patients with COVID-19 (20).

34
35

To date, in patients with COVID-19, there has been a great deal of focus on the virus itself.

36

However, it is clear from the prognostic value of host physiology and the host systemic

37

inflammatory response in the 4C work (6) and in the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment

38

(13) that host factors are of considerable importance in outcome of patients with COVID-19.

39

From the present results it is also clear that frailty and nutritional status are important

40

characteristics to be taken into the “staging” of patients presenting with COVID-19.

41
42

Limitations

43

The present study has a number of limitations. The sample size is relatively small and

44

therefore subject to limitations such as sample bias. However, the clinicopathological data

45

collected was comprehensive across two cohorts, included factors validated in large cohorts

46

of patients with COVID-19 and therefore allowed direct comparison of these factors.

Conclusion

52

In the two consecutive cohorts there were variations in a number of clinicopathological

53

characteristics despite similar mortality. In these two cohorts, in addition to the 4C mortality

54

score, NLR>3, abnormal serum sodium concentration (<133 / >146 mmol/L), clinical frailty

55

score >3 and low serum albumin concentration (<30 g/L) were independently associated with

56

30-day mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection.
