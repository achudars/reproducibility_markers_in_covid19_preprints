Abstract
We prospectively compared natural spring water gargle to combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab

(ONPS) for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in paired clinical specimens

(1005 ONPS and 1005 gargles) collected from 987 unique early symptomatic as well as

asymptomatic individuals from the community. Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex™

2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence

interval [CI], 90.2 to 98.3%) and was similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2

to 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher

cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA

was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days. The simplicity of this sampling

method coupled with the accessibility of spring water are clear advantages in a pandemic

situation where testing frequency, turnaround time and shortage of consumables and trained

staff are critical elements.

Introduction
Testing massively, rapidly and frequently has been considered one of the most important

measure to control the COVID-19 pandemic (

1, 2). Although nasopharyngeal swab has long been

considered the specimen of choice for the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections, including

SARS-CoV-2

infection,

it

suffers

from

several

drawbacks:

acceptability, and it is vulnerable to shortages in both specialized materials and trained

3

healthcare workers in the context of a pandemic ( ).

Saliva has been well studied and is now considered an acceptable alternative specimen for the

diagnosis of COVID-19 (

4, 5).

However, since direct SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (i.e. without prior RNA

extraction) has been used to accelerate turn-around time and to circumvent the problem of

extraction reagent shortages, saliva may be less suitable because it usually requires RNA

extraction or additional sample preparation, such as proteinase K treatment and dilution, before

PCR analysis ( ). Moreover, its viscosity can hamper laboratory automation ( ).

Swish and gargle with a mouth rinse has been less studied as a sample for COVID-19 diagnosis.

However, it is easier to obtain from individuals having difficulty producing saliva, and is also

easier to manipulate in the laboratory since the sample is already diluted, which effectively

reduces sample viscosity. One small study found gargle to be as sensitive as throat swab for the

8

detection of respiratory pathogens but did not compare it to nasopharyngeal swab ( ). Some

authors have used saline as a mouth rinse and gargle and found it to be at least as sensitive as

nasopharyngeal swab for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (

9-11),

but they proceeded to RNA

extraction as saline is less suitable for direct RT-PCR due to inhibition of some PCR assays by high

concentration of sodium chloride (

12).

Moreover, many medical grade supplies are prone to

shortages during a pandemic. These shortcomings of actual studies justified our evaluation of

the swish and gargle with natural spring water compared to combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab

(ONPS) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 using a direct RT-PCR method without RNA extraction.

Methods
Study subjects and specimen collection. Patients aged ≥ 6 years presenting to a drive-through
test center were included either if they had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or if they were

considered an asymptomatic close contact by public health services. Patients aged 5 years or

less were excluded because there are usually unable to gargle adequately. After obtaining

consent, an ONPS was first collected using a standardised method by a trained health care

professional. The flocked swab was first used to swab the posterior oropharynx and the tonsillar

arches, and then the same swab was inserted through one nostril parallel to palate until

resistance was met or the distance was equivalent to the distance from the patient’s ear to their

nostril, rotated several times and left in place for 5 – 10 seconds prior to being removed as per

Center for Disease Control instructions for collection (

13). The ONPS was placed in a conical 15

ml centrifuge tube containing 3 ml of molecular water (PCR grade water), which is a validated,

standard-of-care specimen transport medium for SARS-CoV-2 testing

(

12, 14).

Subjects were

then provided with 5 ml of natural spring water (Eska water, St-Mathieu-d’Harricana, Québec,

Canada or Naya water, Mirabel, Québec, Canada) in a disposable soft plastic cup (Plastic

Medicine Cups, AMG Medical, Montreal, Quebec, Canada) and instructed to rinse their mouth

for 5 seconds, tilt their head back and gargle for 5 seconds, repeat this cycle once, expel the

water back in the plastic cup and empty it in a 15 ml conical polypropylene centrifuge tube. Both

specimens were simultaneously submitted and processed for SARS-CoV-2 testing by a direct

one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) method as described below. The specimens were

refrigerated at the collection site and transported to the laboratory in insulated coolers with ice

packs. Detailed instructions for the gargle procedure are included in the supplemental material.

SARS-CoV-2 detection. All samples were vortexed for 2-3 seconds, heat inactivated at 70 °C for
10 minutes in a water bath, and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 2 minutes. ONPS transport medium

(molecular grade water) was diluted 1:3 in molecular grade water (500 µl in 1500 µl) in a 5 ml

cryovial tube (Simport Scientific, Beloeil, Québec, Canada). This dilution was routinely used to

lower the proportion of invalid RT-PCR results (data not shown). Gargles were directly

transferred (1 ml) undiluted in a 5 ml cryovial tube. Cryovial tubes were loaded on a Seegene

STARlet IVD (Seegene, Seoul, Republic of Korea and Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA) for

preparation of PCR microplates for direct RT-PCR without RNA extraction. Direct RT-PCR was

performed using the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection

A volunteer gargled with 5 ml of four different waters (Eska; Naya;

Molecular water BP2819, Fisher Bioreagents; Sterile water for irrigation, Baxter), three times

with each water. One SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive ONPS non-inactivated sample was used to spike

the 12 gargle specimens (1:8 dilution). One spiked gargle from each brand of water was

analyzed immediately and the two other spiked gargles from each brand of water were kept

seven days at room temperature and at 4 °C, respectively, before being analyzed using the same

method described above. Other waters, including tap water, were also tested to evaluate RT-

PCR compatibility (see Table S1 in supplemental material).

Statistical methods.
Data were described by percentage for categorical variables and median with interquartile

range (IQR) for continuous variables. Both gargle and ONPS were compared to a composite

As shown in

Figure 1, 121 individuals (12%) had a PCR-positive ONPS, 123 (12.2%) had a PCR-

positive gargle, and 115 (11.4%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in both samples. There was no

difference in clinical sensitivity between gargle and ONPS, with a Cohen’s kappa coefficient of

0.94 (95% CI 0.89 - 0.96). Six participants had PCR-positive ONPS and PCR-negative gargle: all 6

ONPS contained low viral loads, and 3/6 gargles were found to be weakly PCR-positive when

retested with the Abbott

SARS-CoV-2 assay, which includes an RNA extraction step.

Eight patients had PCR-positive gargle and PCR-negative ONPS: 6/8 gargles contained low viral

loads, and 2/7 ONPS were found to be PCR-positive when retested with the Abbott

RealTime

SARS-CoV-2 assay (one ONPS was lost so could not be retested). Both types of samples showed

a better clinical sensitivity with symptomatic patients, but the difference was only statistically

significant when comparing gargle to the composite reference standard with discrepant analysis

Results were invalid for 2.7% (27 of 1005) ONPS and for 0.9% (9 of 1005) gargles (difference

1.8%, 95% CI 0.64% to 3.07%, p=0.002).

Cycle threshold (Ct) differences were observed for concordant positive paired samples (

and N genes respectively (p < 0.0001). When analyzing Ct differences by different ONPS gene E

Ct intervals, the differences were only significant when the ONPS had a Ct value lower than 25,

representing higher viral loads (

between standard deviations of gargles and ONPS Ct values for RdRp gene (4.18 vs 5.29, p =

Discussion
Testing frequency is considered important to control the COVID-19 pandemic, but this requires

sampling methods with high acceptability in order to address testing hesitancy. Non-invasive

samples like saliva or gargle clearly increase the acceptability of testing (

10)

and alleviate

pressure on limited resources that are currently used to collect oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. We

have gathered after this study many qualitative data confirming the impact of gargle on testing

acceptability and we saw an important increase in healthcare workers adherence to systematic

screening (data not shown). Gargle also widens the possibility of self-collection as it was shown

to have similar sensitivity to a nasopharyngeal swab (

10, 11).

Self-collected non-invasive

specimens can eliminate socio-economical barriers to testing hesitancy and increase patient

satisfaction. Notwithstanding that some evidence suggests that testing frequency could be more

important than analytical sensitivity (

1, 15),

it is essential to demonstrate that novel sampling

methods retain acceptable sensitivity. Like others, we were able to demonstrate that gargle can

be as sensitive as ONPS (

9-11), even without RNA extraction. Our data also demonstrates that it

is important to use a composite reference standard when sampling methods offer similar

Saliva generally requires dilution and/or enzymatic digestion to permit direct RT-PCR without

significant rates of inhibition (

16).

Since gargle is essentially a form of pre-diluted saliva, we

obtained a low rate of PCR inhibition in this study. Preliminary tests showed that some natural

spring waters, as well as local tap water, did not seem to affect direct RT-PCR efficiency when

compared to molecular water (see supplemental material). We chose to use commercial natural

spring waters that were bottled from unique sources, which offers homogeneity and high

chemical stability across time. These water sources are highly regulated and human or

agricultural activity are not allowed near them. In Canada, natural spring waters are readily

available and represent a cheap alternative to more expensive medical grade products that are

prone to shortages during a pandemic. Moreover, we were able to demonstrate stability of viral

RNA for at least 7 days at room temperature, similarly to saliva (

17, 18).

significant advantage since getting rid of the cold-chain can help support surge capacity of SARS-

CoV-2 diagnostic testing (

relative viral loads measured with Cts we observed with gargle compared to EONPs could be

related to the fact that gargle is a diluted saliva sample. However, the viral RNA concentrations

difference was only significant in paired samples with higher ONPS viral loads (Ct < 25). This

could be in part explained by the fact that viral RNA declines more rapidly in the nasopharynx,

since some studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be amplified from saliva for longer

periods (

20-22)

and another study found that gargle was more often positive than ONPS even

when symptoms were present for more than 7 days (

10).

We could also hypothesize that the

viral RNA concentration in the throat and saliva, and thus gargle, is possibly less variable from

one day or from one sample to another compared to the nasopharyngeal swab. As a matter of

fact, when comparing positive gargles and ONPS our data shows statistically significant

differences between the standard deviations of RdRp and N genes Cts, gargles’ Cts being less

variable than those of ONPS. Moreover, some authors found greater variation in human RNase P

Ct values in nasopharyngeal swab specimens than in saliva specimens (

21), consistent with more

variable nasopharyngeal swab specimens quality. The pharynx being at the junction between

the upper and the lower respiratory tract, it could reflect the viral RNA content of both

anatomical compartments as the virus progressively migrate from one site to another. The

absence of significant Ct difference in paired samples containing lower viral loads in ONPS (Ct ≥

25) is not explained by discordant samples, since the latter were well balanced between both

sample types (6 gargle-/ONPS+ and 8 gargle+/ONPS-). One study comparing the performance of

oropharyngeal swab with nasopharyngeal swab for the diagnosis of COVID-19 also found a

similar sensitivity between both sample types, with discordant pairs being also well balanced

between both sample types, and yet they found higher Ct values in oropharyngeal swabs (

23).

Our study has some limitations. Since we were using a direct RT-PCR method, ONPS transport

medium had to be diluted 1:3 to avoid PCR inhibition and hence decrease invalid results rate.

This dilution could have decreased ONPS clinical sensitivity at the advantage of gargle. Also,

symptomatic patients in this study were all recruited within the first seven days of symptom

onset so we cannot extrapolate our results to patients presenting later in the disease course.

Moreover, we cannot either extrapolate our results to nursing home patients or infants/toddlers

who were not included in this study, and who, in our experience, provide gargle samples with

more difficulty.

Conclusion
Natural spring water gargle is as sensitive as ONPS for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in early

symptomatic as well as asymptomatic patients from the community using a direct RT-PCR

method with the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV assay. Non-invasive sampling methods will increase

acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 testing and reduce the need for precious medical grade products

and trained healthcare workforce. More studies are needed and are underway to evaluate the

clinical performance of natural spring water gargle with other PCR assays for the diagnosis of

COVID-19.
