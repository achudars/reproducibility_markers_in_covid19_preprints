Abstract

55

Antibody tests are essential tools to investigate humoral immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While

56

first-generation antibody tests have primarily provided qualitative results with low specificity, accurate

57

seroprevalence studies and tracking of antibody levels over time require highly specific, sensitive and

58

quantitative test setups. Here, we describe two quantitative ELISA antibody tests based on the SARS-CoV-

59

2 spike receptor-binding domain and the nucleocapsid protein. Comparative expression in bacterial,

60

insect, mammalian and plant-based platforms enabled the identification of new antigen designs with

61

superior quality and high suitability as diagnostic reagents. Both tests scored excellently in clinical

62

validations with multi-centric specificity and sensitivity cohorts and showed unprecedented correlation

63

with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. Orthogonal testing increased assay specificity to 99.8%, thereby

64

enabling robust serodiagnosis in low-prevalence settings. The inclusion of a calibrator permits accurate

65

quantitative monitoring of antibody concentrations in samples collected at different time points during

66

the acute and convalescent phase of COVID-19.

1. Introduction

68

Serological testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remains

69

an essential tool for seroprevalence studies and complements PCR-based diagnosis in identifying

70

asymptomatic individuals (1). Antibody tests are gaining additional importance as means to characterize

71

the extent of infection- or vaccine-induced immunity. To cope with the urgent demand for sensitive and

72

reliable test systems, many manual and automated serological tests for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-

73

19) became available within a short period of time (2). Owing to the acuity of a spreading pandemic, many

74

of these early developed test systems lacked adequate validation and thereby fueled mistrust, while

75

stocks of others were exhausted rapidly due to increased demand (3).

76

Antigen selection and quality are crucial aspects of assay development and influence diagnostic

77

performance (4), such as sensitivity and specificity as well as assay availability, scalability and their field

78

of application. Ideal candidate antigens for in-vitro serodiagnosis are highly immunogenic, support early

79

and robust detection of seroconversion after an infection and result in low false positivity rates.

80

Additionally, production platforms supporting high process yields ensure sustainable assay supply. To

81

date, biotechnological performance attributes and their influence on serodiagnostics were not reported

82

during the development of assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Likewise, no comprehensive study comparing

83

and validating the same SARS-CoV-2 antigen produced in different expression systems with larger cohorts

84

is available.

85

In this study, we developed two quantitative, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based

86

serotests relying on SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NP) antigens

87

of superior design and quality. Since these assays utilize established ELISA technology, they are easy to

88

implement in any lab worldwide. We describe a comprehensive approach assessing biotechnological

89

parameters such as antigen quality attributes and manufacturability for an ideal test setup. For this

90

purpose, we compared several animal cell lines and plant-based expression platforms for their ability to

91

support high-quantity and quality RBD production and assessed whether the employed production host

92

influences antigen performance. We extensively validated the tests for clinical utility featuring sera from

93

individuals covering the full spectrum of disease presentations at different time points post infection and

94

a large specificity cohort including samples with antibodies towards human coronaviruses (hCoVs) and

95

those from individuals with underlying non-infectious diseases. Moreover, we validated the tests with

96

time-resolved acute and early convalescent samples from hospitalized patients and showed that only

97

RBD-specific antibodies demonstrate excellent correlation with neutralization assays already in the early

98

phase of infection.

2. Results

100

Comparative profiling of expression hosts for SARS CoV-2 RBD and NP production for diagnostic use

101

Initially, five eukaryotic expression systems were compared for their capacity to support high-quantity

102

and high-quality expression of the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. Our pre-defined quality attributes

103

covered activity in a functional binding assay using a conformation-dependent RBD-specific antibody

104

(CR3022), protein integrity and glycosylation determined by mass spectrometry, as well as

105

manufacturability (Fig. 1A). Biolayer interferometry analysis revealed that RBD obtained from different

106

mammalian and insect expression systems have comparable affinities (range: 21 – 43 nM) for the mAb

107

CR3022 (Fig. 1A, left panel). Glycan analysis confirmed host-specific N-glycosylation of the respective

108

proteins, which was of complex-type for the human (HEK-6E) and non-human mammalian cell lines (CHO-

109

K1, CHO-S) as well as for plant (Nicotiana benthamiana)-derived RBD. We found paucimannosidic N-

110

glycosylation for the Trichoplusia ni insect cell line (Tnms42)-derived RBD (Fig. S1A, B). Peptide mapping

111

verified the integrity of the protein primary structure (data not shown). Unoptimized and small-scale

112

electroporation of non-human (CHO-K1 and CHO-S) and baculovirus infection of insect (Tnms42) cell lines

113

produced overall yields after purification of less than one mg RBD per liter of culture. Polyethylenimine

114

(PEI) transfection of HEK cells readily provided higher overall volumetric yields (~40 mg/L) without further

115

process optimization (Fig. 1A, left panel). Analytical size-exclusion chromatography (HP-SEC) revealed

116

expression platform and production batch-dependent RBD homodimer contents. (Fig. S2). For plant-

117

expressed RBD, dimerization was particularly pronounced. We identified an unpaired cysteine residue

118

(Cys538) close to the C-terminus of the canonical RBD sequence as a possible cause for RBD dimerization.

119

A truncated RBD construct (tRBD) lacking this cysteine residue was less prone to homodimer formation,

120

but retained full functionality in the binding assay and similar expression yields (Fig. 1A, Fig. S3). From a

121

manufacturing perspective, tRBD thus provided less batch-to-batch variation, which is a pre-requisite for

122

a diagnostic antigen.

123

To assess the performance of the antigens for discrimination between sera from SARS-CoV-2-exposed

124

(n=124) and uninfected individuals (n=210), we applied a high-throughput (HTP) automated bead-based

125

multiplex assay (Fig. 1B, C). The performance of diagnostic tests are commonly assessed through receiver

126

operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the analysis of area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). ROC curves

127

are simple graphical representations of the relationship between sensitivity and specificity of a test over

128

all possible diagnostic cut-off values and AUCs give the overall ability of a test to discriminate between

129

two populations (5). We used theses analyses to assess potential differences in the diagnostic

130

performance of RBD from different expression hosts. Almost all antigens at this high purity demonstrated

131

AUC values of >0.99, demonstrating the high suitability of the RBD from any source as diagnostic antigen.

132

The AUC value of insect-derived RBD was slightly lower (AUC: 0.978 [0.964-0.992]); the differences,

133

however, were not significant (Fig. 1B). We then applied antigen-specific cut-offs to compare the

134

performance of the antigens at a pre-defined consensus specificity of 99.1%. At this criterion, we obtained

135

high sensitivities (range 94.4%-96.0%) with all antigens, except for insect-derived RBD. There,

136

seroreactivity with pre-COVID-19 sera was about 22- (4)-fold higher than observed for CHO-expressed

137

RBDs. This resulted in 26% of COVID-19 sera to fall below the threshold, increasing the rate of false-

138

negatives (Fig. 1C). The tRBD displayed a comparable seroreactivity profile to the RBD.

139

During our pre-validation experiments we observed a strong effect of residual host cell proteins on assay

140

performance (Fig. S4), even in formulations derived from human cell lines. Therefore, RBD/tRBDs were

141

purified via an Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) capture followed by a scalable and fast

142

flow-through Anion exchange (AIEX) chromatography step, leading to purities of up to 99%. Owing to

143

reproducible highest production yields of functional protein with adequate diagnostic performance and

144

less batch-to-batch variation, we decided to pursue with HEK-expressed tRBD for our further validations.

146

As the NP of SARS-CoV-1 has been described to be well produced in bacteria (6), we decided to produce

147

the SARS-CoV-2 NP in Escherichia coli. We combined two recently developed generic manufacturing

148

strategies, the CASPON (cpCasp2-based platform fusion protein process) technology (7) and the enGenes-

149

X-press technology (8), allowing for high-level soluble expression of heterologous proteins. NP was

150

expressed as a fusion protein with an N-terminally fused CASPON tag that enables affinity purification and

151

can afterwards be efficiently proteolytically removed, thereby generating the authentic N-terminus. High

152

soluble volumetric titers of 3.7 g/L in a growth-decoupled fed-batch production process yielded 730 mg/L

153

NP after purification with a modified CASPON platform process (Fig. 1A, right panel). This strategy

154

delivered untagged NP protein at exceptionally high quality (93.6% purity, defined as protein full-length

155

content) after a multi-step-downstream process. The remaining impurities consisted of NP-related

156

fragments and RNA. Host cell protein concentration was 0.9 ng/mg NP and dsDNA concentration was 1

157

µg/mg NP, as determined by De Vos and colleagues (9). NP has an intrinsic propensity to oligomerize and

158

displays very slow dissociation from the antibody (Abcam, ab272852). Therefore, we provide an upper

159

limit for the KD value, and calculated kobs values as a surrogate kinetic parameter instead (Fig. 1A, right

160

panel, Fig. S3). The nucleocapsid protein also presented with excellent AUC values of 0.994 (0.988-0.999)

161

and comparable performance to HEK-derived tRBD. While the seroreactivity profile of pre-COVID sera

162

appeared to be more heterogenous against the NP than for tRBD, COVID sera demonstrated a more

163

consistent, robust response against the nucleocapsid protein (Fig 1B, C, right panel). This comprehensive

164

set of biotechnological and assay performance characteristics prompted us to pursue ELISA test

165

development with HEK-expressed tRBD and bacterially produced NP.

166

Assessment of antigen-dependency of false-positive and false-negative results

167

A set of sera (28-31 convalescence sera from the above tested), that was considered to be particularly

168

challenging since it included 80% of the identified outliers or borderline serum samples, was selected to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.21249921; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

169

optimize the conditions for an ELISA with tRBD and NP. At the final conditions (6 µg/mL coating antigen,

170

1:200 serum dilution) we achieved high sensitivities of 85.7% (Luminex) or 100% (ELISA) at the pre-defined

171

consensus specificity criteria (99.1%, Luminex, 92.9% ELISA, Fig. 2A) with both antigens. Our findings from

172

the Luminex antigen pre-validations were in good agreement with the ELISA results, as was demonstrated

173

by the excellent cross-platform correlation of the seroreactivity readouts (tRBD: rs=0.97, p<0.0001; NP:

174

rs=0.87, p <0.0001,). Next, we aimed to assess whether false-positive or false-negative results are

175

independent of the test antigen. With both test formats, up to 50% of the false-negative samples did not

176

simultaneously react with both antigens (Fig. 2B). Concurrently, none of the false-positive sera in the

177

ELISA, and only 20% of the false-positive sera (5 out of 25) in the Luminex test simultaneously reacted

178

with both the tRBD and NP (Fig. 2C). Levels of tRBD- and NP-specific antibodies correlated well with each

179

other (rs=0.75-0.80, p<0.0001, Fig. 2B) and also with the ability of the respective sera to neutralize

180

authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Yet, with partial correlation analysis we could demonstrate that only anti-

181

tRBD antibodies do have a causal relation with viral neutralization (rs=0.68, p=0.0003, Fig. 2D).

182

Cut-off modeling and diagnostic performance of the tests in a large validation cohort

183

The above data provided an indication that reactivity of COVID-19 sera is dependent on the test antigen,

184

fostering the idea for combined use in applications requiring high specificity. Test kits for both antigens

185

were generated (termed Technozym NP or RBD IgG Test, Technoclone, Vienna, AT), providing the antigens

186

in lyophilized form at a coating concentration of 6µg/mL. The kits included a five-point calibrator set,

187

based on the RBD-specific antibody CR3022, to enable quantitative readouts and further expand the tests’

188

application fields.

189

Both the tRBD and the NP ELISA were evaluated using 244 samples from patients with active or previous

190

SARS-CoV-2 infection covering the full spectrum of disease presentations (asymptomatic to individuals

191

requiring intensive care). The large specificity cohort (n=1,126) covered a great variety in samples from

192

pre-COVID times including sera from individuals with rheumatic disease, human coronavirus infections

193

drawn during winter months to increase the likelihood for respiratory infections. A detailed description

194

of the SARS-CoV-2 positive cohorts can be found in Table S1. In ROC-analysis, both assays presented with

195

excellent areas under the curve (tRBD: 0.976, NP: 0.974, Fig. 3A, B). The Youden index was maximal at a

196

cut-off of >2.549 U/mL for tRBD (Youden index=0.901) and at >3.010 U/mL for NP (Youden index=0.882)

197

yielding high sensitivities (tRBD: 95.8% [91.6-97.4], NP: 93.0% [89.1-95.9] at these cut-offs. Yet,

198

specificities (tRBD 95.3% [93.6-96.2], NP 95.1% [93.7-96.3]) were insufficient to yield satisfactory positive

199

predictive values (PPVs), which give the probabilities that an individual with a positive test result indeed

200

has antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. At a low seroprevalence rate of 5% the PPVs at these cut-offs would be

201

equivalent to a coin toss, with 50.2% (43.8-56.5) for tRBD and 50.1% (43.6-56.5) for NP. To increase assay

202

specificity of each test individually, thereby increasing predictability at low seroprevalences, cut-off

203

criteria based on the 99th percentile method were established. Ninety-nine percent of all negative samples

204

showed results below 7.351 (95% CI: 5.733-10.900) U/mL for the tRBD and 7.748 (5.304-11.157) U/mL for

205

the NP ELISA. When shifting the cut-off to 8.000 U/mL (taking a safety margin into account), specificities

206

increased to 99.2% for the tRBD and 99.1% for the NP ELISA. At the same time, sensitivities slightly

207

dropped to 86.3% and 76.7% for the tRBD and NP assays, respectively. The PPVs increased to 84.8% for

208

tRBD and 82.5% for NP (Fig. 3A, B). To monitor of immune responses after infection or vaccination, a cut-

209

off yielding higher sensitivities at acceptable specificities was established. A cut-off between the criteria

210

suggested by the ROC analysis and that calculated by the 99th percentile method, e.g., 5.000 U/mL, yielded

211

a sensitivity of 89.8% and a specificity of 98.0% for the tRBD assay, as well as a sensitivity of 86.5% and a

212

specificity of 98.3% for the NP assay (Fig. 3A, B).

214

Orthogonal testing approach at very low seroprevalences to approximate 100% specificity

215

For low seroprevalences, when specificities need to approximate 100% in order to achieve acceptable

216

PPVs, we considered an orthogonal testing approach (OTA). Our previous experiments already provided

217

an indication that false-positives among pre-COVID-19 sera do not necessarily react with both antigens

218

(Fig. 2C). As a classical OTA might negatively affect sensitivities an adaptive, sensitivity-improved (SI-OTA)

219

was applied (10). To this end, the above-described validation cohorts were screened with the tRBD ELISA.

220

All samples with results ranging between the cut-off defined by the Youden index (taking a safety margin

221

of, i.e., 3.000 U/mL into account) and 35.000 U/mL (as no false-positives occurred above 31.500 U/mL)

222

were re-tested with the NP ELISA. There, also the Youden index criterion, adding a safety margin, was

223

applied for positivity (>3.500 U/mL). Samples with <3.000 U/mL in the screening test were considered

224

negative; samples with results between 3.000 U/mL and 35.000 U/mL in the screening tests and at the

225

same time >3.500 U/mL in the confirmation test were considered positive; samples >35.000 U/mL in the

226

screening test were considered positive. Applying these criterions 133 of 1,370 samples needed to be re-

227

tested. In turn, this approach led to a significantly enhanced specificity (99.8% [99.4-100.0]) when

228

compared to the tRBD test alone both at a cut-off of 5.000 U/mL (+0.019, P<0.0001) and 8.000 U/mL

229

(+0.006, P=0.035). Compared to the latter, sensitivity (88.1% [83.4-91.9]) was improved (+0.037, p<0.050)

230

and the PPV rose to 96.3% (86.7-99.1), see Fig. 3C. To achieve this improvement, only 133 (i.e., those with

231

tRBD levels between 3.000 and 35.000 U/mL) of the overall 1,370 samples needed to be re-tested by the

232

NP assay, resulting in less than 10% increase in testing volume.

233

Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies with endemic and seasonal coronaviruses

234

To better characterize our specificity cohorts, we explored the prevalence of antibodies towards common

235

cold coronaviruses and possible cross-reactivities with our assays. To do so, outliers among the pre-

236

COVID-19 cohort were defined as sera with readouts higher than the 75th percentile + 1.5x interquartile

237

range (IQR) of the total cohort seroreactivity towards the SARS-CoV-2 NP or tRBD (outlier NP: n=17; tRBD:

238

n=4). Above these cutoffs, all sera from our specificity cohorts reacted strongly with the spike proteins of

239

circulating human coronaviruses (hCoVs) HKU-1, OC43, 229E, and NL63, confirming widespread

240

seroprevalence in the general population (Fig. 4A, B). To further characterize the identified outliers among

241

the pre-COVID-19 sera, we calculated their relative IgG signals, set them in relation to a roughly equal

242

number of sera located at the other extreme on the seroreactivity scale (sera with readouts <25th

243

percentile toward the respective antigen) and compared the differences in relative IgG levels to that

244

towards hCoV antigens. Among our pre-validation cohort, sera with highest relative reactivity towards NP

245

(mean difference: 0.88, p>0.0001) also demonstrated significantly elevated relative median IgG levels

246

towards the spike protein of HKU-1 (mean difference: 0.13, p=0.0113, Fig. 4B). The specificity cohort we

247

used for clinical validation included 8 sera from individuals with PCR-confirmed hCoV infection. None of

248

these yielded false-positive readouts at a cutoff of 5.000 U/mL (Fig. 4C) at comparably low specificities of

249

95.3% (tRBD) and 96.1% (NP) (see Fig. 3A, B).

250

Clinical evaluation of test performance after symptom onset

251

Diagnostic accuracy of the Technozym NP or RBD IgG Tests was evaluated at different time points after

252

symptom onset in plasma from hospitalized individuals (general ward and intensive care unit [ICU]

253

patients) and outpatients. A total of 104 plasma samples were drawn during the acute and early

254

convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. NP-specific IgG levels correlated well with tRBD-specific IgG

255

levels, even at levels being below the set threshold for seropositivity (1-5 d: rs=0.67, p<0.0001; 6-10 d:

256

0.76, <0.0001; 11-15 d: 0.76, 0.0006, Fig. 5). The positivity rates increased over time, peaking at 100% 15-

257

22 days after symptom onset in both assays. True positivity rates for the NP ELISA were consistently higher

258

than with the tRBD ELISA at all time points (1-5 d: NP vs tRBD: 14.7% vs 5.9%; 6-10 d: 45.7% vs 34.2%; 11-

259

15 d: 76.5% vs 64.7%, Fig. 5 and Table S2). Yet, sera displayed a great heterogeneity in antibody levels

260

throughout the observation period (Table S2). None of the false-negative results among the samples were

261

obtained with both assays. Astonishingly, 85.7% of the sera already contained neutralizing antibodies

262

(median titer: 1:24; range 1:4 – 1:128, Table S2) as soon as by day 5 after symptom onset. Of these,

263

however, only a total of 18% of the sera demonstrated seroreactivity above the cut-off for either the NP

264

or tRBD antigen (Fig. 5). Yet, the quantitative nature of the assay allowed us to correlate antibody levels

265

below the cut-off for seropositivity and we could demonstrate excellent correlation of tRBD-specific

266

antibodies with neutralizing function at all four investigated time points (1-5 d: rs=0.49, p=0.0004; 6-10 d:

267

0.77, <0.0001; 11-15 d: 0.82, <0.0001; 16-22: 0.67, 0.0003, Fig. 5).

3. Discussion

269

Superb assay specificity is of utmost importance for the assessment of antibodies directed against SARS-

270

CoV-2, as a substantial proportion of infected individuals escapes identification due to the frequent

271

asymptomatic course of the disease, thereby distorting the true humoral seroprevalence in any given

272

population (11). The biological basis for false-positives is multifactorial, but the influence of the

273

production platform and process-related peculiarities or impurities on protein performance are factors

274

that are often underestimated. While the viral NP is almost always produced in bacteria (12, 13), we

275

expressed the spike receptor binding domain in HEK cells, CHO cells, insect cells and plants (4, 14–16). To

276

find out which of these systems leads to the highest quality and manufacturability of the RBD diagnostic

277

antigen of potentially high demand, we evaluated these production platforms and pre-validated the

278

proteins based on diagnostic performance with a large set of pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 sera using the

279

Luminex platform. All five expression platforms demonstrated suitability for the production of functional

280

protein, proven by a binding assay with the SARS-CoV-2-RBD-specific mAb CR3022. Yet, in part due to the

281

different transfection methods used, RBD yields from CHO-K1, CHO-S as well as from Tnms42 insect cells

282

and tobacco plants were insufficient for sustainable commercial antigen production (< 1mg/L, Fig. 1). In

283

contrast, HEK cells readily produced overall yields of 40 mg/L using PEI-transfection. Yields of 30 mg/mL

284

per liter have also been described for CHO-expressed RBD. However, this can be traced back to optimized

285

design of expression constructs and improved production processes for stable RBD-expressing CHO cells

286

together with less extensive purification protocols (17). We observed higher basal seroreactivity of control

287

sera with insect-derived RBD than with RBD from human and non-human mammalian cell lines; which is

288

in line with other reports (4). Host-related impurities do not account for that, as insect-cell produced RBD

289

demonstrated the highest purity among all our RBD samples (99%, Fig. S2). While there was a common

290

set of false-positive samples shared by RBD from non-human and human mammalian cell lines as well as

291

plants, false-positives reactive with the insect material were entirely insect-RBD-specific (Fig. S6). A

292

possible reason may be platform-specific protein modifications, such as glycosylation, that provide the

293

protein with a unique process-derived signature. Indeed, T. ni-derived insect cells were demonstrated to

294

generate core α1,3-fucose structures with allergenic potential in humans (18), which might be associated

295

with this peculiar seroreactivity profile.

296

Based on our observation that RBD tends to form homodimers in an unpredictable manner among

297

different production batches of the same expression host, we used an optimized, truncated version of an

298

RBD as diagnostic antigen -tRBD-, enabling the production of large amounts of RBD with consistent quality

299

(Fig. S2). For tRBD performance, antigen purity was of utmost importance, even when expressed in human

300

cell lines. At a consensus specificity of 99.1%, a reduction in tRBD purity by 10% (pure: 97.5%, impure:

301

87.5% purity) resulted in a drastic reduction in sensitivity by 83.9% (pure: 95.2% versus impure: 11.3%,

302

respectively) in the Luminex pre-validation assays (Fig. S4). Since purity after an IMAC capture step was

303

highly batch-dependent and resulted in inconsistent seroreactivity profiles, our standard downstream

304

process included a scalable AIEX chromatography polishing step to account for these inconsistencies and

305

to improve the diagnostic performance of the antigens.

306

The two test antigens, tRBD from HEK cells and NP from E. coli, were further used for ELISA assay

307

development. We configured the assays with a number of sera taken from SARS-CoV-2-infected

308

individuals with weak antibody responses to ensure high assay sensitivity. In contrast to available

309

literature, we used high antigen coating concentrations (6 µg/mL) to yield satisfactory readouts (4, 19, 20)

310

and to achieve a high dynamic measurement range. A caveat of many assay validation studies is that

311

performance characteristics are skewed by the exclusive inclusion of samples from hospitalized

312

individuals, where robust antibody levels are to be expected (21). Likewise, the sole consideration of

313

healthy donors in control groups may lead to overestimated assay specificity, as the impact of potential

314

cross-reactive factors present in the general population is largely ignored. In this respect, auto-antibodies

315

commonly found in individuals with inflammatory diseases (22) were already described to cross-react with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.19.21249921; this version posted January 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

316

SARS-CoV-1 antigens (23). To challenge our tests systems, we biased our large specificity cohort (n=1,126)

317

by including samples with an increased propensity for cross-reactivity, including sera from individuals with

318

inflammatory illnesses (n=359), sera from PCR-confirmed hCoV infections (n=8) and sera drawn during

319

winter months to increase the likelihood of respiratory infections (n=494). Similarly, our sensitivity cohort

320

(n=244) included convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals covering the full spectrum of

321

clinical manifestations (from asymptomatic to ICU patients). Among them 21% of the sera were collected

322

from asymptomatic individuals or from individuals with mild to moderate illness, who may mount less

323

robust and durable antibody responses after an infection (24). Based on these cohorts, we defined

324

adequate test parameters to enable highly specific detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. A cutoff

325

deduced by the 99th percentile method (8.000 U/mL) allowed for high specific serodiagnosis with 99.2%

326

for the Technozym RBD Test and 99.1% for the Technozym NP Test (at sensitivities of 86.3% and 76.7%,

327

respectively). This is a remarkable result for a tetramethylbenzidine-based manual test system,

328

considering the highly diverse nature of our study cohorts. While some automated systems were

329

described to achieve specificities approximating 100% (25, 26), assay performance is highly cohort-

330

specific. The use of diverse study cohorts was also associated with performance deteriorations in such

331

test platforms (i.e. Abbot, Specificity: 97.5%)(27). For the Meduni Wien Biobank cohort we had

332

performance data with CE-marked automated test systems available (10) to directly compare with our

333

ELISAs at the high specificity cut-off criterion (8.000 U/mL). With an AUC of 0.987 [0.979-0.992] and a

334

specificity of 99.1%, the NP ELISA presented with comparable performance to the Abbott SARS-CoV-2

335

chemiluminescence microparticle assay (AUC: 0.993 [0.987-0.997], Fig. S5, Sp 99.2%) (10), that also relies

336

on the NP antigen. The tRBD ELISA even outperformed the DiaSorin LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG

337

chemiluminescence assay (tRBD ELISA: AUC/Sp/Sen=0.993/99.2%/84.9% vs DiaSorin:0.976/98.2%/82.8%,

338

see Fig. S5 and Perkmann et al (10). While we cannot rule out minor cross-reactivity between hCoV-

339

specific antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 antigens, they appeared to have a limited effect on assay

340

performances (Fig. 4C).

341

Yet, for an estimated seroprevalence of 5% in the general European population (28, 29), a test with a

342

specificity and sensitivity of 99.2% and 86.3%, respectively, only scores a PPV of 85.0% resulting in 15

343

false-positive results out of 100, which is still insufficient. In line with previous results from us and others

344

(30–32), we demonstrate that false-positive results are largely antigen-dependent (Fig. 2B, Fig. 4C).

345

Orthogonal testing is suggested by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to remedy

346

specificity problems in low transmission settings (33). Previous studies have used RBD as screening antigen

347

and the trimeric spike protein or the spike S2 domain in second-line tests to confirm initial positive results

348

(4, 32). Such conventional orthogonal test strategies, however, increase specificity often at the expense

349

of sensitivity. We therefore established an adaptive orthogonal test algorithm where positive sera were

350

first identified with the tRBD ELISA allowing for highly sensitive testing (at the expense of specificity) and

351

samples within a predefined area of uncertainty then underwent confirmatory testing with the NP ELISA

352

(10). This two-test algorithm resulted in a cumulative specificity of 99.8% and an even higher sensitivity

353

of 88.1% (+0.037, p<0.050),yielded a PPV of 96.3% [86.7-99.1] (Fig. 3). This is an excellent result for a

354

manual test format and its specificity is on par with other orthogonal tests relying on automated systems

355

(10).

356

As the Technozym NP and RBD ELISAs provide a five-point calibrator, set ELISA antibody levels can be

357

quantified, compared and followed over time. For such an application, we chose a cut-off of 5.000 U/mL

358

that allowed for more sensitive analysis of antibody levels at acceptable specificity, adapted from the cut-

359

off given by the Youden index. With convalescent sera taken at median 43-54 days post-symptom onset,

360

the tRBD ELISA allowed for a more sensitive detection of antibodies than the NP ELISA (Fig. 3A, B). Yet,

361

time-resolved analysis of seroconversion demonstrated that NP-specific antibodies develop earlier after

362

an infection and true positive rates were consistently higher with the NP ELISA for samples collected

363

within the first 15 days post-symptom onset (Fig. 5, Table S2). This phenomenon has already been

364

described in patients infected with SARS-CoV-1(34, 35) and was associated with higher sensitivities of

365

other SARS-CoV-2 test systems, relying on the NP, in the early phase after an infection (36). Determining

366

the neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD antibodies is critical to elucidate possible protective

367

effects of the immune response. Considering all neutralizing activity above background as positive, we

368

observed neutralizing antibodies in 85% of the sera already by day five after symptom onset (Fig. 5), which

369

is in line with previous studies (37, 38). Of note, RBD-seroconversion, defined by antibody levels above a

370

threshold of 5.000 U/mL, was observed for only 6% of the sera at this time point. Yet, despite 33 out of

371

35 samples demonstrating reactivity below our pre-defined cutoff, neutralizing titers correlated well with

372

RBD-specific IgG responses. A recent study demonstrated that the early neutralizing response is

373

dominated by RBD-specific IgA antibodies (39). As we exclusively measured RBD-specific IgG responses

374

we cannot rule out that part of the early neutralizing activity we observe derive from neutralizing IgA or

375

even earlier IgM responses.

376

Tests for the screening of reconvalescent COVID-19 patients for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2

377

antibodies are of great interest for identifying suitable donors for convalescent plasma therapy (40). A

378

retrospective, propensity score–matched case–control study performed at the Mount Sinai hospital (New

379

York, NY) provides evidence for a survival benefit in patients receiving convalescent plasma transfusion as

380

an effective intervention in COVID-19 (40). In August 2020, the FDA issued a new guidance on the

381

Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 convalescent plasma, recommending plasma donations

382

to be qualified by either the Mount Sinai COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test or Ortho VITROS IgG assay

383

(41). Prior to this guidance, NTs of at least 1:160 were considered acceptable in the absence of high-titer

384

samples (42). As we did not have the beforementioned tests available, we qualified plasma donors

385

according to the NT 1:160 criterion. The fraction of samples exceeding this threshold gradually increased

386

over time and by day 15 after symptom onset, 53% of the sera and by day 22, 72% of sera had titers higher

387

than 1:160 (Fig. 5, Table S2). The geometric mean RBD titers in these sera corresponded to 159.1 U/mL

388

and 183.7 U/mL, respectively. Since correlates of protection from infection remain to be determined we

389

cannot deduce whether these titers are clinically relevant in prophylaxis, at this point.

390

4. Discussion

391

In conclusion, we have developed two highly specific, quantitative, easy-to-implement and now

392

commercially available SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests and defined optimal thresholds for their application in

393

different aspects of clinical use. In addition to their simple format, the two tests are equally well suited as

394

most automated CE-marked systems for high specificity applications, such as seroprevalence studies.

395

Moreover, the RBD ELISA allows for the identification of donors for convalescent plasma therapy as RBD-

396

specific antibody levels correlate well with the induction of functional neutralization responses. Both tests

397

allow to comprehensively monitor the dynamics of antibody responses after infection. Yet, our data

398

disclose different kinetics for antigen-specific antibody responses, which affect their performance at

399

different time points after an infection. These findings are essential for ongoing efforts to establish

400

serological tests for clinical diagnostics. In this respect, also test performance with convalescent sera

401

collected more than 2 months after infection and the effect of antigen-specific antibody waning should

402

be carefully addressed in future studies and compared to the comprehensive findings of this study.

Medium-scale cultivation. Stepwise upscaling was performed using a Multi-bioreactor system DASGIP

452

(Eppendorf, Hamburg, DE) followed by a 10 liter scale bioreactor System BioFlo320 (Eppendorf, Hamburg,

453

DE). The bioreactors were inoculated at half the final volume (F17 expression medium supplemented with

454

4 mM L-Glutamine and 0.1% Pluronic) with a seeding density of 0.5 x 106. cells/mL. The inoculum was

455

prepared in shake flask cultures as described above. The bioreactors were controlled to a pH of 7.2 using

456

CO2 and 7.5% (w/V) carbonate base and to 50% (v/v) dissolved oxygen by submerged aeration.

457

Transfection was performed at a cell concentration of 1.7 x 106. PEI and the respective plasmid DNA were

458

diluted in media mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes prior to addition to the cultures

459

(45 µg PEI and 15 µg of plasmid per 106 cells). Twenty four hours post transfection, cells were expanded

460

and 24 hours later were fed a TN1 peptone at a concentration of 0.5% (v/v). Each day post-transfection

461

viability, cell density and glucose concentration were measured and a daily bolus feed to a glucose

462

concentration of 2.5 g/L was performed. The cultures were harvested once viability dropped below 60%.

463

Chinese hamster ovary cells

464

CHO-K1 and CHO-S cells were routinely propagated in CD-CHO medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

465

Waltham, MA) or in Hyclone Actipro medium (Cytiva, Chicago, IL) both supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) Anti-

466

Clumping Agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and 8 mM L-glutamine (CHO-K1, Sigma Aldrich,

467

468

were cultivated in suspension at 37°C, 7% (v/v) CO2 and humidified air, shaking at 140 rpm.

469

For nucleofection, a total of 1 x 107 cells in the exponential growth phase were pelleted for 8 min at 170

472

water to a concentration of 2 µg/µL in a total volume of 11 µL and were electroporated with a Neon®

473

Nucleofector using a 100 μL Neon® Transfection Kit (all Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with 1700

474

V and one pulse of 20 ms. Seven to eight transfections per cell line were performed and subsequently

475

pooled in a 500 mL shake flask with a 200 mL working volume. Supernatants were harvested five days

476

post transfection by centrifugation (170 g, 10 min) and were sterile-filtered before further use.

477

Insect cells

478

Tnms42, an alphanodavirus-free subclone of the High-Five insect cell line (52, 53) , were routinely

479

propagated in adherent culture in HyClone SFM4 insect cell medium (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) at 27°C

480

and were expanded in suspension culture for recombinant protein expression. A passage one virus seed

481

stock expressing the SARS CoV-2 RBD was amplified in Sf9 cells to generate a passage three working stock

482

and was titrated by plaque assay as previously described (54). Tnms42 insect cells at 2 x 106 cells/mL were

483

infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of two, and the supernatant was harvested three days post-

484

infection, clarified (1,000 g, 10 min, followed by 10,000 g, 30 min) and was filtered through a 0.45 µm

485

filter before downstream procedures.

Tobacco plants

487

The pEAQ-HT-RBD expression vector was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain UIA143 (44).

488

Syringe-mediated agroinfiltration of leaves from five-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana ΔXT/FT plants was

489

used for transient expression (55). Four days after infiltration, leaves were harvested and intracellular

490

fluid was collected by low-speed centrifugation as described in detail elsewhere (56).

decoupled recombinant protein production as described elsewhere(8) Briefly, for cultivation cells were

495

grown in fed-batch mode in a 1.0 L (0.5 L batch volume, 0.5 L feed) DASGIP® Parallel Bioreactor System

496

(Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, DE) equipped with standard probes (pH, dissolved oxygen [pDO]). The pH was

497

maintained at 7.0 ± 0.05, temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C during the batch phase and decreased

498

to 30 ± 0.5°C at the beginning of the feed phase. The dissolved oxygen level was stabilized at > 30% (V/V).

499

Induction of NP production was facilitated at feed hour 19 with the addition of 0.1 mM IPTG and 100 mM

502

Purification of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and tRBD from different expression systems

503

His-tagged RBD and tRBD from filtered HEK supernatants, as well as RBD from Tnms42 insect cell

504

supernatants, were concentrated and diafiltrated against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer supplemented

505

with 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.4) using a Labscale TFF system equipped with a PelliconTM

506

XL Ultracel 5 kDa, 0.005 m² ultrafiltration module (Merck, Darmstadt, DE). The proteins were captured

507

using a 5-mL HisTrap FF Crude or a 1-mL HisTrap Excel immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)

508

column connected to an ÄKTA Pure chromatography system (all from Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) and were

509

eluted by applying a linear gradient of 20 to 500 mM imidazole over 5 to 20 column volumes, as

510

appropriate. Intracellular fluid collected from plant material was directly loaded onto a 5-mL HisTrap HP

511

column and was purified as described elsewhere (57). CHO-K1 and CHO-S expression supernatants were

512

supplemented with 20 mM imidazole and were directly loaded onto a 1-mL HisTrap FF column connected

513

to an ÄKTA Start chromatography system (both Cytiva, Marlborough, MA), equilibrated with 50 mM

514

sodium phosphate buffer supplemented with 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.4). Proteins were

515

eluted by applying a linear gradient of 20 to 500 mM imidazole over 20 column volumes.

516

Fractions containing RBD or tRBD were pooled and either diluted with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer

517

(pH 7.4) to a conductivity of ~10 mS/cm and then loaded onto a Fractogel EMD DEAE column (Merck

518

Millipore, Germany) or loaded onto HiTrap DEAE FF column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA), both pre-

519

equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). A residence time of 2 minutes was used. The

520

flow-through fractions, containing RBD or tRBD, were collected. Impurities were subsequently eluted

521

using 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 1 M NaCl, pH 7.4 and the column was cleaned in place by

522

incubation in 0.5 M NaOH for 30 minutes. The protein of interest present in the flow-through fraction was

523

buffer-exchanged into PBS using Amicon Ultra-15 Ultracel 10 kDa spin columns (Merck Millipore,

524

Germany) or was dialyzed against PBS. IMAC-captured RBD from insect cell supernatants was ultra-

525

and diafiltrated using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units (10 kDa MWCO, Merck Millipore) to change

526

the buffer to PBS and was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/600

527

Superdex 200 pg column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) equilibrated with the same buffer. Fractions

528

containing RBD were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Ultracel 10 kDa spin columns (Merck Millipore,

529

Germany). All purified proteins were quantified by measuring their absorbance at A280 with a Nanodrop

530

instrument and stored at -80°C until further use.

531

Purification of SARS-CoV-2 NP from E. coli cellular lysates

532

The purification of NP was optimized and performed as described by De Vos and colleagues (9). In brief,

533

NP was produced by using the CASPON platform process(45) with modifications. The process consisted of

534

an IMAC capture step (WorkBeads 40 Ni NTA, Bio-Works, Uppsala, SE) of the clarified cell lysate. A

535

nuclease treatment (Salt Active Nuclease High Quality, ArcticZymes Technologies ASA, Tromsø, NO) was

536

required to reduce CASPON-NP nucleic acid binding. Imidazole was removed from the IMAC eluate using

537

a Butyl Sepharose HP hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Cytiva, Uppsala, SE) which also separated

538

full-length from fragmented CASPON-NP. A variant of cpCasp2 (7) was used to remove the affinity fusion-

539

tag. Finally, an IMAC polishing step was used to separate native NP from residual CASPON-NP, the free

540

affinity fusion-tag, the affinity-tagged cpCasp2 variant and metal binding host cell proteins. The polishing

541

fraction was buffer exchanged to PBS using tangential flow filtration on Pellicon 3 Ultracel 10 kDa

542

membrane (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, DE).

543

Purification of mAb CR3022

544

mAb CR3022 was purified by affinity chromatography using a 5-mL HiTrap Protein A HP column connected

545

to an ÄKTA pure chromatography system (both from Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) according to the

546

manufacturer's protocol. The antibody was eluted using 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.5). Eluate fractions

547

containing CR3022 were immediately neutralized using 1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), pooled and

548

concentrated using Amicon ultrafiltration cartridges with a cut-off of 10 kDa (Merck, Darmstadt, DE) and

549

were further dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) at 4°C overnight using SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing with a 10 kDa

550

cut-off (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, DE). CR3022 was further purified by size exclusion

551

chromatography using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) equilibrated

552

with the same buffer as used for dialysis.

5.3 Assessment of recombinant protein quality

561

5.3.1

Analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC)

562

High-performance liquid chromatography (HP)-SEC experiments were performed on a Dionex™

563

UltiMate™ 3000 RSLC system equipped with an LPG-3400SD Standard Quaternary Pump module, a WPS-

564

3000 TSL Analytical Split-Loop Well Plate Autosampler and a DAD-3000 Diode Array Detector equipped

565

with a ten µL analytical flow cell (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, DE). RBD, tRBD and NP

566

samples (25-80 µg per sample) were run on a Superdex™ 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva, Uppsala,

567

SE) and UV signals were detected at λ = 280 nm. For RBD and tRBD, Dulbecco’s PBS buffer (DPBS)

568

supplemented with 200 mM NaCl was used as mobile phase, the flow rate was set to 0.75 mL/min and a

569

45 min isocratic elution was performed. For NP samples 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)

570

containing 300 mM NaCl was used as mobile phase, the flow rate was set to 0.5 mL/min and a 60 min

571

isocratic elution was performed. HP control, data acquisition and data evaluation were performed using

572

Chromeleon™ 7.2 Chromatography Data System software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, DE).

573

Sample purity (P), monomer (M), dimer (D) and full-length (FL) content were determined based on the

574

respective peak area of the UV signal at 280 nm. For RBD and tRBD purity was defined as P=(M+D)/total

575

area, monomer and dimer content were respectively defined as M[%]=M/(M+D)*100 and D=100-M[%].

576

For NP, full-length content was defined as FL[%]=FL/total area.

577

5.3.2

Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) measurements

578

Interaction studies of RBD, tRBD and NP with in-house produced anti-RBD mAb CR3022 and a commercial

579

anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein antibody (ab272852, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were performed on

580

an Octet RED96e system using high precision streptavidin (SAX) biosensors (both from FortéBio, Fremont,

581

CA). Antibodies were biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

582

Waltham, MA). Excess sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was quenched by adding Tris-HCl buffer (800 mM, pH 7.4) to a

583

final concentration of 3 mM. Biotinylated antibodies were further purified using PD-10 desalting columns

584

(Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All binding assays were conducted

585

in PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.1% (w/V) BSA (PBST-BSA) at 25°C with the plate

586

shaking at 1,000 rpm. SAX biosensors were first equilibrated in PBST-BSA and then loaded with the

587

respective biotinylated capture molecules, either for 180 sec (34 nM CR3022 solution) or until a signal

588

threshold of 0.8 nm was reached (50 nM anti-NP mAb solution). Subsequently, antibody-loaded

589

biosensors were dipped into PBST-BSA for 90 sec to record a baseline, before they were submerged into

590

different concentrations of their respective analytes. To determine KD values, biotinylated antibodies

591

loaded onto biosensors were exposed to six concentrations of the binding partners (RBD, tRBD or NP) to

592

cover a broad concentration range around the respective KD value (58). For antigen association, mAb

593

CR3022 was exposed to a three-fold serial dilution of RBD or tRBD (range: 300 nM - 1.2 nM in PBST-BSA)

594

for 300 sec, while anti-NP mAb-was dipped into two-fold serial dilutions of the NP protein (40 nM - 1.3

595

nM in PBST-BSA) for 600 sec. For dissociation, the biosensors were dipped into PBST-BSA. Each experiment

596

included a baseline measurement using PBST-BSA (negative control) as well as a positive control (RBD

597

monomer) where applicable. SAX biosensors loaded with biotinylated CR3022 or anti-NP mAb could be

598

regenerated by dipping them into 100 mM glycine buffer (pH 2.5). RBD or tRBD proteins were measured

599

in triplicates or quadruplicates, while NP proteins were measured in duplicates. No unspecific binding of

600

proteins to SAX biosensors was observed. Data were evaluated under consideration of the lower limit of

601

detection (LLOD) and lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) as reported elsewhere (59, 60). The analysis was

602

performed using the Octet data analysis software version 11.1.1.39 (FortéBio, Fremont, CA) according to

603

the manufacturer's guidelines. For easier comparison of the RBD variants produced in different expression

604

hosts, the KD values were determined from the measured equilibrium response (steady state analysis).

605

However, the interaction between the CR3022 mAb and the final tRBD batches were also evaluated

606

kinetically by fitting the BLI data to a 2:1 heterogeneous ligand binding model. Note, although the CR3022

607

mAb has two identical binding sites, the second binding event is dependent on the first binding since

608

allosteric effects or sterical hindrance can ultimately lead to a positive or negative cooperative binding

609

behavior (51, 61, 62). However, in case of the reported interaction, the affinity constant (KD) values are

610

very close to one other in the low nanomolar range.

611

The interaction between the NP protein and the anti-NP mAb is difficult to characterize due to avidity

612

effects that arise from the dimeric nature of both interaction partners. Kinetic evaluation of the BLI data

613

is problematic since the dissociation curves are heterogenic. Additionally, if the dissociation phase shows

614

less than 5% decrease in signal during the defined dissociation phase, as observed for the lower

615

concentration range of NP protein, a precise determination of the dissociation rate constants (kd) is not

616

possible (63, 64). However, it is feasible to calculate an upper limit for the kd (s-1) which is given by

617

kd<−ln(0.95)/td, where td is the dissociation time in seconds (63, 65) Thus, an upper limit for the KD value,

618

calculated by the ratio of kd/ka, resulted in < 0.7 nM, suggesting a strong interaction in the picomolar

619

range. Moreover, for comparison of single batches the observed binding rate (kobs) was plotted as a

620

function of the NP concentration and used for the comparison of the single batches.

621
622

Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS)

623

Purified proteins were S-alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested with endoproteinases LysC (Roche,

624

Basel, CH) and GluC (Promega, Madison, WI) or chymotrypsin (Roche, Basel, CH) in solution. Digested

625

samples were analyzed using a Thermo Ultimate 3000 HP connected to a 150 x 0.32 mm, 5 µm BioBasic

626

C18 column (both Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and a maXis 4G QTOF mass spectrometer

627

(Bruker, Billerica, MA). An 80 mM ammonium format buffer was used as the aqueous solvent and a linear

628

gradient from 5% B (B: 80% acetonitrile) to 40% B in 45 min at a flow rate of 6 µL/min was applied, followed

629

by a 15 min gradient from 40% B to 95% B that facilitated elution of large peptides. The MS system was

630

equipped with the standard ESI source and operated in positive ion, DDA mode (= switching to MSMS

631

mode for eluting peaks). MS-scans were recorded (range: 150-2,200 Da) and the six highest peaks were

632

selected for fragmentation. Instrument calibration was performed using ESI calibration mixture (Agilent,

633

Santa Clara, CA). The analysis files were converted (using Data Analysis, Bruker) to mgf files, which are

634

suitable for performing a MS/MS ion search with MASCOT. The files were searched against a database

635

containing the target sequences. In addition, manual glycopeptide searches were done. Glycopeptides

636

were identified as sets of peaks consisting of the peptide moiety and the attached N-glycan varying in the

637

number of HexNAc, hexose, deoxyhexose and pentose residues. Theoretical masses of these peptides

638

were determined using the monoisotopic masses for the respective amino acids and monosaccharides.

using a seven-plex bead-based Luminex-FlexMap system-based serotest and were available at the AIT.

687

These serotests had been conducted similar to the analysis procedure outlined below. Seronegativity

688

and/or seropositivity was based on cut-off values and end-point titers defined according to Frey et al (67)

689

on the basis of 160 pre-COVID-19 sera. Additionally, the study cohort included a set of 28 COVID-19 sera

and 229E (all from Sino Biological Inc, Beijing, CN) were separately coupled to MagPlex carboxylated

716

polystyrene microspheres (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instruction,

717

with the following minor modifications: For coupling, five µg of each antigen was used per one million

718

microspheres. Coupling was performed in a total volume of 500 µL in 96-Well Protein LoBind Deepwell

719

plates (Eppendorf, Hamburg, DE) and plates were incubated at 600 rpm on a Heidolph Titramax 1000 plate

720

shaker (Heidolph, Schwabach, DE). After each incubation step plates were centrifuged at 400 g for one

721

minute. To collect the microspheres at the bottom of the plate, plates were placed on a Magnetic plate

722

separator (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) and the supernatant was poured off by inverting the plates.

723

Coupling was performed in 200 µL coupling buffer (50 mM MES, pH 5.0). Microspheres with coupled

724

proteins were stored in Assay buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% (w/V) BSA, 0.05% (w/V) NaN3, pH 7.4) at

725

a final concentration of 10,000 microspheres per µL at 4°C in the dark. Sera of patients and controls were

726

five-fold diluted in PBS-Triton X-100 buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% (V/V) Triton X-100, 0.05% (w/V)

727

NaN3, pH 7.4) and were further diluted 240-fold with Assay buffer. Coupled microspheres (800 beads per

728

sample) were first equilibrated to room temperature for 30 min. Plates were then vortexed for 30 sec and

729

sonicated for 20 sec using a Transsonic T470/H sonicator (Elma Electronics, Wetzikon, CH). The required

730

amounts (based on multiples of samples to be analyzed) of microspheres (+10% excess) were transferred

731

to 1.5 mL Protein LoBind tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, DE) and centrifuged for 3 min at 1,200 g. Microtubes

732

were then placed on a Magneto Dynal magnetic tube separator (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supernatants

733

were carefully removed and microspheres were resuspended in 200 µL Assay buffer. Different

734

microspheres were then combined in a 50 mL Falcon tube to yield a total of 800 microspheres per coupled

735

antigen in 30 µL assay buffer per single measurement. Thirty µL of the mixed microsphere suspension was

736

then transferred to wells of a clear 96-well microplate (Corning Inc, Corning, NY). Assay plates were placed

737

on the magnetic plate separator and supernatants were poured off by inverting the plates. Fifty µL of sera

738

(1:1,200-diluted) or assay buffer (blank samples) was applied to each well. Assays were incubated for two

739

hours at RT on the plate shaker (600 rpm). Assay plates were placed on the magnetic plate holder and the

740

supernatants were poured off by inverting the plates. Microspheres were washed by removing the

741

magnetic plate holder and the addition of 100 µL Wash buffer (PBS; 0.05% (V/V) Tween-20; 0.05% (w/V)

742

NaN3; pH 7.4) per well. After two minutes of incubation at room temperature, plates were again placed

743

on the magnetic plate holder and supernatants were poured off. After three wash steps 50 µL of a 1:1

744

mixture of 2.5 μg/mL goat anti-human R-Phyco AffiniPure F(ab')2, Fcγ-specific (# 109-116-098) and F(ab')2-

747

the dark. Microspheres were then washed again three times and microspheres were resuspended in 100

748

µL Assay buffer and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was immediately measured on a Flexmap 3D

749

Suspension Array System (BioRad, Hercules, CA) with a minimal Count of 100 per microsphere type, a DD

750

Gating of 7,500-25,000 and the Reporter Gain set to "Enhanced PMT (high)". MFI values were extracted

751

from FM3D result files. A minimum microsphere count of 25 counts was set as cut-off. All samples and

752

single bead types analysed fulfilled the minimum bead count criterium. FM3D results files were compiled

753

in Microsoft Excel and were log2-transformed and blank-corrected by subtracting the mean MFI values of

754

blank samples (assay buffer only) from MFI values of the test samples.

755

5.6.2

ELISA Assay

756

Initially, ELISA conditions were optimized in terms of antigen coating conditions (0.5 – 8 µg/mL) and

757

serum-dilutions (1:50 – 1:3,200) to optimize the tradeoff between background seroreactivity and

758

sensitivity in samples from individuals with weak antibody responses. The final protocol was as follows:

759

SARS CoV-2 and hCoV antigens (see above) were diluted to 6 µg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PAN

760

Biotech #P-04-36500) and 50 µL were added to each well of MaxiSorp 96-well plates (Thermo #442404).

761

After incubation at 4°C overnight, wells were washed 3x with PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (Merck #8.22184¸ PBS-

762

T) and blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with PBS-T + 3% (w/V) milk powder (Fluka #70166). Serum

763

samples were diluted 1:200 in PBS-T + 1% (w/V) milk powder. 100 µL were applied to each well and plates

764

were incubated for 2 h at RT with shaking (450 rpm). Plates were washed 4x before incubation with goat

765

anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated antibodies (Sigma #A0170;

766

1:50,000 in PBS-T + 1% (w/V) milk powder, 50 µL/well) for 1 h at RT while shaking. After 4 washes, freshly

767

prepared substrate solution (substrate buffer [10 mM sodium acetate in dH2O, pH 5, adjusted with citric

768

acid] + 1:60 TMB-stock [0.4 % Tetramethylbenzidine (Fluka #87748) in DMSO] + 1:300 H2O2 [0.6% in dH2O)

769

was applied (150 µL/well) and plates were incubated for 25 minutes at RT with shaking. Reactions were

5.7 TECHNOZYM Anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD and NP IgG ELISAs Assays

773

The above-described methodology was slightly adapted for the development of the TECHNOZYM Anti

774

SARS-CoV-2 NP and RBD IgG ELISA test kits (Technoclone, Vienna, AT). The tests plates were provided with

775

the antigens coated at a concentration of 6 µg/mL and lyophilized according to a proprietary in-house

776

protocol. The RBD test kit employs the described tRBD as coating antigen. To allow for a quantitative

777

measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels, a calibrator set consisting of five calibrators with assigned

778

values was provided for the creation of a calibration curve and was run in parallel with the patients’

779

samples. The calibrated values were established using the monoclonal antibody CR3022 as a reference

780

material, with 1 U equivalent to 100 ng/mL mAb CR3022 (#Ab01680-10.0, Absolute Antibody, Oxford, UK).

781

The calibrator set covered the concentration range 0 – 100 U/mL and concentrations of anti SARS-CoV-2

782

IgG antibodies recognizing either tRBD or NP in patient sera could be read directly from the calibration

783

curve.

784

5.8 Technozym NP and RBD IgG ELISA Test validations

785

The established NP and RBD IgG ELISA assays were either processed manually and analyzed on a Filtermax

786

F5 plate reader (Molecular Devices, San José, USA) or on an Immunomat instrument (Serion Diagnostics,

787

Würzburg, DE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IgG antibody levels were reported as numeric

788

values in form of arbitrary U/mL derived from the five-point calibration curve. Cut-offs for test validations

789

were determined by ROC-analysis and the non-parametric 99th right-sided percentile method (CLSI C28-

790

A3). Sensitivities, specificities, PPV, and negative predictive values (NPV, both at 5% estimated

791

seroprevalence) were calculated. ROC-analysis data from automated tests (including Abbott ARCHITECT

SARS-CoV-2 IgG, DiaSorin LIAISON® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG) were available for 64 of the positive and

793

1117 of the negative samples from a previously published study (30).

794

5.9 SARS-CoV-2 Neutralisation Assay

795

A tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay for authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus was developed for the

796

determination of neutralizing antibodies. The virus was originally isolated from a clinical specimen, a

797

nasopharyngeal swab taken in mid-March 2020 from a 25-year old male patient in Lower Austria, and was

798

further passaged twice on Vero E6 TMPRSS-2 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with

799

10% (V/V) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Vero E6 TMPRSS-2 cells, initially described in Hoffmann et al.(70) were

800

kindly provided by Stefan Pöhlmann; Deutsches Primatenzentrum, Göttingen, Germany.

801

Briefly, assays were performed with Vero 76 clone E6 cells (CCLV-RIE929, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute,

802

Riems, Germany) cultured in minimum essential medium Eagle (E-MEM) with BioWhittaker Hank's

803

balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Lonza, Basel, CH) supplemented with 10% (V/V) FBS (Corning Inc, Corning,

804

NY). Neutralizing antibody titers in human serum and plasma were determined as previously described

805

(71) with the following alterations: the heat-treated sera were diluted 1:4 in triplicates in serum-free

806

HEPES-buffered DMEM medium. In the case neutralizing antibody titers were determined in human

807

lithium heparin plasma, no heat-treatment was applied and the medium was supplemented with 1x

808

Antibiotic/Antimycotic solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The heat treatment had no

809

effect on neutralizing titers, as verified in a pre-experiment on SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative plasma

810

samples. In addition, a toxicity control, which was processed the same way as plasma samples, was

811

included. Here, no virus was added, to prevent a false readout of the assay. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was

812

evaluated and scored for each well using an inverted optical microscope. To determine neutralization titer

813

the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that protected more than 50% of the cells from the CPE was

814

used and was calculated according to Reed and Muench (72) .Briefly, assays were performed with Vero

76 clone E6 cells (CCLV-RIE929, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Riems, Germany) cultured in minimum

816

essential medium Eagle (E-MEM) with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) (BioWhittaker, Lonza, Szabo

817

Scandic, Austria) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Corning, Szabo Scandic, Austria) (FBS).

818

For the assay both sera and plasma was used.

819

5.10 Statistical analyses

820

Raw data were assessed for normality of distribution and homogeneity of variances using the D’Agostino–

821

Pearson omnibus test before statistical procedures. Differences in median seroreactivities between pre-

822

COVID and COVID sera were compared using the Mann-Whitney U tests on blank-corrected log2-

823

transformed median fluorescence intensities (Luminex data) or OD490 absorbances (ELISA), respectively.

824

Correlation analyses of nonparametric data were performed by Spearman’s rank-order correlation (rs),

825

otherwise Pearsons’ correlation (r) was used. Relative IgG signals of outliers against SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV

826

antigens were compared by One-Way ANOVA followed by a Sidak test to correct for multiple comparisons.

827

ROC-analysis data from automated tests were compared to the established ELISA tests according to

828

DeLong. Sensitivities and specificities were compared by z-tests. Data on the diagnostic performances of

829

antigens and cross-reactivity were analyzed using Graphpad Prism Version 8.1.0 (GraphPad Software, San

830

Diego, CA, USA) Validation data were analyzed using MedCalc v19 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium)

831

and Analyse-it 5.66 (Analyse-it Software, Leeds, UK) and SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc.). Data from SARS-CoV-2 acute

832

sera from hospitalized individuals or outpatients obtained by the B&S Central Laboratory Linz were

833

statistically analyzed with the MedCalc 13.1.2.0.
