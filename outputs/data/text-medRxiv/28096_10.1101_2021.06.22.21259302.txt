Abstract

Background: Wei et al. have published a meta-analysis (MA) which aimed to “evaluate the
association between SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes”.

Using classical random-effects model, they found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with

preeclampsia, preterm birth and stillbirth.

Performing MA with low event rates or with few studies may be challenging as MA relies on several

within and between study distributional assumptions.

Methods: to assess the robustness of the results provided by Wei et al., we performed a sensitivity
analysis using several frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis methods. We also estimated fragility

indexes.

Results:

For eclampsia

(patients with

Covid-19

vs without),

the confidence intervals of most

frequentist

models contain 1. All beta-binomial models (Bayesian) lead to credible intervals containing 1. The

prediction interval, based on DL method ranges from 0.75 to 2.38. The fragility index is 2 for the DL

method.

For preterm, the confidence (credible) intervals exclude 1. The prediction interval is broad, ranging

from 0.84 to 20.61. The fragility index ranges from 27 to 10.

For stillbirth, the confidence intervals of most frequentist models contain 1. Six Bayesian MA models

lead to credible intervals containing 1.The prediction interval ranges from 0.52 to 8.49. The fragility

index is 3.

Interpretation: Given the available data and the results of our broad sensitivity analysis, we can only
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated to preterm, and may be associated

to preeclampsia. For stillbirth, more data are needed as none of the Bayesian analyses are

conclusive.

Background

Wei et al. (1) have recently published a systematic review and meta-analysis (MA) which aimed to

“evaluate the association between SARS-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy

outcomes”.

The authors show that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with preeclampsia, preterm birth and

stillbirth. They also stated that they used Mantel-Haenszel method, but the results of figure 2 are

related to a random-effects inverse-variance model, with DerSimonian-Laird estimate of tau² and

continuity correction.

Higgin's I2 was used to assess heterogeneity. Although this approach is widely mentioned, the point

estimate I2 should be interpreted cautiously when a MA has few studies (2), and the confidence

interval should be provided.

MA

relies

on

several

within

and

between

study

distributional

assumptions

that

are

sometimes

hidden (3).

Several methods are available to assign weights in meta-analyses, e.g. Mantel-Haenszel for fixed-

effect MA or inverse-variance for fixed-effect or random-effects MA. For random-effects MA, there

are several ways to estimate the between-study variance, e.g. DerSimonian and Laird (DL), restricted

maximum likelihood (REML). Finally, there are also different ways to estimate the confidence interval

for the summary effect (e.g. Wald or Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) method). The same apply

to confidence interval for the between-study variance (e.g. Q-Profile method). See (4,5) for more

information.

Performing MA with low event rates or with few studies, or both, may be challenging. For example,

estimating between-study heterogeneity is difficult in this case, and inaccurate estimation of this

heterogeneity may lead to too narrow confidence intervals.

Statistical methods can never completely resolve the issue of sparse data. Different methods may

give different results, and using a suboptimal approach may lead to erroneous conclusions (6).

Methods

In order to assess the robustness of the results provided by Wei et al. (1), we performed a sensitivity

analysis using a range of frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis methods. We also estimated fragility

indexes (and Fragility Quotient, which is fragility index divided by the total study sample size). This

intuitive measure of the robustness of a trial, is a number indicating how many patients would be

required to convert a trial from being statistically significant to not significant (7). This index has been

adapted for MA (8) and is currently being refined methodologically (19). We estimated FI with DL

method and restricted maximum likelihood with Knapp-Hartung (KNHA) test.

Wei

et

al.

reported

three

outcomes:

preeclampsia,

preterm

and

stillbirth.

We

focused

on

preeclampsia and stillbirth which contain sparse data.

For frequentist MA, several methods were used (9,10), including that of Hemni and Copas, which was

found to be less sensitive to publication bias than DL method (11,12) (see tables). Although not

optimal, continuity correction (0.5) was applied to studies with zero cells, in order to compare our

results with the work of Wei et al. (1).

According to IntHout et al (18), we have also presented prediction interval, only for the model used

by Wei et al. (1). It is the interval within the effect size of a new study would fall, if this study was

selected at random from the same population of the studies already included in the MA.

For Bayesian MA, we used a binomial-normal hierarchical model (BNHM), i.e., modelling probabilities

of success in each group (13), instead of modelling estimates of log odds-ratios directly (normal-

normal model) for the between trial heterogeneity. We also used a beta-binomial (BB) model, which

has

shown

good

statistical

properties

for

meta-analysis

of

sparse

data

(14,15).

With

these

approaches, no continuity correction (of any type) is required as these models are based on the exact

distributional assumptions unlike (commonly used) normal-normal hierarchical model. Several priors

were used as sensitivity analysis (16,17).

Statistical analyses were performed with Stata (frequentist framework) and R software (Bayesian

framework).

Results

All estimates are shown in tables 1 and 2 and in appendix 1 (tables 3 and 4).

In some cases, no estimation was possible: this is the case for permutations, when less than six

studies were included in the meta-analysis. Under these conditions, Bayesian estimates are more

appropriate.

For eclampsia in general (comparing patients with Covid-19 vs without Covid-19), the confidence

intervals of most frequentist MA models contain 1 (table 1).

The prediction interval, based on DL method ranges from 0.75 to 2.38.

The fragility index is 2 for the DL method used by the authors and the same with the REML-HKSJ

method.

As

for

the

Bayesian

approach,

all

three

beta-binomial

models

of

MA

lead

to

credible

intervals

containing 1. For binomial normal models, credible intervals do not contain one, but the upper

bound of the interval is very close to 1.

For eclampsia when comparing patients with severe vs mild Covid-19, the frequentist sensitivity

analysis confirms the authors' results, except for one model out of 12 (Kenward-Roger’s model).

The prediction interval, based on DL method ranges from 0.84 to 20.61.

The fragility index is 2 for DL method and 1 with REML-HKSJ method.

When an heterogeneity of 75% is taken into account, the difference between the two groups is no

longer significant.

Concerning the Bayesian analysis, only the binomial-normal models confirmed Wei et al. (1) initial

results. None of the three beta binomial models results in credible intervals excluding 1.

For preterm (global analysis comparing patients with Covid-19 vs without Covid-19, or subgroup

analysis comparing patients with symptomatic vs asymptomatic Covid-19), all frequentist models

used in our sensitivity analysis lead to confidence or credible intervals excluding 1, except inverse

variance heterogeneity model and Hemni-Copas’s method (table 3, appendix).

But the prediction interval, based on DL method is very broad, ranges from 0.84 to 20.61.

The fragility index ranges from 27 (global analysis with for the DL method) to 10 (subgroup analysis

comparing symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients, with REML-HKNHA method). Details on these

fragility indexes and quotients are in table 4 (Appendix).

All Bayesian credible intervals also exclude 1.

Finally for stillbirth, the confidence intervals of most frequentist meta-analysis (MA) models contain 1

(table 2).

The prediction interval, based on DL method ranges from 0.52 to 8.49.

The fragility index is 3 for the DL method and 3 with REML-HKNHA method.

As for the Bayesian approach, all six MA models lead to credible intervals containing one.

Interpretation

We performed a large sensitivity study taking into account different approaches (frequentist and

Bayesian) and different statistical models in order to estimate several parameters including odds

ratio, I2, Tau and their respective confidence intervals.

With the exception of preterm infants, regardless of the frequentist or Bayesian statistical approach,

confidence intervals of odds ratio frequently overlap 1 and thus show no association between Covid-

19 and the occurrence of eclampsia or stillbirth. The prediction intervals are very wide and contain 1,

for all three endpoints (eclampsia, stillbirth and preterm). Finally, the fragility indexes are only 1, 2 or

3 for eclampsia and stillbirth.

Concerning our Bayesian sensitivity analysis, our results are robust to variation of the priors.

Some authors have proposed the use of generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to perform MA with

sparse

data

(20).

We

have

not

used

GLMM.

Here

again,

several

approaches

are

available.

We

considered that our sensitivity analysis was sufficiently broad. Finally, we did not take into account

the quality of the studies via risk-of-bias analysis, which is possible through meta-regression.

Conclusion

Given the available data and the results of our broad sensitivity analysis we can only suggest that

SARS-CoV-2

infection

during

pregnancy

is

associated

to

preterm,

and

may

be

associated

to

preeclampsia. For stillbirth, more data are needed as none of the Bayesian analyses are conclusive.
