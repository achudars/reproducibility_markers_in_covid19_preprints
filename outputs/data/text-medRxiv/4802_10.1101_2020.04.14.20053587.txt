ABSTRACT
Background: ​It has been projected that there will be too few ventilators to meet demand during
the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic. Ventilator sharing has been suggested as a crisis
standard of care strategy to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and
practicality of shared ventilation in patients is unknown. We designed and evaluated a system
whereby one mechanical ventilator can be used to simultaneously ventilate two patients who
have different lung compliances using a custom manufactured flow control valve to allow for
individual adjustment of tidal volume and airway pressure for each patient.
Methods: ​The system was first evaluated in a simulation lab using two human patient simulators
under expected clinical conditions. It was then tested in an observational study of four patients
with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Two separately ventilated COVID-19 patients
were connected to a single ventilator for one hour. This intervention was repeated in a second
pair of patients. Ventilatory parameters (tidal volume, peak airway pressures, compliance) were
recorded at five minute intervals during both studys. Arterial blood gases were taken at zero,
thirty, and sixty minutes. The primary outcome was maintenance of stable acid-base status and
oxygenation during shared ventilation.
Results:​ Two male and two female patients, age range 32-56 yrs, participated. Ideal body weight
and driving pressure were markedly different among patients. All patients demonstrated stable

physiology and ventilation for the duration of shared ventilation. In one patient tidal volume was
increased after 30 minutes to correct a respiratory acidosis.
Conclusions:​ Differential ventilation using a single ventilator and a split breathing circuit
with flow control valves is possible. A single ventilator could feasibly be used to safely
ventilate two COVID-19 patients simultaneously as a bridge to full ventilatory support.

Introduction
The COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented large number of
hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, with patients requiring mechanical ventilation
for prolonged periods of time.​1,2​ Our experience in the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in
New York City has been similar, with approximately 10% of all COVID-19 positive patients
admitted to date requiring mechanical ventilation, a median duration of ongoing ventilatory
support of 9.3 days, 26% mortality despite ventilatory support, and only 25% of patients were
extubated successfully (data not shown). This equates to nearly 50% of intubated patients
continuing to require ventilatory support. Although the MSHS currently has enough ventilators
to meet demand, the slow but steady rise in the number of intubated patients requiring prolonged
ventilation is concerning. As this pandemic now spreads throughout the country and around the
globe, especially in developing countries, tens of thousands more such patients are expected,
leading to even greater concern that there will be insufficient ventilators to meet demand.​3​ The
United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps published a statement that a possible
crisis standard of care strategy is the ventilation of two patients with a single mechanical
ventilator.​4​ The document described the challenges that must be overcome, and asserted that such
a strategy should only be considered as an absolute last resort.
The safety and efficacy of shared ventilation is unknown. A Consensus Statement of six
professional organizations including the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM), American
Association for Respiratory Care (AARC), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA),
Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (ASPF), American Association of Critical-Care Nurses

(AACN), and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), advised clinicians that sharing
mechanical ventilators "should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current
equipment” (see Appendix).​5
Despite these concerns, the Governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, issued a statement at
the end of March 2020 approving the use of ventilator sharing as a last resort.​6​ We therefore
proceeded to design a novel system and method of shared ventilation that uses a custom
manufactured flow control valve to overcome the important challenges of currently proposed
systems.
The purpose of this study was to design and build a system that uses a single standard
mechanical ventilator to (1) safely ventilate two patients simultaneously, (2) allow individualized
setting of tidal volumes and airway pressures, and (3) address the concerns listed in the
Consensus Statement by testing it in consented COVID-19 patients as a proof of concept.
Methods
Split Circuit
The split circuit system design is as follows (Figure 1). The ventilator breathing circuit is split
using standard T-pieces and connectors. Attached to either end of the T-piece is a custom
designed and manufactured adjustable flow control valve, followed by a one-way valve, and then
the inspiratory limb of the breathing circuit. The flow control valve is an investigational device
not yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An Emergency Use Authorization has
been submitted. At the distal (patient) end, a standard spirometry sensor is placed in-line between
the endotracheal tube (ETT) elbow connector and the wye connector of the breathing circuit. The

sensor is connected to the gas analyzer-spirometry module of a physiologic monitoring system.
At the distal end of each expiratory limb, a one-way valve is placed between the circuit wye
connection and the expiratory tubing. The ends of the two expiratory limbs are joined with a
T-piece that connects to the expiratory port of the ventilator. Bacterial/viral (B/V) filters are
placed between the elbow connector and the ETT, and at the inspiratory and expiratory
connection ports on the ventilator.

Simulation Protocol
Two high-fidelity Human Patient Simulator mannequins (HPS Anesthesia Simulator Mannequin
Systems, CAE Healthcare, Sarasota, FL) were used for simulation. We tested the system under a
variety of simulated patient physiologies likely to be encountered in patients with acute
respiratory failure due to COVID-19, using both a GE-Datex-Ohmeda S5 anesthesia machine
and a Puritan Bennett 840 ventilator (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). The ventilator system
checks were run and the split breathing circuit was connected to the two mannequins, designated
Mannequin A and Mannequin B. The ventilator was set to Pressure Control mode and both
mannequins were set to simulate identical compliance. With both valves open the driving
pressure on the ventilator was adjusted to deliver a tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg ideal body weight
(IBW) to Mannequin A.

Mannequin A was then adjusted to the minimum compliance and Mannequin B to the maximum
compliance setting available on the simulator. Control valve B was turned in measured
increments to a partially closed position until Mannequin B received a similar tidal volume to its

baseline. Then, the driving pressure on the ventilator was increased to deliver approximately the
same tidal volume to Mannequin A. Thereafter, control valve B was adjusted clockwise to a
more closed position to maintain the same tidal volumes for the more compliant Mannequin B.
Driving pressure, peak pressure, tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and
degree of valve opening were recorded throughout each simulation session experiment.

Clinical Protocol
The use of this crisis-driven modification of the ventilator breathing circuit was done with the
knowledge and agreement of the Program for the Protection of Human Subjects at the Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Four patients with acute respiratory failure due to
COVID-19 who had already been on mechanical ventilation with sedation and paralysis for 1-12
days, and expected to require continued prolonged ventilatory care, were identified. The patients
were required to have similar minute ventilation, PEEP, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO​2​)
requirements. Informed Consent and Permission for Emergency Procedure with an Unapproved
Article was obtained from the legally authorized representative of both patients prior to
beginning the study. The patients were moved into the same room in an intensive care unit and
connected to full physiologic monitoring. Each patient was placed on pressure control ventilation
with the same respiratory rate, PEEP, and FiO​2​. The driving pressure of each patient’s ventilator
was adjusted to achieve a tidal volume of 4-6 ml/kg of IBW. The patients were then observed for
a period of 20 minutes to ensure they were hemodynamically stable, and a baseline arterial gas
sample was taken. Simultaneously, the split ventilation circuit including flow control valves was

fully assembled and a third ventilator was set up between the two patient beds and tested with a
single circuit. The single circuit was removed and the split circuit was connected.

The shared ventilator was set with the parameters of the patient with the higher driving pressure.
Split ventilation was then initiated by clamping the ETT of each patient, disconnecting them
from their individual ventilators, and quickly connecting the split circuit. The flow control valve
of the patient with the lower driving pressure was quickly throttled down to almost full close,
and then slowly opened to achieve similar tidal volumes to the patient’s baseline value. The
patients were closely monitored with an intensivist and anesthesiologist at bedside. Thirty
minutes after going on the shared circuit, an arterial blood gas was drawn from each patient and
the flows to each patient adjusted as needed. After sixty minutes, another arterial blood gas was
drawn. At this point, the patients were disconnected from the split circuit by clamping their ETT
and reconnected to their individual ventilators. The patients were closely monitored for an
additional one hour after termination of the study, in order to ensure that they were stable and
had returned to their baseline respiratory status.
Results
Simulation Study
The split circuit performed as expected in both simulator scenarios (identical compliance and
disparate compliance). Figure 2 shows the flow control valves connected to the inspiratory port
of a ventilator in the simulation lab. Results of the simulation are shown in Figure 3. As the flow
control valve was progressively opened from a full close position, the title volume delivered to

the attached mannequin began to rise in a non-linear but controllable fashion. This was
demonstrated across a range of simulated lung and chest wall compliance combinations.
Patient Results
The system performed as predicted by the simulation and there were no adverse sequelae in any
of the patients. We were able to successfully ventilate the two pairs of patients for one hour from
a single ventilator, with independent adjustment of tidal volume and pressure for each patient.
Afterward, each patient was reconnected to a separate ventilator. All study patients remain alive
and still ventilator-dependent.
Baseline patient demographics are shown in Table 1. In the first pair, Patient A was a
49-year-old female with an IBW of 46 and Patient B was a 55-year-old male with an IBW of 64.
Both patients were sedated and paralyzed for the duration of the study. At baseline both patients
were stable on a moderate degree of hemodynamic support (Patient A: norepinephrine 130
ng/kg/min, Patient B: norepinephrine 100 ng/kg/min). The results of an arterial blood gas drawn
at time 0 just prior to initiation of split ventilation are shown in Table 2.
After baseline arterial blood gas measurements, the patients were switched to the split circuit.
The flow control valve on Patient A was slowly dialed down until a tidal volume of ~6 ml/kg
IBW was obtained. Tidal volumes for both patients initially decreased and airway pressures
increased (Figure 4). They then remained stable for 30 minutes. An arterial blood gas drawn at
30 minutes demonstrated that Patient A had developed a respiratory acidosis (Table 2). The flow
control valve for Patient A was slowly opened until a tidal volume of ~8 ml/kg IBW was
achieved (Figure 4). The patients were observed for another 30 minutes under these new

conditions. A final arterial blood gas was drawn, demonstrating that the respiratory acidosis of
Patient A had been corrected (Table 2). The patients were then simultaneously reconnected to
their original ventilators and the study was terminated.
For the second pair, Patient A was a 32-year-old male with an IBW of 62 kg, and Patient B was a
56-year-old female with an IBW of 46 kg. Neither patient was on hemodynamic support.
Notably, Patient A had extremely poor lung compliance of 12 mL/cm•H​2​O and required a
driving pressure of 24 cm•H​2​O, whereas Patient B was more compliant (21 mL/cm•H​2​O) and
required a much lower driving pressure of only 13 m•H​2​O. Once again both patients were
ventilated for one hour with no adverse sequelae (Table 2 and Figure 4).
Discussion
Using a rapid bench-to-bedside approach, we developed a split ventilation circuit that utilizes
custom manufactured flow control valves to deliver differential ventilation to two patients
connected to a single ventilator. While other groups have proposed similar solutions, we believe
that this is the first study to test this technique of using individual flow control valves during
shared ventilation in human subjects.​7​ Our study validates that this approach to split ventilation is
effective and safe in a small series of COVID-19 patients who differed significantly in size and
lung compliance. Both pairs of patients tolerated one hour of shared ventilation with no adverse
effects and were alive as of the time of writing. This study demonstrates this technique as a
potential bridge to full ventilatory support.
As the number of patients with COVID-19 who require prolonged ventilation increases, the
potential lack of mechanical ventilators is worrisome. States and institutions have protocols for

allocation of mechanical ventilators such that some salvageable patients by default may receive
only palliative care, as exemplified by the New York State Ventilator Allocation Guidelines.​8
Opportunity for ventilation can be increased if ventilator sharing can be safely utilized. The
concept of ventilator sharing is not new, and simulated ventilator sharing has been previously
described.​9–12​ However, the only report that describes the use of a valve in a breathing circuit to
achieve differential lung ventilation in clinical practice was in a single patient.​13​ At least one
recently published protocol provides guidance on shared ventilation, but it has limitations.​6
Differential ventilation using one ventilator and a split circuit with flow control valves
adequately addresses all of the concerns expressed in the consensus statement that recommends
against shared ventilation (see Appendix) and has advantages over previous protocols. The
adjustable flow valves allow the pressure and volume delivered to each patient to be
continuously individualized and titrated to changes in compliance. Appropriately-placed
spirometry sensors enable accurate measurement of the delivered tidal volume, airway pressure,
compliance, and end-tidal CO​2​ for each patient individually. These data can be displayed on a
wall-mounted or portable monitor. The unidirectional valves in both the inspiratory and
expiratory limbs prevent reverse gas flow in the circuits or mixing of breathing gas between
patients.
Limitations
Our current design has several limitations. First it does not allow for individualized control of
respiratory rate, PEEP, or FiO​2​. In our limited clinical experience, this did not prove to be a
significant issue in critically ill COVID-19 patients in the acute phase of their disease. Second, it

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20053587; this version posted April 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

requires prolonged sedation and paralysis, although many COVID patients require paralysis for
optimal ventilation. Third, if one patient in the pair decompensates there may be a significant
increase in ventilatory requirement requiring them to be separated emergently from the split
circuit and connected to an independent means of ventilation (e.g., Ambu bag). Fourth, even with
B/V filters it is possible that bacterial super-infection could be spread between patients. However
the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps guideline on Optimizing Ventilator Use
during the COVID-19 Pandemic includes a statement from the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) stating the following with regard to infection control of co-vented patients: "...with the
criteria specified and if done with currently established infection control interventions to reduce
healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator associated infections, any additional risk is
likely to be small and would likely be appropriate in a crisis standard of care."​14​ Fifth, it will not
be possible to wean patients from controlled ventilation while they are on the split circuit. This
is a known limitation and we do not expect weaning to be attempted while patients are sharing a
ventilator. Finally, our design adds an additional layer of complexity with which not many
clinicians will be familiar, thus introducing possible use error that could cause significant harm.

We have successfully demonstrated that patients of differing size and lung compliance can be
independently ventilated with different tidal volumes and pressures using a single ventilator and
a split circuit system with flow control valves. The clinical performance of this novel circuit was
predicted using high fidelity simulation. We were able to compensate for respiratory acidosis in
one patient without affecting the other. All patients remained hemodynamically stable without
any negative effect on oxygenation. This approach may be used as a bridge to a next level of
therapy, providing acute mechanical ventilation for a short period of time while the next best
course of action is determined. Further evaluation is needed to confirm that this system may also
be used for longer periods of time. A rapid innovation will be addition of purpose-designed
calibrated PEEP valves in the expiratory limbs.

Appendix - Response to Consensus Statement on Multiple Patients per Ventilator
Our novel setup addresses the concerns expressed in the Consensus Statement on Multiple
Patients per Ventilator.​1
1. Volumes would go to the most compliant lung segments.
Placement of control valves in both limbs of the split circuit and measurement of
individual patient tidal volumes enables separate control of each tidal volume.
2. Positive end-expiratory pressure, which is of critical importance in these patients,
would be impossible to manage.
This can be addressed by choosing patients requiring similar levels of PEEP. If it is
determined that PEEP requirements for the patients have begun to diverge significantly,
the patients should be removed from split ventilation and placed back on individual
ventilators.
3. Monitoring patients and measuring pulmonary mechanics would be challenging, if
not impossible.
Individual patient monitoring is accomplished using separate gas analyzer/spirometry
tubing for each patient, connected to separate monitors.
4. Alarm monitoring and management would not be feasible.
Individual spirometry monitoring alarms are available and can be used.
5. Individualized management for clinical improvement or deterioration would be
impossible.
With a control valve in each inspiratory limb, individualized management is possible-not
impossible.
6. In the case of a cardiac arrest, ventilation to all patients would need to be stopped to
allow the change to bag ventilation without aerosolizing the virus and exposing
healthcare workers. This circumstance also would alter breath delivery dynamics to
the other patients.
Not necessarily. If one patient arrests, the valve on the breathing circuit can be closed, the
expiratory limb clamped, and ventilation immediately continued using a self-inflating
manual resuscitation device.

7. The added circuit volume defeats the operational self-test (the test fails). The
clinician would be required to operate the ventilator without a successful test,
adding to errors in the measurement.
The ventilator would be tested with a single circuit prior to sharing. Measurements can be
individualized.
8. Additional external monitoring would be required. The ventilator monitors the
average pressures and volumes.
Individual monitoring is available.
9. Even if all patients connected to a single ventilator have the same clinical features at
initiation, they could deteriorate and recover at different rates, and distribution of
gas to each patient would be unequal and unmonitored. The sickest patient would
get the smallest tidal volume and the improving patient would get the largest tidal
volume. The greatest risks occur with sudden deterioration of a single patient (e.g.,
pneumothorax, kinked endotracheal tube), with the balance of ventilation
distributed to the other patients.
The use of flow control valves and​ ​individual patient monitoring and alarms overcome
these risks.
10. Finally, there are ethical issues. If the ventilator can be lifesaving for a single
individual, using it on more than one patient at a time risks life-threatening
treatment failure for all of them.
Each institution has their own Crisis Management Policy that should address this.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Split Circuit with Flow Control Valves. ​All components shown are standard
breathing circuit components, aside from the flow control valves (in grey) that were 3D printed.
The flow control valves are connected to the inspiratory side of the ventilator.
Figure 2. Split Circuit System Connected to a Ventilator. ​Flow control valves and split circuit
connected to a ventilator in the simulation lab, in this case an anesthesia machine ventilator.
Figure 3.​ ​Tidal Volumes During Simulation. ​Top panel: Mannequins set to equal compliance.
Bottom panel: Mannequins with differing compliance. Compliance is a unitless dimension set on
the simulator with range 0.15 - 10. Higher numbers indicate greater compliance. The bottom
panel demonstrates that tidal volume increased in the more compliant mannequin as the valve
was opened, while staying essentially constant in the less compliant mannequin.
Figure 4. Tidal Volumes and Peak Airway Pressures During the Human studies. ​Tidal
volumes are shown in solid lines and peak airway pressures are shown in dashed lines. Left
Panel: Study 1. At the start of the study, tidal volumes fell for both patients, and peak airway
pressures rose. Both parameters then stabilized. The red line indicates when the flow control
valve for patient A was further opened by ¾ of a turn. The tidal volume and peak airway
pressure for patient A subsequently rose, while the tidal volume and peak airway pressure for
patient B remained unchanged. Right Panel: Study 2. Tidal volume fell and peak airway pressure
rose, as in study 1. The red line indicates valve adjustment for Patient B. In this case, the valve
was closed slightly and then opened again to allow slightly more flow. Tidal volume for Patient
B remained nearly the same while peak airway pressure rose.
