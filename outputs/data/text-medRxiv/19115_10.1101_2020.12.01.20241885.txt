Abstract
The Covid-19 disease has caused a world-wide pandemic with more than 60
million positive cases and more than 1.4 million deaths by the end of November
2020. As long as effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, self-isolation and quarantine as well as far-reaching shutdowns of economic activity and public life are the
only available strategies to prevent the virus from spreading. These interventions
must meet conflicting requirements where some objectives, like the minimization
of disease-related deaths or the impact on health systems, demand for stronger
counter-measures, while others, such as social and economic costs, call for weaker
counter-measures. Therefore, finding the optimal compromise of counter-measures
requires the solution of a multi-objective optimization problem that is based on
accurate prediction of future infection spreading for all combinations of countermeasures under consideration. We present a strategy for construction and solution
of such a multi-objective optimization problem with real-world applicability. The
strategy is based on a micro-model allowing for accurate prediction via a realistic
combination of person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and disease progression models including micro-level inclusion
of governmental intervention strategies. For this micro-model, a surrogate macromodel is constructed and validated that is much less computationally expensive
and can therefore be used in the core of a numerical solver for the multi-objective
optimization problem. The resulting set of optimal compromises between counter-

Introduction

The Covid-19 disease, caused by infection with the virus SARS-CoV-2, was first detected
end of 2019 in China before spreading all over the world within a few months. Symptoms
of an infection include fever, dry cough and fatigue, as well as sore throat and loss of
taste and smell [7]. While the majority of patients are either asymptomatic or have mild
symptoms, for around 5.7 % (data from the US [4]) of people the disease can lead to lifethreatening conditions such as pneumonia which in many cases leads to hospitalization.
Out of these, about 40 % are moved to the intensive care unit (ICU). Current studies
show that approximately 3 % of people die from a Covid-19 infection worldwide [2, 38].
This so-called mortality rate is higher for people with underlying health conditions, such
as COPD, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus or serious heart conditions [5] and lower for
children and young adults [36].
Compared to the average mortality (death per 100,000 population) of influenza,
the average mortality of Covid-19 is significantly higher (2.0 for influenza vs. 62.5 for

Covid-19 e.g. in the US [6]). This, together with the high infectiousness of the SARSCoV-2 virus has led to national restrictions of the public life in order to prevent the
health care system from becoming overwhelmed. These restrictions include the closure
of schools and universities, shops and restaurants, social distancing including wearing of
masks, and so-called national “lockdowns”, where people being prohibited from leaving
their home except for work and essential shopping. Further, during a lockdown, all nonessential shops are closed and public gatherings of people not from the same household
are forbidden [1].
While lockdowns in particular have had a strong reduction effect on the infection
numbers, they come with severe social and economic repercussions. Stopping people
from leaving their homes and interacting with others face-to-face can lead to a decline
in physical and mental health, while whole industries such as the hospitality industry
have recorded extreme losses in the months since March 2020 [9]. Since the first wave
of lockdowns and severe restrictions in March, April and May, governments have been
trying to find a way to keep infection numbers small while keeping the economy strong
and enabling people to live in a quasi-normal way. This has proven to be a difficult task,
mainly since it involves different conflicting objectives, e.g., keep the public acceptance
for the restrictions high, and stop the economy from stalling, while slowing the spreading
and preventing the health care systems from becoming overwhelmed.
It would be useful to have a way of computing which combination of government
restrictions and policies (from here on called ”counter-measures”) form optimal compromises between the conflicting objectives. To do this, the relationship between countermeasures and their effect on the infection behavior has to be predicted, in particular for
combinations of counter-measures that have not been tried in reality yet or are hard to
implement. Because in most countries several measures were implemented at once, it is
difficult to guess their individual effects. Based on accurate prediction one would be able
to approximate the Pareto set [23] of Pareto optimal points with respect to the conflicting
objectives. While being possible in principle, such an endeavor would require accurate and
easily computable prediction schemes for all possible combinations of counter-measures.
Based on these, one could approximate the Pareto set via available techniques for multiobjective optimization [8].
For accurate prediction of counter-measures, in particular also for combinations that
have never been tried in reality, so-called agent-based models have been proposed that
permit modelling the infection spreading on the basis of the spatio-temporal interaction of
individuals (“agents”) with realistic mobility and behavioral patterns. Several such ABM
have been described in the literature, recently specifically for the spread of Covid-19, e.g.,
[24] and [15].
In this paper, we report on an agent-based mobility model for Berlin, that has been
developed based on recent publications on the mechanism of Covid-19 spreading, and

allows to simulate the dynamics of the infection spreading in the city of Berlin on a microlevel (see [24]). With this model (called the “ABM” from here on) the infection numbers
of, e.g., exposed, contagious, symptomatic and hospitalized patients, can be predicted
for all measures individually and accurately. However, the ABM is computationally very
expensive since in every single time step the interaction of several 100.000 agents has to
be computed. This very high computational effort prevents the use of the ABM as the
prediction core of a multi-objective optimization scheme.
Therefore, we have developed an accompanying macro-model based on differential
equations (called the “ODE model” subsequently) that uses the ABM results to approximate the change in the infection behavior for different counter-measures. Computationally, the ODE model is computationally cheap and can thus serve as the prediction core
for computing the Pareto sets wrt. a set of conflicting objectives.
We will discuss below, whether the prediction quality of the ODE model is sufficient
for this task. To this end, we will first demonstrate that the ODE model is able to
reproduce the data coming from real-world observations of the Covid-19 pandemics, as well
as for simulation data originating from the ABM, after appropriate parameter estimation.
The ODE model contains 10 kinetic parameters, some of them being related to the basic
properties of Covid-19 (like the typical time of showing symptoms or the hospitalization
rate) and others depending on the counter-measures in effect (like the average infection
rate). We observe that only the latter parameters do change if the ODE model is fitted
to data simulating different counter-measure combinations.
Next, we approximate the change of these parameters if the underlying combinations
of counter-measures are changed. That is, we consider the ODE parameters as functions
on the counter-measure space (that is, the abstract space of all possible counter-measure
combinations). By learning this function from data, the ODE model is turned into a
“stand-alone” model that can be run for all possible combinations of counter-measures
without the requirement to fit it to appropriate data first. This then allows for the
predictive use of the stand-alone ODE model for different counter-measure schemes and
its validation in comparison to the ABM model.
In the final step, we demonstrate how to compute Pareto sets of combinations of
counter-measures that form optimal compromises between the conflicting objectives that
often seem confusing in finding the best strategy, e.g. for decision makers. To this end,
we formulate the respective multi-objective optimization problem, and show how to solve
it numerically for a realistic test case. We also discuss the meaning of the results, in
particular the meaning of the Pareto set for decision makers.
The novelty of this article lies in the following triad:
(A) Construct a micro-model that can be used to describe all counter-measures under
consideration explicitly and in detail and can be fitted to real-world spreading data,

(B) use this micro-model to find a family of macro-models (ideally a single stand-alone
ODE model with counter-measure depending parameters) that is able to predict the
epidemic spread under all possible combinations of counter-measures, and
(c) use this macro-model as the prediction core within the multi-objective optimization
problem with conflicting spread-reduction and socio-economic objectives and solve
it numerically, i.e., compute the respective Pareto front.
We do not claim that the macro- or micro-model nor the Pareto strategy presented in
this article are the best possible or without alternatives. We only claim the novelty of the
combined strategy (A)-(C). Recent literature contains a variety of approaches on optimal
control of Covid-19 spreading, see, e.g., [19,22,26,29], with the underlying idea being even
older and more general [14]. Some parts from these approaches could also be included
in the framework presented in this paper, however, we focus on our core ideas for now
to make clear where the novelty lies. Further, these other approaches do not contain a
micro-model level and describe the consequences of counter-measures rather implicitly
by external controls on the ODE level without explicit representation on a micro-level.
Moreover, they do not consider the multi-objective perspective. We found a single multiobjective approach [40] (that claims to be the very first multi-objective one), which also
does not contain a micro-level and thus represents counter-measures implicitly without
being validated against real-world data.
The main goal of this article is to demonstrate that the realization of the combined
strategy (A)-(C) and the subsequent derivation of political options for action is practically
possible, if micro- and macro-model as well as a mathematical definition of the different
objectives can be tailored to the specific situation.

Micro model: Agent-based model (ABM)

The ABM proposed in [24, 25] models the population of Berlin (approximately 5 million
people, 3.6 of which are living inside the city limits) moving about their day, meeting other
agents at work, in school, in public transport, at leisure activities or when shopping. The
mobility side of the model had been worked on for many years before the outbreak of
SARS-CoV-19 and is based on mobile data [33]. The ABM assumes that an infection
may occur when an infectious and a susceptible agent are in the same building or vehicle
simultaneously.

2.1

Basic Structure

As stated above, the ABM takes the contact model from transport modelling. The transport model in question is activity-based, meaning that it contains complete daily activity

chains for every agent. These activities have types (for example home, work, leisure,
shop), durations and locations. The activity chains are available for a typical weekday,
a typical Saturday and a typical Sunday. This means that for every simulated week the
weekday model is run five times and then the Saturday and Sunday models are run.
If a contagious agent and a susceptible agent have contact, then the probability of
an infection depends on certain factors which are described in Eq. (1). The simulation
progresses by discrete timesteps in time t. In each step, the probability for agent n to
become infected at time t is described by [34, 35]
!
p(inf ect|contact) = 1 − exp −Θ

shm,t · cinm,t · inn,t · τnm,t

(1)

m

Here m is the sum over all agents, sh the viral shedding of the infectious agent, in
the intake, τ the duration of the contact, ci the contact intensity and Θ an overall scaling
parameter. sh and in can be reduced by wearing a mask, the ci depends on the room
size and air exchange and τ comes directly from the mobility model [25]. All parameters
are chosen based on the corresponding literature, and the model is tuned to real-world
data, mostly via its single scaling parameter Θ, and to a lesser extent by increasing model
detail, for example by including mobility data or outside temperatures, every time when
the ever longer case number trajectory can no longer be explained.
Aggregation Every single agent gets a certain infection state, e.g., it is either infected
or it is not. Aggregation of all infected agents forms a subgroup. As was hinted at earlier,
the infected people are later split into further groups: the exposed, the contagious, the
people showing symptoms, the seriously sick and the patients in the ICU. Additionally,
one may be interested in the group of the recovered. It is assumed that recovered people
are immune. By aggregation, the ABM gives the numbers of people in each group for
every day, usually starting in mid-February.
Mobility patterns and parametrization The ABM is strongly data-driven. This
section gives a short overview. For details see [25].
• The disease progression model is taken directly from literature and all state transitions follow log normal distributions. The probabilities of requiring hospital or
intensive care are age-dependent.
• The disease import from abroad is taken from data publicly provided by the Robert
Koch Institute (RKI), the German public agency responsible for collecting this kind
of data. This is significant, because the number of imported cases vary strongly
depending on the date.

• Since the pandemic started, people decided to reduce some activities or were forced
to reduce them due to restrictions. These activity reductions are included in the
ABM and are based on mobile phone data.
• In the ABM agents can wear masks depending on the activity types. As the wearing
of masks is obligatory in Berlin when shopping and in public transport vehicles this
is also included into the model. The compliance rates over time are provided by the
local transport company in Berlin (BVG).
• The ABM distinguishes between indoor and outdoor activities. It models the effects
of seasonality by assuming that in summer more leisure activities take place outdoors
than in winter. If an encounter takes place outdoors, the infection probability is
reduced by a factor of 10 compared to the same situation indoors.
• Contact tracing is implemented by putting the contacts of agents that show symptoms into quarantine. The contact tracing is capacity-restricted, meaning that it
can only be carried out for a certain number of daily cases. This models that contact
tracing can only work effectively when case numbers are low.

2.2

Expectation values

Each single ABM simulation is an individual realization of a random process. Therefore,
single simulations are of very limited importance. Instead, expectation values over all
possible realizations have to be considered. More precisely, assume we consider a vector
of d observables x ∈ Rd (e.g., for d = 5, the aggregated number of exposed, the contagious,
the people showing symptoms, the seriously sick and the patients in the ICU), then every
random ABM simulation yields x(t), the respective evolution of the respective numbers
in time t. The corresponding time-dependent expectation value is denoted
hXi(t, x0 ) = E(x(t)|x(0) = x0 ),
where x(0) = x0 indicates that all realizations start from the same initial state x0 . Its
representation as the average over all possible realization implies that hXi can be approximated by the running average over a large enough number m of independent realizations

Simulation protocol Each ABM simulation is composed of many individual realizations of the stochastic ABM. Each single one is initialized such that the ensemble of agents
can be taken as a realistic synthetic population and such that the respective state of the
infection process (including hospitalization etc) is correctly represented.

2.3

2.3 Counter-measure space

Counter-measure space

The ABM is flexible enough to model a large variety of counter-measures, ranging from
mask wearing (reduced infection probability if more agents wear masks more often) via
school closures (changing mobility patterns) to contact tracing procedures (sending agents
into self-isolation or quarantine, if exposed). Each single counter-measure i can have a
weight ci between ci = 0 and ci = 1, representing the strictness of rules and their impact.
For example, if i represents wearing masks then ci = 0 means that no-one is wearing them
and ci = 1 means that everyone is wearing a mask all the time.
When measures i = 1, . . . , M are considered, every possible combination of countermeasures can be encoded in the counter-measure state c ∈ [0, 1]M = C, where C is called
the counter-measure space. It is important to note that the ABM, if appropriately tuned,
allows to perform simulations for all possible states of the counter-measure space. In order
to indicate the dependence of ABM simulation results on the respective counter-measure
state c ∈ C, we subsequently write respective expectation values by hXi(t, x0 |c).

2.4

Validation

The ABM was first fitted to real-world data from Berlin starting February 16, 2020.
Figure 1 shows the aggregated simulation results in comparison to real-world observation
data published by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), we see that the aforementioned
parameters lead to a simulation result that well reflects the structure of the real data,
cf. [30].

We see that the ABM simulation data reproduces all qualitative trends of the realworld data. In the specific single simulation run shown in Figure 1, the number of people
showing symptoms lies above the observed numbers. This is a typical scenario that reflects
that not all symptomatic individuals will be recorded by official statistics such that the
reported number of symptomatic individuals is slightly under-estimated, cf. [30].

2.5

Numerical Experiments: Covid-19 spreading in Berlin

For the sake of simplicity, we only consider three different types of counter-measures
(M = 3) in this article: school closures, mask compliance and contact tracing. In the
following, c1 = 0 means that schools are open without any restrictions, and c1 = 1 means
that they are completely closed and all classes are online, c2 = 0 means that no-one is
wearing masks and c2 = 1 means that everyone if earing a mask all the time, c3 = γ
means that contract tracing is done for 100 · γ percent of the detected infection cases.
Simulation data for different counter-measures The ABM model fitted to realworld data from Berlin for March 01 to October 27, 2020, was used to predict the infection
process up to November 30, 2020, for the following combinations of measures for us:
• 0, 50, 100 % school closures
• 0, 50, 100 % mask compliance
• 0, 50, 100 % contact tracing.
This results in 27 different ABM simulation data sets, given as time-series of running
averages given by (2) for the aggregation subgroups of interest (given by the compartments
required by the ODE model, see below).

Macro model: Differential equations model (ODE)

A simple model to simulate the spread of infectious diseases such as Covid-19 is the
so-called SIRD model (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered, Deceased ) [13]. This model
separates the population of a city/state/country into four disjoint groups: Everyone in a
population who has not yet been infected by the virus is still susceptible to it and is in
group S. At the beginning of the pandemic, this was everyone but the first people who
got infected (as of yet, it is not clear where the first infections occurred).
From group S, people move into the group of the infectious, I, with a certain rate.
They are also infectious now. The size of this group is important: the more people are
already infected, the easier it is for everyone in group S to become infected as well. From
group I, people can either move into group R if they have recovered from the virus or
into group D if they have died.

with kE the infection rate, kR the recovery rate and kD the mortality rate.
Because it is so simple, the model has obvious disadvantages, e.g. what about the
people who have already been infected but are not infectious themselves yet, or what if
the people who are recovered are not actually immune and should be put into the S group
once more?
There is a variety of ODE models for describing Covid-19 spreading, many of them
built on the idea behind the SIRD model but extending it by adding categories, e.g.,
[19, 22, 26, 29, 40], or by considering other compartmental variants [27]. Other approaches
utilize delay differential equations (DDE) [11] or stochastic models, either in the form
of stochastic differential equations [41], in discrete form [16] or by probabilistic means
[12]. The relation between ABMs and SIRD-like ODE, SDE or DDE models has been
discussed from many angles. General results show that the ABM expectation values
converge to solutions of respective ODE or SDE models or respective partial differential
versions for spatially resolved ABMs when the number of agents is made sufficiently large
[17, 37]. However, this condition will not be satisfied in all stages of epidemic spread,
especially not in all aggregate classes. Moreover, the theory requires a specific scaling of
the stochastic ingredients of the ABM in order to allow for explicit formulas for the ODE
and its parameters (which normally will not be available). Therefore, we know that ODE
models in general provide appropriate macro-models for ABM micro-models but still need
to find ways to fit the macro-model to the specific ABM model at hand.

3.1

Description of our ODE model

In order to construct an appropriate ODE model for our purpose, we will extend the
basic SIRD model by introducing additional compartments. Our new model will take
into account individuals that are exposed, symptomatic, in quarantine and in hospital.
A graphical representation of compartments in our model and their relations is shown in
Fig. 2. We introduce the following new compartments:
• Exposed E: refers to the group of people who have been infected with the virus,
but are not infectious themselves yet. After an incubation time, individuals from

E become infectious and automatically move into group I, so in this model it is
assumed that individuals do not recover without becoming contagious. A switch
from E to I happens with a rate kI .
• Symptomatic SY : for individuals who are showing symptoms. Infected individuals become symptomatic with a rate kSY . Differentiating between the groups of
infectious I and symptomatic SY individuals is important because it can help in
finding undetected cases. In principle, it is more likely that people who are showing
symptoms get tested and thus appear in statistics.
• Hospitalized H and critical C: refer to patients in hospitals and individuals
in critical condition that are in the intensive care unit. We assume that a certain
number of people in SY recover and directly transit to the recovered compartment
R. However, the rest is moved into the hospital compartment with a rate kH and
from there, if they recover they go into group R or if they are critical they move

go either to R or D. Please note that the model assumes that people who die from
an infection with Covid-19 have been showing symptoms, then were taken to the
hospital and into the ICU, i.e. there is now no other way to reach group D except

3.1 Description of our ODE model
from a compartment of critical patients.
• Quarantine QS and Self-isolation QE , QI : for individuals that are separated
from others by either quarantine or self-isolation. Susceptible individuals who are
suspected to have become infected (e.g. by a close contact to a confirmed case)
go to quarantine QS with a rate kQ . From quarantine, one can go back into the
compartment S with a rate kS , as QS refers to individuals that were not infected and
quarantine ”in vain”. Exposed individuals E and infectious individuals I go to selfisolation with a rate kQ , i.e. to compartments QE and QI , respectively. Similarly
to the case of E → I, we also introduce QE → QI with a rate kI , when self-isolated
individuals start to be infectious. Finally, from QI possible transitions are either to
recovery R or to SY if symptoms start to appear. These three compartments are
necessary to model the effects of contact tracing and related counter-measures.

Thus, the total population is divided into 11 different compartments: susceptible
S, quarantined QS , exposed E, non-infectious self-isolated QE , infectious I, infectious
self-isolated QI , symptomatic SY , hospitalized H, critical C, deceased D and recovered
R. The final model can be described using differential equations, in the following way:

The ODE model contains the following model parameters:
• the infection rate kE
• the rate of becoming infectious kI

• the rate of showing symptoms kSY
• the rate of being hospitalized kH
• the rate of becoming a critical patient kC
• the rate of recovering kR
• the rate of mortality kD
• the rate of going into self-isolation/quarantine kQ
• the rate of going out of quarantine kS .
Most of these ODE parameters are dependent on the virus itself and not on any
non-pharmaceutical interventions: for example, the rate of being hospitalized should not
depend on school closures, but should stay the same no matter the government measures.
The only two parameters that should change depending on the measures are the infection
rate kE and the parameter kQ . The latter depends on how well the contact tracing is
working. Contact tracing usually means the following process: if a person tests positive,
they state all the people they have been in contact with over a certain time period.
These people are alerted (either by the national health services or by a contact tracing
app). If they have been in close contact with the infected person (e.g. by having a long
conversation with them or sitting next to them for hours at work), they will be required
to quarantine and possibly get tested. If the interaction was not long enough or they kept
their distance, they are usually advised to monitor their health and quarantine if they
develop any symptoms [3]. Contact tracing is a very effective measure in containing the
spread of the virus, but, as has also been worked out in [21, 24], it stops working once the
number of cases becomes too high (because health services cannot trace back all contacts
anymore). In order to include the effect of contact tracing, we set that
kQ = kq nCT

CT
,
N

where kq is the rate of people going into quarantine after being called by the contact
tracing agency (kq = 10.25 independent of counter-measures), nCT is the number of
people going to self-isolation/quarantine per symptomatic person (a parameter dependent
on the effectiveness of the contract tracing agency), and CT = CT (t) is the number of
positively tested individuals presently processed by the contract tracing agency. This
number is changing with time according to

3.2 Parameter Estimation

with an inflowing rate given by the number of infected individuals that become symptomatic per unit of time and an outgoing rate with which individuals presently processed
by contract tracing go into self-isolation/quarantine and are no longer processed. The
number CT can approximately be taken as the number of positively tested individuals
that are not already quarantined/isolated.
Since kq is fixed, we have to consider either kQ or nCT as free parameter. Since
the definition of kQ is more involved, we decide to give this role to nCT . Additionally,
comparable to kq , the parameter kS turns out to be independent of counter-measures and
can be fixed to kS = 0.192 for all further investigations. Therefore, we will subsequently
call the vector k = (kE , kI , kSY , kH , kC , kR , kD , nCT ) the ODE parameters; all possible
values of the ODE parameters come from the parameter space P. The ODE model itself
will be denoted
dx
= F (x, k), x(0) = x0 ,
(6)
dt
where x = (S, E, I, SY , H, C, D, R, QS , QE , QI , CT ) ∈ X denotes the state vector of all
the observables appearing in (4) and (5), and k ∈ P the respective ODE parameters. The
resulting solution of the ODE model is denoted x(t, x0 , k) for t ∈ [0, T ].

3.2

Parameter Estimation

Parameter estimation (PE) means the process of fitting the ODE model to given data.
More precisely, one distinguishes between the forward and the backward problem. Generating trajectory data by numerically solving (6) with known ODE parameters is called
the forward problem. The backward problem is the reverse: the data is known but the
parameters are not. This is the case here: There is (observation or simulation) data of
the spread of the virus; let us denote it by X(t) ∈ X , t ∈ T , where T is the set of discrete
times at which the infection state x has been observed. We want to find the ODE parameters for which the ODE solution x(t, x0 , k) is closest to the given data X(t) at all time
point t ∈ T . In PE for ODEs, closeness is typically measured by means of the relative
total residual R. The residual depends on the weighted least squares,
L(x(·, x0 , k), X(·)) =

The relative total residual can be defined as the ”relative deviation between experiment

resulting in a non-linear least squares problem. Subsequently, this minimization problem
is numerically solved using PREDICI [39]. It uses a Gauss-Newton method with damping
and reduced directions.
Gauss-Newton method and correlated parameters. The Gauss-Newton algorithm
is a kind of Newton’s method applied to the first derivative of the vector-valued function
L = L(k) describing the model-data difference, where its jth component, Lj (k), is given
by the j summand in sum in equation (7), j = 1, . . . , d|T |. The key element of the
Gauss-Newton method is the rectangular Jacobian matrix A of L,
Aj,i (k) =

∂Lj (k)
∂ki

j = 1, . . . , d|T |,

i = 1, . . . , dim(P).

We start with an initial guess for the parameter vector k 0 for the parameters and compute
iteratively, using the generalized inverse of the Jacobian,
A(k ` )∆k ` = −L(k ` ),

` = 0, 1, . . . ,

(9)

and update the parameter vector due to k `+1 := k ` + λ` · ∆k ` , where the damping factor
λ` ≤ 1 is adjusted in each step to ensure improvement of the objective function L.
In many realistic cases, the linear problem (9) is numerically ill-conditioned. The
reason for this is that the Jacobian A exhibits very small singular values in the vicinity of
the solution. These small singular values mean that some of the parameters, say ki and
kj , are correlated. This correlation has the effect that L hardly changes if one changes ki
and kj in a concerted way. Effectively, this means that changes in ki can be compensated
by changes in kj without ever changing the functional L significantly. The Gauss-Newton
algorithm used in PREDICI includes a technique that detects parameter correlations
during the iteration process and transforms them accordingly. We will see that such
correlations are happening when performing parameter estimation for our ODE model
which is the main reason why we apply PREDICI herein.
It can be shown that the Gauss-Newton method will converge to a local minimum of
the residual function. This local minimum is the global one, if a number of conditions are
met, one of which is that the initial parameter values must not be too far away from their
optimal values: a good first guess of the parameters is crucial to achieving good results
in the parameter estimation. Further description of parameter estimation, the underlying
minimization problem and its numerical solution as well as the conditions under which it

3.3

Numerical Experiments

Next, we will discuss whether the ODE model is appropriate to allow for reasonably
good fit to real-world observation data as well as to ABM simulation data for different
counter-measures.
Fitting the ODE model to observation data In order to test how well the ODE
model can reproduce real-life data, we will use a set of data for the State of Berlin,
including the cumulative numbers of positive tests, the number of hospital beds that are
occupied by Covid-19 patients, the number of ICU beds that are occupied by Covid-19
patients and the cumulative number of people who have died after a Covid-19 infection.
These data are officially available from March 1 to the moment our experiments were
performed, November 5, 2020, through websites fed by the authorities of the State of
Berlin. Our model does not have an explicit group that represents positive tests. We
identified the group of the symptomatic infected with the group of the positively tested.
Important here: The infection rate kE has to be somewhat time-dependent for reallife data because the infection rate is dependent on the current counter-measures that are
in place. In reality, measures and restrictions to prevent the spread of Covid-19 do not
come into action all at the same time but are introduced (and lifted) gradually. Sometimes
it is only their strength that is varied. If we only have one parameter representing the
measures for the complete time span we are looking at, the model will fail to fit real-life
data.
So in order for the model to have a chance at fitting the real-life data well, we allow
the infection rates to vary with time:

The parameter kSY is time-dependent in the same way. This is necessary because we equal
the number of positive tests to the number of people showing symptoms. The parameter
kSY works as a testing rate and the number of tests have changed significantly over time.
For fitting the ODE model, we use the real-life data from May 18 until October 26,
2020. The data starts at the end of the ”first wave” in May, so well before the second
wave started taking effect in the fall of 2020. For this period, the parameter estimation
scheme introduced above was applied and the resulting optimal parameter values were

used subsequently to compute predictions for the infection dynamics beyond October 26,
2020.
The data from October 27 to November 5 (the specific date the numerical experiments were made) were taken as test data for validation of the prediction quality of the
model. The result of the optimal fit and resulting prediction/validation is shown in Fig. 3.
We observe that the optimally fitted ODE model reproduces the real-world data quite
well and yields very good prediction quality.

persons (bottom, right). Green dots: Real-life data used for fitting the ODE model. Blue

Fitting the ODE model to ABM simulation data Next, instead of using reallife data to fit the ODE, we use simulation data coming directly from the ABM. This
data consists of time-series of aggregated numbers (expectation values) for the model
compartments. The initial values are the corresponding real Berlin numbers on the 27th
October 2020. The ABM was used to simulate the change in these numbers for the next
5 weeks (until the end of November), assuming certain counter-measures (as outlined in
Sec. 2.5).
First, we consider the case where, starting on the 27th of October, all schools (=
kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, university, other education) are closed in

Berlin, everyone is wearing a surgical mask in public transport, in shops and at work,
and contact tracing works faultlessly in identifying each contact of a person that is symptomatic, which is associated with the counter-measure space c = (1, 1, 1) according to
Sec. 2.5. The ODE fit to this data set is shown in Figure 4. The residual was less than 2
%.

Figure 4: Optimal ODE fit for the ABM data simulating 100 % school closures, 100 %
mask compliance and 100 % contact tracing.
Next, consider c = (0, 0, 0) starting on October 27 (all schools are open, nobody is
wearing masks, no contact tracing is done). Then the ABM simulation data looks quite
different, and still the ODE can fit the data nicely, as can be seen in Figure 5.
If we now take a look at the respective optimal ODE parameters as listed in Table
1, we see that except for the infection rate kE and the contract tracing parameter nCT
the parameters are roughly the same for both cases.
This is exactly what we had hoped to see: a change in the counter-measures should
not affect the rate of showing symptoms or of being hospitalized but only the rate with
which people are infected.
Projection onto one parameter. Now, since it seems that the different kinds of
counter-measures affect only the two parameters kE and nCT significantly, the idea is to
use them to fit all different kinds of counter-measure data sets. The rest of the parameters
are fixed to their optimal values for a ”base case”, i.e. no counter-measures are in effect.
Consider the examples of different counter-measures and the corresponding parameter

combinations shown in Table 2. We first observe that the parameters do not behave
monotonically, i.e., the infection rate does not automatically drop when the measures
become stricter. Also, the parameter values for nCT should be close to 0 for the countermeasure combinations without contact tracing but they are not. It seems that nCT
”absorbs” some of kE ’s meaning. This is exactly the scenario of correlated parameters
explained in Sec. 3.2: changes in kE can be compensated by changes in nCT without
ever changing the residual function significantly. Therefore, in the following we remove
this correlation by fitting kE only, while nCT is fixed which effectively means to assume a
capacity limit for the contact tracing per day (which makes the model even more realistic).

This way, the counter-measure effect of the contact tracing is not visible in the parameter
nCT anymore but solely in kE , cf. Table 3 below.

Table 2: Optimal parameters kE and nCT for different counter-measure combinations

With this idea, we fit the base case c = (0, 0, 0) using all parameters again, fix all
of them except for kE and compute the optimal fit to the case c = (1, 1, 1) using only kE .
The result is shown in Fig. 6. While the fit is not as good as it was when all parameters
were fitted, the residual here is less than 3 %, so still very small.

Figure 6: The ODE fit for the ABM data simulating 100 % school closures, 100 % mask
compliance and 100 % contact tracing. This time, only kE was used to fit the data.
Now, when changing the counter-measure state c the optimal parameter value of kE
does decrease monotonically with stricter measures, as can be seen in Table 3.

Stand-alone ODE model

In principle, the ABM simulation can be performed for all states in the counter-measure
space C (keeping in mind that each simulation causes considerable computational effort).
We perform such simulations for N counter-measure states ci ∈ C, i = 1, . . . , N , e.g. from
a grid discretization of C. Then we use PE to fit the ODE model to this simulation data,
i.e., find optimal ODE parameters k∗ (ci ), and learn a function K : C → P from this
parameter data. For unknown counter-measure states c0 , we then use the ODE model

hXi(t|ci ).
B. Fitting the ODE model to the ABM training data: For each counter-measure
combination ci , fit the ODE model to the simulation data hXi(t|ci ) using the

C. Use nonlinear regression to find an optimal fit function K : C → P on countermeasure space C to the data k∗ (ci ), i = 1, . . . , N .

values of these simulations on the observable space X by hXi(t|ci ).

3.4 Stand-alone ODE model

Remark: The number N + N 0 of required independent sets of ABM simulation data
must not be too large because of limitations of available computational capacities. In
particular, this means that for dimensions of the counter-measure space larger than 3
or 4 one needs to resort to sparse grids or quasi Monte-Carlo methods for choosing the
counter-measures states in Step A.
In the context of the infection spreading in Berlin described above, these five steps
can be realized as follows.
Step A: ABM testing data. We put this procedure to practice following the scheme
described in Sec 2.5. The ABM is first tuned to real-world data from Berlin. Then, starting on October 27, three of the counter-measures are varied in strength: the percentage
of schools that are closed; percentage of people who are wearing surgical masks; and the
probability that contact tracing is successful. These three counter-measures are adjusted
to 0, 50 and 100 % respectively, resulting in 27 different measure combinations that define
a uniform grid in counter-measure space, ci1 ,i2 ,i3 = (i1 /2, i2 /2, i3 /2), i1 , i2 , i3 ∈ {0, 1, 2}.
These grid points are used for step (1) in our procedure for defining the stand-alone ODE.
Please note: Because 100 % successful contact tracing is highly unlikely (practically
impossible), we assume that 60 % successful contact tracing is the best we can hope for
and is represented by c3 = 1.
Between the most strict set of measures (100 % of schools are closed, everyone is
wearing a mask, contact tracing works faultlessly) and the most loose measure set (0 %
for all three measures), the simulations show a large difference in the numbers in the
projections for the hospital numbers for November (see Figure 7).
Step B: Fitting the ODE model. Next, following step (2) in our procedure, we fit
the ODE to all of these 27 data sets. Again, we only need to use the infection rate kE
to fit all 27 data sets while fixing the rest of the parameters to a value coming from the
optimal fit of a so-called ”base case”, in our case the data set with the lowest measures
(C = (0, 0, 0)). For all 27 data sets, the resulting residuals are very small (less than 5 %).
The parameter values that were used can be found in Table 4, except for kE and nCT .
The latter one was fixed to the value of 60, which gave the best results.
Step C: Regression on counter-measure space. Until now, we got the values
kE (ci1 ,i2 ,i3 ) for all grid points ci1 ,i2 ,i3 = (i1 /2, i2 /2, i3 /2), i1 , i2 , i3 ∈ {0, 1, 2} in countermeasure space. Next, we will predict the value of kE for unknown c, without using new
and computationally very expensive ABM simulations. To do this, we use polynomial
regression to express the function as a polynomial of low degree by computing its coefficients. The polynomial regression is done using the sklearn package in Python. As an
example, a three-dimensional (i.e. three input values) polynomial of degree 3 has the

regression model has 20 parameters (19 coefficients plus the intercept). For a polynomial
of degree 2 the three sums on the right hand side are omitted.
In the case considered herein, polynomial regression works exceptionally well for a
polynomial of degree 2 for kE . We tried three different polynomials, one with degree 2,
one with degree 3 and one with degree 4. The respective relative error (compared with
the training label sets) are 0.00058, 0.00028 and 0.00017. As can be seen in Figure 8,

3.5 Predictions using the stand-alone ODE model

even though the fit is better for a higher-degree polynomial, the error reduction with
higher degree does not weigh up the disadvantages of having many more parameters in
the regression function which often leads to overfitting on the training set. Therefore, we
choose to keep the function with a 2-degree polynomial.

Figure 8: Polynomial regression function for kE with different degrees. The plots show
the result when polynomials of degree 2, 3, or 4, respectively, are used. The accuracy
does not improve significantly if a higher degree than 2 is used.

Steps D and E: Test data and validation. Next, we first generate ABM testing
data for the counter-measure states c = (z/100, 0.5, 0.5) (”Schools”), c = (0.5, z/100, 0.5)
(”Masks”) and c = (0.5, 0.5, z/100) (”CT”) with z = 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80, 90. We
compute the value of kE using the regression function. Afterwards, we insert the resulting
values into the ODE model and compute the residual between the ODE model output
and the ABM data set. The resulting residuals can be found in Table 5. The largest
residual for the validation set is 0.065. This is really acceptable.

3.5

Predictions using the stand-alone ODE model

Now that the regression results have been validated, we can use them to make predictions
on the effectiveness of counter-measure combinations. Consider the following examples.
Example 1. Using the regression results, we predict that the infection rate for the
counter-measure combination c = (0.99, 0.50, 0.59) should be kE = 0.936. In this scenario,

schools are almost completely closed.
Now, for the counter-measure combination c = (0.16, 0.50, 0.73), the infection rate kE =
0.936 as well. This means, given that we trust the regression results to a certain extent,
the effect of these two counter-measure combinations are the same. It also shows that the
effect of school closures are rather small in the ABM, which fits the current research that
says that schools are not driver of the pandemic, at least in Germany.
Example 2. As another example, the regression approximation of the infection rate
for c = (0.12, 0.15, 0.7) yields kE = 1. This is also the resulting infection rate for c =
(0.9, 0.9, 0.2). Again, we see that contact tracing compensates for a drastic reduction in
the number of schools closed and masks worn.
Now that we can approximate which counter-measure combinations lead to which
infection rate, we can tailor the optimal restriction response in order to achieve a certain
goal, for example to never exceed a certain number of hospitalized Covid-19 patients as
to not overwhelm hospitals in Berlin. There are certain measures that are seen to be
less intrusive in people’s daily lives and should thus be used preferentially, as long as
they lower the infection numbers sufficiently. In the first example above, we see that we
only need to use a bit more contact tracing to compensate for opening the schools almost
completely (16 % closed = 84 % open). This would then be seen as the preferred course
of action, as contact tracing does not affect society as much as closing schools (which in
turn leads to parents not being able to work etc.).

Optimal coordination of counter-measures

For an optimal coordination of counter-measures one first has to define the objectives
with respect to which optimality has to be judged. For the Covid-19 pandemic there will
be many such conflicting objectives: on the one hand, decreasing the number of infected,

or, at least, keeping the number of deaths minimal and the number of ICU beds below
a certain threshold given by the capacity of the health care system; on the other hand
minimizing socio-economic, political and/or health care system costs. Let us assume that
the relevant objectives can be modelled by a vector of n objective functions
J (x, c) = (J1 (x, c), . . . , Jn (x, c))T .
Additionally, we have to define the set of all feasible counter-measure schemes. A countermeasure scheme is a function C : [t1 , t2 ] → C that defines a counter-measure state for each
time t in the time interval [t1 , t2 ] in which we are looking for an optimal combination of
counter-measures. The feasible counter-measure schemes have to satisfy certain restrictions: one cannot switch too often between counter-measure states and between switches
the counter-measure state has to be constant. Let the set of feasible counter-measures be
denoted by C[t0 , t1 ].
The objective functions Jk (x, C) depend on the counter-measure scheme C : [t1 , t2 ] →
C and the associated infection dynamics x : [t1 , t2 ] → X , in general in the form
Z

t2

Jk (x, C) =

gk (x(t), C(t)) dt + hk (x(t2 ), C(t2 )),
t1

where the terminal cost function hk or the running cost gk may be zero. Then, an optimal
counter-measures scheme C∗ (t) ∈ C[t0 , t1 ] is given by a solution of the multi-objective
optimization problem
min J (x, C),
C∈C[t0 ,t1 ]

dx(t)
= F (x(t), K(C(t))),
dt

t ∈ [t1 , t2 ],

(12)

fitted to ABM simulation data in the time period [0, t1 ].
For the sake of simplicity of notation, we now write our optimization problem in the
following form:
min J (C),
C∈C

suppressing for the moment that C is a time-dependent function, or assuming that the
space C[t0 , t1 ] is a finite-dimensional function space.
In such a multi-objective optimization problem, there does not typically exist a
feasible counter-measure scheme that minimizes all objective functions simultaneously.
Therefore, one seeks to find Pareto optimal counter-measure schemes; that is, schemes
that cannot be improved in any of the objectives without degrading at least one of the
other objectives. Subsequently, we will write J (C) ≤p J (C 0 ) if Jk (C) ≤ Jk (C 0 ) for all

such that
J (C) 6= J (C̃), and J (C̃) ≤p J (C).
(13)
A counter-measure scheme C ∈ C is called (globally) Pareto-optimal if there does not
exist another scheme that Pareto-dominates it. The set of Pareto optimal schemes is
often called the Pareto front. According to [20], each Pareto-optimal scheme is a substationary scheme. A scheme C ∈ C is called sub-stationary if there is a sequence of

that

The condition in (14) means that the weighted objective (”compromise objective”)

has a local minimum at the sub-stationary scheme C. The set of sub-stationary schemes
C ∈ C typically forms a (n−1)-dimensional manifold in C which contains the Pareto front;
in this sense, the set of sub-stationary schemes represents all possible optimal compromises
(resulting from minimizing all Oα for α ∈ Wn ).

4.1

Numerical Experiments

In order to keep the numerical experiments simple, we consider only two objectives: the
number of symptomatic infected, and the socio-economic costs, quite over-simplifiedly
modelled by a linear function of c,
J (x, c) = (J1 (x, c), J2 (C)),

J1 (C) = 3c21 (t2 ) + 0.4c2 (t2 ) + 0.6c3 (t2 ),

J1 (x, C) = SY (t2 ),

where we chose to consider terminal costs at the end time t2 only. The choice of J1
means that the costs related to high percentages of school closures are estimated about
several times higher than that of high percentages of mask wearing and contract tracing.
Moreover, the costs related to contract tracing are estimated about 50% higher than those
of mask wearing.
Moreover, we define the set of feasible counter-measures by
C[t1 , t2 ] = {C : [t1 , t2 ] → C, C is constant within the period [t1 , t2 ]}.
Thus, C[t1 , t2 ] can be identified with [0, 1]3 .

4.1 Numerical Experiments

Numerical approximation of the Pareto front. Based on the theoretical insights
on Pareto sets and sub-stationary points outlined above, the authors of [10] propose a
multilevel subdivision technique that allows to find a numerical approximation of the
Pareto front, also cf. [32]. The main idea is that the solutions of the ordinary differential
equation
Ċ = −q(C)
(15)
asymptotically converge to sub-stationary schemes, where the function q is defined by
q(C) =

We utilized this algorithmic scheme by starting from a coarse uniform grid G on [0, 1]3 ,
selected all grid points for which condition (13) is satisfied within G, and used this as
a start box covering (”level 1”) of the Pareto set, which then was used to start the
subdivision algorithm based on the contraction mapping given by (15).
Figure 9 shows the resulting box coverings on level 1 and 3 of the subdivision process.
We observe that the Pareto front seems to form a straight line from about (0.1, 1, 0.6) to
(0.1, 0, 0.8), approximately. Fig. 10 shows the values of the two objectives plotted against
each other along this level 3 covering.

Figure 9: Box covering of Pareto front shown from two different perspectives. Only the
box centers are displayed (level 1 (blue dots) and level 3 (red dots)).
We see that c1 = 0.1 along the Pareto front, approximately, showing that the effect
of school closures on suppressing growing infection spread is limited according to the
model. Essentially, the Pareto front is spread from c2 = 0 to c2 = 1, while c1 only varies
from 0.6 to 0.8. This shows that the percentage of wearing masks is the main variable
if one wants to choose one point on the Pareto front, while, whatever is chosen wrt. to
masks, contract tracing always has to be quite extensive.

Figure 10: Values of the two objective functions J1 and J2 along the Pareto front displayed
in Fig. 9 plotted against each other.
Approximately given objective functions. In our case, we use the ODE model as
a surrogate for the (more accurate) ABM model. That is, the objective functions J` =
J` (x, C) are not given precisely but, through the approximate nature of x as the solution
of the stand-alone ODE, only in a somewhat perturbed form J˜` = J˜` (x, C). Therefore, we
should ask in which sense the Pareto front computed for J˜ = (J˜1 , . . . , J˜n ) approximates
the Pareto front of J = (J1 , . . . , Jn ). This important question is addressed in [28] for
the case that a complex micro-model is replaced by a surrogate model. The authors of
[28] show how to adapt the subdivision algorithm used above can to this situation by
introducing the concept of ε-perturbations into the definition of Pareto dominant points
for |J˜` − J` | ≤ ε` . We will not discuss this aspect herein further, mainly because it is
unclear how to estimate the ε` when replacing the ABM by the ODE model. This topic
requires significant further research.

4.2

Pareto front based policy decisions

Mathematically, we cannot decide which of the points on the Pareto front is superior
or preferable; they all share the unimprovability property of Pareto points: you cannot
improve a single objective without making the other ones worse. Any decision about the
selection of one of the Pareto points must be based on additional aspects and thus is
”political” in the following sense: the fact that there is a Pareto front with more than
just one point leaves freedom for policy decisions. By choosing one of the Pareto points,
the political decision makers execute this freedom wrt. choosing one of many optimal
compromises between the conflicting objectives.

In the example above, for example, the specific form of the Pareto front tells us that
one is free to decide about the percentage of mask compliance, while there is no freedom
regarding the level of school closures, where the percentage of about 10% is given by
the Pareto front as optimal. The choice regarding the strength of contact tracing is also
limited to between 60 and 80 percent (but only in accordance with the choice for mask
compliance.

Discussion

Micro-level models of epidemic spreading processes allow for the realistic combination
of models for person-centric data-driven human mobility and behavior, stochastic infection models and person-centric disease progression models with governmental intervention
strategies. This allows detailed simulations of the societal transmission from government
actions to mobility behavior to infection dynamics. Therefore, they in principle would
be the perfect basis for predicting the outcome of all possible intervention strategies and
then optimize certain objectives over them.
Such micro-level models, however, are much too complex (computationally demanding) to allow for direct integration to multi-level optimization algorithms. Therefore, we
demonstrated how to construct a macro-model as a surrogate for the macro-model, in
the sense that the macro-model can be fitted to approximately reproduce the dynamical
behavior of the micro-model for all intervention strategies (=combination of countermeasures) of interest. Then, using the macro-model in the inner core of a multi-objective
optimization solver allows to compute the Pareto front of optimal compromises between
the objectives of interest.
By this strategy, considering the control of the spreading of the diseases as an
optimization problem can help governments choose strategies that prevent the disease
outbreak as well as limit economic damage.
The results presented in this article demonstrate that this strategy can be realized
theoretically and practically but they do not solve all immanent problems. Several important aspects need significant refinement and extended future research. For example, (1)
the mathematical formalization of the objective functions modeling the socio-economic
and health system costs is naive and has to be refined based on extended non-mathematical
expertise, (2) if specific considerations of age or other social aspects in the population or
specific test strategies are required, the ODE model must (and can) be extended, (3)
the approach can be extended into a network model by taking the exchange with other
regions with a different infection scenario into account, (4) the algorithm used for solving
the multi-objective optimization problem must be developed further in order to be able
to handle more complicated problems.
In conclusion, the present article lays the groundwork for simulation-based real-world
