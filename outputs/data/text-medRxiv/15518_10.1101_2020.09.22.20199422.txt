ABSTRACT
The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 22 million cases and caused
immense burdens on governments and healthcare systems worldwide. Since its
emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on ways to not only treat
the infected but also identify those at risk and prevent spread. There is currently no
known biological biomarker that can predict the risk of being infected. A growing set
of studies have emerged that show an association between ABO blood group and the
risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in
Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection
as well as susceptibility to a more severe ICU-requiring infection. We found that
individuals with blood group B were at a higher risk of infection, while those with blood
group AB were at a lower risk. No association was observed between blood group and
the risk of a severe ICU-requiring COVID-19 infection. We extended the analysis to
study the association by antibodies present; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b
(blood groups A and O). Antibodies were not found to be associated with either risk of
infection or susceptibility to severe infection. The current study, along with the variation
in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be the most
ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing
the current COVID-19 pandemic, has led to over 22 million cases and 788,000 deaths
worldwide (1). The rapid spread of the disease has inflicted immense strains on
healthcare and testing resources, and identifying individuals most at risk is critical to
managing the pandemic. There is currently no known biological biomarker that can
predict the risk of being infected. Several studies have emerged showing an
association between ABO blood types and the risk of COVID-19 infection. This is not
unlikely, as many studies previously suggested associations between blood group and
other diseases and infections, including SARS-CoV-1 (2-4). This observation was first
reported by Zhao et al. for SARS-Cov-2, with blood group A showing a higher risk of
COVID-19 infection and mortality, and blood group O showing a decreased risk (5).
These findings have been replicated in several other reports (6-9). Further analysis of
this data was conducted by antibodies, classifying blood groups as anti-A (blood
groups B and O) and anti-B (blood groups A and O), and suggested that anti-A
antibodies are less associated with COVID-19 (10). However, a recent article by Latz
et al. reports contradicting observations, where higher risk of infection was observed
for individuals of blood group B instead of A (11). This recent contradiction to the
literature has added ambiguity to the field. Hence, our objective is to identify whether
the risk of COVID-19 infection and severity of clinical outcomes are associated with
ABO blood groups and antibodies.
METHODS
1. Study Design
In this cross-sectional observational study, we investigated the association between
blood group and risk of COVID-19 infection and severity of clinical outcomes.
Association was analyzed by ABO blood group and blood antibody class. To study
effect of blood group on susceptibility of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the distribution of
blood types amongst a sample of confirmed COVID-19 individuals in Bahrain were
compared to the distribution of blood types amongst the general population of Bahrain.
To study the effect of blood type on the severity of clinical outcomes, the distribution

of blood types were compared between COVID-19 individuals who were admitted to
an intensive care unit (ICU) and those of the general COVID-19 patients sample. This
was replicated in the analysis by antibody class, with blood groups being grouped as
anti-A (blood groups B and O), and anti-B (blood groups A and O).
2. Data collection
A confirmed COVID-19 case was any individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2
via a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the NP sample was
tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using the E gene as a target. If
the E gene was detected, the sample was confirmed by a PCR test targeting RdRp.
All confirmed cases tested positive for the E gene and the RdRp using real time PCR
from Roche and Invitrogen kits.
A random sample of 3000 COVID-19 positive individuals was chosen from the National
COVID-19 Database to represent the COVID-19 infected population. Of those, 2138
individuals had blood group data documented or obtainable, and hence included in
the study. As of 19 July 2020, there have been 196 COVID-19 cases with ICU
admissions, all of which were included in this study. Blood group data for all the
COVID-19 infected individuals were obtained from medical records and the National
COVID-19 Database. To represent the blood type distribution of the general
population of Bahrain, the blood types of 4985 individuals who donated whole blood
or platelets at King Hamad University Hospital Blood Bank over the past 2 years were
obtained and analyzed.
3. Statistical analysis
Chi-squared (X2) and Fischer’s exact tests were used to compare the distributions of
blood groups and antibodies between samples. Odds Ratio (OR) tests were used to
study the odds of a blood type or antibody category testing positive, in a one-vs-all
manner. ORs are reported with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical values were
considered significant at p<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA
statistical software (version 15.1).

RESULTS
1. Analysis of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection
Of 4985 individuals representing the control group, we observed a high frequency of
blood group O (n=2316, 46.46%), followed by B (n=1225, 24.57%), A (n=1092,
21.91%) and AB (n=352, 7.06%) accordingly. A total of 2334 COVID-19 infected
individuals represented the COV+ group, showing an identical order of frequency;
blood group O (n=1060, 45.41%), followed by B (n=644, 27.59%), A (n=513, 21.98%)
and AB (n=117, 5.01%). The distributions of the two groups are shown in Figure 1.
Blood group distributions were statistically different between the two groups (X2 =
16.45, p = 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that blood group AB was
associated with a decreased risk of infection (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56 – 0.86, p=0.001)
while blood group B was associated with an increased risk (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.04 –
1.31, p=0.006). No association between blood group A and risk of COVID-19 infection
was found (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.89-1.13, p = 0.943)(Table 1). Analysis by antibody
class showed no association between type of antibodies present and risk of testing
positive (Table 1).

2. Analysis of severity of COVID-19 infection
To test the association between blood group and the susceptibility to a severe COVID19 infection, blood group distributions were compared between COVID-19 infected
individuals that required ICU admission and those that did not, COV+ICU+ and
COV+ICU- respectively. Of 196 COV+ICU+ individuals, 80 (40.82%) were blood group
O, 59 (30.10%) were blood group B, 46 (23.47%) were of blood group A, and 11
(5.61%) were of blood group AB. Of 2138 COV+ICU- individuals, 980 (45.84%) were
blood group O, 585 (27.36%) were blood group B, 467 (21.84%) were of blood group
A, and 106 (4.96%) were of blood group AB. The distributions of the two groups are
shown in Figure 2. No difference in blood group distributions was observed (X2 = 1.85,
p = 0.603). No association to severity of COVID-19 infection was found with blood
group or antibodies present (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Following several reports of the association between blood group distribution and risk
of COVID-19 or susceptibility to severe infection, we sought to analyse these trends
amongst the population in Bahrain. This study used blood-bank data of blood
distributions to represent the general population in Bahrain. The distributions we
obtained were similar to a previous report of blood-bank blood distributions, which also
showed that these distributions were comparable to population sample distributions in
Bahrain (12).
Regarding the association between blood group and risk of COVID-19 infection, most
studies were similar in reporting that blood group A was associated with an increased
frequency amongst COVID-19 individuals and risk of infection, and conversely that
blood group O was associated with a decreased frequency and risk of infection (5-9).
Our data does not present an association between susceptibility to COVID-19 infection
and blood group A, similar to observations by Latz et al. (11). In addition, we found a
significantly increased risk associated with blood group B, which is also comparable
to findings by Latz et al. (11). Individuals with blood group AB showed a decreased
risk of COVID-19 infection, synonymous with a few reports, however in all these cases
including this study, this group was represented by a small sample size (5, 6). Unlike
all other reports, no association between blood group O and decreased risk of infection
was observed.

To study the association of blood group and the severity of COVID-19 infection, we
compared blood group distributions between the general COVID-19 sample and those
that required ICU admission. As previously reported, no association was observed
between blood group and susceptibility to a more severe COVID-19 infection (6-8, 11).
Although there was a decrease in odds of individuals with blood group O requiring ICU
admission, similar to observations by Zhao et al., this was not statistically significant
(5). Hence, no association was observed between blood group and susceptibility to a
more severe infection.
As per Gerard et al., we extended the analysis by antibody class (10). There was no
association found between antibodies present and the risk of COVID-19. We observed
that individuals with anti-A antibodies were at higher odds of testing positive for
COVID-19, however this finding was not statistically significant. This finding
contradicts that by Gerard et al, who found that anti-A was associated with a
significantly lower risk of infection. There is no published analysis yet of the
relationship between antibodies and severity of outcome, however in this study we
found none.
Results from this study, and the limited reports in this field, reveal a variety of findings
making a conclusion regarding an association between blood type and COVID-19
challenging. However, this variation in results may indicate that an unexplored
underlying factor may be causing the association, not necessarily the blood group or
type of antibodies present.
