Abstract
The current diagnostic gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 clearance from infected patients is
two consecutive negative PCR test results. However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization
from protracted COVID complications despite such confirmed viral clearance, presenting a
clinical conundrum. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 266 COVID patients to compare
those that were admitted/re-admitted post-viral clearance (hospitalized post-clearance cohort,
n=93) with those that were hospitalized pre-clearance but were not re-admitted post-viral clearance
(non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n=173). In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we
used neural network models for the augmented curation of comorbidities and complications with
positive sentiment in the EHR physician notes. In the year preceding COVID onset, acute kidney
injury (n=15 (16.1%), p-value: 0.03), anemia (n=20 (21.5%), p-value: 0.02), and cardiac
arrhythmia (n=21 (22.6%), p-value: 0.05) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the
hospitalized post-clearance cohort. This study highlights that these specific pre-existing
conditions are associated with amplified hospitalization risk in COVID patients, despite their
successful SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance. Our finding that pre-COVID anemia amplifies risk of
post-COVID hospitalization is particularly concerning given the high prevalence and endemic
nature of anemia in many low- and middle-income countries (per the World Bank definition; e.g.
India, Brazil), which are unfortunately also seeing high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-induced mortality. This study motivates follow-up prospective research into the specific
risk factors we have identified that appear to predispose some patients towards the after effects of
COVID-19.

Article summary – Strengths and limitations of this study
● This is the first study at a major healthcare center analyzing risk factors for post-viral
clearance hospitalization of COVID-19 patients.
● This analysis uses augmented curation methods to identify complications and
comorbidities from the physician notes, rather than relying upon ICD codes.

● The statistical analysis identifies specific comorbidities in the year preceding PCR
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 which are associated with increased rates of post-viral clearance
hospitalization.
● The dataset used for this study is limited to a single healthcare system, so the underlying
clinical characteristics of the study population are biased to reflect the clinical
characteristics of individuals that receive medical treatment in certain regions of the United
States (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota).
● In this study, we use the first of two consecutive negative PCR tests to estimate the viral
clearance date for each patient, however the true viral clearance date for each patient is
unknown.

Introduction
To date, 42.1 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 with over 1
million deaths as of October 20201. Although many patients survived the disease, there is
increasing attention to the possibility of symptom development and hospitalization among patients
who have previously “cleared” the virus, as indicated by 2+ consecutive negative PCR test results.
Data on the long-term outcomes among cleared SARS-CoV-2 patients has been thus far limited
and often poorly defined. Some patients labeled as cleared have been shown to have a new positive
test after documented negative tests, a positive test after a period of quarantine, or develop new
symptoms requiring hospitalization after documented negative tests2–6. The former case is most
narrowly suggestive of delayed viral shedding, false positives, or re-infection while the latter case
allows for a more broader interpretation of possible outcomes after clearance to also include
delayed complications of the index hospitalization and manifestations of a systemic inflammatory
response7. Here, we will refer to clearance as patients with a history of confirmed positive SARSCoV-2 PCR and two subsequent consecutive negative PCR tests based on nasopharyngeal swabs.
A recent case series8 reported four patients with apparent SARS-CoV-2 reinfection after
an index hospitalization, despite resolution of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities and two
consecutive negative tests separated by a day. A single center cohort study of 414 patients with
SARS-CoV-2 reported a reinfection rate of 16.7% among cleared patients5, while a second cohort
study of 262 patients with SARS-CoV-2 reported a reinfection rate of 14.5% among cleared
patients4. To date, details on the outcomes of patients who require hospitalization after documented
clearance of SARS-CoV-2, however, remain unknown. These hospitalizations can have enormous
implications beyond individual outcomes in shaping how we guide our public health strategy,
allocate healthcare resources, and identify those at greatest risk.
The objective of this study is to characterize the cohort of COVID-19 patients who are
admitted or readmitted to the hospital for post-clearance of the virus (Figure 1). Here, we define
the clearance date of the virus as the first of 2+ consecutive negative PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2
infection. We compared this cohort of patients against COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized

pre-clearance of the virus, but not post-clearance. We then used augmented curation to compare
rates of COVID-19 associated complications in these two cohorts over the following time
horizons: (1) Pre-COVID: Day -365 to Day -11 relative to the first positive PCR test for SARSCoV-2, (2) SARS-CoV-2 positive: Day -10 relative to the first positive PCR test up to the
estimated viral clearance date, and (3) Post viral clearance: Day 1 to Day 90 relative to the
estimated viral clearance date. In particular, we considered the following complications: anemia,
cardiac arrhythmias, pleural effusion, hypertension, acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung
injury, heart failure, hyperglycemia, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure. We ran statistical
significance tests to identify complications which are enriched in the hospitalized post-clearance
cohort across the three time periods. Finally, we explored the temporal distribution of phenotype
occurrences in the clinical notes for both cohorts over the time window +/- 90 days relative to the
clearance date of the virus.

Methods
Institutional Review Board (IRB)
This retrospective research was conducted under IRB 20–003278, ‘Study of COVID-19
patient characteristics with augmented curation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to inform
strategic and operational decisions’. For further information regarding the Mayo Clinic
Institutional Review Board (IRB) policy, and its institutional commitment, membership

Patient and Public Involvement
The development of the research question and outcome measures was informed by prior
literature and information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on risk
factors for severe COVID-19 illness9. No patients were involved in the design of the study, but
physicians from the Mayo Clinic who are involved with the COVID research taskforce and the
clinical care for COVID patients were involved with the study design and execution.
Study design
Of 22,223 patients with at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, 1,355 had two
documented negative tests following their last positive test result with an estimated viral clearance
date (date of the first negative test) more than 90 days prior to the date of this analysis (October
27, 2020). Among these 1,355 patients, 266 patients were admitted to the hospital, and 93 patients
were admitted or readmitted to the hospital following the estimated viral clearance date. We
define the hospitalized post-clearance cohort to consist of these 93 patients. We note that this
cohort does not include patients who simply remained in the hospital following their estimated
clearance date. On the other hand, 173 patients were admitted to the hospital pre-clearance, but

were not admitted or readmitted to the hospital following the estimated clearance date. We refer
to this group of 173 patients as the non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort. In Figure 1, we
provide a schematic of the study design and the key findings from this study. In Table 1, we
provide the general clinical characteristics for the two cohorts, including:
● Demographics: age, gender, race, ethnicity
● Hospitalization status COVID Pre-clearance: whether or not the patient was admitted
to the hospital during the index COVID-19 infection,
● Relative Clearance Date: Number of days between first positive PCR test and first of
two negative PCR tests.
● Comorbidities: Anemia, Asthma, Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD),
Hyperglycemia, Hypertension, Obesity, Obstructive sleep apnea, Type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Augmented curation of clinical notes
A BERT-based neural network10 was applied to identify phenotypes of interest in the
clinical notes of the study population. The model was previously developed to classify the
sentiment of general phenotypes11 and thrombotic event phenotypes12 in the encounter notes of
COVID-19 patients. The categories of this classification model include: Yes (confirmed
diagnosis), No (ruled out diagnosis), Maybe (possibility of disease), and Other (alternate context,
e.g. family history of disease). This model was trained using nearly 250 different phenotypes and
18,500 sentences and achieves 93.6% overall accuracy and over 95% precision and recall for
Yes/No sentiment classification11. For this study, the phenotypes of interest included all of the
following comorbidities and complications along with their synonyms:
● Comorbidities: Anemia, Asthma, Cancer, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD),
Hyperglycemia, Hypertension, Obesity, Obstructive sleep apnea, Type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
● Complications: Acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury (ARDS / ALI),
Acute kidney injury (AKI), Cardiac arrest, Cardiac arrhythmias, Disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC), Heart failure, Myocardial infarction, Pleural effusion,
Pulmonary embolism, Respiratory failure, Sepsis, Septic shock, Stroke / Cerebrovascular
incident, Venous thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis (VTE / DVT).
We ran the model to classify the sentiment for all of the above phenotypes in all of the
clinical notes for each patient in the time periods considered in this study. Only sentences
containing a phenotype with a positive sentiment (labeled “Yes” by the model) with a confidence
of 0.95 or above were deemed positive mentions. Repeated sentences for the same patient are
ignored. For the SARS-CoV-2 positive phase and post-viral clearance phase, we only consider
the presence or absence of a positive sentiment. For the pre-COVID time window, we consider
thresholds of 1, 2, and 3 as the minimum number of positive mentions.

SARS-CoV-2 PCR and IgG tests conducted by Mayo Clinic hospitals and health system
In the context of PCR testing, patients seen at Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN were tested
by either a laboratory-developed test or the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay13,14. Patients seen at
Mayo Clinic’s Florida hospitals and Arizona hospitals were tested using the Roche cobas test and
Abbott diagnostic test respectively15. These SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests amplify different segments
of the viral genome but are considered largely equivalent from the perspective of their analytical
performance. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) code of the SARSCoV-2 IgG test analyzed is 94563-4 (https://loinc.org/94563-4/)16. In the context of SARS-CoV2 IgG test, patient serum samples were tested by Euroimmun Inc. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA
(Lubeck, Germany) according to the manufacturer instructions and as described previously on the
Agility automated ELISA analyzer (Dynex Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA)17. This is a
qualitative ELISA for detection of IgG-class antibodies against a recombinant version of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit 1 (S1) protein and has received Food and Drug Administration
Emergency Use Authorization.

Statistical significance tests
Fisher exact tests were applied pairwise across each of the covariates of interest in
comparing each cohort to its respective control group, generating both a p-value and an Odds
Ratio. This test was applied using the SciPy package18 in Python. p-values generated in this
hypothesis were corrected using a Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

Results
COVID patients hospitalized post-viral clearance have higher rates of pre-COVID acute kidney
injury, anemia, and cardiac arrhythmias as underlying conditions
In order to understand the patient characteristics that differentiated the ‘hospitalized postclearance’ and ‘non-hospitalized post-clearance’ groups, we compared the clinical covariates in
both the groups by analyzing phenotypes recorded with a positive sentiment in the patient history
of both groups. In Table 2, we present the incidence of phenotypes which are enriched in the
clinical notes during the pre-COVID time period, considering 1, 2, and 3 as the thresholds for
distinct positive mentions. When the threshold is 1, we count all of the patients even with a single
positive mention of the phenotype, and as the threshold increases, this criterion becomes more
stringent and there is a monotonic decline.
We observe that with a threshold of 1 distinct positive mention, acute kidney injury (AKI)
is enriched in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort (n: 15 (16.1%), relative risk: 4, 95% C.I.: [1.7,
8.8], p-value: 0.03). This suggests that patients with even a single positive mention of AKI may

be at higher risk of poorer long-term prognosis, such as hospitalization post-clearance of the virus.
In addition, with a threshold of 3 distinct positive mentions, the hospitalized post-clearance cohort
is enriched for anemia (n: 20 (21.5%), relative risk: 3.1, 95% C.I.: [1.6, 5.9], p-value: 0.02) and
cardiac arrhythmias (n: 21 (22.6%), relative risk: 2.3, 95% C.I.: [1.3, 4.1], p-value: 0.05). The fact
that these phenotypes require more mentions to differentiate the two cohorts motivates the need to
investigate whether these incidents are chronic or recurring, and how that may be linked with
increased risk of post-clearance hospitalization.
In Figure 2, we present the temporal distribution of phenotypes in the clinical notes for
acute kidney injury, anemia, and cardiac arrhythmias for the Pre-COVID time period. We observe
that both cohorts have higher rates of reports for all three phenotypes in the time period of -50 days
to -10 days relative to the first positive PCR testing date. In addition, we observe that acute kidney
injury is reported more frequently in the clinical notes from -200 days to -280 days relative to the
first positive PCR testing date. These clusters of notes may reflect groups of patients who were
admitted to the hospital with these phenotypes around the same time. In Supplementary Table
S1, we present the enrichment results for all of the pre-existing conditions that we considered,
including those which are not significantly differentiated.
Post-clearance of SARS-CoV-2 virus, COVID patients experience complications including
cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary, and immunological conditions
In Table 3, we present the rates of complications for the two cohorts of interest for the two
time periods following PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2: (1) SARS-CoV-2 positive phase, and (2)
post-viral clearance phase.
For the post-viral clearance phase, we observe the following
complications at higher rates in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort: acute kidney injury,
anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure,
hyperglycemia, hypertension, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, sepsis, and venous
thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis. Among these, the most significantly enriched
phenotypes are: pleural effusion (relative risk: 4.2, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 7.9], p-value: 1.2E-4), cardiac
arrhythmias (relative risk: 5.3, 95% C.I.: [2.1, 12], p-value: 9.3E-4), and hyperglycemia (relative
risk: Infinity, 95% C.I.: [1.8, 5,400], p-value: 1.0E-3).
In Figure 3, we show rates of these phenotypes over the +/- 90 time window centered
around the estimated viral clearance date for each patient. For most of these complications, we
observe for the case cohort that the majority of reports in the clinical notes occur within the first
three weeks following the estimated viral clearance date. An exception is for pleural effusions,
which occurs relatively frequently in the notes of the case cohort in the two months following the
clearance date. In addition, we observe moderate amounts of reports for cardiac arrhythmias,
hyperglycemia, anemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome / acute lung injury, hypertension, and
venous thromboembolism / deep vein thrombosis around 50 to 70 days post-clearance.

Discussion
The topic of hospitalization and readmission in COVID-19 patients has been under major
focus for mitigating national healthcare costs, particularly among 30-day readmissions that
account for $17 billion in avoidable Medicare expenditures19. Prior studies have investigated
hospitalization and readmission after recovery from other acute illnesses, such as influenza and
community-acquired pneumonia, heart failure, and decompensated cirrhosis. In the case of
influenza, the most common cause of short-term re-admission is due to non-influenza pneumonia,
thought to result from complex interactions between the recovering host immune system and
inflammatory response, reminiscent to a limited extent of the systemic inflammatory response seen
in SARS-CoV-2. These outcomes are associated with notably higher costs of care and increased
mortality20. Given the widespread prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, similar outcomes warrant detailed
studies in patients hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance.
In this study, we found that patients hospitalized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance had
significantly higher odds of having comorbidities of anemia as well as experiencing serious
complications of ARDS/ALI, AKI, pleural effusion, and sepsis compared to hospitalized controls.
Approximately a quarter (24.5%) of these patients required ICU admission. In addition, we found
that hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, and diabetes were not increased among
patients hospitalized after clearance compared to controls. These are co-morbidities that have been
previously well-described to be associated with poorer outcomes during an index SARS-CoV-2
infection21. One possible hypothesis for these findings is that many of these hospitalizations postclearance were not due to re-infection per se, but rather secondary to a systemic inflammatory
response, resulting in the observed increased frequency of ARDS and sepsis noted in the cases, for
which patients with a higher frailty index may be more susceptible. Patients hospitalized after
clearance had increased odds of having anemia compared to their respective controls. It has been
well-studied that patients with anemia, independent of other health conditions, are at higher risk
of frailty and mortality, particularly in older patients22. Additionally, a limitation of our study is
that our algorithm did not include all forms of obstructive airway disease, including COPD, which
has been indicated to increase mortality in COVID-1923. Despite these caveats, our finding that
pre-COVID anemia is endemic or highly prevalent in several low- and middle-income countries23,
where COVID-19 is unfortunately a raging pandemic (e.g. India and Brazil) is especially
concerning from the standpoint of higher post-viral clearance hospitalization risk in COVID
patients.
A point of interest in explaining heterogeneous outcomes as regards hospital admission
following SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance is the development of IgG antibodies post-clearance. In
the context of this study 16 of 23 patients (69.5%) in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort tested
for IgG antibodies test positive; this is compared to a rate of 19 of 23 patients (82.6%) in the nonhospitalized post-clearance cohort. The difference between these groups (16/23 vs. 19/23; fisher
exact p-value 0.49) is not significant in this case. However, as the antibody testing data increases

further investigation into the relationship between IgG seropositivity and complications following
SARS-CoV-2 clearance may be warranted.
There are several limitations of this study due to the observational nature of the data. First,
we are not controlling for PCR testing frequency, so the study population which receives access
to multiple PCR tests to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection clearance may not be representative of
COVID-19 patient population in general. In addition, the phenotypes of complications and
comorbidities which are identified in the notes with positive sentiment may In addition, the
control groups for the hospitalized post-clearance cohorts were not propensity matched due to
limited cohort size. However, patients in the hospitalized cohort did not differ in demographic
characteristics, and compared to prior investigations on this subject, the size of our cohort is a
strength of the study. Next, the current time points chosen to align the patient journeys are anchored
by the first positive PCR test and the first of the two or more negative tests. Aligned the patient
journeys based on their hospitalization events can help identify the conditions that are enriched
with each hospitalization event. Finally, there is a limitation of the augmented curation model
which is used to identify complications and comorbidities, because it only determines whether or
not the phenotype was mentioned with positive sentiment in a clinical note, and does not take into
account the temporal component. Therefore, although we know that certain phenotypes are
enriched in the cohorts which are admitted to the hospital/ICU post-clearance, the dates of these
complications are uncertain. There is research ongoing to develop natural language processing
(NLP) based neural network models which can differentiate effectively between active and
historical phenotype diagnoses, which could strengthen these conclusions for future analyses.
The phenotypes described here relate to EHR based mentions of conditions. Future work
would include a complementary analysis based on lab tests relevant to the identified phenotypes
such as estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate, Blood Urea Nitrogen test, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit,
Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST) and Bilirubin. A longitudinal analysis
integrating clinical notes-based augmented curation and lab-measurements will be useful in
formulating a case definition of long-term COVID-19 (long-COVID). Overall, our finding of the
long-term adverse effects of COVID-19 motivates the need to understand the biological and
mechanistic underpinning of the SARS-CoV-2 driven long-term adverse effects in order to find
appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Finally, this study also emphasizes the need
for detailed curation of structured and unstructured clinical data to better understand the dynamics
of viral clearance, underlying conditions, and long-term complications.

Table 1: General characteristics of study population (patients who “cleared” after
previously being SARS-CoV-2 positive) for hospitalized and non-hospitalized postclearance cohorts. Demographic variables in the hospitalized and non-hospitalized postclearance cohorts. The columns are: (1) Hospitalized post-clearance: clinical characteristics of
the cohort of patients who are admitted or readmitted to the hospital following the estimated
clearance date of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (2) Non-Hospitalized post-clearance: clinical
characteristics of the control group of patients who are not admitted to the hospital following the
estimated clearance date, (3) BH-corrected P-value: Benjamani-Hochberg corrected p-values
using Fisher Exact test for comparisons of proportions and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous
covariates.

Table 2: Enrichments of significant phenotypes in the Pre-COVID time horizon for 1, 2, and
3 clinical note thresholds (AKI, anemia, and cardiac arrhythmias). Phenotypes in the
hospitalized and non-hospitalized post-clearance cohorts, along with results from statistical
significance tests representing the time period one year prior up to 11 days prior to the first positive
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for a patient. Features which are significantly different between the two
cohorts are highlighted in green. The columns are: (1) Phenotype: phenotype of interest, (2)
Minimum distinct positive mentions: Minimum number of distinct mentions in the physician
notes with a positive sentiment required to record a phenotype, (3) Hospitalized post-clearance:
number of patients in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort with the phenotype recorded in the
Pre-COVID time horizon, (4) Non-Hospitalized post-clearance: number of patients in the nonhospitalized post-clearance cohort with the phenotype recorded in the Pre-COVID time horizon,
(5) BH-corrected p-value: Benjamani-Hochberg corrected p-values using Fisher Exact test for
comparisons of proportions, (6) Relative risk (95% CI): Ratio of the phenotype incidence in the
hospitalized post-clearance cohort to the phenotype incidence in the non-hospitalized postclearance cohort, along with 95% confidence interval bounds.

Table 3. Comparison of complications in the hospitalized and non-hospitalized postclearance cohorts. Complications in the hospitalized and non-hospitalized post-clearance
cohorts, along with results from statistical significance tests stratified by time periods including:
pre-covid infection, between SARS-CoV-2 infection and clearance, and post-COVID infection.
Phenotypes are identified in the physician notes via the neural network model with a minimum
number of 1+ distinct mentions with a positive sentiment in the time horizon required to record a
phenotype. Features which are significantly different between the two cohorts are highlighted in
green. The columns are: (1) Time window: time window of interest, (2) Phenotype: phenotype

to the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test for a patient. Features which are significantly different
between the two cohorts are highlighted in green. The columns are: (1) Phenotype: phenotype
of interest, (2) Minimum distinct positive mentions: Minimum number of distinct mentions in
the physician notes with a positive sentiment required to record a phenotype, (3) Hospitalized
post-clearance: number of patients in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort with the phenotype
recorded in the Pre-COVID time horizon, (4) Non-Hospitalized post-clearance: number of
patients in the non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort with the phenotype recorded in the PreCOVID time horizon, (5) BH-corrected p-value: Benjamani-Hochberg corrected p-values using
Fisher Exact test for comparisons of proportions, (6) Relative risk (95% CI): Ratio of the
phenotype incidence in the hospitalized post-clearance cohort to the phenotype incidence in the
