In this short report we present a preliminary assessment of the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (25(OH)D), body
mass index (BMI), ethnicity and other lifestyle factors in the first-reported UK Biobank COVID-19 positive cases (n 580)
compared with negative controls (n 723). The COVID-19 cases include those who have been treated as a hospital inpatient as well as those who have not, and are from England only. Mean (SD) for age was 57.5 (8.7) in positive cases
and 57.9 (8.7) in negative controls.
Serum 25(OH)D status was almost identical in those who tested positive (median (Interquartile range, IQR)= 43.3 (32.1)
nmol/L) compared to those who tested negative (median (IQR) 44.1 (31.2) nmol/L) for COVID-19. It must be borne in
mind that the sample on average was not severely vitamin D deficient and results may differ in populations with a
higher prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency. As shown in Table 1, there was no difference in 25(OH)D status by
gender; however 25(OH)D was significantly lower in those with obesity [P<0.001] by 9 nmol/L compared with those of
normal or overweight. Of note, 25(OH)D status was also significantly lower in those of Asian, Black and Mixed ethnicity
(by 16nmol/L) [P<0.001] compared with those of White ethnicity. This supports previous findings of a low serum
25(OH)D in UK South Asian individuals from the UK DFINES study1.

A logistic regression model (Table 2) suggests that being overweight or obese; living in London; being male and being
of Asian, Black or Mixed ethnicity is associated with a higher odds of testing positive for COVID-19, which confirms
clinical observations which have been reported in the media.
Being a regular smoker (smoking on all or most days) was associated with a reduced odds (OR=0.58 (0.39-0.86)) of
testing positive, compared with being a non-smoker (OR=1). However a key limitation of this analysis is that there
were only a small number of regular smokers (n 142) and persons of Asian, Black or Mixed/Other Ethnicity in the

sample and larger populations will be required to confirm these results.
Another limitation of our analysis is that vitamin D status was assessed in the UK Biobank cohort using baseline samples
which were collected in 2006-2010. However, there is scientific evidence to show that that an individual’s vitamin D

status tends to track over time; for example, those with status in the top quartile of 25(OH)D status in the population
will likely still be in that range over a decade later2. Therefore, we used quartiles of 25(OH)D status in our analysis
rather than the specific 25(OH)D value which showed a null association with Covid-19 test result. When a BMI x
25(OH)D status (continuous variable) interaction term was trialed in the model, it was not statistically significant
suggesting the interaction between BMI and 25(OH)D status did not predict test result in the currently available
dataset.
Nevertheless, from our initial statistical model of the UK Biobank data, we can conclude a higher odds of testing positive
for COVID-19 is associated with the cofactors of living in London; being male and being of Asian, Black or Mixed
ethnicity.
As the number of reported cases increases in the UK Biobank, we will expand our model to control for additional
factors such as blood pressure, use of statin medications, diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,
diabetes, COVID-19-attributed mortality and conditions affecting immune function, as well as genetics.
