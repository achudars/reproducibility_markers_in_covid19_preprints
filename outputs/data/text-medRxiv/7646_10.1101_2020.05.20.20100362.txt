Abstract
This dataset contains anonymised human
lung computed tomography (CT) scans with
COVID-19 related findings, as well as without
such findings. A small subset of studies has
been annotated with binary pixel masks
depicting regions of interests (ground-glass
opacifications and consolidations). CT scans
were obtained between 1st of March, 2020 and
25th of April, 2020, and provided by municipal
hospitals in Moscow, Russia. Permanent link:

recover in their homes (under supervision via
telemedicine). Inpatient facilities use CT for
initial and differential diagnostic assessment,
evaluation of disease progression, and
determining, whether the patient should be
admitted to the intensive care unit or discharged
[1,3,4].
The ever-increasing use of CT translates
to an immense burden on the health system. For
example, in Moscow, the chain of municipal
outpatient CT centers perform about 90 studies
per 1 CT scanner per day (the record holder
scanner performed 163 studies during one day).
To standardize and streamline clinical
decision-making the experts developed a
classification model that grades the severity of
lung tissue abnormalities observed on CT
images along with other symptoms (see Table).
Increased burnout and high risk of
occupational death among healthcare workers
call for automation of the reading process,
which will improve productivity and minimize
errors [8]. Preliminary figures indicate the AI
algorithms have sufficient accuracy for the
diagnostic
evaluation
of
COVID-19
(responsiveness – 90%, specificity – 96%,
AUC – 0.96, overall accuracy 76.37-98.26)
[6,9].
Dataset
Data were obtained between 1st of
March, 2020 and 25th of April, 2020, and
provided by municipal hospitals in Moscow,
Russia. This dataset contains anonymised
human lung computed tomography (CT) scans
with COVID-19 related findings (CT1-CT4), as
well as without such findings (CT0) (fig.).

Background
During the COVID-19 pandemic, most
countries faced a tremendous increase in the
healthcare burden. This situation calls for the
most careful use of financial and human
resources than ever before. Unfortunately, the
preventive measures put in place in medical
facilities are not always enough to avoid deaths
of medical workers. The loss of trained
specialists in emergency care, radiology, etc., is
especially concerning. Computed tomography
is considered a key tool to diagnose and
evaluate the progression of COVID-19. The CT
studies are performed in the outpatient setting
and target patients with acute respiratory
symptoms, and those with established diagnosis
and mild disease progression who are able to

study has been saved in NifTI format and
archived into Gzip archive. During this process
only every 10-th image (Instance) was
preserved in the final study file.

There are 1110 studies in dataset. Population:
1110 persons, males – 42%, females – 56%,
other/unknown – 2%; age from 18 to 97 years,
median – 47 years. As a first step, all studies
(n=1110) were distributed into 5 categories

Value
The dataset is intended for education,
calibration, and independent assessment of the
AI (computer vision) algorithms [7].
To help combating COVID-19 the AI
(computer vision) algorithms will allow:

1. Triaging patients in outpatient facilities
to secure rapid and consistent routing (incl.
based on the CT0-4 criteria)
2. Prioritizing studies that contain signs of
COVID-19 in the worklist
3. Performing a rapid and high-quality
assessment of abnormal changes by comparing
several studies

4. Minimizing the risks of errors and
missed abnormalities.
At the moment, there is a wide range of
publicly available COVID-19 datasets [2,5].
However, this should not be viewed as an
obstacle for the following reasons:
1. Development of algorithms requires
large volumes of high-quality clinical data that
is representative of real-world patient
populations
2. The algorithms must be verified with
new data, i.e. new datasets that were not used
during the learning and calibration phases. The
more data are available in the open sources, the
better for the developers

www.mosmed.ai

3. The available datasets are relatively
small and rarely present additional information,
such as tags and/or binary masks for the regions
of interest (ROI).
