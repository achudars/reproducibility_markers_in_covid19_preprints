Abstract

The Japanese government has declared a national emergency and travel entry ban since

the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began. As of June 19, 2020, there

have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iwate. Here, we analyzed the excess deaths

as well as the number of patients and medical earnings due to the pandemic from

prefectural hospitals located in one of the least-affected areas in Japan. From January to

March 2020, the excess death rates per month were not significantly higher than the

past-year average. Compared to January 2020, the numbers of both outpatients and

inpatients in April 2020 showed a 5.2% and 6.1% decrease, respectively. Accordingly, the

amount of medical earnings of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 3.0%

and 6.3% decrease, respectively. Present analysis demonstrated that there were no excess

deaths due to “unidentified” COVID-19 infections in Iwate; however, hospital budgetary

management has been affected by the social restrictions. Regardless of COVID-19 infection

spread, it may be difficult to maintain daily medical services if such low service activity

continues in the existing hospitals. Additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to

evaluate the effects of social restrictions on hospital management, but the true demand of

regional medical services may emerge after this outbreak.

Introduction

Iwate prefecture is one of the Japanese municipal governments located along the

northeastern Pacific coast, where approximately 1.26 million people live in an area

equivalent to the state of Connecticut. In Iwate, there are 1,376 beds per capita and 26.7%
have been maintained by 20 prefectural hospitals in 20181. As of June 19, 2020, there have
been no confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Iwate.2 The

nationwide excess death rate during the pandemic has been 0.7% below the historical
average.3 These results suggest that immediate massive disruption of medical care by the

COVID-19 outbreak is unlikely to occur in Iwate.

The Japanese government has declared a national emergency and travel entry

ban for >180 countries/regions since the pandemic began. These restrictions have resulted

in suppression of travel, logistics, and consumer confidence. Subsequently, the financial

impact on some businesses has been seen despite a decline in the number of COVID-19

infections. It can now be hypothesized that even public hospitals may face a financial

burden. Here, we analyzed the excess deaths as well as the number of patients and medical

earnings due to the pandemic from prefectural hospitals located in one of the least-affected

areas of municipal governments in Japan.

Methods

The data analytical period was between February 2019 and April 2020. The number of

deaths in Iwate was obtained from a public database released by the Japanese Ministry of

Health, Labor and Welfare. The excess death rate in Iwate was defined as follows: the

number of deaths per month in 2020 divided by the past-year (2015-2019) average number

of deaths per month. The number of patients and medical earnings in all 20 Iwate prefectural

hospitals and 6 clinics was obtained with permission from the Iwate Prefecture Medical

Bureau. A three-month moving average was calculated in terms of the number of outpatients

and inpatients as well as the medical earnings of outpatients and inpatients.

Results

From January to March 2020, the excess death rates per month in Iwate were not

significantly higher than the past-year average (Fig. 1A), whereas the numbers of patients

and amount of medical earnings per month showed a decreasing trend (Fig. 1B, C).

Compared to January 2020, the numbers of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020

showed a 5.2% and 6.1% decrease, respectively (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, the amount of

medical earnings of both outpatients and inpatients in April 2020 showed a 3.0% and 6.3%

decrease, respectively (Fig. 1C). All major governmental social declarations were released

between January and April 2020.

Discussion

Unlike a city lockdown, Japan's emergency declaration is not intended to be an

extraordinary compulsory regulation. Present analysis demonstrated that there were no

excess deaths due to “unidentified” COVID-19 infections in Iwate; however, hospital

budgetary management has been affected by the emergency declaration. Routine hospital

visits were postponed for outpatients and non-urgent surgeries were rescheduled. A hospital

visit itself is considered to be a risk for infection. Regardless of COVID-19 infection spread, it

may be very difficult to maintain daily medical services if such low service activity continues

in the existing hospitals. Limitations of this study include a limited follow-up period through

April 30, 2020 and the lack of appropriate municipal governments in Japan for comparison.

In addition, the excess deaths were counted monthly instead of weekly because of public
data availability4. Thus, the present data may not be fully applicable to specific issues in

individual hospitals.

Additional longitudinal studies will be necessary to evaluate the effects of social

restrictions on hospital management, but the true demand of regional medical services may

emerge after this outbreak.
