Abstract

35

Infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has

36

been associated with leukopenia and uncontrolled inflammatory response in critically ill

37

patients. A better comprehension of SARS-CoV-2-induced monocyte death is essential

38

for the identification of therapies capable to control the hyper-inflammation and reduce

39

viral replication in patients with COVID-19. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 induces

40

inflammasome activation and cell death by pyroptosis in human monocytes,

41

experimentally infected and from patients under intensive care. Pyroptosis was dependent

42

on caspase-1 engagement, prior to IL-1ß production and inflammatory cell death.

43

Monocytes exposed to SARS-CoV-2 downregulate HLA-DR, suggesting a potential

44

limitation to orchestrate the immune response. Our results originally describe

45

mechanisms by which monocytes, a central cellular component recruited from peripheral

46

blood to respiratory tract, succumb to control severe 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-

47

19).

48

Author summary

49

Since its emergence in China in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome

50

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused thousands of deaths worldwide. Currently, the

51

number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and in need of antiviral, anti-

52

inflammatory, anticoagulant and more invasive treatments has overwhelmed the health

53

systems worldwide. In our study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of inducing

54

inflammatory cell death in human monocytes, one of the main cell types responsible for

55

anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response. As a consequence of this intracellular inflammatory

56

mechanism (inflammasome engagement), an exacerbated production of inflammatory

57

mediators occurs. The infection also decreases the expression of HLA-DR in monocytes,

58

a molecule related to the orchestration of the immune response in case of viral infections.

59

We also demonstrated that the HIV-1 protease inhibitor, atazanavir (ATV), prevented the

60

uncontrolled inflammatory response, cell death and reduction in HLA-DR expression in

61

SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes. Our study provides relevant information on the effects

62

of SARS-CoV-2 infection on human monocytes, as well as on the effect of ATV in

63

preventing these pathological effects on the host.

Introduction

67

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of

68

the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged in China, causing a major public

69

health burden in decades. Patients with COVID-19 may develop an asymptomatic or mild

70

disease or be affected by the life threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),

71

which is characterized by elevated serum levels of proinflammatory mediators, the

72

cytokine storm (1–3). In the respiratory tract of patients with severe COVID-19,

73

monocytes/macrophages may be the main source of uncontrolled levels of the pro-

74

inflammatory mediators TNF-α and IL-6 (4). Plasmatic levels of IL-6 have been

75

associated with mortality, intensive care admission and hospitalization, representing a

76

poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 (5). The uncontrolled inflammation promoted by

77

SARS-CoV-2 in severe COVID-19 is not acute, it negatively associates with viral loads

78

in nasopharyngeal swabs and represents an important event from 7 to 10 days after onset

79

of illness (6,7). The SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm associates with intense cell

80

death (8,9).

81

There are various mechanisms involved in cell death, which are differently

82

engaged from development to responses to infection (10). For certain diseases, such as

83

COVID-19, in which the immunopathogenesis mechanisms associate with poor clinical

84

outcomes, controlling the way cells collapse to infection is vital for the host (10). For

85

example, cell death from necrosis, which can occur from necroptosis to pyroptosis, tends

86

to exacerbate inflammation due to the rupture of the cellular plasma membrane.

87

Pyroptosis, in particular, begins with the activation of the inflammasome, an intracellular

88

structure that involves several intracellular molecules such as caspase-1(10,11), leads to

89

leakage of the cytoplasmic content, favors inflammatory infiltrate (11) and amplifies of

90

the inflammatory response (12). These mechanisms of cell death contrasts with apoptosis,

91

a more controlled process that maintain the host’s homeostasis.

92

In severe COVID-19, the cytokine storm associates with high levels of tissue

93

insult, judged by increased levels lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimer in the

94

plasma (6–8). Moreover, high LDH levels and leukopenia in severe COVID-19 points

95

out that white cells loses the integrity of plasma membrane (6–8). Among these cells,

96

monocytes should orchestrate the equilibrium between innate and adaptative immune

97

responses, which may be presumably affected during cytokine storm. Indeed, severe

98

immune dysregulation with low antigen presenting capacity is evidenced by reduced

99

expression of HLA-DR in monocytes during COVID-19, which is strongly associated

100

with severe respiratory failure (4).

101

The leukopenia of patients with severe COVID-19 seem to precede the cytokine

102

storm (13–18). Moreover, in other virus-induced cytokine storm episodes in the

103

respiratory tract, such as induced by influenza A virus, monocytes and macrophages are

104

severely affected (13). Thus, we hypothesized that the monocyte cell death induced by

105

SARS-COV-2 exacerbates the production of inflammatory cytokines, as well as impairs

106

the immune balance in the hosts. In fact, we found that SARS-CoV-2 triggers the

107

activation of the inflammasome, leading to pyroptosis in human monocytes, by

108

experimental or natural infection. Pyroptosis was dependent on caspase-1 engagement,

109

prior to IL-1ß production and dysregulation of cytokine release. Monocytes that survive

110

after SARS-CoV-2 challenge downregulate HLA-DR, being less likely to properly

111

orchestrate the immune response. Finally, we show that the reproposed antiviral drug

112

atazanavir (ATV) could block this deleterious loop in favor of the host.

113

Material and Methods

114

Reagents

115

Atazanavir (ATV) and Ribavirin were received as donations from Instituto de

116

Tecnologia de Fármacos (Farmanguinhos, Fiocruz). The antiviral Lopinavir/ritonavir

117

Cells and Virus

128

African green monkey kidney (Vero, subtype E6) cells were cultured in DMEM

129

high glucose supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, Utah)

130

and 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (P/S). Vero cells were incubated

131

at 37°C in 5 % CO2 atmosphere.

132

Human primary monocytes were obtained through plastic adherence of peripheral

133

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were obtained from buffy coat preparations of

134

healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare). In brief,

135

PBMCs (2.0 x 106 cells) were plated onto 48-well plates (NalgeNunc) in RPMI-1640

136

without serum for 2 to 4 h; then, non-adherent cells were removed by washing and the

137

remaining monocytes were maintained in DMEM with 5% human serum (HS; Millipore)

138

and penicillin/streptomycin.

139

SARS-CoV-2 was isolated and expanded on Vero E6 cells from a nasopharyngeal

140

swab of a confirmed case from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Experiments were performed after

141

one passage in cell culture, when Vero E6 cells with DMEM plus 2% FBS in 150 cm2

142

flasks were incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Cytopathic effect was observed

143

daily and peaked 4 to 5 days after infection. All procedures related to virus culture were

144

handled at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) multiuser facility, according to WHO guidelines.

145

Virus titers were determined as the tissue culture infectious dose at 50% (TCID50/mL).

146

Virus stocks were kept in -80 °C ultralow freezers. The virus strain was sequenced to

147

confirm the virus identity and its complete genome is publicly deposited (GenBank

148

accession no. MT710714).

154

supernatants were harvested and virus replication was quantified by real time RT- PCR

155

and infectious titers by TCID50/mL.

156

Virus titration

157

Monolayers of Vero cells (2 x 104 cell/well) in 96-well culture plates were infected

158

with log- based dilutions of the supernatants containing SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C.

159

The cells were washed and fresh medium with 2% FBS was added. After 3 to 5 days, the

160

cytopathic effects were scored in at least 10 replicates per dilution by independent readers,

161

who were blind with respect to source of the supernatant. Reed and Muench scoring

162

method was employed to determine TCID50/mL.

163

Flow cytometer analysis

164

For flow cytometry analysis, monocytes were diluted in labelling buffer (106

165

cells/mL). Then, 100 µL of cell samples were marked with 5 µL of AnnexinV and PI for

166

15 minutes for cell death evaluation. Around 10,000 gated events were acquired using

167

FACSCalibur and the analysis was performed using the CellQuest software. Monocytes

168

were gated through cell size (foward light scatter, FSC) and granularity (side light scatter,

169

SSC) analysis.

170

Human monocytes were stained for caspase‐1 activity with FAM‐YVAD‐FMK

171

(fluorescent‐labeled inhibitor of caspase‐1 [FLICA] and FAM-FLICA Caspase-3/7

172

activity or HLA-DR APC.H7 or IgG APC.H7. Caspase-1 and caspase-3/7 activity was

173

determined via flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) by detecting FLICA fluorescence and

174

expression of HLA-DR as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value for each sample.

175

Acquisition of data was set to count a total of 10,000 events, and the FLOWJO software

176

package was used to analyze the data.

177

Microscopic analysis

178

Human primary monocytes were plated on glass coverslips at density of 2-8 x 105

179

cells/well in 48-well plates. Infection was performed for 2 h at 37 °C and then fresh

180

medium with 2% FBS was added. After 24 h, the cells were washed with Binding buffer

181

and stained with PI (0.5 µg/mL) for 5 minutes. Next, the cells were fixed with 3.7%

182

formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature. The nuclei were stained with DAPI

183

(1µg/mL) for 5 min and the coverslips were mounted using an antifade mounting medium

184

(VECTASHIELD). Fluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with an x100

185

objective lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

186

Measurements Inflammatory Mediators and cell death marker

187

The levels of IL-1ß, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and LDH were quantified in the culture

188

supernatants from infected and uninfected monocytes using ELISA kits, according to the

189

manufacturer’s intructions (R&D System).

190

Extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was quantified using Doles® kit

191

according to manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cell culture supernatants were

192

centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 1 minute, to remove cellular debris, and then 25 μL were

193

placed into 96-well plates and incubated with 5 μL of ferric alum and 100 μL of LDH

194

substrate for 3 minutes at 37 oC. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, oxidized

195

form) was added followed by the addition of a stabilizing solution. After 10 minutes, the

196

reaction was read in a spectrophotometer at 492 nm.

197

Western blot assay

198

Cellular extracts of 1x106 cells were homogenized in the RIPA lysis buffer in the

199

presence of proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and the protein levels were measured

200

by BCA protein assay kit. A total of 20 μg of protein was loaded onto a 10% sodium

201

dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) for separation by electrophoresis and

202

the protein bands were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membranes

203

(ImmobilonP-SQ, Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5 % albumin diluted in

204

Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05 % of Tween 20 for 2 hours at room temperature and

205

incubated with the specific primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), to detect pro-

206

caspase-1 and cleaved-caspase-1, after overnight incubation at 4 °C. After washing,

207

membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (IRDye® 800CW Goat-anti-

208

Mouse and IRDye® 680LT Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Antibody, LI-COR, Lincoln) for 30

209

minutes at RT. The protein bands were visualized by digital fluorescence

210

(Odyssey® CLx Imaging System), and protein density was analyzed by the ImageJ

211

software. All the data were normalized by β-actin expression quantification.

Human subjects.

214

We prospectively enrolled severe COVID19 RT-PCR-confirmed cases, as well as

215

SARS-CoV-2-negative healthy controls. Blood samples were obtained from 12 patients

216

with severe COVID-19 within 72 hours from intensive care unit (ICU) admission in two

217

reference centers (Instituto Estadual do Cérebro Paulo Niemeyer and Hospital Copa Star,

218

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Severe COVID-19 was defined as critically ill patients presenting

219

viral pneumonia on computed tomography scan and in mechanical ventilation. All

220

patients had SARSCoV-2 confirmed diagnostic through RT-PCR of nasal swab or

221

tracheal aspirates. Peripheral vein blood was also collected from 8 SARS-CoV-2-negative

222

healthy control participants as tested by RT-PCR on the day of blood sampling. The

223

characteristics of severe (n = 12), and control (n = 8) participants are presented in Table

224

1. Severe COVID-19 patients usually present older age and higher prevalence of

225

comorbidities as obesity, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes as in previously reported

226

patient cohorts. In the present study, the SARS-CoV-2-negative control group was

227

designed to include subjects of older age and chronic non-communicable diseases, so it

228

is matched with critically ill COVID-19 patients (Table 1). Patients with acute respiratory

229

distress syndrome (ARDS) were managed with neuromuscular blockade and a protective

230

ventilation strategy that included low tidal volume (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight)

231

and limited driving pressure (less than 16 cmH2O) as well as optimal PEEP calculated

232

based on the best lung compliance and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. In those with severe ARDS and

233

PaO2/FiO2 ratio below 150 despite optimal ventilatory settings, prone position was

234

initiated. Our management protocol included antithrombotic prophylaxis with enoxaparin

235

40 to 60 mg per day. Patients did not receive routine steroids, antivirals or other anti-

236

inflammatory or anti-platelet drugs. The SARS-CoV-2- negative control participants

237

were not under anti-inflammatory or anti-platelet drugs for at least two weeks. All clinical

238

information were prospectively collected using a standardized form - ISARIC/WHO

239

Results

254

SARS-CoV-2 promotes pyroptosis in human monocytes

255

To characterize the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers monocyte death,

256

human primary monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 or treated with LPS+ATP.

257

Next, cell death was analyzed by quantifying the LDH activity in the culture supernatant,

258

and by AnnexinV/propidium iodide (PI) cell labeling through for flow cytometry and

259

fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 1A, SARS-CoV-2 increased LDH levels

260

similarly to the positive control, LPS+ATP (Figure 1A). Flow cytometry and fluorescence

261

microscopy images demonstrated higher percentages of PI+ cells in the infected cultures,

262

as well as a significant increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Both, LDH leak

263

and PI labeling characterize cell membrane disruption in human monocytes after SARS-

264

CoV-2 infection (Figure 1B-E). These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can

265

induce cell death characterized by loss of plasma membrane integrity suggestive of

266

pyroptosis cell death.

267

SARS-CoV-2 induces pyroptosis in monocytes through inflammasome activation

268

To gain insights on the mechanisms of monocyte cell death in SARS-CoV-2

269

infection, we accessed caspase-1 activation - a key events that require inflammasome’s

270

proteolytic activity. Cells stimulated with LPS+ATP were used as a positive control of

271

inflammasome activation. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 induced pro-caspase-1

272

cleavage, similarly to positive control (Figure 2A and 2B). To confirm these results, cells

273

were labeled with FAM-YVAD-FLICA (as an indicative of caspase-1 activation) and

274

analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the

275

activation of caspase-1 in monocytes in the same magnitude to the positive control group

276

(Figure 2C and 2D). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-induced caspase-1 activation was a

277

specific event, since we did not observe activation of the apoptotic caspases-3 and -7 in

278

infected monocytes (Figure 2E and 2F). As caspase-1 activity is critical for the production

279

of IL-1β (19,20), we measured the levels of this cytokine in our experiments. Our data

280

show that SARS-CoV-2 infection was able to increase IL-1β production, this

281

phenomenon being prevented with pretreatment with AC-YVAD-CMK, and not altered

282

with a necroptosis inhibitor. (Figure 2G). Importantly, inhibition of IL-1R engagement

283

reduced SARS-CoV-2-mediated caspase-1 activation and LDH release (Figure S1),

284

suggesting that inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion amplify caspase-1 activation

285

and pyroptosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

286

Inflammasome activation amplify pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in infected

monocytes

immune response, we quantified the production of key cytokines in the amplification of

290

the inflammatory process observed clinically in a patient during the course of the

291

infection with IL-6 and TNF-α. Remarkably, caspase-1 specific inhibition, but not pan-

292

caspase or RIPK1 inhibitor, also led to lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines

293

IL-6 and TNF-α, highlighting the participation of the caspase-1-IL-1β axis in

294

inflammatory amplification during SARS-CoV-2 infection. (Figure 3A and 3B). To

295

confirm the effects in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the immune response, whether the

296

observed effect is specifically related to inflammasome activation, we evaluated the

297

production of IL-8, in which induction is independent of the inflammasomes pathway.

298

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a higher IL-8 production, which was not prevented by

299

caspase-1 inhibition (Figure 3C). In addition, inhibition of IL-1R engagement reduced

300

SARS-CoV-2-mediated was able to significantly decrease the production of IL-1 β, IL-

301

6, TNF-α and did not alter the production of IL-8 (Figure S2).

304

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 decreases the expression of HLA class II in human

305

monocytes independently of the activation of inflammasomes

306

To investigate the impact of inflammasome activation and cell death through

307

pyroptosis on the orchestration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, cells were then

308

marked with HLA-DR and analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that SARS-CoV-2

309

infection induced a decrease in HLA-DR expression in monocytes (Figure 4A and 4B).

310

However, the inhibition of caspase-1 (Figure 4A and 4B) and IL-1R engagement (Figure

311

S3) did not prevent the SARS-CoV-2-mediated decreasing of HLA expression. These

312

results suggest that even in disassociation with the engagement of SARS-CoV-2-induced

313

inflammasome activation, monocytes exposed to the new CoV will present limited ability

314

to orchestrate the immune response.

315

Atazanavir prevented inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis

316

Given our findings that pyroptosis and decreased HLA-DR expression are

317

triggered during SARS-CoV-2 replication, we tested whether atazanavir (ATV), an HIV

318

protease inhibitor recently shown to possess antiviral activity against the new CoV in

319

monocytes (17), could prevent these events. Flow cytometry analysis of SARS-CoV-2-

320

infected monocytes treated with ATV demonstrated a significant reduction in caspase-1

321

activity, observed by the decreased FAM-YVAD-FLICA labeling (Figure 5A and 5B).

322

Other orally available repurposed anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, such as lopinavir (LPV) and

323

ribavirin (RBV), did not affect SARS-CoV-2-induced pyroptosis (Figure 5C). Moreover,

324

treatments with ATV did not alter the activity of caspase-1, -3 and -7 in monocytes

325

exposed to LPS and ATP, used as a positive control of pyroptosis (Figure S4), indicating

326

a specific antiviral activity of this drug. Consistently, treatment with ATV also reduced

327

the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in SARS-CoV-2-infected monocytes, when

328

compared to the untreated cells (Figure 5D-F). ATV did not interfere with the production

329

of IL-8, which is independent of inflammasome engagement (Figure 5G).

330

We then confirmed whether ATV can prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced pyroptosis.

331

Lower levels of LDH were detected in the supernatants of SARS-CoV-2-infected

332

monocytes treated with ATV, when compared to infected and untreated cells (Figure 5H).

333

The treatment with ATV was also able to prevent the decrease of HLA-DR expression in

334

infected monocytes (Figure 5I and J). LPV and RBV did not alter the HLA-DR expression

335

in monocytes infected with SARS-Cov-2 (Figure S5). Since ATV inhibits the early

336

proteolytic processing of viral antigens, an early event during SARS-CoV-2 replication,

337

this drug represented the most upstream process pharmacologically inhibited in this

338

investigation to prevent pyroptosis and HLA-DR knockdown.

339

Inflammasome activation and pyroptosis are risk factors in critically ill COVID-19

340

patients

341

To clinically validate our findings, we evaluated if monocytes obtained from

342

critically ill patients with COVID-19 would also display signals of inflammasome

343

engagement and pyroptosis. We observed that monocytes from COVID-19 patients had

344

increased caspase-1 activation (Figure 6A and 6B) and significantly higher PI+ staining,

345

when compared to monocytes from healthy donors (HD) (Figure 6C and 6D).

346

Corroborating with our in vitro data, we also detected higher levels of IL-1β in the plasma

347

of critically ill patients (Figure 6E). Therefore, the in vitro results from the previous

348

sections stand on the shoulders of the clinical relevance of monocytes in patients with

349

severe COVID-19.

A representative scheme to summarize the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection upon

353

in the increase of TNF-α and IL-6 levels, as part of an immunodysregulation promoted

354

by pyroptosis. SARS-CoV-2-induced pyropotosis engages inflammasomes, to activate

355

caspase-1 and IL-1ß. Release of IL-1ß amplify the activation of inflammasomes during

356

the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In parallel, SARS-CoV-2 also induces the HLA-DR

357

downregulation. ATV prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced deleterious effects on monocyte

358

biology.

359

Discussion

360

COVID-19 has caused in less than 8 months over 800,000 deaths worldwide (21)

361

and represent the major public health crisis of the beginning of 21st century, leading to an

362

unpredictable impact in global economics (22,23). SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an

363

uncontrolled inflammatory response and marked leukopenia with consequent

364

lung/respiratory dysfunction, which are the characteristics of the most severe

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.20182055; this version posted October 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

365

manifestations of the COVID-19 (24,25). Similarly, to other respiratory viruses (26-29),

366

SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm, characterized by an uncontrolled inflammatory

367

response mediated by monocytes/macrophages, when they should orchestrate the

368

antiviral immune response (30). In this work, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection

369

triggers inflammasome activation, increases IL-1ß secretion by monocytes, resulting in

370

pyroptotic cell death, which could be a key event for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in

371

critically ill patients (31). This deleterious immune dysregulation loop triggered by

372

SARS-CoV-2 may be impaired by ATV.

373

Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 leads to an intense cell death in human

374

monocytes, observed by the increase in LDH release in infected cultures, as well as by

375

the higher number of PI+ cells when compared to uninfected controls. Even though the

376

pretreatment of infected monocytes with the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK

377

prevented IL-1β secretion, it was not able to prevent the release of LDH. Indeed, others

378

have demonstrated that the treatment with ZVAD-FMK induces necroptosis in diverse

379

cell types (32-34). Notably, as pyroptosis is an inflammatory and programmed cell death

380

mediated by inflammasome and inflammatory caspase-1 activation (10,11), we

381

investigated the engagement and activation of these structures in human monocytes

382

infected with SARS-CoV-2. Activation of caspase-1 and increased production of IL-1ß

383

were observed in infected monocytes. This is correlated to the activation of

384

inflammasomes, because the pretreatment of infected monocytes with YVAD prevented

385

caspase-1 activation. These in vitro results are in accordance with the literature and with

386

our finding described here that indicate the formation of inflammasomes in patients with

387

severe COVID-19 (35). We also showed that the release of IL-1ß could be promoted by

388

the activation of inflammasomes during the SARS-CoV-2 infection, because blockage of

389

IL-1ß receptors reduced caspase-1 activation and cell death. These results corroborate

390

with studies showing that the increase in IL-1ß production is associated with severe

391

COVID-19 (36-38). Under our experimental conditions, the increase in IL-1ß precedes

392

the unbalanced IL-6 release. These information should not be neglected when considering

393

biopharmaceuticals to tackle cytokine storm in severe COVID-19.

394

Monocytes that survived from SARS-CoV-2 infection displayed decreased HLA-

395

DR expression, which has also been described in monocytes isolated from COVID-19

396

patients (39,40). Our results suggest that this modulation of HLA expression is not

397

directly associated with the activation of inflammasomes, and may be involved by other

398

inflammatory pathways, since we and others have observed increased levels of IL-6 by

399

myeloid cells impairing HLA-DR membrane expression (41).

400

To stablish the clinical relevance of SARS-CoV-2-induced pyroptosis in

401

monocytes (41,41), we analyzed peripheral monocytes isolated from patients with severe

402

COVID-19. We found that the cells from the patients displayed higher caspase-1

403

activation, when compared with monocytes isolated from HD. Recent clinical data reveal

404

high levels of LDH and consistent leukopenia in critically ill COVID-19 patients

405

(6,7,35,42-44). Our data also demonstrate intense monocyte death in COVID-19 patients,

406

as detected through flow cytometry analyzes. Altogether, these data suggest that the

407

severity of COVID-19 may be associated with inflammasome activation in monocytes

408

that results in large amounts of IL-1ß and generates an excessive inflammatory response,

409

further characterized by high levels of IL-6 and TNF-α. Consistently, treatment with IL-

410

1RA has been associated with clinical and inflammatory improvements in critically ill

411

COVID-19 patients (45). These results are in line with clinical case reports that

412

demonstrate that monocytes/macrophages are key cells in the deleterious pro-

413

inflammatory events that characterize the most serious cases of COVID-19 (46-49).

414

To the best of our knowledge, effective therapies for COVID-19 should ideally

415

combine antiviral/anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce viral load and to mitigate the

416

cytokine storm. In the present study, we showed that ATV, an antiretroviral approved in

417

2003 for HIV-1 treatment and previously described by us as having anti-SARS-CoV-2

418

effects in different cell types (including monocytes)(50), to block new CoV-induced

419

pyroptosis and HLA-DR knockdown in monocytes. In addition, ATV inhibited the

420

release of LDH and the production of IL-1ß, f IL-6 and TNF-α from SARS-CoV-2-

421

infected monocytes, which are key players in the cytokine storm associated with COVID-

422

19 (51,52).

423

In this work, we originally describe that infection with SARS-CoV-2 can induce

424

pyroptotic cell death by inflammasome activation, which may be related to the intense

425

leukopenia and exacerbated inflammation seen in severe cases of the COVID-19. Since

426

there is no specific therapy for this disease, our results point out that ATV has a promising

427

therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death.

monocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.1) for 24 h. As a positive control,

594

monocytes were stimulated with LPS (500ng/mL) for 23 h and after this time, incubated

595

with ATP (2 mM) for 1 h. (A) Cell viability was assessed through the measurement of

596

LDH release in the supernatant of monocytes. (B, C and D) Monocytes` monolayers were

597

stained with propidium iodide (PI) plus Annexin V and pyroptotic cell death were

S1 Fig. SARS-CoV-2 induce inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in human

989

monocytes by IL-1β amplification. Human monocytes were pretreated with IL-1β

990

receptor (IL-1RA – 1 µM) for 1 h and infected with SARS-Cov-2 (MOI 0.1) for 24 h.

991

Cell viability was assessed through the measurement of LDH release in the supernatant

992

and monocytes were stained with FAM-YVAD-FLICA to determine the caspase-1 and

993

caspase-3/7 activity, respectively, by flow cytometry. Cell culture supernatants also were

994

collected for the measurement of the levels of IL-1β. Data are presented as the mean ±

995

(MOCK). Graphs are representative of four independent experiments.

S3 Fig. Evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of ATV, LPV and ribavirin in LPS-induced monocytes. Human monocytes were stimulated

1058

with LPS (500ng/mL) for 23 h and after this time were stimulated with ATP (2 mM) for 1 h as a positive control group for the formation of

1059

inflammasomes and pyroptosis induction. Simultaneously, cells were treated with atazanavir – ATV (10 µM), LPV (10 µM) or ribavirin (10 µM)

1060

for 24 h. Monocytes were stained with FAM-YVAD-FLICA (blue) or FAM-FLICA (green) to determine the caspase-1 and caspase-3/7 activity

1061

and HLA-DR expression, respectively, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Histograms are representative of six independent experiments.
