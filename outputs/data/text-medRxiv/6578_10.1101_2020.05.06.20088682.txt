Abstract

23

Background: Environmental factors, including air pollution, can strongly impact on

24

spatio-temporal patterns of infectious diseases outbreak. In this study, we aimed to

25

investigate the association and correlation between ambient air pollutants and case

26

fatality rate (CFR) of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China.

27

Methods: Publicly accessible data on COVID-19 average CFR were utilized in the

28

data analysis. The ambient daily air pollutants including fine particulate matter

29

(PM2.5), inhalable particles (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the period from

30

December 25, 2019 to March 5, 2020 were obtained from National Air Quality

the association and correlation between the cumulative average exposure of ambient

33

air pollutants at different lag days (14 and 28 days) and average CFR in China outside

34

Hubei and cities in Hubei province via model fitting.

35

Results: The average case fatality rate was highest in Wuhan city (4.53%) and the

36

cumulative average exposure of ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 at lag 28 days was

37

55.8±12.1μg/m3, 66.8±9.2μg/m3, 20.7±4.4μg/m3, respectively in Hubei province

38

during the study period. Ecological analysis showed that ambient PM2.5, PM10 and

39

NO2 exposure at both lag 14 and 28 days was positively correlated with average CFR

40

in China outside Hubei (province-level). For city-level analysis in Hubei, significant

41

associations were only found between cumulative ambient NO2 exposure and average

42

CFR(r=0.693 for Lag0-14, r=0.697 for Lag0-28, respectively) during the same period.

43

Conclusion: Our findings suggested ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 exposure,

44

especially at 28 lag days, positively associated with the case fatality rate of

45

COVID-19 in China. These results could help provide guidance for identifying

46

potential exposure window and preventing and controlling the epidemic.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing global epidemic event,

60

which caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2)[1].

61

Respiratory droplets and human-to-human contact are the major routes of

62

transmission of COVID-19. Some studies showed that environmental factors might

63

influence the transmissions and risk of COVID-19[2, 3]. Since COVID-19 is a

64

respiratory infectious disease and SARS-CoV-2 could remain viable in aerosols for

65

hours [4], it’s interesting to investigate the associations between air pollution and

66

COVID-19 infection ,and identify possible indicator of air pollutants for blocking the

67

epidemic. However, the study on the effects of air pollutants on the death risk of

68

COVID-19 infection was still limited and inconsistent in China. In this study, we

69

aimed to investigate the associations between ambient air pollutants exposure and

70

case fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 in Mainland China, to provide scientific

71

guidance for identifying potential exposure time window and preventing and

72

controlling the epidemic.

73
74

Methods

75

For this multi-city ecological study , we collected the daily cumulative confirmed

76

and death numbers of COVID-19 cases information in China during the study period

77

from January 22 to March 5, 2020 from the National Health Commissions

78

(http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/xxgzbd/gzbd_index.shtml)

79

Commissions of China (http://wjw. hubei.gov.cn/ bmdt/ztzl/fkxxgzbdgr fyyq/ index.

80

shtml). Due on no death case was reported in 5 provinces (Xizang, Qinghai, Shanxi,

81

Jiangsu and Ningxia) by March 5, 2020 and island-province factor (Hainan), a total of

82

25 provinces covering 256 cities (243 cities outside Hubei, 13 main cities in Hubei)

83

were included in our study. The average case fatality rate of COVID-19 was

84

calculated in China outside Hubei at province-level, and in each city of Hubei

85

province during the same period. Due on the data were all from public websites, the

87

The data on daily average concentrations of air pollutants including fine

88

particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particles (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)

89

during the period from December 25, 2019 to March 5, 2020 was obtained from

90

National Air Quality Real-time Publishing System of China. This platform provided

91

the real-time criteria air pollutants in all state-controlled monitoring stations. To

92

control for the potential confounders, the ambient daily average temperature, relative

93

humidity for each city was obtained from China Meteorological Data Service Center

94

(http:// data. cma. cn/en).

95

The temporal cumulative average exposure of ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 at

96

different lag days (14 days and 28 days) before the daily case reports was evaluated

97

among the cities in Hubei province (city-level) and in China outside Hubei

98

(province-level).

99

Ecological analysis was conducted to explore the temporal associations between

100

the cumulative average exposure of ambient air pollutants and COVID-19 case

101

fatality rates in China outside Hubei (province-level) and in Hubei province

102

(city-level). Multiple regression models were fitted to the data among 24 provinces of

103

China and city-level analysis in Hubei province alone during the study period.

104

Results

105

Among the cities in Hubei province, the cumulative average exposure level of

106

the ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 at lag 28 days was 55.8±12.1μg/m3, 66.8±9.2 μg/m3,

107

20.7±4.4μg/m3, respectively during the study period. The average case fatality rate

108

was highest in Wuhan city (4.53%), followed by Jingmen city and Ezhou city in

109

Hubei province during the study period. For provinces outside Hubei, the average

110

CFR was highest in Heilongjiang province and lowest in Zhejiang province of China.

111

The linear regression analysis showed a positive association between air

112

pollutants exposure and average case fatality rate in China. As indicted in Figure 2,

113

the associations are all significant between average CFR and cumulative average

114

exposure to ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 in both lag 14 and 28 days at

115

province-level in China outside Hubei. The correlation coefficient of NO2 was highest

116

(r=0.739, P<0.001) among the three air pollutants at lag 28 days (Figure 2). For Hubei

117

province, city-level analysis showed a positive association between cumulative

118

average exposure of NO2 and average CFR (r=0.693 for Lag0-14, r=0.697 for

119

Lag0-28, respectively), while no significant associations were observed between

120

ambient PM2.5 and PM10 exposure and average CFR in cities of Hubei province.

121

Discussion

122

Our study suggested that ambient particulate matter and NO2 exposure was

123

associated with the increased case fatality of COVID-19 in Mainland China. These

124

findings could provide evidence that air pollution is an important factor in COVID-19

125

infections.

126

Previous studies has indicated that air pollution associated with a variety of

127

respiratory disease including SARS, influenza, asthma and COPD[5-8]. A recent

128

time-series study showed that ambient particulate matter, NO2 exposure was

129

associated with the increased confirmed case number of COVID-19[9]. A study

130

conducted in multiply countries indicated that long-term exposure to ambient NO2

131

could be a contributor factor to COVID-19 fatality[10]. Consistent with prior studies,

132

our results indicate ambient NO2 exposure, especially at 28 lag days, might increase

133

the CFR of COVID-19. The biological explanation might be that air pollutants could

134

compromise lung function and increase COVID-19 fatality[8].

135

To our knowledge , this was one of the few studies performed in Chinese cities

136

to explore the temporal associations between ambient air pollutants exposure and case

137

fatality rate of COVID-19. The high correlation between ambient NO2 and CFR of

138

COVID-19, especially at 28 lag days exposure, might help identifying which

139

pollutants in certain exposure time window play the dominate the role in increasing

140

the death risk of COVID-19 in China.

141

However, our study has some limitations. First, ecological study designs were

142

adopted in the study, other city-level factors including implementation ability of

143

control policy of COVID-19, the availability of medical resources might confound our

144

findings. Second, the study period may not represent a whole air pollutants pattern

145

associated with the average case fatality rate of COVID-19. Furthermore ,the

146

exposure misclassification might bias the study result due to the different activity

147

patterns of people. For all these limitations, the findings should be interpreted with

148

caution before extension to other population and research.

151

Conclusions
Our study suggest positive associations between ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2

152

exposure and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China. The 28-day lag effects of air

153

pollutants can help to identify the potential exposure window that have the high

154

adverse impact on the COVID-19 and improve the public practice for preventing the

155

epidemic.
