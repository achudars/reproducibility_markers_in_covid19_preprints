Abstract

29

Approximately 15-20% of COVID-19 patients will develop severe

30

pneumonia, about 10 % of which will die if not properly managed. Earlier

31

discrimination of the potential severe patients basing on routine clinical and

32

laboratory changes and commencement of prophylactical management will not

33

only save their lives but also mitigate the otherwise overwhelmed health care

34

burden. In this retrospective investigation, the clinical and laboratory features

35

were collected from 125 COVID-19 patients, who were classified into mild (93

36

cases) or severe (32 cases) groups according to their clinical outcomes after 3

37

to 7-days post-admission. The subsequent analysis with single-factor and

38

multivariate logistic regression methods indicated that 17 factors on admission

39

differed significantly between mild and severe groups, but that only comorbid

40

with underlying diseases, increased respiratory rate (>24/min), elevated C-

41

reactive

42

(LDH >250U/liter), were independently associated with the later disease

43

development. Finally, we evaluated their prognostic values with the receiver

44

operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and found that the above four

45

factors could not confidently predict the occurrence of severe pneumonia

46

individually, but that a combination of fast respiratory rate and elevated LDH

47

significantly increased the predictive confidence (AUC= 0.944, sensitivity=

48

0.941, and specificity= 0.902). A combination consisting of 3- or 4-factors could

49

further increase the prognostic value. Additionally, measurable serum viral RNA

>10mg/liter),

post-admission independently predicted the severe illness occurrence. In

51

conclusion, a combination of general clinical characteristics and laboratory

52

tests could provide high confident prognostic value for identifying potential

severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

Background

61

The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) seems to sweep across the globe

62

ever since its first successful jump from bat to the human being through a yet

63

unknown intermediate(s) approximately in late Nov 2019, still showing a

64

tendency of explosive number increase worldwide [1-3]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus

65

seems more contagious than its sibling virus, severe acute respiratory

66

syndrome (SARS) virus which outbroke in 2003, because over 120,000

67

individuals contract COVID-19 pneumonia within three months by March 11,

68

which was about 15 times of total SARS cases (8000 in 7 months) [4]. The

69

surging increase of COVID-19 patients within a short time window severely will

70

absorb and occupy the limited medical resource, including physicians, nurses,

71

protective suits, masks, and goggles. Data from the China mainland showed

72

that the majority of total infected patients will recover under simple supervision

73

management, such as quarantined in compartment hospital isolated ward, but

74

that the overall case fatality rate was 2.3% [5]. For the clinical treatment of

75

COVID-19 patients under shortage of enough medical supplies, the critical

76

issue and priority are to treat the severe COVID-19 patients (about 20% of the

77

whole population [5]) and to save their lives with preventive and intensive

78

medical care. However, The clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients differed

79

substantially, including asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract

80

illness, and severe viral pneumonia[2, 6-8]. Therefore, the most crucial issue is

81

to identify these patients and prioritize their treatment strategy by applying

82

prophylactically medical treatment and management before they progress to

83

the severe stage.

84

As known, the respiratory function worsens in the severe stage. In the

85

clinical practice, saturated oxygen (< 93% in rest state), reparatory rates (>30

86

times/min), and deteriorated chest radiology imaging (X-Ray and CT more high

87

resolution) provide references to confirm their severity [5, 9, 10]. Because of

88

the hypoxia stress, most patients will experience an over reactivated immune

89

storm, including elevated their expression level of some specific immunological

90

cytokines and changes of certain types of immune cell counts [6, 11]. Biopsy

91

analysis also showed that the lung bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with

92

cellular fibromyxoid exudates [12]. However, the CT imaging and immunology

93

detection is not only expensive but also far unavailable as for the explosive

94

increase of suspected cases, in particular in those hospitals not well equipped.

95

Can some routine clinical characteristics or/and laboratory measurement, or

96

their combinations predict the occurrence of severe cases?

97

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of

98

those patients who progressed to severe pneumonia later and found that five

99

simple clinical features and laboratory detection at an earlier time point could

100

serve as prognostic factors facilitating discrimination of severe cases in

101

advance.

Methods

104

Patients

105

COVID-19 diagnosis was according to the criteria in the new Coronavirus

106

pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (trial version 6) issued by the National

107

Health and Health Commission [13]. All 298 COVID-19 patients admitted to

108

Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 20 to February 29, 2020,

109

were included in this study. This study complied with the medical ethics of

110

Guangzhou Eighth People’s Hospital. We obtained written consent from the

111

patients.

112

For this analysis, inclusion criteria were as the following: 1. diagnosed as

113

mild or ordinary on admission; 2. The length of hospitalization > 3 days, and the

114

overall duration of the disease > 7 days. Then, qualified patients were classified

115

into mild symptom group and severe symptom group based on the clinical

116

manifestation. The severe symptom diagnosis was according to criteria as

117

following: 1) Respiratory distress, RR ≥ 30 times/min in the resting state; 2)

118

Oxygen saturation ≤ 93% in the resting state; 3) Arterial blood oxygen partial

119

pressure (PaO2) / oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤ 300mmHg). The rest of the

120

patients were in the mild group.

classification (course duration> 7 days), laboratory test results and SARS-CoV-

125

2 viral test results were obtained with standardized data collection forms from

126

electronic medical records.

127

Statistical analysis

128

Quantitative data was firstly tested to be normality distribution with the

129

Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. Then, for normalized distributed data, t-test and

130

Tamhane T2 methods were used for variance even and uneven data,

131

respectively. For non-normal data, which was expressed as the median

132

(quartile) [M (P25, P75)], the Mann-Whitney U test was employed. The chi-

133

square test (or Fisher exact probability method) was utilized for analyzing

134

qualitative data. Logistic regression analysis and the receiver operating

135

characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was employed to analyze the independent

136

risk factors. The difference was statistically significant at P <0.05. All analysis

137

was performed using SPSS software (version 20.0).

144

excluded for reasons that 23 cases were already in severe symptom stage, 52

145

cases for a short hospitalization time of < 7 days, and 98 patients for other

146

defects, such as short of a complete set of detection. Finally, 125 cases,

147

including 63 males and 62 females, were qualified to be included for further

148

investigation, and all their disease courses were over seven days, with a

149

maximum of 32 days. Based on the severity of disease at 3-days post-

150

admission, 93 patients fell in the mild group (general 38 cases and mild 55

151

cases) and 32 patients in severe group (severe 25 cases and critical 7 cases).

152

All included patients aged from 1.5 to 91 years (averaged 44.87 ± 18.55

153

years) (Table 1). Among them, 37 cases had at least one underlying disease,

154

including 20 cases with hypertension, 8 cases with diabetes, 5 cases with

155

coronary heart disease, 2 cases with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2

156

cases with chronic kidney disease, 2 cases with chronic liver disease, 2 cases

157

with sleep apnea syndrome. Five individuals with two or more basic disorders

158

and 7 cases with obesity (BMI> 26). Epidemiologically, 88 cases had a history

159

of traveling to or living in the Hubei epidemic area before disease onset.

160

Interestingly, we observed that seven patients developed serum SARS-CoV-2

161

viral RNA positive after admission but ahead of diagnosis to be a severe

162

symptom.

group and the severe group (Table 1). More patients in the severe group were

166

old, with obese (BMI> 26), and with underlying diseases, especially with

167

hypertension and diabetes (P <0.05) compared with the mild group. Among the

168

general factors, no significant difference showed in gender, history of traveling

169

to or living in the epidemic region, coughing, sneezing, muscle joint pain,

170

headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms between these two groups

171

(P>0.05). However, more patients in the severe group were with high fever and

172

chest tightness and breath shortness (fast respiratory rate) (P <0.05). The

173

serum concentration of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, albumin, and

174

lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increased significantly in the severe group (P

175

<0.05).

176

Compared to the mild group, patients in the severe group had lower

177

absolute lymphocyte counts and higher eosinophil counts (P <0.05), and similar

178

levels of other parameters, including white blood cells, neutrophils, platelets,

179

hemoglobin, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, blood

180

lactic acid, blood creatinine, creatine kinase. Interestingly, the levels of

181

glutamate aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)

182

significantly increased for severe patients (P<0.05). However, the median

183

values of ALT and AST were still within the normal range, indicating that most

184

of the severe COVID-19 patients had no significant liver damage.

185

Importantly, all seven patients with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA

187

progressed to severe stage, including two severe cases and five critical cases

(P <0.05).

Binary Logistic Regression Analysis of COVID-19 Severe Risk Factors

190

Next, all categorical variables were converted into covariates, including age,

191

presence of underlying diseases (Yes or No), hypertension (Yes or No),

192

diabetes (Yes or No), obesity (Yes or No), Temperature (<37.4 ℃ , 37.4-

193

38.5℃, >38.5℃), fast respiratory rate (Yes or No), elevated C-reactive protein

194

(>10 mg/liter), decreased lymphocyte count (<1.1*10E9/L) and eosinophil count

195

(<0.02*10E9/L), elevated procalcitonin (>0.05ng/L), elevated D-dimer ( >=2.25

196

ug/L), decreased albumin (<35g/L), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase

197

(LDH, >250U/L), and subjected to single-factor logistic regression together with

198

multiple independent variables. Those variables with statistical significance

199

were chosen for subsequent binary logistic regression analysis testing the

200

model coefficients, goodness-of-fit, and multicollinearity. Four factors identified

201

to be significantly relevant to the severity of COVID-19 were underlying

202

diseases (X1), fast respiratory rate (>24times/min) (X2), elevated C-reactive

203

protein level (CRP >10mg/L) (X3), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level

204

(LDH >250U/L) (X4) (Table 2). Finally, the multifactor logistic regression

205

equation was obtained to be logit P = -6.488 + 2.752X1 + 4.056X2 + 2.424X3

206

+ 5.392X4. The β values and odds ratios (OR) for each factor were shown (table

207

2). The result indicated that elevated LDH ranks the highest correlated with

208

severe symptom development (OR=219.608), followed by the fast respiratory

209

rate (OR=57.726), with underlying diseases (OR=15.67) and elevated CRP

210

(OR=11.289).

211

212

The prognostic capacity for severe symptom development

213

To better evaluate the prediction capacity of each independent risk factors,

214

we plotted their receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for the

215

development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and calculated their area under

216

the ROC curve (AUC value), sensitivity, specificity, Cut-off value, Youden index

217

and p-value (Table 3). According to the general standard that AUC values

218

between 0.7 and 0.9 means a medium level of diagnostic values, and over 0.9

219

means a high level of diagnostic values, we observed that all the factors

220

(AUC<0.9) failed to provide high prognostic value when used alone. Then, we

221

two-factor combination test showed that the combination of fast respiratory rate

222

and elevated LDH could provide a high confident prediction (AUC=0.944,

223

sensitivity=0.941, and specificity=0.902) (Table 3). The AUC values of elevated

224

LDH plus underlying diseases or plus elevated CRP were both over 0.9, but

225

their sensitivity or specificity was lower than 0.9. Then, triple factor combination

226

significantly increased the prognostic efficacy, and all combinations had

227

increased sensitivity and specificity (Table 3). Finally, we calculated the

228

prognostic value of the combination of all four factors and found that the AUC

229

value was significantly increased to 0.985 (95% CI 0.968 ~ 1.000), the

230

sensitivity to 0.912, and the specificity to 0.957 (Table 3).

231

232

Discussion

233

Our study showed that underlying disease, fast respiratory rate (>24

234

times/min), elevated serum C-reactive protein level (CRP, >10mg/L), and

235

elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH, >250U/L) were four independent

236

risk factors for predicting the progression of some COVID-19 patients from mild

237

to severe conditions. Firstly, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level ranked as

238

the number 1 (OR=219.332), and fast respiratory rate ranked as the number 2

239

(OR=57.726) among the four factors (Table 2). Interestingly, elevated lactate

240

dehydrogenase level was associated with severe SARS infection [14], which

241

outbroke in 2003, but was absent in the severe MERS infection[15] which is still

242

circulating. When used individually, all four factors have a moderate prediction

243

value for their low specificity and sensitivity (AUC values <0.9) (Table 3).

244

Secondly, we found that the combination of two factors, fast respiratory rate

245

plus elevated LDH, could provide a high prognostic value for severe symptom

246

development

247

Combinations of triple factors could significantly increase the prognostic value

248

(AUC>0.9). Finally, a combination of all four factors, provide an excellent

(AUC=0.944,

sensitivity=0.941,

and

specificity=0.902).

prognostic efficacy, achieving AUC=0.985 (95% CI 0.968 ~ 1.000) with high

250

sensitivity (0.953), and specificity (0.968).

251

Our hospital has treated over 80% of COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou city,

252

298 cases as of February 29, 2020, including 55 severe cases, but only one

253

death case. All the patients except two patients recovered as of March 15. A

254

retrospective analysis of all the cases revealed that the extremely low fatality

255

rate in our hospital (1 of 298 cases, 0.0336%, which was pretty lower than the

256

overall fatality rate (2.3%) in China [5]) was largely attributed to the effect of an

257

expert panel, consisting of physicians from multiple disciplines, including

258

infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, and intensive care unit (ICU), and

259

radiology. Patients newly admitted were reviewed by the panel, and patients

260

who meet several of the following criteria were transferred immediately to the

261

ICU isolation ward for close supervision, including, (1) the illness onset has

262

entered 7-10 days; (2) over 50 years old; (3) obesity, pregnant women, children;

263

(4) with underlying diseases, especially hypertension, diabetes, COPD; (5) fast

264

respiratory rate ; (6) obvious decline in spirit and appetite; (7) Significant

265

reduction and/or progressive decline of peripheral blood lymphocytes; (8)

266

Decreased in albumin; (9) elevated C-reactive protein (10) elevated lactate

267

dehydrogenase;

268

lungs revealed by chest imaging. Once they progressed to the severe stage,

269

they received treatment immediately. The above four prognostic factors, as

270

routine and affordable clinical characteristics, were included in these criteria

and (11) quickly deteriorated, or with two or more lesions in

271

and facilitated their immediate and preventive therapy from a retrospective

272

aspect.

273

All the seven patients who were detected to be serum viral RNA positive

274

developed severe symptoms very soon, which further confirmed our previous

275

observation that detectable 2019-nCoV viral RNA in Blood is a reliable indicator

276

for the further clinical severity [16]. However, as the viral RNA positive rate were

277

low high (7cases of 32 cases, 21.8%) in this study and from other reports [17]

278

and viral RNA detection is expensive, we do not recommend to continuously

279

detecting viral RNA. In this regard, we suggest reserving the precious reagent

280

for confirming virus infection.

281

In conclusion, our study indicated that underlying disease, fast respiratory

rate, elevated serum C-reactive protein level, and elevated lactate

283

dehydrogenase level significantly correlated to the development of severe

284

COVID-19 pneumonia, and that elevated lactate dehydrogenase and fast

285

respiratory rate or plus one or two more other factors can serve as prognostic

286

factors for the discriminating potential severe cases among the mild COVID-19

287

patients. Our study provided convenient, reliable, and affordable references for

288

both patients and physicians to make a high confident decision to commence

289

management and treatment safely.

Figure 1. Enrollment chart of COVID-19 patients. The clinical information of a

374

total of 298 patients admitted to the hospital was reviewed. Patients were

375

excluded according to the criteria 1) already in severe stages, 2) with a disease

376

course <7 days, and 3) other reasons such as incomplete detection panel.

377

Finally, 125 patients were further divided into two groups. The severe group

378

included the patients who developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia later (>3

379

days post-admission). The patients remaining were kept in the mild group.
